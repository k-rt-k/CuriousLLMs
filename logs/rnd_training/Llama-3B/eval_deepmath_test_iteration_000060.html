          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out how many zeros are at the end of the sum of the factorials of the squares from 10² to 99². That is, compute the number of trailing zeros in 10²! + 11²! + 12²! + ... + 99²!. Hmm, trailing zeros in factorials... I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial n! is determined by the number of times 10 divides into n!, which is the minimum of the exponents of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of n!. Since there are usually more 2s than 5s, the number of trailing zeros is given by the sum of floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the terms become zero. 

But here, we are dealing with the sum of multiple factorials, each of which is (k²)! where k ranges from 10 to 99. So, each term is (k²)! and we need to add them all up and find the trailing zeros in the result. 

First thought: When adding numbers, the number of trailing zeros in the sum isn&#x27;t just the minimum of the trailing zeros of the individual terms. For example, 100 + 1 = 101, which has no trailing zeros, even though 100 has two. So, trailing zeros can disappear when adding. But if all the numbers have at least a certain number of trailing zeros, then the sum will also have at least that many. However, if some numbers have more trailing zeros than others, the lower ones might determine the trailing zeros of the sum if they are not canceled out by the higher terms. 

But in this case, the factorials here are all going to be massive numbers. The smallest term is (10²)! = 100! which already has 24 trailing zeros (floor(100/5) + floor(100/25) + floor(100/125) = 20 + 4 + 0 = 24). The next term is 11²! = 121! which has more trailing zeros. Let&#x27;s compute that: floor(121/5) = 24, floor(121/25) = 4, floor(121/125) = 0. So 24 + 4 = 28? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 121 divided by 5 is 24.2, so floor is 24. 121 divided by 25 is 4.84, floor is 4. Divided by 125 is 0.968, floor is 0. So total trailing zeros for 121! would be 24 + 4 + 0 = 28. Wait, but 100! has 24 trailing zeros, 121! has 28. Wait, 28 is more than 24. Then as k increases from 10 to 99, k² ranges from 100 to 9801. So, the factorials involved here go from 100! up to 9801!.

But the problem is that when you add numbers with different numbers of trailing zeros, the trailing zeros in the sum will be determined by the smallest number of trailing zeros among the terms, unless the digits beyond the trailing zeros in the numbers with more zeros add up to a number that creates additional zeros. But given the magnitude of these factorials, the numbers with more trailing zeros are astronomically larger than the ones with fewer. Wait, but actually, in terms of the trailing digits... Let me think.

Wait, for example, consider 100! + 121!. 100! has 24 trailing zeros, 121! has 28 trailing zeros. So, 100! is a number that ends with 24 zeros, and 121! is a number that ends with 28 zeros. If you add them together, the sum would have 24 trailing zeros, because the last 24 digits of 121! would be zeros, and the last 24 digits of 100! are zeros. Adding them would give zeros in those positions unless there&#x27;s a carryover. But since 121! is much larger than 100!, the digits beyond the 24th position in 121! are non-zero, and when you add 100! (which has zeros beyond the 24th position) to 121!, the result would have the same last 24 digits as 121! except possibly modified by the addition. Wait, but 100! is much smaller than 121!. So, 100! is negligible compared to 121!.

Wait, actually, 100! is 100 × 99 × ... × 1, and 121! is 121 × 120 × ... × 1. So 121! = 121 × 120 × ... × 101 × 100!. Therefore, 121! is 121 × 120 × ... × 101 times 100!. So, 121! is a multiple of 100! multiplied by those extra terms. Therefore, 121! is a multiple of 100! So, when you add 100! + 121!, it&#x27;s like 100! × (1 + 121 × 120 × ... × 101). Since 121 × 120 × ... × 101 is an integer much larger than 1, so 100! + 121! = 100! × (1 + some huge integer). Therefore, the trailing zeros of the sum would be at least the number of trailing zeros in 100!, which is 24. However, is there a possibility that 1 + that huge integer could introduce factors that reduce the number of trailing zeros? For example, if that huge integer is congruent to -1 mod some power of 10, then 1 + huge integer could be 0 mod 10^k. But given that the huge integer is divisible by 10^4 or something, maybe?

Wait, actually, 100! has 24 trailing zeros, so 100! is divisible by 10^24. The term 121! is divisible by 10^28. So when you add 100! + 121!, the sum is divisible by 10^24, but not necessarily by 10^25. Because 100! is congruent to A mod 10^25, where A is some number with 24 trailing zeros, and 121! is congruent to 0 mod 10^25 (since it has 28 trailing zeros). So 100! + 121! ≡ A mod 10^25. Since A is not zero mod 10^25, the sum would have exactly 24 trailing zeros. But 121! is much larger than 100!, so when you add them, the trailing digits beyond the 24 zeros of 100! would be from 121! which has more zeros. Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully.

Wait, actually, when you add two numbers with different numbers of trailing zeros, the number of trailing zeros in the sum is the minimum of the two. For example, 100 + 1 = 101, which has zero trailing zeros. But if the numbers are such that the digits beyond the trailing zeros of the smaller one don&#x27;t affect the trailing zeros. For example, 1000 + 100 = 1100, which has two trailing zeros. So in that case, even though 1000 has three and 100 has two, the sum has two. But here, 100! is way smaller than 121!, so when you add them, the trailing zeros of 100! are 24, and 121! has 28. But when adding, the trailing 24 digits of 121! are zeros, and the trailing 24 digits of 100! are zeros, so their sum would have trailing 24 zeros. However, the 25th digit from the end in 121! is a non-zero digit (since 121! has exactly 28 trailing zeros, so digits 25th to 28th are zeros, but the 29th is non-zero). Wait, no: 121! has 28 trailing zeros, so the last 28 digits are zeros. So the 29th digit from the end is the first non-zero digit. 100! has 24 trailing zeros, so the 25th digit from the end is the first non-zero digit. Therefore, when adding 100! and 121!, the sum will have 24 trailing zeros because 100! contributes non-zero digits starting at the 25th position, but 121! has zeros up to the 28th position. So the addition would result in a number where the first 24 digits are zeros, then the 25th digit would be the sum of the 25th digit of 100! (which is non-zero) and the 25th digit of 121! (which is zero, since 121! has 28 trailing zeros). Therefore, the 25th digit in the sum is just the 25th digit of 100!, which is non-zero. Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in the sum is 24. 

Similarly, if we add a number with m trailing zeros and another with n &gt; m trailing zeros, the sum will have m trailing zeros if the m+1 digit from the end in the larger number is zero. Wait, no. Wait, if the larger number has n trailing zeros, then its last n digits are zero. The smaller number has m trailing zeros. So, when adding, the last m digits of both numbers are zeros. If n &gt; m, then the digits from m+1 to n in the smaller number are non-zero, but in the larger number, they are zero. So adding them would result in the last m digits being zeros, and the digits from m+1 to n in the sum being equal to the digits of the smaller number. Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in the sum is m, the smaller number. But in the previous example, if n &gt; m, but the digits from m+1 to n in the smaller number are non-zero, but in the larger number they are zero. So adding them would result in those digits (m+1 to n) being equal to the digits of the smaller number. Therefore, the trailing zeros would be m. 

Wait, but in our case, the &quot;smaller number&quot; in terms of trailing zeros is 100! with 24 trailing zeros, and the &quot;larger number&quot; is 121! with 28. So adding them, the trailing zeros would be 24. However, 121! is much larger in magnitude. Wait, but when adding numbers, the positional digits matter. For example, if you add a small number (like 100) to a very large number (like 10^100), the trailing zeros of the small number are negligible because the large number has non-zero digits beyond its trailing zeros. But in our case, 121! is much larger than 100!, but when written out, 121! is 100! multiplied by a huge number, so 121! = 100! × (101 × 102 × ... × 121). Therefore, 121! is a multiple of 100! times some integer. Therefore, when you add 100! + 121!, you can factor out 100! to get 100! × (1 + 101×102×...×121). Therefore, the trailing zeros of the sum would be the trailing zeros of 100! times (1 + that product). Since 100! has 24 trailing zeros, and (1 + product) is an integer. If (1 + product) is not divisible by 10, then the total trailing zeros would still be 24. If (1 + product) is divisible by 10, then the trailing zeros would be 25. But 101×102×...×121 is a product of numbers, some of which are multiples of 2 and 5. Let&#x27;s see.

Wait, product = 101×102×...×121. Let&#x27;s check if this product is divisible by 10. Well, in that range, there are numbers like 105, 110, 115, 120 which are multiples of 5. 105 = 5×21, 110 = 5×22, 115 = 5×23, 120 = 5×24. So there are four multiples of 5 in that product. Also, there are plenty of multiples of 2. Therefore, the product is divisible by 5^4 × 2^4 (at least). Therefore, the product is divisible by 10^4. Therefore, product ≡ 0 mod 10^4. Therefore, (1 + product) ≡ 1 mod 10^4. Therefore, (1 + product) is congruent to 1 modulo 10^4, which means it is not divisible by 10. Therefore, 100! × (1 + product) has exactly 24 trailing zeros. Therefore, 100! + 121! has 24 trailing zeros. 

Therefore, in this case, even though 121! has more trailing zeros, the sum 100! + 121! has the same number of trailing zeros as 100!.

Similarly, if we add more terms, like 144! (which is 12²!), which has even more trailing zeros. Let&#x27;s compute the number of trailing zeros in 144!.

Number of trailing zeros in 144!:

floor(144/5) = 28

floor(144/25) = 5

floor(144/125) = 1

floor(144/625) = 0

Total trailing zeros: 28 + 5 + 1 = 34.

So 144! has 34 trailing zeros. Then, adding 100! + 121! + 144! would be similar. Since 100! is the smallest, with 24 trailing zeros, and 121! and 144! have 28 and 34 trailing zeros. So, when adding these, the trailing zeros of the sum would be determined by the term with the least number of trailing zeros, which is 24. However, as before, 121! and 144! are multiples of 100!, so when we factor out 100!, the sum becomes 100! × (1 + product1 + product2), where product1 is 101×...×121 and product2 is 101×...×144. Then, since product1 and product2 are both multiples of 10^4 (as before), the sum (1 + product1 + product2) is congruent to 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 mod 10^4. Therefore, it&#x27;s 1 modulo 10^4, meaning the trailing four digits are ...0001. Therefore, multiplying by 100! which has 24 trailing zeros, the total trailing zeros would be 24. 

Therefore, even if we add more terms with more trailing zeros, the trailing zeros of the sum will be determined by the term with the least number of trailing zeros, which is 100! in this case. But wait, what if we have multiple terms with the same number of trailing zeros? For example, 10²! is 100!, which has 24 trailing zeros. What about 11²! = 121! has 28, 12²! = 144! has 34, 13²! = 169! Let&#x27;s check the trailing zeros for 169!.

Trailing zeros in 169!:

floor(169/5) = 33

floor(169/25) = 6

floor(169/125) = 1

floor(169/625) = 0

Total: 33 + 6 + 1 = 40.

So 169! has 40 trailing zeros. So, as k increases, the number of trailing zeros in k²! increases. So, all terms from 10²! up to 99²! have at least 24 trailing zeros (the first term) and increasing from there. Therefore, when adding all these terms together, the trailing zeros of the sum will be determined by the term with the least number of trailing zeros, which is 100! with 24. However, we need to confirm that when adding all these terms, the cumulative sum doesn&#x27;t somehow cancel out the trailing 24 zeros. But given that all the terms after 100! are multiples of 100! multiplied by large integers, the sum is 100! × (1 + product1 + product2 + ... + productN), where each product is 101×...×k² for each k from 11 to 99. Each product is divisible by 10^4 (as in the earlier case), so each product is congruent to 0 mod 10^4. Therefore, the sum inside the parentheses is 1 + 0 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1 mod 10^4. Therefore, the entire sum is 100! × (1 + multiple of 10^4). Therefore, 100! × (something congruent to 1 mod 10^4). Since 100! has 24 trailing zeros, multiplying it by a number congruent to 1 mod 10^4 (which doesn&#x27;t add any additional factors of 2 or 5) would result in a number with exactly 24 trailing zeros. Therefore, the total number of trailing zeros in the sum is 24. 

But wait, hold on. Let me check this reasoning again. If the sum S = 100! + 121! + 144! + ... + 99²! and each term after 100! is a multiple of 100!, then S = 100!(1 + 121×...×100! + 144×...×100! + ...). Wait, actually, 121! = 100! × 101×102×...×121, so when you factor out 100!, S = 100! [1 + (101×...×121) + (101×...×144) + ... + (101×...×9801)]. Each term inside the brackets beyond the first 1 is a product of an increasingly large number of terms, each of which is divisible by at least 10^4 (as discussed earlier). Therefore, each of those terms is divisible by 10^4. So the entire bracket is 1 + multiple of 10^4. Therefore, 1 + 10^4×k for some integer k. Therefore, 1 + 10^4×k ≡ 1 mod 10^4. Therefore, the bracket is congruent to 1 mod 10^4. Therefore, S = 100! × (1 + 10^4×k). Since 100! has 24 trailing zeros, multiplying by a number that ends with ...0001 would not add any additional trailing zeros. Therefore, S would have exactly 24 trailing zeros. 

Therefore, the answer should be 24. But let me confirm with another approach.

Alternatively, consider that when you add numbers where all except one have a certain number of trailing zeros greater than the smallest one, the total number of trailing zeros is determined by the smallest. But in reality, when adding numbers with trailing zeros, if the digits beyond the trailing zeros in the numbers with more zeros sum with the non-zero digits of the numbers with fewer zeros to produce a carryover, you could get more trailing zeros. However, given the magnitudes here, the numbers with more trailing zeros are so large that their contribution beyond the trailing zeros is negligible compared to the smaller factorials? Wait, no. Wait, 100! is 10^157 approximately, 121! is 10^200, which is way larger. So, when you add 100! + 121!, the 121! is so much larger that in decimal digits, 100! is insignificant compared to 121!. But trailing zeros are about the last digits. So, even though 121! is much larger, its last 28 digits are zeros. But 100! has 24 trailing zeros, so its last 24 digits are zeros, and the next 4 digits (25th to 28th) are non-zero. Therefore, adding 100! + 121! would result in a number where the last 24 digits are zeros, the 25th to 28th digits are the same as those in 100! (since 121! has zeros there), and then beyond the 28th digit, it&#x27;s dominated by 121!. Therefore, the trailing zeros would still be 24. However, when you add multiple such terms, like 100! + 121! + 144! + ... + 9801!, each subsequent term is larger and has more trailing zeros. However, each term beyond 100! is divisible by 100! and has more factors of 10. Therefore, when you factor out 100!, the sum becomes 100! multiplied by (1 + ... ). The key point is whether the sum inside the parentheses is congruent to 1 modulo 10, 100, etc. Since each term after the first is divisible by 10^4, the sum inside is 1 + multiple of 10^4. Therefore, the trailing digits (beyond the 24 zeros from 100!) would be ...0001, so the total number of trailing zeros remains 24. 

Alternatively, think of the numbers in the sum:

- 100! has 24 trailing zeros.

- 121! has 28 trailing zeros.

- 144! has 34 trailing zeros.

- 169! has 40 trailing zeros.

- ...

- 99²! = 9801! has a huge number of trailing zeros.

Each term after 100! is divisible by 10^28 (since 121! is divisible by 10^28), but 100! is only divisible by 10^24. So when we add 100! + 121! + ... + 9801!, the total sum is congruent to 100! modulo 10^25. Because all the other terms are divisible by 10^28, which is a multiple of 10^25. Therefore, the sum is 100! + multiple of 10^25. Therefore, the sum modulo 10^25 is equal to 100! modulo 10^25. Since 100! has exactly 24 trailing zeros, it is divisible by 10^24 but not by 10^25. Therefore, 100! modulo 10^25 is a number with 24 trailing zeros followed by a non-zero digit. Therefore, the sum modulo 10^25 is that number, which is not divisible by 10^25. Therefore, the total sum has exactly 24 trailing zeros.

Thus, the number of trailing zeros in the entire sum is equal to the number of trailing zeros in 100!, which is 24.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{24}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the number of trailing zeros in the sum of the factorials of the squares of all numbers from \(10^2\) to \(99^2\) inclusive, we start by noting that the number of trailing zeros in \(n!\) is given by the sum \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots\). 

The smallest term in the sum is \(10^2! = 100!\), which has 24 trailing zeros. The next term, \(11^2! = 121!\), has 28 trailing zeros, and subsequent terms have increasingly more trailing zeros. 

When adding numbers with different trailing zeros, the number of trailing zeros in the sum is determined by the term with the fewest trailing zeros, provided there is no carryover affecting the trailing digits. However, since each term \(k^2!\) for \(k \geq 11\) is a multiple of \(100!\) (as \(k^2! = 100! \times 101 \times 102 \times \cdots \times k^2\)), the sum can be factored as \(100! \times (1 + \text{product of terms})\).

Each product term is divisible by \(10^4\), making the sum inside the parentheses congruent to 1 modulo \(10^4\). Thus, the trailing zeros of the entire sum are determined by \(100!\), which has 24 trailing zeros. 

Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in the sum of the factorials of the squares from \(10^2\) to \(99^2\) is \(\boxed{24}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out whether this statement is true or false. The statement is: If \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) is a continuous surjective function that takes every value at most a finite number of times, then \( f \) is strictly monotone. Hmm. Let&#x27;s break this down.

First, let&#x27;s recall some definitions. A function is strictly monotone if it&#x27;s either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing over its entire domain. That means, for any two points \( x_1 &lt; x_2 \), either \( f(x_1) &lt; f(x_2) \) everywhere (strictly increasing) or \( f(x_1) &gt; f(x_2) \) everywhere (strictly decreasing). 

The function given here is continuous, surjective, and each value in its codomain \( \mathbb{R} \) is attained at most finitely many times. So, no horizontal line intersects the graph of \( f \) more than finitely many times. The question is asking if these conditions necessarily force the function to be strictly monotone.

My initial thought is that if a function is not strictly monotone, then it must have a local maximum or a local minimum. Because if it&#x27;s increasing in some places and decreasing in others, there must be turning points. But since the function is continuous, these turning points would lead to the function taking the same value more than once in their neighborhoods. However, the function is supposed to take every value at most finitely many times. But how does that interact with strict monotonicity?

Let me consider a non-monotonic continuous function. For example, think of a function that goes up, then down, then up again. Like a cubic function, say \( f(x) = x^3 - 3x \). Wait, but does that take every value at most finitely many times? Let&#x27;s check. For a cubic equation \( x^3 - 3x = c \), the number of real roots depends on the discriminant. The equation \( x^3 - 3x - c = 0 \) will have three real roots if the discriminant is positive, which occurs when \( c \) is between the local maximum and minimum values. Specifically, the critical points are at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1 \). Evaluating \( f \) at these points gives \( f(1) = 1 - 3 = -2 \) and \( f(-1) = -1 + 3 = 2 \). So for \( c \) between -2 and 2, the equation \( x^3 - 3x = c \) will have three real roots, and outside that interval, only one real root. But the problem statement requires that every value is taken at most finitely many times. In this case, three is finite, so maybe this example is not a counterexample because even though it&#x27;s not strictly monotone, it still takes each value at most three times. Wait, but the problem allows &quot;at most a finite number of times,&quot; so even three is okay. But then, such a function would be a counterexample: it&#x27;s continuous, surjective (since it&#x27;s a cubic, it tends to ±infinity as x does), and each value is achieved at most three times. But it&#x27;s not strictly monotone. So does this mean the original statement is false?

Wait, but hold on. The cubic function \( x^3 - 3x \) is surjective, continuous, each value is taken at most three times, which is finite, but it is not strictly monotone. Therefore, this would be a counterexample, so the original statement is false. Therefore, the answer should be False.

But let me verify if my reasoning is correct. The problem states that f is continuous, surjective, and every value is taken at most finitely many times. The cubic function is continuous, surjective (since as x approaches infinity, f(x) approaches infinity, and as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity), and each horizontal line intersects the graph at three points at most, which is finite. Therefore, it satisfies all the given conditions but is not strictly monotone. Therefore, the statement is false. So the answer is False.

But wait, before finalizing, maybe check another example. Let&#x27;s consider a sine function. But the standard sine function is not surjective onto \( \mathbb{R} \), its range is [-1,1]. So that&#x27;s not a good example. If I take a function that is piecewise linear, going up and down multiple times but ensuring that it&#x27;s surjective. But such a function might require infinitely many oscillations, which would make it take some values infinitely often. For example, if you have a function that oscillates with decreasing amplitude but increasing frequency, so that it still goes to infinity... Wait, but if it oscillates, even with increasing amplitude, the problem is that as you approach infinity, maybe the function still hits certain values infinitely many times. Hmm. For example, consider a function like \( f(x) = x + \sin(x) \). This function is continuous, surjective? Let&#x27;s see. As x approaches infinity, \( f(x) \) approaches infinity, and as x approaches negative infinity, it approaches negative infinity. The function is surjective because for any real number y, there exists an x such that \( x + \sin(x) = y \). However, how many times does this function take each value? The equation \( x + sin(x) = c \) has solutions. Because the derivative of f is \( 1 + \cos(x) \), which is non-negative since \( \cos(x) \geq -1 \), so the function is non-decreasing. Wait, but 1 + cos(x) is zero whenever cos(x) = -1, which is at x = π + 2πk. So the function has critical points where the derivative is zero, but between those points, the function is increasing. So actually, \( f(x) = x + sin(x) \) is a function that is surjective, continuous, but not strictly monotone (since it has intervals where it&#x27;s flat). Wait, but does it take each value at most finitely many times?

Wait, if the function is non-decreasing, but not strictly increasing, then at points where the derivative is zero, it might be constant? But no, even though the derivative is zero at isolated points, the function is still strictly increasing. Wait, hold on. Let&#x27;s compute the derivative again. For \( f(x) = x + sin(x) \), the derivative is \( f&#x27;(x) = 1 + cos(x) \). The derivative is equal to zero when \( cos(x) = -1 \), which occurs at \( x = \pi + 2\pi k \), for integers k. At these points, the derivative is zero, but between these points, the derivative is positive (since \( cos(x) &gt; -1 \) elsewhere). Therefore, at each critical point, the function has a horizontal tangent, but since the derivative doesn&#x27;t stay zero on any interval, the function is still increasing overall. So in fact, \( f(x) = x + sin(x) \) is a strictly increasing function. Wait, is that true?

Wait, suppose we have two points x1 &lt; x2. If between x1 and x2 there&#x27;s a critical point where the derivative is zero, does the function still increase? Let&#x27;s take x1 = 0 and x2 = 2π. At x1, f(x1) = 0 + sin(0) = 0. At x2, f(x2) = 2π + sin(2π) = 2π. Now, between 0 and 2π, the function&#x27;s derivative is 1 + cos(x). At x = π, derivative is zero. So the function increases from 0 to π, then has a horizontal tangent at π, but then continues increasing from π to 2π. So overall, from 0 to 2π, it&#x27;s increasing. Therefore, the function is actually strictly increasing, hence strictly monotone. So even though it has points where the derivative is zero, it&#x27;s still strictly increasing. Therefore, this isn&#x27;t a counterexample.

So my initial thought with the cubic function might be the correct counterexample. Let me verify that function again.

Take \( f(x) = x^3 - 3x \). As I mentioned, it&#x27;s a cubic function. Let&#x27;s check surjectivity. For any real number y, the equation \( x^3 - 3x = y \) has a real solution because as x approaches infinity, \( x^3 - 3x \) approaches infinity, and as x approaches negative infinity, it approaches negative infinity. Since it&#x27;s continuous, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, it&#x27;s surjective. Now, how many times does it take each value? For values between -2 and 2, it takes them three times. For values outside that interval, it takes them once. So each value is taken at most three times, which is finite. However, the function is not strictly monotone. It has a local maximum at x = -1 (value 2) and a local minimum at x = 1 (value -2). Therefore, the function is decreasing on (-∞, -1), increasing on (-1, 1), and decreasing again on (1, ∞). So definitely not strictly monotone. Therefore, this function satisfies all the given conditions but is not strictly monotone, hence the original statement is false.

Therefore, the answer should be False.

But wait, before concluding, let me check if there are any restrictions I might have missed. The problem says &quot;takes every value at most a finite number of times&quot;. In the cubic example, each value is taken either once or three times, so that&#x27;s finite. So yes, it satisfies the conditions. Therefore, the statement is indeed false.

Alternatively, another example could be a piecewise function that has two increasing parts and one decreasing part, but constructed in such a way that it&#x27;s still surjective and each value is hit finitely many times. But the cubic example is simpler.

Therefore, I think the conclusion is correct. The statement is false.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the statement is true or false, we need to check if a continuous surjective function \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) that takes every value at most a finite number of times must be strictly monotone.

1. **Definitions and Initial Thoughts**:
   - A strictly monotone function is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.
   - A function that is not strictly monotone must have local maxima or minima, leading to potential multiple intersections with some horizontal lines.

2. **Counterexample Consideration**:
   - Consider the cubic function \( f(x) = x^3 - 3x \).
   - This function is continuous and surjective because as \( x \) approaches \( \pm\infty \), \( f(x) \) approaches \( \pm\infty \), and it covers all real values by the Intermediate Value Theorem.
   - The function \( f(x) = x^3 - 3x \) has critical points at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1 \), leading to local maximum and minimum values of 2 and -2, respectively.
   - For values between -2 and 2, the equation \( x^3 - 3x = c \) has three real roots, and for values outside this interval, it has one real root. Each value is taken at most three times, which is finite.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The cubic function \( f(x) = x^3 - 3x \) is a counterexample because it is continuous, surjective, and each value is taken at most finitely many times, but it is not strictly monotone.

Thus, the statement is false.

Problem: Calculate the flow of the vector field \(\mathbf{F}(x, y, z) = \frac{1}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} (x, y, z)\) out of a sphere with radius 10 and center at the origin. Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to calculate the flow of the vector field F out of a sphere with radius 10 centered at the origin. The vector field is given by F(x, y, z) = (x, y, z) divided by (x² + y² + z²) raised to the 3/2 power. Hmm, flow out of a sphere usually means I need to compute the flux integral of F over the surface of the sphere, right? 

First, let me recall that the flux of a vector field through a closed surface S is given by the surface integral ∬_S F · n dS, where n is the unit normal vector to the surface. In this case, the surface is a sphere of radius 10 centered at the origin. For a sphere centered at the origin, the unit normal vector at any point (x, y, z) on the sphere is just (x, y, z) divided by the radius, because it points radially outward. Since the radius is 10, the normal vector n would be (x, y, z)/10. 

But wait, the vector field F is also in the radial direction. Let me write down F again: F = (x, y, z)/(x² + y² + z²)^{3/2}. Since we&#x27;re on the sphere of radius 10, every point (x, y, z) on the sphere satisfies x² + y² + z² = 10² = 100. Therefore, the denominator simplifies to (100)^{3/2}. Let me compute that: 100^{3/2} is (10²)^{3/2} = 10^{3} = 1000. So F on the sphere simplifies to (x, y, z)/1000. 

So F · n would be [(x, y, z)/1000] · [(x, y, z)/10]. The dot product of (x, y, z) with itself is x² + y² + z² = 100. Therefore, F · n = (100)/(1000 * 10) = 100/(10,000) = 1/100. 

Wait, hold on. Let me check that again. The vector field F on the sphere is (x, y, z)/1000, and the normal vector n is (x, y, z)/10. So when I take the dot product, it&#x27;s [x*(x/10) + y*(y/10) + z*(z/10)] / 1000. That is (x² + y² + z²)/10 divided by 1000. But x² + y² + z² = 100, so that&#x27;s 100/10 = 10, divided by 1000 gives 10/1000 = 1/100. Okay, so F · n = 1/100 everywhere on the sphere. 

Then the flux integral becomes ∬_S (1/100) dS. Since 1/100 is a constant, this is just (1/100) times the surface area of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere is 4πr², so here r = 10, so surface area is 4π(10)² = 400π. Therefore, the flux is (1/100)*400π = 4π. 

But wait, this seems familiar. Is there another way to check this result? Maybe using the divergence theorem. The divergence theorem relates the flux through a closed surface to the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field over the region inside the surface. So if I compute the divergence of F and integrate it over the sphere of radius 10, I should get the same result. Let&#x27;s try that. 

First, compute the divergence of F. The vector field is F = (x, y, z)/(x² + y² + z²)^{3/2}. Let me denote r = (x, y, z) and |r| = sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Then F = r / |r|³. The divergence of F is ∇ · (r / |r|³). 

I remember that for the vector field r / |r|³, which is a radial field, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it is a delta function. But maybe I should compute it explicitly. Let&#x27;s recall that in general, for a radial vector field of the form F = r / |r|ⁿ, the divergence is ∇ · F = (3 - n)/|r|ⁿ. Wait, let me check that. 

Actually, let&#x27;s compute ∇ · (r / |r|³). Let&#x27;s write this out component-wise. The vector field F has components F_x = x / (x² + y² + z²)^{3/2}, similarly for F_y and F_z. Let&#x27;s compute ∂F_x/∂x. 

Using the quotient rule: ∂F_x/∂x = [1*(x² + y² + z²)^{3/2} - x*(3/2)*(2x)*(x² + y² + z²)^{1/2}] / (x² + y² + z²)^3. 

Wait, that seems complicated. Let me instead use the product rule. Let me write F_x = x * (x² + y² + z²)^{-3/2}. Then ∂F_x/∂x = (x² + y² + z²)^{-3/2} + x * (-3/2) * 2x * (x² + y² + z²)^{-5/2}. 

Simplifying: ∂F_x/∂x = (x² + y² + z²)^{-3/2} - 3x² (x² + y² + z²)^{-5/2} = [ (x² + y² + z²) - 3x² ] / (x² + y² + z²)^{5/2 } = (y² + z² - 2x²) / (x² + y² + z²)^{5/2}.

Similarly, ∂F_y/∂y = (x² + z² - 2y²)/(x² + y² + z²)^{5/2}, and ∂F_z/∂z = (x² + y² - 2z²)/(x² + y² + z²)^{5/2}. 

Adding them up for the divergence: [ (y² + z² - 2x²) + (x² + z² - 2y²) + (x² + y² - 2z²) ] / (x² + y² + z²)^{5/2}. 

Let&#x27;s compute the numerator: y² + z² - 2x² + x² + z² - 2y² + x² + y² - 2z². 

Combine like terms: 
- For x²: -2x² + x² + x² = 0
- For y²: y² - 2y² + y² = 0
- For z²: z² + z² - 2z² = 0

So the numerator is 0. Therefore, the divergence of F is zero everywhere except where x² + y² + z² = 0, i.e., at the origin. 

But wait, this seems confusing because if the divergence is zero everywhere except the origin, then by the divergence theorem, the flux through any closed surface not enclosing the origin would be zero, and through any closed surface enclosing the origin would be some constant. But in our case, the sphere of radius 10 does enclose the origin, so the flux should be equal to the integral of the divergence over the volume, but since divergence is zero except at the origin, we need to handle the singularity. 

Alternatively, maybe I recall that the flux of F through any closed surface enclosing the origin is 4π. Wait, that matches the result I got earlier with the surface integral: 4π. So perhaps even though the divergence is zero except at the origin, there is a delta function at the origin contributing to the integral. 

Therefore, using the divergence theorem, since the divergence is 4π δ³(r), integrating over the volume inside the sphere gives 4π, which matches the flux result. 

So both methods give the same result, 4π, so that seems correct. 

But just to make sure, let me verify the flux calculation again. On the sphere of radius 10, F · n = 1/100, surface area is 4π*10² = 400π, so 400π*(1/100) = 4π. Yep, that&#x27;s correct. 

Alternatively, if I think of F as the electric field of a point charge, which is proportional to r / |r|³, then the flux through any closed surface enclosing the charge is proportional to the charge, according to Gauss&#x27;s law. In this case, if F were the electric field, the flux would be 4π times the charge. Here, the result is 4π, which would correspond to a charge of 1. But in our case, the vector field is exactly (x, y, z)/(x² + y² + z²)^{3/2}, which is analogous to the electric field of a unit charge, so the flux should indeed be 4π. 

Therefore, regardless of the method, the flux is 4π. 

Hence, the flow out of the sphere is 4π. 

**Final Answer**
The flow of the vector field out of the sphere is \boxed{4\pi}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To calculate the flow of the vector field \(\mathbf{F}(x, y, z) = \frac{1}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} (x, y, z)\) out of a sphere with radius 10 and center at the origin, we need to compute the flux integral of \(\mathbf{F}\) over the surface of the sphere.

1. **Surface Normal and Vector Field on the Sphere**:
   - The sphere has radius 10, so any point \((x, y, z)\) on the sphere satisfies \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 10^2 = 100\).
   - The unit normal vector \(\mathbf{n}\) at any point on the sphere is \(\frac{(x, y, z)}{10}\).
   - The vector field \(\mathbf{F}\) on the sphere simplifies to \(\frac{(x, y, z)}{1000}\) because \((x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{3/2} = 100^{3/2} = 1000\).

2. **Dot Product Calculation**:
   - The dot product \(\mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{n}\) is \(\left(\frac{(x, y, z)}{1000}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{(x, y, z)}{10}\right)\).
   - This simplifies to \(\frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{1000 \cdot 10} = \frac{100}{10000} = \frac{1}{100}\).

3. **Flux Integral**:
   - The flux integral becomes \(\iint_S \frac{1}{100} \, dS\).
   - The surface area of the sphere is \(4\pi \times 10^2 = 400\pi\).
   - Therefore, the flux is \(\frac{1}{100} \times 400\pi = 4\pi\).

4. **Verification Using Divergence Theorem**:
   - The divergence of \(\mathbf{F}\) is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it behaves like a delta function.
   - Using the divergence theorem, the flux through a closed surface enclosing the origin is \(4\pi\), confirming the result.

Thus, the flow of the vector field out of the sphere is \(\boxed{4\pi}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, let&#x27;s see. I have this problem here where I need to determine if a function f is constant given certain conditions. The function g is continuous, goes to infinity as x approaches infinity (but specifically the difference between g(x) and x goes to infinity), and g has finitely many fixed points. Then, f is continuous and satisfies f composed with g equals f. The question is whether f must be constant.

First, let me parse each part of the problem.

1. **g: ℝ → ℝ is continuous.** So no jumps or breaks in g.

2. **lim_{x→∞} (g(x) - x) = ∞.** This means that as x becomes very large, g(x) grows much faster than x itself. In other words, for large x, g(x) is significantly larger than x. So intuitively, g(x) is going off to infinity much faster than x does. For example, maybe something like g(x) = x + x², but even functions like g(x) = 2x might satisfy this? Wait, if g(x) = 2x, then g(x) - x = x, which also tends to infinity as x→∞. So both g(x) = 2x and g(x) = x + x² satisfy this condition.

3. **g has finitely many fixed points.** Fixed points are solutions to g(x) = x. So the equation g(x) = x has only a finite number of solutions. For example, if g(x) = 2x, the only fixed point is x = 0. If g(x) = x + 1, there are no fixed points. So finitely many fixed points, could be zero or more.

4. **f: ℝ → ℝ is continuous and f∘g = f.** This means that f(g(x)) = f(x) for all real x. So applying g to x doesn&#x27;t change the value of f. That suggests that f is constant on the orbits of g. An orbit of g starting at x is the sequence {x, g(x), g(g(x)), g(g(g(x))), ...}. So if I follow the function g repeatedly applied to x, f is constant along that sequence.

Now, the question is: under these conditions, must f be constant everywhere?

My initial thought is that since f is constant on each orbit of g, and if the orbits under g are dense or cover the entire real line in some way, then f would have to be constant. However, since g is a function that &quot;escapes to infinity&quot; quite rapidly (as per the limit given), maybe the orbits tend to infinity, and the only way f can be constant on all these orbits is if f is constant everywhere.

But I need to think carefully. Let&#x27;s consider what the orbits look like.

Given that g(x) - x tends to infinity as x approaches infinity, this suggests that for sufficiently large x, g(x) is much larger than x. So starting from a large x, each application of g sends the point much further out. So the orbit of such an x would be an increasing sequence tending to infinity. Similarly, what happens for negative x? The problem doesn&#x27;t specify behavior as x approaches negative infinity, so g could do anything there. But since the limit is only specified as x approaches positive infinity, maybe the behavior for negative x is not restricted.

But f has to be continuous on all of ℝ. So even if the positive orbits go to infinity, what about the negative side? Hmm.

Wait, but the problem states that g has finitely many fixed points. Fixed points are where g(x) = x. So, if there are fixed points, those would be points where the orbit doesn&#x27;t move. For example, if c is a fixed point, then f(c) = f(g(c)) = f(c), which is trivial. So f is constant on each fixed point, but fixed points are isolated since there are finitely many.

But for non-fixed points, the orbit either diverges to infinity or maybe converges to a fixed point? But given that g(x) - x tends to infinity as x approaches infinity, for large x, the orbit will keep increasing without bound. So maybe for points that are not fixed, their orbits under g either go to infinity or maybe oscillate? But since g is continuous, maybe the intermediate value theorem applies here.

Wait, but if g has finitely many fixed points, then between any two fixed points, or beyond the last fixed point, the function g(x) - x is either always positive or always negative? Let me recall that if g is continuous, then g(x) - x is also continuous. The fixed points are the zeros of g(x) - x. If there are finitely many fixed points, then the real line is divided into intervals separated by fixed points, and in each interval, g(x) - x is either always positive or always negative.

Given that lim_{x→∞} (g(x) - x) = ∞, so for x sufficiently large, g(x) - x is positive and increasing. Therefore, beyond some point, say x = M, we have g(x) - x &gt; 0, which implies that g(x) &gt; x. So for x &gt; M, applying g repeatedly would send x to infinity. Similarly, maybe for x &lt; some N, the behavior could be different? But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify behavior at negative infinity.

But f has to be continuous everywhere. Let&#x27;s try to see if f must be constant.

Suppose that f is not constant. Then there exist a and b such that f(a) ≠ f(b). But f∘g = f, so f(g(a)) = f(a) and f(g(b)) = f(b). Similarly, f(g^n(a)) = f(a) for all n, where g^n denotes the nth iterate. If the orbit of a under g tends to infinity, then the sequence g^n(a) tends to infinity, but f is continuous, so the limit as n→∞ of f(g^n(a)) should be f(lim_{n→∞} g^n(a)) if the limit exists. But if lim_{n→∞} g^n(a) = ∞, then we need to consider the behavior of f at infinity. However, f is defined on all of ℝ, but we don&#x27;t know if it has a limit at infinity.

Wait, but even if the orbit of a goes to infinity, the function f is constant along that orbit. So if f(g^n(a)) = f(a) for all n, and if the orbit g^n(a) tends to infinity, then for f to be continuous, the value f(a) must be equal to the limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity. Similarly, if another point b has an orbit going to infinity, then f(b) must equal the same limit. Therefore, if all points with orbits going to infinity have f(x) equal to the same limit, then maybe f is constant?

But this is not necessarily the case because maybe different points have different limits? Wait, but f is continuous. Suppose that as x approaches infinity, f(x) approaches some value L. Then, for any sequence x_n tending to infinity, f(x_n) must approach L. But for points a whose orbits tend to infinity, f(a) = f(g(a)) = f(g(g(a))) = ... = L. Therefore, f(a) = L. Similarly, if the orbit of a tends to infinity, then f(a) must be L. However, if there are points that do not tend to infinity under iteration of g, then perhaps f could take a different value there?

But the problem states that g has finitely many fixed points. So, other than the fixed points, all other points either have orbits that tend to infinity or maybe converge to a fixed point? Wait, but if g(x) &gt; x for all x sufficiently large, then for x beyond some M, the orbit of x will increase without bound. For x between fixed points, if there are fixed points, the behavior could be different.

Wait, maybe we can partition the real line into intervals around the fixed points and analyze the behavior there.

Suppose that c_1 &lt; c_2 &lt; ... &lt; c_n are the fixed points of g. Since there are finitely many, they can be ordered. Now, consider the intervals (-∞, c_1), (c_1, c_2), ..., (c_n, ∞). In each interval, since g(x) - x is continuous and has no zeros (because fixed points are only at the c_i), so g(x) - x is either always positive or always negative in each interval.

Given that lim_{x→∞} (g(x) - x) = ∞, so in the interval (c_n, ∞), g(x) - x is positive. Therefore, for x &gt; c_n, g(x) &gt; x, so the orbit of x increases without bound.

Similarly, in the interval (c_{n-1}, c_n), depending on the sign of g(x) - x, the orbits might converge to c_n or c_{n-1} or something else. Wait, if in (c_{n-1}, c_n), g(x) - x is negative, then g(x) &lt; x, so the orbit would decrease, perhaps converging to c_{n-1}. But since there are finitely many fixed points, the behavior between them might be such that the function g(x) either maps the interval into itself or not.

But actually, since g is continuous, and in each interval between fixed points, g(x) - x has constant sign. Suppose in an interval (c_i, c_{i+1}), g(x) - x is positive. Then for x in that interval, g(x) &gt; x. But since there&#x27;s a fixed point at c_{i+1}, maybe the function g maps (c_i, c_{i+1}) into itself? Not necessarily. If in (c_i, c_{i+1}), g(x) &gt; x, then starting from x in (c_i, c_{i+1}), the orbit would increase, but since the next point is g(x) &gt; x, and if c_{i+1} is the next fixed point, then if g(x) &lt; c_{i+1} for x in (c_i, c_{i+1}), then the orbit would converge to c_{i+1}. But if g(x) can jump over c_{i+1}, then maybe the orbit leaves the interval.

But given that g(x) - x tends to infinity as x approaches infinity, in the last interval (c_n, ∞), g(x) &gt; x, and since there are no more fixed points beyond c_n, the orbits there go to infinity. Similarly, in the intervals between fixed points, the behavior could be that orbits either converge to the next fixed point or diverge. But since there are finitely many fixed points, maybe all orbits either converge to a fixed point or go to infinity.

But given that f is continuous and f∘g = f, then if an orbit converges to a fixed point c, then f must be constant along that orbit, so f(x) = f(c) for all x in the orbit. Similarly, for orbits that go to infinity, as I thought before, f must be equal to the limit at infinity (if it exists) on those orbits.

But since f is continuous on ℝ, if different orbits lead to different limits, then f would have to reconcile these different values, which might not be possible unless all these limits are the same.

Alternatively, if f is constant on each orbit, and orbits are dense or something, then f has to be constant. But in this case, the orbits under g can either go to infinity or approach fixed points. So maybe f is constant on each basin of attraction (the set of points that converge to a particular fixed point or go to infinity) but since f is continuous, these constants must agree.

Wait, here&#x27;s an idea. Suppose there are two fixed points, c and d. If there is a point x such that its orbit converges to c, then f(x) = f(c). If there is another point y whose orbit converges to d, then f(y) = f(d). But if the function f is continuous, then if c and d are connected via the real line (i.e., there&#x27;s a path between them), f(c) must equal f(d) because f is constant on each basin but also continuous. Wait, but basins of attraction might not necessarily be connected.

Alternatively, think about the set of fixed points. Since there are finitely many fixed points, say c_1 &lt; c_2 &lt; ... &lt; c_n. For any x in ℝ, either x is one of the fixed points, or its orbit under g either tends to infinity or converges to one of the fixed points. If the orbit converges to a fixed point, then f(x) must equal the value of f at that fixed point. If the orbit tends to infinity, then f(x) must equal the limit of f at infinity, if such a limit exists.

But f is continuous on ℝ, so if f has a limit L as x approaches infinity, then for any sequence x_n → ∞, f(x_n) → L. But for the points x whose orbits tend to infinity, f(x) = f(g(x)) = f(g(g(x))) = ... = L. Therefore, f(x) = L for all x whose orbits tend to infinity. Similarly, for points converging to a fixed point c_i, f(x) = f(c_i). But since f is continuous, if two different fixed points c_i and c_j have f(c_i) ≠ f(c_j), then there would have to be points between c_i and c_j where f takes values between f(c_i) and f(c_j). But these points between c_i and c_j might either converge to another fixed point or go to infinity. Wait, but if between c_i and c_j, the function g(x) - x is either positive or negative. Suppose in the interval (c_i, c_j), g(x) - x is positive, so g(x) &gt; x. Then starting from x in (c_i, c_j), the orbit would increase. If there is another fixed point c_k &gt; c_j, then the orbit might converge to c_k, but if c_j is the last fixed point, then the orbit would go to infinity. Similarly, if g(x) - x is negative in (c_i, c_j), the orbit would decrease, perhaps converging to c_i or a lower fixed point.

Wait, perhaps the key is that between any two fixed points, the behavior of g determines where the orbits go. If in an interval between two fixed points, the function g(x) is either greater than x or less than x throughout. Suppose in (c_i, c_{i+1}), g(x) &gt; x. Then starting in that interval, the orbit increases. If the next fixed point is c_{i+1}, but since g(x) &gt; x in (c_i, c_{i+1}), the orbit would actually leave the interval (c_i, c_{i+1}) unless g maps the interval into itself. But if g(x) &gt; x in (c_i, c_{i+1}), and since g is continuous, maybe g(x) can be greater than c_{i+1} for some x in (c_i, c_{i+1}), which would make the orbit jump out of the interval.

Alternatively, if in the interval (c_i, c_{i+1}), g(x) is between x and c_{i+1}, so that g(x) &gt; x but g(x) &lt; c_{i+1}, then the orbit would converge to c_{i+1}. But unless g is specifically a contraction mapping or something, which isn&#x27;t given here.

But given that g is only given to be continuous with lim_{x→∞} (g(x)-x) = ∞ and finitely many fixed points, we can&#x27;t assume any specific behavior in the intervals between fixed points other than the sign of g(x) - x.

But perhaps the key is that the only fixed points are the c_i&#x27;s, and for any x not equal to a fixed point, the orbit either tends to infinity or to a fixed point.

But given that, f must be constant on the orbits. So if x converges to c_i under iteration of g, then f(x) = f(c_i). If x&#x27;s orbit tends to infinity, then f(x) must equal the limit of f at infinity, say L. But since f is continuous, if there are multiple fixed points with different f values, how does that reconcile?

Suppose there are two fixed points, c and d, with f(c) ≠ f(d). Then, since f is continuous, there must be points between c and d where f takes all values between f(c) and f(d). But if all the points between c and d are either in the basin of attraction of some fixed point or their orbits go to infinity, then f would have to be constant on those basins. However, if between c and d there&#x27;s a mix of points that go to infinity and points that converge to a fixed point, then f would have to be both L (the limit at infinity) and f(c_i) on different parts, but continuity might force these constants to be equal.

Wait, for example, suppose there is a fixed point c, and to the right of c, g(x) &gt; x, so orbits go to infinity. Then, for x &gt; c, f(x) = L. But just to the left of c, what happens? If approaching c from the left, the function f must approach f(c) because f is continuous. But if points just to the left of c are in the basin of attraction of some other fixed point, say d &lt; c, then f(x) = f(d) there. But unless f(d) = f(c), this would create a discontinuity at c, which contradicts the continuity of f. Therefore, perhaps all fixed points must have the same value under f, and also the limit at infinity must be equal to that value.

Alternatively, if there&#x27;s a fixed point c, and immediately to the right of c, the orbits go to infinity (so f(x) = L for x &gt; c), and immediately to the left of c, the orbits might behave differently. If approaching c from the left, the orbits might converge to another fixed point d &lt; c. Then, just to the left of c, f(x) = f(d), but at c, f(c) must equal both the limit from the left (f(d)) and the limit from the right (L). Therefore, f(c) = f(d) = L. Similarly, all fixed points must have f(c_i) = L, and thus f is constant everywhere.

Wait, this seems promising. Let me formalize this.

Suppose f is not constant. Then there exist at least two values, say a and b, with f(a) ≠ f(b). Since f is continuous, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, f takes all values between f(a) and f(b). However, f is constant on each orbit of g. So if a and b are on different orbits, their f values might differ. But if the orbits are &quot;dense&quot; in some way, or if the basins of attraction overlap in a way that requires f to be constant due to continuity, then f must be constant.

Alternatively, think about the set of fixed points. Let’s denote them as c_1 &lt; c_2 &lt; ... &lt; c_n. Now, consider the interval (c_n, ∞). Here, g(x) &gt; x, so iterating g sends x to infinity. Hence, for any x &gt; c_n, f(x) must equal the limit of f at infinity, say L. But f is continuous, so approaching c_n from the right, f(x) approaches L. However, at x = c_n, f(c_n) must equal f(g(c_n)) = f(c_n), which is consistent, but also, approaching c_n from the left, if there is a different behavior.

Suppose just to the left of c_n, in the interval (c_{n-1}, c_n), the function g(x) - x is negative, so g(x) &lt; x. Then, orbits in (c_{n-1}, c_n) would decrease, potentially converging to c_{n-1} or some lower fixed point. If they converge to c_{n-1}, then for x in (c_{n-1}, c_n), f(x) = f(c_{n-1}). But approaching c_n from the left, f(x) approaches f(c_{n-1}), and approaching from the right, f(x) approaches L. Since f is continuous at c_n, we must have f(c_n) = f(c_{n-1}) = L. Repeating this argument for each fixed point, we can see that all fixed points must have the same value under f, and that value must also be equal to the limit of f at infinity. Therefore, f must be constant everywhere.

To make this more precise, suppose that c is the rightmost fixed point. Then, for x &gt; c, g(x) &gt; x, so orbits go to infinity. Therefore, f(x) = L for x &gt; c. By continuity, f(c) = lim_{x→c+} f(x) = L. Now, consider the interval immediately to the left of c. If in that interval, g(x) - x &lt; 0, then orbits there decrease. If they converge to another fixed point d &lt; c, then f(x) = f(d) for x in that interval. But approaching c from the left, f(x) approaches f(d), and since f is continuous at c, f(d) must equal f(c) = L. Therefore, f(d) = L. Repeating this for each fixed point from right to left, each fixed point must have f(c_i) = L. Thus, all fixed points have the same value L under f, and any point not a fixed point either has its orbit converging to a fixed point (hence f(x) = L) or going to infinity (hence f(x) = L). Therefore, f must be constant everywhere with value L.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, f must be constant.

But let me check for possible mistakes in this reasoning.

One possible issue is whether all orbits of points not fixed actually end up either at a fixed point or at infinity. The problem states that g has finitely many fixed points and that lim_{x→∞} (g(x) - x) = ∞. However, there could be other behavior for points not in the basins of attraction of fixed points or infinity. For example, could there be periodic points? If g has a periodic cycle of period greater than 1, then f would have to be constant on those cycles. However, since f is continuous, and if the periodic points are dense or something, then f would have to be constant. But in our case, since g(x) - x tends to infinity, maybe there are no bounded orbits except for the fixed points.

Wait, suppose there is a point x such that the orbit of x is bounded but does not converge to a fixed point. For example, maybe it oscillates between some values. However, given that g is continuous and lim_{x→∞} (g(x) - x) = ∞, which suggests that for large x, g is increasing. But on compact intervals, g is continuous, so maybe by Sharkovsky&#x27;s theorem or something, there could be periodic points. However, Sharkovsky&#x27;s theorem applies to functions defined on an interval, but here g is defined on all of ℝ.

But even if there are periodic points, f would have to be constant on them. For example, if x is a periodic point of period 2, so g(g(x)) = x, then f(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x), which is trivial. So f is constant on the orbit, but if the orbit is finite, then f is just constant on those points. However, if there are infinitely many periodic points, but the problem states that g has finitely many fixed points, not necessarily finitely many periodic points. Wait, but the problem only states finitely many fixed points. It doesn&#x27;t restrict periodic points. However, in our previous reasoning, even if there are periodic points, since f must be constant on each periodic orbit, and f is continuous, the values on different periodic orbits must agree.

But if there is a periodic orbit, say {a, g(a)} where g(g(a)) = a and a is not a fixed point, then f(a) = f(g(a)) = f(a), which is consistent, but for f to be continuous, if between a and g(a) there are points that go to infinity or to fixed points, then f must be constant throughout.

Alternatively, suppose there&#x27;s a point x whose orbit is dense in some interval. Then f would have to be constant on that interval, hence constant everywhere due to continuity. But creating a dense orbit on ℝ seems difficult, especially given that g(x) - x tends to infinity, so maybe most orbits go to infinity.

Alternatively, think about the function f. Since f is continuous and f∘g = f, the level sets of f (the sets f^{-1}(y) for y in ℝ) must be invariant under g. That is, if x is in a level set, then so is g(x). The level sets are closed because f is continuous. Now, if f is not constant, then there exists at least two different level sets. Each of these level sets must be invariant under g. However, since g has finitely many fixed points and sends points to infinity otherwise, the only closed invariant sets under g are the fixed points and the sets that go to infinity. But if a level set contains a point that goes to infinity under iteration of g, then the entire level set must be unbounded. However, if a level set is unbounded, then by the continuity of f, it must contain intervals going to infinity, but f is constant on those intervals. However, if two different level sets exist, they would have to be separated, but since f is continuous, the level sets can&#x27;t be adjacent unless they are the same. Therefore, the only possibility is that f has only one level set, meaning f is constant.

Alternatively, suppose that f is not constant. Then there exist two different values y1 and y2 such that f^{-1}(y1) and f^{-1}(y2) are non-empty. Since f is continuous, these level sets are closed. Moreover, they are invariant under g. If f^{-1}(y1) contains a point x whose orbit goes to infinity, then f^{-1}(y1) must contain all points g^n(x), which tend to infinity. Therefore, f is y1 on an unbounded set going to infinity. But because f is continuous, the limit as x approaches infinity of f(x) must be y1. Similarly, if f^{-1}(y2) contains a point whose orbit goes to infinity, then the limit would also have to be y2, which contradicts the uniqueness of the limit at infinity. Hence, only one of y1 or y2 can be the limit at infinity, say y1. Therefore, f^{-1}(y2) cannot contain any points whose orbits go to infinity; they must be contained in a bounded region. But in a bounded region, the orbits would have to converge to a fixed point. However, since there are finitely many fixed points, and each fixed point has f value y1 (as established earlier), points converging to fixed points must also have f value y1. Therefore, f^{-1}(y2) cannot contain any points, which is a contradiction. Therefore, f must be constant.

Yes, this seems like a solid argument. So, putting it all together, the conclusion is that f must be constant.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a continuous function \( g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) such that \( \lim_{x \to \infty} (g(x) - x) = \infty \) and \( g \) has finitely many fixed points, we need to determine if a continuous function \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) satisfying \( f \circ g = f \) must be constant.

1. **Behavior of \( g \)**: The function \( g \) grows faster than \( x \) as \( x \to \infty \), implying that for sufficiently large \( x \), \( g(x) \) is significantly larger than \( x \). This means orbits of points under \( g \) tend to infinity for large \( x \).

2. **Fixed Points**: \( g \) has finitely many fixed points, which are solutions to \( g(x) = x \). These fixed points divide the real line into intervals where \( g(x) - x \) is either always positive or always negative.

3. **Invariance of \( f \)**: Since \( f \circ g = f \), \( f \) is constant on each orbit of \( g \). For points whose orbits tend to infinity, \( f \) must be constant along these orbits. For points converging to a fixed point, \( f \) must be constant at the value of the fixed point.

4. **Continuity of \( f \)**: The continuity of \( f \) implies that if \( f \) were not constant, there would be different values \( f(a) \neq f(b) \). However, since orbits of points either tend to infinity or converge to fixed points, and \( f \) is constant on these orbits, the continuity of \( f \) forces these constants to agree. 

5. **Conclusion**: Any fixed points must have the same value under \( f \) due to continuity. Similarly, the limit of \( f \) at infinity must match the value at fixed points. Therefore, \( f \) must be constant everywhere.
