          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what&#x27;s given. The term \( a_n \) is a sum from \( k=1 \) to \( n \) of \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Then we need to take the inverse of \( a_n \), raise it to the power of \( 1/n^2 \), and find the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity.

Since the limit involves \( n \) in both the exponent and the sum, maybe I need to analyze the behavior of each term in the sum as \( n \) becomes very large. Then, perhaps the entire sum \( a_n \) can be approximated, and from there, we can take the limit.

Let me start by looking at the general term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). For fixed \( k \), as \( n \) becomes large, \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) becomes very small. However, since \( k \) ranges up to \( n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) is \( \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which also tends to zero as \( n \) grows. So each term in the sum is of the form \( (1 + \text{something small})^{\text{something}} \). Maybe I can use the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) when \( x \) is small. Let me check if that applies here.

If \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \) and \( y = k \), then \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). So perhaps \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \approx e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \). However, the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) is valid when \( x \) is small and \( xy \) is also small? Wait, for fixed \( k \), as \( n \to \infty \), \( x \) is small and \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \) is also small, so the approximation might work. But when \( k \) is comparable to \( n \), say \( k \approx n \), then \( xy = \frac{n^2}{n^2} = 1 \), so in that case, \( x = \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which is small, but \( xy = 1 \), so the approximation might not be so accurate. Hmm, so maybe the terms where \( k \) is small contribute \( e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \), and the terms where \( k \) is large (like near \( n \)) might need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the logarithm of \( a_n \) to turn the product into a sum? Wait, but \( a_n \) is already a sum. Taking logarithm might not help directly. However, since we have \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), taking the logarithm would turn this into \( -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \). So maybe I can compute the limit of \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), and then exponentiate the negative of that limit. Let&#x27;s see.

Let me denote \( L = \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \). Taking natural logarithm on both sides, we have:

\( \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \).

Therefore, if I can compute \( \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), then \( L = e^{- \text{that limit}} \).

So the key is to find the asymptotic behavior of \( \ln(a_n) \) as \( n \to \infty \), specifically its leading term divided by \( n^2 \).

To compute \( \ln(a_n) \), note that \( a_n \) is a sum of terms \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). The logarithm of a sum is tricky, but maybe the sum is dominated by its largest term? If that&#x27;s the case, then \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(\text{largest term}) \). Let&#x27;s check if that&#x27;s true here.

The terms in the sum \( a_n \) are \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s see how \( T_k \) behaves as \( n \to \infty \) for different ranges of \( k \).

Case 1: \( k \) is small compared to \( n \), say \( k = o(n) \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right)^k \approx 1 + o\left( \frac{k}{n} \right) \approx 1 \). So these terms are approximately 1.

Case 2: \( k \) is proportional to \( n \), say \( k = cn \) where \( c \) is a constant between 0 and 1. Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{c}{n} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c} \) as \( n \to \infty \), since \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^n \approx e^{c} \). Wait, but here the exponent is \( cn \), so \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \). Wait, actually:

Let me recall that \( \left(1 + \frac{a}{n} \right)^{bn} \approx e^{ab} \) as \( n \to \infty \). So here \( a = c \) and \( b = c \), so it&#x27;s \( e^{c^2} \). So \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \).

Case 3: \( k \) is near \( n \), say \( k = n - m \) for some fixed \( m \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{n - m}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \approx \frac{1}{n} \). Then \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \right)^{n - m} \approx \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n} \approx e \). So even for \( k \) near \( n \), the term \( T_k \) is roughly \( e \).

Wait, but if \( k = n \), then \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \). So the largest term in the sum is approximately \( e \), and other terms when \( k \) is proportional to \( n \) are like \( e^{c^2} \), which for \( c &lt; 1 \), \( c^2 &lt; 1 \), so those terms are smaller than \( e \). Therefore, the term with \( k = n \) is the largest one, approximately \( e \).

However, the sum \( a_n \) has \( n \) terms, each roughly up to \( e \). So if the largest term is \( e \), and there are \( n \) terms, then maybe the sum \( a_n \) is approximately \( n \times e \), but that might be an overestimate because most terms are smaller than \( e \). Wait, but when \( k \) is about \( cn \), then \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \), and as \( c \) goes from 0 to 1, \( e^{c^2} \) goes from 1 to \( e \). So the terms increase from 1 to \( e \). So the sum might be approximated by an integral over \( c \) from 0 to 1 of \( e^{c^2} \) multiplied by \( n \), since there are \( n \) terms each spaced by \( 1/n \).

Wait, maybe we can approximate the sum by an integral. Let me consider replacing the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n T_k \) with an integral over \( k \). Let me set \( c = k/n \), so that \( k = cn \), and \( dk = n \, dc \). Then, as \( n \to \infty \), the sum becomes approximately \( n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{cn}{n^2} \right)^{cn} \, dc = n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \, dc \).

Now, \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \), similar to before. Therefore, the integral becomes \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \). But wait, that would mean \( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \), which is \( n \times \text{some constant} \). However, this contradicts the earlier thought that the largest term is \( e \), but maybe the integral accounts for all terms. Wait, but integrating \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is a constant, so the sum would be approximately \( C n \), so \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C n) = \ln C + \ln n \). Then \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln C + \ln n}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \). But I feel like this might not be correct because I approximated the sum as \( Cn \), but maybe there&#x27;s a more precise estimation needed.

Alternatively, maybe the sum \( a_n \) is dominated by its last term \( T_n \approx e \), so \( a_n \approx e \), but that seems incorrect because there are \( n \) terms each contributing at least 1, so the sum is at least \( n \). But \( e \) is much smaller than \( n \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, this must not be the case.

Wait, there&#x27;s a contradiction here. If the largest term is \( e \), but there are \( n \) terms each contributing around 1 or more, then the sum must be at least \( n \), which tends to infinity. But then, if \( a_n \) is growing without bound, the limit \( \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would be \( 1 \), since any term growing to infinity raised to the power of \( -1/n^2 \) would tend to 1. Wait, but is that necessarily the case?

Let me think. Suppose \( a_n \) grows exponentially, say \( a_n \approx e^{n} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-n /n^2} = e^{-1/n} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows polynomially, say \( a_n \approx n^c \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-c \ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows like \( e^{n^2} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-1} \). So the key is to determine the growth rate of \( a_n \).

Therefore, to compute \( L = \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), we need to know whether \( a_n \) grows exponentially, polynomially, or otherwise. The answer hinges on the asymptotic behavior of \( a_n \).

Earlier, I thought that the sum \( a_n \) could be approximated by an integral leading to \( Cn \), but that would mean \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). However, perhaps my integral approximation is missing something?

Wait, let&#x27;s reconsider the approximation for \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s take the logarithm of \( T_k \):

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Using the Taylor expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \cdots \), we can expand this as:

\( \ln T_k \approx k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \).

Therefore, exponentiating, we have:

\( T_k \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \).

So for terms where \( k \) is small compared to \( n^{4/3} \), the correction term \( \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \) is negligible, so \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For larger \( k \), the approximation might break down, but if the dominant contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \) is not too large, maybe this is okay.

Therefore, maybe \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \). Let&#x27;s analyze this sum.

Again, let&#x27;s make a substitution \( c = k/n \), so \( k = cn \), \( c \in (0, 1] \). Then, \( e^{k^2 / n^2} = e^{c^2} \). The sum becomes approximately \( \sum_{c=1/n}^{1} e^{c^2} \cdot n \, dc \), which is similar to an integral. So:

\( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \).

But the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Then, \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \), so \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

But wait, the problem is that this approximation might not capture the true behavior of \( a_n \). If \( a_n \) is indeed growing linearly, then the limit is 1. However, perhaps the actual growth of \( a_n \) is faster than linear? Let&#x27;s check for specific values.

Take \( n = 2 \):

\( a_2 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{4}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{14}{4} = 3.5 \).

For \( n = 3 \):

\( a_3 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{9}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{9}\right)^2 + \left(1 + \frac{3}{9}\right)^3 \approx 1.1111 + (1.2222)^2 + (1.3333)^3 \approx 1.1111 + 1.4938 + 2.3704 \approx 4.9753 \).

For \( n = 10 \), it&#x27;s tedious to compute, but maybe we can see the trend. As \( n \) increases, each term \( T_k \) for \( k \) up to \( n \) is increasing from 1 to approximately \( e \). However, the number of terms is increasing as well. If each term is roughly \( e^{c^2} \), then the sum is like a Riemann sum for \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \times n \), which does grow linearly with \( n \).

But let&#x27;s check for \( n = 100 \). If \( a_{100} \approx 100 \times \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \approx 100 \times 1.46265 \approx 146.265 \). If we compute \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \), since \( 1/10000 \) is a very small exponent, the result should be very close to 1. Similarly, as \( n \) increases, \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(a_n)/n^2} \approx e^{- (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 } \approx 1 - (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 \), which tends to 1.

But the problem is that maybe the initial approximation where \( T_k \approx e^{k^2/n^2} \) is too crude. Let&#x27;s re-examine the term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \).

Taking the natural logarithm:

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Expanding the logarithm as a Taylor series:

\( \ln(1 + x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots \).

Here, \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \), so:

\( \ln T_k = k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \frac{k^3}{3n^6} - \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \frac{k^4}{3n^6} - \cdots \).

Therefore, the leading term is \( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). If we exponentiate this, we get:

\( T_k = \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \).

So the correction term is \( - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \). For the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \) to be valid, we need the next term \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) to be negligible compared to 1.

So \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \ll 1 \). For \( k \leq n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) is \( \frac{n^3}{n^4} = \frac{1}{n} \), which tends to 0 as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, even for the largest \( k = n \), the correction term is \( \frac{n^3}{2n^4} = \frac{1}{2n} \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is valid for all \( k \leq n \).

Therefore, the entire sum \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \).

Now, let&#x27;s analyze this sum. Let me make a substitution \( x = k/n \), so \( k = xn \), and \( x \) ranges from \( 1/n \) to 1 in increments of \( 1/n \). Then, \( e^{k^2 /n^2} = e^{x^2} \). The sum becomes:

\( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{x^2} \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

This is a Riemann sum approximation. The sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{(k/n)^2} \cdot \frac{1}{n} \approx \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \). Therefore, multiplying by \( n \), the original sum is approximately \( n \cdot \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

But wait, the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, the sum \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Therefore, \( \ln a_n \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \).

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln n}{n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( \ln n / n^2 \) and \( \ln C / n^2 \) tend to 0. Therefore, the limit is 0, so \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), which implies \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

However, this contradicts my earlier thought that maybe there&#x27;s a term contributing more significantly. Wait, but according to this Riemann sum approximation, the sum \( a_n \) grows linearly with \( n \). Therefore, \( a_n \) ~ \( C n \), so the inverse \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) is \( (C n)^{-1/n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( C^{-1/n^2} \) and \( n^{-1/n^2} \) approach 1, since any constant raised to the power \( -1/n^2 \) tends to 1, and \( n^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \).

Therefore, according to this reasoning, the limit should be 1. However, I recall that in some similar problems, even if the sum grows linearly, the limit might not be 1 due to more precise exponential terms. But in this case, since we&#x27;re taking the \( -1/n^2 \) power, which decays to zero, any polynomial growth in \( a_n \) would lead to the limit being 1. For example, if \( a_n = n \), then \( (n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). Similarly, if \( a_n = e^{o(n^2)} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). So unless \( a_n \) has a term like \( e^{n^2} \), the limit is 1.

But according to the previous analysis, the sum \( a_n \) is approximated by \( C n \), so the limit is 1. But maybe the approximation is missing an exponential term? Let me check with a different approach.

Alternative approach: Find the dominant term in the sum \( a_n \). Since each term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \), as we established earlier, the terms increase as \( k \) increases because \( e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is an increasing function of \( k \). Therefore, the last term \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2}\right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n \approx e \). The term before the last is \( T_{n-1} = \left(1 + \frac{n - 1}{n^2}\right)^{n - 1} \approx e^{(n - 1)^2 /n^2} \approx e^{1 - 2/n + 1/n^2} \approx e \cdot e^{-2/n} \approx e (1 - 2/n) \).

So the largest terms are approaching \( e \), and the terms near \( k = n \) are approximately \( e \). However, there are about \( n \) terms, each roughly of order up to \( e \). But if most terms are much smaller than \( e \), the sum might still be dominated by the last few terms. Wait, but how much do the terms near \( k = n \) contribute?

Suppose we consider the last \( m \) terms, where \( m \) is some fixed number. Each of these terms is approximately \( e \), so their total contribution is \( m e \). The rest of the terms (there are \( n - m \) of them) are smaller. If \( m \) is fixed, then as \( n \to \infty \), the sum \( a_n \) would be \( m e + o(n) \). But if \( m \) is allowed to grow with \( n \), say \( m = \sqrt{n} \), then the contribution would be \( \sqrt{n} e \), which is still \( o(n) \). Therefore, perhaps the sum is still dominated by the bulk of the terms rather than the last few.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by the integral \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \), as before, leading to linear growth. Let me compute \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \). The integral of \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is known as the imaginary error function, but its approximate value is indeed around 1.46265. So multiplying by \( n \), \( a_n \approx 1.46265 n \).

Therefore, \( a_n \) is roughly proportional to \( n \), so \( \ln a_n \approx \ln n + \ln(1.46265) \). Then, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln n}{n^2} + \frac{\ln(1.46265)}{n^2} \), both terms go to zero. Hence, \( \ln L = 0 \implies L = 1 \).

But let&#x27;s test this with numerical examples for small \( n \):

For \( n = 1 \), \( a_1 = (1 + 1/1^2)^1 = 2 \), so \( (a_1)^{-1/1^2} = 1/2 \).

For \( n = 2 \), \( a_2 = (1 + 1/4)^1 + (1 + 2/4)^2 = 5/4 + (3/2)^2 = 5/4 + 9/4 = 14/4 = 3.5 \), so \( (3.5)^{-1/4} \approx 0.645 \).

For \( n = 3 \), \( a_3 \approx 4.9753 \), so \( (4.9753)^{-1/9} \approx e^{-\ln(4.9753)/9} \approx e^{-1.606/9} \approx e^{-0.178} \approx 0.837 \).

For \( n = 10 \), if \( a_{10} \approx 10 \times 1.46265 \approx 14.6265 \), then \( (14.6265)^{-1/100} \approx e^{-\ln(14.6265)/100} \approx e^{-2.683/100} \approx e^{-0.02683} \approx 0.9736 \).

For \( n = 100 \), \( a_{100} \approx 146.265 \), so \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \approx e^{-\ln(146.265)/10000} \approx e^{-4.986/10000} \approx e^{-0.0004986} \approx 0.9995 \).

So as \( n \) increases, \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) seems to approach 1 from below. Therefore, the numerical evidence supports the analytical conclusion that the limit is 1.

However, I need to be careful here. The numerical examples for small \( n \) are not conclusive, but as \( n \) increases, the trend is clearly approaching 1. Hence, it&#x27;s reasonable to conclude that the limit is indeed 1.

But wait, let me consider another perspective. Suppose there exists a term in the sum \( a_n \) that grows exponentially with \( n^2 \), then \( a_n \) would be dominated by that term, and \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would tend to a value less than 1. But according to our analysis, all terms \( T_k \) are at most \( e \), and their sum grows linearly. So there&#x27;s no such term here. Therefore, the conclusion remains that the limit is 1.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider the possibility that the main contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \approx \sqrt{n} \). Wait, but why would that be? For \( k = \sqrt{n} \), \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \right)^{\sqrt{n}} \approx e^{\sqrt{n}/n^{3/2}} = e^{1/n} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{n} \). So these terms are close to 1. Therefore, such terms don&#x27;t contribute significantly.

Another angle: Let&#x27;s consider using the AM-GM inequality on the terms of the sum. The geometric mean of the terms is \( \left( \prod_{k=1}^n T_k \right)^{1/n} \leq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n T_k = \frac{a_n}{n} \). But I&#x27;m not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, note that since \( a_n \geq T_n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \), and \( a_n \leq n \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = n \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx n e \). Therefore, \( e \leq a_n \leq n e \). Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):

\( (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2} \).

Compute the limits of the bounds. The upper bound \( e^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \) as \( n \to \infty \). The lower bound \( (n e)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(n e)/n^2} = e^{-(\ln n + 1)/n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \). Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the limit is 1.

This is a solid argument. Since \( a_n \) is sandwiched between \( e \) and \( n e \), both of which raised to \( -1/n^2 \) tend to 1, so the limit must be 1.

Therefore, after considering various approaches—approximating the sum by an integral, analyzing individual terms, using inequalities—it seems consistent that the limit is 1. The key realization is that \( a_n \) grows polynomially (linearly) with \( n \), and thus \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) approaches 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \), we start by analyzing the behavior of the terms in the sum \( a_n \).

1. **Approximation of Terms**:
   Each term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \) can be approximated using the expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x \) for small \( x \). This gives:
   \[
   \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \approx \frac{k}{n^2}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2}
   \]

2. **Sum Approximation**:
   The sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by considering the behavior of \( e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For large \( n \), we approximate the sum by an integral:
   \[
   a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \approx n \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc
   \]
   where \( c = k/n \). The integral \( \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc \) is a constant, leading to \( a_n \approx C n \) for some constant \( C \).

3. **Logarithm and Limit Analysis**:
   Taking the logarithm of \( a_n \):
   \[
   \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n)
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) = 0 \implies L = e^0 = 1
   \]

4. **Squeeze Theorem**:
   Using bounds for \( a_n \):
   \[
   e \leq a_n \leq n e
   \]
   Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):
   \[
   (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2}
   \]
   Both bounds approach 1 as \( n \to \infty \), confirming the limit by the squeeze theorem.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what&#x27;s given. The term \( a_n \) is a sum from \( k=1 \) to \( n \) of \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Then we need to take the inverse of \( a_n \), raise it to the power of \( 1/n^2 \), and find the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity.

Since the limit involves \( n \) in both the exponent and the sum, maybe I need to analyze the behavior of each term in the sum as \( n \) becomes very large. Then, perhaps the entire sum \( a_n \) can be approximated, and from there, we can take the limit.

Let me start by looking at the general term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). For fixed \( k \), as \( n \) becomes large, \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) becomes very small. However, since \( k \) ranges up to \( n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) is \( \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which also tends to zero as \( n \) grows. So each term in the sum is of the form \( (1 + \text{something small})^{\text{something}} \). Maybe I can use the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) when \( x \) is small. Let me check if that applies here.

If \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \) and \( y = k \), then \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). So perhaps \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \approx e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \). However, the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) is valid when \( x \) is small and \( xy \) is also small? Wait, for fixed \( k \), as \( n \to \infty \), \( x \) is small and \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \) is also small, so the approximation might work. But when \( k \) is comparable to \( n \), say \( k \approx n \), then \( xy = \frac{n^2}{n^2} = 1 \), so in that case, \( x = \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which is small, but \( xy = 1 \), so the approximation might not be so accurate. Hmm, so maybe the terms where \( k \) is small contribute \( e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \), and the terms where \( k \) is large (like near \( n \)) might need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the logarithm of \( a_n \) to turn the product into a sum? Wait, but \( a_n \) is already a sum. Taking logarithm might not help directly. However, since we have \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), taking the logarithm would turn this into \( -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \). So maybe I can compute the limit of \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), and then exponentiate the negative of that limit. Let&#x27;s see.

Let me denote \( L = \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \). Taking natural logarithm on both sides, we have:

\( \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \).

Therefore, if I can compute \( \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), then \( L = e^{- \text{that limit}} \).

So the key is to find the asymptotic behavior of \( \ln(a_n) \) as \( n \to \infty \), specifically its leading term divided by \( n^2 \).

To compute \( \ln(a_n) \), note that \( a_n \) is a sum of terms \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). The logarithm of a sum is tricky, but maybe the sum is dominated by its largest term? If that&#x27;s the case, then \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(\text{largest term}) \). Let&#x27;s check if that&#x27;s true here.

The terms in the sum \( a_n \) are \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s see how \( T_k \) behaves as \( n \to \infty \) for different ranges of \( k \).

Case 1: \( k \) is small compared to \( n \), say \( k = o(n) \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right)^k \approx 1 + o\left( \frac{k}{n} \right) \approx 1 \). So these terms are approximately 1.

Case 2: \( k \) is proportional to \( n \), say \( k = cn \) where \( c \) is a constant between 0 and 1. Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{c}{n} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c} \) as \( n \to \infty \), since \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^n \approx e^{c} \). Wait, but here the exponent is \( cn \), so \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \). Wait, actually:

Let me recall that \( \left(1 + \frac{a}{n} \right)^{bn} \approx e^{ab} \) as \( n \to \infty \). So here \( a = c \) and \( b = c \), so it&#x27;s \( e^{c^2} \). So \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \).

Case 3: \( k \) is near \( n \), say \( k = n - m \) for some fixed \( m \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{n - m}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \approx \frac{1}{n} \). Then \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \right)^{n - m} \approx \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n} \approx e \). So even for \( k \) near \( n \), the term \( T_k \) is roughly \( e \).

Wait, but if \( k = n \), then \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \). So the largest term in the sum is approximately \( e \), and other terms when \( k \) is proportional to \( n \) are like \( e^{c^2} \), which for \( c &lt; 1 \), \( c^2 &lt; 1 \), so those terms are smaller than \( e \). Therefore, the term with \( k = n \) is the largest one, approximately \( e \).

However, the sum \( a_n \) has \( n \) terms, each roughly up to \( e \). So if the largest term is \( e \), and there are \( n \) terms, then maybe the sum \( a_n \) is approximately \( n \times e \), but that might be an overestimate because most terms are smaller than \( e \). Wait, but when \( k \) is about \( cn \), then \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \), and as \( c \) goes from 0 to 1, \( e^{c^2} \) goes from 1 to \( e \). So the terms increase from 1 to \( e \). So the sum might be approximated by an integral over \( c \) from 0 to 1 of \( e^{c^2} \) multiplied by \( n \), since there are \( n \) terms each spaced by \( 1/n \).

Wait, maybe we can approximate the sum by an integral. Let me consider replacing the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n T_k \) with an integral over \( k \). Let me set \( c = k/n \), so that \( k = cn \), and \( dk = n \, dc \). Then, as \( n \to \infty \), the sum becomes approximately \( n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{cn}{n^2} \right)^{cn} \, dc = n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \, dc \).

Now, \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \), similar to before. Therefore, the integral becomes \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \). But wait, that would mean \( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \), which is \( n \times \text{some constant} \). However, this contradicts the earlier thought that the largest term is \( e \), but maybe the integral accounts for all terms. Wait, but integrating \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is a constant, so the sum would be approximately \( C n \), so \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C n) = \ln C + \ln n \). Then \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln C + \ln n}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \). But I feel like this might not be correct because I approximated the sum as \( Cn \), but maybe there&#x27;s a more precise estimation needed.

Alternatively, maybe the sum \( a_n \) is dominated by its last term \( T_n \approx e \), so \( a_n \approx e \), but that seems incorrect because there are \( n \) terms each contributing at least 1, so the sum is at least \( n \). But \( e \) is much smaller than \( n \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, this must not be the case.

Wait, there&#x27;s a contradiction here. If the largest term is \( e \), but there are \( n \) terms each contributing around 1 or more, then the sum must be at least \( n \), which tends to infinity. But then, if \( a_n \) is growing without bound, the limit \( \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would be \( 1 \), since any term growing to infinity raised to the power of \( -1/n^2 \) would tend to 1. Wait, but is that necessarily the case?

Let me think. Suppose \( a_n \) grows exponentially, say \( a_n \approx e^{n} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-n /n^2} = e^{-1/n} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows polynomially, say \( a_n \approx n^c \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-c \ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows like \( e^{n^2} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-1} \). So the key is to determine the growth rate of \( a_n \).

Therefore, to compute \( L = \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), we need to know whether \( a_n \) grows exponentially, polynomially, or otherwise. The answer hinges on the asymptotic behavior of \( a_n \).

Earlier, I thought that the sum \( a_n \) could be approximated by an integral leading to \( Cn \), but that would mean \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). However, perhaps my integral approximation is missing something?

Wait, let&#x27;s reconsider the approximation for \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s take the logarithm of \( T_k \):

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Using the Taylor expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \cdots \), we can expand this as:

\( \ln T_k \approx k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \).

Therefore, exponentiating, we have:

\( T_k \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \).

So for terms where \( k \) is small compared to \( n^{4/3} \), the correction term \( \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \) is negligible, so \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For larger \( k \), the approximation might break down, but if the dominant contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \) is not too large, maybe this is okay.

Therefore, maybe \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \). Let&#x27;s analyze this sum.

Again, let&#x27;s make a substitution \( c = k/n \), so \( k = cn \), \( c \in (0, 1] \). Then, \( e^{k^2 / n^2} = e^{c^2} \). The sum becomes approximately \( \sum_{c=1/n}^{1} e^{c^2} \cdot n \, dc \), which is similar to an integral. So:

\( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \).

But the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Then, \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \), so \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

But wait, the problem is that this approximation might not capture the true behavior of \( a_n \). If \( a_n \) is indeed growing linearly, then the limit is 1. However, perhaps the actual growth of \( a_n \) is faster than linear? Let&#x27;s check for specific values.

Take \( n = 2 \):

\( a_2 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{4}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{14}{4} = 3.5 \).

For \( n = 3 \):

\( a_3 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{9}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{9}\right)^2 + \left(1 + \frac{3}{9}\right)^3 \approx 1.1111 + (1.2222)^2 + (1.3333)^3 \approx 1.1111 + 1.4938 + 2.3704 \approx 4.9753 \).

For \( n = 10 \), it&#x27;s tedious to compute, but maybe we can see the trend. As \( n \) increases, each term \( T_k \) for \( k \) up to \( n \) is increasing from 1 to approximately \( e \). However, the number of terms is increasing as well. If each term is roughly \( e^{c^2} \), then the sum is like a Riemann sum for \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \times n \), which does grow linearly with \( n \).

But let&#x27;s check for \( n = 100 \). If \( a_{100} \approx 100 \times \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \approx 100 \times 1.46265 \approx 146.265 \). If we compute \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \), since \( 1/10000 \) is a very small exponent, the result should be very close to 1. Similarly, as \( n \) increases, \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(a_n)/n^2} \approx e^{- (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 } \approx 1 - (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 \), which tends to 1.

But the problem is that maybe the initial approximation where \( T_k \approx e^{k^2/n^2} \) is too crude. Let&#x27;s re-examine the term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \).

Taking the natural logarithm:

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Expanding the logarithm as a Taylor series:

\( \ln(1 + x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots \).

Here, \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \), so:

\( \ln T_k = k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \frac{k^3}{3n^6} - \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \frac{k^4}{3n^6} - \cdots \).

Therefore, the leading term is \( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). If we exponentiate this, we get:

\( T_k = \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \).

So the correction term is \( - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \). For the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \) to be valid, we need the next term \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) to be negligible compared to 1.

So \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \ll 1 \). For \( k \leq n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) is \( \frac{n^3}{n^4} = \frac{1}{n} \), which tends to 0 as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, even for the largest \( k = n \), the correction term is \( \frac{n^3}{2n^4} = \frac{1}{2n} \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is valid for all \( k \leq n \).

Therefore, the entire sum \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \).

Now, let&#x27;s analyze this sum. Let me make a substitution \( x = k/n \), so \( k = xn \), and \( x \) ranges from \( 1/n \) to 1 in increments of \( 1/n \). Then, \( e^{k^2 /n^2} = e^{x^2} \). The sum becomes:

\( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{x^2} \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

This is a Riemann sum approximation. The sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{(k/n)^2} \cdot \frac{1}{n} \approx \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \). Therefore, multiplying by \( n \), the original sum is approximately \( n \cdot \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

But wait, the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, the sum \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Therefore, \( \ln a_n \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \).

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln n}{n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( \ln n / n^2 \) and \( \ln C / n^2 \) tend to 0. Therefore, the limit is 0, so \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), which implies \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

However, this contradicts my earlier thought that maybe there&#x27;s a term contributing more significantly. Wait, but according to this Riemann sum approximation, the sum \( a_n \) grows linearly with \( n \). Therefore, \( a_n \) ~ \( C n \), so the inverse \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) is \( (C n)^{-1/n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( C^{-1/n^2} \) and \( n^{-1/n^2} \) approach 1, since any constant raised to the power \( -1/n^2 \) tends to 1, and \( n^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \).

Therefore, according to this reasoning, the limit should be 1. However, I recall that in some similar problems, even if the sum grows linearly, the limit might not be 1 due to more precise exponential terms. But in this case, since we&#x27;re taking the \( -1/n^2 \) power, which decays to zero, any polynomial growth in \( a_n \) would lead to the limit being 1. For example, if \( a_n = n \), then \( (n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). Similarly, if \( a_n = e^{o(n^2)} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). So unless \( a_n \) has a term like \( e^{n^2} \), the limit is 1.

But according to the previous analysis, the sum \( a_n \) is approximated by \( C n \), so the limit is 1. But maybe the approximation is missing an exponential term? Let me check with a different approach.

Alternative approach: Find the dominant term in the sum \( a_n \). Since each term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \), as we established earlier, the terms increase as \( k \) increases because \( e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is an increasing function of \( k \). Therefore, the last term \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2}\right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n \approx e \). The term before the last is \( T_{n-1} = \left(1 + \frac{n - 1}{n^2}\right)^{n - 1} \approx e^{(n - 1)^2 /n^2} \approx e^{1 - 2/n + 1/n^2} \approx e \cdot e^{-2/n} \approx e (1 - 2/n) \).

So the largest terms are approaching \( e \), and the terms near \( k = n \) are approximately \( e \). However, there are about \( n \) terms, each roughly of order up to \( e \). But if most terms are much smaller than \( e \), the sum might still be dominated by the last few terms. Wait, but how much do the terms near \( k = n \) contribute?

Suppose we consider the last \( m \) terms, where \( m \) is some fixed number. Each of these terms is approximately \( e \), so their total contribution is \( m e \). The rest of the terms (there are \( n - m \) of them) are smaller. If \( m \) is fixed, then as \( n \to \infty \), the sum \( a_n \) would be \( m e + o(n) \). But if \( m \) is allowed to grow with \( n \), say \( m = \sqrt{n} \), then the contribution would be \( \sqrt{n} e \), which is still \( o(n) \). Therefore, perhaps the sum is still dominated by the bulk of the terms rather than the last few.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by the integral \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \), as before, leading to linear growth. Let me compute \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \). The integral of \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is known as the imaginary error function, but its approximate value is indeed around 1.46265. So multiplying by \( n \), \( a_n \approx 1.46265 n \).

Therefore, \( a_n \) is roughly proportional to \( n \), so \( \ln a_n \approx \ln n + \ln(1.46265) \). Then, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln n}{n^2} + \frac{\ln(1.46265)}{n^2} \), both terms go to zero. Hence, \( \ln L = 0 \implies L = 1 \).

But let&#x27;s test this with numerical examples for small \( n \):

For \( n = 1 \), \( a_1 = (1 + 1/1^2)^1 = 2 \), so \( (a_1)^{-1/1^2} = 1/2 \).

For \( n = 2 \), \( a_2 = (1 + 1/4)^1 + (1 + 2/4)^2 = 5/4 + (3/2)^2 = 5/4 + 9/4 = 14/4 = 3.5 \), so \( (3.5)^{-1/4} \approx 0.645 \).

For \( n = 3 \), \( a_3 \approx 4.9753 \), so \( (4.9753)^{-1/9} \approx e^{-\ln(4.9753)/9} \approx e^{-1.606/9} \approx e^{-0.178} \approx 0.837 \).

For \( n = 10 \), if \( a_{10} \approx 10 \times 1.46265 \approx 14.6265 \), then \( (14.6265)^{-1/100} \approx e^{-\ln(14.6265)/100} \approx e^{-2.683/100} \approx e^{-0.02683} \approx 0.9736 \).

For \( n = 100 \), \( a_{100} \approx 146.265 \), so \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \approx e^{-\ln(146.265)/10000} \approx e^{-4.986/10000} \approx e^{-0.0004986} \approx 0.9995 \).

So as \( n \) increases, \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) seems to approach 1 from below. Therefore, the numerical evidence supports the analytical conclusion that the limit is 1.

However, I need to be careful here. The numerical examples for small \( n \) are not conclusive, but as \( n \) increases, the trend is clearly approaching 1. Hence, it&#x27;s reasonable to conclude that the limit is indeed 1.

But wait, let me consider another perspective. Suppose there exists a term in the sum \( a_n \) that grows exponentially with \( n^2 \), then \( a_n \) would be dominated by that term, and \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would tend to a value less than 1. But according to our analysis, all terms \( T_k \) are at most \( e \), and their sum grows linearly. So there&#x27;s no such term here. Therefore, the conclusion remains that the limit is 1.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider the possibility that the main contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \approx \sqrt{n} \). Wait, but why would that be? For \( k = \sqrt{n} \), \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \right)^{\sqrt{n}} \approx e^{\sqrt{n}/n^{3/2}} = e^{1/n} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{n} \). So these terms are close to 1. Therefore, such terms don&#x27;t contribute significantly.

Another angle: Let&#x27;s consider using the AM-GM inequality on the terms of the sum. The geometric mean of the terms is \( \left( \prod_{k=1}^n T_k \right)^{1/n} \leq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n T_k = \frac{a_n}{n} \). But I&#x27;m not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, note that since \( a_n \geq T_n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \), and \( a_n \leq n \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = n \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx n e \). Therefore, \( e \leq a_n \leq n e \). Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):

\( (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2} \).

Compute the limits of the bounds. The upper bound \( e^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \) as \( n \to \infty \). The lower bound \( (n e)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(n e)/n^2} = e^{-(\ln n + 1)/n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \). Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the limit is 1.

This is a solid argument. Since \( a_n \) is sandwiched between \( e \) and \( n e \), both of which raised to \( -1/n^2 \) tend to 1, so the limit must be 1.

Therefore, after considering various approaches—approximating the sum by an integral, analyzing individual terms, using inequalities—it seems consistent that the limit is 1. The key realization is that \( a_n \) grows polynomially (linearly) with \( n \), and thus \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) approaches 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \), we start by analyzing the behavior of the terms in the sum \( a_n \).

1. **Approximation of Terms**:
   Each term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \) can be approximated using the expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x \) for small \( x \). This gives:
   \[
   \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \approx \frac{k}{n^2}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2}
   \]

2. **Sum Approximation**:
   The sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by considering the behavior of \( e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For large \( n \), we approximate the sum by an integral:
   \[
   a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \approx n \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc
   \]
   where \( c = k/n \). The integral \( \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc \) is a constant, leading to \( a_n \approx C n \) for some constant \( C \).

3. **Logarithm and Limit Analysis**:
   Taking the logarithm of \( a_n \):
   \[
   \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n)
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) = 0 \implies L = e^0 = 1
   \]

4. **Squeeze Theorem**:
   Using bounds for \( a_n \):
   \[
   e \leq a_n \leq n e
   \]
   Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):
   \[
   (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2}
   \]
   Both bounds approach 1 as \( n \to \infty \), confirming the limit by the squeeze theorem.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what&#x27;s given. The term \( a_n \) is a sum from \( k=1 \) to \( n \) of \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Then we need to take the inverse of \( a_n \), raise it to the power of \( 1/n^2 \), and find the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity.

Since the limit involves \( n \) in both the exponent and the sum, maybe I need to analyze the behavior of each term in the sum as \( n \) becomes very large. Then, perhaps the entire sum \( a_n \) can be approximated, and from there, we can take the limit.

Let me start by looking at the general term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). For fixed \( k \), as \( n \) becomes large, \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) becomes very small. However, since \( k \) ranges up to \( n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) is \( \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which also tends to zero as \( n \) grows. So each term in the sum is of the form \( (1 + \text{something small})^{\text{something}} \). Maybe I can use the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) when \( x \) is small. Let me check if that applies here.

If \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \) and \( y = k \), then \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). So perhaps \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \approx e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \). However, the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) is valid when \( x \) is small and \( xy \) is also small? Wait, for fixed \( k \), as \( n \to \infty \), \( x \) is small and \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \) is also small, so the approximation might work. But when \( k \) is comparable to \( n \), say \( k \approx n \), then \( xy = \frac{n^2}{n^2} = 1 \), so in that case, \( x = \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which is small, but \( xy = 1 \), so the approximation might not be so accurate. Hmm, so maybe the terms where \( k \) is small contribute \( e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \), and the terms where \( k \) is large (like near \( n \)) might need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the logarithm of \( a_n \) to turn the product into a sum? Wait, but \( a_n \) is already a sum. Taking logarithm might not help directly. However, since we have \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), taking the logarithm would turn this into \( -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \). So maybe I can compute the limit of \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), and then exponentiate the negative of that limit. Let&#x27;s see.

Let me denote \( L = \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \). Taking natural logarithm on both sides, we have:

\( \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \).

Therefore, if I can compute \( \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), then \( L = e^{- \text{that limit}} \).

So the key is to find the asymptotic behavior of \( \ln(a_n) \) as \( n \to \infty \), specifically its leading term divided by \( n^2 \).

To compute \( \ln(a_n) \), note that \( a_n \) is a sum of terms \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). The logarithm of a sum is tricky, but maybe the sum is dominated by its largest term? If that&#x27;s the case, then \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(\text{largest term}) \). Let&#x27;s check if that&#x27;s true here.

The terms in the sum \( a_n \) are \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s see how \( T_k \) behaves as \( n \to \infty \) for different ranges of \( k \).

Case 1: \( k \) is small compared to \( n \), say \( k = o(n) \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right)^k \approx 1 + o\left( \frac{k}{n} \right) \approx 1 \). So these terms are approximately 1.

Case 2: \( k \) is proportional to \( n \), say \( k = cn \) where \( c \) is a constant between 0 and 1. Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{c}{n} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c} \) as \( n \to \infty \), since \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^n \approx e^{c} \). Wait, but here the exponent is \( cn \), so \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \). Wait, actually:

Let me recall that \( \left(1 + \frac{a}{n} \right)^{bn} \approx e^{ab} \) as \( n \to \infty \). So here \( a = c \) and \( b = c \), so it&#x27;s \( e^{c^2} \). So \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \).

Case 3: \( k \) is near \( n \), say \( k = n - m \) for some fixed \( m \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{n - m}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \approx \frac{1}{n} \). Then \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \right)^{n - m} \approx \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n} \approx e \). So even for \( k \) near \( n \), the term \( T_k \) is roughly \( e \).

Wait, but if \( k = n \), then \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \). So the largest term in the sum is approximately \( e \), and other terms when \( k \) is proportional to \( n \) are like \( e^{c^2} \), which for \( c &lt; 1 \), \( c^2 &lt; 1 \), so those terms are smaller than \( e \). Therefore, the term with \( k = n \) is the largest one, approximately \( e \).

However, the sum \( a_n \) has \( n \) terms, each roughly up to \( e \). So if the largest term is \( e \), and there are \( n \) terms, then maybe the sum \( a_n \) is approximately \( n \times e \), but that might be an overestimate because most terms are smaller than \( e \). Wait, but when \( k \) is about \( cn \), then \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \), and as \( c \) goes from 0 to 1, \( e^{c^2} \) goes from 1 to \( e \). So the terms increase from 1 to \( e \). So the sum might be approximated by an integral over \( c \) from 0 to 1 of \( e^{c^2} \) multiplied by \( n \), since there are \( n \) terms each spaced by \( 1/n \).

Wait, maybe we can approximate the sum by an integral. Let me consider replacing the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n T_k \) with an integral over \( k \). Let me set \( c = k/n \), so that \( k = cn \), and \( dk = n \, dc \). Then, as \( n \to \infty \), the sum becomes approximately \( n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{cn}{n^2} \right)^{cn} \, dc = n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \, dc \).

Now, \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \), similar to before. Therefore, the integral becomes \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \). But wait, that would mean \( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \), which is \( n \times \text{some constant} \). However, this contradicts the earlier thought that the largest term is \( e \), but maybe the integral accounts for all terms. Wait, but integrating \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is a constant, so the sum would be approximately \( C n \), so \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C n) = \ln C + \ln n \). Then \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln C + \ln n}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \). But I feel like this might not be correct because I approximated the sum as \( Cn \), but maybe there&#x27;s a more precise estimation needed.

Alternatively, maybe the sum \( a_n \) is dominated by its last term \( T_n \approx e \), so \( a_n \approx e \), but that seems incorrect because there are \( n \) terms each contributing at least 1, so the sum is at least \( n \). But \( e \) is much smaller than \( n \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, this must not be the case.

Wait, there&#x27;s a contradiction here. If the largest term is \( e \), but there are \( n \) terms each contributing around 1 or more, then the sum must be at least \( n \), which tends to infinity. But then, if \( a_n \) is growing without bound, the limit \( \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would be \( 1 \), since any term growing to infinity raised to the power of \( -1/n^2 \) would tend to 1. Wait, but is that necessarily the case?

Let me think. Suppose \( a_n \) grows exponentially, say \( a_n \approx e^{n} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-n /n^2} = e^{-1/n} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows polynomially, say \( a_n \approx n^c \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-c \ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows like \( e^{n^2} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-1} \). So the key is to determine the growth rate of \( a_n \).

Therefore, to compute \( L = \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), we need to know whether \( a_n \) grows exponentially, polynomially, or otherwise. The answer hinges on the asymptotic behavior of \( a_n \).

Earlier, I thought that the sum \( a_n \) could be approximated by an integral leading to \( Cn \), but that would mean \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). However, perhaps my integral approximation is missing something?

Wait, let&#x27;s reconsider the approximation for \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s take the logarithm of \( T_k \):

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Using the Taylor expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \cdots \), we can expand this as:

\( \ln T_k \approx k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \).

Therefore, exponentiating, we have:

\( T_k \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \).

So for terms where \( k \) is small compared to \( n^{4/3} \), the correction term \( \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \) is negligible, so \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For larger \( k \), the approximation might break down, but if the dominant contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \) is not too large, maybe this is okay.

Therefore, maybe \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \). Let&#x27;s analyze this sum.

Again, let&#x27;s make a substitution \( c = k/n \), so \( k = cn \), \( c \in (0, 1] \). Then, \( e^{k^2 / n^2} = e^{c^2} \). The sum becomes approximately \( \sum_{c=1/n}^{1} e^{c^2} \cdot n \, dc \), which is similar to an integral. So:

\( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \).

But the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Then, \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \), so \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

But wait, the problem is that this approximation might not capture the true behavior of \( a_n \). If \( a_n \) is indeed growing linearly, then the limit is 1. However, perhaps the actual growth of \( a_n \) is faster than linear? Let&#x27;s check for specific values.

Take \( n = 2 \):

\( a_2 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{4}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{14}{4} = 3.5 \).

For \( n = 3 \):

\( a_3 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{9}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{9}\right)^2 + \left(1 + \frac{3}{9}\right)^3 \approx 1.1111 + (1.2222)^2 + (1.3333)^3 \approx 1.1111 + 1.4938 + 2.3704 \approx 4.9753 \).

For \( n = 10 \), it&#x27;s tedious to compute, but maybe we can see the trend. As \( n \) increases, each term \( T_k \) for \( k \) up to \( n \) is increasing from 1 to approximately \( e \). However, the number of terms is increasing as well. If each term is roughly \( e^{c^2} \), then the sum is like a Riemann sum for \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \times n \), which does grow linearly with \( n \).

But let&#x27;s check for \( n = 100 \). If \( a_{100} \approx 100 \times \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \approx 100 \times 1.46265 \approx 146.265 \). If we compute \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \), since \( 1/10000 \) is a very small exponent, the result should be very close to 1. Similarly, as \( n \) increases, \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(a_n)/n^2} \approx e^{- (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 } \approx 1 - (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 \), which tends to 1.

But the problem is that maybe the initial approximation where \( T_k \approx e^{k^2/n^2} \) is too crude. Let&#x27;s re-examine the term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \).

Taking the natural logarithm:

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Expanding the logarithm as a Taylor series:

\( \ln(1 + x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots \).

Here, \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \), so:

\( \ln T_k = k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \frac{k^3}{3n^6} - \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \frac{k^4}{3n^6} - \cdots \).

Therefore, the leading term is \( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). If we exponentiate this, we get:

\( T_k = \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \).

So the correction term is \( - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \). For the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \) to be valid, we need the next term \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) to be negligible compared to 1.

So \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \ll 1 \). For \( k \leq n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) is \( \frac{n^3}{n^4} = \frac{1}{n} \), which tends to 0 as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, even for the largest \( k = n \), the correction term is \( \frac{n^3}{2n^4} = \frac{1}{2n} \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is valid for all \( k \leq n \).

Therefore, the entire sum \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \).

Now, let&#x27;s analyze this sum. Let me make a substitution \( x = k/n \), so \( k = xn \), and \( x \) ranges from \( 1/n \) to 1 in increments of \( 1/n \). Then, \( e^{k^2 /n^2} = e^{x^2} \). The sum becomes:

\( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{x^2} \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

This is a Riemann sum approximation. The sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{(k/n)^2} \cdot \frac{1}{n} \approx \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \). Therefore, multiplying by \( n \), the original sum is approximately \( n \cdot \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

But wait, the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, the sum \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Therefore, \( \ln a_n \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \).

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln n}{n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( \ln n / n^2 \) and \( \ln C / n^2 \) tend to 0. Therefore, the limit is 0, so \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), which implies \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

However, this contradicts my earlier thought that maybe there&#x27;s a term contributing more significantly. Wait, but according to this Riemann sum approximation, the sum \( a_n \) grows linearly with \( n \). Therefore, \( a_n \) ~ \( C n \), so the inverse \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) is \( (C n)^{-1/n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( C^{-1/n^2} \) and \( n^{-1/n^2} \) approach 1, since any constant raised to the power \( -1/n^2 \) tends to 1, and \( n^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \).

Therefore, according to this reasoning, the limit should be 1. However, I recall that in some similar problems, even if the sum grows linearly, the limit might not be 1 due to more precise exponential terms. But in this case, since we&#x27;re taking the \( -1/n^2 \) power, which decays to zero, any polynomial growth in \( a_n \) would lead to the limit being 1. For example, if \( a_n = n \), then \( (n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). Similarly, if \( a_n = e^{o(n^2)} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). So unless \( a_n \) has a term like \( e^{n^2} \), the limit is 1.

But according to the previous analysis, the sum \( a_n \) is approximated by \( C n \), so the limit is 1. But maybe the approximation is missing an exponential term? Let me check with a different approach.

Alternative approach: Find the dominant term in the sum \( a_n \). Since each term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \), as we established earlier, the terms increase as \( k \) increases because \( e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is an increasing function of \( k \). Therefore, the last term \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2}\right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n \approx e \). The term before the last is \( T_{n-1} = \left(1 + \frac{n - 1}{n^2}\right)^{n - 1} \approx e^{(n - 1)^2 /n^2} \approx e^{1 - 2/n + 1/n^2} \approx e \cdot e^{-2/n} \approx e (1 - 2/n) \).

So the largest terms are approaching \( e \), and the terms near \( k = n \) are approximately \( e \). However, there are about \( n \) terms, each roughly of order up to \( e \). But if most terms are much smaller than \( e \), the sum might still be dominated by the last few terms. Wait, but how much do the terms near \( k = n \) contribute?

Suppose we consider the last \( m \) terms, where \( m \) is some fixed number. Each of these terms is approximately \( e \), so their total contribution is \( m e \). The rest of the terms (there are \( n - m \) of them) are smaller. If \( m \) is fixed, then as \( n \to \infty \), the sum \( a_n \) would be \( m e + o(n) \). But if \( m \) is allowed to grow with \( n \), say \( m = \sqrt{n} \), then the contribution would be \( \sqrt{n} e \), which is still \( o(n) \). Therefore, perhaps the sum is still dominated by the bulk of the terms rather than the last few.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by the integral \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \), as before, leading to linear growth. Let me compute \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \). The integral of \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is known as the imaginary error function, but its approximate value is indeed around 1.46265. So multiplying by \( n \), \( a_n \approx 1.46265 n \).

Therefore, \( a_n \) is roughly proportional to \( n \), so \( \ln a_n \approx \ln n + \ln(1.46265) \). Then, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln n}{n^2} + \frac{\ln(1.46265)}{n^2} \), both terms go to zero. Hence, \( \ln L = 0 \implies L = 1 \).

But let&#x27;s test this with numerical examples for small \( n \):

For \( n = 1 \), \( a_1 = (1 + 1/1^2)^1 = 2 \), so \( (a_1)^{-1/1^2} = 1/2 \).

For \( n = 2 \), \( a_2 = (1 + 1/4)^1 + (1 + 2/4)^2 = 5/4 + (3/2)^2 = 5/4 + 9/4 = 14/4 = 3.5 \), so \( (3.5)^{-1/4} \approx 0.645 \).

For \( n = 3 \), \( a_3 \approx 4.9753 \), so \( (4.9753)^{-1/9} \approx e^{-\ln(4.9753)/9} \approx e^{-1.606/9} \approx e^{-0.178} \approx 0.837 \).

For \( n = 10 \), if \( a_{10} \approx 10 \times 1.46265 \approx 14.6265 \), then \( (14.6265)^{-1/100} \approx e^{-\ln(14.6265)/100} \approx e^{-2.683/100} \approx e^{-0.02683} \approx 0.9736 \).

For \( n = 100 \), \( a_{100} \approx 146.265 \), so \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \approx e^{-\ln(146.265)/10000} \approx e^{-4.986/10000} \approx e^{-0.0004986} \approx 0.9995 \).

So as \( n \) increases, \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) seems to approach 1 from below. Therefore, the numerical evidence supports the analytical conclusion that the limit is 1.

However, I need to be careful here. The numerical examples for small \( n \) are not conclusive, but as \( n \) increases, the trend is clearly approaching 1. Hence, it&#x27;s reasonable to conclude that the limit is indeed 1.

But wait, let me consider another perspective. Suppose there exists a term in the sum \( a_n \) that grows exponentially with \( n^2 \), then \( a_n \) would be dominated by that term, and \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would tend to a value less than 1. But according to our analysis, all terms \( T_k \) are at most \( e \), and their sum grows linearly. So there&#x27;s no such term here. Therefore, the conclusion remains that the limit is 1.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider the possibility that the main contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \approx \sqrt{n} \). Wait, but why would that be? For \( k = \sqrt{n} \), \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \right)^{\sqrt{n}} \approx e^{\sqrt{n}/n^{3/2}} = e^{1/n} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{n} \). So these terms are close to 1. Therefore, such terms don&#x27;t contribute significantly.

Another angle: Let&#x27;s consider using the AM-GM inequality on the terms of the sum. The geometric mean of the terms is \( \left( \prod_{k=1}^n T_k \right)^{1/n} \leq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n T_k = \frac{a_n}{n} \). But I&#x27;m not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, note that since \( a_n \geq T_n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \), and \( a_n \leq n \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = n \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx n e \). Therefore, \( e \leq a_n \leq n e \). Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):

\( (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2} \).

Compute the limits of the bounds. The upper bound \( e^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \) as \( n \to \infty \). The lower bound \( (n e)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(n e)/n^2} = e^{-(\ln n + 1)/n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \). Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the limit is 1.

This is a solid argument. Since \( a_n \) is sandwiched between \( e \) and \( n e \), both of which raised to \( -1/n^2 \) tend to 1, so the limit must be 1.

Therefore, after considering various approaches—approximating the sum by an integral, analyzing individual terms, using inequalities—it seems consistent that the limit is 1. The key realization is that \( a_n \) grows polynomially (linearly) with \( n \), and thus \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) approaches 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \), we start by analyzing the behavior of the terms in the sum \( a_n \).

1. **Approximation of Terms**:
   Each term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \) can be approximated using the expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x \) for small \( x \). This gives:
   \[
   \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \approx \frac{k}{n^2}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2}
   \]

2. **Sum Approximation**:
   The sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by considering the behavior of \( e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For large \( n \), we approximate the sum by an integral:
   \[
   a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \approx n \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc
   \]
   where \( c = k/n \). The integral \( \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc \) is a constant, leading to \( a_n \approx C n \) for some constant \( C \).

3. **Logarithm and Limit Analysis**:
   Taking the logarithm of \( a_n \):
   \[
   \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n)
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) = 0 \implies L = e^0 = 1
   \]

4. **Squeeze Theorem**:
   Using bounds for \( a_n \):
   \[
   e \leq a_n \leq n e
   \]
   Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):
   \[
   (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2}
   \]
   Both bounds approach 1 as \( n \to \infty \), confirming the limit by the squeeze theorem.

Thus, the final answer is:

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what&#x27;s given. The term \( a_n \) is a sum from \( k=1 \) to \( n \) of \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Then we need to take the inverse of \( a_n \), raise it to the power of \( 1/n^2 \), and find the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity.

Since the limit involves \( n \) in both the exponent and the sum, maybe I need to analyze the behavior of each term in the sum as \( n \) becomes very large. Then, perhaps the entire sum \( a_n \) can be approximated, and from there, we can take the limit.

Let me start by looking at the general term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). For fixed \( k \), as \( n \) becomes large, \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) becomes very small. However, since \( k \) ranges up to \( n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) is \( \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which also tends to zero as \( n \) grows. So each term in the sum is of the form \( (1 + \text{something small})^{\text{something}} \). Maybe I can use the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) when \( x \) is small. Let me check if that applies here.

If \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \) and \( y = k \), then \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). So perhaps \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \approx e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \). However, the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) is valid when \( x \) is small and \( xy \) is also small? Wait, for fixed \( k \), as \( n \to \infty \), \( x \) is small and \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \) is also small, so the approximation might work. But when \( k \) is comparable to \( n \), say \( k \approx n \), then \( xy = \frac{n^2}{n^2} = 1 \), so in that case, \( x = \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which is small, but \( xy = 1 \), so the approximation might not be so accurate. Hmm, so maybe the terms where \( k \) is small contribute \( e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \), and the terms where \( k \) is large (like near \( n \)) might need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the logarithm of \( a_n \) to turn the product into a sum? Wait, but \( a_n \) is already a sum. Taking logarithm might not help directly. However, since we have \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), taking the logarithm would turn this into \( -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \). So maybe I can compute the limit of \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), and then exponentiate the negative of that limit. Let&#x27;s see.

Let me denote \( L = \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \). Taking natural logarithm on both sides, we have:

\( \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \).

Therefore, if I can compute \( \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), then \( L = e^{- \text{that limit}} \).

So the key is to find the asymptotic behavior of \( \ln(a_n) \) as \( n \to \infty \), specifically its leading term divided by \( n^2 \).

To compute \( \ln(a_n) \), note that \( a_n \) is a sum of terms \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). The logarithm of a sum is tricky, but maybe the sum is dominated by its largest term? If that&#x27;s the case, then \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(\text{largest term}) \). Let&#x27;s check if that&#x27;s true here.

The terms in the sum \( a_n \) are \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s see how \( T_k \) behaves as \( n \to \infty \) for different ranges of \( k \).

Case 1: \( k \) is small compared to \( n \), say \( k = o(n) \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right)^k \approx 1 + o\left( \frac{k}{n} \right) \approx 1 \). So these terms are approximately 1.

Case 2: \( k \) is proportional to \( n \), say \( k = cn \) where \( c \) is a constant between 0 and 1. Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{c}{n} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c} \) as \( n \to \infty \), since \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^n \approx e^{c} \). Wait, but here the exponent is \( cn \), so \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \). Wait, actually:

Let me recall that \( \left(1 + \frac{a}{n} \right)^{bn} \approx e^{ab} \) as \( n \to \infty \). So here \( a = c \) and \( b = c \), so it&#x27;s \( e^{c^2} \). So \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \).

Case 3: \( k \) is near \( n \), say \( k = n - m \) for some fixed \( m \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{n - m}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \approx \frac{1}{n} \). Then \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \right)^{n - m} \approx \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n} \approx e \). So even for \( k \) near \( n \), the term \( T_k \) is roughly \( e \).

Wait, but if \( k = n \), then \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \). So the largest term in the sum is approximately \( e \), and other terms when \( k \) is proportional to \( n \) are like \( e^{c^2} \), which for \( c &lt; 1 \), \( c^2 &lt; 1 \), so those terms are smaller than \( e \). Therefore, the term with \( k = n \) is the largest one, approximately \( e \).

However, the sum \( a_n \) has \( n \) terms, each roughly up to \( e \). So if the largest term is \( e \), and there are \( n \) terms, then maybe the sum \( a_n \) is approximately \( n \times e \), but that might be an overestimate because most terms are smaller than \( e \). Wait, but when \( k \) is about \( cn \), then \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \), and as \( c \) goes from 0 to 1, \( e^{c^2} \) goes from 1 to \( e \). So the terms increase from 1 to \( e \). So the sum might be approximated by an integral over \( c \) from 0 to 1 of \( e^{c^2} \) multiplied by \( n \), since there are \( n \) terms each spaced by \( 1/n \).

Wait, maybe we can approximate the sum by an integral. Let me consider replacing the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n T_k \) with an integral over \( k \). Let me set \( c = k/n \), so that \( k = cn \), and \( dk = n \, dc \). Then, as \( n \to \infty \), the sum becomes approximately \( n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{cn}{n^2} \right)^{cn} \, dc = n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \, dc \).

Now, \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \), similar to before. Therefore, the integral becomes \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \). But wait, that would mean \( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \), which is \( n \times \text{some constant} \). However, this contradicts the earlier thought that the largest term is \( e \), but maybe the integral accounts for all terms. Wait, but integrating \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is a constant, so the sum would be approximately \( C n \), so \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C n) = \ln C + \ln n \). Then \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln C + \ln n}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \). But I feel like this might not be correct because I approximated the sum as \( Cn \), but maybe there&#x27;s a more precise estimation needed.

Alternatively, maybe the sum \( a_n \) is dominated by its last term \( T_n \approx e \), so \( a_n \approx e \), but that seems incorrect because there are \( n \) terms each contributing at least 1, so the sum is at least \( n \). But \( e \) is much smaller than \( n \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, this must not be the case.

Wait, there&#x27;s a contradiction here. If the largest term is \( e \), but there are \( n \) terms each contributing around 1 or more, then the sum must be at least \( n \), which tends to infinity. But then, if \( a_n \) is growing without bound, the limit \( \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would be \( 1 \), since any term growing to infinity raised to the power of \( -1/n^2 \) would tend to 1. Wait, but is that necessarily the case?

Let me think. Suppose \( a_n \) grows exponentially, say \( a_n \approx e^{n} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-n /n^2} = e^{-1/n} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows polynomially, say \( a_n \approx n^c \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-c \ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows like \( e^{n^2} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-1} \). So the key is to determine the growth rate of \( a_n \).

Therefore, to compute \( L = \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), we need to know whether \( a_n \) grows exponentially, polynomially, or otherwise. The answer hinges on the asymptotic behavior of \( a_n \).

Earlier, I thought that the sum \( a_n \) could be approximated by an integral leading to \( Cn \), but that would mean \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). However, perhaps my integral approximation is missing something?

Wait, let&#x27;s reconsider the approximation for \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s take the logarithm of \( T_k \):

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Using the Taylor expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \cdots \), we can expand this as:

\( \ln T_k \approx k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \).

Therefore, exponentiating, we have:

\( T_k \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \).

So for terms where \( k \) is small compared to \( n^{4/3} \), the correction term \( \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \) is negligible, so \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For larger \( k \), the approximation might break down, but if the dominant contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \) is not too large, maybe this is okay.

Therefore, maybe \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \). Let&#x27;s analyze this sum.

Again, let&#x27;s make a substitution \( c = k/n \), so \( k = cn \), \( c \in (0, 1] \). Then, \( e^{k^2 / n^2} = e^{c^2} \). The sum becomes approximately \( \sum_{c=1/n}^{1} e^{c^2} \cdot n \, dc \), which is similar to an integral. So:

\( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \).

But the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Then, \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \), so \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

But wait, the problem is that this approximation might not capture the true behavior of \( a_n \). If \( a_n \) is indeed growing linearly, then the limit is 1. However, perhaps the actual growth of \( a_n \) is faster than linear? Let&#x27;s check for specific values.

Take \( n = 2 \):

\( a_2 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{4}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{14}{4} = 3.5 \).

For \( n = 3 \):

\( a_3 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{9}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{9}\right)^2 + \left(1 + \frac{3}{9}\right)^3 \approx 1.1111 + (1.2222)^2 + (1.3333)^3 \approx 1.1111 + 1.4938 + 2.3704 \approx 4.9753 \).

For \( n = 10 \), it&#x27;s tedious to compute, but maybe we can see the trend. As \( n \) increases, each term \( T_k \) for \( k \) up to \( n \) is increasing from 1 to approximately \( e \). However, the number of terms is increasing as well. If each term is roughly \( e^{c^2} \), then the sum is like a Riemann sum for \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \times n \), which does grow linearly with \( n \).

But let&#x27;s check for \( n = 100 \). If \( a_{100} \approx 100 \times \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \approx 100 \times 1.46265 \approx 146.265 \). If we compute \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \), since \( 1/10000 \) is a very small exponent, the result should be very close to 1. Similarly, as \( n \) increases, \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(a_n)/n^2} \approx e^{- (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 } \approx 1 - (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 \), which tends to 1.

But the problem is that maybe the initial approximation where \( T_k \approx e^{k^2/n^2} \) is too crude. Let&#x27;s re-examine the term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \).

Taking the natural logarithm:

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Expanding the logarithm as a Taylor series:

\( \ln(1 + x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots \).

Here, \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \), so:

\( \ln T_k = k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \frac{k^3}{3n^6} - \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \frac{k^4}{3n^6} - \cdots \).

Therefore, the leading term is \( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). If we exponentiate this, we get:

\( T_k = \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \).

So the correction term is \( - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \). For the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \) to be valid, we need the next term \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) to be negligible compared to 1.

So \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \ll 1 \). For \( k \leq n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) is \( \frac{n^3}{n^4} = \frac{1}{n} \), which tends to 0 as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, even for the largest \( k = n \), the correction term is \( \frac{n^3}{2n^4} = \frac{1}{2n} \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is valid for all \( k \leq n \).

Therefore, the entire sum \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \).

Now, let&#x27;s analyze this sum. Let me make a substitution \( x = k/n \), so \( k = xn \), and \( x \) ranges from \( 1/n \) to 1 in increments of \( 1/n \). Then, \( e^{k^2 /n^2} = e^{x^2} \). The sum becomes:

\( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{x^2} \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

This is a Riemann sum approximation. The sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{(k/n)^2} \cdot \frac{1}{n} \approx \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \). Therefore, multiplying by \( n \), the original sum is approximately \( n \cdot \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

But wait, the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, the sum \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Therefore, \( \ln a_n \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \).

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln n}{n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( \ln n / n^2 \) and \( \ln C / n^2 \) tend to 0. Therefore, the limit is 0, so \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), which implies \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

However, this contradicts my earlier thought that maybe there&#x27;s a term contributing more significantly. Wait, but according to this Riemann sum approximation, the sum \( a_n \) grows linearly with \( n \). Therefore, \( a_n \) ~ \( C n \), so the inverse \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) is \( (C n)^{-1/n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( C^{-1/n^2} \) and \( n^{-1/n^2} \) approach 1, since any constant raised to the power \( -1/n^2 \) tends to 1, and \( n^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \).

Therefore, according to this reasoning, the limit should be 1. However, I recall that in some similar problems, even if the sum grows linearly, the limit might not be 1 due to more precise exponential terms. But in this case, since we&#x27;re taking the \( -1/n^2 \) power, which decays to zero, any polynomial growth in \( a_n \) would lead to the limit being 1. For example, if \( a_n = n \), then \( (n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). Similarly, if \( a_n = e^{o(n^2)} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). So unless \( a_n \) has a term like \( e^{n^2} \), the limit is 1.

But according to the previous analysis, the sum \( a_n \) is approximated by \( C n \), so the limit is 1. But maybe the approximation is missing an exponential term? Let me check with a different approach.

Alternative approach: Find the dominant term in the sum \( a_n \). Since each term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \), as we established earlier, the terms increase as \( k \) increases because \( e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is an increasing function of \( k \). Therefore, the last term \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2}\right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n \approx e \). The term before the last is \( T_{n-1} = \left(1 + \frac{n - 1}{n^2}\right)^{n - 1} \approx e^{(n - 1)^2 /n^2} \approx e^{1 - 2/n + 1/n^2} \approx e \cdot e^{-2/n} \approx e (1 - 2/n) \).

So the largest terms are approaching \( e \), and the terms near \( k = n \) are approximately \( e \). However, there are about \( n \) terms, each roughly of order up to \( e \). But if most terms are much smaller than \( e \), the sum might still be dominated by the last few terms. Wait, but how much do the terms near \( k = n \) contribute?

Suppose we consider the last \( m \) terms, where \( m \) is some fixed number. Each of these terms is approximately \( e \), so their total contribution is \( m e \). The rest of the terms (there are \( n - m \) of them) are smaller. If \( m \) is fixed, then as \( n \to \infty \), the sum \( a_n \) would be \( m e + o(n) \). But if \( m \) is allowed to grow with \( n \), say \( m = \sqrt{n} \), then the contribution would be \( \sqrt{n} e \), which is still \( o(n) \). Therefore, perhaps the sum is still dominated by the bulk of the terms rather than the last few.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by the integral \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \), as before, leading to linear growth. Let me compute \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \). The integral of \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is known as the imaginary error function, but its approximate value is indeed around 1.46265. So multiplying by \( n \), \( a_n \approx 1.46265 n \).

Therefore, \( a_n \) is roughly proportional to \( n \), so \( \ln a_n \approx \ln n + \ln(1.46265) \). Then, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln n}{n^2} + \frac{\ln(1.46265)}{n^2} \), both terms go to zero. Hence, \( \ln L = 0 \implies L = 1 \).

But let&#x27;s test this with numerical examples for small \( n \):

For \( n = 1 \), \( a_1 = (1 + 1/1^2)^1 = 2 \), so \( (a_1)^{-1/1^2} = 1/2 \).

For \( n = 2 \), \( a_2 = (1 + 1/4)^1 + (1 + 2/4)^2 = 5/4 + (3/2)^2 = 5/4 + 9/4 = 14/4 = 3.5 \), so \( (3.5)^{-1/4} \approx 0.645 \).

For \( n = 3 \), \( a_3 \approx 4.9753 \), so \( (4.9753)^{-1/9} \approx e^{-\ln(4.9753)/9} \approx e^{-1.606/9} \approx e^{-0.178} \approx 0.837 \).

For \( n = 10 \), if \( a_{10} \approx 10 \times 1.46265 \approx 14.6265 \), then \( (14.6265)^{-1/100} \approx e^{-\ln(14.6265)/100} \approx e^{-2.683/100} \approx e^{-0.02683} \approx 0.9736 \).

For \( n = 100 \), \( a_{100} \approx 146.265 \), so \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \approx e^{-\ln(146.265)/10000} \approx e^{-4.986/10000} \approx e^{-0.0004986} \approx 0.9995 \).

So as \( n \) increases, \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) seems to approach 1 from below. Therefore, the numerical evidence supports the analytical conclusion that the limit is 1.

However, I need to be careful here. The numerical examples for small \( n \) are not conclusive, but as \( n \) increases, the trend is clearly approaching 1. Hence, it&#x27;s reasonable to conclude that the limit is indeed 1.

But wait, let me consider another perspective. Suppose there exists a term in the sum \( a_n \) that grows exponentially with \( n^2 \), then \( a_n \) would be dominated by that term, and \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would tend to a value less than 1. But according to our analysis, all terms \( T_k \) are at most \( e \), and their sum grows linearly. So there&#x27;s no such term here. Therefore, the conclusion remains that the limit is 1.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider the possibility that the main contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \approx \sqrt{n} \). Wait, but why would that be? For \( k = \sqrt{n} \), \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \right)^{\sqrt{n}} \approx e^{\sqrt{n}/n^{3/2}} = e^{1/n} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{n} \). So these terms are close to 1. Therefore, such terms don&#x27;t contribute significantly.

Another angle: Let&#x27;s consider using the AM-GM inequality on the terms of the sum. The geometric mean of the terms is \( \left( \prod_{k=1}^n T_k \right)^{1/n} \leq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n T_k = \frac{a_n}{n} \). But I&#x27;m not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, note that since \( a_n \geq T_n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \), and \( a_n \leq n \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = n \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx n e \). Therefore, \( e \leq a_n \leq n e \). Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):

\( (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2} \).

Compute the limits of the bounds. The upper bound \( e^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \) as \( n \to \infty \). The lower bound \( (n e)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(n e)/n^2} = e^{-(\ln n + 1)/n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \). Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the limit is 1.

This is a solid argument. Since \( a_n \) is sandwiched between \( e \) and \( n e \), both of which raised to \( -1/n^2 \) tend to 1, so the limit must be 1.

Therefore, after considering various approaches—approximating the sum by an integral, analyzing individual terms, using inequalities—it seems consistent that the limit is 1. The key realization is that \( a_n \) grows polynomially (linearly) with \( n \), and thus \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) approaches 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \), we start by analyzing the behavior of the terms in the sum \( a_n \).

1. **Approximation of Terms**:
   Each term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \) can be approximated using the expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x \) for small \( x \). This gives:
   \[
   \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \approx \frac{k}{n^2}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2}
   \]

2. **Sum Approximation**:
   The sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by considering the behavior of \( e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For large \( n \), we approximate the sum by an integral:
   \[
   a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \approx n \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc
   \]
   where \( c = k/n \). The integral \( \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc \) is a constant, leading to \( a_n \approx C n \) for some constant \( C \).

3. **Logarithm and Limit Analysis**:
   Taking the logarithm of \( a_n \):
   \[
   \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n)
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) = 0 \implies L = e^0 = 1
   \]

4. **Squeeze Theorem**:
   Using bounds for \( a_n \):
   \[
   e \leq a_n \leq n e
   \]
   Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):
   \[
   (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2}
   \]
   Both bounds approach 1 as \( n \to \infty \), confirming the limit by the squeeze theorem.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what&#x27;s given. The term \( a_n \) is a sum from \( k=1 \) to \( n \) of \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Then we need to take the inverse of \( a_n \), raise it to the power of \( 1/n^2 \), and find the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity.

Since the limit involves \( n \) in both the exponent and the sum, maybe I need to analyze the behavior of each term in the sum as \( n \) becomes very large. Then, perhaps the entire sum \( a_n \) can be approximated, and from there, we can take the limit.

Let me start by looking at the general term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). For fixed \( k \), as \( n \) becomes large, \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) becomes very small. However, since \( k \) ranges up to \( n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) is \( \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which also tends to zero as \( n \) grows. So each term in the sum is of the form \( (1 + \text{something small})^{\text{something}} \). Maybe I can use the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) when \( x \) is small. Let me check if that applies here.

If \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \) and \( y = k \), then \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). So perhaps \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \approx e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \). However, the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) is valid when \( x \) is small and \( xy \) is also small? Wait, for fixed \( k \), as \( n \to \infty \), \( x \) is small and \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \) is also small, so the approximation might work. But when \( k \) is comparable to \( n \), say \( k \approx n \), then \( xy = \frac{n^2}{n^2} = 1 \), so in that case, \( x = \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which is small, but \( xy = 1 \), so the approximation might not be so accurate. Hmm, so maybe the terms where \( k \) is small contribute \( e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \), and the terms where \( k \) is large (like near \( n \)) might need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the logarithm of \( a_n \) to turn the product into a sum? Wait, but \( a_n \) is already a sum. Taking logarithm might not help directly. However, since we have \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), taking the logarithm would turn this into \( -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \). So maybe I can compute the limit of \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), and then exponentiate the negative of that limit. Let&#x27;s see.

Let me denote \( L = \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \). Taking natural logarithm on both sides, we have:

\( \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \).

Therefore, if I can compute \( \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), then \( L = e^{- \text{that limit}} \).

So the key is to find the asymptotic behavior of \( \ln(a_n) \) as \( n \to \infty \), specifically its leading term divided by \( n^2 \).

To compute \( \ln(a_n) \), note that \( a_n \) is a sum of terms \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). The logarithm of a sum is tricky, but maybe the sum is dominated by its largest term? If that&#x27;s the case, then \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(\text{largest term}) \). Let&#x27;s check if that&#x27;s true here.

The terms in the sum \( a_n \) are \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s see how \( T_k \) behaves as \( n \to \infty \) for different ranges of \( k \).

Case 1: \( k \) is small compared to \( n \), say \( k = o(n) \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right)^k \approx 1 + o\left( \frac{k}{n} \right) \approx 1 \). So these terms are approximately 1.

Case 2: \( k \) is proportional to \( n \), say \( k = cn \) where \( c \) is a constant between 0 and 1. Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{c}{n} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c} \) as \( n \to \infty \), since \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^n \approx e^{c} \). Wait, but here the exponent is \( cn \), so \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \). Wait, actually:

Let me recall that \( \left(1 + \frac{a}{n} \right)^{bn} \approx e^{ab} \) as \( n \to \infty \). So here \( a = c \) and \( b = c \), so it&#x27;s \( e^{c^2} \). So \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \).

Case 3: \( k \) is near \( n \), say \( k = n - m \) for some fixed \( m \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{n - m}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \approx \frac{1}{n} \). Then \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \right)^{n - m} \approx \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n} \approx e \). So even for \( k \) near \( n \), the term \( T_k \) is roughly \( e \).

Wait, but if \( k = n \), then \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \). So the largest term in the sum is approximately \( e \), and other terms when \( k \) is proportional to \( n \) are like \( e^{c^2} \), which for \( c &lt; 1 \), \( c^2 &lt; 1 \), so those terms are smaller than \( e \). Therefore, the term with \( k = n \) is the largest one, approximately \( e \).

However, the sum \( a_n \) has \( n \) terms, each roughly up to \( e \). So if the largest term is \( e \), and there are \( n \) terms, then maybe the sum \( a_n \) is approximately \( n \times e \), but that might be an overestimate because most terms are smaller than \( e \). Wait, but when \( k \) is about \( cn \), then \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \), and as \( c \) goes from 0 to 1, \( e^{c^2} \) goes from 1 to \( e \). So the terms increase from 1 to \( e \). So the sum might be approximated by an integral over \( c \) from 0 to 1 of \( e^{c^2} \) multiplied by \( n \), since there are \( n \) terms each spaced by \( 1/n \).

Wait, maybe we can approximate the sum by an integral. Let me consider replacing the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n T_k \) with an integral over \( k \). Let me set \( c = k/n \), so that \( k = cn \), and \( dk = n \, dc \). Then, as \( n \to \infty \), the sum becomes approximately \( n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{cn}{n^2} \right)^{cn} \, dc = n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \, dc \).

Now, \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \), similar to before. Therefore, the integral becomes \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \). But wait, that would mean \( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \), which is \( n \times \text{some constant} \). However, this contradicts the earlier thought that the largest term is \( e \), but maybe the integral accounts for all terms. Wait, but integrating \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is a constant, so the sum would be approximately \( C n \), so \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C n) = \ln C + \ln n \). Then \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln C + \ln n}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \). But I feel like this might not be correct because I approximated the sum as \( Cn \), but maybe there&#x27;s a more precise estimation needed.

Alternatively, maybe the sum \( a_n \) is dominated by its last term \( T_n \approx e \), so \( a_n \approx e \), but that seems incorrect because there are \( n \) terms each contributing at least 1, so the sum is at least \( n \). But \( e \) is much smaller than \( n \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, this must not be the case.

Wait, there&#x27;s a contradiction here. If the largest term is \( e \), but there are \( n \) terms each contributing around 1 or more, then the sum must be at least \( n \), which tends to infinity. But then, if \( a_n \) is growing without bound, the limit \( \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would be \( 1 \), since any term growing to infinity raised to the power of \( -1/n^2 \) would tend to 1. Wait, but is that necessarily the case?

Let me think. Suppose \( a_n \) grows exponentially, say \( a_n \approx e^{n} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-n /n^2} = e^{-1/n} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows polynomially, say \( a_n \approx n^c \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-c \ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows like \( e^{n^2} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-1} \). So the key is to determine the growth rate of \( a_n \).

Therefore, to compute \( L = \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), we need to know whether \( a_n \) grows exponentially, polynomially, or otherwise. The answer hinges on the asymptotic behavior of \( a_n \).

Earlier, I thought that the sum \( a_n \) could be approximated by an integral leading to \( Cn \), but that would mean \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). However, perhaps my integral approximation is missing something?

Wait, let&#x27;s reconsider the approximation for \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s take the logarithm of \( T_k \):

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Using the Taylor expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \cdots \), we can expand this as:

\( \ln T_k \approx k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \).

Therefore, exponentiating, we have:

\( T_k \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \).

So for terms where \( k \) is small compared to \( n^{4/3} \), the correction term \( \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \) is negligible, so \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For larger \( k \), the approximation might break down, but if the dominant contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \) is not too large, maybe this is okay.

Therefore, maybe \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \). Let&#x27;s analyze this sum.

Again, let&#x27;s make a substitution \( c = k/n \), so \( k = cn \), \( c \in (0, 1] \). Then, \( e^{k^2 / n^2} = e^{c^2} \). The sum becomes approximately \( \sum_{c=1/n}^{1} e^{c^2} \cdot n \, dc \), which is similar to an integral. So:

\( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \).

But the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Then, \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \), so \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

But wait, the problem is that this approximation might not capture the true behavior of \( a_n \). If \( a_n \) is indeed growing linearly, then the limit is 1. However, perhaps the actual growth of \( a_n \) is faster than linear? Let&#x27;s check for specific values.

Take \( n = 2 \):

\( a_2 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{4}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{14}{4} = 3.5 \).

For \( n = 3 \):

\( a_3 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{9}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{9}\right)^2 + \left(1 + \frac{3}{9}\right)^3 \approx 1.1111 + (1.2222)^2 + (1.3333)^3 \approx 1.1111 + 1.4938 + 2.3704 \approx 4.9753 \).

For \( n = 10 \), it&#x27;s tedious to compute, but maybe we can see the trend. As \( n \) increases, each term \( T_k \) for \( k \) up to \( n \) is increasing from 1 to approximately \( e \). However, the number of terms is increasing as well. If each term is roughly \( e^{c^2} \), then the sum is like a Riemann sum for \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \times n \), which does grow linearly with \( n \).

But let&#x27;s check for \( n = 100 \). If \( a_{100} \approx 100 \times \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \approx 100 \times 1.46265 \approx 146.265 \). If we compute \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \), since \( 1/10000 \) is a very small exponent, the result should be very close to 1. Similarly, as \( n \) increases, \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(a_n)/n^2} \approx e^{- (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 } \approx 1 - (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 \), which tends to 1.

But the problem is that maybe the initial approximation where \( T_k \approx e^{k^2/n^2} \) is too crude. Let&#x27;s re-examine the term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \).

Taking the natural logarithm:

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Expanding the logarithm as a Taylor series:

\( \ln(1 + x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots \).

Here, \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \), so:

\( \ln T_k = k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \frac{k^3}{3n^6} - \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \frac{k^4}{3n^6} - \cdots \).

Therefore, the leading term is \( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). If we exponentiate this, we get:

\( T_k = \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \).

So the correction term is \( - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \). For the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \) to be valid, we need the next term \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) to be negligible compared to 1.

So \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \ll 1 \). For \( k \leq n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) is \( \frac{n^3}{n^4} = \frac{1}{n} \), which tends to 0 as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, even for the largest \( k = n \), the correction term is \( \frac{n^3}{2n^4} = \frac{1}{2n} \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is valid for all \( k \leq n \).

Therefore, the entire sum \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \).

Now, let&#x27;s analyze this sum. Let me make a substitution \( x = k/n \), so \( k = xn \), and \( x \) ranges from \( 1/n \) to 1 in increments of \( 1/n \). Then, \( e^{k^2 /n^2} = e^{x^2} \). The sum becomes:

\( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{x^2} \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

This is a Riemann sum approximation. The sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{(k/n)^2} \cdot \frac{1}{n} \approx \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \). Therefore, multiplying by \( n \), the original sum is approximately \( n \cdot \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

But wait, the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, the sum \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Therefore, \( \ln a_n \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \).

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln n}{n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( \ln n / n^2 \) and \( \ln C / n^2 \) tend to 0. Therefore, the limit is 0, so \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), which implies \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

However, this contradicts my earlier thought that maybe there&#x27;s a term contributing more significantly. Wait, but according to this Riemann sum approximation, the sum \( a_n \) grows linearly with \( n \). Therefore, \( a_n \) ~ \( C n \), so the inverse \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) is \( (C n)^{-1/n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( C^{-1/n^2} \) and \( n^{-1/n^2} \) approach 1, since any constant raised to the power \( -1/n^2 \) tends to 1, and \( n^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \).

Therefore, according to this reasoning, the limit should be 1. However, I recall that in some similar problems, even if the sum grows linearly, the limit might not be 1 due to more precise exponential terms. But in this case, since we&#x27;re taking the \( -1/n^2 \) power, which decays to zero, any polynomial growth in \( a_n \) would lead to the limit being 1. For example, if \( a_n = n \), then \( (n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). Similarly, if \( a_n = e^{o(n^2)} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). So unless \( a_n \) has a term like \( e^{n^2} \), the limit is 1.

But according to the previous analysis, the sum \( a_n \) is approximated by \( C n \), so the limit is 1. But maybe the approximation is missing an exponential term? Let me check with a different approach.

Alternative approach: Find the dominant term in the sum \( a_n \). Since each term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \), as we established earlier, the terms increase as \( k \) increases because \( e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is an increasing function of \( k \). Therefore, the last term \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2}\right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n \approx e \). The term before the last is \( T_{n-1} = \left(1 + \frac{n - 1}{n^2}\right)^{n - 1} \approx e^{(n - 1)^2 /n^2} \approx e^{1 - 2/n + 1/n^2} \approx e \cdot e^{-2/n} \approx e (1 - 2/n) \).

So the largest terms are approaching \( e \), and the terms near \( k = n \) are approximately \( e \). However, there are about \( n \) terms, each roughly of order up to \( e \). But if most terms are much smaller than \( e \), the sum might still be dominated by the last few terms. Wait, but how much do the terms near \( k = n \) contribute?

Suppose we consider the last \( m \) terms, where \( m \) is some fixed number. Each of these terms is approximately \( e \), so their total contribution is \( m e \). The rest of the terms (there are \( n - m \) of them) are smaller. If \( m \) is fixed, then as \( n \to \infty \), the sum \( a_n \) would be \( m e + o(n) \). But if \( m \) is allowed to grow with \( n \), say \( m = \sqrt{n} \), then the contribution would be \( \sqrt{n} e \), which is still \( o(n) \). Therefore, perhaps the sum is still dominated by the bulk of the terms rather than the last few.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by the integral \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \), as before, leading to linear growth. Let me compute \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \). The integral of \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is known as the imaginary error function, but its approximate value is indeed around 1.46265. So multiplying by \( n \), \( a_n \approx 1.46265 n \).

Therefore, \( a_n \) is roughly proportional to \( n \), so \( \ln a_n \approx \ln n + \ln(1.46265) \). Then, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln n}{n^2} + \frac{\ln(1.46265)}{n^2} \), both terms go to zero. Hence, \( \ln L = 0 \implies L = 1 \).

But let&#x27;s test this with numerical examples for small \( n \):

For \( n = 1 \), \( a_1 = (1 + 1/1^2)^1 = 2 \), so \( (a_1)^{-1/1^2} = 1/2 \).

For \( n = 2 \), \( a_2 = (1 + 1/4)^1 + (1 + 2/4)^2 = 5/4 + (3/2)^2 = 5/4 + 9/4 = 14/4 = 3.5 \), so \( (3.5)^{-1/4} \approx 0.645 \).

For \( n = 3 \), \( a_3 \approx 4.9753 \), so \( (4.9753)^{-1/9} \approx e^{-\ln(4.9753)/9} \approx e^{-1.606/9} \approx e^{-0.178} \approx 0.837 \).

For \( n = 10 \), if \( a_{10} \approx 10 \times 1.46265 \approx 14.6265 \), then \( (14.6265)^{-1/100} \approx e^{-\ln(14.6265)/100} \approx e^{-2.683/100} \approx e^{-0.02683} \approx 0.9736 \).

For \( n = 100 \), \( a_{100} \approx 146.265 \), so \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \approx e^{-\ln(146.265)/10000} \approx e^{-4.986/10000} \approx e^{-0.0004986} \approx 0.9995 \).

So as \( n \) increases, \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) seems to approach 1 from below. Therefore, the numerical evidence supports the analytical conclusion that the limit is 1.

However, I need to be careful here. The numerical examples for small \( n \) are not conclusive, but as \( n \) increases, the trend is clearly approaching 1. Hence, it&#x27;s reasonable to conclude that the limit is indeed 1.

But wait, let me consider another perspective. Suppose there exists a term in the sum \( a_n \) that grows exponentially with \( n^2 \), then \( a_n \) would be dominated by that term, and \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would tend to a value less than 1. But according to our analysis, all terms \( T_k \) are at most \( e \), and their sum grows linearly. So there&#x27;s no such term here. Therefore, the conclusion remains that the limit is 1.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider the possibility that the main contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \approx \sqrt{n} \). Wait, but why would that be? For \( k = \sqrt{n} \), \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \right)^{\sqrt{n}} \approx e^{\sqrt{n}/n^{3/2}} = e^{1/n} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{n} \). So these terms are close to 1. Therefore, such terms don&#x27;t contribute significantly.

Another angle: Let&#x27;s consider using the AM-GM inequality on the terms of the sum. The geometric mean of the terms is \( \left( \prod_{k=1}^n T_k \right)^{1/n} \leq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n T_k = \frac{a_n}{n} \). But I&#x27;m not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, note that since \( a_n \geq T_n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \), and \( a_n \leq n \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = n \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx n e \). Therefore, \( e \leq a_n \leq n e \). Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):

\( (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2} \).

Compute the limits of the bounds. The upper bound \( e^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \) as \( n \to \infty \). The lower bound \( (n e)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(n e)/n^2} = e^{-(\ln n + 1)/n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \). Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the limit is 1.

This is a solid argument. Since \( a_n \) is sandwiched between \( e \) and \( n e \), both of which raised to \( -1/n^2 \) tend to 1, so the limit must be 1.

Therefore, after considering various approaches—approximating the sum by an integral, analyzing individual terms, using inequalities—it seems consistent that the limit is 1. The key realization is that \( a_n \) grows polynomially (linearly) with \( n \), and thus \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) approaches 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \), we start by analyzing the behavior of the terms in the sum \( a_n \).

1. **Approximation of Terms**:
   Each term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \) can be approximated using the expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x \) for small \( x \). This gives:
   \[
   \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \approx \frac{k}{n^2}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2}
   \]

2. **Sum Approximation**:
   The sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by considering the behavior of \( e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For large \( n \), we approximate the sum by an integral:
   \[
   a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \approx n \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc
   \]
   where \( c = k/n \). The integral \( \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc \) is a constant, leading to \( a_n \approx C n \) for some constant \( C \).

3. **Logarithm and Limit Analysis**:
   Taking the logarithm of \( a_n \):
   \[
   \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n)
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) = 0 \implies L = e^0 = 1
   \]

4. **Squeeze Theorem**:
   Using bounds for \( a_n \):
   \[
   e \leq a_n \leq n e
   \]
   Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):
   \[
   (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2}
   \]
   Both bounds approach 1 as \( n \to \infty \), confirming the limit by the squeeze theorem.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[

## Strategy guide

1. Draw a shaded area that represents the whole problem.
2. Decide on an approximately reasonable value for the variable of interest to use in your calculation/estimate. Write this value inside a \boxed{} enclosure. The \boxed{} is a little taller than usual so you can see it on the cropped answer page.
3. Place a pen at the top left corner of your answer sheet, starting on the vertical center line of the paper. Using the bottom-right corner as your reference point, begin drawing (on pale blue eraseable grid) the calculation that leads to the value written inside \boxed{}.
4. Tackle questions 1 and 10 last. They involve algebra. You may be asked to break an algebraic expression down into multiple steps before you find the answer.
5. Beware of Conditionals. Many people new to the test make the mistake of assuming they need to follow the unconventional sequence of steps which the test provides on the answer sheet. These will be referred to as &quot;Conditionals&quot;. They&#x27;re there for a reason: they help you see whether you have come out of the Calculation/Estimation phase with the value predicted by the Conditional response. If you haven&#x27;t then there may be an opportunity to be a little more precise with your next step.

Experienced writers are always on the lookout for shortcuts. On more straightforward questions it&#x27;s OK to open a Short Cut box in your calculation. A Shortcut is an implied assumption (expressed as a barren box) that you can make a certain kind of leap of information, e.g. that some algebraic expression is approximately zero to a precision of a few hundred or thousandths.

### A word about use of calculators

Including the use of Simplifying Expressions, the test is unique (at least in its current form) among competitive Mathematics examinations, not to mention competitive USA mathematics Olympiad-style calculation tests, by being the only competition whose questions (and responses!) are formulated in units.

This rule implies that getting it wrong on a Calculations/Estimation question may well be indicative of a lack of skill with converting units (and not with answering the question itself). Consequently most maths and science Olympiads require you to understand units. So this is also true of USA Mathematics Olympiad-style calculation tests, just like for USAMOs. However the Scientific Calculator package (Windows calculator with csc, cot, sec functions) matters less here, because of the substantial input you provide with your Calculation/Estimation (context-free ability to use any real number as the basis of a calculation).

The one thing the packaged calculator does matter for is converting values: in particular the fact that the calculator&#x27;s scientific notation slips &quot;over to the left&quot; by one portion of order for every unit of &quot;incompatibility&quot; between the units of the quantity being converted and the implied units of SI base unit (what is done with scientific notation converts your value from one set of base units to the other), whereas the scientific calculator automatically rounds scientific notation to 10-precision so that you can use the addition form of scientific notation&#x27;s rules. Once these inconsistencies with your calculations are behind you you select the right expression to match the tolerances of the calculator.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what&#x27;s given. The term \( a_n \) is a sum from \( k=1 \) to \( n \) of \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Then we need to take the inverse of \( a_n \), raise it to the power of \( 1/n^2 \), and find the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity.

Since the limit involves \( n \) in both the exponent and the sum, maybe I need to analyze the behavior of each term in the sum as \( n \) becomes very large. Then, perhaps the entire sum \( a_n \) can be approximated, and from there, we can take the limit.

Let me start by looking at the general term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). For fixed \( k \), as \( n \) becomes large, \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) becomes very small. However, since \( k \) ranges up to \( n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) is \( \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which also tends to zero as \( n \) grows. So each term in the sum is of the form \( (1 + \text{something small})^{\text{something}} \). Maybe I can use the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) when \( x \) is small. Let me check if that applies here.

If \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \) and \( y = k \), then \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). So perhaps \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \approx e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \). However, the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) is valid when \( x \) is small and \( xy \) is also small? Wait, for fixed \( k \), as \( n \to \infty \), \( x \) is small and \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \) is also small, so the approximation might work. But when \( k \) is comparable to \( n \), say \( k \approx n \), then \( xy = \frac{n^2}{n^2} = 1 \), so in that case, \( x = \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which is small, but \( xy = 1 \), so the approximation might not be so accurate. Hmm, so maybe the terms where \( k \) is small contribute \( e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \), and the terms where \( k \) is large (like near \( n \)) might need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the logarithm of \( a_n \) to turn the product into a sum? Wait, but \( a_n \) is already a sum. Taking logarithm might not help directly. However, since we have \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), taking the logarithm would turn this into \( -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \). So maybe I can compute the limit of \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), and then exponentiate the negative of that limit. Let&#x27;s see.

Let me denote \( L = \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \). Taking natural logarithm on both sides, we have:

\( \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \).

Therefore, if I can compute \( \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), then \( L = e^{- \text{that limit}} \).

So the key is to find the asymptotic behavior of \( \ln(a_n) \) as \( n \to \infty \), specifically its leading term divided by \( n^2 \).

To compute \( \ln(a_n) \), note that \( a_n \) is a sum of terms \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). The logarithm of a sum is tricky, but maybe the sum is dominated by its largest term? If that&#x27;s the case, then \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(\text{largest term}) \). Let&#x27;s check if that&#x27;s true here.

The terms in the sum \( a_n \) are \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s see how \( T_k \) behaves as \( n \to \infty \) for different ranges of \( k \).

Case 1: \( k \) is small compared to \( n \), say \( k = o(n) \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right)^k \approx 1 + o\left( \frac{k}{n} \right) \approx 1 \). So these terms are approximately 1.

Case 2: \( k \) is proportional to \( n \), say \( k = cn \) where \( c \) is a constant between 0 and 1. Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{c}{n} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c} \) as \( n \to \infty \), since \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^n \approx e^{c} \). Wait, but here the exponent is \( cn \), so \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \). Wait, actually:

Let me recall that \( \left(1 + \frac{a}{n} \right)^{bn} \approx e^{ab} \) as \( n \to \infty \). So here \( a = c \) and \( b = c \), so it&#x27;s \( e^{c^2} \). So \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \).

Case 3: \( k \) is near \( n \), say \( k = n - m \) for some fixed \( m \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{n - m}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \approx \frac{1}{n} \). Then \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \right)^{n - m} \approx \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n} \approx e \). So even for \( k \) near \( n \), the term \( T_k \) is roughly \( e \).

Wait, but if \( k = n \), then \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \). So the largest term in the sum is approximately \( e \), and other terms when \( k \) is proportional to \( n \) are like \( e^{c^2} \), which for \( c &lt; 1 \), \( c^2 &lt; 1 \), so those terms are smaller than \( e \). Therefore, the term with \( k = n \) is the largest one, approximately \( e \).

However, the sum \( a_n \) has \( n \) terms, each roughly up to \( e \). So if the largest term is \( e \), and there are \( n \) terms, then maybe the sum \( a_n \) is approximately \( n \times e \), but that might be an overestimate because most terms are smaller than \( e \). Wait, but when \( k \) is about \( cn \), then \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \), and as \( c \) goes from 0 to 1, \( e^{c^2} \) goes from 1 to \( e \). So the terms increase from 1 to \( e \). So the sum might be approximated by an integral over \( c \) from 0 to 1 of \( e^{c^2} \) multiplied by \( n \), since there are \( n \) terms each spaced by \( 1/n \).

Wait, maybe we can approximate the sum by an integral. Let me consider replacing the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n T_k \) with an integral over \( k \). Let me set \( c = k/n \), so that \( k = cn \), and \( dk = n \, dc \). Then, as \( n \to \infty \), the sum becomes approximately \( n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{cn}{n^2} \right)^{cn} \, dc = n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \, dc \).

Now, \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \), similar to before. Therefore, the integral becomes \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \). But wait, that would mean \( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \), which is \( n \times \text{some constant} \). However, this contradicts the earlier thought that the largest term is \( e \), but maybe the integral accounts for all terms. Wait, but integrating \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is a constant, so the sum would be approximately \( C n \), so \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C n) = \ln C + \ln n \). Then \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln C + \ln n}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \). But I feel like this might not be correct because I approximated the sum as \( Cn \), but maybe there&#x27;s a more precise estimation needed.

Alternatively, maybe the sum \( a_n \) is dominated by its last term \( T_n \approx e \), so \( a_n \approx e \), but that seems incorrect because there are \( n \) terms each contributing at least 1, so the sum is at least \( n \). But \( e \) is much smaller than \( n \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, this must not be the case.

Wait, there&#x27;s a contradiction here. If the largest term is \( e \), but there are \( n \) terms each contributing around 1 or more, then the sum must be at least \( n \), which tends to infinity. But then, if \( a_n \) is growing without bound, the limit \( \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would be \( 1 \), since any term growing to infinity raised to the power of \( -1/n^2 \) would tend to 1. Wait, but is that necessarily the case?

Let me think. Suppose \( a_n \) grows exponentially, say \( a_n \approx e^{n} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-n /n^2} = e^{-1/n} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows polynomially, say \( a_n \approx n^c \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-c \ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows like \( e^{n^2} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-1} \). So the key is to determine the growth rate of \( a_n \).

Therefore, to compute \( L = \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), we need to know whether \( a_n \) grows exponentially, polynomially, or otherwise. The answer hinges on the asymptotic behavior of \( a_n \).

Earlier, I thought that the sum \( a_n \) could be approximated by an integral leading to \( Cn \), but that would mean \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). However, perhaps my integral approximation is missing something?

Wait, let&#x27;s reconsider the approximation for \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s take the logarithm of \( T_k \):

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Using the Taylor expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \cdots \), we can expand this as:

\( \ln T_k \approx k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \).

Therefore, exponentiating, we have:

\( T_k \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \).

So for terms where \( k \) is small compared to \( n^{4/3} \), the correction term \( \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \) is negligible, so \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For larger \( k \), the approximation might break down, but if the dominant contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \) is not too large, maybe this is okay.

Therefore, maybe \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \). Let&#x27;s analyze this sum.

Again, let&#x27;s make a substitution \( c = k/n \), so \( k = cn \), \( c \in (0, 1] \). Then, \( e^{k^2 / n^2} = e^{c^2} \). The sum becomes approximately \( \sum_{c=1/n}^{1} e^{c^2} \cdot n \, dc \), which is similar to an integral. So:

\( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \).

But the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Then, \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \), so \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

But wait, the problem is that this approximation might not capture the true behavior of \( a_n \). If \( a_n \) is indeed growing linearly, then the limit is 1. However, perhaps the actual growth of \( a_n \) is faster than linear? Let&#x27;s check for specific values.

Take \( n = 2 \):

\( a_2 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{4}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{14}{4} = 3.5 \).

For \( n = 3 \):

\( a_3 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{9}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{9}\right)^2 + \left(1 + \frac{3}{9}\right)^3 \approx 1.1111 + (1.2222)^2 + (1.3333)^3 \approx 1.1111 + 1.4938 + 2.3704 \approx 4.9753 \).

For \( n = 10 \), it&#x27;s tedious to compute, but maybe we can see the trend. As \( n \) increases, each term \( T_k \) for \( k \) up to \( n \) is increasing from 1 to approximately \( e \). However, the number of terms is increasing as well. If each term is roughly \( e^{c^2} \), then the sum is like a Riemann sum for \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \times n \), which does grow linearly with \( n \).

But let&#x27;s check for \( n = 100 \). If \( a_{100} \approx 100 \times \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \approx 100 \times 1.46265 \approx 146.265 \). If we compute \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \), since \( 1/10000 \) is a very small exponent, the result should be very close to 1. Similarly, as \( n \) increases, \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(a_n)/n^2} \approx e^{- (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 } \approx 1 - (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 \), which tends to 1.

But the problem is that maybe the initial approximation where \( T_k \approx e^{k^2/n^2} \) is too crude. Let&#x27;s re-examine the term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \).

Taking the natural logarithm:

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Expanding the logarithm as a Taylor series:

\( \ln(1 + x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots \).

Here, \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \), so:

\( \ln T_k = k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \frac{k^3}{3n^6} - \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \frac{k^4}{3n^6} - \cdots \).

Therefore, the leading term is \( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). If we exponentiate this, we get:

\( T_k = \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \).

So the correction term is \( - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \). For the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \) to be valid, we need the next term \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) to be negligible compared to 1.

So \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \ll 1 \). For \( k \leq n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) is \( \frac{n^3}{n^4} = \frac{1}{n} \), which tends to 0 as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, even for the largest \( k = n \), the correction term is \( \frac{n^3}{2n^4} = \frac{1}{2n} \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is valid for all \( k \leq n \).

Therefore, the entire sum \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \).

Now, let&#x27;s analyze this sum. Let me make a substitution \( x = k/n \), so \( k = xn \), and \( x \) ranges from \( 1/n \) to 1 in increments of \( 1/n \). Then, \( e^{k^2 /n^2} = e^{x^2} \). The sum becomes:

\( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{x^2} \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

This is a Riemann sum approximation. The sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{(k/n)^2} \cdot \frac{1}{n} \approx \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \). Therefore, multiplying by \( n \), the original sum is approximately \( n \cdot \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

But wait, the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, the sum \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Therefore, \( \ln a_n \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \).

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln n}{n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( \ln n / n^2 \) and \( \ln C / n^2 \) tend to 0. Therefore, the limit is 0, so \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), which implies \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

However, this contradicts my earlier thought that maybe there&#x27;s a term contributing more significantly. Wait, but according to this Riemann sum approximation, the sum \( a_n \) grows linearly with \( n \). Therefore, \( a_n \) ~ \( C n \), so the inverse \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) is \( (C n)^{-1/n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( C^{-1/n^2} \) and \( n^{-1/n^2} \) approach 1, since any constant raised to the power \( -1/n^2 \) tends to 1, and \( n^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \).

Therefore, according to this reasoning, the limit should be 1. However, I recall that in some similar problems, even if the sum grows linearly, the limit might not be 1 due to more precise exponential terms. But in this case, since we&#x27;re taking the \( -1/n^2 \) power, which decays to zero, any polynomial growth in \( a_n \) would lead to the limit being 1. For example, if \( a_n = n \), then \( (n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). Similarly, if \( a_n = e^{o(n^2)} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). So unless \( a_n \) has a term like \( e^{n^2} \), the limit is 1.

But according to the previous analysis, the sum \( a_n \) is approximated by \( C n \), so the limit is 1. But maybe the approximation is missing an exponential term? Let me check with a different approach.

Alternative approach: Find the dominant term in the sum \( a_n \). Since each term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \), as we established earlier, the terms increase as \( k \) increases because \( e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is an increasing function of \( k \). Therefore, the last term \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2}\right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n \approx e \). The term before the last is \( T_{n-1} = \left(1 + \frac{n - 1}{n^2}\right)^{n - 1} \approx e^{(n - 1)^2 /n^2} \approx e^{1 - 2/n + 1/n^2} \approx e \cdot e^{-2/n} \approx e (1 - 2/n) \).

So the largest terms are approaching \( e \), and the terms near \( k = n \) are approximately \( e \). However, there are about \( n \) terms, each roughly of order up to \( e \). But if most terms are much smaller than \( e \), the sum might still be dominated by the last few terms. Wait, but how much do the terms near \( k = n \) contribute?

Suppose we consider the last \( m \) terms, where \( m \) is some fixed number. Each of these terms is approximately \( e \), so their total contribution is \( m e \). The rest of the terms (there are \( n - m \) of them) are smaller. If \( m \) is fixed, then as \( n \to \infty \), the sum \( a_n \) would be \( m e + o(n) \). But if \( m \) is allowed to grow with \( n \), say \( m = \sqrt{n} \), then the contribution would be \( \sqrt{n} e \), which is still \( o(n) \). Therefore, perhaps the sum is still dominated by the bulk of the terms rather than the last few.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by the integral \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \), as before, leading to linear growth. Let me compute \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \). The integral of \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is known as the imaginary error function, but its approximate value is indeed around 1.46265. So multiplying by \( n \), \( a_n \approx 1.46265 n \).

Therefore, \( a_n \) is roughly proportional to \( n \), so \( \ln a_n \approx \ln n + \ln(1.46265) \). Then, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln n}{n^2} + \frac{\ln(1.46265)}{n^2} \), both terms go to zero. Hence, \( \ln L = 0 \implies L = 1 \).

But let&#x27;s test this with numerical examples for small \( n \):

For \( n = 1 \), \( a_1 = (1 + 1/1^2)^1 = 2 \), so \( (a_1)^{-1/1^2} = 1/2 \).

For \( n = 2 \), \( a_2 = (1 + 1/4)^1 + (1 + 2/4)^2 = 5/4 + (3/2)^2 = 5/4 + 9/4 = 14/4 = 3.5 \), so \( (3.5)^{-1/4} \approx 0.645 \).

For \( n = 3 \), \( a_3 \approx 4.9753 \), so \( (4.9753)^{-1/9} \approx e^{-\ln(4.9753)/9} \approx e^{-1.606/9} \approx e^{-0.178} \approx 0.837 \).

For \( n = 10 \), if \( a_{10} \approx 10 \times 1.46265 \approx 14.6265 \), then \( (14.6265)^{-1/100} \approx e^{-\ln(14.6265)/100} \approx e^{-2.683/100} \approx e^{-0.02683} \approx 0.9736 \).

For \( n = 100 \), \( a_{100} \approx 146.265 \), so \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \approx e^{-\ln(146.265)/10000} \approx e^{-4.986/10000} \approx e^{-0.0004986} \approx 0.9995 \).

So as \( n \) increases, \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) seems to approach 1 from below. Therefore, the numerical evidence supports the analytical conclusion that the limit is 1.

However, I need to be careful here. The numerical examples for small \( n \) are not conclusive, but as \( n \) increases, the trend is clearly approaching 1. Hence, it&#x27;s reasonable to conclude that the limit is indeed 1.

But wait, let me consider another perspective. Suppose there exists a term in the sum \( a_n \) that grows exponentially with \( n^2 \), then \( a_n \) would be dominated by that term, and \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would tend to a value less than 1. But according to our analysis, all terms \( T_k \) are at most \( e \), and their sum grows linearly. So there&#x27;s no such term here. Therefore, the conclusion remains that the limit is 1.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider the possibility that the main contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \approx \sqrt{n} \). Wait, but why would that be? For \( k = \sqrt{n} \), \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \right)^{\sqrt{n}} \approx e^{\sqrt{n}/n^{3/2}} = e^{1/n} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{n} \). So these terms are close to 1. Therefore, such terms don&#x27;t contribute significantly.

Another angle: Let&#x27;s consider using the AM-GM inequality on the terms of the sum. The geometric mean of the terms is \( \left( \prod_{k=1}^n T_k \right)^{1/n} \leq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n T_k = \frac{a_n}{n} \). But I&#x27;m not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, note that since \( a_n \geq T_n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \), and \( a_n \leq n \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = n \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx n e \). Therefore, \( e \leq a_n \leq n e \). Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):

\( (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2} \).

Compute the limits of the bounds. The upper bound \( e^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \) as \( n \to \infty \). The lower bound \( (n e)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(n e)/n^2} = e^{-(\ln n + 1)/n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \). Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the limit is 1.

This is a solid argument. Since \( a_n \) is sandwiched between \( e \) and \( n e \), both of which raised to \( -1/n^2 \) tend to 1, so the limit must be 1.

Therefore, after considering various approaches—approximating the sum by an integral, analyzing individual terms, using inequalities—it seems consistent that the limit is 1. The key realization is that \( a_n \) grows polynomially (linearly) with \( n \), and thus \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) approaches 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \), we start by analyzing the behavior of the terms in the sum \( a_n \).

1. **Approximation of Terms**:
   Each term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \) can be approximated using the expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x \) for small \( x \). This gives:
   \[
   \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \approx \frac{k}{n^2}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2}
   \]

2. **Sum Approximation**:
   The sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by considering the behavior of \( e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For large \( n \), we approximate the sum by an integral:
   \[
   a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \approx n \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc
   \]
   where \( c = k/n \). The integral \( \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc \) is a constant, leading to \( a_n \approx C n \) for some constant \( C \).

3. **Logarithm and Limit Analysis**:
   Taking the logarithm of \( a_n \):
   \[
   \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n)
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) = 0 \implies L = e^0 = 1
   \]

4. **Squeeze Theorem**:
   Using bounds for \( a_n \):
   \[
   e \leq a_n \leq n e
   \]
   Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):
   \[
   (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2}
   \]
   Both bounds approach 1 as \( n \to \infty \), confirming the limit by the squeeze theorem.

Thus, the final answer is:

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what&#x27;s given. The term \( a_n \) is a sum from \( k=1 \) to \( n \) of \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Then we need to take the inverse of \( a_n \), raise it to the power of \( 1/n^2 \), and find the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity.

Since the limit involves \( n \) in both the exponent and the sum, maybe I need to analyze the behavior of each term in the sum as \( n \) becomes very large. Then, perhaps the entire sum \( a_n \) can be approximated, and from there, we can take the limit.

Let me start by looking at the general term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). For fixed \( k \), as \( n \) becomes large, \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) becomes very small. However, since \( k \) ranges up to \( n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) is \( \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which also tends to zero as \( n \) grows. So each term in the sum is of the form \( (1 + \text{something small})^{\text{something}} \). Maybe I can use the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) when \( x \) is small. Let me check if that applies here.

If \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \) and \( y = k \), then \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). So perhaps \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \approx e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \). However, the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) is valid when \( x \) is small and \( xy \) is also small? Wait, for fixed \( k \), as \( n \to \infty \), \( x \) is small and \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \) is also small, so the approximation might work. But when \( k \) is comparable to \( n \), say \( k \approx n \), then \( xy = \frac{n^2}{n^2} = 1 \), so in that case, \( x = \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which is small, but \( xy = 1 \), so the approximation might not be so accurate. Hmm, so maybe the terms where \( k \) is small contribute \( e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \), and the terms where \( k \) is large (like near \( n \)) might need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the logarithm of \( a_n \) to turn the product into a sum? Wait, but \( a_n \) is already a sum. Taking logarithm might not help directly. However, since we have \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), taking the logarithm would turn this into \( -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \). So maybe I can compute the limit of \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), and then exponentiate the negative of that limit. Let&#x27;s see.

Let me denote \( L = \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \). Taking natural logarithm on both sides, we have:

\( \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \).

Therefore, if I can compute \( \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), then \( L = e^{- \text{that limit}} \).

So the key is to find the asymptotic behavior of \( \ln(a_n) \) as \( n \to \infty \), specifically its leading term divided by \( n^2 \).

To compute \( \ln(a_n) \), note that \( a_n \) is a sum of terms \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). The logarithm of a sum is tricky, but maybe the sum is dominated by its largest term? If that&#x27;s the case, then \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(\text{largest term}) \). Let&#x27;s check if that&#x27;s true here.

The terms in the sum \( a_n \) are \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s see how \( T_k \) behaves as \( n \to \infty \) for different ranges of \( k \).

Case 1: \( k \) is small compared to \( n \), say \( k = o(n) \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right)^k \approx 1 + o\left( \frac{k}{n} \right) \approx 1 \). So these terms are approximately 1.

Case 2: \( k \) is proportional to \( n \), say \( k = cn \) where \( c \) is a constant between 0 and 1. Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{c}{n} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c} \) as \( n \to \infty \), since \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^n \approx e^{c} \). Wait, but here the exponent is \( cn \), so \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \). Wait, actually:

Let me recall that \( \left(1 + \frac{a}{n} \right)^{bn} \approx e^{ab} \) as \( n \to \infty \). So here \( a = c \) and \( b = c \), so it&#x27;s \( e^{c^2} \). So \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \).

Case 3: \( k \) is near \( n \), say \( k = n - m \) for some fixed \( m \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{n - m}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \approx \frac{1}{n} \). Then \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \right)^{n - m} \approx \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n} \approx e \). So even for \( k \) near \( n \), the term \( T_k \) is roughly \( e \).

Wait, but if \( k = n \), then \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \). So the largest term in the sum is approximately \( e \), and other terms when \( k \) is proportional to \( n \) are like \( e^{c^2} \), which for \( c &lt; 1 \), \( c^2 &lt; 1 \), so those terms are smaller than \( e \). Therefore, the term with \( k = n \) is the largest one, approximately \( e \).

However, the sum \( a_n \) has \( n \) terms, each roughly up to \( e \). So if the largest term is \( e \), and there are \( n \) terms, then maybe the sum \( a_n \) is approximately \( n \times e \), but that might be an overestimate because most terms are smaller than \( e \). Wait, but when \( k \) is about \( cn \), then \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \), and as \( c \) goes from 0 to 1, \( e^{c^2} \) goes from 1 to \( e \). So the terms increase from 1 to \( e \). So the sum might be approximated by an integral over \( c \) from 0 to 1 of \( e^{c^2} \) multiplied by \( n \), since there are \( n \) terms each spaced by \( 1/n \).

Wait, maybe we can approximate the sum by an integral. Let me consider replacing the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n T_k \) with an integral over \( k \). Let me set \( c = k/n \), so that \( k = cn \), and \( dk = n \, dc \). Then, as \( n \to \infty \), the sum becomes approximately \( n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{cn}{n^2} \right)^{cn} \, dc = n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \, dc \).

Now, \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \), similar to before. Therefore, the integral becomes \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \). But wait, that would mean \( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \), which is \( n \times \text{some constant} \). However, this contradicts the earlier thought that the largest term is \( e \), but maybe the integral accounts for all terms. Wait, but integrating \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is a constant, so the sum would be approximately \( C n \), so \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C n) = \ln C + \ln n \). Then \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln C + \ln n}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \). But I feel like this might not be correct because I approximated the sum as \( Cn \), but maybe there&#x27;s a more precise estimation needed.

Alternatively, maybe the sum \( a_n \) is dominated by its last term \( T_n \approx e \), so \( a_n \approx e \), but that seems incorrect because there are \( n \) terms each contributing at least 1, so the sum is at least \( n \). But \( e \) is much smaller than \( n \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, this must not be the case.

Wait, there&#x27;s a contradiction here. If the largest term is \( e \), but there are \( n \) terms each contributing around 1 or more, then the sum must be at least \( n \), which tends to infinity. But then, if \( a_n \) is growing without bound, the limit \( \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would be \( 1 \), since any term growing to infinity raised to the power of \( -1/n^2 \) would tend to 1. Wait, but is that necessarily the case?

Let me think. Suppose \( a_n \) grows exponentially, say \( a_n \approx e^{n} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-n /n^2} = e^{-1/n} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows polynomially, say \( a_n \approx n^c \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-c \ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows like \( e^{n^2} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-1} \). So the key is to determine the growth rate of \( a_n \).

Therefore, to compute \( L = \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), we need to know whether \( a_n \) grows exponentially, polynomially, or otherwise. The answer hinges on the asymptotic behavior of \( a_n \).

Earlier, I thought that the sum \( a_n \) could be approximated by an integral leading to \( Cn \), but that would mean \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). However, perhaps my integral approximation is missing something?

Wait, let&#x27;s reconsider the approximation for \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s take the logarithm of \( T_k \):

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Using the Taylor expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \cdots \), we can expand this as:

\( \ln T_k \approx k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \).

Therefore, exponentiating, we have:

\( T_k \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \).

So for terms where \( k \) is small compared to \( n^{4/3} \), the correction term \( \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \) is negligible, so \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For larger \( k \), the approximation might break down, but if the dominant contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \) is not too large, maybe this is okay.

Therefore, maybe \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \). Let&#x27;s analyze this sum.

Again, let&#x27;s make a substitution \( c = k/n \), so \( k = cn \), \( c \in (0, 1] \). Then, \( e^{k^2 / n^2} = e^{c^2} \). The sum becomes approximately \( \sum_{c=1/n}^{1} e^{c^2} \cdot n \, dc \), which is similar to an integral. So:

\( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \).

But the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Then, \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \), so \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

But wait, the problem is that this approximation might not capture the true behavior of \( a_n \). If \( a_n \) is indeed growing linearly, then the limit is 1. However, perhaps the actual growth of \( a_n \) is faster than linear? Let&#x27;s check for specific values.

Take \( n = 2 \):

\( a_2 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{4}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{14}{4} = 3.5 \).

For \( n = 3 \):

\( a_3 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{9}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{9}\right)^2 + \left(1 + \frac{3}{9}\right)^3 \approx 1.1111 + (1.2222)^2 + (1.3333)^3 \approx 1.1111 + 1.4938 + 2.3704 \approx 4.9753 \).

For \( n = 10 \), it&#x27;s tedious to compute, but maybe we can see the trend. As \( n \) increases, each term \( T_k \) for \( k \) up to \( n \) is increasing from 1 to approximately \( e \). However, the number of terms is increasing as well. If each term is roughly \( e^{c^2} \), then the sum is like a Riemann sum for \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \times n \), which does grow linearly with \( n \).

But let&#x27;s check for \( n = 100 \). If \( a_{100} \approx 100 \times \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \approx 100 \times 1.46265 \approx 146.265 \). If we compute \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \), since \( 1/10000 \) is a very small exponent, the result should be very close to 1. Similarly, as \( n \) increases, \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(a_n)/n^2} \approx e^{- (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 } \approx 1 - (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 \), which tends to 1.

But the problem is that maybe the initial approximation where \( T_k \approx e^{k^2/n^2} \) is too crude. Let&#x27;s re-examine the term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \).

Taking the natural logarithm:

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Expanding the logarithm as a Taylor series:

\( \ln(1 + x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots \).

Here, \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \), so:

\( \ln T_k = k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \frac{k^3}{3n^6} - \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \frac{k^4}{3n^6} - \cdots \).

Therefore, the leading term is \( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). If we exponentiate this, we get:

\( T_k = \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \).

So the correction term is \( - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \). For the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \) to be valid, we need the next term \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) to be negligible compared to 1.

So \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \ll 1 \). For \( k \leq n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) is \( \frac{n^3}{n^4} = \frac{1}{n} \), which tends to 0 as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, even for the largest \( k = n \), the correction term is \( \frac{n^3}{2n^4} = \frac{1}{2n} \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is valid for all \( k \leq n \).

Therefore, the entire sum \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \).

Now, let&#x27;s analyze this sum. Let me make a substitution \( x = k/n \), so \( k = xn \), and \( x \) ranges from \( 1/n \) to 1 in increments of \( 1/n \). Then, \( e^{k^2 /n^2} = e^{x^2} \). The sum becomes:

\( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{x^2} \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

This is a Riemann sum approximation. The sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{(k/n)^2} \cdot \frac{1}{n} \approx \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \). Therefore, multiplying by \( n \), the original sum is approximately \( n \cdot \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

But wait, the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, the sum \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Therefore, \( \ln a_n \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \).

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln n}{n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( \ln n / n^2 \) and \( \ln C / n^2 \) tend to 0. Therefore, the limit is 0, so \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), which implies \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

However, this contradicts my earlier thought that maybe there&#x27;s a term contributing more significantly. Wait, but according to this Riemann sum approximation, the sum \( a_n \) grows linearly with \( n \). Therefore, \( a_n \) ~ \( C n \), so the inverse \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) is \( (C n)^{-1/n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( C^{-1/n^2} \) and \( n^{-1/n^2} \) approach 1, since any constant raised to the power \( -1/n^2 \) tends to 1, and \( n^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \).

Therefore, according to this reasoning, the limit should be 1. However, I recall that in some similar problems, even if the sum grows linearly, the limit might not be 1 due to more precise exponential terms. But in this case, since we&#x27;re taking the \( -1/n^2 \) power, which decays to zero, any polynomial growth in \( a_n \) would lead to the limit being 1. For example, if \( a_n = n \), then \( (n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). Similarly, if \( a_n = e^{o(n^2)} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). So unless \( a_n \) has a term like \( e^{n^2} \), the limit is 1.

But according to the previous analysis, the sum \( a_n \) is approximated by \( C n \), so the limit is 1. But maybe the approximation is missing an exponential term? Let me check with a different approach.

Alternative approach: Find the dominant term in the sum \( a_n \). Since each term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \), as we established earlier, the terms increase as \( k \) increases because \( e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is an increasing function of \( k \). Therefore, the last term \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2}\right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n \approx e \). The term before the last is \( T_{n-1} = \left(1 + \frac{n - 1}{n^2}\right)^{n - 1} \approx e^{(n - 1)^2 /n^2} \approx e^{1 - 2/n + 1/n^2} \approx e \cdot e^{-2/n} \approx e (1 - 2/n) \).

So the largest terms are approaching \( e \), and the terms near \( k = n \) are approximately \( e \). However, there are about \( n \) terms, each roughly of order up to \( e \). But if most terms are much smaller than \( e \), the sum might still be dominated by the last few terms. Wait, but how much do the terms near \( k = n \) contribute?

Suppose we consider the last \( m \) terms, where \( m \) is some fixed number. Each of these terms is approximately \( e \), so their total contribution is \( m e \). The rest of the terms (there are \( n - m \) of them) are smaller. If \( m \) is fixed, then as \( n \to \infty \), the sum \( a_n \) would be \( m e + o(n) \). But if \( m \) is allowed to grow with \( n \), say \( m = \sqrt{n} \), then the contribution would be \( \sqrt{n} e \), which is still \( o(n) \). Therefore, perhaps the sum is still dominated by the bulk of the terms rather than the last few.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by the integral \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \), as before, leading to linear growth. Let me compute \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \). The integral of \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is known as the imaginary error function, but its approximate value is indeed around 1.46265. So multiplying by \( n \), \( a_n \approx 1.46265 n \).

Therefore, \( a_n \) is roughly proportional to \( n \), so \( \ln a_n \approx \ln n + \ln(1.46265) \). Then, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln n}{n^2} + \frac{\ln(1.46265)}{n^2} \), both terms go to zero. Hence, \( \ln L = 0 \implies L = 1 \).

But let&#x27;s test this with numerical examples for small \( n \):

For \( n = 1 \), \( a_1 = (1 + 1/1^2)^1 = 2 \), so \( (a_1)^{-1/1^2} = 1/2 \).

For \( n = 2 \), \( a_2 = (1 + 1/4)^1 + (1 + 2/4)^2 = 5/4 + (3/2)^2 = 5/4 + 9/4 = 14/4 = 3.5 \), so \( (3.5)^{-1/4} \approx 0.645 \).

For \( n = 3 \), \( a_3 \approx 4.9753 \), so \( (4.9753)^{-1/9} \approx e^{-\ln(4.9753)/9} \approx e^{-1.606/9} \approx e^{-0.178} \approx 0.837 \).

For \( n = 10 \), if \( a_{10} \approx 10 \times 1.46265 \approx 14.6265 \), then \( (14.6265)^{-1/100} \approx e^{-\ln(14.6265)/100} \approx e^{-2.683/100} \approx e^{-0.02683} \approx 0.9736 \).

For \( n = 100 \), \( a_{100} \approx 146.265 \), so \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \approx e^{-\ln(146.265)/10000} \approx e^{-4.986/10000} \approx e^{-0.0004986} \approx 0.9995 \).

So as \( n \) increases, \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) seems to approach 1 from below. Therefore, the numerical evidence supports the analytical conclusion that the limit is 1.

However, I need to be careful here. The numerical examples for small \( n \) are not conclusive, but as \( n \) increases, the trend is clearly approaching 1. Hence, it&#x27;s reasonable to conclude that the limit is indeed 1.

But wait, let me consider another perspective. Suppose there exists a term in the sum \( a_n \) that grows exponentially with \( n^2 \), then \( a_n \) would be dominated by that term, and \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would tend to a value less than 1. But according to our analysis, all terms \( T_k \) are at most \( e \), and their sum grows linearly. So there&#x27;s no such term here. Therefore, the conclusion remains that the limit is 1.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider the possibility that the main contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \approx \sqrt{n} \). Wait, but why would that be? For \( k = \sqrt{n} \), \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \right)^{\sqrt{n}} \approx e^{\sqrt{n}/n^{3/2}} = e^{1/n} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{n} \). So these terms are close to 1. Therefore, such terms don&#x27;t contribute significantly.

Another angle: Let&#x27;s consider using the AM-GM inequality on the terms of the sum. The geometric mean of the terms is \( \left( \prod_{k=1}^n T_k \right)^{1/n} \leq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n T_k = \frac{a_n}{n} \). But I&#x27;m not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, note that since \( a_n \geq T_n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \), and \( a_n \leq n \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = n \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx n e \). Therefore, \( e \leq a_n \leq n e \). Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):

\( (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2} \).

Compute the limits of the bounds. The upper bound \( e^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \) as \( n \to \infty \). The lower bound \( (n e)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(n e)/n^2} = e^{-(\ln n + 1)/n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \). Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the limit is 1.

This is a solid argument. Since \( a_n \) is sandwiched between \( e \) and \( n e \), both of which raised to \( -1/n^2 \) tend to 1, so the limit must be 1.

Therefore, after considering various approaches—approximating the sum by an integral, analyzing individual terms, using inequalities—it seems consistent that the limit is 1. The key realization is that \( a_n \) grows polynomially (linearly) with \( n \), and thus \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) approaches 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \), we start by analyzing the behavior of the terms in the sum \( a_n \).

1. **Approximation of Terms**:
   Each term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \) can be approximated using the expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x \) for small \( x \). This gives:
   \[
   \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \approx \frac{k}{n^2}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2}
   \]

2. **Sum Approximation**:
   The sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by considering the behavior of \( e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For large \( n \), we approximate the sum by an integral:
   \[
   a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \approx n \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc
   \]
   where \( c = k/n \). The integral \( \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc \) is a constant, leading to \( a_n \approx C n \) for some constant \( C \).

3. **Logarithm and Limit Analysis**:
   Taking the logarithm of \( a_n \):
   \[
   \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n)
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) = 0 \implies L = e^0 = 1
   \]

4. **Squeeze Theorem**:
   Using bounds for \( a_n \):
   \[
   e \leq a_n \leq n e
   \]
   Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):
   \[
   (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2}
   \]
   Both bounds approach 1 as \( n \to \infty \), confirming the limit by the squeeze theorem.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what&#x27;s given. The term \( a_n \) is a sum from \( k=1 \) to \( n \) of \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Then we need to take the inverse of \( a_n \), raise it to the power of \( 1/n^2 \), and find the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity.

Since the limit involves \( n \) in both the exponent and the sum, maybe I need to analyze the behavior of each term in the sum as \( n \) becomes very large. Then, perhaps the entire sum \( a_n \) can be approximated, and from there, we can take the limit.

Let me start by looking at the general term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). For fixed \( k \), as \( n \) becomes large, \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) becomes very small. However, since \( k \) ranges up to \( n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) is \( \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which also tends to zero as \( n \) grows. So each term in the sum is of the form \( (1 + \text{something small})^{\text{something}} \). Maybe I can use the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) when \( x \) is small. Let me check if that applies here.

If \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \) and \( y = k \), then \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). So perhaps \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \approx e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \). However, the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) is valid when \( x \) is small and \( xy \) is also small? Wait, for fixed \( k \), as \( n \to \infty \), \( x \) is small and \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \) is also small, so the approximation might work. But when \( k \) is comparable to \( n \), say \( k \approx n \), then \( xy = \frac{n^2}{n^2} = 1 \), so in that case, \( x = \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which is small, but \( xy = 1 \), so the approximation might not be so accurate. Hmm, so maybe the terms where \( k \) is small contribute \( e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \), and the terms where \( k \) is large (like near \( n \)) might need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the logarithm of \( a_n \) to turn the product into a sum? Wait, but \( a_n \) is already a sum. Taking logarithm might not help directly. However, since we have \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), taking the logarithm would turn this into \( -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \). So maybe I can compute the limit of \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), and then exponentiate the negative of that limit. Let&#x27;s see.

Let me denote \( L = \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \). Taking natural logarithm on both sides, we have:

\( \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \).

Therefore, if I can compute \( \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), then \( L = e^{- \text{that limit}} \).

So the key is to find the asymptotic behavior of \( \ln(a_n) \) as \( n \to \infty \), specifically its leading term divided by \( n^2 \).

To compute \( \ln(a_n) \), note that \( a_n \) is a sum of terms \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). The logarithm of a sum is tricky, but maybe the sum is dominated by its largest term? If that&#x27;s the case, then \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(\text{largest term}) \). Let&#x27;s check if that&#x27;s true here.

The terms in the sum \( a_n \) are \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s see how \( T_k \) behaves as \( n \to \infty \) for different ranges of \( k \).

Case 1: \( k \) is small compared to \( n \), say \( k = o(n) \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right)^k \approx 1 + o\left( \frac{k}{n} \right) \approx 1 \). So these terms are approximately 1.

Case 2: \( k \) is proportional to \( n \), say \( k = cn \) where \( c \) is a constant between 0 and 1. Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{c}{n} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c} \) as \( n \to \infty \), since \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^n \approx e^{c} \). Wait, but here the exponent is \( cn \), so \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \). Wait, actually:

Let me recall that \( \left(1 + \frac{a}{n} \right)^{bn} \approx e^{ab} \) as \( n \to \infty \). So here \( a = c \) and \( b = c \), so it&#x27;s \( e^{c^2} \). So \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \).

Case 3: \( k \) is near \( n \), say \( k = n - m \) for some fixed \( m \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{n - m}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \approx \frac{1}{n} \). Then \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \right)^{n - m} \approx \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n} \approx e \). So even for \( k \) near \( n \), the term \( T_k \) is roughly \( e \).

Wait, but if \( k = n \), then \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \). So the largest term in the sum is approximately \( e \), and other terms when \( k \) is proportional to \( n \) are like \( e^{c^2} \), which for \( c &lt; 1 \), \( c^2 &lt; 1 \), so those terms are smaller than \( e \). Therefore, the term with \( k = n \) is the largest one, approximately \( e \).

However, the sum \( a_n \) has \( n \) terms, each roughly up to \( e \). So if the largest term is \( e \), and there are \( n \) terms, then maybe the sum \( a_n \) is approximately \( n \times e \), but that might be an overestimate because most terms are smaller than \( e \). Wait, but when \( k \) is about \( cn \), then \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \), and as \( c \) goes from 0 to 1, \( e^{c^2} \) goes from 1 to \( e \). So the terms increase from 1 to \( e \). So the sum might be approximated by an integral over \( c \) from 0 to 1 of \( e^{c^2} \) multiplied by \( n \), since there are \( n \) terms each spaced by \( 1/n \).

Wait, maybe we can approximate the sum by an integral. Let me consider replacing the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n T_k \) with an integral over \( k \). Let me set \( c = k/n \), so that \( k = cn \), and \( dk = n \, dc \). Then, as \( n \to \infty \), the sum becomes approximately \( n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{cn}{n^2} \right)^{cn} \, dc = n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \, dc \).

Now, \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \), similar to before. Therefore, the integral becomes \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \). But wait, that would mean \( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \), which is \( n \times \text{some constant} \). However, this contradicts the earlier thought that the largest term is \( e \), but maybe the integral accounts for all terms. Wait, but integrating \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is a constant, so the sum would be approximately \( C n \), so \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C n) = \ln C + \ln n \). Then \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln C + \ln n}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \). But I feel like this might not be correct because I approximated the sum as \( Cn \), but maybe there&#x27;s a more precise estimation needed.

Alternatively, maybe the sum \( a_n \) is dominated by its last term \( T_n \approx e \), so \( a_n \approx e \), but that seems incorrect because there are \( n \) terms each contributing at least 1, so the sum is at least \( n \). But \( e \) is much smaller than \( n \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, this must not be the case.

Wait, there&#x27;s a contradiction here. If the largest term is \( e \), but there are \( n \) terms each contributing around 1 or more, then the sum must be at least \( n \), which tends to infinity. But then, if \( a_n \) is growing without bound, the limit \( \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would be \( 1 \), since any term growing to infinity raised to the power of \( -1/n^2 \) would tend to 1. Wait, but is that necessarily the case?

Let me think. Suppose \( a_n \) grows exponentially, say \( a_n \approx e^{n} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-n /n^2} = e^{-1/n} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows polynomially, say \( a_n \approx n^c \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-c \ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows like \( e^{n^2} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-1} \). So the key is to determine the growth rate of \( a_n \).

Therefore, to compute \( L = \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), we need to know whether \( a_n \) grows exponentially, polynomially, or otherwise. The answer hinges on the asymptotic behavior of \( a_n \).

Earlier, I thought that the sum \( a_n \) could be approximated by an integral leading to \( Cn \), but that would mean \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). However, perhaps my integral approximation is missing something?

Wait, let&#x27;s reconsider the approximation for \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s take the logarithm of \( T_k \):

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Using the Taylor expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \cdots \), we can expand this as:

\( \ln T_k \approx k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \).

Therefore, exponentiating, we have:

\( T_k \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \).

So for terms where \( k \) is small compared to \( n^{4/3} \), the correction term \( \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \) is negligible, so \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For larger \( k \), the approximation might break down, but if the dominant contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \) is not too large, maybe this is okay.

Therefore, maybe \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \). Let&#x27;s analyze this sum.

Again, let&#x27;s make a substitution \( c = k/n \), so \( k = cn \), \( c \in (0, 1] \). Then, \( e^{k^2 / n^2} = e^{c^2} \). The sum becomes approximately \( \sum_{c=1/n}^{1} e^{c^2} \cdot n \, dc \), which is similar to an integral. So:

\( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \).

But the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Then, \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \), so \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

But wait, the problem is that this approximation might not capture the true behavior of \( a_n \). If \( a_n \) is indeed growing linearly, then the limit is 1. However, perhaps the actual growth of \( a_n \) is faster than linear? Let&#x27;s check for specific values.

Take \( n = 2 \):

\( a_2 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{4}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{14}{4} = 3.5 \).

For \( n = 3 \):

\( a_3 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{9}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{9}\right)^2 + \left(1 + \frac{3}{9}\right)^3 \approx 1.1111 + (1.2222)^2 + (1.3333)^3 \approx 1.1111 + 1.4938 + 2.3704 \approx 4.9753 \).

For \( n = 10 \), it&#x27;s tedious to compute, but maybe we can see the trend. As \( n \) increases, each term \( T_k \) for \( k \) up to \( n \) is increasing from 1 to approximately \( e \). However, the number of terms is increasing as well. If each term is roughly \( e^{c^2} \), then the sum is like a Riemann sum for \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \times n \), which does grow linearly with \( n \).

But let&#x27;s check for \( n = 100 \). If \( a_{100} \approx 100 \times \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \approx 100 \times 1.46265 \approx 146.265 \). If we compute \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \), since \( 1/10000 \) is a very small exponent, the result should be very close to 1. Similarly, as \( n \) increases, \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(a_n)/n^2} \approx e^{- (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 } \approx 1 - (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 \), which tends to 1.

But the problem is that maybe the initial approximation where \( T_k \approx e^{k^2/n^2} \) is too crude. Let&#x27;s re-examine the term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \).

Taking the natural logarithm:

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Expanding the logarithm as a Taylor series:

\( \ln(1 + x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots \).

Here, \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \), so:

\( \ln T_k = k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \frac{k^3}{3n^6} - \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \frac{k^4}{3n^6} - \cdots \).

Therefore, the leading term is \( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). If we exponentiate this, we get:

\( T_k = \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \).

So the correction term is \( - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \). For the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \) to be valid, we need the next term \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) to be negligible compared to 1.

So \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \ll 1 \). For \( k \leq n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) is \( \frac{n^3}{n^4} = \frac{1}{n} \), which tends to 0 as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, even for the largest \( k = n \), the correction term is \( \frac{n^3}{2n^4} = \frac{1}{2n} \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is valid for all \( k \leq n \).

Therefore, the entire sum \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \).

Now, let&#x27;s analyze this sum. Let me make a substitution \( x = k/n \), so \( k = xn \), and \( x \) ranges from \( 1/n \) to 1 in increments of \( 1/n \). Then, \( e^{k^2 /n^2} = e^{x^2} \). The sum becomes:

\( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{x^2} \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

This is a Riemann sum approximation. The sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{(k/n)^2} \cdot \frac{1}{n} \approx \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \). Therefore, multiplying by \( n \), the original sum is approximately \( n \cdot \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

But wait, the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, the sum \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Therefore, \( \ln a_n \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \).

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln n}{n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( \ln n / n^2 \) and \( \ln C / n^2 \) tend to 0. Therefore, the limit is 0, so \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), which implies \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

However, this contradicts my earlier thought that maybe there&#x27;s a term contributing more significantly. Wait, but according to this Riemann sum approximation, the sum \( a_n \) grows linearly with \( n \). Therefore, \( a_n \) ~ \( C n \), so the inverse \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) is \( (C n)^{-1/n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( C^{-1/n^2} \) and \( n^{-1/n^2} \) approach 1, since any constant raised to the power \( -1/n^2 \) tends to 1, and \( n^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \).

Therefore, according to this reasoning, the limit should be 1. However, I recall that in some similar problems, even if the sum grows linearly, the limit might not be 1 due to more precise exponential terms. But in this case, since we&#x27;re taking the \( -1/n^2 \) power, which decays to zero, any polynomial growth in \( a_n \) would lead to the limit being 1. For example, if \( a_n = n \), then \( (n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). Similarly, if \( a_n = e^{o(n^2)} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). So unless \( a_n \) has a term like \( e^{n^2} \), the limit is 1.

But according to the previous analysis, the sum \( a_n \) is approximated by \( C n \), so the limit is 1. But maybe the approximation is missing an exponential term? Let me check with a different approach.

Alternative approach: Find the dominant term in the sum \( a_n \). Since each term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \), as we established earlier, the terms increase as \( k \) increases because \( e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is an increasing function of \( k \). Therefore, the last term \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2}\right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n \approx e \). The term before the last is \( T_{n-1} = \left(1 + \frac{n - 1}{n^2}\right)^{n - 1} \approx e^{(n - 1)^2 /n^2} \approx e^{1 - 2/n + 1/n^2} \approx e \cdot e^{-2/n} \approx e (1 - 2/n) \).

So the largest terms are approaching \( e \), and the terms near \( k = n \) are approximately \( e \). However, there are about \( n \) terms, each roughly of order up to \( e \). But if most terms are much smaller than \( e \), the sum might still be dominated by the last few terms. Wait, but how much do the terms near \( k = n \) contribute?

Suppose we consider the last \( m \) terms, where \( m \) is some fixed number. Each of these terms is approximately \( e \), so their total contribution is \( m e \). The rest of the terms (there are \( n - m \) of them) are smaller. If \( m \) is fixed, then as \( n \to \infty \), the sum \( a_n \) would be \( m e + o(n) \). But if \( m \) is allowed to grow with \( n \), say \( m = \sqrt{n} \), then the contribution would be \( \sqrt{n} e \), which is still \( o(n) \). Therefore, perhaps the sum is still dominated by the bulk of the terms rather than the last few.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by the integral \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \), as before, leading to linear growth. Let me compute \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \). The integral of \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is known as the imaginary error function, but its approximate value is indeed around 1.46265. So multiplying by \( n \), \( a_n \approx 1.46265 n \).

Therefore, \( a_n \) is roughly proportional to \( n \), so \( \ln a_n \approx \ln n + \ln(1.46265) \). Then, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln n}{n^2} + \frac{\ln(1.46265)}{n^2} \), both terms go to zero. Hence, \( \ln L = 0 \implies L = 1 \).

But let&#x27;s test this with numerical examples for small \( n \):

For \( n = 1 \), \( a_1 = (1 + 1/1^2)^1 = 2 \), so \( (a_1)^{-1/1^2} = 1/2 \).

For \( n = 2 \), \( a_2 = (1 + 1/4)^1 + (1 + 2/4)^2 = 5/4 + (3/2)^2 = 5/4 + 9/4 = 14/4 = 3.5 \), so \( (3.5)^{-1/4} \approx 0.645 \).

For \( n = 3 \), \( a_3 \approx 4.9753 \), so \( (4.9753)^{-1/9} \approx e^{-\ln(4.9753)/9} \approx e^{-1.606/9} \approx e^{-0.178} \approx 0.837 \).

For \( n = 10 \), if \( a_{10} \approx 10 \times 1.46265 \approx 14.6265 \), then \( (14.6265)^{-1/100} \approx e^{-\ln(14.6265)/100} \approx e^{-2.683/100} \approx e^{-0.02683} \approx 0.9736 \).

For \( n = 100 \), \( a_{100} \approx 146.265 \), so \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \approx e^{-\ln(146.265)/10000} \approx e^{-4.986/10000} \approx e^{-0.0004986} \approx 0.9995 \).

So as \( n \) increases, \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) seems to approach 1 from below. Therefore, the numerical evidence supports the analytical conclusion that the limit is 1.

However, I need to be careful here. The numerical examples for small \( n \) are not conclusive, but as \( n \) increases, the trend is clearly approaching 1. Hence, it&#x27;s reasonable to conclude that the limit is indeed 1.

But wait, let me consider another perspective. Suppose there exists a term in the sum \( a_n \) that grows exponentially with \( n^2 \), then \( a_n \) would be dominated by that term, and \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would tend to a value less than 1. But according to our analysis, all terms \( T_k \) are at most \( e \), and their sum grows linearly. So there&#x27;s no such term here. Therefore, the conclusion remains that the limit is 1.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider the possibility that the main contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \approx \sqrt{n} \). Wait, but why would that be? For \( k = \sqrt{n} \), \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \right)^{\sqrt{n}} \approx e^{\sqrt{n}/n^{3/2}} = e^{1/n} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{n} \). So these terms are close to 1. Therefore, such terms don&#x27;t contribute significantly.

Another angle: Let&#x27;s consider using the AM-GM inequality on the terms of the sum. The geometric mean of the terms is \( \left( \prod_{k=1}^n T_k \right)^{1/n} \leq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n T_k = \frac{a_n}{n} \). But I&#x27;m not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, note that since \( a_n \geq T_n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \), and \( a_n \leq n \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = n \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx n e \). Therefore, \( e \leq a_n \leq n e \). Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):

\( (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2} \).

Compute the limits of the bounds. The upper bound \( e^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \) as \( n \to \infty \). The lower bound \( (n e)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(n e)/n^2} = e^{-(\ln n + 1)/n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \). Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the limit is 1.

This is a solid argument. Since \( a_n \) is sandwiched between \( e \) and \( n e \), both of which raised to \( -1/n^2 \) tend to 1, so the limit must be 1.

Therefore, after considering various approaches—approximating the sum by an integral, analyzing individual terms, using inequalities—it seems consistent that the limit is 1. The key realization is that \( a_n \) grows polynomially (linearly) with \( n \), and thus \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) approaches 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \), we start by analyzing the behavior of the terms in the sum \( a_n \).

1. **Approximation of Terms**:
   Each term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \) can be approximated using the expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x \) for small \( x \). This gives:
   \[
   \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \approx \frac{k}{n^2}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2}
   \]

2. **Sum Approximation**:
   The sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by considering the behavior of \( e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For large \( n \), we approximate the sum by an integral:
   \[
   a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \approx n \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc
   \]
   where \( c = k/n \). The integral \( \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc \) is a constant, leading to \( a_n \approx C n \) for some constant \( C \).

3. **Logarithm and Limit Analysis**:
   Taking the logarithm of \( a_n \):
   \[
   \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n)
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) = 0 \implies L = e^0 = 1
   \]

4. **Squeeze Theorem**:
   Using bounds for \( a_n \):
   \[
   e \leq a_n \leq n e
   \]
   Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):
   \[
   (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2}
   \]
   Both bounds approach 1 as \( n \to \infty \), confirming the limit by the squeeze theorem.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

Response: Let&#x27;s use LHospital&#x27;s rule, and derive the limit: $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2}}{\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2}} \qquad a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k = \sum_{k=1}^n \prod_{h=1}^k \left(1 + \frac{h}{n^2}\right) \qquad = \sum_{k=1}^n \prod_{h=1}^{k-1}\left[1 + \left(1 +\frac{k}{n^2}\right)^{-1}\left(1 + \frac{h}{n^2}\right)\right] \qquad = \prod_{h=1}^n \left(1+\frac{h}{n^2}\right) + \sum_{k=1}^n \right) \frac{\prod_{h=1}\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) - \prod_{h=1}^{k-1}\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)}{\prod_{h=1}^{k-1} \left(1 + \frac{h}{n^2}\right)} \qquad = \prod_{h=1}^{n}\left(\frac{h}{n^2}\right) + \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{\prod_{h=1}^{k}\left(1 + \frac{h}{n^{2}}\right) - \prod_{h=1}^{k-1}\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^{2}}\right)}{\prod_{h=1}^{k-1} \left(1 + \frac{h}{n^2}\right)} \qquad = \prod_{h=1}^{n}\left(\frac{h}{n^2}\right) + \sum_{k=1}^{n} \left(\frac{1}{(k-1)n^2}\right) \frac{\prod_{h=1}^{k} \left(1 + \frac{h}{n^2}\right) - \prod_{h=1}^{k-1} \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)}{\prod_{h=1}^{k-1} \left(1 + \frac{h}{n^2}\right)} \qquad \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{(a_n)^{-1/n^2}}{ -\left(a_n\left((a_n)\right)^{-1/n^2}\right)} \qquad \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k\prod_{h=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{h}{n^2}\right) \prod_{h=1}^{k-1} \left(1 + \frac{h}{n^2}\right)^{-1} }{n\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k\prod_{h=1}^{k} \left(1 + \frac{h}{n^2}\right) \prod_{h=1}^{k-1} \left(1 + \frac{h}{n^2}\right)^{-1} }$$ As $n \rightarrow \infty$ the second fraction is $n\left(1+(2n^2)^{-1}\right)^n$, and the first is $n + n \sum_{k=1}^n (2n^2)^{-1}$, which is clearly $0$. Thus we conclude that the limit is equal to $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k}{\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k} = 1$$

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what&#x27;s given. The term \( a_n \) is a sum from \( k=1 \) to \( n \) of \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Then we need to take the inverse of \( a_n \), raise it to the power of \( 1/n^2 \), and find the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity.

Since the limit involves \( n \) in both the exponent and the sum, maybe I need to analyze the behavior of each term in the sum as \( n \) becomes very large. Then, perhaps the entire sum \( a_n \) can be approximated, and from there, we can take the limit.

Let me start by looking at the general term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). For fixed \( k \), as \( n \) becomes large, \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) becomes very small. However, since \( k \) ranges up to \( n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) is \( \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which also tends to zero as \( n \) grows. So each term in the sum is of the form \( (1 + \text{something small})^{\text{something}} \). Maybe I can use the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) when \( x \) is small. Let me check if that applies here.

If \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \) and \( y = k \), then \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). So perhaps \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \approx e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \). However, the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) is valid when \( x \) is small and \( xy \) is also small? Wait, for fixed \( k \), as \( n \to \infty \), \( x \) is small and \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \) is also small, so the approximation might work. But when \( k \) is comparable to \( n \), say \( k \approx n \), then \( xy = \frac{n^2}{n^2} = 1 \), so in that case, \( x = \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which is small, but \( xy = 1 \), so the approximation might not be so accurate. Hmm, so maybe the terms where \( k \) is small contribute \( e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \), and the terms where \( k \) is large (like near \( n \)) might need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the logarithm of \( a_n \) to turn the product into a sum? Wait, but \( a_n \) is already a sum. Taking logarithm might not help directly. However, since we have \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), taking the logarithm would turn this into \( -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \). So maybe I can compute the limit of \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), and then exponentiate the negative of that limit. Let&#x27;s see.

Let me denote \( L = \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \). Taking natural logarithm on both sides, we have:

\( \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \).

Therefore, if I can compute \( \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), then \( L = e^{- \text{that limit}} \).

So the key is to find the asymptotic behavior of \( \ln(a_n) \) as \( n \to \infty \), specifically its leading term divided by \( n^2 \).

To compute \( \ln(a_n) \), note that \( a_n \) is a sum of terms \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). The logarithm of a sum is tricky, but maybe the sum is dominated by its largest term? If that&#x27;s the case, then \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(\text{largest term}) \). Let&#x27;s check if that&#x27;s true here.

The terms in the sum \( a_n \) are \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s see how \( T_k \) behaves as \( n \to \infty \) for different ranges of \( k \).

Case 1: \( k \) is small compared to \( n \), say \( k = o(n) \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right)^k \approx 1 + o\left( \frac{k}{n} \right) \approx 1 \). So these terms are approximately 1.

Case 2: \( k \) is proportional to \( n \), say \( k = cn \) where \( c \) is a constant between 0 and 1. Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{c}{n} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c} \) as \( n \to \infty \), since \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^n \approx e^{c} \). Wait, but here the exponent is \( cn \), so \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \). Wait, actually:

Let me recall that \( \left(1 + \frac{a}{n} \right)^{bn} \approx e^{ab} \) as \( n \to \infty \). So here \( a = c \) and \( b = c \), so it&#x27;s \( e^{c^2} \). So \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \).

Case 3: \( k \) is near \( n \), say \( k = n - m \) for some fixed \( m \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{n - m}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \approx \frac{1}{n} \). Then \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \right)^{n - m} \approx \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n} \approx e \). So even for \( k \) near \( n \), the term \( T_k \) is roughly \( e \).

Wait, but if \( k = n \), then \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \). So the largest term in the sum is approximately \( e \), and other terms when \( k \) is proportional to \( n \) are like \( e^{c^2} \), which for \( c &lt; 1 \), \( c^2 &lt; 1 \), so those terms are smaller than \( e \). Therefore, the term with \( k = n \) is the largest one, approximately \( e \).

However, the sum \( a_n \) has \( n \) terms, each roughly up to \( e \). So if the largest term is \( e \), and there are \( n \) terms, then maybe the sum \( a_n \) is approximately \( n \times e \), but that might be an overestimate because most terms are smaller than \( e \). Wait, but when \( k \) is about \( cn \), then \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \), and as \( c \) goes from 0 to 1, \( e^{c^2} \) goes from 1 to \( e \). So the terms increase from 1 to \( e \). So the sum might be approximated by an integral over \( c \) from 0 to 1 of \( e^{c^2} \) multiplied by \( n \), since there are \( n \) terms each spaced by \( 1/n \).

Wait, maybe we can approximate the sum by an integral. Let me consider replacing the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n T_k \) with an integral over \( k \). Let me set \( c = k/n \), so that \( k = cn \), and \( dk = n \, dc \). Then, as \( n \to \infty \), the sum becomes approximately \( n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{cn}{n^2} \right)^{cn} \, dc = n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \, dc \).

Now, \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \), similar to before. Therefore, the integral becomes \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \). But wait, that would mean \( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \), which is \( n \times \text{some constant} \). However, this contradicts the earlier thought that the largest term is \( e \), but maybe the integral accounts for all terms. Wait, but integrating \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is a constant, so the sum would be approximately \( C n \), so \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C n) = \ln C + \ln n \). Then \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln C + \ln n}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \). But I feel like this might not be correct because I approximated the sum as \( Cn \), but maybe there&#x27;s a more precise estimation needed.

Alternatively, maybe the sum \( a_n \) is dominated by its last term \( T_n \approx e \), so \( a_n \approx e \), but that seems incorrect because there are \( n \) terms each contributing at least 1, so the sum is at least \( n \). But \( e \) is much smaller than \( n \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, this must not be the case.

Wait, there&#x27;s a contradiction here. If the largest term is \( e \), but there are \( n \) terms each contributing around 1 or more, then the sum must be at least \( n \), which tends to infinity. But then, if \( a_n \) is growing without bound, the limit \( \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would be \( 1 \), since any term growing to infinity raised to the power of \( -1/n^2 \) would tend to 1. Wait, but is that necessarily the case?

Let me think. Suppose \( a_n \) grows exponentially, say \( a_n \approx e^{n} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-n /n^2} = e^{-1/n} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows polynomially, say \( a_n \approx n^c \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-c \ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows like \( e^{n^2} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-1} \). So the key is to determine the growth rate of \( a_n \).

Therefore, to compute \( L = \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), we need to know whether \( a_n \) grows exponentially, polynomially, or otherwise. The answer hinges on the asymptotic behavior of \( a_n \).

Earlier, I thought that the sum \( a_n \) could be approximated by an integral leading to \( Cn \), but that would mean \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). However, perhaps my integral approximation is missing something?

Wait, let&#x27;s reconsider the approximation for \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s take the logarithm of \( T_k \):

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Using the Taylor expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \cdots \), we can expand this as:

\( \ln T_k \approx k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \).

Therefore, exponentiating, we have:

\( T_k \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \).

So for terms where \( k \) is small compared to \( n^{4/3} \), the correction term \( \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \) is negligible, so \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For larger \( k \), the approximation might break down, but if the dominant contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \) is not too large, maybe this is okay.

Therefore, maybe \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \). Let&#x27;s analyze this sum.

Again, let&#x27;s make a substitution \( c = k/n \), so \( k = cn \), \( c \in (0, 1] \). Then, \( e^{k^2 / n^2} = e^{c^2} \). The sum becomes approximately \( \sum_{c=1/n}^{1} e^{c^2} \cdot n \, dc \), which is similar to an integral. So:

\( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \).

But the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Then, \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \), so \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

But wait, the problem is that this approximation might not capture the true behavior of \( a_n \). If \( a_n \) is indeed growing linearly, then the limit is 1. However, perhaps the actual growth of \( a_n \) is faster than linear? Let&#x27;s check for specific values.

Take \( n = 2 \):

\( a_2 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{4}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{14}{4} = 3.5 \).

For \( n = 3 \):

\( a_3 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{9}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{9}\right)^2 + \left(1 + \frac{3}{9}\right)^3 \approx 1.1111 + (1.2222)^2 + (1.3333)^3 \approx 1.1111 + 1.4938 + 2.3704 \approx 4.9753 \).

For \( n = 10 \), it&#x27;s tedious to compute, but maybe we can see the trend. As \( n \) increases, each term \( T_k \) for \( k \) up to \( n \) is increasing from 1 to approximately \( e \). However, the number of terms is increasing as well. If each term is roughly \( e^{c^2} \), then the sum is like a Riemann sum for \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \times n \), which does grow linearly with \( n \).

But let&#x27;s check for \( n = 100 \). If \( a_{100} \approx 100 \times \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \approx 100 \times 1.46265 \approx 146.265 \). If we compute \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \), since \( 1/10000 \) is a very small exponent, the result should be very close to 1. Similarly, as \( n \) increases, \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(a_n)/n^2} \approx e^{- (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 } \approx 1 - (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 \), which tends to 1.

But the problem is that maybe the initial approximation where \( T_k \approx e^{k^2/n^2} \) is too crude. Let&#x27;s re-examine the term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \).

Taking the natural logarithm:

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Expanding the logarithm as a Taylor series:

\( \ln(1 + x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots \).

Here, \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \), so:

\( \ln T_k = k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \frac{k^3}{3n^6} - \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \frac{k^4}{3n^6} - \cdots \).

Therefore, the leading term is \( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). If we exponentiate this, we get:

\( T_k = \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \).

So the correction term is \( - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \). For the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \) to be valid, we need the next term \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) to be negligible compared to 1.

So \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \ll 1 \). For \( k \leq n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) is \( \frac{n^3}{n^4} = \frac{1}{n} \), which tends to 0 as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, even for the largest \( k = n \), the correction term is \( \frac{n^3}{2n^4} = \frac{1}{2n} \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is valid for all \( k \leq n \).

Therefore, the entire sum \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \).

Now, let&#x27;s analyze this sum. Let me make a substitution \( x = k/n \), so \( k = xn \), and \( x \) ranges from \( 1/n \) to 1 in increments of \( 1/n \). Then, \( e^{k^2 /n^2} = e^{x^2} \). The sum becomes:

\( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{x^2} \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

This is a Riemann sum approximation. The sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{(k/n)^2} \cdot \frac{1}{n} \approx \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \). Therefore, multiplying by \( n \), the original sum is approximately \( n \cdot \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

But wait, the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, the sum \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Therefore, \( \ln a_n \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \).

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln n}{n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( \ln n / n^2 \) and \( \ln C / n^2 \) tend to 0. Therefore, the limit is 0, so \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), which implies \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

However, this contradicts my earlier thought that maybe there&#x27;s a term contributing more significantly. Wait, but according to this Riemann sum approximation, the sum \( a_n \) grows linearly with \( n \). Therefore, \( a_n \) ~ \( C n \), so the inverse \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) is \( (C n)^{-1/n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( C^{-1/n^2} \) and \( n^{-1/n^2} \) approach 1, since any constant raised to the power \( -1/n^2 \) tends to 1, and \( n^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \).

Therefore, according to this reasoning, the limit should be 1. However, I recall that in some similar problems, even if the sum grows linearly, the limit might not be 1 due to more precise exponential terms. But in this case, since we&#x27;re taking the \( -1/n^2 \) power, which decays to zero, any polynomial growth in \( a_n \) would lead to the limit being 1. For example, if \( a_n = n \), then \( (n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). Similarly, if \( a_n = e^{o(n^2)} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). So unless \( a_n \) has a term like \( e^{n^2} \), the limit is 1.

But according to the previous analysis, the sum \( a_n \) is approximated by \( C n \), so the limit is 1. But maybe the approximation is missing an exponential term? Let me check with a different approach.

Alternative approach: Find the dominant term in the sum \( a_n \). Since each term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \), as we established earlier, the terms increase as \( k \) increases because \( e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is an increasing function of \( k \). Therefore, the last term \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2}\right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n \approx e \). The term before the last is \( T_{n-1} = \left(1 + \frac{n - 1}{n^2}\right)^{n - 1} \approx e^{(n - 1)^2 /n^2} \approx e^{1 - 2/n + 1/n^2} \approx e \cdot e^{-2/n} \approx e (1 - 2/n) \).

So the largest terms are approaching \( e \), and the terms near \( k = n \) are approximately \( e \). However, there are about \( n \) terms, each roughly of order up to \( e \). But if most terms are much smaller than \( e \), the sum might still be dominated by the last few terms. Wait, but how much do the terms near \( k = n \) contribute?

Suppose we consider the last \( m \) terms, where \( m \) is some fixed number. Each of these terms is approximately \( e \), so their total contribution is \( m e \). The rest of the terms (there are \( n - m \) of them) are smaller. If \( m \) is fixed, then as \( n \to \infty \), the sum \( a_n \) would be \( m e + o(n) \). But if \( m \) is allowed to grow with \( n \), say \( m = \sqrt{n} \), then the contribution would be \( \sqrt{n} e \), which is still \( o(n) \). Therefore, perhaps the sum is still dominated by the bulk of the terms rather than the last few.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by the integral \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \), as before, leading to linear growth. Let me compute \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \). The integral of \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is known as the imaginary error function, but its approximate value is indeed around 1.46265. So multiplying by \( n \), \( a_n \approx 1.46265 n \).

Therefore, \( a_n \) is roughly proportional to \( n \), so \( \ln a_n \approx \ln n + \ln(1.46265) \). Then, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln n}{n^2} + \frac{\ln(1.46265)}{n^2} \), both terms go to zero. Hence, \( \ln L = 0 \implies L = 1 \).

But let&#x27;s test this with numerical examples for small \( n \):

For \( n = 1 \), \( a_1 = (1 + 1/1^2)^1 = 2 \), so \( (a_1)^{-1/1^2} = 1/2 \).

For \( n = 2 \), \( a_2 = (1 + 1/4)^1 + (1 + 2/4)^2 = 5/4 + (3/2)^2 = 5/4 + 9/4 = 14/4 = 3.5 \), so \( (3.5)^{-1/4} \approx 0.645 \).

For \( n = 3 \), \( a_3 \approx 4.9753 \), so \( (4.9753)^{-1/9} \approx e^{-\ln(4.9753)/9} \approx e^{-1.606/9} \approx e^{-0.178} \approx 0.837 \).

For \( n = 10 \), if \( a_{10} \approx 10 \times 1.46265 \approx 14.6265 \), then \( (14.6265)^{-1/100} \approx e^{-\ln(14.6265)/100} \approx e^{-2.683/100} \approx e^{-0.02683} \approx 0.9736 \).

For \( n = 100 \), \( a_{100} \approx 146.265 \), so \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \approx e^{-\ln(146.265)/10000} \approx e^{-4.986/10000} \approx e^{-0.0004986} \approx 0.9995 \).

So as \( n \) increases, \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) seems to approach 1 from below. Therefore, the numerical evidence supports the analytical conclusion that the limit is 1.

However, I need to be careful here. The numerical examples for small \( n \) are not conclusive, but as \( n \) increases, the trend is clearly approaching 1. Hence, it&#x27;s reasonable to conclude that the limit is indeed 1.

But wait, let me consider another perspective. Suppose there exists a term in the sum \( a_n \) that grows exponentially with \( n^2 \), then \( a_n \) would be dominated by that term, and \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would tend to a value less than 1. But according to our analysis, all terms \( T_k \) are at most \( e \), and their sum grows linearly. So there&#x27;s no such term here. Therefore, the conclusion remains that the limit is 1.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider the possibility that the main contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \approx \sqrt{n} \). Wait, but why would that be? For \( k = \sqrt{n} \), \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \right)^{\sqrt{n}} \approx e^{\sqrt{n}/n^{3/2}} = e^{1/n} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{n} \). So these terms are close to 1. Therefore, such terms don&#x27;t contribute significantly.

Another angle: Let&#x27;s consider using the AM-GM inequality on the terms of the sum. The geometric mean of the terms is \( \left( \prod_{k=1}^n T_k \right)^{1/n} \leq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n T_k = \frac{a_n}{n} \). But I&#x27;m not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, note that since \( a_n \geq T_n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \), and \( a_n \leq n \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = n \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx n e \). Therefore, \( e \leq a_n \leq n e \). Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):

\( (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2} \).

Compute the limits of the bounds. The upper bound \( e^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \) as \( n \to \infty \). The lower bound \( (n e)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(n e)/n^2} = e^{-(\ln n + 1)/n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \). Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the limit is 1.

This is a solid argument. Since \( a_n \) is sandwiched between \( e \) and \( n e \), both of which raised to \( -1/n^2 \) tend to 1, so the limit must be 1.

Therefore, after considering various approaches—approximating the sum by an integral, analyzing individual terms, using inequalities—it seems consistent that the limit is 1. The key realization is that \( a_n \) grows polynomially (linearly) with \( n \), and thus \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) approaches 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \), we start by analyzing the behavior of the terms in the sum \( a_n \).

1. **Approximation of Terms**:
   Each term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \) can be approximated using the expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x \) for small \( x \). This gives:
   \[
   \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \approx \frac{k}{n^2}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2}
   \]

2. **Sum Approximation**:
   The sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by considering the behavior of \( e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For large \( n \), we approximate the sum by an integral:
   \[
   a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \approx n \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc
   \]
   where \( c = k/n \). The integral \( \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc \) is a constant, leading to \( a_n \approx C n \) for some constant \( C \).

3. **Logarithm and Limit Analysis**:
   Taking the logarithm of \( a_n \):
   \[
   \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n)
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) = 0 \implies L = e^0 = 1
   \]

4. **Squeeze Theorem**:
   Using bounds for \( a_n \):
   \[
   e \leq a_n \leq n e
   \]
   Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):
   \[
   (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2}
   \]
   Both bounds approach 1 as \( n \to \infty \), confirming the limit by the squeeze theorem.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

Response: Essentially, we have \(a_n = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{k}{n^2}\). As \( n \) gets large, \(\frac{k}{n^2}\) gets very small, so we can approximate \( a_n \) by \( 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} +... + \frac{n-1}{2n^2}\). Now, we can see that \( a_n \approx 1 + 2n - 2n^2 = n - 2n^2\). Therefore, \(\left( a_n \right)^{-1/n^2} = n^2 - 2n^2 = n^2 - 2n^2\).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what&#x27;s given. The term \( a_n \) is a sum from \( k=1 \) to \( n \) of \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Then we need to take the inverse of \( a_n \), raise it to the power of \( 1/n^2 \), and find the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity.

Since the limit involves \( n \) in both the exponent and the sum, maybe I need to analyze the behavior of each term in the sum as \( n \) becomes very large. Then, perhaps the entire sum \( a_n \) can be approximated, and from there, we can take the limit.

Let me start by looking at the general term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). For fixed \( k \), as \( n \) becomes large, \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) becomes very small. However, since \( k \) ranges up to \( n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) is \( \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which also tends to zero as \( n \) grows. So each term in the sum is of the form \( (1 + \text{something small})^{\text{something}} \). Maybe I can use the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) when \( x \) is small. Let me check if that applies here.

If \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \) and \( y = k \), then \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). So perhaps \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \approx e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \). However, the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) is valid when \( x \) is small and \( xy \) is also small? Wait, for fixed \( k \), as \( n \to \infty \), \( x \) is small and \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \) is also small, so the approximation might work. But when \( k \) is comparable to \( n \), say \( k \approx n \), then \( xy = \frac{n^2}{n^2} = 1 \), so in that case, \( x = \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which is small, but \( xy = 1 \), so the approximation might not be so accurate. Hmm, so maybe the terms where \( k \) is small contribute \( e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \), and the terms where \( k \) is large (like near \( n \)) might need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the logarithm of \( a_n \) to turn the product into a sum? Wait, but \( a_n \) is already a sum. Taking logarithm might not help directly. However, since we have \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), taking the logarithm would turn this into \( -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \). So maybe I can compute the limit of \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), and then exponentiate the negative of that limit. Let&#x27;s see.

Let me denote \( L = \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \). Taking natural logarithm on both sides, we have:

\( \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \).

Therefore, if I can compute \( \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), then \( L = e^{- \text{that limit}} \).

So the key is to find the asymptotic behavior of \( \ln(a_n) \) as \( n \to \infty \), specifically its leading term divided by \( n^2 \).

To compute \( \ln(a_n) \), note that \( a_n \) is a sum of terms \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). The logarithm of a sum is tricky, but maybe the sum is dominated by its largest term? If that&#x27;s the case, then \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(\text{largest term}) \). Let&#x27;s check if that&#x27;s true here.

The terms in the sum \( a_n \) are \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s see how \( T_k \) behaves as \( n \to \infty \) for different ranges of \( k \).

Case 1: \( k \) is small compared to \( n \), say \( k = o(n) \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right)^k \approx 1 + o\left( \frac{k}{n} \right) \approx 1 \). So these terms are approximately 1.

Case 2: \( k \) is proportional to \( n \), say \( k = cn \) where \( c \) is a constant between 0 and 1. Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{c}{n} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c} \) as \( n \to \infty \), since \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^n \approx e^{c} \). Wait, but here the exponent is \( cn \), so \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \). Wait, actually:

Let me recall that \( \left(1 + \frac{a}{n} \right)^{bn} \approx e^{ab} \) as \( n \to \infty \). So here \( a = c \) and \( b = c \), so it&#x27;s \( e^{c^2} \). So \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \).

Case 3: \( k \) is near \( n \), say \( k = n - m \) for some fixed \( m \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{n - m}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \approx \frac{1}{n} \). Then \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \right)^{n - m} \approx \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n} \approx e \). So even for \( k \) near \( n \), the term \( T_k \) is roughly \( e \).

Wait, but if \( k = n \), then \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \). So the largest term in the sum is approximately \( e \), and other terms when \( k \) is proportional to \( n \) are like \( e^{c^2} \), which for \( c &lt; 1 \), \( c^2 &lt; 1 \), so those terms are smaller than \( e \). Therefore, the term with \( k = n \) is the largest one, approximately \( e \).

However, the sum \( a_n \) has \( n \) terms, each roughly up to \( e \). So if the largest term is \( e \), and there are \( n \) terms, then maybe the sum \( a_n \) is approximately \( n \times e \), but that might be an overestimate because most terms are smaller than \( e \). Wait, but when \( k \) is about \( cn \), then \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \), and as \( c \) goes from 0 to 1, \( e^{c^2} \) goes from 1 to \( e \). So the terms increase from 1 to \( e \). So the sum might be approximated by an integral over \( c \) from 0 to 1 of \( e^{c^2} \) multiplied by \( n \), since there are \( n \) terms each spaced by \( 1/n \).

Wait, maybe we can approximate the sum by an integral. Let me consider replacing the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n T_k \) with an integral over \( k \). Let me set \( c = k/n \), so that \( k = cn \), and \( dk = n \, dc \). Then, as \( n \to \infty \), the sum becomes approximately \( n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{cn}{n^2} \right)^{cn} \, dc = n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \, dc \).

Now, \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \), similar to before. Therefore, the integral becomes \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \). But wait, that would mean \( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \), which is \( n \times \text{some constant} \). However, this contradicts the earlier thought that the largest term is \( e \), but maybe the integral accounts for all terms. Wait, but integrating \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is a constant, so the sum would be approximately \( C n \), so \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C n) = \ln C + \ln n \). Then \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln C + \ln n}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \). But I feel like this might not be correct because I approximated the sum as \( Cn \), but maybe there&#x27;s a more precise estimation needed.

Alternatively, maybe the sum \( a_n \) is dominated by its last term \( T_n \approx e \), so \( a_n \approx e \), but that seems incorrect because there are \( n \) terms each contributing at least 1, so the sum is at least \( n \). But \( e \) is much smaller than \( n \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, this must not be the case.

Wait, there&#x27;s a contradiction here. If the largest term is \( e \), but there are \( n \) terms each contributing around 1 or more, then the sum must be at least \( n \), which tends to infinity. But then, if \( a_n \) is growing without bound, the limit \( \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would be \( 1 \), since any term growing to infinity raised to the power of \( -1/n^2 \) would tend to 1. Wait, but is that necessarily the case?

Let me think. Suppose \( a_n \) grows exponentially, say \( a_n \approx e^{n} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-n /n^2} = e^{-1/n} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows polynomially, say \( a_n \approx n^c \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-c \ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows like \( e^{n^2} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-1} \). So the key is to determine the growth rate of \( a_n \).

Therefore, to compute \( L = \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), we need to know whether \( a_n \) grows exponentially, polynomially, or otherwise. The answer hinges on the asymptotic behavior of \( a_n \).

Earlier, I thought that the sum \( a_n \) could be approximated by an integral leading to \( Cn \), but that would mean \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). However, perhaps my integral approximation is missing something?

Wait, let&#x27;s reconsider the approximation for \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s take the logarithm of \( T_k \):

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Using the Taylor expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \cdots \), we can expand this as:

\( \ln T_k \approx k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \).

Therefore, exponentiating, we have:

\( T_k \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \).

So for terms where \( k \) is small compared to \( n^{4/3} \), the correction term \( \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \) is negligible, so \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For larger \( k \), the approximation might break down, but if the dominant contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \) is not too large, maybe this is okay.

Therefore, maybe \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \). Let&#x27;s analyze this sum.

Again, let&#x27;s make a substitution \( c = k/n \), so \( k = cn \), \( c \in (0, 1] \). Then, \( e^{k^2 / n^2} = e^{c^2} \). The sum becomes approximately \( \sum_{c=1/n}^{1} e^{c^2} \cdot n \, dc \), which is similar to an integral. So:

\( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \).

But the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Then, \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \), so \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

But wait, the problem is that this approximation might not capture the true behavior of \( a_n \). If \( a_n \) is indeed growing linearly, then the limit is 1. However, perhaps the actual growth of \( a_n \) is faster than linear? Let&#x27;s check for specific values.

Take \( n = 2 \):

\( a_2 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{4}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{14}{4} = 3.5 \).

For \( n = 3 \):

\( a_3 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{9}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{9}\right)^2 + \left(1 + \frac{3}{9}\right)^3 \approx 1.1111 + (1.2222)^2 + (1.3333)^3 \approx 1.1111 + 1.4938 + 2.3704 \approx 4.9753 \).

For \( n = 10 \), it&#x27;s tedious to compute, but maybe we can see the trend. As \( n \) increases, each term \( T_k \) for \( k \) up to \( n \) is increasing from 1 to approximately \( e \). However, the number of terms is increasing as well. If each term is roughly \( e^{c^2} \), then the sum is like a Riemann sum for \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \times n \), which does grow linearly with \( n \).

But let&#x27;s check for \( n = 100 \). If \( a_{100} \approx 100 \times \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \approx 100 \times 1.46265 \approx 146.265 \). If we compute \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \), since \( 1/10000 \) is a very small exponent, the result should be very close to 1. Similarly, as \( n \) increases, \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(a_n)/n^2} \approx e^{- (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 } \approx 1 - (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 \), which tends to 1.

But the problem is that maybe the initial approximation where \( T_k \approx e^{k^2/n^2} \) is too crude. Let&#x27;s re-examine the term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \).

Taking the natural logarithm:

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Expanding the logarithm as a Taylor series:

\( \ln(1 + x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots \).

Here, \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \), so:

\( \ln T_k = k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \frac{k^3}{3n^6} - \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \frac{k^4}{3n^6} - \cdots \).

Therefore, the leading term is \( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). If we exponentiate this, we get:

\( T_k = \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \).

So the correction term is \( - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \). For the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \) to be valid, we need the next term \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) to be negligible compared to 1.

So \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \ll 1 \). For \( k \leq n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) is \( \frac{n^3}{n^4} = \frac{1}{n} \), which tends to 0 as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, even for the largest \( k = n \), the correction term is \( \frac{n^3}{2n^4} = \frac{1}{2n} \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is valid for all \( k \leq n \).

Therefore, the entire sum \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \).

Now, let&#x27;s analyze this sum. Let me make a substitution \( x = k/n \), so \( k = xn \), and \( x \) ranges from \( 1/n \) to 1 in increments of \( 1/n \). Then, \( e^{k^2 /n^2} = e^{x^2} \). The sum becomes:

\( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{x^2} \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

This is a Riemann sum approximation. The sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{(k/n)^2} \cdot \frac{1}{n} \approx \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \). Therefore, multiplying by \( n \), the original sum is approximately \( n \cdot \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

But wait, the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, the sum \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Therefore, \( \ln a_n \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \).

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln n}{n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( \ln n / n^2 \) and \( \ln C / n^2 \) tend to 0. Therefore, the limit is 0, so \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), which implies \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

However, this contradicts my earlier thought that maybe there&#x27;s a term contributing more significantly. Wait, but according to this Riemann sum approximation, the sum \( a_n \) grows linearly with \( n \). Therefore, \( a_n \) ~ \( C n \), so the inverse \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) is \( (C n)^{-1/n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( C^{-1/n^2} \) and \( n^{-1/n^2} \) approach 1, since any constant raised to the power \( -1/n^2 \) tends to 1, and \( n^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \).

Therefore, according to this reasoning, the limit should be 1. However, I recall that in some similar problems, even if the sum grows linearly, the limit might not be 1 due to more precise exponential terms. But in this case, since we&#x27;re taking the \( -1/n^2 \) power, which decays to zero, any polynomial growth in \( a_n \) would lead to the limit being 1. For example, if \( a_n = n \), then \( (n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). Similarly, if \( a_n = e^{o(n^2)} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). So unless \( a_n \) has a term like \( e^{n^2} \), the limit is 1.

But according to the previous analysis, the sum \( a_n \) is approximated by \( C n \), so the limit is 1. But maybe the approximation is missing an exponential term? Let me check with a different approach.

Alternative approach: Find the dominant term in the sum \( a_n \). Since each term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \), as we established earlier, the terms increase as \( k \) increases because \( e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is an increasing function of \( k \). Therefore, the last term \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2}\right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n \approx e \). The term before the last is \( T_{n-1} = \left(1 + \frac{n - 1}{n^2}\right)^{n - 1} \approx e^{(n - 1)^2 /n^2} \approx e^{1 - 2/n + 1/n^2} \approx e \cdot e^{-2/n} \approx e (1 - 2/n) \).

So the largest terms are approaching \( e \), and the terms near \( k = n \) are approximately \( e \). However, there are about \( n \) terms, each roughly of order up to \( e \). But if most terms are much smaller than \( e \), the sum might still be dominated by the last few terms. Wait, but how much do the terms near \( k = n \) contribute?

Suppose we consider the last \( m \) terms, where \( m \) is some fixed number. Each of these terms is approximately \( e \), so their total contribution is \( m e \). The rest of the terms (there are \( n - m \) of them) are smaller. If \( m \) is fixed, then as \( n \to \infty \), the sum \( a_n \) would be \( m e + o(n) \). But if \( m \) is allowed to grow with \( n \), say \( m = \sqrt{n} \), then the contribution would be \( \sqrt{n} e \), which is still \( o(n) \). Therefore, perhaps the sum is still dominated by the bulk of the terms rather than the last few.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by the integral \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \), as before, leading to linear growth. Let me compute \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \). The integral of \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is known as the imaginary error function, but its approximate value is indeed around 1.46265. So multiplying by \( n \), \( a_n \approx 1.46265 n \).

Therefore, \( a_n \) is roughly proportional to \( n \), so \( \ln a_n \approx \ln n + \ln(1.46265) \). Then, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln n}{n^2} + \frac{\ln(1.46265)}{n^2} \), both terms go to zero. Hence, \( \ln L = 0 \implies L = 1 \).

But let&#x27;s test this with numerical examples for small \( n \):

For \( n = 1 \), \( a_1 = (1 + 1/1^2)^1 = 2 \), so \( (a_1)^{-1/1^2} = 1/2 \).

For \( n = 2 \), \( a_2 = (1 + 1/4)^1 + (1 + 2/4)^2 = 5/4 + (3/2)^2 = 5/4 + 9/4 = 14/4 = 3.5 \), so \( (3.5)^{-1/4} \approx 0.645 \).

For \( n = 3 \), \( a_3 \approx 4.9753 \), so \( (4.9753)^{-1/9} \approx e^{-\ln(4.9753)/9} \approx e^{-1.606/9} \approx e^{-0.178} \approx 0.837 \).

For \( n = 10 \), if \( a_{10} \approx 10 \times 1.46265 \approx 14.6265 \), then \( (14.6265)^{-1/100} \approx e^{-\ln(14.6265)/100} \approx e^{-2.683/100} \approx e^{-0.02683} \approx 0.9736 \).

For \( n = 100 \), \( a_{100} \approx 146.265 \), so \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \approx e^{-\ln(146.265)/10000} \approx e^{-4.986/10000} \approx e^{-0.0004986} \approx 0.9995 \).

So as \( n \) increases, \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) seems to approach 1 from below. Therefore, the numerical evidence supports the analytical conclusion that the limit is 1.

However, I need to be careful here. The numerical examples for small \( n \) are not conclusive, but as \( n \) increases, the trend is clearly approaching 1. Hence, it&#x27;s reasonable to conclude that the limit is indeed 1.

But wait, let me consider another perspective. Suppose there exists a term in the sum \( a_n \) that grows exponentially with \( n^2 \), then \( a_n \) would be dominated by that term, and \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would tend to a value less than 1. But according to our analysis, all terms \( T_k \) are at most \( e \), and their sum grows linearly. So there&#x27;s no such term here. Therefore, the conclusion remains that the limit is 1.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider the possibility that the main contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \approx \sqrt{n} \). Wait, but why would that be? For \( k = \sqrt{n} \), \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \right)^{\sqrt{n}} \approx e^{\sqrt{n}/n^{3/2}} = e^{1/n} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{n} \). So these terms are close to 1. Therefore, such terms don&#x27;t contribute significantly.

Another angle: Let&#x27;s consider using the AM-GM inequality on the terms of the sum. The geometric mean of the terms is \( \left( \prod_{k=1}^n T_k \right)^{1/n} \leq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n T_k = \frac{a_n}{n} \). But I&#x27;m not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, note that since \( a_n \geq T_n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \), and \( a_n \leq n \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = n \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx n e \). Therefore, \( e \leq a_n \leq n e \). Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):

\( (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2} \).

Compute the limits of the bounds. The upper bound \( e^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \) as \( n \to \infty \). The lower bound \( (n e)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(n e)/n^2} = e^{-(\ln n + 1)/n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \). Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the limit is 1.

This is a solid argument. Since \( a_n \) is sandwiched between \( e \) and \( n e \), both of which raised to \( -1/n^2 \) tend to 1, so the limit must be 1.

Therefore, after considering various approaches—approximating the sum by an integral, analyzing individual terms, using inequalities—it seems consistent that the limit is 1. The key realization is that \( a_n \) grows polynomially (linearly) with \( n \), and thus \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) approaches 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \), we start by analyzing the behavior of the terms in the sum \( a_n \).

1. **Approximation of Terms**:
   Each term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \) can be approximated using the expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x \) for small \( x \). This gives:
   \[
   \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \approx \frac{k}{n^2}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2}
   \]

2. **Sum Approximation**:
   The sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by considering the behavior of \( e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For large \( n \), we approximate the sum by an integral:
   \[
   a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \approx n \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc
   \]
   where \( c = k/n \). The integral \( \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc \) is a constant, leading to \( a_n \approx C n \) for some constant \( C \).

3. **Logarithm and Limit Analysis**:
   Taking the logarithm of \( a_n \):
   \[
   \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n)
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) = 0 \implies L = e^0 = 1
   \]

4. **Squeeze Theorem**:
   Using bounds for \( a_n \):
   \[
   e \leq a_n \leq n e
   \]
   Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):
   \[
   (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2}
   \]
   Both bounds approach 1 as \( n \to \infty \), confirming the limit by the squeeze theorem.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[

Problem: Evaluate the limit \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: To evaluate the limit, we first use algebra to rewrite our function:

\[ \begin{gather} a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k = \sum_{k=1}^n \sum_{j = n \choose k} \frac{(n^2)^j}{j!} \left( \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k = \sum_{j \in \bb{N}} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{(n^2)^j}{j!} \left( \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \\ = \sum_{j \in \bb{N}} \frac{(n^2)^j}{j!} \sum_{k=1}^n \left( \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \end{gather} \]

Now we use our bounds on the sum to rewrite our limit:

\[ \begin{gather} \lim_{n \to \infty} \left( a_n^{1/n^2} \right) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left( \sum_{j \in \bb{N}} \frac{(n^2)^j}{j!} \sum_{k=1}^n \left( \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \right)^{1/n^2} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{j \in \bb{N}} \left( \frac{1}{j!} \sum_{k=1}^n \left( \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^{j/n^2} \right)^{1/n^2} \\ = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{j \in \bb{N}} \left( \frac{1}{j!} \left( p \sum_{k=1}^n \left( \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \right)^{j/n^2} \right)^{1/n^2} \end{gather} \]

Where \(p=\left(\frac{1}{n^2}\right)\).

Let&#x27;s use the definition of a limit and write out this limit recursively. Our goal is to show that the infinite sum converges to a non-zero value.

Assuming \(p \lt 1 \), we know that the first term of our series \( \frac{1}{j!} \left( p \sum_{k=1}^n \left( \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \right)^{j/n^2} \) does not go to zero when \( n \to \infty \).

Now we want to estimate the second term \( \frac{1}{j!} (q \sum_{k=1}^n (\frac{k}{n^2})^k)^{j/n^2} \) using the ratio test. We note that:

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} max \left( \frac{ \sum_{k=1}^n (\frac{k}{n^2})^k }{\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (\frac{k}{n^2})^k } \right) = \lim_{n \to \infty} max \left( \frac{ \sum_{k=1}^n (\frac{k}{n^2})^k }{\sum_{k=2}^n (\frac{k-1}{n^2})^2} \right) = \lim_{n \to \infty} 4 = 4 \]

Letting \( q=n^{-2}\), we have that:

\[ \frac{ 1 }{j!} \left( q \sum_{k=1}^n \left( \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \right)^{j/n^2} &gt; \frac{1}{j!} \left( \frac{4}{n^2} \sum_{k=1}^n \left( \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \right)^{j/n^2} \]

When we substitute bounds we find

\[ \begin{gather} \frac{ 1 }{j!} \left( q \sum_{k=1}^n \left( \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \right)^{j/n^2} &gt; \frac{1}{j!} \left( \frac{4}{n^2} \sum_{k=1}^n \left( \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \right)^{j/n^2} &gt; \frac{1}{j!} \left( \frac{4}{n^2} \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor \frac{1}{p}n^{2/3} \rfloor} \left( \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \right)^{j/n^2} \\ = \frac{1}{j!} \left( \frac{4}{n^2} \left( \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor \frac{1}{p}n^{2/3} \rfloor} \left( \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \right)^{\lceil j/n^2 \rceil} \right) \geq \frac{1}{j!} \left[ \frac{4}{n^2} \left( 1 - (\frac{1}{p}n^{2/3})^{\lceil j/n^2 \rceil} \right) \right]^{\lceil j/n^2 \rceil} \end{gather} \]

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what&#x27;s given. The term \( a_n \) is a sum from \( k=1 \) to \( n \) of \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Then we need to take the inverse of \( a_n \), raise it to the power of \( 1/n^2 \), and find the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity.

Since the limit involves \( n \) in both the exponent and the sum, maybe I need to analyze the behavior of each term in the sum as \( n \) becomes very large. Then, perhaps the entire sum \( a_n \) can be approximated, and from there, we can take the limit.

Let me start by looking at the general term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). For fixed \( k \), as \( n \) becomes large, \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) becomes very small. However, since \( k \) ranges up to \( n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) is \( \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which also tends to zero as \( n \) grows. So each term in the sum is of the form \( (1 + \text{something small})^{\text{something}} \). Maybe I can use the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) when \( x \) is small. Let me check if that applies here.

If \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \) and \( y = k \), then \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). So perhaps \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \approx e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \). However, the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) is valid when \( x \) is small and \( xy \) is also small? Wait, for fixed \( k \), as \( n \to \infty \), \( x \) is small and \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \) is also small, so the approximation might work. But when \( k \) is comparable to \( n \), say \( k \approx n \), then \( xy = \frac{n^2}{n^2} = 1 \), so in that case, \( x = \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which is small, but \( xy = 1 \), so the approximation might not be so accurate. Hmm, so maybe the terms where \( k \) is small contribute \( e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \), and the terms where \( k \) is large (like near \( n \)) might need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the logarithm of \( a_n \) to turn the product into a sum? Wait, but \( a_n \) is already a sum. Taking logarithm might not help directly. However, since we have \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), taking the logarithm would turn this into \( -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \). So maybe I can compute the limit of \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), and then exponentiate the negative of that limit. Let&#x27;s see.

Let me denote \( L = \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \). Taking natural logarithm on both sides, we have:

\( \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \).

Therefore, if I can compute \( \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), then \( L = e^{- \text{that limit}} \).

So the key is to find the asymptotic behavior of \( \ln(a_n) \) as \( n \to \infty \), specifically its leading term divided by \( n^2 \).

To compute \( \ln(a_n) \), note that \( a_n \) is a sum of terms \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). The logarithm of a sum is tricky, but maybe the sum is dominated by its largest term? If that&#x27;s the case, then \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(\text{largest term}) \). Let&#x27;s check if that&#x27;s true here.

The terms in the sum \( a_n \) are \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s see how \( T_k \) behaves as \( n \to \infty \) for different ranges of \( k \).

Case 1: \( k \) is small compared to \( n \), say \( k = o(n) \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right)^k \approx 1 + o\left( \frac{k}{n} \right) \approx 1 \). So these terms are approximately 1.

Case 2: \( k \) is proportional to \( n \), say \( k = cn \) where \( c \) is a constant between 0 and 1. Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{c}{n} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c} \) as \( n \to \infty \), since \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^n \approx e^{c} \). Wait, but here the exponent is \( cn \), so \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \). Wait, actually:

Let me recall that \( \left(1 + \frac{a}{n} \right)^{bn} \approx e^{ab} \) as \( n \to \infty \). So here \( a = c \) and \( b = c \), so it&#x27;s \( e^{c^2} \). So \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \).

Case 3: \( k \) is near \( n \), say \( k = n - m \) for some fixed \( m \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{n - m}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \approx \frac{1}{n} \). Then \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \right)^{n - m} \approx \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n} \approx e \). So even for \( k \) near \( n \), the term \( T_k \) is roughly \( e \).

Wait, but if \( k = n \), then \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \). So the largest term in the sum is approximately \( e \), and other terms when \( k \) is proportional to \( n \) are like \( e^{c^2} \), which for \( c &lt; 1 \), \( c^2 &lt; 1 \), so those terms are smaller than \( e \). Therefore, the term with \( k = n \) is the largest one, approximately \( e \).

However, the sum \( a_n \) has \( n \) terms, each roughly up to \( e \). So if the largest term is \( e \), and there are \( n \) terms, then maybe the sum \( a_n \) is approximately \( n \times e \), but that might be an overestimate because most terms are smaller than \( e \). Wait, but when \( k \) is about \( cn \), then \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \), and as \( c \) goes from 0 to 1, \( e^{c^2} \) goes from 1 to \( e \). So the terms increase from 1 to \( e \). So the sum might be approximated by an integral over \( c \) from 0 to 1 of \( e^{c^2} \) multiplied by \( n \), since there are \( n \) terms each spaced by \( 1/n \).

Wait, maybe we can approximate the sum by an integral. Let me consider replacing the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n T_k \) with an integral over \( k \). Let me set \( c = k/n \), so that \( k = cn \), and \( dk = n \, dc \). Then, as \( n \to \infty \), the sum becomes approximately \( n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{cn}{n^2} \right)^{cn} \, dc = n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \, dc \).

Now, \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \), similar to before. Therefore, the integral becomes \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \). But wait, that would mean \( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \), which is \( n \times \text{some constant} \). However, this contradicts the earlier thought that the largest term is \( e \), but maybe the integral accounts for all terms. Wait, but integrating \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is a constant, so the sum would be approximately \( C n \), so \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C n) = \ln C + \ln n \). Then \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln C + \ln n}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \). But I feel like this might not be correct because I approximated the sum as \( Cn \), but maybe there&#x27;s a more precise estimation needed.

Alternatively, maybe the sum \( a_n \) is dominated by its last term \( T_n \approx e \), so \( a_n \approx e \), but that seems incorrect because there are \( n \) terms each contributing at least 1, so the sum is at least \( n \). But \( e \) is much smaller than \( n \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, this must not be the case.

Wait, there&#x27;s a contradiction here. If the largest term is \( e \), but there are \( n \) terms each contributing around 1 or more, then the sum must be at least \( n \), which tends to infinity. But then, if \( a_n \) is growing without bound, the limit \( \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would be \( 1 \), since any term growing to infinity raised to the power of \( -1/n^2 \) would tend to 1. Wait, but is that necessarily the case?

Let me think. Suppose \( a_n \) grows exponentially, say \( a_n \approx e^{n} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-n /n^2} = e^{-1/n} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows polynomially, say \( a_n \approx n^c \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-c \ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows like \( e^{n^2} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-1} \). So the key is to determine the growth rate of \( a_n \).

Therefore, to compute \( L = \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), we need to know whether \( a_n \) grows exponentially, polynomially, or otherwise. The answer hinges on the asymptotic behavior of \( a_n \).

Earlier, I thought that the sum \( a_n \) could be approximated by an integral leading to \( Cn \), but that would mean \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). However, perhaps my integral approximation is missing something?

Wait, let&#x27;s reconsider the approximation for \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s take the logarithm of \( T_k \):

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Using the Taylor expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \cdots \), we can expand this as:

\( \ln T_k \approx k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \).

Therefore, exponentiating, we have:

\( T_k \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \).

So for terms where \( k \) is small compared to \( n^{4/3} \), the correction term \( \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \) is negligible, so \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For larger \( k \), the approximation might break down, but if the dominant contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \) is not too large, maybe this is okay.

Therefore, maybe \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \). Let&#x27;s analyze this sum.

Again, let&#x27;s make a substitution \( c = k/n \), so \( k = cn \), \( c \in (0, 1] \). Then, \( e^{k^2 / n^2} = e^{c^2} \). The sum becomes approximately \( \sum_{c=1/n}^{1} e^{c^2} \cdot n \, dc \), which is similar to an integral. So:

\( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \).

But the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Then, \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \), so \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

But wait, the problem is that this approximation might not capture the true behavior of \( a_n \). If \( a_n \) is indeed growing linearly, then the limit is 1. However, perhaps the actual growth of \( a_n \) is faster than linear? Let&#x27;s check for specific values.

Take \( n = 2 \):

\( a_2 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{4}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{14}{4} = 3.5 \).

For \( n = 3 \):

\( a_3 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{9}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{9}\right)^2 + \left(1 + \frac{3}{9}\right)^3 \approx 1.1111 + (1.2222)^2 + (1.3333)^3 \approx 1.1111 + 1.4938 + 2.3704 \approx 4.9753 \).

For \( n = 10 \), it&#x27;s tedious to compute, but maybe we can see the trend. As \( n \) increases, each term \( T_k \) for \( k \) up to \( n \) is increasing from 1 to approximately \( e \). However, the number of terms is increasing as well. If each term is roughly \( e^{c^2} \), then the sum is like a Riemann sum for \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \times n \), which does grow linearly with \( n \).

But let&#x27;s check for \( n = 100 \). If \( a_{100} \approx 100 \times \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \approx 100 \times 1.46265 \approx 146.265 \). If we compute \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \), since \( 1/10000 \) is a very small exponent, the result should be very close to 1. Similarly, as \( n \) increases, \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(a_n)/n^2} \approx e^{- (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 } \approx 1 - (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 \), which tends to 1.

But the problem is that maybe the initial approximation where \( T_k \approx e^{k^2/n^2} \) is too crude. Let&#x27;s re-examine the term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \).

Taking the natural logarithm:

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Expanding the logarithm as a Taylor series:

\( \ln(1 + x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots \).

Here, \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \), so:

\( \ln T_k = k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \frac{k^3}{3n^6} - \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \frac{k^4}{3n^6} - \cdots \).

Therefore, the leading term is \( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). If we exponentiate this, we get:

\( T_k = \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \).

So the correction term is \( - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \). For the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \) to be valid, we need the next term \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) to be negligible compared to 1.

So \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \ll 1 \). For \( k \leq n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) is \( \frac{n^3}{n^4} = \frac{1}{n} \), which tends to 0 as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, even for the largest \( k = n \), the correction term is \( \frac{n^3}{2n^4} = \frac{1}{2n} \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is valid for all \( k \leq n \).

Therefore, the entire sum \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \).

Now, let&#x27;s analyze this sum. Let me make a substitution \( x = k/n \), so \( k = xn \), and \( x \) ranges from \( 1/n \) to 1 in increments of \( 1/n \). Then, \( e^{k^2 /n^2} = e^{x^2} \). The sum becomes:

\( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{x^2} \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

This is a Riemann sum approximation. The sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{(k/n)^2} \cdot \frac{1}{n} \approx \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \). Therefore, multiplying by \( n \), the original sum is approximately \( n \cdot \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

But wait, the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, the sum \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Therefore, \( \ln a_n \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \).

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln n}{n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( \ln n / n^2 \) and \( \ln C / n^2 \) tend to 0. Therefore, the limit is 0, so \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), which implies \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

However, this contradicts my earlier thought that maybe there&#x27;s a term contributing more significantly. Wait, but according to this Riemann sum approximation, the sum \( a_n \) grows linearly with \( n \). Therefore, \( a_n \) ~ \( C n \), so the inverse \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) is \( (C n)^{-1/n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( C^{-1/n^2} \) and \( n^{-1/n^2} \) approach 1, since any constant raised to the power \( -1/n^2 \) tends to 1, and \( n^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \).

Therefore, according to this reasoning, the limit should be 1. However, I recall that in some similar problems, even if the sum grows linearly, the limit might not be 1 due to more precise exponential terms. But in this case, since we&#x27;re taking the \( -1/n^2 \) power, which decays to zero, any polynomial growth in \( a_n \) would lead to the limit being 1. For example, if \( a_n = n \), then \( (n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). Similarly, if \( a_n = e^{o(n^2)} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). So unless \( a_n \) has a term like \( e^{n^2} \), the limit is 1.

But according to the previous analysis, the sum \( a_n \) is approximated by \( C n \), so the limit is 1. But maybe the approximation is missing an exponential term? Let me check with a different approach.

Alternative approach: Find the dominant term in the sum \( a_n \). Since each term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \), as we established earlier, the terms increase as \( k \) increases because \( e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is an increasing function of \( k \). Therefore, the last term \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2}\right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n \approx e \). The term before the last is \( T_{n-1} = \left(1 + \frac{n - 1}{n^2}\right)^{n - 1} \approx e^{(n - 1)^2 /n^2} \approx e^{1 - 2/n + 1/n^2} \approx e \cdot e^{-2/n} \approx e (1 - 2/n) \).

So the largest terms are approaching \( e \), and the terms near \( k = n \) are approximately \( e \). However, there are about \( n \) terms, each roughly of order up to \( e \). But if most terms are much smaller than \( e \), the sum might still be dominated by the last few terms. Wait, but how much do the terms near \( k = n \) contribute?

Suppose we consider the last \( m \) terms, where \( m \) is some fixed number. Each of these terms is approximately \( e \), so their total contribution is \( m e \). The rest of the terms (there are \( n - m \) of them) are smaller. If \( m \) is fixed, then as \( n \to \infty \), the sum \( a_n \) would be \( m e + o(n) \). But if \( m \) is allowed to grow with \( n \), say \( m = \sqrt{n} \), then the contribution would be \( \sqrt{n} e \), which is still \( o(n) \). Therefore, perhaps the sum is still dominated by the bulk of the terms rather than the last few.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by the integral \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \), as before, leading to linear growth. Let me compute \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \). The integral of \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is known as the imaginary error function, but its approximate value is indeed around 1.46265. So multiplying by \( n \), \( a_n \approx 1.46265 n \).

Therefore, \( a_n \) is roughly proportional to \( n \), so \( \ln a_n \approx \ln n + \ln(1.46265) \). Then, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln n}{n^2} + \frac{\ln(1.46265)}{n^2} \), both terms go to zero. Hence, \( \ln L = 0 \implies L = 1 \).

But let&#x27;s test this with numerical examples for small \( n \):

For \( n = 1 \), \( a_1 = (1 + 1/1^2)^1 = 2 \), so \( (a_1)^{-1/1^2} = 1/2 \).

For \( n = 2 \), \( a_2 = (1 + 1/4)^1 + (1 + 2/4)^2 = 5/4 + (3/2)^2 = 5/4 + 9/4 = 14/4 = 3.5 \), so \( (3.5)^{-1/4} \approx 0.645 \).

For \( n = 3 \), \( a_3 \approx 4.9753 \), so \( (4.9753)^{-1/9} \approx e^{-\ln(4.9753)/9} \approx e^{-1.606/9} \approx e^{-0.178} \approx 0.837 \).

For \( n = 10 \), if \( a_{10} \approx 10 \times 1.46265 \approx 14.6265 \), then \( (14.6265)^{-1/100} \approx e^{-\ln(14.6265)/100} \approx e^{-2.683/100} \approx e^{-0.02683} \approx 0.9736 \).

For \( n = 100 \), \( a_{100} \approx 146.265 \), so \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \approx e^{-\ln(146.265)/10000} \approx e^{-4.986/10000} \approx e^{-0.0004986} \approx 0.9995 \).

So as \( n \) increases, \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) seems to approach 1 from below. Therefore, the numerical evidence supports the analytical conclusion that the limit is 1.

However, I need to be careful here. The numerical examples for small \( n \) are not conclusive, but as \( n \) increases, the trend is clearly approaching 1. Hence, it&#x27;s reasonable to conclude that the limit is indeed 1.

But wait, let me consider another perspective. Suppose there exists a term in the sum \( a_n \) that grows exponentially with \( n^2 \), then \( a_n \) would be dominated by that term, and \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would tend to a value less than 1. But according to our analysis, all terms \( T_k \) are at most \( e \), and their sum grows linearly. So there&#x27;s no such term here. Therefore, the conclusion remains that the limit is 1.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider the possibility that the main contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \approx \sqrt{n} \). Wait, but why would that be? For \( k = \sqrt{n} \), \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \right)^{\sqrt{n}} \approx e^{\sqrt{n}/n^{3/2}} = e^{1/n} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{n} \). So these terms are close to 1. Therefore, such terms don&#x27;t contribute significantly.

Another angle: Let&#x27;s consider using the AM-GM inequality on the terms of the sum. The geometric mean of the terms is \( \left( \prod_{k=1}^n T_k \right)^{1/n} \leq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n T_k = \frac{a_n}{n} \). But I&#x27;m not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, note that since \( a_n \geq T_n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \), and \( a_n \leq n \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = n \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx n e \). Therefore, \( e \leq a_n \leq n e \). Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):

\( (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2} \).

Compute the limits of the bounds. The upper bound \( e^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \) as \( n \to \infty \). The lower bound \( (n e)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(n e)/n^2} = e^{-(\ln n + 1)/n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \). Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the limit is 1.

This is a solid argument. Since \( a_n \) is sandwiched between \( e \) and \( n e \), both of which raised to \( -1/n^2 \) tend to 1, so the limit must be 1.

Therefore, after considering various approaches—approximating the sum by an integral, analyzing individual terms, using inequalities—it seems consistent that the limit is 1. The key realization is that \( a_n \) grows polynomially (linearly) with \( n \), and thus \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) approaches 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \), we start by analyzing the behavior of the terms in the sum \( a_n \).

1. **Approximation of Terms**:
   Each term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \) can be approximated using the expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x \) for small \( x \). This gives:
   \[
   \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \approx \frac{k}{n^2}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2}
   \]

2. **Sum Approximation**:
   The sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by considering the behavior of \( e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For large \( n \), we approximate the sum by an integral:
   \[
   a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \approx n \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc
   \]
   where \( c = k/n \). The integral \( \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc \) is a constant, leading to \( a_n \approx C n \) for some constant \( C \).

3. **Logarithm and Limit Analysis**:
   Taking the logarithm of \( a_n \):
   \[
   \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n)
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) = 0 \implies L = e^0 = 1
   \]

4. **Squeeze Theorem**:
   Using bounds for \( a_n \):
   \[
   e \leq a_n \leq n e
   \]
   Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):
   \[
   (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2}
   \]
   Both bounds approach 1 as \( n \to \infty \), confirming the limit by the squeeze theorem.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what&#x27;s given. The term \( a_n \) is a sum from \( k=1 \) to \( n \) of \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Then we need to take the inverse of \( a_n \), raise it to the power of \( 1/n^2 \), and find the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity.

Since the limit involves \( n \) in both the exponent and the sum, maybe I need to analyze the behavior of each term in the sum as \( n \) becomes very large. Then, perhaps the entire sum \( a_n \) can be approximated, and from there, we can take the limit.

Let me start by looking at the general term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). For fixed \( k \), as \( n \) becomes large, \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) becomes very small. However, since \( k \) ranges up to \( n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) is \( \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which also tends to zero as \( n \) grows. So each term in the sum is of the form \( (1 + \text{something small})^{\text{something}} \). Maybe I can use the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) when \( x \) is small. Let me check if that applies here.

If \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \) and \( y = k \), then \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). So perhaps \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \approx e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \). However, the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) is valid when \( x \) is small and \( xy \) is also small? Wait, for fixed \( k \), as \( n \to \infty \), \( x \) is small and \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \) is also small, so the approximation might work. But when \( k \) is comparable to \( n \), say \( k \approx n \), then \( xy = \frac{n^2}{n^2} = 1 \), so in that case, \( x = \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which is small, but \( xy = 1 \), so the approximation might not be so accurate. Hmm, so maybe the terms where \( k \) is small contribute \( e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \), and the terms where \( k \) is large (like near \( n \)) might need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the logarithm of \( a_n \) to turn the product into a sum? Wait, but \( a_n \) is already a sum. Taking logarithm might not help directly. However, since we have \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), taking the logarithm would turn this into \( -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \). So maybe I can compute the limit of \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), and then exponentiate the negative of that limit. Let&#x27;s see.

Let me denote \( L = \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \). Taking natural logarithm on both sides, we have:

\( \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \).

Therefore, if I can compute \( \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), then \( L = e^{- \text{that limit}} \).

So the key is to find the asymptotic behavior of \( \ln(a_n) \) as \( n \to \infty \), specifically its leading term divided by \( n^2 \).

To compute \( \ln(a_n) \), note that \( a_n \) is a sum of terms \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). The logarithm of a sum is tricky, but maybe the sum is dominated by its largest term? If that&#x27;s the case, then \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(\text{largest term}) \). Let&#x27;s check if that&#x27;s true here.

The terms in the sum \( a_n \) are \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s see how \( T_k \) behaves as \( n \to \infty \) for different ranges of \( k \).

Case 1: \( k \) is small compared to \( n \), say \( k = o(n) \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right)^k \approx 1 + o\left( \frac{k}{n} \right) \approx 1 \). So these terms are approximately 1.

Case 2: \( k \) is proportional to \( n \), say \( k = cn \) where \( c \) is a constant between 0 and 1. Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{c}{n} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c} \) as \( n \to \infty \), since \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^n \approx e^{c} \). Wait, but here the exponent is \( cn \), so \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \). Wait, actually:

Let me recall that \( \left(1 + \frac{a}{n} \right)^{bn} \approx e^{ab} \) as \( n \to \infty \). So here \( a = c \) and \( b = c \), so it&#x27;s \( e^{c^2} \). So \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \).

Case 3: \( k \) is near \( n \), say \( k = n - m \) for some fixed \( m \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{n - m}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \approx \frac{1}{n} \). Then \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \right)^{n - m} \approx \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n} \approx e \). So even for \( k \) near \( n \), the term \( T_k \) is roughly \( e \).

Wait, but if \( k = n \), then \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \). So the largest term in the sum is approximately \( e \), and other terms when \( k \) is proportional to \( n \) are like \( e^{c^2} \), which for \( c &lt; 1 \), \( c^2 &lt; 1 \), so those terms are smaller than \( e \). Therefore, the term with \( k = n \) is the largest one, approximately \( e \).

However, the sum \( a_n \) has \( n \) terms, each roughly up to \( e \). So if the largest term is \( e \), and there are \( n \) terms, then maybe the sum \( a_n \) is approximately \( n \times e \), but that might be an overestimate because most terms are smaller than \( e \). Wait, but when \( k \) is about \( cn \), then \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \), and as \( c \) goes from 0 to 1, \( e^{c^2} \) goes from 1 to \( e \). So the terms increase from 1 to \( e \). So the sum might be approximated by an integral over \( c \) from 0 to 1 of \( e^{c^2} \) multiplied by \( n \), since there are \( n \) terms each spaced by \( 1/n \).

Wait, maybe we can approximate the sum by an integral. Let me consider replacing the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n T_k \) with an integral over \( k \). Let me set \( c = k/n \), so that \( k = cn \), and \( dk = n \, dc \). Then, as \( n \to \infty \), the sum becomes approximately \( n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{cn}{n^2} \right)^{cn} \, dc = n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \, dc \).

Now, \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \), similar to before. Therefore, the integral becomes \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \). But wait, that would mean \( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \), which is \( n \times \text{some constant} \). However, this contradicts the earlier thought that the largest term is \( e \), but maybe the integral accounts for all terms. Wait, but integrating \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is a constant, so the sum would be approximately \( C n \), so \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C n) = \ln C + \ln n \). Then \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln C + \ln n}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \). But I feel like this might not be correct because I approximated the sum as \( Cn \), but maybe there&#x27;s a more precise estimation needed.

Alternatively, maybe the sum \( a_n \) is dominated by its last term \( T_n \approx e \), so \( a_n \approx e \), but that seems incorrect because there are \( n \) terms each contributing at least 1, so the sum is at least \( n \). But \( e \) is much smaller than \( n \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, this must not be the case.

Wait, there&#x27;s a contradiction here. If the largest term is \( e \), but there are \( n \) terms each contributing around 1 or more, then the sum must be at least \( n \), which tends to infinity. But then, if \( a_n \) is growing without bound, the limit \( \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would be \( 1 \), since any term growing to infinity raised to the power of \( -1/n^2 \) would tend to 1. Wait, but is that necessarily the case?

Let me think. Suppose \( a_n \) grows exponentially, say \( a_n \approx e^{n} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-n /n^2} = e^{-1/n} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows polynomially, say \( a_n \approx n^c \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-c \ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows like \( e^{n^2} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-1} \). So the key is to determine the growth rate of \( a_n \).

Therefore, to compute \( L = \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), we need to know whether \( a_n \) grows exponentially, polynomially, or otherwise. The answer hinges on the asymptotic behavior of \( a_n \).

Earlier, I thought that the sum \( a_n \) could be approximated by an integral leading to \( Cn \), but that would mean \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). However, perhaps my integral approximation is missing something?

Wait, let&#x27;s reconsider the approximation for \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s take the logarithm of \( T_k \):

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Using the Taylor expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \cdots \), we can expand this as:

\( \ln T_k \approx k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \).

Therefore, exponentiating, we have:

\( T_k \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \).

So for terms where \( k \) is small compared to \( n^{4/3} \), the correction term \( \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \) is negligible, so \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For larger \( k \), the approximation might break down, but if the dominant contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \) is not too large, maybe this is okay.

Therefore, maybe \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \). Let&#x27;s analyze this sum.

Again, let&#x27;s make a substitution \( c = k/n \), so \( k = cn \), \( c \in (0, 1] \). Then, \( e^{k^2 / n^2} = e^{c^2} \). The sum becomes approximately \( \sum_{c=1/n}^{1} e^{c^2} \cdot n \, dc \), which is similar to an integral. So:

\( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \).

But the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Then, \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \), so \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

But wait, the problem is that this approximation might not capture the true behavior of \( a_n \). If \( a_n \) is indeed growing linearly, then the limit is 1. However, perhaps the actual growth of \( a_n \) is faster than linear? Let&#x27;s check for specific values.

Take \( n = 2 \):

\( a_2 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{4}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{14}{4} = 3.5 \).

For \( n = 3 \):

\( a_3 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{9}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{9}\right)^2 + \left(1 + \frac{3}{9}\right)^3 \approx 1.1111 + (1.2222)^2 + (1.3333)^3 \approx 1.1111 + 1.4938 + 2.3704 \approx 4.9753 \).

For \( n = 10 \), it&#x27;s tedious to compute, but maybe we can see the trend. As \( n \) increases, each term \( T_k \) for \( k \) up to \( n \) is increasing from 1 to approximately \( e \). However, the number of terms is increasing as well. If each term is roughly \( e^{c^2} \), then the sum is like a Riemann sum for \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \times n \), which does grow linearly with \( n \).

But let&#x27;s check for \( n = 100 \). If \( a_{100} \approx 100 \times \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \approx 100 \times 1.46265 \approx 146.265 \). If we compute \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \), since \( 1/10000 \) is a very small exponent, the result should be very close to 1. Similarly, as \( n \) increases, \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(a_n)/n^2} \approx e^{- (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 } \approx 1 - (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 \), which tends to 1.

But the problem is that maybe the initial approximation where \( T_k \approx e^{k^2/n^2} \) is too crude. Let&#x27;s re-examine the term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \).

Taking the natural logarithm:

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Expanding the logarithm as a Taylor series:

\( \ln(1 + x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots \).

Here, \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \), so:

\( \ln T_k = k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \frac{k^3}{3n^6} - \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \frac{k^4}{3n^6} - \cdots \).

Therefore, the leading term is \( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). If we exponentiate this, we get:

\( T_k = \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \).

So the correction term is \( - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \). For the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \) to be valid, we need the next term \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) to be negligible compared to 1.

So \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \ll 1 \). For \( k \leq n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) is \( \frac{n^3}{n^4} = \frac{1}{n} \), which tends to 0 as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, even for the largest \( k = n \), the correction term is \( \frac{n^3}{2n^4} = \frac{1}{2n} \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is valid for all \( k \leq n \).

Therefore, the entire sum \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \).

Now, let&#x27;s analyze this sum. Let me make a substitution \( x = k/n \), so \( k = xn \), and \( x \) ranges from \( 1/n \) to 1 in increments of \( 1/n \). Then, \( e^{k^2 /n^2} = e^{x^2} \). The sum becomes:

\( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{x^2} \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

This is a Riemann sum approximation. The sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{(k/n)^2} \cdot \frac{1}{n} \approx \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \). Therefore, multiplying by \( n \), the original sum is approximately \( n \cdot \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

But wait, the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, the sum \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Therefore, \( \ln a_n \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \).

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln n}{n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( \ln n / n^2 \) and \( \ln C / n^2 \) tend to 0. Therefore, the limit is 0, so \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), which implies \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

However, this contradicts my earlier thought that maybe there&#x27;s a term contributing more significantly. Wait, but according to this Riemann sum approximation, the sum \( a_n \) grows linearly with \( n \). Therefore, \( a_n \) ~ \( C n \), so the inverse \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) is \( (C n)^{-1/n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( C^{-1/n^2} \) and \( n^{-1/n^2} \) approach 1, since any constant raised to the power \( -1/n^2 \) tends to 1, and \( n^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \).

Therefore, according to this reasoning, the limit should be 1. However, I recall that in some similar problems, even if the sum grows linearly, the limit might not be 1 due to more precise exponential terms. But in this case, since we&#x27;re taking the \( -1/n^2 \) power, which decays to zero, any polynomial growth in \( a_n \) would lead to the limit being 1. For example, if \( a_n = n \), then \( (n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). Similarly, if \( a_n = e^{o(n^2)} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). So unless \( a_n \) has a term like \( e^{n^2} \), the limit is 1.

But according to the previous analysis, the sum \( a_n \) is approximated by \( C n \), so the limit is 1. But maybe the approximation is missing an exponential term? Let me check with a different approach.

Alternative approach: Find the dominant term in the sum \( a_n \). Since each term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \), as we established earlier, the terms increase as \( k \) increases because \( e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is an increasing function of \( k \). Therefore, the last term \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2}\right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n \approx e \). The term before the last is \( T_{n-1} = \left(1 + \frac{n - 1}{n^2}\right)^{n - 1} \approx e^{(n - 1)^2 /n^2} \approx e^{1 - 2/n + 1/n^2} \approx e \cdot e^{-2/n} \approx e (1 - 2/n) \).

So the largest terms are approaching \( e \), and the terms near \( k = n \) are approximately \( e \). However, there are about \( n \) terms, each roughly of order up to \( e \). But if most terms are much smaller than \( e \), the sum might still be dominated by the last few terms. Wait, but how much do the terms near \( k = n \) contribute?

Suppose we consider the last \( m \) terms, where \( m \) is some fixed number. Each of these terms is approximately \( e \), so their total contribution is \( m e \). The rest of the terms (there are \( n - m \) of them) are smaller. If \( m \) is fixed, then as \( n \to \infty \), the sum \( a_n \) would be \( m e + o(n) \). But if \( m \) is allowed to grow with \( n \), say \( m = \sqrt{n} \), then the contribution would be \( \sqrt{n} e \), which is still \( o(n) \). Therefore, perhaps the sum is still dominated by the bulk of the terms rather than the last few.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by the integral \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \), as before, leading to linear growth. Let me compute \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \). The integral of \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is known as the imaginary error function, but its approximate value is indeed around 1.46265. So multiplying by \( n \), \( a_n \approx 1.46265 n \).

Therefore, \( a_n \) is roughly proportional to \( n \), so \( \ln a_n \approx \ln n + \ln(1.46265) \). Then, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln n}{n^2} + \frac{\ln(1.46265)}{n^2} \), both terms go to zero. Hence, \( \ln L = 0 \implies L = 1 \).

But let&#x27;s test this with numerical examples for small \( n \):

For \( n = 1 \), \( a_1 = (1 + 1/1^2)^1 = 2 \), so \( (a_1)^{-1/1^2} = 1/2 \).

For \( n = 2 \), \( a_2 = (1 + 1/4)^1 + (1 + 2/4)^2 = 5/4 + (3/2)^2 = 5/4 + 9/4 = 14/4 = 3.5 \), so \( (3.5)^{-1/4} \approx 0.645 \).

For \( n = 3 \), \( a_3 \approx 4.9753 \), so \( (4.9753)^{-1/9} \approx e^{-\ln(4.9753)/9} \approx e^{-1.606/9} \approx e^{-0.178} \approx 0.837 \).

For \( n = 10 \), if \( a_{10} \approx 10 \times 1.46265 \approx 14.6265 \), then \( (14.6265)^{-1/100} \approx e^{-\ln(14.6265)/100} \approx e^{-2.683/100} \approx e^{-0.02683} \approx 0.9736 \).

For \( n = 100 \), \( a_{100} \approx 146.265 \), so \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \approx e^{-\ln(146.265)/10000} \approx e^{-4.986/10000} \approx e^{-0.0004986} \approx 0.9995 \).

So as \( n \) increases, \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) seems to approach 1 from below. Therefore, the numerical evidence supports the analytical conclusion that the limit is 1.

However, I need to be careful here. The numerical examples for small \( n \) are not conclusive, but as \( n \) increases, the trend is clearly approaching 1. Hence, it&#x27;s reasonable to conclude that the limit is indeed 1.

But wait, let me consider another perspective. Suppose there exists a term in the sum \( a_n \) that grows exponentially with \( n^2 \), then \( a_n \) would be dominated by that term, and \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would tend to a value less than 1. But according to our analysis, all terms \( T_k \) are at most \( e \), and their sum grows linearly. So there&#x27;s no such term here. Therefore, the conclusion remains that the limit is 1.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider the possibility that the main contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \approx \sqrt{n} \). Wait, but why would that be? For \( k = \sqrt{n} \), \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \right)^{\sqrt{n}} \approx e^{\sqrt{n}/n^{3/2}} = e^{1/n} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{n} \). So these terms are close to 1. Therefore, such terms don&#x27;t contribute significantly.

Another angle: Let&#x27;s consider using the AM-GM inequality on the terms of the sum. The geometric mean of the terms is \( \left( \prod_{k=1}^n T_k \right)^{1/n} \leq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n T_k = \frac{a_n}{n} \). But I&#x27;m not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, note that since \( a_n \geq T_n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \), and \( a_n \leq n \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = n \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx n e \). Therefore, \( e \leq a_n \leq n e \). Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):

\( (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2} \).

Compute the limits of the bounds. The upper bound \( e^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \) as \( n \to \infty \). The lower bound \( (n e)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(n e)/n^2} = e^{-(\ln n + 1)/n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \). Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the limit is 1.

This is a solid argument. Since \( a_n \) is sandwiched between \( e \) and \( n e \), both of which raised to \( -1/n^2 \) tend to 1, so the limit must be 1.

Therefore, after considering various approaches—approximating the sum by an integral, analyzing individual terms, using inequalities—it seems consistent that the limit is 1. The key realization is that \( a_n \) grows polynomially (linearly) with \( n \), and thus \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) approaches 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \), we start by analyzing the behavior of the terms in the sum \( a_n \).

1. **Approximation of Terms**:
   Each term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \) can be approximated using the expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x \) for small \( x \). This gives:
   \[
   \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \approx \frac{k}{n^2}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2}
   \]

2. **Sum Approximation**:
   The sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by considering the behavior of \( e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For large \( n \), we approximate the sum by an integral:
   \[
   a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \approx n \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc
   \]
   where \( c = k/n \). The integral \( \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc \) is a constant, leading to \( a_n \approx C n \) for some constant \( C \).

3. **Logarithm and Limit Analysis**:
   Taking the logarithm of \( a_n \):
   \[
   \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n)
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) = 0 \implies L = e^0 = 1
   \]

4. **Squeeze Theorem**:
   Using bounds for \( a_n \):
   \[
   e \leq a_n \leq n e
   \]
   Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):
   \[
   (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2}
   \]
   Both bounds approach 1 as \( n \to \infty \), confirming the limit by the squeeze theorem.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what&#x27;s given. The term \( a_n \) is a sum from \( k=1 \) to \( n \) of \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Then we need to take the inverse of \( a_n \), raise it to the power of \( 1/n^2 \), and find the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity.

Since the limit involves \( n \) in both the exponent and the sum, maybe I need to analyze the behavior of each term in the sum as \( n \) becomes very large. Then, perhaps the entire sum \( a_n \) can be approximated, and from there, we can take the limit.

Let me start by looking at the general term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). For fixed \( k \), as \( n \) becomes large, \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) becomes very small. However, since \( k \) ranges up to \( n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) is \( \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which also tends to zero as \( n \) grows. So each term in the sum is of the form \( (1 + \text{something small})^{\text{something}} \). Maybe I can use the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) when \( x \) is small. Let me check if that applies here.

If \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \) and \( y = k \), then \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). So perhaps \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \approx e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \). However, the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) is valid when \( x \) is small and \( xy \) is also small? Wait, for fixed \( k \), as \( n \to \infty \), \( x \) is small and \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \) is also small, so the approximation might work. But when \( k \) is comparable to \( n \), say \( k \approx n \), then \( xy = \frac{n^2}{n^2} = 1 \), so in that case, \( x = \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which is small, but \( xy = 1 \), so the approximation might not be so accurate. Hmm, so maybe the terms where \( k \) is small contribute \( e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \), and the terms where \( k \) is large (like near \( n \)) might need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the logarithm of \( a_n \) to turn the product into a sum? Wait, but \( a_n \) is already a sum. Taking logarithm might not help directly. However, since we have \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), taking the logarithm would turn this into \( -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \). So maybe I can compute the limit of \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), and then exponentiate the negative of that limit. Let&#x27;s see.

Let me denote \( L = \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \). Taking natural logarithm on both sides, we have:

\( \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \).

Therefore, if I can compute \( \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), then \( L = e^{- \text{that limit}} \).

So the key is to find the asymptotic behavior of \( \ln(a_n) \) as \( n \to \infty \), specifically its leading term divided by \( n^2 \).

To compute \( \ln(a_n) \), note that \( a_n \) is a sum of terms \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). The logarithm of a sum is tricky, but maybe the sum is dominated by its largest term? If that&#x27;s the case, then \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(\text{largest term}) \). Let&#x27;s check if that&#x27;s true here.

The terms in the sum \( a_n \) are \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s see how \( T_k \) behaves as \( n \to \infty \) for different ranges of \( k \).

Case 1: \( k \) is small compared to \( n \), say \( k = o(n) \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right)^k \approx 1 + o\left( \frac{k}{n} \right) \approx 1 \). So these terms are approximately 1.

Case 2: \( k \) is proportional to \( n \), say \( k = cn \) where \( c \) is a constant between 0 and 1. Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{c}{n} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c} \) as \( n \to \infty \), since \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^n \approx e^{c} \). Wait, but here the exponent is \( cn \), so \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \). Wait, actually:

Let me recall that \( \left(1 + \frac{a}{n} \right)^{bn} \approx e^{ab} \) as \( n \to \infty \). So here \( a = c \) and \( b = c \), so it&#x27;s \( e^{c^2} \). So \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \).

Case 3: \( k \) is near \( n \), say \( k = n - m \) for some fixed \( m \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{n - m}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \approx \frac{1}{n} \). Then \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \right)^{n - m} \approx \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n} \approx e \). So even for \( k \) near \( n \), the term \( T_k \) is roughly \( e \).

Wait, but if \( k = n \), then \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \). So the largest term in the sum is approximately \( e \), and other terms when \( k \) is proportional to \( n \) are like \( e^{c^2} \), which for \( c &lt; 1 \), \( c^2 &lt; 1 \), so those terms are smaller than \( e \). Therefore, the term with \( k = n \) is the largest one, approximately \( e \).

However, the sum \( a_n \) has \( n \) terms, each roughly up to \( e \). So if the largest term is \( e \), and there are \( n \) terms, then maybe the sum \( a_n \) is approximately \( n \times e \), but that might be an overestimate because most terms are smaller than \( e \). Wait, but when \( k \) is about \( cn \), then \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \), and as \( c \) goes from 0 to 1, \( e^{c^2} \) goes from 1 to \( e \). So the terms increase from 1 to \( e \). So the sum might be approximated by an integral over \( c \) from 0 to 1 of \( e^{c^2} \) multiplied by \( n \), since there are \( n \) terms each spaced by \( 1/n \).

Wait, maybe we can approximate the sum by an integral. Let me consider replacing the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n T_k \) with an integral over \( k \). Let me set \( c = k/n \), so that \( k = cn \), and \( dk = n \, dc \). Then, as \( n \to \infty \), the sum becomes approximately \( n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{cn}{n^2} \right)^{cn} \, dc = n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \, dc \).

Now, \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \), similar to before. Therefore, the integral becomes \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \). But wait, that would mean \( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \), which is \( n \times \text{some constant} \). However, this contradicts the earlier thought that the largest term is \( e \), but maybe the integral accounts for all terms. Wait, but integrating \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is a constant, so the sum would be approximately \( C n \), so \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C n) = \ln C + \ln n \). Then \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln C + \ln n}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \). But I feel like this might not be correct because I approximated the sum as \( Cn \), but maybe there&#x27;s a more precise estimation needed.

Alternatively, maybe the sum \( a_n \) is dominated by its last term \( T_n \approx e \), so \( a_n \approx e \), but that seems incorrect because there are \( n \) terms each contributing at least 1, so the sum is at least \( n \). But \( e \) is much smaller than \( n \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, this must not be the case.

Wait, there&#x27;s a contradiction here. If the largest term is \( e \), but there are \( n \) terms each contributing around 1 or more, then the sum must be at least \( n \), which tends to infinity. But then, if \( a_n \) is growing without bound, the limit \( \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would be \( 1 \), since any term growing to infinity raised to the power of \( -1/n^2 \) would tend to 1. Wait, but is that necessarily the case?

Let me think. Suppose \( a_n \) grows exponentially, say \( a_n \approx e^{n} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-n /n^2} = e^{-1/n} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows polynomially, say \( a_n \approx n^c \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-c \ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows like \( e^{n^2} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-1} \). So the key is to determine the growth rate of \( a_n \).

Therefore, to compute \( L = \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), we need to know whether \( a_n \) grows exponentially, polynomially, or otherwise. The answer hinges on the asymptotic behavior of \( a_n \).

Earlier, I thought that the sum \( a_n \) could be approximated by an integral leading to \( Cn \), but that would mean \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). However, perhaps my integral approximation is missing something?

Wait, let&#x27;s reconsider the approximation for \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s take the logarithm of \( T_k \):

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Using the Taylor expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \cdots \), we can expand this as:

\( \ln T_k \approx k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \).

Therefore, exponentiating, we have:

\( T_k \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \).

So for terms where \( k \) is small compared to \( n^{4/3} \), the correction term \( \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \) is negligible, so \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For larger \( k \), the approximation might break down, but if the dominant contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \) is not too large, maybe this is okay.

Therefore, maybe \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \). Let&#x27;s analyze this sum.

Again, let&#x27;s make a substitution \( c = k/n \), so \( k = cn \), \( c \in (0, 1] \). Then, \( e^{k^2 / n^2} = e^{c^2} \). The sum becomes approximately \( \sum_{c=1/n}^{1} e^{c^2} \cdot n \, dc \), which is similar to an integral. So:

\( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \).

But the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Then, \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \), so \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

But wait, the problem is that this approximation might not capture the true behavior of \( a_n \). If \( a_n \) is indeed growing linearly, then the limit is 1. However, perhaps the actual growth of \( a_n \) is faster than linear? Let&#x27;s check for specific values.

Take \( n = 2 \):

\( a_2 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{4}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{14}{4} = 3.5 \).

For \( n = 3 \):

\( a_3 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{9}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{9}\right)^2 + \left(1 + \frac{3}{9}\right)^3 \approx 1.1111 + (1.2222)^2 + (1.3333)^3 \approx 1.1111 + 1.4938 + 2.3704 \approx 4.9753 \).

For \( n = 10 \), it&#x27;s tedious to compute, but maybe we can see the trend. As \( n \) increases, each term \( T_k \) for \( k \) up to \( n \) is increasing from 1 to approximately \( e \). However, the number of terms is increasing as well. If each term is roughly \( e^{c^2} \), then the sum is like a Riemann sum for \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \times n \), which does grow linearly with \( n \).

But let&#x27;s check for \( n = 100 \). If \( a_{100} \approx 100 \times \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \approx 100 \times 1.46265 \approx 146.265 \). If we compute \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \), since \( 1/10000 \) is a very small exponent, the result should be very close to 1. Similarly, as \( n \) increases, \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(a_n)/n^2} \approx e^{- (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 } \approx 1 - (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 \), which tends to 1.

But the problem is that maybe the initial approximation where \( T_k \approx e^{k^2/n^2} \) is too crude. Let&#x27;s re-examine the term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \).

Taking the natural logarithm:

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Expanding the logarithm as a Taylor series:

\( \ln(1 + x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots \).

Here, \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \), so:

\( \ln T_k = k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \frac{k^3}{3n^6} - \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \frac{k^4}{3n^6} - \cdots \).

Therefore, the leading term is \( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). If we exponentiate this, we get:

\( T_k = \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \).

So the correction term is \( - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \). For the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \) to be valid, we need the next term \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) to be negligible compared to 1.

So \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \ll 1 \). For \( k \leq n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) is \( \frac{n^3}{n^4} = \frac{1}{n} \), which tends to 0 as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, even for the largest \( k = n \), the correction term is \( \frac{n^3}{2n^4} = \frac{1}{2n} \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is valid for all \( k \leq n \).

Therefore, the entire sum \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \).

Now, let&#x27;s analyze this sum. Let me make a substitution \( x = k/n \), so \( k = xn \), and \( x \) ranges from \( 1/n \) to 1 in increments of \( 1/n \). Then, \( e^{k^2 /n^2} = e^{x^2} \). The sum becomes:

\( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{x^2} \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

This is a Riemann sum approximation. The sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{(k/n)^2} \cdot \frac{1}{n} \approx \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \). Therefore, multiplying by \( n \), the original sum is approximately \( n \cdot \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

But wait, the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, the sum \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Therefore, \( \ln a_n \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \).

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln n}{n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( \ln n / n^2 \) and \( \ln C / n^2 \) tend to 0. Therefore, the limit is 0, so \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), which implies \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

However, this contradicts my earlier thought that maybe there&#x27;s a term contributing more significantly. Wait, but according to this Riemann sum approximation, the sum \( a_n \) grows linearly with \( n \). Therefore, \( a_n \) ~ \( C n \), so the inverse \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) is \( (C n)^{-1/n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( C^{-1/n^2} \) and \( n^{-1/n^2} \) approach 1, since any constant raised to the power \( -1/n^2 \) tends to 1, and \( n^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \).

Therefore, according to this reasoning, the limit should be 1. However, I recall that in some similar problems, even if the sum grows linearly, the limit might not be 1 due to more precise exponential terms. But in this case, since we&#x27;re taking the \( -1/n^2 \) power, which decays to zero, any polynomial growth in \( a_n \) would lead to the limit being 1. For example, if \( a_n = n \), then \( (n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). Similarly, if \( a_n = e^{o(n^2)} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). So unless \( a_n \) has a term like \( e^{n^2} \), the limit is 1.

But according to the previous analysis, the sum \( a_n \) is approximated by \( C n \), so the limit is 1. But maybe the approximation is missing an exponential term? Let me check with a different approach.

Alternative approach: Find the dominant term in the sum \( a_n \). Since each term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \), as we established earlier, the terms increase as \( k \) increases because \( e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is an increasing function of \( k \). Therefore, the last term \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2}\right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n \approx e \). The term before the last is \( T_{n-1} = \left(1 + \frac{n - 1}{n^2}\right)^{n - 1} \approx e^{(n - 1)^2 /n^2} \approx e^{1 - 2/n + 1/n^2} \approx e \cdot e^{-2/n} \approx e (1 - 2/n) \).

So the largest terms are approaching \( e \), and the terms near \( k = n \) are approximately \( e \). However, there are about \( n \) terms, each roughly of order up to \( e \). But if most terms are much smaller than \( e \), the sum might still be dominated by the last few terms. Wait, but how much do the terms near \( k = n \) contribute?

Suppose we consider the last \( m \) terms, where \( m \) is some fixed number. Each of these terms is approximately \( e \), so their total contribution is \( m e \). The rest of the terms (there are \( n - m \) of them) are smaller. If \( m \) is fixed, then as \( n \to \infty \), the sum \( a_n \) would be \( m e + o(n) \). But if \( m \) is allowed to grow with \( n \), say \( m = \sqrt{n} \), then the contribution would be \( \sqrt{n} e \), which is still \( o(n) \). Therefore, perhaps the sum is still dominated by the bulk of the terms rather than the last few.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by the integral \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \), as before, leading to linear growth. Let me compute \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \). The integral of \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is known as the imaginary error function, but its approximate value is indeed around 1.46265. So multiplying by \( n \), \( a_n \approx 1.46265 n \).

Therefore, \( a_n \) is roughly proportional to \( n \), so \( \ln a_n \approx \ln n + \ln(1.46265) \). Then, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln n}{n^2} + \frac{\ln(1.46265)}{n^2} \), both terms go to zero. Hence, \( \ln L = 0 \implies L = 1 \).

But let&#x27;s test this with numerical examples for small \( n \):

For \( n = 1 \), \( a_1 = (1 + 1/1^2)^1 = 2 \), so \( (a_1)^{-1/1^2} = 1/2 \).

For \( n = 2 \), \( a_2 = (1 + 1/4)^1 + (1 + 2/4)^2 = 5/4 + (3/2)^2 = 5/4 + 9/4 = 14/4 = 3.5 \), so \( (3.5)^{-1/4} \approx 0.645 \).

For \( n = 3 \), \( a_3 \approx 4.9753 \), so \( (4.9753)^{-1/9} \approx e^{-\ln(4.9753)/9} \approx e^{-1.606/9} \approx e^{-0.178} \approx 0.837 \).

For \( n = 10 \), if \( a_{10} \approx 10 \times 1.46265 \approx 14.6265 \), then \( (14.6265)^{-1/100} \approx e^{-\ln(14.6265)/100} \approx e^{-2.683/100} \approx e^{-0.02683} \approx 0.9736 \).

For \( n = 100 \), \( a_{100} \approx 146.265 \), so \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \approx e^{-\ln(146.265)/10000} \approx e^{-4.986/10000} \approx e^{-0.0004986} \approx 0.9995 \).

So as \( n \) increases, \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) seems to approach 1 from below. Therefore, the numerical evidence supports the analytical conclusion that the limit is 1.

However, I need to be careful here. The numerical examples for small \( n \) are not conclusive, but as \( n \) increases, the trend is clearly approaching 1. Hence, it&#x27;s reasonable to conclude that the limit is indeed 1.

But wait, let me consider another perspective. Suppose there exists a term in the sum \( a_n \) that grows exponentially with \( n^2 \), then \( a_n \) would be dominated by that term, and \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would tend to a value less than 1. But according to our analysis, all terms \( T_k \) are at most \( e \), and their sum grows linearly. So there&#x27;s no such term here. Therefore, the conclusion remains that the limit is 1.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider the possibility that the main contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \approx \sqrt{n} \). Wait, but why would that be? For \( k = \sqrt{n} \), \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \right)^{\sqrt{n}} \approx e^{\sqrt{n}/n^{3/2}} = e^{1/n} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{n} \). So these terms are close to 1. Therefore, such terms don&#x27;t contribute significantly.

Another angle: Let&#x27;s consider using the AM-GM inequality on the terms of the sum. The geometric mean of the terms is \( \left( \prod_{k=1}^n T_k \right)^{1/n} \leq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n T_k = \frac{a_n}{n} \). But I&#x27;m not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, note that since \( a_n \geq T_n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \), and \( a_n \leq n \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = n \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx n e \). Therefore, \( e \leq a_n \leq n e \). Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):

\( (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2} \).

Compute the limits of the bounds. The upper bound \( e^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \) as \( n \to \infty \). The lower bound \( (n e)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(n e)/n^2} = e^{-(\ln n + 1)/n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \). Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the limit is 1.

This is a solid argument. Since \( a_n \) is sandwiched between \( e \) and \( n e \), both of which raised to \( -1/n^2 \) tend to 1, so the limit must be 1.

Therefore, after considering various approaches—approximating the sum by an integral, analyzing individual terms, using inequalities—it seems consistent that the limit is 1. The key realization is that \( a_n \) grows polynomially (linearly) with \( n \), and thus \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) approaches 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \), we start by analyzing the behavior of the terms in the sum \( a_n \).

1. **Approximation of Terms**:
   Each term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \) can be approximated using the expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x \) for small \( x \). This gives:
   \[
   \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \approx \frac{k}{n^2}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2}
   \]

2. **Sum Approximation**:
   The sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by considering the behavior of \( e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For large \( n \), we approximate the sum by an integral:
   \[
   a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \approx n \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc
   \]
   where \( c = k/n \). The integral \( \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc \) is a constant, leading to \( a_n \approx C n \) for some constant \( C \).

3. **Logarithm and Limit Analysis**:
   Taking the logarithm of \( a_n \):
   \[
   \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n)
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) = 0 \implies L = e^0 = 1
   \]

4. **Squeeze Theorem**:
   Using bounds for \( a_n \):
   \[
   e \leq a_n \leq n e
   \]
   Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):
   \[
   (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2}
   \]
   Both bounds approach 1 as \( n \to \infty \), confirming the limit by the squeeze theorem.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what&#x27;s given. The term \( a_n \) is a sum from \( k=1 \) to \( n \) of \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Then we need to take the inverse of \( a_n \), raise it to the power of \( 1/n^2 \), and find the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity.

Since the limit involves \( n \) in both the exponent and the sum, maybe I need to analyze the behavior of each term in the sum as \( n \) becomes very large. Then, perhaps the entire sum \( a_n \) can be approximated, and from there, we can take the limit.

Let me start by looking at the general term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). For fixed \( k \), as \( n \) becomes large, \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) becomes very small. However, since \( k \) ranges up to \( n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) is \( \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which also tends to zero as \( n \) grows. So each term in the sum is of the form \( (1 + \text{something small})^{\text{something}} \). Maybe I can use the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) when \( x \) is small. Let me check if that applies here.

If \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \) and \( y = k \), then \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). So perhaps \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \approx e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \). However, the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) is valid when \( x \) is small and \( xy \) is also small? Wait, for fixed \( k \), as \( n \to \infty \), \( x \) is small and \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \) is also small, so the approximation might work. But when \( k \) is comparable to \( n \), say \( k \approx n \), then \( xy = \frac{n^2}{n^2} = 1 \), so in that case, \( x = \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which is small, but \( xy = 1 \), so the approximation might not be so accurate. Hmm, so maybe the terms where \( k \) is small contribute \( e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \), and the terms where \( k \) is large (like near \( n \)) might need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the logarithm of \( a_n \) to turn the product into a sum? Wait, but \( a_n \) is already a sum. Taking logarithm might not help directly. However, since we have \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), taking the logarithm would turn this into \( -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \). So maybe I can compute the limit of \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), and then exponentiate the negative of that limit. Let&#x27;s see.

Let me denote \( L = \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \). Taking natural logarithm on both sides, we have:

\( \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \).

Therefore, if I can compute \( \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), then \( L = e^{- \text{that limit}} \).

So the key is to find the asymptotic behavior of \( \ln(a_n) \) as \( n \to \infty \), specifically its leading term divided by \( n^2 \).

To compute \( \ln(a_n) \), note that \( a_n \) is a sum of terms \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). The logarithm of a sum is tricky, but maybe the sum is dominated by its largest term? If that&#x27;s the case, then \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(\text{largest term}) \). Let&#x27;s check if that&#x27;s true here.

The terms in the sum \( a_n \) are \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s see how \( T_k \) behaves as \( n \to \infty \) for different ranges of \( k \).

Case 1: \( k \) is small compared to \( n \), say \( k = o(n) \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right)^k \approx 1 + o\left( \frac{k}{n} \right) \approx 1 \). So these terms are approximately 1.

Case 2: \( k \) is proportional to \( n \), say \( k = cn \) where \( c \) is a constant between 0 and 1. Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{c}{n} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c} \) as \( n \to \infty \), since \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^n \approx e^{c} \). Wait, but here the exponent is \( cn \), so \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \). Wait, actually:

Let me recall that \( \left(1 + \frac{a}{n} \right)^{bn} \approx e^{ab} \) as \( n \to \infty \). So here \( a = c \) and \( b = c \), so it&#x27;s \( e^{c^2} \). So \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \).

Case 3: \( k \) is near \( n \), say \( k = n - m \) for some fixed \( m \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{n - m}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \approx \frac{1}{n} \). Then \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \right)^{n - m} \approx \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n} \approx e \). So even for \( k \) near \( n \), the term \( T_k \) is roughly \( e \).

Wait, but if \( k = n \), then \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \). So the largest term in the sum is approximately \( e \), and other terms when \( k \) is proportional to \( n \) are like \( e^{c^2} \), which for \( c &lt; 1 \), \( c^2 &lt; 1 \), so those terms are smaller than \( e \). Therefore, the term with \( k = n \) is the largest one, approximately \( e \).

However, the sum \( a_n \) has \( n \) terms, each roughly up to \( e \). So if the largest term is \( e \), and there are \( n \) terms, then maybe the sum \( a_n \) is approximately \( n \times e \), but that might be an overestimate because most terms are smaller than \( e \). Wait, but when \( k \) is about \( cn \), then \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \), and as \( c \) goes from 0 to 1, \( e^{c^2} \) goes from 1 to \( e \). So the terms increase from 1 to \( e \). So the sum might be approximated by an integral over \( c \) from 0 to 1 of \( e^{c^2} \) multiplied by \( n \), since there are \( n \) terms each spaced by \( 1/n \).

Wait, maybe we can approximate the sum by an integral. Let me consider replacing the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n T_k \) with an integral over \( k \). Let me set \( c = k/n \), so that \( k = cn \), and \( dk = n \, dc \). Then, as \( n \to \infty \), the sum becomes approximately \( n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{cn}{n^2} \right)^{cn} \, dc = n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \, dc \).

Now, \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \), similar to before. Therefore, the integral becomes \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \). But wait, that would mean \( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \), which is \( n \times \text{some constant} \). However, this contradicts the earlier thought that the largest term is \( e \), but maybe the integral accounts for all terms. Wait, but integrating \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is a constant, so the sum would be approximately \( C n \), so \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C n) = \ln C + \ln n \). Then \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln C + \ln n}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \). But I feel like this might not be correct because I approximated the sum as \( Cn \), but maybe there&#x27;s a more precise estimation needed.

Alternatively, maybe the sum \( a_n \) is dominated by its last term \( T_n \approx e \), so \( a_n \approx e \), but that seems incorrect because there are \( n \) terms each contributing at least 1, so the sum is at least \( n \). But \( e \) is much smaller than \( n \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, this must not be the case.

Wait, there&#x27;s a contradiction here. If the largest term is \( e \), but there are \( n \) terms each contributing around 1 or more, then the sum must be at least \( n \), which tends to infinity. But then, if \( a_n \) is growing without bound, the limit \( \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would be \( 1 \), since any term growing to infinity raised to the power of \( -1/n^2 \) would tend to 1. Wait, but is that necessarily the case?

Let me think. Suppose \( a_n \) grows exponentially, say \( a_n \approx e^{n} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-n /n^2} = e^{-1/n} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows polynomially, say \( a_n \approx n^c \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-c \ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows like \( e^{n^2} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-1} \). So the key is to determine the growth rate of \( a_n \).

Therefore, to compute \( L = \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), we need to know whether \( a_n \) grows exponentially, polynomially, or otherwise. The answer hinges on the asymptotic behavior of \( a_n \).

Earlier, I thought that the sum \( a_n \) could be approximated by an integral leading to \( Cn \), but that would mean \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). However, perhaps my integral approximation is missing something?

Wait, let&#x27;s reconsider the approximation for \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s take the logarithm of \( T_k \):

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Using the Taylor expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \cdots \), we can expand this as:

\( \ln T_k \approx k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \).

Therefore, exponentiating, we have:

\( T_k \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \).

So for terms where \( k \) is small compared to \( n^{4/3} \), the correction term \( \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \) is negligible, so \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For larger \( k \), the approximation might break down, but if the dominant contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \) is not too large, maybe this is okay.

Therefore, maybe \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \). Let&#x27;s analyze this sum.

Again, let&#x27;s make a substitution \( c = k/n \), so \( k = cn \), \( c \in (0, 1] \). Then, \( e^{k^2 / n^2} = e^{c^2} \). The sum becomes approximately \( \sum_{c=1/n}^{1} e^{c^2} \cdot n \, dc \), which is similar to an integral. So:

\( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \).

But the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Then, \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \), so \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

But wait, the problem is that this approximation might not capture the true behavior of \( a_n \). If \( a_n \) is indeed growing linearly, then the limit is 1. However, perhaps the actual growth of \( a_n \) is faster than linear? Let&#x27;s check for specific values.

Take \( n = 2 \):

\( a_2 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{4}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{14}{4} = 3.5 \).

For \( n = 3 \):

\( a_3 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{9}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{9}\right)^2 + \left(1 + \frac{3}{9}\right)^3 \approx 1.1111 + (1.2222)^2 + (1.3333)^3 \approx 1.1111 + 1.4938 + 2.3704 \approx 4.9753 \).

For \( n = 10 \), it&#x27;s tedious to compute, but maybe we can see the trend. As \( n \) increases, each term \( T_k \) for \( k \) up to \( n \) is increasing from 1 to approximately \( e \). However, the number of terms is increasing as well. If each term is roughly \( e^{c^2} \), then the sum is like a Riemann sum for \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \times n \), which does grow linearly with \( n \).

But let&#x27;s check for \( n = 100 \). If \( a_{100} \approx 100 \times \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \approx 100 \times 1.46265 \approx 146.265 \). If we compute \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \), since \( 1/10000 \) is a very small exponent, the result should be very close to 1. Similarly, as \( n \) increases, \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(a_n)/n^2} \approx e^{- (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 } \approx 1 - (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 \), which tends to 1.

But the problem is that maybe the initial approximation where \( T_k \approx e^{k^2/n^2} \) is too crude. Let&#x27;s re-examine the term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \).

Taking the natural logarithm:

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Expanding the logarithm as a Taylor series:

\( \ln(1 + x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots \).

Here, \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \), so:

\( \ln T_k = k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \frac{k^3}{3n^6} - \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \frac{k^4}{3n^6} - \cdots \).

Therefore, the leading term is \( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). If we exponentiate this, we get:

\( T_k = \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \).

So the correction term is \( - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \). For the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \) to be valid, we need the next term \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) to be negligible compared to 1.

So \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \ll 1 \). For \( k \leq n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) is \( \frac{n^3}{n^4} = \frac{1}{n} \), which tends to 0 as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, even for the largest \( k = n \), the correction term is \( \frac{n^3}{2n^4} = \frac{1}{2n} \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is valid for all \( k \leq n \).

Therefore, the entire sum \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \).

Now, let&#x27;s analyze this sum. Let me make a substitution \( x = k/n \), so \( k = xn \), and \( x \) ranges from \( 1/n \) to 1 in increments of \( 1/n \). Then, \( e^{k^2 /n^2} = e^{x^2} \). The sum becomes:

\( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{x^2} \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

This is a Riemann sum approximation. The sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{(k/n)^2} \cdot \frac{1}{n} \approx \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \). Therefore, multiplying by \( n \), the original sum is approximately \( n \cdot \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

But wait, the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, the sum \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Therefore, \( \ln a_n \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \).

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln n}{n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( \ln n / n^2 \) and \( \ln C / n^2 \) tend to 0. Therefore, the limit is 0, so \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), which implies \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

However, this contradicts my earlier thought that maybe there&#x27;s a term contributing more significantly. Wait, but according to this Riemann sum approximation, the sum \( a_n \) grows linearly with \( n \). Therefore, \( a_n \) ~ \( C n \), so the inverse \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) is \( (C n)^{-1/n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( C^{-1/n^2} \) and \( n^{-1/n^2} \) approach 1, since any constant raised to the power \( -1/n^2 \) tends to 1, and \( n^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \).

Therefore, according to this reasoning, the limit should be 1. However, I recall that in some similar problems, even if the sum grows linearly, the limit might not be 1 due to more precise exponential terms. But in this case, since we&#x27;re taking the \( -1/n^2 \) power, which decays to zero, any polynomial growth in \( a_n \) would lead to the limit being 1. For example, if \( a_n = n \), then \( (n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). Similarly, if \( a_n = e^{o(n^2)} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). So unless \( a_n \) has a term like \( e^{n^2} \), the limit is 1.

But according to the previous analysis, the sum \( a_n \) is approximated by \( C n \), so the limit is 1. But maybe the approximation is missing an exponential term? Let me check with a different approach.

Alternative approach: Find the dominant term in the sum \( a_n \). Since each term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \), as we established earlier, the terms increase as \( k \) increases because \( e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is an increasing function of \( k \). Therefore, the last term \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2}\right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n \approx e \). The term before the last is \( T_{n-1} = \left(1 + \frac{n - 1}{n^2}\right)^{n - 1} \approx e^{(n - 1)^2 /n^2} \approx e^{1 - 2/n + 1/n^2} \approx e \cdot e^{-2/n} \approx e (1 - 2/n) \).

So the largest terms are approaching \( e \), and the terms near \( k = n \) are approximately \( e \). However, there are about \( n \) terms, each roughly of order up to \( e \). But if most terms are much smaller than \( e \), the sum might still be dominated by the last few terms. Wait, but how much do the terms near \( k = n \) contribute?

Suppose we consider the last \( m \) terms, where \( m \) is some fixed number. Each of these terms is approximately \( e \), so their total contribution is \( m e \). The rest of the terms (there are \( n - m \) of them) are smaller. If \( m \) is fixed, then as \( n \to \infty \), the sum \( a_n \) would be \( m e + o(n) \). But if \( m \) is allowed to grow with \( n \), say \( m = \sqrt{n} \), then the contribution would be \( \sqrt{n} e \), which is still \( o(n) \). Therefore, perhaps the sum is still dominated by the bulk of the terms rather than the last few.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by the integral \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \), as before, leading to linear growth. Let me compute \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \). The integral of \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is known as the imaginary error function, but its approximate value is indeed around 1.46265. So multiplying by \( n \), \( a_n \approx 1.46265 n \).

Therefore, \( a_n \) is roughly proportional to \( n \), so \( \ln a_n \approx \ln n + \ln(1.46265) \). Then, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln n}{n^2} + \frac{\ln(1.46265)}{n^2} \), both terms go to zero. Hence, \( \ln L = 0 \implies L = 1 \).

But let&#x27;s test this with numerical examples for small \( n \):

For \( n = 1 \), \( a_1 = (1 + 1/1^2)^1 = 2 \), so \( (a_1)^{-1/1^2} = 1/2 \).

For \( n = 2 \), \( a_2 = (1 + 1/4)^1 + (1 + 2/4)^2 = 5/4 + (3/2)^2 = 5/4 + 9/4 = 14/4 = 3.5 \), so \( (3.5)^{-1/4} \approx 0.645 \).

For \( n = 3 \), \( a_3 \approx 4.9753 \), so \( (4.9753)^{-1/9} \approx e^{-\ln(4.9753)/9} \approx e^{-1.606/9} \approx e^{-0.178} \approx 0.837 \).

For \( n = 10 \), if \( a_{10} \approx 10 \times 1.46265 \approx 14.6265 \), then \( (14.6265)^{-1/100} \approx e^{-\ln(14.6265)/100} \approx e^{-2.683/100} \approx e^{-0.02683} \approx 0.9736 \).

For \( n = 100 \), \( a_{100} \approx 146.265 \), so \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \approx e^{-\ln(146.265)/10000} \approx e^{-4.986/10000} \approx e^{-0.0004986} \approx 0.9995 \).

So as \( n \) increases, \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) seems to approach 1 from below. Therefore, the numerical evidence supports the analytical conclusion that the limit is 1.

However, I need to be careful here. The numerical examples for small \( n \) are not conclusive, but as \( n \) increases, the trend is clearly approaching 1. Hence, it&#x27;s reasonable to conclude that the limit is indeed 1.

But wait, let me consider another perspective. Suppose there exists a term in the sum \( a_n \) that grows exponentially with \( n^2 \), then \( a_n \) would be dominated by that term, and \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would tend to a value less than 1. But according to our analysis, all terms \( T_k \) are at most \( e \), and their sum grows linearly. So there&#x27;s no such term here. Therefore, the conclusion remains that the limit is 1.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider the possibility that the main contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \approx \sqrt{n} \). Wait, but why would that be? For \( k = \sqrt{n} \), \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \right)^{\sqrt{n}} \approx e^{\sqrt{n}/n^{3/2}} = e^{1/n} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{n} \). So these terms are close to 1. Therefore, such terms don&#x27;t contribute significantly.

Another angle: Let&#x27;s consider using the AM-GM inequality on the terms of the sum. The geometric mean of the terms is \( \left( \prod_{k=1}^n T_k \right)^{1/n} \leq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n T_k = \frac{a_n}{n} \). But I&#x27;m not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, note that since \( a_n \geq T_n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \), and \( a_n \leq n \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = n \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx n e \). Therefore, \( e \leq a_n \leq n e \). Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):

\( (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2} \).

Compute the limits of the bounds. The upper bound \( e^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \) as \( n \to \infty \). The lower bound \( (n e)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(n e)/n^2} = e^{-(\ln n + 1)/n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \). Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the limit is 1.

This is a solid argument. Since \( a_n \) is sandwiched between \( e \) and \( n e \), both of which raised to \( -1/n^2 \) tend to 1, so the limit must be 1.

Therefore, after considering various approaches—approximating the sum by an integral, analyzing individual terms, using inequalities—it seems consistent that the limit is 1. The key realization is that \( a_n \) grows polynomially (linearly) with \( n \), and thus \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) approaches 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \), we start by analyzing the behavior of the terms in the sum \( a_n \).

1. **Approximation of Terms**:
   Each term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \) can be approximated using the expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x \) for small \( x \). This gives:
   \[
   \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \approx \frac{k}{n^2}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2}
   \]

2. **Sum Approximation**:
   The sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by considering the behavior of \( e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For large \( n \), we approximate the sum by an integral:
   \[
   a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \approx n \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc
   \]
   where \( c = k/n \). The integral \( \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc \) is a constant, leading to \( a_n \approx C n \) for some constant \( C \).

3. **Logarithm and Limit Analysis**:
   Taking the logarithm of \( a_n \):
   \[
   \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n)
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) = 0 \implies L = e^0 = 1
   \]

4. **Squeeze Theorem**:
   Using bounds for \( a_n \):
   \[
   e \leq a_n \leq n e
   \]
   Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):
   \[
   (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2}
   \]
   Both bounds approach 1 as \( n \to \infty \), confirming the limit by the squeeze theorem.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what&#x27;s given. The term \( a_n \) is a sum from \( k=1 \) to \( n \) of \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Then we need to take the inverse of \( a_n \), raise it to the power of \( 1/n^2 \), and find the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity.

Since the limit involves \( n \) in both the exponent and the sum, maybe I need to analyze the behavior of each term in the sum as \( n \) becomes very large. Then, perhaps the entire sum \( a_n \) can be approximated, and from there, we can take the limit.

Let me start by looking at the general term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). For fixed \( k \), as \( n \) becomes large, \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) becomes very small. However, since \( k \) ranges up to \( n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) is \( \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which also tends to zero as \( n \) grows. So each term in the sum is of the form \( (1 + \text{something small})^{\text{something}} \). Maybe I can use the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) when \( x \) is small. Let me check if that applies here.

If \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \) and \( y = k \), then \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). So perhaps \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \approx e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \). However, the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) is valid when \( x \) is small and \( xy \) is also small? Wait, for fixed \( k \), as \( n \to \infty \), \( x \) is small and \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \) is also small, so the approximation might work. But when \( k \) is comparable to \( n \), say \( k \approx n \), then \( xy = \frac{n^2}{n^2} = 1 \), so in that case, \( x = \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which is small, but \( xy = 1 \), so the approximation might not be so accurate. Hmm, so maybe the terms where \( k \) is small contribute \( e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \), and the terms where \( k \) is large (like near \( n \)) might need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the logarithm of \( a_n \) to turn the product into a sum? Wait, but \( a_n \) is already a sum. Taking logarithm might not help directly. However, since we have \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), taking the logarithm would turn this into \( -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \). So maybe I can compute the limit of \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), and then exponentiate the negative of that limit. Let&#x27;s see.

Let me denote \( L = \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \). Taking natural logarithm on both sides, we have:

\( \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \).

Therefore, if I can compute \( \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), then \( L = e^{- \text{that limit}} \).

So the key is to find the asymptotic behavior of \( \ln(a_n) \) as \( n \to \infty \), specifically its leading term divided by \( n^2 \).

To compute \( \ln(a_n) \), note that \( a_n \) is a sum of terms \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). The logarithm of a sum is tricky, but maybe the sum is dominated by its largest term? If that&#x27;s the case, then \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(\text{largest term}) \). Let&#x27;s check if that&#x27;s true here.

The terms in the sum \( a_n \) are \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s see how \( T_k \) behaves as \( n \to \infty \) for different ranges of \( k \).

Case 1: \( k \) is small compared to \( n \), say \( k = o(n) \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right)^k \approx 1 + o\left( \frac{k}{n} \right) \approx 1 \). So these terms are approximately 1.

Case 2: \( k \) is proportional to \( n \), say \( k = cn \) where \( c \) is a constant between 0 and 1. Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{c}{n} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c} \) as \( n \to \infty \), since \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^n \approx e^{c} \). Wait, but here the exponent is \( cn \), so \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \). Wait, actually:

Let me recall that \( \left(1 + \frac{a}{n} \right)^{bn} \approx e^{ab} \) as \( n \to \infty \). So here \( a = c \) and \( b = c \), so it&#x27;s \( e^{c^2} \). So \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \).

Case 3: \( k \) is near \( n \), say \( k = n - m \) for some fixed \( m \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{n - m}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \approx \frac{1}{n} \). Then \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \right)^{n - m} \approx \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n} \approx e \). So even for \( k \) near \( n \), the term \( T_k \) is roughly \( e \).

Wait, but if \( k = n \), then \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \). So the largest term in the sum is approximately \( e \), and other terms when \( k \) is proportional to \( n \) are like \( e^{c^2} \), which for \( c &lt; 1 \), \( c^2 &lt; 1 \), so those terms are smaller than \( e \). Therefore, the term with \( k = n \) is the largest one, approximately \( e \).

However, the sum \( a_n \) has \( n \) terms, each roughly up to \( e \). So if the largest term is \( e \), and there are \( n \) terms, then maybe the sum \( a_n \) is approximately \( n \times e \), but that might be an overestimate because most terms are smaller than \( e \). Wait, but when \( k \) is about \( cn \), then \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \), and as \( c \) goes from 0 to 1, \( e^{c^2} \) goes from 1 to \( e \). So the terms increase from 1 to \( e \). So the sum might be approximated by an integral over \( c \) from 0 to 1 of \( e^{c^2} \) multiplied by \( n \), since there are \( n \) terms each spaced by \( 1/n \).

Wait, maybe we can approximate the sum by an integral. Let me consider replacing the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n T_k \) with an integral over \( k \). Let me set \( c = k/n \), so that \( k = cn \), and \( dk = n \, dc \). Then, as \( n \to \infty \), the sum becomes approximately \( n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{cn}{n^2} \right)^{cn} \, dc = n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \, dc \).

Now, \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \), similar to before. Therefore, the integral becomes \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \). But wait, that would mean \( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \), which is \( n \times \text{some constant} \). However, this contradicts the earlier thought that the largest term is \( e \), but maybe the integral accounts for all terms. Wait, but integrating \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is a constant, so the sum would be approximately \( C n \), so \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C n) = \ln C + \ln n \). Then \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln C + \ln n}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \). But I feel like this might not be correct because I approximated the sum as \( Cn \), but maybe there&#x27;s a more precise estimation needed.

Alternatively, maybe the sum \( a_n \) is dominated by its last term \( T_n \approx e \), so \( a_n \approx e \), but that seems incorrect because there are \( n \) terms each contributing at least 1, so the sum is at least \( n \). But \( e \) is much smaller than \( n \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, this must not be the case.

Wait, there&#x27;s a contradiction here. If the largest term is \( e \), but there are \( n \) terms each contributing around 1 or more, then the sum must be at least \( n \), which tends to infinity. But then, if \( a_n \) is growing without bound, the limit \( \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would be \( 1 \), since any term growing to infinity raised to the power of \( -1/n^2 \) would tend to 1. Wait, but is that necessarily the case?

Let me think. Suppose \( a_n \) grows exponentially, say \( a_n \approx e^{n} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-n /n^2} = e^{-1/n} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows polynomially, say \( a_n \approx n^c \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-c \ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows like \( e^{n^2} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-1} \). So the key is to determine the growth rate of \( a_n \).

Therefore, to compute \( L = \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), we need to know whether \( a_n \) grows exponentially, polynomially, or otherwise. The answer hinges on the asymptotic behavior of \( a_n \).

Earlier, I thought that the sum \( a_n \) could be approximated by an integral leading to \( Cn \), but that would mean \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). However, perhaps my integral approximation is missing something?

Wait, let&#x27;s reconsider the approximation for \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s take the logarithm of \( T_k \):

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Using the Taylor expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \cdots \), we can expand this as:

\( \ln T_k \approx k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \).

Therefore, exponentiating, we have:

\( T_k \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \).

So for terms where \( k \) is small compared to \( n^{4/3} \), the correction term \( \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \) is negligible, so \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For larger \( k \), the approximation might break down, but if the dominant contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \) is not too large, maybe this is okay.

Therefore, maybe \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \). Let&#x27;s analyze this sum.

Again, let&#x27;s make a substitution \( c = k/n \), so \( k = cn \), \( c \in (0, 1] \). Then, \( e^{k^2 / n^2} = e^{c^2} \). The sum becomes approximately \( \sum_{c=1/n}^{1} e^{c^2} \cdot n \, dc \), which is similar to an integral. So:

\( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \).

But the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Then, \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \), so \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

But wait, the problem is that this approximation might not capture the true behavior of \( a_n \). If \( a_n \) is indeed growing linearly, then the limit is 1. However, perhaps the actual growth of \( a_n \) is faster than linear? Let&#x27;s check for specific values.

Take \( n = 2 \):

\( a_2 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{4}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{14}{4} = 3.5 \).

For \( n = 3 \):

\( a_3 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{9}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{9}\right)^2 + \left(1 + \frac{3}{9}\right)^3 \approx 1.1111 + (1.2222)^2 + (1.3333)^3 \approx 1.1111 + 1.4938 + 2.3704 \approx 4.9753 \).

For \( n = 10 \), it&#x27;s tedious to compute, but maybe we can see the trend. As \( n \) increases, each term \( T_k \) for \( k \) up to \( n \) is increasing from 1 to approximately \( e \). However, the number of terms is increasing as well. If each term is roughly \( e^{c^2} \), then the sum is like a Riemann sum for \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \times n \), which does grow linearly with \( n \).

But let&#x27;s check for \( n = 100 \). If \( a_{100} \approx 100 \times \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \approx 100 \times 1.46265 \approx 146.265 \). If we compute \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \), since \( 1/10000 \) is a very small exponent, the result should be very close to 1. Similarly, as \( n \) increases, \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(a_n)/n^2} \approx e^{- (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 } \approx 1 - (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 \), which tends to 1.

But the problem is that maybe the initial approximation where \( T_k \approx e^{k^2/n^2} \) is too crude. Let&#x27;s re-examine the term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \).

Taking the natural logarithm:

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Expanding the logarithm as a Taylor series:

\( \ln(1 + x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots \).

Here, \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \), so:

\( \ln T_k = k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \frac{k^3}{3n^6} - \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \frac{k^4}{3n^6} - \cdots \).

Therefore, the leading term is \( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). If we exponentiate this, we get:

\( T_k = \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \).

So the correction term is \( - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \). For the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \) to be valid, we need the next term \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) to be negligible compared to 1.

So \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \ll 1 \). For \( k \leq n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) is \( \frac{n^3}{n^4} = \frac{1}{n} \), which tends to 0 as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, even for the largest \( k = n \), the correction term is \( \frac{n^3}{2n^4} = \frac{1}{2n} \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is valid for all \( k \leq n \).

Therefore, the entire sum \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \).

Now, let&#x27;s analyze this sum. Let me make a substitution \( x = k/n \), so \( k = xn \), and \( x \) ranges from \( 1/n \) to 1 in increments of \( 1/n \). Then, \( e^{k^2 /n^2} = e^{x^2} \). The sum becomes:

\( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{x^2} \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

This is a Riemann sum approximation. The sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{(k/n)^2} \cdot \frac{1}{n} \approx \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \). Therefore, multiplying by \( n \), the original sum is approximately \( n \cdot \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

But wait, the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, the sum \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Therefore, \( \ln a_n \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \).

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln n}{n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( \ln n / n^2 \) and \( \ln C / n^2 \) tend to 0. Therefore, the limit is 0, so \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), which implies \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

However, this contradicts my earlier thought that maybe there&#x27;s a term contributing more significantly. Wait, but according to this Riemann sum approximation, the sum \( a_n \) grows linearly with \( n \). Therefore, \( a_n \) ~ \( C n \), so the inverse \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) is \( (C n)^{-1/n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( C^{-1/n^2} \) and \( n^{-1/n^2} \) approach 1, since any constant raised to the power \( -1/n^2 \) tends to 1, and \( n^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \).

Therefore, according to this reasoning, the limit should be 1. However, I recall that in some similar problems, even if the sum grows linearly, the limit might not be 1 due to more precise exponential terms. But in this case, since we&#x27;re taking the \( -1/n^2 \) power, which decays to zero, any polynomial growth in \( a_n \) would lead to the limit being 1. For example, if \( a_n = n \), then \( (n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). Similarly, if \( a_n = e^{o(n^2)} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). So unless \( a_n \) has a term like \( e^{n^2} \), the limit is 1.

But according to the previous analysis, the sum \( a_n \) is approximated by \( C n \), so the limit is 1. But maybe the approximation is missing an exponential term? Let me check with a different approach.

Alternative approach: Find the dominant term in the sum \( a_n \). Since each term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \), as we established earlier, the terms increase as \( k \) increases because \( e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is an increasing function of \( k \). Therefore, the last term \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2}\right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n \approx e \). The term before the last is \( T_{n-1} = \left(1 + \frac{n - 1}{n^2}\right)^{n - 1} \approx e^{(n - 1)^2 /n^2} \approx e^{1 - 2/n + 1/n^2} \approx e \cdot e^{-2/n} \approx e (1 - 2/n) \).

So the largest terms are approaching \( e \), and the terms near \( k = n \) are approximately \( e \). However, there are about \( n \) terms, each roughly of order up to \( e \). But if most terms are much smaller than \( e \), the sum might still be dominated by the last few terms. Wait, but how much do the terms near \( k = n \) contribute?

Suppose we consider the last \( m \) terms, where \( m \) is some fixed number. Each of these terms is approximately \( e \), so their total contribution is \( m e \). The rest of the terms (there are \( n - m \) of them) are smaller. If \( m \) is fixed, then as \( n \to \infty \), the sum \( a_n \) would be \( m e + o(n) \). But if \( m \) is allowed to grow with \( n \), say \( m = \sqrt{n} \), then the contribution would be \( \sqrt{n} e \), which is still \( o(n) \). Therefore, perhaps the sum is still dominated by the bulk of the terms rather than the last few.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by the integral \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \), as before, leading to linear growth. Let me compute \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \). The integral of \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is known as the imaginary error function, but its approximate value is indeed around 1.46265. So multiplying by \( n \), \( a_n \approx 1.46265 n \).

Therefore, \( a_n \) is roughly proportional to \( n \), so \( \ln a_n \approx \ln n + \ln(1.46265) \). Then, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln n}{n^2} + \frac{\ln(1.46265)}{n^2} \), both terms go to zero. Hence, \( \ln L = 0 \implies L = 1 \).

But let&#x27;s test this with numerical examples for small \( n \):

For \( n = 1 \), \( a_1 = (1 + 1/1^2)^1 = 2 \), so \( (a_1)^{-1/1^2} = 1/2 \).

For \( n = 2 \), \( a_2 = (1 + 1/4)^1 + (1 + 2/4)^2 = 5/4 + (3/2)^2 = 5/4 + 9/4 = 14/4 = 3.5 \), so \( (3.5)^{-1/4} \approx 0.645 \).

For \( n = 3 \), \( a_3 \approx 4.9753 \), so \( (4.9753)^{-1/9} \approx e^{-\ln(4.9753)/9} \approx e^{-1.606/9} \approx e^{-0.178} \approx 0.837 \).

For \( n = 10 \), if \( a_{10} \approx 10 \times 1.46265 \approx 14.6265 \), then \( (14.6265)^{-1/100} \approx e^{-\ln(14.6265)/100} \approx e^{-2.683/100} \approx e^{-0.02683} \approx 0.9736 \).

For \( n = 100 \), \( a_{100} \approx 146.265 \), so \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \approx e^{-\ln(146.265)/10000} \approx e^{-4.986/10000} \approx e^{-0.0004986} \approx 0.9995 \).

So as \( n \) increases, \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) seems to approach 1 from below. Therefore, the numerical evidence supports the analytical conclusion that the limit is 1.

However, I need to be careful here. The numerical examples for small \( n \) are not conclusive, but as \( n \) increases, the trend is clearly approaching 1. Hence, it&#x27;s reasonable to conclude that the limit is indeed 1.

But wait, let me consider another perspective. Suppose there exists a term in the sum \( a_n \) that grows exponentially with \( n^2 \), then \( a_n \) would be dominated by that term, and \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would tend to a value less than 1. But according to our analysis, all terms \( T_k \) are at most \( e \), and their sum grows linearly. So there&#x27;s no such term here. Therefore, the conclusion remains that the limit is 1.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider the possibility that the main contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \approx \sqrt{n} \). Wait, but why would that be? For \( k = \sqrt{n} \), \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \right)^{\sqrt{n}} \approx e^{\sqrt{n}/n^{3/2}} = e^{1/n} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{n} \). So these terms are close to 1. Therefore, such terms don&#x27;t contribute significantly.

Another angle: Let&#x27;s consider using the AM-GM inequality on the terms of the sum. The geometric mean of the terms is \( \left( \prod_{k=1}^n T_k \right)^{1/n} \leq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n T_k = \frac{a_n}{n} \). But I&#x27;m not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, note that since \( a_n \geq T_n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \), and \( a_n \leq n \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = n \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx n e \). Therefore, \( e \leq a_n \leq n e \). Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):

\( (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2} \).

Compute the limits of the bounds. The upper bound \( e^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \) as \( n \to \infty \). The lower bound \( (n e)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(n e)/n^2} = e^{-(\ln n + 1)/n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \). Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the limit is 1.

This is a solid argument. Since \( a_n \) is sandwiched between \( e \) and \( n e \), both of which raised to \( -1/n^2 \) tend to 1, so the limit must be 1.

Therefore, after considering various approaches—approximating the sum by an integral, analyzing individual terms, using inequalities—it seems consistent that the limit is 1. The key realization is that \( a_n \) grows polynomially (linearly) with \( n \), and thus \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) approaches 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \), we start by analyzing the behavior of the terms in the sum \( a_n \).

1. **Approximation of Terms**:
   Each term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \) can be approximated using the expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x \) for small \( x \). This gives:
   \[
   \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \approx \frac{k}{n^2}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2}
   \]

2. **Sum Approximation**:
   The sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by considering the behavior of \( e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For large \( n \), we approximate the sum by an integral:
   \[
   a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \approx n \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc
   \]
   where \( c = k/n \). The integral \( \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc \) is a constant, leading to \( a_n \approx C n \) for some constant \( C \).

3. **Logarithm and Limit Analysis**:
   Taking the logarithm of \( a_n \):
   \[
   \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n)
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) = 0 \implies L = e^0 = 1
   \]

4. **Squeeze Theorem**:
   Using bounds for \( a_n \):
   \[
   e \leq a_n \leq n e
   \]
   Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):
   \[
   (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2}
   \]
   Both bounds approach 1 as \( n \to \infty \), confirming the limit by the squeeze theorem.

Thus, the final answer is:

Problem: Evaluate the limit \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: The approach we used here is to first convert our limit to a ratio and then to try to evaluate the ratio by directly letting \(n\) approach infinity. First, let&#x27;s confirm that this limit has the form \( \frac{1}{n^\alpha} \), where \(\alpha\) is a constant, by dividing the term under the limit by \(n^{-1/2}\) (note that this is our best guess for \(\alpha\), but check that it works). The expression under the limit reduces to:

1/(\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{n}k/n^{2}+ 1)^k\frac{1}{n^{1/2}}.

We rewrite the exponent as the following:

\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{k}{n^{2}} +1\cdot \frac{1}{n^{1/2}} - \displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{n^k/n^{1/2}}.

The second term disappears because the first few terms of the geometric series with ratio \(n^{-1/2}\) are zero. The same argument shows that all terms of the same type cancel out, and we are left with:

1/(\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{n}k/n^{2}+ 1)^k - 1/n^{k} + 1/n^{k+1/2}.

Now, we perform the same operation the denominator. This reduces to:

1/(\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{n}k/n^{2}+ 1)^k - 1/n+ 1/n^{3/2} + 1/k^2/n^{2k}.

Note that [1/k^2/n^{2k}] approaches 0 as \(n\) approaches infinity. Since an expression of the form above is not in the standard form of the limit, we know that there can&#x27;t be an integer for \(\alpha\). This means that \( \alpha\) must be a fractional number - this is awkward mathematically, but what&#x27;s the issue? We are almost always allowed to drop numbers as long as the terms are multiplying the same power of \(n\); since the \(1/n\) and the \(1/n^{2k}\) are both multiplied by \(1/n\), we can reasonably drop them to get our limit into the standard form (\(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}k/n\)): \begin{aligned} \alpha &amp;= \lim_{k/n^3}k/n + \sum_{k=1}^{n}(1/n-k/n)\cdot n +1/n^3 \cdot n + 1/n^3 \cdot n -1/n \cdot n \\ &amp;= \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{k}{n} + \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{-k}{n^2} +\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{n^3} -\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{n} \\ &amp;= 1/2 \\ &amp;\implies \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} &amp;= n \end{aligned}          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what&#x27;s given. The term \( a_n \) is a sum from \( k=1 \) to \( n \) of \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Then we need to take the inverse of \( a_n \), raise it to the power of \( 1/n^2 \), and find the limit as \( n \) approaches infinity.

Since the limit involves \( n \) in both the exponent and the sum, maybe I need to analyze the behavior of each term in the sum as \( n \) becomes very large. Then, perhaps the entire sum \( a_n \) can be approximated, and from there, we can take the limit.

Let me start by looking at the general term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). For fixed \( k \), as \( n \) becomes large, \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) becomes very small. However, since \( k \) ranges up to \( n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k}{n^2} \) is \( \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which also tends to zero as \( n \) grows. So each term in the sum is of the form \( (1 + \text{something small})^{\text{something}} \). Maybe I can use the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) when \( x \) is small. Let me check if that applies here.

If \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \) and \( y = k \), then \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). So perhaps \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \approx e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \). However, the approximation \( (1 + x)^y \approx e^{xy} \) is valid when \( x \) is small and \( xy \) is also small? Wait, for fixed \( k \), as \( n \to \infty \), \( x \) is small and \( xy = \frac{k^2}{n^2} \) is also small, so the approximation might work. But when \( k \) is comparable to \( n \), say \( k \approx n \), then \( xy = \frac{n^2}{n^2} = 1 \), so in that case, \( x = \frac{n}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} \), which is small, but \( xy = 1 \), so the approximation might not be so accurate. Hmm, so maybe the terms where \( k \) is small contribute \( e^{\frac{k^2}{n^2}} \), and the terms where \( k \) is large (like near \( n \)) might need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the logarithm of \( a_n \) to turn the product into a sum? Wait, but \( a_n \) is already a sum. Taking logarithm might not help directly. However, since we have \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), taking the logarithm would turn this into \( -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \). So maybe I can compute the limit of \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), and then exponentiate the negative of that limit. Let&#x27;s see.

Let me denote \( L = \lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \). Taking natural logarithm on both sides, we have:

\( \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \).

Therefore, if I can compute \( \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \), then \( L = e^{- \text{that limit}} \).

So the key is to find the asymptotic behavior of \( \ln(a_n) \) as \( n \to \infty \), specifically its leading term divided by \( n^2 \).

To compute \( \ln(a_n) \), note that \( a_n \) is a sum of terms \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). The logarithm of a sum is tricky, but maybe the sum is dominated by its largest term? If that&#x27;s the case, then \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(\text{largest term}) \). Let&#x27;s check if that&#x27;s true here.

The terms in the sum \( a_n \) are \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s see how \( T_k \) behaves as \( n \to \infty \) for different ranges of \( k \).

Case 1: \( k \) is small compared to \( n \), say \( k = o(n) \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + o\left( \frac{1}{n} \right) \right)^k \approx 1 + o\left( \frac{k}{n} \right) \approx 1 \). So these terms are approximately 1.

Case 2: \( k \) is proportional to \( n \), say \( k = cn \) where \( c \) is a constant between 0 and 1. Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{c}{n} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c} \) as \( n \to \infty \), since \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^n \approx e^{c} \). Wait, but here the exponent is \( cn \), so \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \). Wait, actually:

Let me recall that \( \left(1 + \frac{a}{n} \right)^{bn} \approx e^{ab} \) as \( n \to \infty \). So here \( a = c \) and \( b = c \), so it&#x27;s \( e^{c^2} \). So \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \).

Case 3: \( k \) is near \( n \), say \( k = n - m \) for some fixed \( m \). Then \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{n - m}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \approx \frac{1}{n} \). Then \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{m}{n^2} \right)^{n - m} \approx \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n} \approx e \). So even for \( k \) near \( n \), the term \( T_k \) is roughly \( e \).

Wait, but if \( k = n \), then \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \). So the largest term in the sum is approximately \( e \), and other terms when \( k \) is proportional to \( n \) are like \( e^{c^2} \), which for \( c &lt; 1 \), \( c^2 &lt; 1 \), so those terms are smaller than \( e \). Therefore, the term with \( k = n \) is the largest one, approximately \( e \).

However, the sum \( a_n \) has \( n \) terms, each roughly up to \( e \). So if the largest term is \( e \), and there are \( n \) terms, then maybe the sum \( a_n \) is approximately \( n \times e \), but that might be an overestimate because most terms are smaller than \( e \). Wait, but when \( k \) is about \( cn \), then \( T_k \approx e^{c^2} \), and as \( c \) goes from 0 to 1, \( e^{c^2} \) goes from 1 to \( e \). So the terms increase from 1 to \( e \). So the sum might be approximated by an integral over \( c \) from 0 to 1 of \( e^{c^2} \) multiplied by \( n \), since there are \( n \) terms each spaced by \( 1/n \).

Wait, maybe we can approximate the sum by an integral. Let me consider replacing the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n T_k \) with an integral over \( k \). Let me set \( c = k/n \), so that \( k = cn \), and \( dk = n \, dc \). Then, as \( n \to \infty \), the sum becomes approximately \( n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{cn}{n^2} \right)^{cn} \, dc = n \int_{0}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \, dc \).

Now, \( \left(1 + \frac{c}{n} \right)^{cn} \approx e^{c^2} \), similar to before. Therefore, the integral becomes \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \). But wait, that would mean \( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \), which is \( n \times \text{some constant} \). However, this contradicts the earlier thought that the largest term is \( e \), but maybe the integral accounts for all terms. Wait, but integrating \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is a constant, so the sum would be approximately \( C n \), so \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C n) = \ln C + \ln n \). Then \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln C + \ln n}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \). But I feel like this might not be correct because I approximated the sum as \( Cn \), but maybe there&#x27;s a more precise estimation needed.

Alternatively, maybe the sum \( a_n \) is dominated by its last term \( T_n \approx e \), so \( a_n \approx e \), but that seems incorrect because there are \( n \) terms each contributing at least 1, so the sum is at least \( n \). But \( e \) is much smaller than \( n \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, this must not be the case.

Wait, there&#x27;s a contradiction here. If the largest term is \( e \), but there are \( n \) terms each contributing around 1 or more, then the sum must be at least \( n \), which tends to infinity. But then, if \( a_n \) is growing without bound, the limit \( \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would be \( 1 \), since any term growing to infinity raised to the power of \( -1/n^2 \) would tend to 1. Wait, but is that necessarily the case?

Let me think. Suppose \( a_n \) grows exponentially, say \( a_n \approx e^{n} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-n /n^2} = e^{-1/n} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows polynomially, say \( a_n \approx n^c \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-c \ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). If \( a_n \) grows like \( e^{n^2} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-1} \). So the key is to determine the growth rate of \( a_n \).

Therefore, to compute \( L = \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), we need to know whether \( a_n \) grows exponentially, polynomially, or otherwise. The answer hinges on the asymptotic behavior of \( a_n \).

Earlier, I thought that the sum \( a_n \) could be approximated by an integral leading to \( Cn \), but that would mean \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). However, perhaps my integral approximation is missing something?

Wait, let&#x27;s reconsider the approximation for \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \). Let&#x27;s take the logarithm of \( T_k \):

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Using the Taylor expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \cdots \), we can expand this as:

\( \ln T_k \approx k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \).

Therefore, exponentiating, we have:

\( T_k \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \right) \).

So for terms where \( k \) is small compared to \( n^{4/3} \), the correction term \( \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \) is negligible, so \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For larger \( k \), the approximation might break down, but if the dominant contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \) is not too large, maybe this is okay.

Therefore, maybe \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \). Let&#x27;s analyze this sum.

Again, let&#x27;s make a substitution \( c = k/n \), so \( k = cn \), \( c \in (0, 1] \). Then, \( e^{k^2 / n^2} = e^{c^2} \). The sum becomes approximately \( \sum_{c=1/n}^{1} e^{c^2} \cdot n \, dc \), which is similar to an integral. So:

\( a_n \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} \, dc \).

But the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Then, \( \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \), so \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), so \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

But wait, the problem is that this approximation might not capture the true behavior of \( a_n \). If \( a_n \) is indeed growing linearly, then the limit is 1. However, perhaps the actual growth of \( a_n \) is faster than linear? Let&#x27;s check for specific values.

Take \( n = 2 \):

\( a_2 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{4}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{14}{4} = 3.5 \).

For \( n = 3 \):

\( a_3 = \left(1 + \frac{1}{9}\right)^1 + \left(1 + \frac{2}{9}\right)^2 + \left(1 + \frac{3}{9}\right)^3 \approx 1.1111 + (1.2222)^2 + (1.3333)^3 \approx 1.1111 + 1.4938 + 2.3704 \approx 4.9753 \).

For \( n = 10 \), it&#x27;s tedious to compute, but maybe we can see the trend. As \( n \) increases, each term \( T_k \) for \( k \) up to \( n \) is increasing from 1 to approximately \( e \). However, the number of terms is increasing as well. If each term is roughly \( e^{c^2} \), then the sum is like a Riemann sum for \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \times n \), which does grow linearly with \( n \).

But let&#x27;s check for \( n = 100 \). If \( a_{100} \approx 100 \times \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \approx 100 \times 1.46265 \approx 146.265 \). If we compute \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \), since \( 1/10000 \) is a very small exponent, the result should be very close to 1. Similarly, as \( n \) increases, \( a_n \) grows linearly, so \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(a_n)/n^2} \approx e^{- (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 } \approx 1 - (\ln n + \ln C)/n^2 \), which tends to 1.

But the problem is that maybe the initial approximation where \( T_k \approx e^{k^2/n^2} \) is too crude. Let&#x27;s re-examine the term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \).

Taking the natural logarithm:

\( \ln T_k = k \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \).

Expanding the logarithm as a Taylor series:

\( \ln(1 + x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots \).

Here, \( x = \frac{k}{n^2} \), so:

\( \ln T_k = k \left( \frac{k}{n^2} - \frac{k^2}{2n^4} + \frac{k^3}{3n^6} - \cdots \right) = \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \frac{k^4}{3n^6} - \cdots \).

Therefore, the leading term is \( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \). If we exponentiate this, we get:

\( T_k = \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \approx \exp\left( \frac{k^2}{n^2} \right) \left(1 - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} + \cdots \right) \).

So the correction term is \( - \frac{k^3}{2n^4} \). For the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2} \) to be valid, we need the next term \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) to be negligible compared to 1.

So \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \ll 1 \). For \( k \leq n \), the maximum value of \( \frac{k^3}{n^4} \) is \( \frac{n^3}{n^4} = \frac{1}{n} \), which tends to 0 as \( n \to \infty \). Therefore, even for the largest \( k = n \), the correction term is \( \frac{n^3}{2n^4} = \frac{1}{2n} \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the approximation \( T_k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is valid for all \( k \leq n \).

Therefore, the entire sum \( a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \).

Now, let&#x27;s analyze this sum. Let me make a substitution \( x = k/n \), so \( k = xn \), and \( x \) ranges from \( 1/n \) to 1 in increments of \( 1/n \). Then, \( e^{k^2 /n^2} = e^{x^2} \). The sum becomes:

\( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{x^2} \approx n \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

This is a Riemann sum approximation. The sum \( \sum_{k=1}^n e^{(k/n)^2} \cdot \frac{1}{n} \approx \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \). Therefore, multiplying by \( n \), the original sum is approximately \( n \cdot \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \).

But wait, the integral \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{x^2} dx \) is a constant (approximately 1.46265). Therefore, the sum \( a_n \approx C n \), where \( C \) is a constant. Therefore, \( \ln a_n \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n) \).

Therefore, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln n}{n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( \ln n / n^2 \) and \( \ln C / n^2 \) tend to 0. Therefore, the limit is 0, so \( \ln L = -0 = 0 \), which implies \( L = e^0 = 1 \).

However, this contradicts my earlier thought that maybe there&#x27;s a term contributing more significantly. Wait, but according to this Riemann sum approximation, the sum \( a_n \) grows linearly with \( n \). Therefore, \( a_n \) ~ \( C n \), so the inverse \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) is \( (C n)^{-1/n^2} \). As \( n \to \infty \), both \( C^{-1/n^2} \) and \( n^{-1/n^2} \) approach 1, since any constant raised to the power \( -1/n^2 \) tends to 1, and \( n^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \).

Therefore, according to this reasoning, the limit should be 1. However, I recall that in some similar problems, even if the sum grows linearly, the limit might not be 1 due to more precise exponential terms. But in this case, since we&#x27;re taking the \( -1/n^2 \) power, which decays to zero, any polynomial growth in \( a_n \) would lead to the limit being 1. For example, if \( a_n = n \), then \( (n)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln n /n^2} \to 1 \). Similarly, if \( a_n = e^{o(n^2)} \), then \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \). So unless \( a_n \) has a term like \( e^{n^2} \), the limit is 1.

But according to the previous analysis, the sum \( a_n \) is approximated by \( C n \), so the limit is 1. But maybe the approximation is missing an exponential term? Let me check with a different approach.

Alternative approach: Find the dominant term in the sum \( a_n \). Since each term \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 /n^2} \), as we established earlier, the terms increase as \( k \) increases because \( e^{k^2 /n^2} \) is an increasing function of \( k \). Therefore, the last term \( T_n = \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2}\right)^n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n \approx e \). The term before the last is \( T_{n-1} = \left(1 + \frac{n - 1}{n^2}\right)^{n - 1} \approx e^{(n - 1)^2 /n^2} \approx e^{1 - 2/n + 1/n^2} \approx e \cdot e^{-2/n} \approx e (1 - 2/n) \).

So the largest terms are approaching \( e \), and the terms near \( k = n \) are approximately \( e \). However, there are about \( n \) terms, each roughly of order up to \( e \). But if most terms are much smaller than \( e \), the sum might still be dominated by the last few terms. Wait, but how much do the terms near \( k = n \) contribute?

Suppose we consider the last \( m \) terms, where \( m \) is some fixed number. Each of these terms is approximately \( e \), so their total contribution is \( m e \). The rest of the terms (there are \( n - m \) of them) are smaller. If \( m \) is fixed, then as \( n \to \infty \), the sum \( a_n \) would be \( m e + o(n) \). But if \( m \) is allowed to grow with \( n \), say \( m = \sqrt{n} \), then the contribution would be \( \sqrt{n} e \), which is still \( o(n) \). Therefore, perhaps the sum is still dominated by the bulk of the terms rather than the last few.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by the integral \( n \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \), as before, leading to linear growth. Let me compute \( \int_{0}^{1} e^{c^2} dc \). The integral of \( e^{c^2} \) from 0 to 1 is known as the imaginary error function, but its approximate value is indeed around 1.46265. So multiplying by \( n \), \( a_n \approx 1.46265 n \).

Therefore, \( a_n \) is roughly proportional to \( n \), so \( \ln a_n \approx \ln n + \ln(1.46265) \). Then, \( \frac{1}{n^2} \ln a_n \approx \frac{\ln n}{n^2} + \frac{\ln(1.46265)}{n^2} \), both terms go to zero. Hence, \( \ln L = 0 \implies L = 1 \).

But let&#x27;s test this with numerical examples for small \( n \):

For \( n = 1 \), \( a_1 = (1 + 1/1^2)^1 = 2 \), so \( (a_1)^{-1/1^2} = 1/2 \).

For \( n = 2 \), \( a_2 = (1 + 1/4)^1 + (1 + 2/4)^2 = 5/4 + (3/2)^2 = 5/4 + 9/4 = 14/4 = 3.5 \), so \( (3.5)^{-1/4} \approx 0.645 \).

For \( n = 3 \), \( a_3 \approx 4.9753 \), so \( (4.9753)^{-1/9} \approx e^{-\ln(4.9753)/9} \approx e^{-1.606/9} \approx e^{-0.178} \approx 0.837 \).

For \( n = 10 \), if \( a_{10} \approx 10 \times 1.46265 \approx 14.6265 \), then \( (14.6265)^{-1/100} \approx e^{-\ln(14.6265)/100} \approx e^{-2.683/100} \approx e^{-0.02683} \approx 0.9736 \).

For \( n = 100 \), \( a_{100} \approx 146.265 \), so \( (146.265)^{-1/10000} \approx e^{-\ln(146.265)/10000} \approx e^{-4.986/10000} \approx e^{-0.0004986} \approx 0.9995 \).

So as \( n \) increases, \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) seems to approach 1 from below. Therefore, the numerical evidence supports the analytical conclusion that the limit is 1.

However, I need to be careful here. The numerical examples for small \( n \) are not conclusive, but as \( n \) increases, the trend is clearly approaching 1. Hence, it&#x27;s reasonable to conclude that the limit is indeed 1.

But wait, let me consider another perspective. Suppose there exists a term in the sum \( a_n \) that grows exponentially with \( n^2 \), then \( a_n \) would be dominated by that term, and \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) would tend to a value less than 1. But according to our analysis, all terms \( T_k \) are at most \( e \), and their sum grows linearly. So there&#x27;s no such term here. Therefore, the conclusion remains that the limit is 1.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider the possibility that the main contribution to the sum comes from terms where \( k \approx \sqrt{n} \). Wait, but why would that be? For \( k = \sqrt{n} \), \( \frac{k}{n^2} = \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \), so \( T_k = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n^{3/2}} \right)^{\sqrt{n}} \approx e^{\sqrt{n}/n^{3/2}} = e^{1/n} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{n} \). So these terms are close to 1. Therefore, such terms don&#x27;t contribute significantly.

Another angle: Let&#x27;s consider using the AM-GM inequality on the terms of the sum. The geometric mean of the terms is \( \left( \prod_{k=1}^n T_k \right)^{1/n} \leq \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n T_k = \frac{a_n}{n} \). But I&#x27;m not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, note that since \( a_n \geq T_n = \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx e \), and \( a_n \leq n \left(1 + \frac{n}{n^2} \right)^n = n \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \approx n e \). Therefore, \( e \leq a_n \leq n e \). Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):

\( (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2} \).

Compute the limits of the bounds. The upper bound \( e^{-1/n^2} \to 1 \) as \( n \to \infty \). The lower bound \( (n e)^{-1/n^2} = e^{-\ln(n e)/n^2} = e^{-(\ln n + 1)/n^2} \to e^0 = 1 \). Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the limit is 1.

This is a solid argument. Since \( a_n \) is sandwiched between \( e \) and \( n e \), both of which raised to \( -1/n^2 \) tend to 1, so the limit must be 1.

Therefore, after considering various approaches—approximating the sum by an integral, analyzing individual terms, using inequalities—it seems consistent that the limit is 1. The key realization is that \( a_n \) grows polynomially (linearly) with \( n \), and thus \( (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \) approaches 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{1}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \( \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(a_n)^{-1/n^2} \), where \( a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \), we start by analyzing the behavior of the terms in the sum \( a_n \).

1. **Approximation of Terms**:
   Each term \( \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2} \right)^k \) can be approximated using the expansion \( \ln(1 + x) \approx x \) for small \( x \). This gives:
   \[
   \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right) \approx \frac{k}{n^2}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \left(1 + \frac{k}{n^2}\right)^k \approx e^{k^2 / n^2}
   \]

2. **Sum Approximation**:
   The sum \( a_n \) can be approximated by considering the behavior of \( e^{k^2 / n^2} \). For large \( n \), we approximate the sum by an integral:
   \[
   a_n \approx \sum_{k=1}^n e^{k^2 / n^2} \approx n \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc
   \]
   where \( c = k/n \). The integral \( \int_0^1 e^{c^2} \, dc \) is a constant, leading to \( a_n \approx C n \) for some constant \( C \).

3. **Logarithm and Limit Analysis**:
   Taking the logarithm of \( a_n \):
   \[
   \ln(a_n) \approx \ln(C) + \ln(n)
   \]
   Then,
   \[
   \frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) \approx \frac{\ln(C) + \ln(n)}{n^2} \to 0 \quad \text{as} \quad n \to \infty
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   \ln L = \lim_{n \to \infty} -\frac{1}{n^2} \ln(a_n) = 0 \implies L = e^0 = 1
   \]

4. **Squeeze Theorem**:
   Using bounds for \( a_n \):
   \[
   e \leq a_n \leq n e
   \]
   Taking the inverse and raising to \( 1/n^2 \):
   \[
   (n e)^{-1/n^2} \leq (a_n)^{-1/n^2} \leq e^{-1/n^2}
   \]
   Both bounds approach 1 as \( n \to \infty \), confirming the limit by the squeeze theorem.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

Problem: Find an integer $x$ such that $x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020}$. Provide your answer as the smallest non-negative integer that satisfies this congruence. Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Awesome! We going to show you how to do this! Here is a binomial theorem: $(a+x)(a-x)=(a^{2}-x^{2})+2at$ so $(2020+x)^{2}(2020-x)^{2}=(2020^{2}-x^{2}-2020^{2}+x^{2})+2(2020)x=0$ so $\boxed{-2020x=4}$

and $\frac {-2020}{4}=510$. Notice $\frac {677}{510}=\boxed{1}\frac {67}{510}\approx0 \frac {05}$          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find an integer x such that x raised to the 677th power is congruent to 3 modulo 2020. Hmm, that&#x27;s a pretty high exponent. Let me start by recalling some number theory concepts that might help here.

First, 2020 factors into prime components. Let me factorize 2020. 2020 divided by 2 is 1010, divided by 2 again is 505. Then 505 divided by 5 is 101, and 101 is a prime number. So, the prime factorization of 2020 is 2^2 * 5 * 101. So, modulus 2020 is composite, and since 2^2, 5, and 101 are pairwise coprime, maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to solve this congruence. That is, solve the congruence modulo each prime power factor separately and then combine the solutions.

So, if I can find x such that:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 101,

then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there will be a unique solution mod 2020, which is the product of 4, 5, and 101. So, solving each of these congruences separately and then combining them should give me the answer. Let me handle each modulus one by one.

Starting with mod 4:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4.

But modulo 4, the possible residues are 0, 1, 2, 3. Let&#x27;s see what their powers are.

However, 3 mod 4 is -1. So maybe x is congruent to -1 mod 4? Let&#x27;s check.

If x ≡ -1 mod 4, then x^677 ≡ (-1)^677 ≡ -1 ≡ 3 mod 4. That works. So x ≡ 3 mod 4. So that&#x27;s the solution modulo 4.

Wait, but are there other possibilities? Let&#x27;s check.

Suppose x ≡ 1 mod 4. Then x^677 ≡ 1 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 0 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 2 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4 (since 2^2 is 0 mod 4, and higher exponents are still 0). So 2 mod 4 raised to any power higher than 1 is 0 mod 4. So 2 is out. Similarly, 3 mod 4 raised to any odd power is 3 mod 4. So yes, only x ≡ 3 mod 4 works. So the solution for modulus 4 is 3 mod 4.

Next, modulo 5.

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5.

We can use Fermat&#x27;s little theorem here. Since 5 is prime, for any x not divisible by 5, x^(4) ≡ 1 mod 5. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 4.

677 divided by 4: 4*169=676, so 677=4*169 +1. So 677 ≡1 mod 4.

Therefore, x^677 ≡ x^1 ≡ x mod 5. Therefore, the equation simplifies to x ≡3 mod5. So the solution modulo 5 is x ≡3 mod5.

Now, modulus 101.

This seems trickier because 101 is a larger prime. Let&#x27;s see. We need to solve x^677 ≡3 mod101.

Again, using Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, since 101 is prime, x^100 ≡1 mod101 for x not divisible by 101. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 100. Let&#x27;s compute 677 divided by 100. 100*6=600, 677-600=77. So 677 ≡77 mod100. Therefore, x^677 ≡x^77 mod101. So the equation becomes x^77 ≡3 mod101.

So now we need to solve x^77 ≡3 mod101. Hmm. To solve for x, we might need to find the 77th root of 3 modulo 101. Since 101 is prime, perhaps we can find an integer k such that (x^k)^m ≡x mod101, where m is some exponent. Alternatively, maybe we can find an inverse of 77 modulo 100, since the multiplicative order is 100.

If we can find an integer d such that 77*d ≡1 mod100, then raising both sides of the congruence x^77 ≡3 mod101 to the dth power would give x ≡3^d mod101.

So let&#x27;s find d, the inverse of 77 modulo100.

To find d such that 77d ≡1 mod100.

We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Compute gcd(77,100):

100 =1*77 +23

77=3*23 +8

23=2*8 +7

8=1*7 +1

7=7*1 +0

So gcd is 1. Now backtracking:

1=8 -1*7

But 7=23 -2*8, so substitute:

1=8 -1*(23 -2*8)=3*8 -1*23

But 8=77 -3*23, so substitute:

1=3*(77 -3*23) -1*23=3*77 -10*23

But 23=100 -1*77, substitute:

1=3*77 -10*(100 -1*77)=13*77 -10*100

Therefore, 13*77 ≡1 mod100. So d=13. Therefore, the inverse of 77 mod100 is13.

Therefore, x ≡3^13 mod101. So compute 3^13 mod101.

Let me compute 3^13 step by step:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^4=(3^2)^2=81

3^8=(3^4)^2=81^2. Let&#x27;s compute 81^2 mod101.

81^2 = 6561. 6561 divided by 101: 101*64=6464, 6561-6464=97. So 3^8 ≡97 mod101.

3^13 =3^8 *3^4 *3^1 =97*81*3 mod101.

First compute 97*81 mod101.

Compute 97*81: 97*80=7760, plus 97=7857. Now divide 7857 by101:

101*77=7777, 7857-7777=80. So 97*81 ≡80 mod101.

Then multiply by 3: 80*3=240. 240 mod101: 101*2=202, 240-202=38. So 3^13 ≡38 mod101.

Therefore, x ≡38 mod101.

Wait, let me verify that 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But that might take a while. Alternatively, let&#x27;s check if 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But since we know that 38≡3^13 mod101, then 38^77 ≡(3^13)^77=3^(13*77). But 13*77=1001, which is 10*100 +1. Therefore, 3^(1001)≡(3^100)^10 *3^1 ≡1^10 *3 ≡3 mod101. So yes, that works. Therefore, 38^77 ≡3 mod101. So x≡38 mod101 is correct.

So putting it all together, we have:

x ≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5,

x≡38 mod101.

Now, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer x that satisfies all three congruences. Let&#x27;s use the Chinese Remainder Theorem step by step.

First, let&#x27;s combine the congruences modulo 4 and 5.

Find x such that:

x≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5.

Let me write x=4k +3 for some integer k. Substitute into the second congruence:

4k +3 ≡3 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5. Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod5. Since 4*4=16≡1 mod5, inverse of 4 is4. Therefore, k≡0*4≡0 mod5. So k=5m for some integer m. Therefore, x=4*(5m) +3=20m +3.

Thus, the solution to the first two congruences is x≡3 mod20.

Now, combine this with x≡38 mod101.

So now, we need to solve:

x≡3 mod20,

x≡38 mod101.

Let me express x as x=20n +3 for some integer n. Substitute into the second congruence:

20n +3 ≡38 mod101 =&gt; 20n ≡35 mod101. So 20n ≡35 mod101.

We need to solve for n: 20n ≡35 mod101. Let&#x27;s find the inverse of 20 mod101.

Use the extended Euclidean algorithm again.

Find integers a and b such that 20a +101b=1.

101=5*20 +1

20=20*1 +0

So backtracking:

1=101 -5*20

Therefore, inverse of 20 mod101 is -5. But -5 mod101 is 96. So inverse is96.

Therefore, n≡35*96 mod101.

Compute 35*96:

35*96=35*(100 -4)=3500 -140=3360.

Now, 3360 divided by101:

101*33=3333, 3360 -3333=27. So 3360≡27 mod101. Therefore, n≡27 mod101.

Therefore, n=101m +27 for some integer m. Then x=20*(101m +27) +3=2020m +540 +3=2020m +543.

Therefore, the smallest non-negative solution is x=543 mod2020. Since 543 is less than 2020, the answer is543.

Wait, but let me check if 543^677 ≡3 mod2020. To verify, we can check modulo4,5,101.

First, modulo4: 543 mod4=543-4*135=543-540=3 mod4. Then 3^677≡3 mod4. Correct.

Modulo5:543 mod5=543-5*108=543-540=3 mod5. Then 3^677≡3 mod5 as earlier. Correct.

Modulo101:543 divided by101:101*5=505, 543-505=38. So 543≡38 mod101. Then 38^677 mod101. But as earlier, 38≡3^13 mod101, so 38^677=3^(13*677). Compute 13*677=8801. Now, since x^100≡1 mod101, reduce 8801 mod100. 8801 divided by100 is88 with remainder1. So 8801≡1 mod100. Therefore, 3^(8801)≡3^1≡3 mod101. So yes, 38^677≡3 mod101. Therefore, all congruences are satisfied.

Therefore, the answer is543.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{543}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \), we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) by solving the congruence modulo the prime power factors of 2020, which are \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 101 \).

1. **Modulo 4**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{4}
   \]
   Since \( 3 \equiv -1 \pmod{4} \) and any odd power of \(-1\) is \(-1\), we get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).

2. **Modulo 5**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{5}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 4 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \).

3. **Modulo 101**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{101}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^{100} \equiv 1 \pmod{101} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 100 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 77 \pmod{100} \). We need to solve \( x^{77} \equiv 3 \pmod{101} \). Finding the inverse of 77 modulo 100 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we get \( d = 13 \). Thus, \( x \equiv 3^{13} \pmod{101} \). Calculating \( 3^{13} \mod 101 \) gives \( 38 \), so \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \).

Combining these results using CRT:
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \) and \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) to get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \).
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \) with \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \). Solving \( 20n + 3 \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \) gives \( n \equiv 27 \pmod{101} \). Thus, \( x = 20 \cdot 27 + 3 = 543 \).

The smallest non-negative integer \( x \) that satisfies \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \) is \(\boxed{543}\).          </p>

Problem: Find an integer $x$ such that $x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020}$. Provide your answer as the smallest non-negative integer that satisfies this congruence. Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>

Response: First, express $2020$ in factors of $676$:

$2020 = \boxed{2^{3} \cdot 5^{3}}$

Therefor the leftover portion, $677,-676$ must give the remainder $3$.

To solve, we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:

We have that
$674- 676 = \boxed{359-674}$

$\equiv 359 \equiv \underbrace{\overbrace{\boxed{9^-4}}^\dfrac{263}{53}}_{\boxed{9+210}}\quad \equiv 313\quad \equiv -\overbrace{\boxed{3+270}}^\dfrac{99}{53}=136\quad \equiv 3$

So the remainder $-3,-2,-1$ is congruent to $136$:

$-3 \equiv 136$

$\textrm{To satisfy the congruence, we must have x=136}$

\boxed{136}

Note: There is a simpler way to solve using divisions, but we chose Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem to make do \boxed{136}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find an integer x such that x raised to the 677th power is congruent to 3 modulo 2020. Hmm, that&#x27;s a pretty high exponent. Let me start by recalling some number theory concepts that might help here.

First, 2020 factors into prime components. Let me factorize 2020. 2020 divided by 2 is 1010, divided by 2 again is 505. Then 505 divided by 5 is 101, and 101 is a prime number. So, the prime factorization of 2020 is 2^2 * 5 * 101. So, modulus 2020 is composite, and since 2^2, 5, and 101 are pairwise coprime, maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to solve this congruence. That is, solve the congruence modulo each prime power factor separately and then combine the solutions.

So, if I can find x such that:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 101,

then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there will be a unique solution mod 2020, which is the product of 4, 5, and 101. So, solving each of these congruences separately and then combining them should give me the answer. Let me handle each modulus one by one.

Starting with mod 4:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4.

But modulo 4, the possible residues are 0, 1, 2, 3. Let&#x27;s see what their powers are.

However, 3 mod 4 is -1. So maybe x is congruent to -1 mod 4? Let&#x27;s check.

If x ≡ -1 mod 4, then x^677 ≡ (-1)^677 ≡ -1 ≡ 3 mod 4. That works. So x ≡ 3 mod 4. So that&#x27;s the solution modulo 4.

Wait, but are there other possibilities? Let&#x27;s check.

Suppose x ≡ 1 mod 4. Then x^677 ≡ 1 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 0 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 2 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4 (since 2^2 is 0 mod 4, and higher exponents are still 0). So 2 mod 4 raised to any power higher than 1 is 0 mod 4. So 2 is out. Similarly, 3 mod 4 raised to any odd power is 3 mod 4. So yes, only x ≡ 3 mod 4 works. So the solution for modulus 4 is 3 mod 4.

Next, modulo 5.

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5.

We can use Fermat&#x27;s little theorem here. Since 5 is prime, for any x not divisible by 5, x^(4) ≡ 1 mod 5. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 4.

677 divided by 4: 4*169=676, so 677=4*169 +1. So 677 ≡1 mod 4.

Therefore, x^677 ≡ x^1 ≡ x mod 5. Therefore, the equation simplifies to x ≡3 mod5. So the solution modulo 5 is x ≡3 mod5.

Now, modulus 101.

This seems trickier because 101 is a larger prime. Let&#x27;s see. We need to solve x^677 ≡3 mod101.

Again, using Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, since 101 is prime, x^100 ≡1 mod101 for x not divisible by 101. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 100. Let&#x27;s compute 677 divided by 100. 100*6=600, 677-600=77. So 677 ≡77 mod100. Therefore, x^677 ≡x^77 mod101. So the equation becomes x^77 ≡3 mod101.

So now we need to solve x^77 ≡3 mod101. Hmm. To solve for x, we might need to find the 77th root of 3 modulo 101. Since 101 is prime, perhaps we can find an integer k such that (x^k)^m ≡x mod101, where m is some exponent. Alternatively, maybe we can find an inverse of 77 modulo 100, since the multiplicative order is 100.

If we can find an integer d such that 77*d ≡1 mod100, then raising both sides of the congruence x^77 ≡3 mod101 to the dth power would give x ≡3^d mod101.

So let&#x27;s find d, the inverse of 77 modulo100.

To find d such that 77d ≡1 mod100.

We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Compute gcd(77,100):

100 =1*77 +23

77=3*23 +8

23=2*8 +7

8=1*7 +1

7=7*1 +0

So gcd is 1. Now backtracking:

1=8 -1*7

But 7=23 -2*8, so substitute:

1=8 -1*(23 -2*8)=3*8 -1*23

But 8=77 -3*23, so substitute:

1=3*(77 -3*23) -1*23=3*77 -10*23

But 23=100 -1*77, substitute:

1=3*77 -10*(100 -1*77)=13*77 -10*100

Therefore, 13*77 ≡1 mod100. So d=13. Therefore, the inverse of 77 mod100 is13.

Therefore, x ≡3^13 mod101. So compute 3^13 mod101.

Let me compute 3^13 step by step:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^4=(3^2)^2=81

3^8=(3^4)^2=81^2. Let&#x27;s compute 81^2 mod101.

81^2 = 6561. 6561 divided by 101: 101*64=6464, 6561-6464=97. So 3^8 ≡97 mod101.

3^13 =3^8 *3^4 *3^1 =97*81*3 mod101.

First compute 97*81 mod101.

Compute 97*81: 97*80=7760, plus 97=7857. Now divide 7857 by101:

101*77=7777, 7857-7777=80. So 97*81 ≡80 mod101.

Then multiply by 3: 80*3=240. 240 mod101: 101*2=202, 240-202=38. So 3^13 ≡38 mod101.

Therefore, x ≡38 mod101.

Wait, let me verify that 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But that might take a while. Alternatively, let&#x27;s check if 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But since we know that 38≡3^13 mod101, then 38^77 ≡(3^13)^77=3^(13*77). But 13*77=1001, which is 10*100 +1. Therefore, 3^(1001)≡(3^100)^10 *3^1 ≡1^10 *3 ≡3 mod101. So yes, that works. Therefore, 38^77 ≡3 mod101. So x≡38 mod101 is correct.

So putting it all together, we have:

x ≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5,

x≡38 mod101.

Now, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer x that satisfies all three congruences. Let&#x27;s use the Chinese Remainder Theorem step by step.

First, let&#x27;s combine the congruences modulo 4 and 5.

Find x such that:

x≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5.

Let me write x=4k +3 for some integer k. Substitute into the second congruence:

4k +3 ≡3 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5. Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod5. Since 4*4=16≡1 mod5, inverse of 4 is4. Therefore, k≡0*4≡0 mod5. So k=5m for some integer m. Therefore, x=4*(5m) +3=20m +3.

Thus, the solution to the first two congruences is x≡3 mod20.

Now, combine this with x≡38 mod101.

So now, we need to solve:

x≡3 mod20,

x≡38 mod101.

Let me express x as x=20n +3 for some integer n. Substitute into the second congruence:

20n +3 ≡38 mod101 =&gt; 20n ≡35 mod101. So 20n ≡35 mod101.

We need to solve for n: 20n ≡35 mod101. Let&#x27;s find the inverse of 20 mod101.

Use the extended Euclidean algorithm again.

Find integers a and b such that 20a +101b=1.

101=5*20 +1

20=20*1 +0

So backtracking:

1=101 -5*20

Therefore, inverse of 20 mod101 is -5. But -5 mod101 is 96. So inverse is96.

Therefore, n≡35*96 mod101.

Compute 35*96:

35*96=35*(100 -4)=3500 -140=3360.

Now, 3360 divided by101:

101*33=3333, 3360 -3333=27. So 3360≡27 mod101. Therefore, n≡27 mod101.

Therefore, n=101m +27 for some integer m. Then x=20*(101m +27) +3=2020m +540 +3=2020m +543.

Therefore, the smallest non-negative solution is x=543 mod2020. Since 543 is less than 2020, the answer is543.

Wait, but let me check if 543^677 ≡3 mod2020. To verify, we can check modulo4,5,101.

First, modulo4: 543 mod4=543-4*135=543-540=3 mod4. Then 3^677≡3 mod4. Correct.

Modulo5:543 mod5=543-5*108=543-540=3 mod5. Then 3^677≡3 mod5 as earlier. Correct.

Modulo101:543 divided by101:101*5=505, 543-505=38. So 543≡38 mod101. Then 38^677 mod101. But as earlier, 38≡3^13 mod101, so 38^677=3^(13*677). Compute 13*677=8801. Now, since x^100≡1 mod101, reduce 8801 mod100. 8801 divided by100 is88 with remainder1. So 8801≡1 mod100. Therefore, 3^(8801)≡3^1≡3 mod101. So yes, 38^677≡3 mod101. Therefore, all congruences are satisfied.

Therefore, the answer is543.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{543}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \), we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) by solving the congruence modulo the prime power factors of 2020, which are \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 101 \).

1. **Modulo 4**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{4}
   \]
   Since \( 3 \equiv -1 \pmod{4} \) and any odd power of \(-1\) is \(-1\), we get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).

2. **Modulo 5**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{5}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 4 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \).

3. **Modulo 101**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{101}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^{100} \equiv 1 \pmod{101} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 100 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 77 \pmod{100} \). We need to solve \( x^{77} \equiv 3 \pmod{101} \). Finding the inverse of 77 modulo 100 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we get \( d = 13 \). Thus, \( x \equiv 3^{13} \pmod{101} \). Calculating \( 3^{13} \mod 101 \) gives \( 38 \), so \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \).

Combining these results using CRT:
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \) and \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) to get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \).
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \) with \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \). Solving \( 20n + 3 \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \) gives \( n \equiv 27 \pmod{101} \). Thus, \( x = 20 \cdot 27 + 3 = 543 \).

The smallest non-negative integer \( x \) that satisfies \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \) is \(\boxed{543}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find an integer x such that x raised to the 677th power is congruent to 3 modulo 2020. Hmm, that&#x27;s a pretty high exponent. Let me start by recalling some number theory concepts that might help here.

First, 2020 factors into prime components. Let me factorize 2020. 2020 divided by 2 is 1010, divided by 2 again is 505. Then 505 divided by 5 is 101, and 101 is a prime number. So, the prime factorization of 2020 is 2^2 * 5 * 101. So, modulus 2020 is composite, and since 2^2, 5, and 101 are pairwise coprime, maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to solve this congruence. That is, solve the congruence modulo each prime power factor separately and then combine the solutions.

So, if I can find x such that:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 101,

then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there will be a unique solution mod 2020, which is the product of 4, 5, and 101. So, solving each of these congruences separately and then combining them should give me the answer. Let me handle each modulus one by one.

Starting with mod 4:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4.

But modulo 4, the possible residues are 0, 1, 2, 3. Let&#x27;s see what their powers are.

However, 3 mod 4 is -1. So maybe x is congruent to -1 mod 4? Let&#x27;s check.

If x ≡ -1 mod 4, then x^677 ≡ (-1)^677 ≡ -1 ≡ 3 mod 4. That works. So x ≡ 3 mod 4. So that&#x27;s the solution modulo 4.

Wait, but are there other possibilities? Let&#x27;s check.

Suppose x ≡ 1 mod 4. Then x^677 ≡ 1 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 0 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 2 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4 (since 2^2 is 0 mod 4, and higher exponents are still 0). So 2 mod 4 raised to any power higher than 1 is 0 mod 4. So 2 is out. Similarly, 3 mod 4 raised to any odd power is 3 mod 4. So yes, only x ≡ 3 mod 4 works. So the solution for modulus 4 is 3 mod 4.

Next, modulo 5.

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5.

We can use Fermat&#x27;s little theorem here. Since 5 is prime, for any x not divisible by 5, x^(4) ≡ 1 mod 5. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 4.

677 divided by 4: 4*169=676, so 677=4*169 +1. So 677 ≡1 mod 4.

Therefore, x^677 ≡ x^1 ≡ x mod 5. Therefore, the equation simplifies to x ≡3 mod5. So the solution modulo 5 is x ≡3 mod5.

Now, modulus 101.

This seems trickier because 101 is a larger prime. Let&#x27;s see. We need to solve x^677 ≡3 mod101.

Again, using Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, since 101 is prime, x^100 ≡1 mod101 for x not divisible by 101. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 100. Let&#x27;s compute 677 divided by 100. 100*6=600, 677-600=77. So 677 ≡77 mod100. Therefore, x^677 ≡x^77 mod101. So the equation becomes x^77 ≡3 mod101.

So now we need to solve x^77 ≡3 mod101. Hmm. To solve for x, we might need to find the 77th root of 3 modulo 101. Since 101 is prime, perhaps we can find an integer k such that (x^k)^m ≡x mod101, where m is some exponent. Alternatively, maybe we can find an inverse of 77 modulo 100, since the multiplicative order is 100.

If we can find an integer d such that 77*d ≡1 mod100, then raising both sides of the congruence x^77 ≡3 mod101 to the dth power would give x ≡3^d mod101.

So let&#x27;s find d, the inverse of 77 modulo100.

To find d such that 77d ≡1 mod100.

We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Compute gcd(77,100):

100 =1*77 +23

77=3*23 +8

23=2*8 +7

8=1*7 +1

7=7*1 +0

So gcd is 1. Now backtracking:

1=8 -1*7

But 7=23 -2*8, so substitute:

1=8 -1*(23 -2*8)=3*8 -1*23

But 8=77 -3*23, so substitute:

1=3*(77 -3*23) -1*23=3*77 -10*23

But 23=100 -1*77, substitute:

1=3*77 -10*(100 -1*77)=13*77 -10*100

Therefore, 13*77 ≡1 mod100. So d=13. Therefore, the inverse of 77 mod100 is13.

Therefore, x ≡3^13 mod101. So compute 3^13 mod101.

Let me compute 3^13 step by step:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^4=(3^2)^2=81

3^8=(3^4)^2=81^2. Let&#x27;s compute 81^2 mod101.

81^2 = 6561. 6561 divided by 101: 101*64=6464, 6561-6464=97. So 3^8 ≡97 mod101.

3^13 =3^8 *3^4 *3^1 =97*81*3 mod101.

First compute 97*81 mod101.

Compute 97*81: 97*80=7760, plus 97=7857. Now divide 7857 by101:

101*77=7777, 7857-7777=80. So 97*81 ≡80 mod101.

Then multiply by 3: 80*3=240. 240 mod101: 101*2=202, 240-202=38. So 3^13 ≡38 mod101.

Therefore, x ≡38 mod101.

Wait, let me verify that 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But that might take a while. Alternatively, let&#x27;s check if 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But since we know that 38≡3^13 mod101, then 38^77 ≡(3^13)^77=3^(13*77). But 13*77=1001, which is 10*100 +1. Therefore, 3^(1001)≡(3^100)^10 *3^1 ≡1^10 *3 ≡3 mod101. So yes, that works. Therefore, 38^77 ≡3 mod101. So x≡38 mod101 is correct.

So putting it all together, we have:

x ≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5,

x≡38 mod101.

Now, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer x that satisfies all three congruences. Let&#x27;s use the Chinese Remainder Theorem step by step.

First, let&#x27;s combine the congruences modulo 4 and 5.

Find x such that:

x≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5.

Let me write x=4k +3 for some integer k. Substitute into the second congruence:

4k +3 ≡3 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5. Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod5. Since 4*4=16≡1 mod5, inverse of 4 is4. Therefore, k≡0*4≡0 mod5. So k=5m for some integer m. Therefore, x=4*(5m) +3=20m +3.

Thus, the solution to the first two congruences is x≡3 mod20.

Now, combine this with x≡38 mod101.

So now, we need to solve:

x≡3 mod20,

x≡38 mod101.

Let me express x as x=20n +3 for some integer n. Substitute into the second congruence:

20n +3 ≡38 mod101 =&gt; 20n ≡35 mod101. So 20n ≡35 mod101.

We need to solve for n: 20n ≡35 mod101. Let&#x27;s find the inverse of 20 mod101.

Use the extended Euclidean algorithm again.

Find integers a and b such that 20a +101b=1.

101=5*20 +1

20=20*1 +0

So backtracking:

1=101 -5*20

Therefore, inverse of 20 mod101 is -5. But -5 mod101 is 96. So inverse is96.

Therefore, n≡35*96 mod101.

Compute 35*96:

35*96=35*(100 -4)=3500 -140=3360.

Now, 3360 divided by101:

101*33=3333, 3360 -3333=27. So 3360≡27 mod101. Therefore, n≡27 mod101.

Therefore, n=101m +27 for some integer m. Then x=20*(101m +27) +3=2020m +540 +3=2020m +543.

Therefore, the smallest non-negative solution is x=543 mod2020. Since 543 is less than 2020, the answer is543.

Wait, but let me check if 543^677 ≡3 mod2020. To verify, we can check modulo4,5,101.

First, modulo4: 543 mod4=543-4*135=543-540=3 mod4. Then 3^677≡3 mod4. Correct.

Modulo5:543 mod5=543-5*108=543-540=3 mod5. Then 3^677≡3 mod5 as earlier. Correct.

Modulo101:543 divided by101:101*5=505, 543-505=38. So 543≡38 mod101. Then 38^677 mod101. But as earlier, 38≡3^13 mod101, so 38^677=3^(13*677). Compute 13*677=8801. Now, since x^100≡1 mod101, reduce 8801 mod100. 8801 divided by100 is88 with remainder1. So 8801≡1 mod100. Therefore, 3^(8801)≡3^1≡3 mod101. So yes, 38^677≡3 mod101. Therefore, all congruences are satisfied.

Therefore, the answer is543.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{543}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \), we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) by solving the congruence modulo the prime power factors of 2020, which are \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 101 \).

1. **Modulo 4**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{4}
   \]
   Since \( 3 \equiv -1 \pmod{4} \) and any odd power of \(-1\) is \(-1\), we get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).

2. **Modulo 5**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{5}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 4 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \).

3. **Modulo 101**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{101}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^{100} \equiv 1 \pmod{101} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 100 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 77 \pmod{100} \). We need to solve \( x^{77} \equiv 3 \pmod{101} \). Finding the inverse of 77 modulo 100 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we get \( d = 13 \). Thus, \( x \equiv 3^{13} \pmod{101} \). Calculating \( 3^{13} \mod 101 \) gives \( 38 \), so \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \).

Combining these results using CRT:
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \) and \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) to get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \).
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \) with \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \). Solving \( 20n + 3 \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \) gives \( n \equiv 27 \pmod{101} \). Thus, \( x = 20 \cdot 27 + 3 = 543 \).

The smallest non-negative integer \( x \) that satisfies \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \) is \(\boxed{543}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find an integer x such that x raised to the 677th power is congruent to 3 modulo 2020. Hmm, that&#x27;s a pretty high exponent. Let me start by recalling some number theory concepts that might help here.

First, 2020 factors into prime components. Let me factorize 2020. 2020 divided by 2 is 1010, divided by 2 again is 505. Then 505 divided by 5 is 101, and 101 is a prime number. So, the prime factorization of 2020 is 2^2 * 5 * 101. So, modulus 2020 is composite, and since 2^2, 5, and 101 are pairwise coprime, maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to solve this congruence. That is, solve the congruence modulo each prime power factor separately and then combine the solutions.

So, if I can find x such that:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 101,

then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there will be a unique solution mod 2020, which is the product of 4, 5, and 101. So, solving each of these congruences separately and then combining them should give me the answer. Let me handle each modulus one by one.

Starting with mod 4:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4.

But modulo 4, the possible residues are 0, 1, 2, 3. Let&#x27;s see what their powers are.

However, 3 mod 4 is -1. So maybe x is congruent to -1 mod 4? Let&#x27;s check.

If x ≡ -1 mod 4, then x^677 ≡ (-1)^677 ≡ -1 ≡ 3 mod 4. That works. So x ≡ 3 mod 4. So that&#x27;s the solution modulo 4.

Wait, but are there other possibilities? Let&#x27;s check.

Suppose x ≡ 1 mod 4. Then x^677 ≡ 1 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 0 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 2 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4 (since 2^2 is 0 mod 4, and higher exponents are still 0). So 2 mod 4 raised to any power higher than 1 is 0 mod 4. So 2 is out. Similarly, 3 mod 4 raised to any odd power is 3 mod 4. So yes, only x ≡ 3 mod 4 works. So the solution for modulus 4 is 3 mod 4.

Next, modulo 5.

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5.

We can use Fermat&#x27;s little theorem here. Since 5 is prime, for any x not divisible by 5, x^(4) ≡ 1 mod 5. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 4.

677 divided by 4: 4*169=676, so 677=4*169 +1. So 677 ≡1 mod 4.

Therefore, x^677 ≡ x^1 ≡ x mod 5. Therefore, the equation simplifies to x ≡3 mod5. So the solution modulo 5 is x ≡3 mod5.

Now, modulus 101.

This seems trickier because 101 is a larger prime. Let&#x27;s see. We need to solve x^677 ≡3 mod101.

Again, using Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, since 101 is prime, x^100 ≡1 mod101 for x not divisible by 101. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 100. Let&#x27;s compute 677 divided by 100. 100*6=600, 677-600=77. So 677 ≡77 mod100. Therefore, x^677 ≡x^77 mod101. So the equation becomes x^77 ≡3 mod101.

So now we need to solve x^77 ≡3 mod101. Hmm. To solve for x, we might need to find the 77th root of 3 modulo 101. Since 101 is prime, perhaps we can find an integer k such that (x^k)^m ≡x mod101, where m is some exponent. Alternatively, maybe we can find an inverse of 77 modulo 100, since the multiplicative order is 100.

If we can find an integer d such that 77*d ≡1 mod100, then raising both sides of the congruence x^77 ≡3 mod101 to the dth power would give x ≡3^d mod101.

So let&#x27;s find d, the inverse of 77 modulo100.

To find d such that 77d ≡1 mod100.

We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Compute gcd(77,100):

100 =1*77 +23

77=3*23 +8

23=2*8 +7

8=1*7 +1

7=7*1 +0

So gcd is 1. Now backtracking:

1=8 -1*7

But 7=23 -2*8, so substitute:

1=8 -1*(23 -2*8)=3*8 -1*23

But 8=77 -3*23, so substitute:

1=3*(77 -3*23) -1*23=3*77 -10*23

But 23=100 -1*77, substitute:

1=3*77 -10*(100 -1*77)=13*77 -10*100

Therefore, 13*77 ≡1 mod100. So d=13. Therefore, the inverse of 77 mod100 is13.

Therefore, x ≡3^13 mod101. So compute 3^13 mod101.

Let me compute 3^13 step by step:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^4=(3^2)^2=81

3^8=(3^4)^2=81^2. Let&#x27;s compute 81^2 mod101.

81^2 = 6561. 6561 divided by 101: 101*64=6464, 6561-6464=97. So 3^8 ≡97 mod101.

3^13 =3^8 *3^4 *3^1 =97*81*3 mod101.

First compute 97*81 mod101.

Compute 97*81: 97*80=7760, plus 97=7857. Now divide 7857 by101:

101*77=7777, 7857-7777=80. So 97*81 ≡80 mod101.

Then multiply by 3: 80*3=240. 240 mod101: 101*2=202, 240-202=38. So 3^13 ≡38 mod101.

Therefore, x ≡38 mod101.

Wait, let me verify that 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But that might take a while. Alternatively, let&#x27;s check if 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But since we know that 38≡3^13 mod101, then 38^77 ≡(3^13)^77=3^(13*77). But 13*77=1001, which is 10*100 +1. Therefore, 3^(1001)≡(3^100)^10 *3^1 ≡1^10 *3 ≡3 mod101. So yes, that works. Therefore, 38^77 ≡3 mod101. So x≡38 mod101 is correct.

So putting it all together, we have:

x ≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5,

x≡38 mod101.

Now, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer x that satisfies all three congruences. Let&#x27;s use the Chinese Remainder Theorem step by step.

First, let&#x27;s combine the congruences modulo 4 and 5.

Find x such that:

x≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5.

Let me write x=4k +3 for some integer k. Substitute into the second congruence:

4k +3 ≡3 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5. Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod5. Since 4*4=16≡1 mod5, inverse of 4 is4. Therefore, k≡0*4≡0 mod5. So k=5m for some integer m. Therefore, x=4*(5m) +3=20m +3.

Thus, the solution to the first two congruences is x≡3 mod20.

Now, combine this with x≡38 mod101.

So now, we need to solve:

x≡3 mod20,

x≡38 mod101.

Let me express x as x=20n +3 for some integer n. Substitute into the second congruence:

20n +3 ≡38 mod101 =&gt; 20n ≡35 mod101. So 20n ≡35 mod101.

We need to solve for n: 20n ≡35 mod101. Let&#x27;s find the inverse of 20 mod101.

Use the extended Euclidean algorithm again.

Find integers a and b such that 20a +101b=1.

101=5*20 +1

20=20*1 +0

So backtracking:

1=101 -5*20

Therefore, inverse of 20 mod101 is -5. But -5 mod101 is 96. So inverse is96.

Therefore, n≡35*96 mod101.

Compute 35*96:

35*96=35*(100 -4)=3500 -140=3360.

Now, 3360 divided by101:

101*33=3333, 3360 -3333=27. So 3360≡27 mod101. Therefore, n≡27 mod101.

Therefore, n=101m +27 for some integer m. Then x=20*(101m +27) +3=2020m +540 +3=2020m +543.

Therefore, the smallest non-negative solution is x=543 mod2020. Since 543 is less than 2020, the answer is543.

Wait, but let me check if 543^677 ≡3 mod2020. To verify, we can check modulo4,5,101.

First, modulo4: 543 mod4=543-4*135=543-540=3 mod4. Then 3^677≡3 mod4. Correct.

Modulo5:543 mod5=543-5*108=543-540=3 mod5. Then 3^677≡3 mod5 as earlier. Correct.

Modulo101:543 divided by101:101*5=505, 543-505=38. So 543≡38 mod101. Then 38^677 mod101. But as earlier, 38≡3^13 mod101, so 38^677=3^(13*677). Compute 13*677=8801. Now, since x^100≡1 mod101, reduce 8801 mod100. 8801 divided by100 is88 with remainder1. So 8801≡1 mod100. Therefore, 3^(8801)≡3^1≡3 mod101. So yes, 38^677≡3 mod101. Therefore, all congruences are satisfied.

Therefore, the answer is543.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{543}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \), we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) by solving the congruence modulo the prime power factors of 2020, which are \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 101 \).

1. **Modulo 4**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{4}
   \]
   Since \( 3 \equiv -1 \pmod{4} \) and any odd power of \(-1\) is \(-1\), we get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).

2. **Modulo 5**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{5}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 4 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \).

3. **Modulo 101**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{101}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^{100} \equiv 1 \pmod{101} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 100 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 77 \pmod{100} \). We need to solve \( x^{77} \equiv 3 \pmod{101} \). Finding the inverse of 77 modulo 100 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we get \( d = 13 \). Thus, \( x \equiv 3^{13} \pmod{101} \). Calculating \( 3^{13} \mod 101 \) gives \( 38 \), so \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \).

Combining these results using CRT:
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \) and \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) to get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \).
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \) with \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \). Solving \( 20n + 3 \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \) gives \( n \equiv 27 \pmod{101} \). Thus, \( x = 20 \cdot 27 + 3 = 543 \).

The smallest non-negative integer \( x \) that satisfies \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \) is \(\boxed{543}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find an integer x such that x raised to the 677th power is congruent to 3 modulo 2020. Hmm, that&#x27;s a pretty high exponent. Let me start by recalling some number theory concepts that might help here.

First, 2020 factors into prime components. Let me factorize 2020. 2020 divided by 2 is 1010, divided by 2 again is 505. Then 505 divided by 5 is 101, and 101 is a prime number. So, the prime factorization of 2020 is 2^2 * 5 * 101. So, modulus 2020 is composite, and since 2^2, 5, and 101 are pairwise coprime, maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to solve this congruence. That is, solve the congruence modulo each prime power factor separately and then combine the solutions.

So, if I can find x such that:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 101,

then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there will be a unique solution mod 2020, which is the product of 4, 5, and 101. So, solving each of these congruences separately and then combining them should give me the answer. Let me handle each modulus one by one.

Starting with mod 4:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4.

But modulo 4, the possible residues are 0, 1, 2, 3. Let&#x27;s see what their powers are.

However, 3 mod 4 is -1. So maybe x is congruent to -1 mod 4? Let&#x27;s check.

If x ≡ -1 mod 4, then x^677 ≡ (-1)^677 ≡ -1 ≡ 3 mod 4. That works. So x ≡ 3 mod 4. So that&#x27;s the solution modulo 4.

Wait, but are there other possibilities? Let&#x27;s check.

Suppose x ≡ 1 mod 4. Then x^677 ≡ 1 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 0 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 2 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4 (since 2^2 is 0 mod 4, and higher exponents are still 0). So 2 mod 4 raised to any power higher than 1 is 0 mod 4. So 2 is out. Similarly, 3 mod 4 raised to any odd power is 3 mod 4. So yes, only x ≡ 3 mod 4 works. So the solution for modulus 4 is 3 mod 4.

Next, modulo 5.

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5.

We can use Fermat&#x27;s little theorem here. Since 5 is prime, for any x not divisible by 5, x^(4) ≡ 1 mod 5. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 4.

677 divided by 4: 4*169=676, so 677=4*169 +1. So 677 ≡1 mod 4.

Therefore, x^677 ≡ x^1 ≡ x mod 5. Therefore, the equation simplifies to x ≡3 mod5. So the solution modulo 5 is x ≡3 mod5.

Now, modulus 101.

This seems trickier because 101 is a larger prime. Let&#x27;s see. We need to solve x^677 ≡3 mod101.

Again, using Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, since 101 is prime, x^100 ≡1 mod101 for x not divisible by 101. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 100. Let&#x27;s compute 677 divided by 100. 100*6=600, 677-600=77. So 677 ≡77 mod100. Therefore, x^677 ≡x^77 mod101. So the equation becomes x^77 ≡3 mod101.

So now we need to solve x^77 ≡3 mod101. Hmm. To solve for x, we might need to find the 77th root of 3 modulo 101. Since 101 is prime, perhaps we can find an integer k such that (x^k)^m ≡x mod101, where m is some exponent. Alternatively, maybe we can find an inverse of 77 modulo 100, since the multiplicative order is 100.

If we can find an integer d such that 77*d ≡1 mod100, then raising both sides of the congruence x^77 ≡3 mod101 to the dth power would give x ≡3^d mod101.

So let&#x27;s find d, the inverse of 77 modulo100.

To find d such that 77d ≡1 mod100.

We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Compute gcd(77,100):

100 =1*77 +23

77=3*23 +8

23=2*8 +7

8=1*7 +1

7=7*1 +0

So gcd is 1. Now backtracking:

1=8 -1*7

But 7=23 -2*8, so substitute:

1=8 -1*(23 -2*8)=3*8 -1*23

But 8=77 -3*23, so substitute:

1=3*(77 -3*23) -1*23=3*77 -10*23

But 23=100 -1*77, substitute:

1=3*77 -10*(100 -1*77)=13*77 -10*100

Therefore, 13*77 ≡1 mod100. So d=13. Therefore, the inverse of 77 mod100 is13.

Therefore, x ≡3^13 mod101. So compute 3^13 mod101.

Let me compute 3^13 step by step:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^4=(3^2)^2=81

3^8=(3^4)^2=81^2. Let&#x27;s compute 81^2 mod101.

81^2 = 6561. 6561 divided by 101: 101*64=6464, 6561-6464=97. So 3^8 ≡97 mod101.

3^13 =3^8 *3^4 *3^1 =97*81*3 mod101.

First compute 97*81 mod101.

Compute 97*81: 97*80=7760, plus 97=7857. Now divide 7857 by101:

101*77=7777, 7857-7777=80. So 97*81 ≡80 mod101.

Then multiply by 3: 80*3=240. 240 mod101: 101*2=202, 240-202=38. So 3^13 ≡38 mod101.

Therefore, x ≡38 mod101.

Wait, let me verify that 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But that might take a while. Alternatively, let&#x27;s check if 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But since we know that 38≡3^13 mod101, then 38^77 ≡(3^13)^77=3^(13*77). But 13*77=1001, which is 10*100 +1. Therefore, 3^(1001)≡(3^100)^10 *3^1 ≡1^10 *3 ≡3 mod101. So yes, that works. Therefore, 38^77 ≡3 mod101. So x≡38 mod101 is correct.

So putting it all together, we have:

x ≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5,

x≡38 mod101.

Now, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer x that satisfies all three congruences. Let&#x27;s use the Chinese Remainder Theorem step by step.

First, let&#x27;s combine the congruences modulo 4 and 5.

Find x such that:

x≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5.

Let me write x=4k +3 for some integer k. Substitute into the second congruence:

4k +3 ≡3 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5. Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod5. Since 4*4=16≡1 mod5, inverse of 4 is4. Therefore, k≡0*4≡0 mod5. So k=5m for some integer m. Therefore, x=4*(5m) +3=20m +3.

Thus, the solution to the first two congruences is x≡3 mod20.

Now, combine this with x≡38 mod101.

So now, we need to solve:

x≡3 mod20,

x≡38 mod101.

Let me express x as x=20n +3 for some integer n. Substitute into the second congruence:

20n +3 ≡38 mod101 =&gt; 20n ≡35 mod101. So 20n ≡35 mod101.

We need to solve for n: 20n ≡35 mod101. Let&#x27;s find the inverse of 20 mod101.

Use the extended Euclidean algorithm again.

Find integers a and b such that 20a +101b=1.

101=5*20 +1

20=20*1 +0

So backtracking:

1=101 -5*20

Therefore, inverse of 20 mod101 is -5. But -5 mod101 is 96. So inverse is96.

Therefore, n≡35*96 mod101.

Compute 35*96:

35*96=35*(100 -4)=3500 -140=3360.

Now, 3360 divided by101:

101*33=3333, 3360 -3333=27. So 3360≡27 mod101. Therefore, n≡27 mod101.

Therefore, n=101m +27 for some integer m. Then x=20*(101m +27) +3=2020m +540 +3=2020m +543.

Therefore, the smallest non-negative solution is x=543 mod2020. Since 543 is less than 2020, the answer is543.

Wait, but let me check if 543^677 ≡3 mod2020. To verify, we can check modulo4,5,101.

First, modulo4: 543 mod4=543-4*135=543-540=3 mod4. Then 3^677≡3 mod4. Correct.

Modulo5:543 mod5=543-5*108=543-540=3 mod5. Then 3^677≡3 mod5 as earlier. Correct.

Modulo101:543 divided by101:101*5=505, 543-505=38. So 543≡38 mod101. Then 38^677 mod101. But as earlier, 38≡3^13 mod101, so 38^677=3^(13*677). Compute 13*677=8801. Now, since x^100≡1 mod101, reduce 8801 mod100. 8801 divided by100 is88 with remainder1. So 8801≡1 mod100. Therefore, 3^(8801)≡3^1≡3 mod101. So yes, 38^677≡3 mod101. Therefore, all congruences are satisfied.

Therefore, the answer is543.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{543}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \), we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) by solving the congruence modulo the prime power factors of 2020, which are \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 101 \).

1. **Modulo 4**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{4}
   \]
   Since \( 3 \equiv -1 \pmod{4} \) and any odd power of \(-1\) is \(-1\), we get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).

2. **Modulo 5**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{5}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 4 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \).

3. **Modulo 101**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{101}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^{100} \equiv 1 \pmod{101} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 100 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 77 \pmod{100} \). We need to solve \( x^{77} \equiv 3 \pmod{101} \). Finding the inverse of 77 modulo 100 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we get \( d = 13 \). Thus, \( x \equiv 3^{13} \pmod{101} \). Calculating \( 3^{13} \mod 101 \) gives \( 38 \), so \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \).

Combining these results using CRT:
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \) and \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) to get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \).
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \) with \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \). Solving \( 20n + 3 \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \) gives \( n \equiv 27 \pmod{101} \). Thus, \( x = 20 \cdot 27 + 3 = 543 \).

The smallest non-negative integer \( x \) that satisfies \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \) is \(\boxed{543}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find an integer x such that x raised to the 677th power is congruent to 3 modulo 2020. Hmm, that&#x27;s a pretty high exponent. Let me start by recalling some number theory concepts that might help here.

First, 2020 factors into prime components. Let me factorize 2020. 2020 divided by 2 is 1010, divided by 2 again is 505. Then 505 divided by 5 is 101, and 101 is a prime number. So, the prime factorization of 2020 is 2^2 * 5 * 101. So, modulus 2020 is composite, and since 2^2, 5, and 101 are pairwise coprime, maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to solve this congruence. That is, solve the congruence modulo each prime power factor separately and then combine the solutions.

So, if I can find x such that:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 101,

then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there will be a unique solution mod 2020, which is the product of 4, 5, and 101. So, solving each of these congruences separately and then combining them should give me the answer. Let me handle each modulus one by one.

Starting with mod 4:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4.

But modulo 4, the possible residues are 0, 1, 2, 3. Let&#x27;s see what their powers are.

However, 3 mod 4 is -1. So maybe x is congruent to -1 mod 4? Let&#x27;s check.

If x ≡ -1 mod 4, then x^677 ≡ (-1)^677 ≡ -1 ≡ 3 mod 4. That works. So x ≡ 3 mod 4. So that&#x27;s the solution modulo 4.

Wait, but are there other possibilities? Let&#x27;s check.

Suppose x ≡ 1 mod 4. Then x^677 ≡ 1 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 0 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 2 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4 (since 2^2 is 0 mod 4, and higher exponents are still 0). So 2 mod 4 raised to any power higher than 1 is 0 mod 4. So 2 is out. Similarly, 3 mod 4 raised to any odd power is 3 mod 4. So yes, only x ≡ 3 mod 4 works. So the solution for modulus 4 is 3 mod 4.

Next, modulo 5.

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5.

We can use Fermat&#x27;s little theorem here. Since 5 is prime, for any x not divisible by 5, x^(4) ≡ 1 mod 5. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 4.

677 divided by 4: 4*169=676, so 677=4*169 +1. So 677 ≡1 mod 4.

Therefore, x^677 ≡ x^1 ≡ x mod 5. Therefore, the equation simplifies to x ≡3 mod5. So the solution modulo 5 is x ≡3 mod5.

Now, modulus 101.

This seems trickier because 101 is a larger prime. Let&#x27;s see. We need to solve x^677 ≡3 mod101.

Again, using Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, since 101 is prime, x^100 ≡1 mod101 for x not divisible by 101. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 100. Let&#x27;s compute 677 divided by 100. 100*6=600, 677-600=77. So 677 ≡77 mod100. Therefore, x^677 ≡x^77 mod101. So the equation becomes x^77 ≡3 mod101.

So now we need to solve x^77 ≡3 mod101. Hmm. To solve for x, we might need to find the 77th root of 3 modulo 101. Since 101 is prime, perhaps we can find an integer k such that (x^k)^m ≡x mod101, where m is some exponent. Alternatively, maybe we can find an inverse of 77 modulo 100, since the multiplicative order is 100.

If we can find an integer d such that 77*d ≡1 mod100, then raising both sides of the congruence x^77 ≡3 mod101 to the dth power would give x ≡3^d mod101.

So let&#x27;s find d, the inverse of 77 modulo100.

To find d such that 77d ≡1 mod100.

We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Compute gcd(77,100):

100 =1*77 +23

77=3*23 +8

23=2*8 +7

8=1*7 +1

7=7*1 +0

So gcd is 1. Now backtracking:

1=8 -1*7

But 7=23 -2*8, so substitute:

1=8 -1*(23 -2*8)=3*8 -1*23

But 8=77 -3*23, so substitute:

1=3*(77 -3*23) -1*23=3*77 -10*23

But 23=100 -1*77, substitute:

1=3*77 -10*(100 -1*77)=13*77 -10*100

Therefore, 13*77 ≡1 mod100. So d=13. Therefore, the inverse of 77 mod100 is13.

Therefore, x ≡3^13 mod101. So compute 3^13 mod101.

Let me compute 3^13 step by step:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^4=(3^2)^2=81

3^8=(3^4)^2=81^2. Let&#x27;s compute 81^2 mod101.

81^2 = 6561. 6561 divided by 101: 101*64=6464, 6561-6464=97. So 3^8 ≡97 mod101.

3^13 =3^8 *3^4 *3^1 =97*81*3 mod101.

First compute 97*81 mod101.

Compute 97*81: 97*80=7760, plus 97=7857. Now divide 7857 by101:

101*77=7777, 7857-7777=80. So 97*81 ≡80 mod101.

Then multiply by 3: 80*3=240. 240 mod101: 101*2=202, 240-202=38. So 3^13 ≡38 mod101.

Therefore, x ≡38 mod101.

Wait, let me verify that 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But that might take a while. Alternatively, let&#x27;s check if 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But since we know that 38≡3^13 mod101, then 38^77 ≡(3^13)^77=3^(13*77). But 13*77=1001, which is 10*100 +1. Therefore, 3^(1001)≡(3^100)^10 *3^1 ≡1^10 *3 ≡3 mod101. So yes, that works. Therefore, 38^77 ≡3 mod101. So x≡38 mod101 is correct.

So putting it all together, we have:

x ≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5,

x≡38 mod101.

Now, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer x that satisfies all three congruences. Let&#x27;s use the Chinese Remainder Theorem step by step.

First, let&#x27;s combine the congruences modulo 4 and 5.

Find x such that:

x≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5.

Let me write x=4k +3 for some integer k. Substitute into the second congruence:

4k +3 ≡3 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5. Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod5. Since 4*4=16≡1 mod5, inverse of 4 is4. Therefore, k≡0*4≡0 mod5. So k=5m for some integer m. Therefore, x=4*(5m) +3=20m +3.

Thus, the solution to the first two congruences is x≡3 mod20.

Now, combine this with x≡38 mod101.

So now, we need to solve:

x≡3 mod20,

x≡38 mod101.

Let me express x as x=20n +3 for some integer n. Substitute into the second congruence:

20n +3 ≡38 mod101 =&gt; 20n ≡35 mod101. So 20n ≡35 mod101.

We need to solve for n: 20n ≡35 mod101. Let&#x27;s find the inverse of 20 mod101.

Use the extended Euclidean algorithm again.

Find integers a and b such that 20a +101b=1.

101=5*20 +1

20=20*1 +0

So backtracking:

1=101 -5*20

Therefore, inverse of 20 mod101 is -5. But -5 mod101 is 96. So inverse is96.

Therefore, n≡35*96 mod101.

Compute 35*96:

35*96=35*(100 -4)=3500 -140=3360.

Now, 3360 divided by101:

101*33=3333, 3360 -3333=27. So 3360≡27 mod101. Therefore, n≡27 mod101.

Therefore, n=101m +27 for some integer m. Then x=20*(101m +27) +3=2020m +540 +3=2020m +543.

Therefore, the smallest non-negative solution is x=543 mod2020. Since 543 is less than 2020, the answer is543.

Wait, but let me check if 543^677 ≡3 mod2020. To verify, we can check modulo4,5,101.

First, modulo4: 543 mod4=543-4*135=543-540=3 mod4. Then 3^677≡3 mod4. Correct.

Modulo5:543 mod5=543-5*108=543-540=3 mod5. Then 3^677≡3 mod5 as earlier. Correct.

Modulo101:543 divided by101:101*5=505, 543-505=38. So 543≡38 mod101. Then 38^677 mod101. But as earlier, 38≡3^13 mod101, so 38^677=3^(13*677). Compute 13*677=8801. Now, since x^100≡1 mod101, reduce 8801 mod100. 8801 divided by100 is88 with remainder1. So 8801≡1 mod100. Therefore, 3^(8801)≡3^1≡3 mod101. So yes, 38^677≡3 mod101. Therefore, all congruences are satisfied.

Therefore, the answer is543.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{543}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \), we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) by solving the congruence modulo the prime power factors of 2020, which are \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 101 \).

1. **Modulo 4**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{4}
   \]
   Since \( 3 \equiv -1 \pmod{4} \) and any odd power of \(-1\) is \(-1\), we get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).

2. **Modulo 5**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{5}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 4 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \).

3. **Modulo 101**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{101}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^{100} \equiv 1 \pmod{101} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 100 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 77 \pmod{100} \). We need to solve \( x^{77} \equiv 3 \pmod{101} \). Finding the inverse of 77 modulo 100 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we get \( d = 13 \). Thus, \( x \equiv 3^{13} \pmod{101} \). Calculating \( 3^{13} \mod 101 \) gives \( 38 \), so \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \).

Combining these results using CRT:
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \) and \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) to get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \).
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \) with \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \). Solving \( 20n + 3 \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \) gives \( n \equiv 27 \pmod{101} \). Thus, \( x = 20 \cdot 27 + 3 = 543 \).

The smallest non-negative integer \( x \) that satisfies \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \) is \(\boxed{543}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find an integer x such that x raised to the 677th power is congruent to 3 modulo 2020. Hmm, that&#x27;s a pretty high exponent. Let me start by recalling some number theory concepts that might help here.

First, 2020 factors into prime components. Let me factorize 2020. 2020 divided by 2 is 1010, divided by 2 again is 505. Then 505 divided by 5 is 101, and 101 is a prime number. So, the prime factorization of 2020 is 2^2 * 5 * 101. So, modulus 2020 is composite, and since 2^2, 5, and 101 are pairwise coprime, maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to solve this congruence. That is, solve the congruence modulo each prime power factor separately and then combine the solutions.

So, if I can find x such that:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 101,

then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there will be a unique solution mod 2020, which is the product of 4, 5, and 101. So, solving each of these congruences separately and then combining them should give me the answer. Let me handle each modulus one by one.

Starting with mod 4:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4.

But modulo 4, the possible residues are 0, 1, 2, 3. Let&#x27;s see what their powers are.

However, 3 mod 4 is -1. So maybe x is congruent to -1 mod 4? Let&#x27;s check.

If x ≡ -1 mod 4, then x^677 ≡ (-1)^677 ≡ -1 ≡ 3 mod 4. That works. So x ≡ 3 mod 4. So that&#x27;s the solution modulo 4.

Wait, but are there other possibilities? Let&#x27;s check.

Suppose x ≡ 1 mod 4. Then x^677 ≡ 1 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 0 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 2 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4 (since 2^2 is 0 mod 4, and higher exponents are still 0). So 2 mod 4 raised to any power higher than 1 is 0 mod 4. So 2 is out. Similarly, 3 mod 4 raised to any odd power is 3 mod 4. So yes, only x ≡ 3 mod 4 works. So the solution for modulus 4 is 3 mod 4.

Next, modulo 5.

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5.

We can use Fermat&#x27;s little theorem here. Since 5 is prime, for any x not divisible by 5, x^(4) ≡ 1 mod 5. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 4.

677 divided by 4: 4*169=676, so 677=4*169 +1. So 677 ≡1 mod 4.

Therefore, x^677 ≡ x^1 ≡ x mod 5. Therefore, the equation simplifies to x ≡3 mod5. So the solution modulo 5 is x ≡3 mod5.

Now, modulus 101.

This seems trickier because 101 is a larger prime. Let&#x27;s see. We need to solve x^677 ≡3 mod101.

Again, using Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, since 101 is prime, x^100 ≡1 mod101 for x not divisible by 101. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 100. Let&#x27;s compute 677 divided by 100. 100*6=600, 677-600=77. So 677 ≡77 mod100. Therefore, x^677 ≡x^77 mod101. So the equation becomes x^77 ≡3 mod101.

So now we need to solve x^77 ≡3 mod101. Hmm. To solve for x, we might need to find the 77th root of 3 modulo 101. Since 101 is prime, perhaps we can find an integer k such that (x^k)^m ≡x mod101, where m is some exponent. Alternatively, maybe we can find an inverse of 77 modulo 100, since the multiplicative order is 100.

If we can find an integer d such that 77*d ≡1 mod100, then raising both sides of the congruence x^77 ≡3 mod101 to the dth power would give x ≡3^d mod101.

So let&#x27;s find d, the inverse of 77 modulo100.

To find d such that 77d ≡1 mod100.

We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Compute gcd(77,100):

100 =1*77 +23

77=3*23 +8

23=2*8 +7

8=1*7 +1

7=7*1 +0

So gcd is 1. Now backtracking:

1=8 -1*7

But 7=23 -2*8, so substitute:

1=8 -1*(23 -2*8)=3*8 -1*23

But 8=77 -3*23, so substitute:

1=3*(77 -3*23) -1*23=3*77 -10*23

But 23=100 -1*77, substitute:

1=3*77 -10*(100 -1*77)=13*77 -10*100

Therefore, 13*77 ≡1 mod100. So d=13. Therefore, the inverse of 77 mod100 is13.

Therefore, x ≡3^13 mod101. So compute 3^13 mod101.

Let me compute 3^13 step by step:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^4=(3^2)^2=81

3^8=(3^4)^2=81^2. Let&#x27;s compute 81^2 mod101.

81^2 = 6561. 6561 divided by 101: 101*64=6464, 6561-6464=97. So 3^8 ≡97 mod101.

3^13 =3^8 *3^4 *3^1 =97*81*3 mod101.

First compute 97*81 mod101.

Compute 97*81: 97*80=7760, plus 97=7857. Now divide 7857 by101:

101*77=7777, 7857-7777=80. So 97*81 ≡80 mod101.

Then multiply by 3: 80*3=240. 240 mod101: 101*2=202, 240-202=38. So 3^13 ≡38 mod101.

Therefore, x ≡38 mod101.

Wait, let me verify that 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But that might take a while. Alternatively, let&#x27;s check if 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But since we know that 38≡3^13 mod101, then 38^77 ≡(3^13)^77=3^(13*77). But 13*77=1001, which is 10*100 +1. Therefore, 3^(1001)≡(3^100)^10 *3^1 ≡1^10 *3 ≡3 mod101. So yes, that works. Therefore, 38^77 ≡3 mod101. So x≡38 mod101 is correct.

So putting it all together, we have:

x ≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5,

x≡38 mod101.

Now, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer x that satisfies all three congruences. Let&#x27;s use the Chinese Remainder Theorem step by step.

First, let&#x27;s combine the congruences modulo 4 and 5.

Find x such that:

x≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5.

Let me write x=4k +3 for some integer k. Substitute into the second congruence:

4k +3 ≡3 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5. Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod5. Since 4*4=16≡1 mod5, inverse of 4 is4. Therefore, k≡0*4≡0 mod5. So k=5m for some integer m. Therefore, x=4*(5m) +3=20m +3.

Thus, the solution to the first two congruences is x≡3 mod20.

Now, combine this with x≡38 mod101.

So now, we need to solve:

x≡3 mod20,

x≡38 mod101.

Let me express x as x=20n +3 for some integer n. Substitute into the second congruence:

20n +3 ≡38 mod101 =&gt; 20n ≡35 mod101. So 20n ≡35 mod101.

We need to solve for n: 20n ≡35 mod101. Let&#x27;s find the inverse of 20 mod101.

Use the extended Euclidean algorithm again.

Find integers a and b such that 20a +101b=1.

101=5*20 +1

20=20*1 +0

So backtracking:

1=101 -5*20

Therefore, inverse of 20 mod101 is -5. But -5 mod101 is 96. So inverse is96.

Therefore, n≡35*96 mod101.

Compute 35*96:

35*96=35*(100 -4)=3500 -140=3360.

Now, 3360 divided by101:

101*33=3333, 3360 -3333=27. So 3360≡27 mod101. Therefore, n≡27 mod101.

Therefore, n=101m +27 for some integer m. Then x=20*(101m +27) +3=2020m +540 +3=2020m +543.

Therefore, the smallest non-negative solution is x=543 mod2020. Since 543 is less than 2020, the answer is543.

Wait, but let me check if 543^677 ≡3 mod2020. To verify, we can check modulo4,5,101.

First, modulo4: 543 mod4=543-4*135=543-540=3 mod4. Then 3^677≡3 mod4. Correct.

Modulo5:543 mod5=543-5*108=543-540=3 mod5. Then 3^677≡3 mod5 as earlier. Correct.

Modulo101:543 divided by101:101*5=505, 543-505=38. So 543≡38 mod101. Then 38^677 mod101. But as earlier, 38≡3^13 mod101, so 38^677=3^(13*677). Compute 13*677=8801. Now, since x^100≡1 mod101, reduce 8801 mod100. 8801 divided by100 is88 with remainder1. So 8801≡1 mod100. Therefore, 3^(8801)≡3^1≡3 mod101. So yes, 38^677≡3 mod101. Therefore, all congruences are satisfied.

Therefore, the answer is543.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{543}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \), we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) by solving the congruence modulo the prime power factors of 2020, which are \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 101 \).

1. **Modulo 4**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{4}
   \]
   Since \( 3 \equiv -1 \pmod{4} \) and any odd power of \(-1\) is \(-1\), we get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).

2. **Modulo 5**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{5}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 4 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \).

3. **Modulo 101**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{101}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^{100} \equiv 1 \pmod{101} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 100 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 77 \pmod{100} \). We need to solve \( x^{77} \equiv 3 \pmod{101} \). Finding the inverse of 77 modulo 100 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we get \( d = 13 \). Thus, \( x \equiv 3^{13} \pmod{101} \). Calculating \( 3^{13} \mod 101 \) gives \( 38 \), so \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \).

Combining these results using CRT:
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \) and \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) to get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \).
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \) with \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \). Solving \( 20n + 3 \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \) gives \( n \equiv 27 \pmod{101} \). Thus, \( x = 20 \cdot 27 + 3 = 543 \).

The smallest non-negative integer \( x \) that satisfies \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \) is \(\boxed{543}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find an integer x such that x raised to the 677th power is congruent to 3 modulo 2020. Hmm, that&#x27;s a pretty high exponent. Let me start by recalling some number theory concepts that might help here.

First, 2020 factors into prime components. Let me factorize 2020. 2020 divided by 2 is 1010, divided by 2 again is 505. Then 505 divided by 5 is 101, and 101 is a prime number. So, the prime factorization of 2020 is 2^2 * 5 * 101. So, modulus 2020 is composite, and since 2^2, 5, and 101 are pairwise coprime, maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to solve this congruence. That is, solve the congruence modulo each prime power factor separately and then combine the solutions.

So, if I can find x such that:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 101,

then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there will be a unique solution mod 2020, which is the product of 4, 5, and 101. So, solving each of these congruences separately and then combining them should give me the answer. Let me handle each modulus one by one.

Starting with mod 4:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4.

But modulo 4, the possible residues are 0, 1, 2, 3. Let&#x27;s see what their powers are.

However, 3 mod 4 is -1. So maybe x is congruent to -1 mod 4? Let&#x27;s check.

If x ≡ -1 mod 4, then x^677 ≡ (-1)^677 ≡ -1 ≡ 3 mod 4. That works. So x ≡ 3 mod 4. So that&#x27;s the solution modulo 4.

Wait, but are there other possibilities? Let&#x27;s check.

Suppose x ≡ 1 mod 4. Then x^677 ≡ 1 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 0 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 2 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4 (since 2^2 is 0 mod 4, and higher exponents are still 0). So 2 mod 4 raised to any power higher than 1 is 0 mod 4. So 2 is out. Similarly, 3 mod 4 raised to any odd power is 3 mod 4. So yes, only x ≡ 3 mod 4 works. So the solution for modulus 4 is 3 mod 4.

Next, modulo 5.

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5.

We can use Fermat&#x27;s little theorem here. Since 5 is prime, for any x not divisible by 5, x^(4) ≡ 1 mod 5. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 4.

677 divided by 4: 4*169=676, so 677=4*169 +1. So 677 ≡1 mod 4.

Therefore, x^677 ≡ x^1 ≡ x mod 5. Therefore, the equation simplifies to x ≡3 mod5. So the solution modulo 5 is x ≡3 mod5.

Now, modulus 101.

This seems trickier because 101 is a larger prime. Let&#x27;s see. We need to solve x^677 ≡3 mod101.

Again, using Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, since 101 is prime, x^100 ≡1 mod101 for x not divisible by 101. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 100. Let&#x27;s compute 677 divided by 100. 100*6=600, 677-600=77. So 677 ≡77 mod100. Therefore, x^677 ≡x^77 mod101. So the equation becomes x^77 ≡3 mod101.

So now we need to solve x^77 ≡3 mod101. Hmm. To solve for x, we might need to find the 77th root of 3 modulo 101. Since 101 is prime, perhaps we can find an integer k such that (x^k)^m ≡x mod101, where m is some exponent. Alternatively, maybe we can find an inverse of 77 modulo 100, since the multiplicative order is 100.

If we can find an integer d such that 77*d ≡1 mod100, then raising both sides of the congruence x^77 ≡3 mod101 to the dth power would give x ≡3^d mod101.

So let&#x27;s find d, the inverse of 77 modulo100.

To find d such that 77d ≡1 mod100.

We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Compute gcd(77,100):

100 =1*77 +23

77=3*23 +8

23=2*8 +7

8=1*7 +1

7=7*1 +0

So gcd is 1. Now backtracking:

1=8 -1*7

But 7=23 -2*8, so substitute:

1=8 -1*(23 -2*8)=3*8 -1*23

But 8=77 -3*23, so substitute:

1=3*(77 -3*23) -1*23=3*77 -10*23

But 23=100 -1*77, substitute:

1=3*77 -10*(100 -1*77)=13*77 -10*100

Therefore, 13*77 ≡1 mod100. So d=13. Therefore, the inverse of 77 mod100 is13.

Therefore, x ≡3^13 mod101. So compute 3^13 mod101.

Let me compute 3^13 step by step:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^4=(3^2)^2=81

3^8=(3^4)^2=81^2. Let&#x27;s compute 81^2 mod101.

81^2 = 6561. 6561 divided by 101: 101*64=6464, 6561-6464=97. So 3^8 ≡97 mod101.

3^13 =3^8 *3^4 *3^1 =97*81*3 mod101.

First compute 97*81 mod101.

Compute 97*81: 97*80=7760, plus 97=7857. Now divide 7857 by101:

101*77=7777, 7857-7777=80. So 97*81 ≡80 mod101.

Then multiply by 3: 80*3=240. 240 mod101: 101*2=202, 240-202=38. So 3^13 ≡38 mod101.

Therefore, x ≡38 mod101.

Wait, let me verify that 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But that might take a while. Alternatively, let&#x27;s check if 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But since we know that 38≡3^13 mod101, then 38^77 ≡(3^13)^77=3^(13*77). But 13*77=1001, which is 10*100 +1. Therefore, 3^(1001)≡(3^100)^10 *3^1 ≡1^10 *3 ≡3 mod101. So yes, that works. Therefore, 38^77 ≡3 mod101. So x≡38 mod101 is correct.

So putting it all together, we have:

x ≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5,

x≡38 mod101.

Now, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer x that satisfies all three congruences. Let&#x27;s use the Chinese Remainder Theorem step by step.

First, let&#x27;s combine the congruences modulo 4 and 5.

Find x such that:

x≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5.

Let me write x=4k +3 for some integer k. Substitute into the second congruence:

4k +3 ≡3 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5. Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod5. Since 4*4=16≡1 mod5, inverse of 4 is4. Therefore, k≡0*4≡0 mod5. So k=5m for some integer m. Therefore, x=4*(5m) +3=20m +3.

Thus, the solution to the first two congruences is x≡3 mod20.

Now, combine this with x≡38 mod101.

So now, we need to solve:

x≡3 mod20,

x≡38 mod101.

Let me express x as x=20n +3 for some integer n. Substitute into the second congruence:

20n +3 ≡38 mod101 =&gt; 20n ≡35 mod101. So 20n ≡35 mod101.

We need to solve for n: 20n ≡35 mod101. Let&#x27;s find the inverse of 20 mod101.

Use the extended Euclidean algorithm again.

Find integers a and b such that 20a +101b=1.

101=5*20 +1

20=20*1 +0

So backtracking:

1=101 -5*20

Therefore, inverse of 20 mod101 is -5. But -5 mod101 is 96. So inverse is96.

Therefore, n≡35*96 mod101.

Compute 35*96:

35*96=35*(100 -4)=3500 -140=3360.

Now, 3360 divided by101:

101*33=3333, 3360 -3333=27. So 3360≡27 mod101. Therefore, n≡27 mod101.

Therefore, n=101m +27 for some integer m. Then x=20*(101m +27) +3=2020m +540 +3=2020m +543.

Therefore, the smallest non-negative solution is x=543 mod2020. Since 543 is less than 2020, the answer is543.

Wait, but let me check if 543^677 ≡3 mod2020. To verify, we can check modulo4,5,101.

First, modulo4: 543 mod4=543-4*135=543-540=3 mod4. Then 3^677≡3 mod4. Correct.

Modulo5:543 mod5=543-5*108=543-540=3 mod5. Then 3^677≡3 mod5 as earlier. Correct.

Modulo101:543 divided by101:101*5=505, 543-505=38. So 543≡38 mod101. Then 38^677 mod101. But as earlier, 38≡3^13 mod101, so 38^677=3^(13*677). Compute 13*677=8801. Now, since x^100≡1 mod101, reduce 8801 mod100. 8801 divided by100 is88 with remainder1. So 8801≡1 mod100. Therefore, 3^(8801)≡3^1≡3 mod101. So yes, 38^677≡3 mod101. Therefore, all congruences are satisfied.

Therefore, the answer is543.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{543}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \), we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) by solving the congruence modulo the prime power factors of 2020, which are \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 101 \).

1. **Modulo 4**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{4}
   \]
   Since \( 3 \equiv -1 \pmod{4} \) and any odd power of \(-1\) is \(-1\), we get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).

2. **Modulo 5**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{5}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 4 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \).

3. **Modulo 101**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{101}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^{100} \equiv 1 \pmod{101} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 100 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 77 \pmod{100} \). We need to solve \( x^{77} \equiv 3 \pmod{101} \). Finding the inverse of 77 modulo 100 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we get \( d = 13 \). Thus, \( x \equiv 3^{13} \pmod{101} \). Calculating \( 3^{13} \mod 101 \) gives \( 38 \), so \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \).

Combining these results using CRT:
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \) and \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) to get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \).
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \) with \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \). Solving \( 20n + 3 \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \) gives \( n \equiv 27 \pmod{101} \). Thus, \( x = 20 \cdot 27 + 3 = 543 \).

The smallest non-negative integer \( x \) that satisfies \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \) is \(\boxed{543}\).          </p>

Response: Hint: $6 \cdot 7 = 42$. To check whether $x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020}$, we try a little experiment, using the smallest possible solutions. Let&#x27;s start with $x \equiv 3 \pmod{2020}$.

Based on your work, are the smallest non-negative solutions $\boxed{\{22899, 782660\}}$? This is a division problem, can you divide $2020$ by $1$ and also find $0$?          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find an integer x such that x raised to the 677th power is congruent to 3 modulo 2020. Hmm, that&#x27;s a pretty high exponent. Let me start by recalling some number theory concepts that might help here.

First, 2020 factors into prime components. Let me factorize 2020. 2020 divided by 2 is 1010, divided by 2 again is 505. Then 505 divided by 5 is 101, and 101 is a prime number. So, the prime factorization of 2020 is 2^2 * 5 * 101. So, modulus 2020 is composite, and since 2^2, 5, and 101 are pairwise coprime, maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to solve this congruence. That is, solve the congruence modulo each prime power factor separately and then combine the solutions.

So, if I can find x such that:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 101,

then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there will be a unique solution mod 2020, which is the product of 4, 5, and 101. So, solving each of these congruences separately and then combining them should give me the answer. Let me handle each modulus one by one.

Starting with mod 4:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4.

But modulo 4, the possible residues are 0, 1, 2, 3. Let&#x27;s see what their powers are.

However, 3 mod 4 is -1. So maybe x is congruent to -1 mod 4? Let&#x27;s check.

If x ≡ -1 mod 4, then x^677 ≡ (-1)^677 ≡ -1 ≡ 3 mod 4. That works. So x ≡ 3 mod 4. So that&#x27;s the solution modulo 4.

Wait, but are there other possibilities? Let&#x27;s check.

Suppose x ≡ 1 mod 4. Then x^677 ≡ 1 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 0 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 2 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4 (since 2^2 is 0 mod 4, and higher exponents are still 0). So 2 mod 4 raised to any power higher than 1 is 0 mod 4. So 2 is out. Similarly, 3 mod 4 raised to any odd power is 3 mod 4. So yes, only x ≡ 3 mod 4 works. So the solution for modulus 4 is 3 mod 4.

Next, modulo 5.

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5.

We can use Fermat&#x27;s little theorem here. Since 5 is prime, for any x not divisible by 5, x^(4) ≡ 1 mod 5. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 4.

677 divided by 4: 4*169=676, so 677=4*169 +1. So 677 ≡1 mod 4.

Therefore, x^677 ≡ x^1 ≡ x mod 5. Therefore, the equation simplifies to x ≡3 mod5. So the solution modulo 5 is x ≡3 mod5.

Now, modulus 101.

This seems trickier because 101 is a larger prime. Let&#x27;s see. We need to solve x^677 ≡3 mod101.

Again, using Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, since 101 is prime, x^100 ≡1 mod101 for x not divisible by 101. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 100. Let&#x27;s compute 677 divided by 100. 100*6=600, 677-600=77. So 677 ≡77 mod100. Therefore, x^677 ≡x^77 mod101. So the equation becomes x^77 ≡3 mod101.

So now we need to solve x^77 ≡3 mod101. Hmm. To solve for x, we might need to find the 77th root of 3 modulo 101. Since 101 is prime, perhaps we can find an integer k such that (x^k)^m ≡x mod101, where m is some exponent. Alternatively, maybe we can find an inverse of 77 modulo 100, since the multiplicative order is 100.

If we can find an integer d such that 77*d ≡1 mod100, then raising both sides of the congruence x^77 ≡3 mod101 to the dth power would give x ≡3^d mod101.

So let&#x27;s find d, the inverse of 77 modulo100.

To find d such that 77d ≡1 mod100.

We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Compute gcd(77,100):

100 =1*77 +23

77=3*23 +8

23=2*8 +7

8=1*7 +1

7=7*1 +0

So gcd is 1. Now backtracking:

1=8 -1*7

But 7=23 -2*8, so substitute:

1=8 -1*(23 -2*8)=3*8 -1*23

But 8=77 -3*23, so substitute:

1=3*(77 -3*23) -1*23=3*77 -10*23

But 23=100 -1*77, substitute:

1=3*77 -10*(100 -1*77)=13*77 -10*100

Therefore, 13*77 ≡1 mod100. So d=13. Therefore, the inverse of 77 mod100 is13.

Therefore, x ≡3^13 mod101. So compute 3^13 mod101.

Let me compute 3^13 step by step:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^4=(3^2)^2=81

3^8=(3^4)^2=81^2. Let&#x27;s compute 81^2 mod101.

81^2 = 6561. 6561 divided by 101: 101*64=6464, 6561-6464=97. So 3^8 ≡97 mod101.

3^13 =3^8 *3^4 *3^1 =97*81*3 mod101.

First compute 97*81 mod101.

Compute 97*81: 97*80=7760, plus 97=7857. Now divide 7857 by101:

101*77=7777, 7857-7777=80. So 97*81 ≡80 mod101.

Then multiply by 3: 80*3=240. 240 mod101: 101*2=202, 240-202=38. So 3^13 ≡38 mod101.

Therefore, x ≡38 mod101.

Wait, let me verify that 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But that might take a while. Alternatively, let&#x27;s check if 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But since we know that 38≡3^13 mod101, then 38^77 ≡(3^13)^77=3^(13*77). But 13*77=1001, which is 10*100 +1. Therefore, 3^(1001)≡(3^100)^10 *3^1 ≡1^10 *3 ≡3 mod101. So yes, that works. Therefore, 38^77 ≡3 mod101. So x≡38 mod101 is correct.

So putting it all together, we have:

x ≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5,

x≡38 mod101.

Now, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer x that satisfies all three congruences. Let&#x27;s use the Chinese Remainder Theorem step by step.

First, let&#x27;s combine the congruences modulo 4 and 5.

Find x such that:

x≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5.

Let me write x=4k +3 for some integer k. Substitute into the second congruence:

4k +3 ≡3 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5. Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod5. Since 4*4=16≡1 mod5, inverse of 4 is4. Therefore, k≡0*4≡0 mod5. So k=5m for some integer m. Therefore, x=4*(5m) +3=20m +3.

Thus, the solution to the first two congruences is x≡3 mod20.

Now, combine this with x≡38 mod101.

So now, we need to solve:

x≡3 mod20,

x≡38 mod101.

Let me express x as x=20n +3 for some integer n. Substitute into the second congruence:

20n +3 ≡38 mod101 =&gt; 20n ≡35 mod101. So 20n ≡35 mod101.

We need to solve for n: 20n ≡35 mod101. Let&#x27;s find the inverse of 20 mod101.

Use the extended Euclidean algorithm again.

Find integers a and b such that 20a +101b=1.

101=5*20 +1

20=20*1 +0

So backtracking:

1=101 -5*20

Therefore, inverse of 20 mod101 is -5. But -5 mod101 is 96. So inverse is96.

Therefore, n≡35*96 mod101.

Compute 35*96:

35*96=35*(100 -4)=3500 -140=3360.

Now, 3360 divided by101:

101*33=3333, 3360 -3333=27. So 3360≡27 mod101. Therefore, n≡27 mod101.

Therefore, n=101m +27 for some integer m. Then x=20*(101m +27) +3=2020m +540 +3=2020m +543.

Therefore, the smallest non-negative solution is x=543 mod2020. Since 543 is less than 2020, the answer is543.

Wait, but let me check if 543^677 ≡3 mod2020. To verify, we can check modulo4,5,101.

First, modulo4: 543 mod4=543-4*135=543-540=3 mod4. Then 3^677≡3 mod4. Correct.

Modulo5:543 mod5=543-5*108=543-540=3 mod5. Then 3^677≡3 mod5 as earlier. Correct.

Modulo101:543 divided by101:101*5=505, 543-505=38. So 543≡38 mod101. Then 38^677 mod101. But as earlier, 38≡3^13 mod101, so 38^677=3^(13*677). Compute 13*677=8801. Now, since x^100≡1 mod101, reduce 8801 mod100. 8801 divided by100 is88 with remainder1. So 8801≡1 mod100. Therefore, 3^(8801)≡3^1≡3 mod101. So yes, 38^677≡3 mod101. Therefore, all congruences are satisfied.

Therefore, the answer is543.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{543}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \), we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) by solving the congruence modulo the prime power factors of 2020, which are \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 101 \).

1. **Modulo 4**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{4}
   \]
   Since \( 3 \equiv -1 \pmod{4} \) and any odd power of \(-1\) is \(-1\), we get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).

2. **Modulo 5**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{5}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 4 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \).

3. **Modulo 101**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{101}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^{100} \equiv 1 \pmod{101} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 100 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 77 \pmod{100} \). We need to solve \( x^{77} \equiv 3 \pmod{101} \). Finding the inverse of 77 modulo 100 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we get \( d = 13 \). Thus, \( x \equiv 3^{13} \pmod{101} \). Calculating \( 3^{13} \mod 101 \) gives \( 38 \), so \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \).

Combining these results using CRT:
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \) and \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) to get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \).
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \) with \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \). Solving \( 20n + 3 \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \) gives \( n \equiv 27 \pmod{101} \). Thus, \( x = 20 \cdot 27 + 3 = 543 \).

The smallest non-negative integer \( x \) that satisfies \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \) is \(\boxed{543}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find an integer x such that x raised to the 677th power is congruent to 3 modulo 2020. Hmm, that&#x27;s a pretty high exponent. Let me start by recalling some number theory concepts that might help here.

First, 2020 factors into prime components. Let me factorize 2020. 2020 divided by 2 is 1010, divided by 2 again is 505. Then 505 divided by 5 is 101, and 101 is a prime number. So, the prime factorization of 2020 is 2^2 * 5 * 101. So, modulus 2020 is composite, and since 2^2, 5, and 101 are pairwise coprime, maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to solve this congruence. That is, solve the congruence modulo each prime power factor separately and then combine the solutions.

So, if I can find x such that:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 101,

then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there will be a unique solution mod 2020, which is the product of 4, 5, and 101. So, solving each of these congruences separately and then combining them should give me the answer. Let me handle each modulus one by one.

Starting with mod 4:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4.

But modulo 4, the possible residues are 0, 1, 2, 3. Let&#x27;s see what their powers are.

However, 3 mod 4 is -1. So maybe x is congruent to -1 mod 4? Let&#x27;s check.

If x ≡ -1 mod 4, then x^677 ≡ (-1)^677 ≡ -1 ≡ 3 mod 4. That works. So x ≡ 3 mod 4. So that&#x27;s the solution modulo 4.

Wait, but are there other possibilities? Let&#x27;s check.

Suppose x ≡ 1 mod 4. Then x^677 ≡ 1 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 0 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 2 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4 (since 2^2 is 0 mod 4, and higher exponents are still 0). So 2 mod 4 raised to any power higher than 1 is 0 mod 4. So 2 is out. Similarly, 3 mod 4 raised to any odd power is 3 mod 4. So yes, only x ≡ 3 mod 4 works. So the solution for modulus 4 is 3 mod 4.

Next, modulo 5.

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5.

We can use Fermat&#x27;s little theorem here. Since 5 is prime, for any x not divisible by 5, x^(4) ≡ 1 mod 5. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 4.

677 divided by 4: 4*169=676, so 677=4*169 +1. So 677 ≡1 mod 4.

Therefore, x^677 ≡ x^1 ≡ x mod 5. Therefore, the equation simplifies to x ≡3 mod5. So the solution modulo 5 is x ≡3 mod5.

Now, modulus 101.

This seems trickier because 101 is a larger prime. Let&#x27;s see. We need to solve x^677 ≡3 mod101.

Again, using Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, since 101 is prime, x^100 ≡1 mod101 for x not divisible by 101. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 100. Let&#x27;s compute 677 divided by 100. 100*6=600, 677-600=77. So 677 ≡77 mod100. Therefore, x^677 ≡x^77 mod101. So the equation becomes x^77 ≡3 mod101.

So now we need to solve x^77 ≡3 mod101. Hmm. To solve for x, we might need to find the 77th root of 3 modulo 101. Since 101 is prime, perhaps we can find an integer k such that (x^k)^m ≡x mod101, where m is some exponent. Alternatively, maybe we can find an inverse of 77 modulo 100, since the multiplicative order is 100.

If we can find an integer d such that 77*d ≡1 mod100, then raising both sides of the congruence x^77 ≡3 mod101 to the dth power would give x ≡3^d mod101.

So let&#x27;s find d, the inverse of 77 modulo100.

To find d such that 77d ≡1 mod100.

We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Compute gcd(77,100):

100 =1*77 +23

77=3*23 +8

23=2*8 +7

8=1*7 +1

7=7*1 +0

So gcd is 1. Now backtracking:

1=8 -1*7

But 7=23 -2*8, so substitute:

1=8 -1*(23 -2*8)=3*8 -1*23

But 8=77 -3*23, so substitute:

1=3*(77 -3*23) -1*23=3*77 -10*23

But 23=100 -1*77, substitute:

1=3*77 -10*(100 -1*77)=13*77 -10*100

Therefore, 13*77 ≡1 mod100. So d=13. Therefore, the inverse of 77 mod100 is13.

Therefore, x ≡3^13 mod101. So compute 3^13 mod101.

Let me compute 3^13 step by step:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^4=(3^2)^2=81

3^8=(3^4)^2=81^2. Let&#x27;s compute 81^2 mod101.

81^2 = 6561. 6561 divided by 101: 101*64=6464, 6561-6464=97. So 3^8 ≡97 mod101.

3^13 =3^8 *3^4 *3^1 =97*81*3 mod101.

First compute 97*81 mod101.

Compute 97*81: 97*80=7760, plus 97=7857. Now divide 7857 by101:

101*77=7777, 7857-7777=80. So 97*81 ≡80 mod101.

Then multiply by 3: 80*3=240. 240 mod101: 101*2=202, 240-202=38. So 3^13 ≡38 mod101.

Therefore, x ≡38 mod101.

Wait, let me verify that 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But that might take a while. Alternatively, let&#x27;s check if 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But since we know that 38≡3^13 mod101, then 38^77 ≡(3^13)^77=3^(13*77). But 13*77=1001, which is 10*100 +1. Therefore, 3^(1001)≡(3^100)^10 *3^1 ≡1^10 *3 ≡3 mod101. So yes, that works. Therefore, 38^77 ≡3 mod101. So x≡38 mod101 is correct.

So putting it all together, we have:

x ≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5,

x≡38 mod101.

Now, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer x that satisfies all three congruences. Let&#x27;s use the Chinese Remainder Theorem step by step.

First, let&#x27;s combine the congruences modulo 4 and 5.

Find x such that:

x≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5.

Let me write x=4k +3 for some integer k. Substitute into the second congruence:

4k +3 ≡3 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5. Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod5. Since 4*4=16≡1 mod5, inverse of 4 is4. Therefore, k≡0*4≡0 mod5. So k=5m for some integer m. Therefore, x=4*(5m) +3=20m +3.

Thus, the solution to the first two congruences is x≡3 mod20.

Now, combine this with x≡38 mod101.

So now, we need to solve:

x≡3 mod20,

x≡38 mod101.

Let me express x as x=20n +3 for some integer n. Substitute into the second congruence:

20n +3 ≡38 mod101 =&gt; 20n ≡35 mod101. So 20n ≡35 mod101.

We need to solve for n: 20n ≡35 mod101. Let&#x27;s find the inverse of 20 mod101.

Use the extended Euclidean algorithm again.

Find integers a and b such that 20a +101b=1.

101=5*20 +1

20=20*1 +0

So backtracking:

1=101 -5*20

Therefore, inverse of 20 mod101 is -5. But -5 mod101 is 96. So inverse is96.

Therefore, n≡35*96 mod101.

Compute 35*96:

35*96=35*(100 -4)=3500 -140=3360.

Now, 3360 divided by101:

101*33=3333, 3360 -3333=27. So 3360≡27 mod101. Therefore, n≡27 mod101.

Therefore, n=101m +27 for some integer m. Then x=20*(101m +27) +3=2020m +540 +3=2020m +543.

Therefore, the smallest non-negative solution is x=543 mod2020. Since 543 is less than 2020, the answer is543.

Wait, but let me check if 543^677 ≡3 mod2020. To verify, we can check modulo4,5,101.

First, modulo4: 543 mod4=543-4*135=543-540=3 mod4. Then 3^677≡3 mod4. Correct.

Modulo5:543 mod5=543-5*108=543-540=3 mod5. Then 3^677≡3 mod5 as earlier. Correct.

Modulo101:543 divided by101:101*5=505, 543-505=38. So 543≡38 mod101. Then 38^677 mod101. But as earlier, 38≡3^13 mod101, so 38^677=3^(13*677). Compute 13*677=8801. Now, since x^100≡1 mod101, reduce 8801 mod100. 8801 divided by100 is88 with remainder1. So 8801≡1 mod100. Therefore, 3^(8801)≡3^1≡3 mod101. So yes, 38^677≡3 mod101. Therefore, all congruences are satisfied.

Therefore, the answer is543.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{543}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \), we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) by solving the congruence modulo the prime power factors of 2020, which are \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 101 \).

1. **Modulo 4**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{4}
   \]
   Since \( 3 \equiv -1 \pmod{4} \) and any odd power of \(-1\) is \(-1\), we get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).

2. **Modulo 5**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{5}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 4 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \).

3. **Modulo 101**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{101}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^{100} \equiv 1 \pmod{101} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 100 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 77 \pmod{100} \). We need to solve \( x^{77} \equiv 3 \pmod{101} \). Finding the inverse of 77 modulo 100 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we get \( d = 13 \). Thus, \( x \equiv 3^{13} \pmod{101} \). Calculating \( 3^{13} \mod 101 \) gives \( 38 \), so \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \).

Combining these results using CRT:
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \) and \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) to get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \).
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \) with \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \). Solving \( 20n + 3 \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \) gives \( n \equiv 27 \pmod{101} \). Thus, \( x = 20 \cdot 27 + 3 = 543 \).

The smallest non-negative integer \( x \) that satisfies \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \) is \(\boxed{543}\).          </p>

Response: Let&#x27;s think about how the nine prime factors of 2020 divide the numbers 677 and 3. The prime factor 2 divides 677, so let $x=677/2$ for now. We know we must have $x^{676}$ mod 2020 = 1 mod 2 and substituting 2 for 2020 provides the equation $x^{676}$ mod 2 = 0. Now we see that $2^{676}$ is divisible by $2^{278}$, so let $x=677/2^{278}$ for now. We need $x^{630}$ mod 2020 to be -1, or -1 mod 2. $2^{630}$ = (2^{{\left\lceil \frac{630}{281} \right\rceil}{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}}{\left\lceil \frac{630}{281} \right\rceil}{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}}^{\left\lceil {\left(630-{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}\right)}{\left/ {\left(30-{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}\right)}\right\rceil}}))1^{\left\lceil {\left(630-{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}\right)}{\left/ {\left(30-{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}\right)}\right\rceil}}))1^{\left\lceil {\left(30-{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}\right)}{\left/ {\left(10-{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}\right)}\right\rceil}}))1^{\left\lceil {\left(30-{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}\right)}{\left/ \left\lceil \frac{30-{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}}{\left(10-{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}\right)}\right\rceil}\right\rceil}}))0^{\left\lceil {\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}{\left/ \left\lceil \frac{30-{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}}{\left(10-{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}{\left\lfloor \frac{630}{281} \right\rfloor}\right)}\right\rceil}\right\rceil}})=63 mod 2020

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find an integer x such that x raised to the 677th power is congruent to 3 modulo 2020. Hmm, that&#x27;s a pretty high exponent. Let me start by recalling some number theory concepts that might help here.

First, 2020 factors into prime components. Let me factorize 2020. 2020 divided by 2 is 1010, divided by 2 again is 505. Then 505 divided by 5 is 101, and 101 is a prime number. So, the prime factorization of 2020 is 2^2 * 5 * 101. So, modulus 2020 is composite, and since 2^2, 5, and 101 are pairwise coprime, maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to solve this congruence. That is, solve the congruence modulo each prime power factor separately and then combine the solutions.

So, if I can find x such that:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 101,

then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there will be a unique solution mod 2020, which is the product of 4, 5, and 101. So, solving each of these congruences separately and then combining them should give me the answer. Let me handle each modulus one by one.

Starting with mod 4:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4.

But modulo 4, the possible residues are 0, 1, 2, 3. Let&#x27;s see what their powers are.

However, 3 mod 4 is -1. So maybe x is congruent to -1 mod 4? Let&#x27;s check.

If x ≡ -1 mod 4, then x^677 ≡ (-1)^677 ≡ -1 ≡ 3 mod 4. That works. So x ≡ 3 mod 4. So that&#x27;s the solution modulo 4.

Wait, but are there other possibilities? Let&#x27;s check.

Suppose x ≡ 1 mod 4. Then x^677 ≡ 1 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 0 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 2 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4 (since 2^2 is 0 mod 4, and higher exponents are still 0). So 2 mod 4 raised to any power higher than 1 is 0 mod 4. So 2 is out. Similarly, 3 mod 4 raised to any odd power is 3 mod 4. So yes, only x ≡ 3 mod 4 works. So the solution for modulus 4 is 3 mod 4.

Next, modulo 5.

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5.

We can use Fermat&#x27;s little theorem here. Since 5 is prime, for any x not divisible by 5, x^(4) ≡ 1 mod 5. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 4.

677 divided by 4: 4*169=676, so 677=4*169 +1. So 677 ≡1 mod 4.

Therefore, x^677 ≡ x^1 ≡ x mod 5. Therefore, the equation simplifies to x ≡3 mod5. So the solution modulo 5 is x ≡3 mod5.

Now, modulus 101.

This seems trickier because 101 is a larger prime. Let&#x27;s see. We need to solve x^677 ≡3 mod101.

Again, using Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, since 101 is prime, x^100 ≡1 mod101 for x not divisible by 101. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 100. Let&#x27;s compute 677 divided by 100. 100*6=600, 677-600=77. So 677 ≡77 mod100. Therefore, x^677 ≡x^77 mod101. So the equation becomes x^77 ≡3 mod101.

So now we need to solve x^77 ≡3 mod101. Hmm. To solve for x, we might need to find the 77th root of 3 modulo 101. Since 101 is prime, perhaps we can find an integer k such that (x^k)^m ≡x mod101, where m is some exponent. Alternatively, maybe we can find an inverse of 77 modulo 100, since the multiplicative order is 100.

If we can find an integer d such that 77*d ≡1 mod100, then raising both sides of the congruence x^77 ≡3 mod101 to the dth power would give x ≡3^d mod101.

So let&#x27;s find d, the inverse of 77 modulo100.

To find d such that 77d ≡1 mod100.

We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Compute gcd(77,100):

100 =1*77 +23

77=3*23 +8

23=2*8 +7

8=1*7 +1

7=7*1 +0

So gcd is 1. Now backtracking:

1=8 -1*7

But 7=23 -2*8, so substitute:

1=8 -1*(23 -2*8)=3*8 -1*23

But 8=77 -3*23, so substitute:

1=3*(77 -3*23) -1*23=3*77 -10*23

But 23=100 -1*77, substitute:

1=3*77 -10*(100 -1*77)=13*77 -10*100

Therefore, 13*77 ≡1 mod100. So d=13. Therefore, the inverse of 77 mod100 is13.

Therefore, x ≡3^13 mod101. So compute 3^13 mod101.

Let me compute 3^13 step by step:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^4=(3^2)^2=81

3^8=(3^4)^2=81^2. Let&#x27;s compute 81^2 mod101.

81^2 = 6561. 6561 divided by 101: 101*64=6464, 6561-6464=97. So 3^8 ≡97 mod101.

3^13 =3^8 *3^4 *3^1 =97*81*3 mod101.

First compute 97*81 mod101.

Compute 97*81: 97*80=7760, plus 97=7857. Now divide 7857 by101:

101*77=7777, 7857-7777=80. So 97*81 ≡80 mod101.

Then multiply by 3: 80*3=240. 240 mod101: 101*2=202, 240-202=38. So 3^13 ≡38 mod101.

Therefore, x ≡38 mod101.

Wait, let me verify that 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But that might take a while. Alternatively, let&#x27;s check if 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But since we know that 38≡3^13 mod101, then 38^77 ≡(3^13)^77=3^(13*77). But 13*77=1001, which is 10*100 +1. Therefore, 3^(1001)≡(3^100)^10 *3^1 ≡1^10 *3 ≡3 mod101. So yes, that works. Therefore, 38^77 ≡3 mod101. So x≡38 mod101 is correct.

So putting it all together, we have:

x ≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5,

x≡38 mod101.

Now, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer x that satisfies all three congruences. Let&#x27;s use the Chinese Remainder Theorem step by step.

First, let&#x27;s combine the congruences modulo 4 and 5.

Find x such that:

x≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5.

Let me write x=4k +3 for some integer k. Substitute into the second congruence:

4k +3 ≡3 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5. Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod5. Since 4*4=16≡1 mod5, inverse of 4 is4. Therefore, k≡0*4≡0 mod5. So k=5m for some integer m. Therefore, x=4*(5m) +3=20m +3.

Thus, the solution to the first two congruences is x≡3 mod20.

Now, combine this with x≡38 mod101.

So now, we need to solve:

x≡3 mod20,

x≡38 mod101.

Let me express x as x=20n +3 for some integer n. Substitute into the second congruence:

20n +3 ≡38 mod101 =&gt; 20n ≡35 mod101. So 20n ≡35 mod101.

We need to solve for n: 20n ≡35 mod101. Let&#x27;s find the inverse of 20 mod101.

Use the extended Euclidean algorithm again.

Find integers a and b such that 20a +101b=1.

101=5*20 +1

20=20*1 +0

So backtracking:

1=101 -5*20

Therefore, inverse of 20 mod101 is -5. But -5 mod101 is 96. So inverse is96.

Therefore, n≡35*96 mod101.

Compute 35*96:

35*96=35*(100 -4)=3500 -140=3360.

Now, 3360 divided by101:

101*33=3333, 3360 -3333=27. So 3360≡27 mod101. Therefore, n≡27 mod101.

Therefore, n=101m +27 for some integer m. Then x=20*(101m +27) +3=2020m +540 +3=2020m +543.

Therefore, the smallest non-negative solution is x=543 mod2020. Since 543 is less than 2020, the answer is543.

Wait, but let me check if 543^677 ≡3 mod2020. To verify, we can check modulo4,5,101.

First, modulo4: 543 mod4=543-4*135=543-540=3 mod4. Then 3^677≡3 mod4. Correct.

Modulo5:543 mod5=543-5*108=543-540=3 mod5. Then 3^677≡3 mod5 as earlier. Correct.

Modulo101:543 divided by101:101*5=505, 543-505=38. So 543≡38 mod101. Then 38^677 mod101. But as earlier, 38≡3^13 mod101, so 38^677=3^(13*677). Compute 13*677=8801. Now, since x^100≡1 mod101, reduce 8801 mod100. 8801 divided by100 is88 with remainder1. So 8801≡1 mod100. Therefore, 3^(8801)≡3^1≡3 mod101. So yes, 38^677≡3 mod101. Therefore, all congruences are satisfied.

Therefore, the answer is543.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{543}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \), we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) by solving the congruence modulo the prime power factors of 2020, which are \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 101 \).

1. **Modulo 4**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{4}
   \]
   Since \( 3 \equiv -1 \pmod{4} \) and any odd power of \(-1\) is \(-1\), we get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).

2. **Modulo 5**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{5}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 4 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \).

3. **Modulo 101**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{101}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^{100} \equiv 1 \pmod{101} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 100 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 77 \pmod{100} \). We need to solve \( x^{77} \equiv 3 \pmod{101} \). Finding the inverse of 77 modulo 100 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we get \( d = 13 \). Thus, \( x \equiv 3^{13} \pmod{101} \). Calculating \( 3^{13} \mod 101 \) gives \( 38 \), so \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \).

Combining these results using CRT:
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \) and \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) to get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \).
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \) with \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \). Solving \( 20n + 3 \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \) gives \( n \equiv 27 \pmod{101} \). Thus, \( x = 20 \cdot 27 + 3 = 543 \).

The smallest non-negative integer \( x \) that satisfies \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \) is \(\boxed{543}\).          </p>

Response: Let&#x27;s take the modulus 2020 for the given expression. We re-write this as: \begin{gather*} x^677 \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \Rightarrow x^677 = 3.528 + 30 = 3(576 + 3) + 3 \qquad (0 \leq 3 &lt; 2020). \end{gather*} So the new problem is $x^{677} = 3$.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find an integer x such that x raised to the 677th power is congruent to 3 modulo 2020. Hmm, that&#x27;s a pretty high exponent. Let me start by recalling some number theory concepts that might help here.

First, 2020 factors into prime components. Let me factorize 2020. 2020 divided by 2 is 1010, divided by 2 again is 505. Then 505 divided by 5 is 101, and 101 is a prime number. So, the prime factorization of 2020 is 2^2 * 5 * 101. So, modulus 2020 is composite, and since 2^2, 5, and 101 are pairwise coprime, maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to solve this congruence. That is, solve the congruence modulo each prime power factor separately and then combine the solutions.

So, if I can find x such that:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 101,

then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there will be a unique solution mod 2020, which is the product of 4, 5, and 101. So, solving each of these congruences separately and then combining them should give me the answer. Let me handle each modulus one by one.

Starting with mod 4:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4.

But modulo 4, the possible residues are 0, 1, 2, 3. Let&#x27;s see what their powers are.

However, 3 mod 4 is -1. So maybe x is congruent to -1 mod 4? Let&#x27;s check.

If x ≡ -1 mod 4, then x^677 ≡ (-1)^677 ≡ -1 ≡ 3 mod 4. That works. So x ≡ 3 mod 4. So that&#x27;s the solution modulo 4.

Wait, but are there other possibilities? Let&#x27;s check.

Suppose x ≡ 1 mod 4. Then x^677 ≡ 1 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 0 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 2 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4 (since 2^2 is 0 mod 4, and higher exponents are still 0). So 2 mod 4 raised to any power higher than 1 is 0 mod 4. So 2 is out. Similarly, 3 mod 4 raised to any odd power is 3 mod 4. So yes, only x ≡ 3 mod 4 works. So the solution for modulus 4 is 3 mod 4.

Next, modulo 5.

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5.

We can use Fermat&#x27;s little theorem here. Since 5 is prime, for any x not divisible by 5, x^(4) ≡ 1 mod 5. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 4.

677 divided by 4: 4*169=676, so 677=4*169 +1. So 677 ≡1 mod 4.

Therefore, x^677 ≡ x^1 ≡ x mod 5. Therefore, the equation simplifies to x ≡3 mod5. So the solution modulo 5 is x ≡3 mod5.

Now, modulus 101.

This seems trickier because 101 is a larger prime. Let&#x27;s see. We need to solve x^677 ≡3 mod101.

Again, using Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, since 101 is prime, x^100 ≡1 mod101 for x not divisible by 101. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 100. Let&#x27;s compute 677 divided by 100. 100*6=600, 677-600=77. So 677 ≡77 mod100. Therefore, x^677 ≡x^77 mod101. So the equation becomes x^77 ≡3 mod101.

So now we need to solve x^77 ≡3 mod101. Hmm. To solve for x, we might need to find the 77th root of 3 modulo 101. Since 101 is prime, perhaps we can find an integer k such that (x^k)^m ≡x mod101, where m is some exponent. Alternatively, maybe we can find an inverse of 77 modulo 100, since the multiplicative order is 100.

If we can find an integer d such that 77*d ≡1 mod100, then raising both sides of the congruence x^77 ≡3 mod101 to the dth power would give x ≡3^d mod101.

So let&#x27;s find d, the inverse of 77 modulo100.

To find d such that 77d ≡1 mod100.

We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Compute gcd(77,100):

100 =1*77 +23

77=3*23 +8

23=2*8 +7

8=1*7 +1

7=7*1 +0

So gcd is 1. Now backtracking:

1=8 -1*7

But 7=23 -2*8, so substitute:

1=8 -1*(23 -2*8)=3*8 -1*23

But 8=77 -3*23, so substitute:

1=3*(77 -3*23) -1*23=3*77 -10*23

But 23=100 -1*77, substitute:

1=3*77 -10*(100 -1*77)=13*77 -10*100

Therefore, 13*77 ≡1 mod100. So d=13. Therefore, the inverse of 77 mod100 is13.

Therefore, x ≡3^13 mod101. So compute 3^13 mod101.

Let me compute 3^13 step by step:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^4=(3^2)^2=81

3^8=(3^4)^2=81^2. Let&#x27;s compute 81^2 mod101.

81^2 = 6561. 6561 divided by 101: 101*64=6464, 6561-6464=97. So 3^8 ≡97 mod101.

3^13 =3^8 *3^4 *3^1 =97*81*3 mod101.

First compute 97*81 mod101.

Compute 97*81: 97*80=7760, plus 97=7857. Now divide 7857 by101:

101*77=7777, 7857-7777=80. So 97*81 ≡80 mod101.

Then multiply by 3: 80*3=240. 240 mod101: 101*2=202, 240-202=38. So 3^13 ≡38 mod101.

Therefore, x ≡38 mod101.

Wait, let me verify that 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But that might take a while. Alternatively, let&#x27;s check if 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But since we know that 38≡3^13 mod101, then 38^77 ≡(3^13)^77=3^(13*77). But 13*77=1001, which is 10*100 +1. Therefore, 3^(1001)≡(3^100)^10 *3^1 ≡1^10 *3 ≡3 mod101. So yes, that works. Therefore, 38^77 ≡3 mod101. So x≡38 mod101 is correct.

So putting it all together, we have:

x ≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5,

x≡38 mod101.

Now, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer x that satisfies all three congruences. Let&#x27;s use the Chinese Remainder Theorem step by step.

First, let&#x27;s combine the congruences modulo 4 and 5.

Find x such that:

x≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5.

Let me write x=4k +3 for some integer k. Substitute into the second congruence:

4k +3 ≡3 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5. Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod5. Since 4*4=16≡1 mod5, inverse of 4 is4. Therefore, k≡0*4≡0 mod5. So k=5m for some integer m. Therefore, x=4*(5m) +3=20m +3.

Thus, the solution to the first two congruences is x≡3 mod20.

Now, combine this with x≡38 mod101.

So now, we need to solve:

x≡3 mod20,

x≡38 mod101.

Let me express x as x=20n +3 for some integer n. Substitute into the second congruence:

20n +3 ≡38 mod101 =&gt; 20n ≡35 mod101. So 20n ≡35 mod101.

We need to solve for n: 20n ≡35 mod101. Let&#x27;s find the inverse of 20 mod101.

Use the extended Euclidean algorithm again.

Find integers a and b such that 20a +101b=1.

101=5*20 +1

20=20*1 +0

So backtracking:

1=101 -5*20

Therefore, inverse of 20 mod101 is -5. But -5 mod101 is 96. So inverse is96.

Therefore, n≡35*96 mod101.

Compute 35*96:

35*96=35*(100 -4)=3500 -140=3360.

Now, 3360 divided by101:

101*33=3333, 3360 -3333=27. So 3360≡27 mod101. Therefore, n≡27 mod101.

Therefore, n=101m +27 for some integer m. Then x=20*(101m +27) +3=2020m +540 +3=2020m +543.

Therefore, the smallest non-negative solution is x=543 mod2020. Since 543 is less than 2020, the answer is543.

Wait, but let me check if 543^677 ≡3 mod2020. To verify, we can check modulo4,5,101.

First, modulo4: 543 mod4=543-4*135=543-540=3 mod4. Then 3^677≡3 mod4. Correct.

Modulo5:543 mod5=543-5*108=543-540=3 mod5. Then 3^677≡3 mod5 as earlier. Correct.

Modulo101:543 divided by101:101*5=505, 543-505=38. So 543≡38 mod101. Then 38^677 mod101. But as earlier, 38≡3^13 mod101, so 38^677=3^(13*677). Compute 13*677=8801. Now, since x^100≡1 mod101, reduce 8801 mod100. 8801 divided by100 is88 with remainder1. So 8801≡1 mod100. Therefore, 3^(8801)≡3^1≡3 mod101. So yes, 38^677≡3 mod101. Therefore, all congruences are satisfied.

Therefore, the answer is543.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{543}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \), we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) by solving the congruence modulo the prime power factors of 2020, which are \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 101 \).

1. **Modulo 4**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{4}
   \]
   Since \( 3 \equiv -1 \pmod{4} \) and any odd power of \(-1\) is \(-1\), we get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).

2. **Modulo 5**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{5}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 4 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \).

3. **Modulo 101**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{101}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^{100} \equiv 1 \pmod{101} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 100 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 77 \pmod{100} \). We need to solve \( x^{77} \equiv 3 \pmod{101} \). Finding the inverse of 77 modulo 100 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we get \( d = 13 \). Thus, \( x \equiv 3^{13} \pmod{101} \). Calculating \( 3^{13} \mod 101 \) gives \( 38 \), so \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \).

Combining these results using CRT:
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \) and \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) to get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \).
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \) with \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \). Solving \( 20n + 3 \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \) gives \( n \equiv 27 \pmod{101} \). Thus, \( x = 20 \cdot 27 + 3 = 543 \).

The smallest non-negative integer \( x \) that satisfies \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \) is \(\boxed{543}\).          </p>

Problem: Find an integer $x$ such that $x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020}$. Provide your answer as the smallest non-negative integer that satisfies this congruence. Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: $x^{677}$ is congruent to $3$ modulo $2020$. When we divide $2020$ into $677$, we get $202...202$. Multiples of $202$ are congruent to $0$, so each factor in this reminder sequence is congruent to $0$ when divided by $2020$. Thus when we raise $202...202$ to the $677$ power, we get the same thing for $2020$, and $3^0$ has a remainder of $3$ when divided by $2020$, so that is the answer we want. Therefore, we just care about the units digit, and since $2020 \equiv 0$ modulo $10$, we want $3$ to be the units digit when raised to some power.  $3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27 \equiv 7 \pmod{10}$. Thus, we just care about the tens digit of $7$ in $2020$, which is $2$.  Since there are no tens digits, just the $2$ repeats to get $202...202 \equiv 722_2 \equiv 7_2$ and thus $x \equiv 2 \pmod{10}$ is our answer.  Next, let&#x27;s reduce $x^{677}$ using these properties: $x = \frac{a}{x} \times 10 + y$ where $y &lt; 10$ and $10$ must be a factor of the numerator of $x$. If $1 &lt; x &lt; 10$, then both $x$ and $a = 10x$ don&#x27;t fit into $2020$, but 10 does. Since we are calculating modulo $2020$, we could instead say that $a = 10x \times 2020$, and $x$ is congruent to $0$. $x^{677}$ will have a units digit of $y^{677} \equiv y^{677} \pmod{10} \equiv y \equiv 2 \pmod{10} (y = 2, 2).$(Remember, we are just calculating modulo divisors of $2020$ that have large powers of ten.) $x^{677} \equiv 0 \equiv 2 \pmod{2020} (x = 0 = 2020)$, with $0 \equiv 2$ modulo $2020$. \boxed{2020} And thus this congruence is true for this value of $x$.&lt;|end_of_text|&gt;          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find an integer x such that x raised to the 677th power is congruent to 3 modulo 2020. Hmm, that&#x27;s a pretty high exponent. Let me start by recalling some number theory concepts that might help here.

First, 2020 factors into prime components. Let me factorize 2020. 2020 divided by 2 is 1010, divided by 2 again is 505. Then 505 divided by 5 is 101, and 101 is a prime number. So, the prime factorization of 2020 is 2^2 * 5 * 101. So, modulus 2020 is composite, and since 2^2, 5, and 101 are pairwise coprime, maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to solve this congruence. That is, solve the congruence modulo each prime power factor separately and then combine the solutions.

So, if I can find x such that:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 101,

then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there will be a unique solution mod 2020, which is the product of 4, 5, and 101. So, solving each of these congruences separately and then combining them should give me the answer. Let me handle each modulus one by one.

Starting with mod 4:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4.

But modulo 4, the possible residues are 0, 1, 2, 3. Let&#x27;s see what their powers are.

However, 3 mod 4 is -1. So maybe x is congruent to -1 mod 4? Let&#x27;s check.

If x ≡ -1 mod 4, then x^677 ≡ (-1)^677 ≡ -1 ≡ 3 mod 4. That works. So x ≡ 3 mod 4. So that&#x27;s the solution modulo 4.

Wait, but are there other possibilities? Let&#x27;s check.

Suppose x ≡ 1 mod 4. Then x^677 ≡ 1 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 0 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 2 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4 (since 2^2 is 0 mod 4, and higher exponents are still 0). So 2 mod 4 raised to any power higher than 1 is 0 mod 4. So 2 is out. Similarly, 3 mod 4 raised to any odd power is 3 mod 4. So yes, only x ≡ 3 mod 4 works. So the solution for modulus 4 is 3 mod 4.

Next, modulo 5.

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5.

We can use Fermat&#x27;s little theorem here. Since 5 is prime, for any x not divisible by 5, x^(4) ≡ 1 mod 5. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 4.

677 divided by 4: 4*169=676, so 677=4*169 +1. So 677 ≡1 mod 4.

Therefore, x^677 ≡ x^1 ≡ x mod 5. Therefore, the equation simplifies to x ≡3 mod5. So the solution modulo 5 is x ≡3 mod5.

Now, modulus 101.

This seems trickier because 101 is a larger prime. Let&#x27;s see. We need to solve x^677 ≡3 mod101.

Again, using Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, since 101 is prime, x^100 ≡1 mod101 for x not divisible by 101. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 100. Let&#x27;s compute 677 divided by 100. 100*6=600, 677-600=77. So 677 ≡77 mod100. Therefore, x^677 ≡x^77 mod101. So the equation becomes x^77 ≡3 mod101.

So now we need to solve x^77 ≡3 mod101. Hmm. To solve for x, we might need to find the 77th root of 3 modulo 101. Since 101 is prime, perhaps we can find an integer k such that (x^k)^m ≡x mod101, where m is some exponent. Alternatively, maybe we can find an inverse of 77 modulo 100, since the multiplicative order is 100.

If we can find an integer d such that 77*d ≡1 mod100, then raising both sides of the congruence x^77 ≡3 mod101 to the dth power would give x ≡3^d mod101.

So let&#x27;s find d, the inverse of 77 modulo100.

To find d such that 77d ≡1 mod100.

We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Compute gcd(77,100):

100 =1*77 +23

77=3*23 +8

23=2*8 +7

8=1*7 +1

7=7*1 +0

So gcd is 1. Now backtracking:

1=8 -1*7

But 7=23 -2*8, so substitute:

1=8 -1*(23 -2*8)=3*8 -1*23

But 8=77 -3*23, so substitute:

1=3*(77 -3*23) -1*23=3*77 -10*23

But 23=100 -1*77, substitute:

1=3*77 -10*(100 -1*77)=13*77 -10*100

Therefore, 13*77 ≡1 mod100. So d=13. Therefore, the inverse of 77 mod100 is13.

Therefore, x ≡3^13 mod101. So compute 3^13 mod101.

Let me compute 3^13 step by step:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^4=(3^2)^2=81

3^8=(3^4)^2=81^2. Let&#x27;s compute 81^2 mod101.

81^2 = 6561. 6561 divided by 101: 101*64=6464, 6561-6464=97. So 3^8 ≡97 mod101.

3^13 =3^8 *3^4 *3^1 =97*81*3 mod101.

First compute 97*81 mod101.

Compute 97*81: 97*80=7760, plus 97=7857. Now divide 7857 by101:

101*77=7777, 7857-7777=80. So 97*81 ≡80 mod101.

Then multiply by 3: 80*3=240. 240 mod101: 101*2=202, 240-202=38. So 3^13 ≡38 mod101.

Therefore, x ≡38 mod101.

Wait, let me verify that 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But that might take a while. Alternatively, let&#x27;s check if 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But since we know that 38≡3^13 mod101, then 38^77 ≡(3^13)^77=3^(13*77). But 13*77=1001, which is 10*100 +1. Therefore, 3^(1001)≡(3^100)^10 *3^1 ≡1^10 *3 ≡3 mod101. So yes, that works. Therefore, 38^77 ≡3 mod101. So x≡38 mod101 is correct.

So putting it all together, we have:

x ≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5,

x≡38 mod101.

Now, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer x that satisfies all three congruences. Let&#x27;s use the Chinese Remainder Theorem step by step.

First, let&#x27;s combine the congruences modulo 4 and 5.

Find x such that:

x≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5.

Let me write x=4k +3 for some integer k. Substitute into the second congruence:

4k +3 ≡3 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5. Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod5. Since 4*4=16≡1 mod5, inverse of 4 is4. Therefore, k≡0*4≡0 mod5. So k=5m for some integer m. Therefore, x=4*(5m) +3=20m +3.

Thus, the solution to the first two congruences is x≡3 mod20.

Now, combine this with x≡38 mod101.

So now, we need to solve:

x≡3 mod20,

x≡38 mod101.

Let me express x as x=20n +3 for some integer n. Substitute into the second congruence:

20n +3 ≡38 mod101 =&gt; 20n ≡35 mod101. So 20n ≡35 mod101.

We need to solve for n: 20n ≡35 mod101. Let&#x27;s find the inverse of 20 mod101.

Use the extended Euclidean algorithm again.

Find integers a and b such that 20a +101b=1.

101=5*20 +1

20=20*1 +0

So backtracking:

1=101 -5*20

Therefore, inverse of 20 mod101 is -5. But -5 mod101 is 96. So inverse is96.

Therefore, n≡35*96 mod101.

Compute 35*96:

35*96=35*(100 -4)=3500 -140=3360.

Now, 3360 divided by101:

101*33=3333, 3360 -3333=27. So 3360≡27 mod101. Therefore, n≡27 mod101.

Therefore, n=101m +27 for some integer m. Then x=20*(101m +27) +3=2020m +540 +3=2020m +543.

Therefore, the smallest non-negative solution is x=543 mod2020. Since 543 is less than 2020, the answer is543.

Wait, but let me check if 543^677 ≡3 mod2020. To verify, we can check modulo4,5,101.

First, modulo4: 543 mod4=543-4*135=543-540=3 mod4. Then 3^677≡3 mod4. Correct.

Modulo5:543 mod5=543-5*108=543-540=3 mod5. Then 3^677≡3 mod5 as earlier. Correct.

Modulo101:543 divided by101:101*5=505, 543-505=38. So 543≡38 mod101. Then 38^677 mod101. But as earlier, 38≡3^13 mod101, so 38^677=3^(13*677). Compute 13*677=8801. Now, since x^100≡1 mod101, reduce 8801 mod100. 8801 divided by100 is88 with remainder1. So 8801≡1 mod100. Therefore, 3^(8801)≡3^1≡3 mod101. So yes, 38^677≡3 mod101. Therefore, all congruences are satisfied.

Therefore, the answer is543.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{543}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \), we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) by solving the congruence modulo the prime power factors of 2020, which are \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 101 \).

1. **Modulo 4**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{4}
   \]
   Since \( 3 \equiv -1 \pmod{4} \) and any odd power of \(-1\) is \(-1\), we get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).

2. **Modulo 5**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{5}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 4 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \).

3. **Modulo 101**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{101}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^{100} \equiv 1 \pmod{101} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 100 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 77 \pmod{100} \). We need to solve \( x^{77} \equiv 3 \pmod{101} \). Finding the inverse of 77 modulo 100 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we get \( d = 13 \). Thus, \( x \equiv 3^{13} \pmod{101} \). Calculating \( 3^{13} \mod 101 \) gives \( 38 \), so \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \).

Combining these results using CRT:
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \) and \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) to get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \).
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \) with \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \). Solving \( 20n + 3 \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \) gives \( n \equiv 27 \pmod{101} \). Thus, \( x = 20 \cdot 27 + 3 = 543 \).

The smallest non-negative integer \( x \) that satisfies \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \) is \(\boxed{543}\).          </p>

Problem: Find an integer $x$ such that $x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020}$. Provide your answer as the smallest non-negative integer that satisfies this congruence. Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Well, we know that when we multiply integers modulo $2020$, the result is what we get when we multiply the whole numbers and convert the final result to the same (or smaller) modulo. 22 × 20 = 440 = 380 (mod 2020), so 20 × 20 (where you just repeat the 2020 factorial) is also 380 = 380 (mod 2020).

Now let&#x27;s try $x = 2^{20} + 1$. Note that $2^{20} + 1 = 1^{20} + 1 = 2^{20} - 2 &gt; 0$ because we can rewrite it as $1^2 - 1^2 + 2 \ge 0$. Thus, $2^{20} + 1 = 2(x - 1) + 1 = 1 \pmod{2020}$, so $x^2 - 21x + 400 = 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{2020}$.

Let&#x27;s try $x = 8g - 12g - 2$. As you can see, we may not have to solve this for $g$. (The congruence is 1 ≡ 3 (mod 9), so we couldshortcut the process by picking the answer $x = 82 - 12g - 2$ and then shrinking it modulo 9 to get the solution as the smallest nonnegative answer to $82 - 12g - 2 \equiv 3 (mod 2020)$.)&lt;|end_of_text|&gt;          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find an integer x such that x raised to the 677th power is congruent to 3 modulo 2020. Hmm, that&#x27;s a pretty high exponent. Let me start by recalling some number theory concepts that might help here.

First, 2020 factors into prime components. Let me factorize 2020. 2020 divided by 2 is 1010, divided by 2 again is 505. Then 505 divided by 5 is 101, and 101 is a prime number. So, the prime factorization of 2020 is 2^2 * 5 * 101. So, modulus 2020 is composite, and since 2^2, 5, and 101 are pairwise coprime, maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to solve this congruence. That is, solve the congruence modulo each prime power factor separately and then combine the solutions.

So, if I can find x such that:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 101,

then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there will be a unique solution mod 2020, which is the product of 4, 5, and 101. So, solving each of these congruences separately and then combining them should give me the answer. Let me handle each modulus one by one.

Starting with mod 4:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4.

But modulo 4, the possible residues are 0, 1, 2, 3. Let&#x27;s see what their powers are.

However, 3 mod 4 is -1. So maybe x is congruent to -1 mod 4? Let&#x27;s check.

If x ≡ -1 mod 4, then x^677 ≡ (-1)^677 ≡ -1 ≡ 3 mod 4. That works. So x ≡ 3 mod 4. So that&#x27;s the solution modulo 4.

Wait, but are there other possibilities? Let&#x27;s check.

Suppose x ≡ 1 mod 4. Then x^677 ≡ 1 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 0 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 2 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4 (since 2^2 is 0 mod 4, and higher exponents are still 0). So 2 mod 4 raised to any power higher than 1 is 0 mod 4. So 2 is out. Similarly, 3 mod 4 raised to any odd power is 3 mod 4. So yes, only x ≡ 3 mod 4 works. So the solution for modulus 4 is 3 mod 4.

Next, modulo 5.

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5.

We can use Fermat&#x27;s little theorem here. Since 5 is prime, for any x not divisible by 5, x^(4) ≡ 1 mod 5. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 4.

677 divided by 4: 4*169=676, so 677=4*169 +1. So 677 ≡1 mod 4.

Therefore, x^677 ≡ x^1 ≡ x mod 5. Therefore, the equation simplifies to x ≡3 mod5. So the solution modulo 5 is x ≡3 mod5.

Now, modulus 101.

This seems trickier because 101 is a larger prime. Let&#x27;s see. We need to solve x^677 ≡3 mod101.

Again, using Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, since 101 is prime, x^100 ≡1 mod101 for x not divisible by 101. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 100. Let&#x27;s compute 677 divided by 100. 100*6=600, 677-600=77. So 677 ≡77 mod100. Therefore, x^677 ≡x^77 mod101. So the equation becomes x^77 ≡3 mod101.

So now we need to solve x^77 ≡3 mod101. Hmm. To solve for x, we might need to find the 77th root of 3 modulo 101. Since 101 is prime, perhaps we can find an integer k such that (x^k)^m ≡x mod101, where m is some exponent. Alternatively, maybe we can find an inverse of 77 modulo 100, since the multiplicative order is 100.

If we can find an integer d such that 77*d ≡1 mod100, then raising both sides of the congruence x^77 ≡3 mod101 to the dth power would give x ≡3^d mod101.

So let&#x27;s find d, the inverse of 77 modulo100.

To find d such that 77d ≡1 mod100.

We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Compute gcd(77,100):

100 =1*77 +23

77=3*23 +8

23=2*8 +7

8=1*7 +1

7=7*1 +0

So gcd is 1. Now backtracking:

1=8 -1*7

But 7=23 -2*8, so substitute:

1=8 -1*(23 -2*8)=3*8 -1*23

But 8=77 -3*23, so substitute:

1=3*(77 -3*23) -1*23=3*77 -10*23

But 23=100 -1*77, substitute:

1=3*77 -10*(100 -1*77)=13*77 -10*100

Therefore, 13*77 ≡1 mod100. So d=13. Therefore, the inverse of 77 mod100 is13.

Therefore, x ≡3^13 mod101. So compute 3^13 mod101.

Let me compute 3^13 step by step:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^4=(3^2)^2=81

3^8=(3^4)^2=81^2. Let&#x27;s compute 81^2 mod101.

81^2 = 6561. 6561 divided by 101: 101*64=6464, 6561-6464=97. So 3^8 ≡97 mod101.

3^13 =3^8 *3^4 *3^1 =97*81*3 mod101.

First compute 97*81 mod101.

Compute 97*81: 97*80=7760, plus 97=7857. Now divide 7857 by101:

101*77=7777, 7857-7777=80. So 97*81 ≡80 mod101.

Then multiply by 3: 80*3=240. 240 mod101: 101*2=202, 240-202=38. So 3^13 ≡38 mod101.

Therefore, x ≡38 mod101.

Wait, let me verify that 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But that might take a while. Alternatively, let&#x27;s check if 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But since we know that 38≡3^13 mod101, then 38^77 ≡(3^13)^77=3^(13*77). But 13*77=1001, which is 10*100 +1. Therefore, 3^(1001)≡(3^100)^10 *3^1 ≡1^10 *3 ≡3 mod101. So yes, that works. Therefore, 38^77 ≡3 mod101. So x≡38 mod101 is correct.

So putting it all together, we have:

x ≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5,

x≡38 mod101.

Now, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer x that satisfies all three congruences. Let&#x27;s use the Chinese Remainder Theorem step by step.

First, let&#x27;s combine the congruences modulo 4 and 5.

Find x such that:

x≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5.

Let me write x=4k +3 for some integer k. Substitute into the second congruence:

4k +3 ≡3 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5. Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod5. Since 4*4=16≡1 mod5, inverse of 4 is4. Therefore, k≡0*4≡0 mod5. So k=5m for some integer m. Therefore, x=4*(5m) +3=20m +3.

Thus, the solution to the first two congruences is x≡3 mod20.

Now, combine this with x≡38 mod101.

So now, we need to solve:

x≡3 mod20,

x≡38 mod101.

Let me express x as x=20n +3 for some integer n. Substitute into the second congruence:

20n +3 ≡38 mod101 =&gt; 20n ≡35 mod101. So 20n ≡35 mod101.

We need to solve for n: 20n ≡35 mod101. Let&#x27;s find the inverse of 20 mod101.

Use the extended Euclidean algorithm again.

Find integers a and b such that 20a +101b=1.

101=5*20 +1

20=20*1 +0

So backtracking:

1=101 -5*20

Therefore, inverse of 20 mod101 is -5. But -5 mod101 is 96. So inverse is96.

Therefore, n≡35*96 mod101.

Compute 35*96:

35*96=35*(100 -4)=3500 -140=3360.

Now, 3360 divided by101:

101*33=3333, 3360 -3333=27. So 3360≡27 mod101. Therefore, n≡27 mod101.

Therefore, n=101m +27 for some integer m. Then x=20*(101m +27) +3=2020m +540 +3=2020m +543.

Therefore, the smallest non-negative solution is x=543 mod2020. Since 543 is less than 2020, the answer is543.

Wait, but let me check if 543^677 ≡3 mod2020. To verify, we can check modulo4,5,101.

First, modulo4: 543 mod4=543-4*135=543-540=3 mod4. Then 3^677≡3 mod4. Correct.

Modulo5:543 mod5=543-5*108=543-540=3 mod5. Then 3^677≡3 mod5 as earlier. Correct.

Modulo101:543 divided by101:101*5=505, 543-505=38. So 543≡38 mod101. Then 38^677 mod101. But as earlier, 38≡3^13 mod101, so 38^677=3^(13*677). Compute 13*677=8801. Now, since x^100≡1 mod101, reduce 8801 mod100. 8801 divided by100 is88 with remainder1. So 8801≡1 mod100. Therefore, 3^(8801)≡3^1≡3 mod101. So yes, 38^677≡3 mod101. Therefore, all congruences are satisfied.

Therefore, the answer is543.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{543}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \), we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) by solving the congruence modulo the prime power factors of 2020, which are \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 101 \).

1. **Modulo 4**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{4}
   \]
   Since \( 3 \equiv -1 \pmod{4} \) and any odd power of \(-1\) is \(-1\), we get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).

2. **Modulo 5**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{5}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 4 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \).

3. **Modulo 101**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{101}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^{100} \equiv 1 \pmod{101} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 100 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 77 \pmod{100} \). We need to solve \( x^{77} \equiv 3 \pmod{101} \). Finding the inverse of 77 modulo 100 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we get \( d = 13 \). Thus, \( x \equiv 3^{13} \pmod{101} \). Calculating \( 3^{13} \mod 101 \) gives \( 38 \), so \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \).

Combining these results using CRT:
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \) and \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) to get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \).
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \) with \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \). Solving \( 20n + 3 \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \) gives \( n \equiv 27 \pmod{101} \). Thus, \( x = 20 \cdot 27 + 3 = 543 \).

The smallest non-negative integer \( x \) that satisfies \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \) is \(\boxed{543}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find an integer x such that x raised to the 677th power is congruent to 3 modulo 2020. Hmm, that&#x27;s a pretty high exponent. Let me start by recalling some number theory concepts that might help here.

First, 2020 factors into prime components. Let me factorize 2020. 2020 divided by 2 is 1010, divided by 2 again is 505. Then 505 divided by 5 is 101, and 101 is a prime number. So, the prime factorization of 2020 is 2^2 * 5 * 101. So, modulus 2020 is composite, and since 2^2, 5, and 101 are pairwise coprime, maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to solve this congruence. That is, solve the congruence modulo each prime power factor separately and then combine the solutions.

So, if I can find x such that:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 101,

then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there will be a unique solution mod 2020, which is the product of 4, 5, and 101. So, solving each of these congruences separately and then combining them should give me the answer. Let me handle each modulus one by one.

Starting with mod 4:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4.

But modulo 4, the possible residues are 0, 1, 2, 3. Let&#x27;s see what their powers are.

However, 3 mod 4 is -1. So maybe x is congruent to -1 mod 4? Let&#x27;s check.

If x ≡ -1 mod 4, then x^677 ≡ (-1)^677 ≡ -1 ≡ 3 mod 4. That works. So x ≡ 3 mod 4. So that&#x27;s the solution modulo 4.

Wait, but are there other possibilities? Let&#x27;s check.

Suppose x ≡ 1 mod 4. Then x^677 ≡ 1 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 0 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 2 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4 (since 2^2 is 0 mod 4, and higher exponents are still 0). So 2 mod 4 raised to any power higher than 1 is 0 mod 4. So 2 is out. Similarly, 3 mod 4 raised to any odd power is 3 mod 4. So yes, only x ≡ 3 mod 4 works. So the solution for modulus 4 is 3 mod 4.

Next, modulo 5.

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5.

We can use Fermat&#x27;s little theorem here. Since 5 is prime, for any x not divisible by 5, x^(4) ≡ 1 mod 5. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 4.

677 divided by 4: 4*169=676, so 677=4*169 +1. So 677 ≡1 mod 4.

Therefore, x^677 ≡ x^1 ≡ x mod 5. Therefore, the equation simplifies to x ≡3 mod5. So the solution modulo 5 is x ≡3 mod5.

Now, modulus 101.

This seems trickier because 101 is a larger prime. Let&#x27;s see. We need to solve x^677 ≡3 mod101.

Again, using Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, since 101 is prime, x^100 ≡1 mod101 for x not divisible by 101. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 100. Let&#x27;s compute 677 divided by 100. 100*6=600, 677-600=77. So 677 ≡77 mod100. Therefore, x^677 ≡x^77 mod101. So the equation becomes x^77 ≡3 mod101.

So now we need to solve x^77 ≡3 mod101. Hmm. To solve for x, we might need to find the 77th root of 3 modulo 101. Since 101 is prime, perhaps we can find an integer k such that (x^k)^m ≡x mod101, where m is some exponent. Alternatively, maybe we can find an inverse of 77 modulo 100, since the multiplicative order is 100.

If we can find an integer d such that 77*d ≡1 mod100, then raising both sides of the congruence x^77 ≡3 mod101 to the dth power would give x ≡3^d mod101.

So let&#x27;s find d, the inverse of 77 modulo100.

To find d such that 77d ≡1 mod100.

We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Compute gcd(77,100):

100 =1*77 +23

77=3*23 +8

23=2*8 +7

8=1*7 +1

7=7*1 +0

So gcd is 1. Now backtracking:

1=8 -1*7

But 7=23 -2*8, so substitute:

1=8 -1*(23 -2*8)=3*8 -1*23

But 8=77 -3*23, so substitute:

1=3*(77 -3*23) -1*23=3*77 -10*23

But 23=100 -1*77, substitute:

1=3*77 -10*(100 -1*77)=13*77 -10*100

Therefore, 13*77 ≡1 mod100. So d=13. Therefore, the inverse of 77 mod100 is13.

Therefore, x ≡3^13 mod101. So compute 3^13 mod101.

Let me compute 3^13 step by step:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^4=(3^2)^2=81

3^8=(3^4)^2=81^2. Let&#x27;s compute 81^2 mod101.

81^2 = 6561. 6561 divided by 101: 101*64=6464, 6561-6464=97. So 3^8 ≡97 mod101.

3^13 =3^8 *3^4 *3^1 =97*81*3 mod101.

First compute 97*81 mod101.

Compute 97*81: 97*80=7760, plus 97=7857. Now divide 7857 by101:

101*77=7777, 7857-7777=80. So 97*81 ≡80 mod101.

Then multiply by 3: 80*3=240. 240 mod101: 101*2=202, 240-202=38. So 3^13 ≡38 mod101.

Therefore, x ≡38 mod101.

Wait, let me verify that 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But that might take a while. Alternatively, let&#x27;s check if 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But since we know that 38≡3^13 mod101, then 38^77 ≡(3^13)^77=3^(13*77). But 13*77=1001, which is 10*100 +1. Therefore, 3^(1001)≡(3^100)^10 *3^1 ≡1^10 *3 ≡3 mod101. So yes, that works. Therefore, 38^77 ≡3 mod101. So x≡38 mod101 is correct.

So putting it all together, we have:

x ≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5,

x≡38 mod101.

Now, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer x that satisfies all three congruences. Let&#x27;s use the Chinese Remainder Theorem step by step.

First, let&#x27;s combine the congruences modulo 4 and 5.

Find x such that:

x≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5.

Let me write x=4k +3 for some integer k. Substitute into the second congruence:

4k +3 ≡3 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5. Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod5. Since 4*4=16≡1 mod5, inverse of 4 is4. Therefore, k≡0*4≡0 mod5. So k=5m for some integer m. Therefore, x=4*(5m) +3=20m +3.

Thus, the solution to the first two congruences is x≡3 mod20.

Now, combine this with x≡38 mod101.

So now, we need to solve:

x≡3 mod20,

x≡38 mod101.

Let me express x as x=20n +3 for some integer n. Substitute into the second congruence:

20n +3 ≡38 mod101 =&gt; 20n ≡35 mod101. So 20n ≡35 mod101.

We need to solve for n: 20n ≡35 mod101. Let&#x27;s find the inverse of 20 mod101.

Use the extended Euclidean algorithm again.

Find integers a and b such that 20a +101b=1.

101=5*20 +1

20=20*1 +0

So backtracking:

1=101 -5*20

Therefore, inverse of 20 mod101 is -5. But -5 mod101 is 96. So inverse is96.

Therefore, n≡35*96 mod101.

Compute 35*96:

35*96=35*(100 -4)=3500 -140=3360.

Now, 3360 divided by101:

101*33=3333, 3360 -3333=27. So 3360≡27 mod101. Therefore, n≡27 mod101.

Therefore, n=101m +27 for some integer m. Then x=20*(101m +27) +3=2020m +540 +3=2020m +543.

Therefore, the smallest non-negative solution is x=543 mod2020. Since 543 is less than 2020, the answer is543.

Wait, but let me check if 543^677 ≡3 mod2020. To verify, we can check modulo4,5,101.

First, modulo4: 543 mod4=543-4*135=543-540=3 mod4. Then 3^677≡3 mod4. Correct.

Modulo5:543 mod5=543-5*108=543-540=3 mod5. Then 3^677≡3 mod5 as earlier. Correct.

Modulo101:543 divided by101:101*5=505, 543-505=38. So 543≡38 mod101. Then 38^677 mod101. But as earlier, 38≡3^13 mod101, so 38^677=3^(13*677). Compute 13*677=8801. Now, since x^100≡1 mod101, reduce 8801 mod100. 8801 divided by100 is88 with remainder1. So 8801≡1 mod100. Therefore, 3^(8801)≡3^1≡3 mod101. So yes, 38^677≡3 mod101. Therefore, all congruences are satisfied.

Therefore, the answer is543.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{543}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \), we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) by solving the congruence modulo the prime power factors of 2020, which are \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 101 \).

1. **Modulo 4**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{4}
   \]
   Since \( 3 \equiv -1 \pmod{4} \) and any odd power of \(-1\) is \(-1\), we get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).

2. **Modulo 5**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{5}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 4 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \).

3. **Modulo 101**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{101}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^{100} \equiv 1 \pmod{101} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 100 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 77 \pmod{100} \). We need to solve \( x^{77} \equiv 3 \pmod{101} \). Finding the inverse of 77 modulo 100 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we get \( d = 13 \). Thus, \( x \equiv 3^{13} \pmod{101} \). Calculating \( 3^{13} \mod 101 \) gives \( 38 \), so \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \).

Combining these results using CRT:
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \) and \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) to get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \).
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \) with \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \). Solving \( 20n + 3 \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \) gives \( n \equiv 27 \pmod{101} \). Thus, \( x = 20 \cdot 27 + 3 = 543 \).

The smallest non-negative integer \( x \) that satisfies \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \) is \(\boxed{543}\).          </p>

Problem: Find an integer $x$ such that $x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020}$. Provide your answer as the smallest non-negative integer that satisfies this congruence. Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: First, it&#x27;s helpful to try to evaluate $3^{677} \pmod{2020}$. First, we can observe that $2020 = 2^2 \cdot 5^3$, so $3^{677} \equiv 3^{1 \cdot 677} \equiv 3^{677}$ (mod 10).

We can prime factorize $678 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 19$.

In particular, we can break $677 = 2^1 \cdot 11 \cdot 31$, so $677 \equiv 11 \cdot 31 \pmod{2020}$.

$3^{677} \equiv ((3^{11} \cdot 3^{31})^2)^2 \equiv (3^{31})^2 \equiv 9^2 \equiv 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{2020}$.

Because $2018 = 2^2 \cdot 503$, we conclude that $1^{502} \equiv 1 \pmod{2020}$.

Thus, $1^{502} \equiv 1 \pmod{2020}$ and $1 \cdot 11 \cdot 31 \equiv 1 \cdot 677 \pmod{2020}$, so $1^{1} \cdot 1^{502} \cdot 1^{11} \cdot 1^{31} \equiv 1 \cdot 677 \pmod{2020}$.

Once again we have that $1^{1} \equiv 1 \pmod{2020}$, so $1^{502} \cdot 1^{11} \cdot 1^{31} \equiv 678 \pmod{2020}$.

From this we must choose that value of $x$ that makes $x^{677} \equiv x^3 \equiv x^{678} \equiv 678 \pmod{2020}$. $\pi \pmod{2020} = 3$, as desired.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find an integer x such that x raised to the 677th power is congruent to 3 modulo 2020. Hmm, that&#x27;s a pretty high exponent. Let me start by recalling some number theory concepts that might help here.

First, 2020 factors into prime components. Let me factorize 2020. 2020 divided by 2 is 1010, divided by 2 again is 505. Then 505 divided by 5 is 101, and 101 is a prime number. So, the prime factorization of 2020 is 2^2 * 5 * 101. So, modulus 2020 is composite, and since 2^2, 5, and 101 are pairwise coprime, maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to solve this congruence. That is, solve the congruence modulo each prime power factor separately and then combine the solutions.

So, if I can find x such that:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5,

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 101,

then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there will be a unique solution mod 2020, which is the product of 4, 5, and 101. So, solving each of these congruences separately and then combining them should give me the answer. Let me handle each modulus one by one.

Starting with mod 4:

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 4.

But modulo 4, the possible residues are 0, 1, 2, 3. Let&#x27;s see what their powers are.

However, 3 mod 4 is -1. So maybe x is congruent to -1 mod 4? Let&#x27;s check.

If x ≡ -1 mod 4, then x^677 ≡ (-1)^677 ≡ -1 ≡ 3 mod 4. That works. So x ≡ 3 mod 4. So that&#x27;s the solution modulo 4.

Wait, but are there other possibilities? Let&#x27;s check.

Suppose x ≡ 1 mod 4. Then x^677 ≡ 1 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 0 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4, which is not 3.

x ≡ 2 mod 4: x^677 ≡ 0 mod 4 (since 2^2 is 0 mod 4, and higher exponents are still 0). So 2 mod 4 raised to any power higher than 1 is 0 mod 4. So 2 is out. Similarly, 3 mod 4 raised to any odd power is 3 mod 4. So yes, only x ≡ 3 mod 4 works. So the solution for modulus 4 is 3 mod 4.

Next, modulo 5.

x^677 ≡ 3 mod 5.

We can use Fermat&#x27;s little theorem here. Since 5 is prime, for any x not divisible by 5, x^(4) ≡ 1 mod 5. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 4.

677 divided by 4: 4*169=676, so 677=4*169 +1. So 677 ≡1 mod 4.

Therefore, x^677 ≡ x^1 ≡ x mod 5. Therefore, the equation simplifies to x ≡3 mod5. So the solution modulo 5 is x ≡3 mod5.

Now, modulus 101.

This seems trickier because 101 is a larger prime. Let&#x27;s see. We need to solve x^677 ≡3 mod101.

Again, using Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, since 101 is prime, x^100 ≡1 mod101 for x not divisible by 101. So the exponent 677 can be reduced modulo 100. Let&#x27;s compute 677 divided by 100. 100*6=600, 677-600=77. So 677 ≡77 mod100. Therefore, x^677 ≡x^77 mod101. So the equation becomes x^77 ≡3 mod101.

So now we need to solve x^77 ≡3 mod101. Hmm. To solve for x, we might need to find the 77th root of 3 modulo 101. Since 101 is prime, perhaps we can find an integer k such that (x^k)^m ≡x mod101, where m is some exponent. Alternatively, maybe we can find an inverse of 77 modulo 100, since the multiplicative order is 100.

If we can find an integer d such that 77*d ≡1 mod100, then raising both sides of the congruence x^77 ≡3 mod101 to the dth power would give x ≡3^d mod101.

So let&#x27;s find d, the inverse of 77 modulo100.

To find d such that 77d ≡1 mod100.

We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Compute gcd(77,100):

100 =1*77 +23

77=3*23 +8

23=2*8 +7

8=1*7 +1

7=7*1 +0

So gcd is 1. Now backtracking:

1=8 -1*7

But 7=23 -2*8, so substitute:

1=8 -1*(23 -2*8)=3*8 -1*23

But 8=77 -3*23, so substitute:

1=3*(77 -3*23) -1*23=3*77 -10*23

But 23=100 -1*77, substitute:

1=3*77 -10*(100 -1*77)=13*77 -10*100

Therefore, 13*77 ≡1 mod100. So d=13. Therefore, the inverse of 77 mod100 is13.

Therefore, x ≡3^13 mod101. So compute 3^13 mod101.

Let me compute 3^13 step by step:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^4=(3^2)^2=81

3^8=(3^4)^2=81^2. Let&#x27;s compute 81^2 mod101.

81^2 = 6561. 6561 divided by 101: 101*64=6464, 6561-6464=97. So 3^8 ≡97 mod101.

3^13 =3^8 *3^4 *3^1 =97*81*3 mod101.

First compute 97*81 mod101.

Compute 97*81: 97*80=7760, plus 97=7857. Now divide 7857 by101:

101*77=7777, 7857-7777=80. So 97*81 ≡80 mod101.

Then multiply by 3: 80*3=240. 240 mod101: 101*2=202, 240-202=38. So 3^13 ≡38 mod101.

Therefore, x ≡38 mod101.

Wait, let me verify that 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But that might take a while. Alternatively, let&#x27;s check if 38^77 ≡3 mod101.

But since we know that 38≡3^13 mod101, then 38^77 ≡(3^13)^77=3^(13*77). But 13*77=1001, which is 10*100 +1. Therefore, 3^(1001)≡(3^100)^10 *3^1 ≡1^10 *3 ≡3 mod101. So yes, that works. Therefore, 38^77 ≡3 mod101. So x≡38 mod101 is correct.

So putting it all together, we have:

x ≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5,

x≡38 mod101.

Now, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer x that satisfies all three congruences. Let&#x27;s use the Chinese Remainder Theorem step by step.

First, let&#x27;s combine the congruences modulo 4 and 5.

Find x such that:

x≡3 mod4,

x≡3 mod5.

Let me write x=4k +3 for some integer k. Substitute into the second congruence:

4k +3 ≡3 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5 =&gt; 4k ≡0 mod5. Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod5. Since 4*4=16≡1 mod5, inverse of 4 is4. Therefore, k≡0*4≡0 mod5. So k=5m for some integer m. Therefore, x=4*(5m) +3=20m +3.

Thus, the solution to the first two congruences is x≡3 mod20.

Now, combine this with x≡38 mod101.

So now, we need to solve:

x≡3 mod20,

x≡38 mod101.

Let me express x as x=20n +3 for some integer n. Substitute into the second congruence:

20n +3 ≡38 mod101 =&gt; 20n ≡35 mod101. So 20n ≡35 mod101.

We need to solve for n: 20n ≡35 mod101. Let&#x27;s find the inverse of 20 mod101.

Use the extended Euclidean algorithm again.

Find integers a and b such that 20a +101b=1.

101=5*20 +1

20=20*1 +0

So backtracking:

1=101 -5*20

Therefore, inverse of 20 mod101 is -5. But -5 mod101 is 96. So inverse is96.

Therefore, n≡35*96 mod101.

Compute 35*96:

35*96=35*(100 -4)=3500 -140=3360.

Now, 3360 divided by101:

101*33=3333, 3360 -3333=27. So 3360≡27 mod101. Therefore, n≡27 mod101.

Therefore, n=101m +27 for some integer m. Then x=20*(101m +27) +3=2020m +540 +3=2020m +543.

Therefore, the smallest non-negative solution is x=543 mod2020. Since 543 is less than 2020, the answer is543.

Wait, but let me check if 543^677 ≡3 mod2020. To verify, we can check modulo4,5,101.

First, modulo4: 543 mod4=543-4*135=543-540=3 mod4. Then 3^677≡3 mod4. Correct.

Modulo5:543 mod5=543-5*108=543-540=3 mod5. Then 3^677≡3 mod5 as earlier. Correct.

Modulo101:543 divided by101:101*5=505, 543-505=38. So 543≡38 mod101. Then 38^677 mod101. But as earlier, 38≡3^13 mod101, so 38^677=3^(13*677). Compute 13*677=8801. Now, since x^100≡1 mod101, reduce 8801 mod100. 8801 divided by100 is88 with remainder1. So 8801≡1 mod100. Therefore, 3^(8801)≡3^1≡3 mod101. So yes, 38^677≡3 mod101. Therefore, all congruences are satisfied.

Therefore, the answer is543.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{543}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \), we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) by solving the congruence modulo the prime power factors of 2020, which are \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 101 \).

1. **Modulo 4**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{4}
   \]
   Since \( 3 \equiv -1 \pmod{4} \) and any odd power of \(-1\) is \(-1\), we get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).

2. **Modulo 5**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{5}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 4 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \), so \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \).

3. **Modulo 101**:
   \[
   x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{101}
   \]
   By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( x^{100} \equiv 1 \pmod{101} \). Reducing the exponent \( 677 \mod 100 \) gives \( 677 \equiv 77 \pmod{100} \). We need to solve \( x^{77} \equiv 3 \pmod{101} \). Finding the inverse of 77 modulo 100 using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we get \( d = 13 \). Thus, \( x \equiv 3^{13} \pmod{101} \). Calculating \( 3^{13} \mod 101 \) gives \( 38 \), so \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \).

Combining these results using CRT:
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \) and \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) to get \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \).
- Combine \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{20} \) with \( x \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \). Solving \( 20n + 3 \equiv 38 \pmod{101} \) gives \( n \equiv 27 \pmod{101} \). Thus, \( x = 20 \cdot 27 + 3 = 543 \).

The smallest non-negative integer \( x \) that satisfies \( x^{677} \equiv 3 \pmod{2020} \) is \(\boxed{543}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Let $s$ be the side length of the square. The rectangle has sides of length $s$ and $s/2$, and its perimeter is $3s = 18$. It follows that $s = 6$, so the area of the original square is $\boxed{36}$.          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Let&#x27;s draw the initial square and the folded rectangle: This diagram can be translated into the equation: \[ p = 2 \times b + 2b \] where p is the perimeter of the folded rectangle and b is the side length of the square. Now we can substitute in our known value: \[ 18 = 2 \times b + 2b.\] Therefore, \[ 18-2b = 2b + 2b \] or \[ 16 = 4b \] Now, diving both sides by 4: \[ 4 = b \] The area of the rectangle, to be found by A=wl, is 4 (since theateral sides are equal in length). Plugging this value back into A=w times l, we get \[ A = (4)(4) = 16. \] \boxed{16}.          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is $2((base)(length))$. We have $18 = 2\left(3\left(x\right)\right)$. So $9 = 3\left(x\right)$, and $x = 3$. There are \boxed{9} square inches.

Response: The diagram is as shown.

The two adjacent pieces are \boxed{9} inches long. Since each piece is \boxed{9} inches in length the pieces are also \boxed{9} inches wide. When two pieces are put together they make a rectangle which is \boxed{9+9=18} inches in length and \boxed{9+9=18} inches in width. The area of this rectangle is 18*18=\boxed{324}.          </p>

Response: We will solve this with the Square Perimeter Formula! Remember that we are trying to solve for x, so we&#x27;ll put it by itself on one side of the equation. First, we&#x27;ll set up the formula: \boxed{\color{magenta}{P=4x} + x=18 \rightarrow 4x+x=18 \rightarrow 5x=18}.

Assistant: We just solved for x, so we can plug it back into the perimeter formula: \boxed{\color{magenta}{P=4x} + x=18 \rightarrow 4x+4x=18 \rightarrow 8x=18 \rightarrow x=\frac{18}{8} \rightarrow x=2.25}

Assistant: Recall that the area is \boxed{\color{magenta}{A=x^2}}. Let&#x27;s substitute the value we just calculated for x: \boxed{\color{magenta}{A=x^2}}=\color{magenta}{4.0625}          </p>

Problem: Find the minimum value of \(|z|\) for complex numbers \(z\) satisfying the equation \(|(z+i)^2-3| = 2|z-i|\). Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Well, we can make the substitution \(z=a+bi\) and note that \(f(a+bi)=\sqrt{(a^2+2bi-a^2-3)^2+4b^2}-2\bar(a+bi)\). Because \(|(z+i)^2-3| = 2|z-i|\), we know \(f\) must attain its minimum at \((0,0)\), the origin in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. \[\frac{f(a+bi)}{|a+bi|^2}=\frac{|(a+bi)^2-3|^2+4b^2}{a^2+b^2}=\frac{(a^2-3)^2+4b^2}{a^2+b^2}-\frac{a^2+a^2+6bi-a^2-a^2-6bi-a^2+3}{a^2+b^2}=\frac{a^4+2a^2b^2+b^4-3}{a^2+b^2}-\frac{a^2-6bi}{a^2+b^2}=\frac{a^4+b^4-6abi-3}{a^2+b^2}\] And, \[\begin{aligned} \frac{\frac{df}{da}}{f} &amp;= \frac{d\big(\frac{a^4+b^4-6abi-3}{a^2+b^2}\big)}{da}=\frac{d\big[\frac{a^4+b^4-6abi-3}{a^2+b^2}\big]}{da} + \frac{d\big(\frac{a^2+b^2}{a^2+b^2}\big)}{da}=\frac{2a^3+\frac{b^4}{a^2+b^2}}{a^2+b^2}-\frac{a^3+2b^3}{(a^2+b^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}=-\frac{(b^2-a^2)^2}{(a^2+b^2)^\frac{3}{2}}-\frac{2b^3}{(a^2+b^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}=-\frac{2b^3(a^2+b^2)+2b^3b^2}{(a^2+b^2)^{\frac{5}{2}}}\end{aligned}\] By Clairaut&#x27;s theorem, this tells us that, \[\begin{aligned} \frac{df}{db} &amp;= \frac{d[\frac{a^4+b^4-6abi-3}{a^2+b^2}]}{db}+\frac{d[\frac{a^2+b^2}{a^2+b^2}]}{db}=\frac{d[a^4-b^4+6abi+3]}{db}+\frac{2ab}{a^2+b^2}=\frac{(-2a^4+4b^4+6abi^2+6ab)(a+ib)}{(a^2+b^2)^2}\end{aligned}\] Hence, using Clairaut&#x27;s theorem again, we know that this equation has a minima at \((0,0)\). Thus, \[\begin{aligned} f(a+bi) &amp;= \sqrt{(a+bi)^2- 3^2} - 2\bar(a+bi)\\ &amp;= \sqrt{(a^2+2bi-a^2-3)^2+4b^2} - 2(a^2+b^2)\ge \sqrt{(a^2- 3^2)^2+4b^2} - 2(a^2+b^2)\\ &amp;= \sqrt((a^2-3)^2+4b^2}-2(a^2+b^2) = \sqrt(4b^2)-2(a^2+b^2)=\sqrt{4b^2}-2|\bar{b}|\end{aligned}\] \(\frac{df}{da}\) is never zero but \(\frac{df}{db}\) is. \(\sqrt{4b^2}-2(b+|b|)\) is at its minima at \((0,0)\), as we saw before. Since \(|\bar{b}|\) lies along the negative \(y\)-axis, it is minimised at 0 and \(\sqrt{4b^2}\). So, \(f(b)=\sqrt{4}\). \(\boxed{2}\)          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The question is asking for the minimum value of |z| where z is a complex number that satisfies the equation |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Hmm, complex numbers and modulus... I remember that complex numbers can be represented in the complex plane, so maybe I can translate this equation into geometric terms?

First, let me recall that for a complex number z = x + yi, |z| is the modulus, which is √(x² + y²). So |z| represents the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) in the plane. The problem wants the minimum such distance among all z that satisfy the given equation.

The equation given is |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Let me try to break this down. Let&#x27;s substitute z = x + yi into the equation. Then z + i = x + (y + 1)i. Squaring that gives (x + (y + 1)i)². Let me compute that:

(x + (y + 1)i)² = x² + 2x(y + 1)i + [(y + 1)i]²
= x² + 2x(y + 1)i - (y + 1)²
= (x² - (y + 1)²) + 2x(y + 1)i

So (z + i)² - 3 would be [(x² - (y + 1)²) - 3] + 2x(y + 1)i. Then the modulus of this is equal to 2|z - i|. Let&#x27;s compute both sides.

Left side modulus: sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side: 2|z - i| = 2| x + (y - 1)i | = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

So, the equation becomes:

sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²] = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

Hmm, that looks complicated. Maybe squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots would help. Let me try that.

Left side squared: [(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side squared: 4(x² + (y - 1)²)

So expanding the left side:

First, let me denote A = x² - (y + 1)² - 3, and B = 2x(y + 1). Then the left side squared is A² + B².

Compute A²:

[x² - (y + 1)² - 3]^2

Let me expand (y + 1)² first: y² + 2y + 1. So x² - (y² + 2y + 1) - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 1 - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 4.

Therefore, A = x² - y² - 2y - 4, so A² = (x² - y² - 2y - 4)²

Similarly, B = 2x(y + 1), so B² = 4x²(y + 1)²

So left side squared becomes:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4(x² + (y - 1)^2)

Let me expand the right side:

4(x² + y² - 2y + 1) = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

So now, the equation is:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

Hmm, this seems really messy. Maybe there&#x27;s a better way to approach this problem instead of expanding everything. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let w = z - i. Then z = w + i. Let me substitute that into the original equation.

So, |(w + i + i)² - 3| = 2|w + i - i| =&gt; |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

Maybe this substitution simplifies things. Let&#x27;s denote w = a + bi. Then w + 2i = a + (b + 2)i. Then (w + 2i)² is [a + (b + 2)i]² = a² + 2a(b + 2)i + [(b + 2)i]^2 = a² + 2a(b + 2)i - (b + 2)^2

So (w + 2i)^2 - 3 = [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3] + 2a(b + 2)i

Then the modulus squared is [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4|w|^2 = 4(a² + b²)

So expanding the left side:

[a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4(a² + b²)

Let me compute [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2. First, expand (b + 2)^2: b² + 4b + 4. So a² - b² -4b -4 -3 = a² - b² -4b -7. So the first term is (a² - b² -4b -7)^2.

Second term: [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4a²(b + 2)^2

So left side becomes:

(a² - b² -4b -7)^2 + 4a²(b + 2)^2 = 4a² + 4b²

This still seems complicated, but maybe expanding the left side will lead to some cancellation.

First, let&#x27;s expand (a² - b² -4b -7)^2:

= (a²)^2 + (-b² -4b -7)^2 + 2a²(-b² -4b -7)

= a^4 + (b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b² + 56b) + (-2a²b² -8a²b -14a²)

Wait, that&#x27;s a bit messy. Let me do it step by step.

Let me denote C = a² and D = -b² -4b -7. Then (C + D)^2 = C² + 2CD + D².

C² = (a²)^2 = a^4

2CD = 2a²(-b² -4b -7) = -2a²b² -8a²b -14a²

D² = (-b² -4b -7)^2. Let&#x27;s compute that:

= (b² +4b +7)^2

= (b²)^2 + (4b)^2 + (7)^2 + 2*b²*4b + 2*b²*7 + 2*4b*7

= b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b^2 + 56b

= b^4 + 8b^3 + (16b^2 +14b^2) +56b +49

= b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So D² = b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So putting it all together, (a² - b² -4b -7)^2 = a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, adding the second term: 4a²(b + 2)^2

First compute (b + 2)^2 = b² +4b +4. Then 4a²*(b² +4b +4) = 4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

So the entire left side becomes:

a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 +4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

a^4: a^4

a²b² terms: -2a²b² +4a²b² = 2a²b²

a²b terms: -8a²b +16a²b = 8a²b

a² terms: -14a² +16a² = 2a²

b^4: b^4

b^3:8b^3

b^2:30b^2

b terms:56b

constants:49

So left side simplifies to:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, the right side is 4a² +4b²

Therefore, the equation is:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 = 4a² +4b²

Bringing all terms to the left side:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 -4a² -4b² =0

Simplify:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b + (2a² -4a²) + b^4 +8b^3 + (30b^2 -4b^2) +56b +49 =0

Which simplifies to:

a^4 +2a²b² +8a²b -2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +26b^2 +56b +49=0

Hmm, this still looks quite complicated. Maybe there&#x27;s a different approach here. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z - i|

Perhaps instead of substituting z = x + yi, I can interpret this geometrically. Let me recall that for complex numbers, |A - B| represents the distance between points A and B in the complex plane.

But here, the equation is |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Hmm, that&#x27;s not a straightforward distance. Alternatively, maybe I can see (z + i)^2 as some transformation of z. Squaring a complex number can be seen as a geometric transformation: squaring the modulus and doubling the angle. But I&#x27;m not sure how that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe set w = z + i, so z = w - i. Then the equation becomes |w² - 3| = 2|w - 2i|

But maybe this substitution can help. Let me check:

Original substitution: z = w - i, so z + i = w, and z - i = w - 2i. Then the equation |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

So we have |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Maybe this is easier to handle. Let me denote w = a + bi. Then w² = (a + bi)^2 = a² - b² + 2abi. Then w² - 3 = (a² - b² -3) + 2abi. The modulus of this is sqrt[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] and the right side is 2*sqrt[a² + (b - 2)^2]. Then squaring both sides:

[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] = 4[a² + (b -2)^2]

But this seems similar to the previous approach. Maybe expanding this will lead to the same equation.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a parametrization or polar coordinates. Let me try that. Let me set w = r e^{iθ}, where r = |w|, θ is the argument.

Then |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Expressing in polar coordinates:

|r² e^{i2θ} -3| = 2 | r e^{iθ} - 2i|

But this might not lead to an easy equation either. Let me compute both sides.

Left side modulus: |r² e^{i2θ} -3|. This is the distance from the point (r² cos 2θ, r² sin 2θ) to (3, 0).

Right side: 2|r e^{iθ} - 2i| = 2| (r cos θ) + i(r sin θ - 2)| = 2 sqrt[ (r cos θ)^2 + (r sin θ -2)^2 ]

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps consider specific points. For example, if z is real, then z = x, so y =0. Then compute if that satisfies the equation.

But maybe that&#x27;s too restrictive. The minimum |z| might not occur on the real axis. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus. Let me consider that |z| is the distance from the origin, and we need to minimize this distance subject to the constraint |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. So this is an optimization problem with a constraint. Maybe Lagrange multipliers?

Yes, that&#x27;s a possible approach. Let me try that.

Let me denote z = x + yi. Then |z| = sqrt(x² + y²). We need to minimize x² + y² (since sqrt is increasing, minimizing sqrt(x² + y²) is equivalent to minimizing x² + y²).

The constraint is |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0. Let me denote f(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

So using Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of the objective function and the constraint should be proportional.

The objective function is F(x, y) = x² + y².

The constraint is G(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

Compute ∇F = [2x, 2y]

Compute ∇G. This is a bit involved, but let&#x27;s recall that for a function G(x,y) = |A(x, y)| - |B(x, y)|, the gradient is (∇|A| - ∇|B|). So need to compute gradients of |(z +i)^2 -3| and 2|z -i|.

Let me first compute |(z +i)^2 -3|.

Let me denote A = (z +i)^2 -3. Then |A| is modulus of A.

Express A in terms of x and y. As earlier, z = x + yi, so z +i = x + (y +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = x² - (y +1)^2 + 2x(y +1)i. Then subtract 3: [x² - (y +1)^2 -3] + 2x(y +1)i. So A = u + vi where u = x² - (y +1)^2 -3 and v = 2x(y +1).

Thus, |A| = sqrt(u² + v²). The gradient of |A| is ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) )

Similarly, |B| where B = z -i = x + (y -1)i, so |B| = sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2). The gradient of |B| is (x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2), (y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2))

Therefore, gradient of G = ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*(x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*((y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)) )

This seems very complicated, but maybe at the minimal point, there is some symmetry or simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps parameterizing the problem. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|

Let me let z -i = w. Then z = w + i. Then z + i = w + 2i. So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)^2 -3| = 2|w|

So |w² +4i w -4 -3| =2|w|, since (w + 2i)^2 = w² +4i w + (2i)^2 = w² +4i w -4. Then subtract 3: w² +4i w -7.

Thus, |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|

Hmm, maybe if I write this as |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|, perhaps dividing both sides by |w| (assuming w ≠0):

| w +4i -7/w | =2

But not sure if this helps. Let me check:

If w ≠0, then divide both sides by |w|:

| (w² +4i w -7)/w | =2 =&gt; |w +4i -7/w| =2

But this might not necessarily help. Alternatively, set t = w, then |t² +4i t -7| =2|t|. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |t² +4i t -7|² =4|t|²

So (t² +4i t -7)(\overline{t² +4i t -7}) =4|t|²

But this is getting too algebraic. Let me try to write t as x + yi.

Let t = x + yi. Then t² = (x + yi)^2 = x² - y² + 2xyi

4i t =4i(x + yi) = -4y +4x i

So t² +4i t -7 = (x² - y² -4y -7) + (2xy +4x)i

Thus, modulus squared is (x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4(x² + y²)

So equation:

(x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4x² +4y²

Wait, this is the same equation I had earlier when substituting w = t = z -i. So seems like we end up at the same quartic equation. Maybe expanding is the way to go.

Let me try expanding the left side:

First term: (x² - y² -4y -7)^2

Let me expand this:

= (x²)^2 + (-y² -4y -7)^2 + 2x²*(-y² -4y -7)

= x^4 + (y^4 +16y² +49 +8y^3 +14y² +56y) + (-2x²y² -8x²y -14x²)

Wait, similar to before:

Wait, (-y² -4y -7)^2 = (y² +4y +7)^2 = y^4 +8y^3 + (16y² +14y²) +56y +49 = y^4 +8y^3 +30y^2 +56y +49

And the cross term is 2x²*(-y² -4y -7) = -2x²y² -8x²y -14x²

Second term: (2xy +4x)^2 =4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

So left side total:

x^4 + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -2x²y² -8x²y -14x² +4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

Combine like terms:

x^4 + [y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49] + [(-2x²y² +4x²y²) + (-8x²y +16x²y) + (-14x² +16x²)]

Simplify each group:

x^4 remains.

y terms: y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

x²y² terms: (-2 +4)x²y² =2x²y²

x²y terms: (-8 +16)x²y =8x²y

x² terms: (-14 +16)x² =2x²

So left side becomes:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

Set equal to right side 4x² +4y²:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 =4x² +4y²

Bring all terms to left side:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -4x² -4y²=0

Simplify:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y + (2x² -4x²) + y^4 +8y^3 + (30y² -4y²) +56y +49=0

Which simplifies to:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y -2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

This equation is still very complicated. Maybe factorizing or looking for possible substitutions.

Alternatively, maybe trying specific values. For example, suppose x =0. Then the equation becomes:

0 +0 +0 -0 + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

Which is y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0. Let me check if this has real roots. Hmm, possible rational roots are ±1,±7,±49. Testing y = -1:

1 -8 +26 -56 +49 =12 ≠0

y=-7: (-7)^4 +8*(-7)^3 +26*(-7)^2 +56*(-7) +49=2401 -2744 +1274 -392 +49= 2401 -2744= -343; -343 +1274=931; 931 -392=539; 539 +49=588≠0

Not zero. Maybe it factors into quadratics?

Suppose y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49 = (y² + a y + b)(y² +c y +d)

Multiply out:

y^4 + (a +c)y³ + (ac +b +d)y² + (ad + bc)y + bd

Set coefficients:

a +c=8

ac +b +d=26

ad + bc=56

bd=49

Since bd=49, possible pairs (b,d)=(7,7), (49,1), (-7,-7), etc. Let&#x27;s try positive integers first. 7 and7. Then b=7, d=7.

Then a +c=8

ac +7 +7=26 =&gt; ac=12

ad + bc=56 =&gt;7a +7c=56 =&gt;a +c=8. Which matches the first equation. So from a +c=8 and ac=12. Solving:

a and c are roots of t² -8t +12=0. Which factors as (t -6)(t -2)=0. So a=6, c=2 or a=2, c=6.

Check ad + bc: if a=6, c=2, then 7*6 +7*2=42 +14=56. Yes, works. Similarly if a=2, c=6: 7*2 +7*6=14 +42=56. So works.

Therefore, the quartic factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0

So setting x=0, the equation factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0. The roots would be y = [-6 ±sqrt(36 -28)]/2 = [-6 ±sqrt(8)]/2 = [-6 ±2√2]/2 = -3 ±√2. Similarly for the other quadratic: y = [-2 ±sqrt(4 -28)]/2. But sqrt(-24) is imaginary. So real roots are y = -3 +√2 and y = -3 -√2. But since x=0, then z =0 + yi -i = y -i. Wait, no. Wait, we set t = z -i =w, then x and y are coordinates of w. So z = w +i. If w has x=0, then z =0 + (y +1)i. So |z| = sqrt(0 + (y +1)^2) = |y +1|. The real roots for y are -3 ±√2. So |z| would be | (-3 ±√2 ) +1 | = | -2 ±√2 |. So |-2 +√2| and |-2 -√2|. Since √2≈1.414, so -2 +1.414≈-0.586, absolute value≈0.586. The other is |-2 -1.414|=3.414. So minimum |z| is approximately 0.586 when x=0. But is this the minimal overall? Because maybe when x≠0, we can get a smaller |z|.

But first, let&#x27;s check if these points are indeed solutions. If x=0 and y = -3 +√2, then w =0 + (-3 +√2)i, so z = w +i = (-3 +√2)i +i = (-2 +√2)i. Then |z| = | -2 +√2 | ≈0.586. Similarly, the other root gives |z|=3.414. So perhaps 2 -√2 is approximately0.586, which is 2 -1.414≈0.586.

But the question is whether there are other solutions with x≠0 that have smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal |z| occurs on the y-axis (x=0). Let me check that.

If x=0, then z = (0) + (y +1)i. So |z| is |y +1|. The minimal |y +1| occurs at y = -1, which gives |z|=0. But does y=-1 satisfy the equation? Let&#x27;s check.

If x=0 and y=-1, then w = z -i = (0 + (-1)i) -i = -2i. Then check |(w +2i)^2 -3| = |(-2i +2i)^2 -3| = |0 -3| =3. And 2|w| =2*| -2i | =4. 3≠4, so y=-1 is not a solution.

Wait, but when x=0, we had solutions at y= -3 ±√2. The minimal |z| for x=0 is | -2 +√2 |≈0.586. Let&#x27;s see if we can find a solution with x≠0 that has a smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal occurs at another point. Let me consider that |z| is minimal when z is closest to the origin on the curve defined by |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Maybe this curve is a circle or some conic section.

Alternatively, notice that the original equation can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Let me consider squaring both sides:

|(z +i)^2 -3|² = 4|z -i|²

Which can be written as [(z +i)^2 -3][\overline{(z +i)^2 -3}] =4(z -i)(\overline{z -i})

But this might not help unless expanded. Let me try writing z = x + yi and expanding everything again.

Alternatively, maybe notice that (z +i)^2 -3 is a quadratic in z, so the equation represents some quadratic curve. The set of points z where |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i| is likely a circle or an ellipse or hyperbola.

Alternatively, think of this as |(z +i)^2 -3| / |z -i| =2. So the ratio of distances is 2, which resembles the definition of an Apollonius circle. However, typically, Apollonius circle is |z -a| / |z -b| =k, which is a circle. But here, the numerator is |(z +i)^2 -3|, which is not a linear function, so the locus is not a circle. So maybe it&#x27;s a quartic curve.

Given that, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs at one of the points we found on the y-axis. But to confirm, perhaps consider other points.

Alternatively, parameterize the problem with z = ti where t is real. Let me try z = ti, then |z| = |t|. Let&#x27;s check if this satisfies the equation.

z = ti, so z +i = ti +i = (t +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = -(t +1)^2. Then (z +i)^2 -3 = - (t +1)^2 -3. The modulus is | - (t +1)^2 -3 | = (t +1)^2 +3.

On the other side, 2|z -i| =2| ti -i | =2| (t -1)i | =2|t -1|

So the equation becomes (t +1)^2 +3 =2|t -1|

Let me solve this equation.

Case 1: t &gt;=1. Then |t -1|=t -1.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3 =2(t -1)

Expand left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2t -2

So t² +2t +4 =2t -2

t² +6=0. No real solutions.

Case 2: t &lt;1. Then |t -1|=1 -t.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3=2(1 -t)

Left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2 -2t

So t² +2t +4 =2 -2t

t² +4t +2 =0

Solutions: t = [-4 ±sqrt(16 -8)]/2 =[-4 ±sqrt(8)]/2 =[-4 ±2√2]/2= -2 ±√2

So t = -2 +√2≈-0.585 and t=-2 -√2≈-3.414

Check if these are less than1: yes, both are.

So z =ti, so |z| =|t|. So the |z| for these solutions are |-2 +√2|≈0.586 and |-2 -√2|≈3.414. So same as before. So when z is purely imaginary, the minimal |z| is 2 -√2≈0.5857.

But is this the minimal overall? Maybe there are other points not on the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

To check, let&#x27;s suppose that minimal |z| occurs at a point not on the y-axis, so x≠0. To verify, perhaps set y such that the derivative is zero, but given the complexity of the equation, this might be difficult.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal |z| is achieved when z is colinear with the origin and the center of some circle... Wait, but the problem is that the equation is not a circle.

Alternatively, use the triangle inequality. Let me see:

We have |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

Note that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= ||(z +i)^2| -|3|| by the reverse triangle inequality. But not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, expand (z +i)^2 -3:

(z +i)^2 -3 = z² +2i z -1 -3 =z² +2i z -4

So the equation is |z² +2i z -4| =2|z -i|

Hmm, still not helpful. Let me see:

If I let z =0, then |0 +0 -4|=4, and 2|0 -i|=2*1=2. So 4≠2, so z=0 is not a solution.

If z approaches 0, then |z² +2i z -4| ≈4, and 2|z -i|≈2*1=2, so LHS &gt;RHS near z=0. So the minimal |z| must be somewhere else.

Alternatively, consider parametrizing z in terms of |z|. Let me write z = r e^{iθ}, then |z|=r. Then we need to express the equation in terms of r and θ.

But this might be complicated. Let me attempt it.

Express z = r e^{iθ}. Then z +i = r e^{iθ} +i. Let me compute (z +i)^2:

(z +i)^2 = (r e^{iθ} +i)^2 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -1

Therefore, (z +i)^2 -3 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4

So modulus squared is |r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4|² = [r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2

And the right side is 2|z -i| =2| r e^{iθ} -i | =2 sqrt(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

So squaring both sides:

[r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2 =4(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

This equation relates r and θ. To find the minimal r, we can try to analyze this equation.

This looks very involved, but perhaps consider specific angles θ where the equation simplifies.

For instance, let me consider θ = -π/2, which would align z along the negative imaginary axis. Then z = -r i.

Compute left side:

[r² cos(-π) -4]^2 + [r² sin(-π) +2r cos(-π/2)]^2

= [r²*(-1) -4]^2 + [0 +2r*0]^2

= (-r² -4)^2 +0 = (r² +4)^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r*(-1))=4(r² +1 +2r)=4r² +4 +8r

Set equal:

(r² +4)^2 =4r² +8r +4

Expand left: r^4 +8r² +16

So equation: r^4 +8r² +16 =4r² +8r +4

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +4r² -8r +12=0

Not sure if this factors. Testing r=1:1 +4 -8 +12=9≠0

r=2:16 +16 -16 +12=28≠0

No obvious roots. So θ=-π/2 might not yield solutions.

Alternatively, take θ=0, so z is real positive. Then z =r.

Left side:

[r² cos0 -4]^2 +[r² sin0 +2r cos0]^2

= (r² -4)^2 + (0 +2r)^2 = (r² -4)^2 +4r²

Right side:

4(r² +1 -0)=4r² +4

Set equal:

(r² -4)^2 +4r² =4r² +4

Simplify: (r² -4)^2 =4

Take sqrt: r² -4=±2

Case1: r² -4=2 =&gt;r²=6 =&gt;r=√6≈2.449

Case2: r² -4=-2 =&gt;r²=2 =&gt;r=√2≈1.414

So θ=0, solutions at r=√2 and r=√6. So |z|=√2≈1.414 and √6≈2.449. But earlier, on the imaginary axis, we had |z|=2 -√2≈0.586, which is smaller. So these are not minimal.

Alternatively, check θ=π/2, z=ri, but already considered that case.

Alternatively, suppose θ=π/4. Then z = r e^{iπ/4}= r(√2/2 +i√2/2)

Compute left side:

[r² cos(π/2) -4]^2 + [r² sin(π/2) +2r cos(π/4)]^2

= [0 -4]^2 + [r²*1 +2r*(√2/2)]^2

=16 + [r² +√2 r]^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r sin(π/4))=4(r² +1 -2r*(√2/2))=4(r² +1 -√2 r)

Set equal:

16 + (r² +√2 r)^2 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Expand left:

16 +r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r²

Equation:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r² +16 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 -2r² +4√2 r +12=0

This seems difficult to solve. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis, as previously found. To confirm, maybe check another angle.

Alternatively, notice that when we substituted z =ti (i.e., x=0), we found solutions with |z|=2 -√2 and 2 +√2. The smaller one is 2 -√2≈0.5858.

But we need to check if there are any other solutions off the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

Suppose there exists a point z with |z| &lt;2 -√2. Let me assume such a point exists and see if it leads to a contradiction.

Let |z|=r &lt;2 -√2≈0.5858.

But since |z -i| &gt;= | |z| - |i| | = |r -1|. So 2|z -i| &gt;=2(1 -r)

On the other hand, |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= |(z +i)^2| +| -3| = |z +i|² +3. Since |z +i| &lt;=|z| +|i|=r +1. So |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

But we have equality |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So if 2(1 -r) &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

Let me check if this holds for r &lt;2 -√2.

Compute RHS - LHS = (r +1)^2 +3 -2(1 -r)=r² +2r +1 +3 -2 +2r=r² +4r +2

Which is positive for all real r. So this inequality holds for any r, but that doesn&#x27;t give us a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps using other inequalities. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= | |(z +i)^2| - |3| |. Which is | |z +i|² -3 |.

So we have | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;= |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;=2|z -i|

But not sure how helpful this is.

Alternatively, let me assume that the minimal |z| occurs at the point we found on the imaginary axis, 2 -√2≈0.586, and check if there can be any other points with smaller |z|.

Alternatively, note that the equation |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i| can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3|² =4|z -i|², which is the equation we derived earlier. If we assume that the minimal |z| occurs at a point where the gradient is colinear with the position vector, i.e., the point where the curve is tangent to the circle centered at the origin. But calculating this would require using Lagrange multipliers, which is quite involved given the complexity of the equation.

Alternatively, given the earlier solutions on the imaginary axis and given that when minimizing |z|, the closest point might lie on the imaginary axis due to symmetry. Since the equation involves z +i and z -i, which are vertical translations, it&#x27;s possible that the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal value we found is 2 -√2≈0.5858, and since we couldn&#x27;t find any solution with smaller |z|, and given the symmetry, this might be the minimal value.

Therefore, I think the minimal |z| is 2 -√2, achieved when z is on the imaginary axis at z=(-2 +√2)i, so |z|=| -2 +√2 | =2 -√2.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the minimum value of \(|z|\) for complex numbers \(z\) satisfying the equation \(|(z + i)^2 - 3| = 2|z - i|\), we start by substituting \(z = w + i\) where \(w = z - i\). This transforms the equation into \(|(w + 2i)^2 - 3| = 2|w|\).

We then consider \(w = x + yi\) and substitute into the equation. After expanding and simplifying both sides, we find that the equation becomes complex. However, by considering specific cases where \(w\) is purely imaginary (i.e., \(x = 0\)), we simplify the problem.

Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation, we solve for \(y\) and find the roots \(y = -3 \pm \sqrt{2}\). Translating back to \(z\), we get \(z = (-2 + \sqrt{2})i\) and \(z = (-2 - \sqrt{2})i\). The modulus \(|z|\) for these points is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} |\) and \(| -2 - \sqrt{2} |\), respectively.

The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} | = 2 - \sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The question is asking for the minimum value of |z| where z is a complex number that satisfies the equation |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Hmm, complex numbers and modulus... I remember that complex numbers can be represented in the complex plane, so maybe I can translate this equation into geometric terms?

First, let me recall that for a complex number z = x + yi, |z| is the modulus, which is √(x² + y²). So |z| represents the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) in the plane. The problem wants the minimum such distance among all z that satisfy the given equation.

The equation given is |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Let me try to break this down. Let&#x27;s substitute z = x + yi into the equation. Then z + i = x + (y + 1)i. Squaring that gives (x + (y + 1)i)². Let me compute that:

(x + (y + 1)i)² = x² + 2x(y + 1)i + [(y + 1)i]²
= x² + 2x(y + 1)i - (y + 1)²
= (x² - (y + 1)²) + 2x(y + 1)i

So (z + i)² - 3 would be [(x² - (y + 1)²) - 3] + 2x(y + 1)i. Then the modulus of this is equal to 2|z - i|. Let&#x27;s compute both sides.

Left side modulus: sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side: 2|z - i| = 2| x + (y - 1)i | = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

So, the equation becomes:

sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²] = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

Hmm, that looks complicated. Maybe squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots would help. Let me try that.

Left side squared: [(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side squared: 4(x² + (y - 1)²)

So expanding the left side:

First, let me denote A = x² - (y + 1)² - 3, and B = 2x(y + 1). Then the left side squared is A² + B².

Compute A²:

[x² - (y + 1)² - 3]^2

Let me expand (y + 1)² first: y² + 2y + 1. So x² - (y² + 2y + 1) - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 1 - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 4.

Therefore, A = x² - y² - 2y - 4, so A² = (x² - y² - 2y - 4)²

Similarly, B = 2x(y + 1), so B² = 4x²(y + 1)²

So left side squared becomes:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4(x² + (y - 1)^2)

Let me expand the right side:

4(x² + y² - 2y + 1) = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

So now, the equation is:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

Hmm, this seems really messy. Maybe there&#x27;s a better way to approach this problem instead of expanding everything. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let w = z - i. Then z = w + i. Let me substitute that into the original equation.

So, |(w + i + i)² - 3| = 2|w + i - i| =&gt; |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

Maybe this substitution simplifies things. Let&#x27;s denote w = a + bi. Then w + 2i = a + (b + 2)i. Then (w + 2i)² is [a + (b + 2)i]² = a² + 2a(b + 2)i + [(b + 2)i]^2 = a² + 2a(b + 2)i - (b + 2)^2

So (w + 2i)^2 - 3 = [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3] + 2a(b + 2)i

Then the modulus squared is [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4|w|^2 = 4(a² + b²)

So expanding the left side:

[a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4(a² + b²)

Let me compute [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2. First, expand (b + 2)^2: b² + 4b + 4. So a² - b² -4b -4 -3 = a² - b² -4b -7. So the first term is (a² - b² -4b -7)^2.

Second term: [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4a²(b + 2)^2

So left side becomes:

(a² - b² -4b -7)^2 + 4a²(b + 2)^2 = 4a² + 4b²

This still seems complicated, but maybe expanding the left side will lead to some cancellation.

First, let&#x27;s expand (a² - b² -4b -7)^2:

= (a²)^2 + (-b² -4b -7)^2 + 2a²(-b² -4b -7)

= a^4 + (b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b² + 56b) + (-2a²b² -8a²b -14a²)

Wait, that&#x27;s a bit messy. Let me do it step by step.

Let me denote C = a² and D = -b² -4b -7. Then (C + D)^2 = C² + 2CD + D².

C² = (a²)^2 = a^4

2CD = 2a²(-b² -4b -7) = -2a²b² -8a²b -14a²

D² = (-b² -4b -7)^2. Let&#x27;s compute that:

= (b² +4b +7)^2

= (b²)^2 + (4b)^2 + (7)^2 + 2*b²*4b + 2*b²*7 + 2*4b*7

= b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b^2 + 56b

= b^4 + 8b^3 + (16b^2 +14b^2) +56b +49

= b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So D² = b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So putting it all together, (a² - b² -4b -7)^2 = a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, adding the second term: 4a²(b + 2)^2

First compute (b + 2)^2 = b² +4b +4. Then 4a²*(b² +4b +4) = 4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

So the entire left side becomes:

a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 +4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

a^4: a^4

a²b² terms: -2a²b² +4a²b² = 2a²b²

a²b terms: -8a²b +16a²b = 8a²b

a² terms: -14a² +16a² = 2a²

b^4: b^4

b^3:8b^3

b^2:30b^2

b terms:56b

constants:49

So left side simplifies to:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, the right side is 4a² +4b²

Therefore, the equation is:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 = 4a² +4b²

Bringing all terms to the left side:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 -4a² -4b² =0

Simplify:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b + (2a² -4a²) + b^4 +8b^3 + (30b^2 -4b^2) +56b +49 =0

Which simplifies to:

a^4 +2a²b² +8a²b -2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +26b^2 +56b +49=0

Hmm, this still looks quite complicated. Maybe there&#x27;s a different approach here. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z - i|

Perhaps instead of substituting z = x + yi, I can interpret this geometrically. Let me recall that for complex numbers, |A - B| represents the distance between points A and B in the complex plane.

But here, the equation is |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Hmm, that&#x27;s not a straightforward distance. Alternatively, maybe I can see (z + i)^2 as some transformation of z. Squaring a complex number can be seen as a geometric transformation: squaring the modulus and doubling the angle. But I&#x27;m not sure how that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe set w = z + i, so z = w - i. Then the equation becomes |w² - 3| = 2|w - 2i|

But maybe this substitution can help. Let me check:

Original substitution: z = w - i, so z + i = w, and z - i = w - 2i. Then the equation |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

So we have |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Maybe this is easier to handle. Let me denote w = a + bi. Then w² = (a + bi)^2 = a² - b² + 2abi. Then w² - 3 = (a² - b² -3) + 2abi. The modulus of this is sqrt[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] and the right side is 2*sqrt[a² + (b - 2)^2]. Then squaring both sides:

[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] = 4[a² + (b -2)^2]

But this seems similar to the previous approach. Maybe expanding this will lead to the same equation.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a parametrization or polar coordinates. Let me try that. Let me set w = r e^{iθ}, where r = |w|, θ is the argument.

Then |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Expressing in polar coordinates:

|r² e^{i2θ} -3| = 2 | r e^{iθ} - 2i|

But this might not lead to an easy equation either. Let me compute both sides.

Left side modulus: |r² e^{i2θ} -3|. This is the distance from the point (r² cos 2θ, r² sin 2θ) to (3, 0).

Right side: 2|r e^{iθ} - 2i| = 2| (r cos θ) + i(r sin θ - 2)| = 2 sqrt[ (r cos θ)^2 + (r sin θ -2)^2 ]

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps consider specific points. For example, if z is real, then z = x, so y =0. Then compute if that satisfies the equation.

But maybe that&#x27;s too restrictive. The minimum |z| might not occur on the real axis. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus. Let me consider that |z| is the distance from the origin, and we need to minimize this distance subject to the constraint |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. So this is an optimization problem with a constraint. Maybe Lagrange multipliers?

Yes, that&#x27;s a possible approach. Let me try that.

Let me denote z = x + yi. Then |z| = sqrt(x² + y²). We need to minimize x² + y² (since sqrt is increasing, minimizing sqrt(x² + y²) is equivalent to minimizing x² + y²).

The constraint is |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0. Let me denote f(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

So using Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of the objective function and the constraint should be proportional.

The objective function is F(x, y) = x² + y².

The constraint is G(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

Compute ∇F = [2x, 2y]

Compute ∇G. This is a bit involved, but let&#x27;s recall that for a function G(x,y) = |A(x, y)| - |B(x, y)|, the gradient is (∇|A| - ∇|B|). So need to compute gradients of |(z +i)^2 -3| and 2|z -i|.

Let me first compute |(z +i)^2 -3|.

Let me denote A = (z +i)^2 -3. Then |A| is modulus of A.

Express A in terms of x and y. As earlier, z = x + yi, so z +i = x + (y +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = x² - (y +1)^2 + 2x(y +1)i. Then subtract 3: [x² - (y +1)^2 -3] + 2x(y +1)i. So A = u + vi where u = x² - (y +1)^2 -3 and v = 2x(y +1).

Thus, |A| = sqrt(u² + v²). The gradient of |A| is ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) )

Similarly, |B| where B = z -i = x + (y -1)i, so |B| = sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2). The gradient of |B| is (x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2), (y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2))

Therefore, gradient of G = ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*(x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*((y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)) )

This seems very complicated, but maybe at the minimal point, there is some symmetry or simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps parameterizing the problem. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|

Let me let z -i = w. Then z = w + i. Then z + i = w + 2i. So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)^2 -3| = 2|w|

So |w² +4i w -4 -3| =2|w|, since (w + 2i)^2 = w² +4i w + (2i)^2 = w² +4i w -4. Then subtract 3: w² +4i w -7.

Thus, |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|

Hmm, maybe if I write this as |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|, perhaps dividing both sides by |w| (assuming w ≠0):

| w +4i -7/w | =2

But not sure if this helps. Let me check:

If w ≠0, then divide both sides by |w|:

| (w² +4i w -7)/w | =2 =&gt; |w +4i -7/w| =2

But this might not necessarily help. Alternatively, set t = w, then |t² +4i t -7| =2|t|. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |t² +4i t -7|² =4|t|²

So (t² +4i t -7)(\overline{t² +4i t -7}) =4|t|²

But this is getting too algebraic. Let me try to write t as x + yi.

Let t = x + yi. Then t² = (x + yi)^2 = x² - y² + 2xyi

4i t =4i(x + yi) = -4y +4x i

So t² +4i t -7 = (x² - y² -4y -7) + (2xy +4x)i

Thus, modulus squared is (x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4(x² + y²)

So equation:

(x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4x² +4y²

Wait, this is the same equation I had earlier when substituting w = t = z -i. So seems like we end up at the same quartic equation. Maybe expanding is the way to go.

Let me try expanding the left side:

First term: (x² - y² -4y -7)^2

Let me expand this:

= (x²)^2 + (-y² -4y -7)^2 + 2x²*(-y² -4y -7)

= x^4 + (y^4 +16y² +49 +8y^3 +14y² +56y) + (-2x²y² -8x²y -14x²)

Wait, similar to before:

Wait, (-y² -4y -7)^2 = (y² +4y +7)^2 = y^4 +8y^3 + (16y² +14y²) +56y +49 = y^4 +8y^3 +30y^2 +56y +49

And the cross term is 2x²*(-y² -4y -7) = -2x²y² -8x²y -14x²

Second term: (2xy +4x)^2 =4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

So left side total:

x^4 + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -2x²y² -8x²y -14x² +4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

Combine like terms:

x^4 + [y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49] + [(-2x²y² +4x²y²) + (-8x²y +16x²y) + (-14x² +16x²)]

Simplify each group:

x^4 remains.

y terms: y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

x²y² terms: (-2 +4)x²y² =2x²y²

x²y terms: (-8 +16)x²y =8x²y

x² terms: (-14 +16)x² =2x²

So left side becomes:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

Set equal to right side 4x² +4y²:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 =4x² +4y²

Bring all terms to left side:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -4x² -4y²=0

Simplify:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y + (2x² -4x²) + y^4 +8y^3 + (30y² -4y²) +56y +49=0

Which simplifies to:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y -2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

This equation is still very complicated. Maybe factorizing or looking for possible substitutions.

Alternatively, maybe trying specific values. For example, suppose x =0. Then the equation becomes:

0 +0 +0 -0 + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

Which is y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0. Let me check if this has real roots. Hmm, possible rational roots are ±1,±7,±49. Testing y = -1:

1 -8 +26 -56 +49 =12 ≠0

y=-7: (-7)^4 +8*(-7)^3 +26*(-7)^2 +56*(-7) +49=2401 -2744 +1274 -392 +49= 2401 -2744= -343; -343 +1274=931; 931 -392=539; 539 +49=588≠0

Not zero. Maybe it factors into quadratics?

Suppose y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49 = (y² + a y + b)(y² +c y +d)

Multiply out:

y^4 + (a +c)y³ + (ac +b +d)y² + (ad + bc)y + bd

Set coefficients:

a +c=8

ac +b +d=26

ad + bc=56

bd=49

Since bd=49, possible pairs (b,d)=(7,7), (49,1), (-7,-7), etc. Let&#x27;s try positive integers first. 7 and7. Then b=7, d=7.

Then a +c=8

ac +7 +7=26 =&gt; ac=12

ad + bc=56 =&gt;7a +7c=56 =&gt;a +c=8. Which matches the first equation. So from a +c=8 and ac=12. Solving:

a and c are roots of t² -8t +12=0. Which factors as (t -6)(t -2)=0. So a=6, c=2 or a=2, c=6.

Check ad + bc: if a=6, c=2, then 7*6 +7*2=42 +14=56. Yes, works. Similarly if a=2, c=6: 7*2 +7*6=14 +42=56. So works.

Therefore, the quartic factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0

So setting x=0, the equation factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0. The roots would be y = [-6 ±sqrt(36 -28)]/2 = [-6 ±sqrt(8)]/2 = [-6 ±2√2]/2 = -3 ±√2. Similarly for the other quadratic: y = [-2 ±sqrt(4 -28)]/2. But sqrt(-24) is imaginary. So real roots are y = -3 +√2 and y = -3 -√2. But since x=0, then z =0 + yi -i = y -i. Wait, no. Wait, we set t = z -i =w, then x and y are coordinates of w. So z = w +i. If w has x=0, then z =0 + (y +1)i. So |z| = sqrt(0 + (y +1)^2) = |y +1|. The real roots for y are -3 ±√2. So |z| would be | (-3 ±√2 ) +1 | = | -2 ±√2 |. So |-2 +√2| and |-2 -√2|. Since √2≈1.414, so -2 +1.414≈-0.586, absolute value≈0.586. The other is |-2 -1.414|=3.414. So minimum |z| is approximately 0.586 when x=0. But is this the minimal overall? Because maybe when x≠0, we can get a smaller |z|.

But first, let&#x27;s check if these points are indeed solutions. If x=0 and y = -3 +√2, then w =0 + (-3 +√2)i, so z = w +i = (-3 +√2)i +i = (-2 +√2)i. Then |z| = | -2 +√2 | ≈0.586. Similarly, the other root gives |z|=3.414. So perhaps 2 -√2 is approximately0.586, which is 2 -1.414≈0.586.

But the question is whether there are other solutions with x≠0 that have smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal |z| occurs on the y-axis (x=0). Let me check that.

If x=0, then z = (0) + (y +1)i. So |z| is |y +1|. The minimal |y +1| occurs at y = -1, which gives |z|=0. But does y=-1 satisfy the equation? Let&#x27;s check.

If x=0 and y=-1, then w = z -i = (0 + (-1)i) -i = -2i. Then check |(w +2i)^2 -3| = |(-2i +2i)^2 -3| = |0 -3| =3. And 2|w| =2*| -2i | =4. 3≠4, so y=-1 is not a solution.

Wait, but when x=0, we had solutions at y= -3 ±√2. The minimal |z| for x=0 is | -2 +√2 |≈0.586. Let&#x27;s see if we can find a solution with x≠0 that has a smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal occurs at another point. Let me consider that |z| is minimal when z is closest to the origin on the curve defined by |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Maybe this curve is a circle or some conic section.

Alternatively, notice that the original equation can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Let me consider squaring both sides:

|(z +i)^2 -3|² = 4|z -i|²

Which can be written as [(z +i)^2 -3][\overline{(z +i)^2 -3}] =4(z -i)(\overline{z -i})

But this might not help unless expanded. Let me try writing z = x + yi and expanding everything again.

Alternatively, maybe notice that (z +i)^2 -3 is a quadratic in z, so the equation represents some quadratic curve. The set of points z where |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i| is likely a circle or an ellipse or hyperbola.

Alternatively, think of this as |(z +i)^2 -3| / |z -i| =2. So the ratio of distances is 2, which resembles the definition of an Apollonius circle. However, typically, Apollonius circle is |z -a| / |z -b| =k, which is a circle. But here, the numerator is |(z +i)^2 -3|, which is not a linear function, so the locus is not a circle. So maybe it&#x27;s a quartic curve.

Given that, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs at one of the points we found on the y-axis. But to confirm, perhaps consider other points.

Alternatively, parameterize the problem with z = ti where t is real. Let me try z = ti, then |z| = |t|. Let&#x27;s check if this satisfies the equation.

z = ti, so z +i = ti +i = (t +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = -(t +1)^2. Then (z +i)^2 -3 = - (t +1)^2 -3. The modulus is | - (t +1)^2 -3 | = (t +1)^2 +3.

On the other side, 2|z -i| =2| ti -i | =2| (t -1)i | =2|t -1|

So the equation becomes (t +1)^2 +3 =2|t -1|

Let me solve this equation.

Case 1: t &gt;=1. Then |t -1|=t -1.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3 =2(t -1)

Expand left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2t -2

So t² +2t +4 =2t -2

t² +6=0. No real solutions.

Case 2: t &lt;1. Then |t -1|=1 -t.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3=2(1 -t)

Left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2 -2t

So t² +2t +4 =2 -2t

t² +4t +2 =0

Solutions: t = [-4 ±sqrt(16 -8)]/2 =[-4 ±sqrt(8)]/2 =[-4 ±2√2]/2= -2 ±√2

So t = -2 +√2≈-0.585 and t=-2 -√2≈-3.414

Check if these are less than1: yes, both are.

So z =ti, so |z| =|t|. So the |z| for these solutions are |-2 +√2|≈0.586 and |-2 -√2|≈3.414. So same as before. So when z is purely imaginary, the minimal |z| is 2 -√2≈0.5857.

But is this the minimal overall? Maybe there are other points not on the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

To check, let&#x27;s suppose that minimal |z| occurs at a point not on the y-axis, so x≠0. To verify, perhaps set y such that the derivative is zero, but given the complexity of the equation, this might be difficult.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal |z| is achieved when z is colinear with the origin and the center of some circle... Wait, but the problem is that the equation is not a circle.

Alternatively, use the triangle inequality. Let me see:

We have |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

Note that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= ||(z +i)^2| -|3|| by the reverse triangle inequality. But not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, expand (z +i)^2 -3:

(z +i)^2 -3 = z² +2i z -1 -3 =z² +2i z -4

So the equation is |z² +2i z -4| =2|z -i|

Hmm, still not helpful. Let me see:

If I let z =0, then |0 +0 -4|=4, and 2|0 -i|=2*1=2. So 4≠2, so z=0 is not a solution.

If z approaches 0, then |z² +2i z -4| ≈4, and 2|z -i|≈2*1=2, so LHS &gt;RHS near z=0. So the minimal |z| must be somewhere else.

Alternatively, consider parametrizing z in terms of |z|. Let me write z = r e^{iθ}, then |z|=r. Then we need to express the equation in terms of r and θ.

But this might be complicated. Let me attempt it.

Express z = r e^{iθ}. Then z +i = r e^{iθ} +i. Let me compute (z +i)^2:

(z +i)^2 = (r e^{iθ} +i)^2 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -1

Therefore, (z +i)^2 -3 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4

So modulus squared is |r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4|² = [r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2

And the right side is 2|z -i| =2| r e^{iθ} -i | =2 sqrt(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

So squaring both sides:

[r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2 =4(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

This equation relates r and θ. To find the minimal r, we can try to analyze this equation.

This looks very involved, but perhaps consider specific angles θ where the equation simplifies.

For instance, let me consider θ = -π/2, which would align z along the negative imaginary axis. Then z = -r i.

Compute left side:

[r² cos(-π) -4]^2 + [r² sin(-π) +2r cos(-π/2)]^2

= [r²*(-1) -4]^2 + [0 +2r*0]^2

= (-r² -4)^2 +0 = (r² +4)^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r*(-1))=4(r² +1 +2r)=4r² +4 +8r

Set equal:

(r² +4)^2 =4r² +8r +4

Expand left: r^4 +8r² +16

So equation: r^4 +8r² +16 =4r² +8r +4

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +4r² -8r +12=0

Not sure if this factors. Testing r=1:1 +4 -8 +12=9≠0

r=2:16 +16 -16 +12=28≠0

No obvious roots. So θ=-π/2 might not yield solutions.

Alternatively, take θ=0, so z is real positive. Then z =r.

Left side:

[r² cos0 -4]^2 +[r² sin0 +2r cos0]^2

= (r² -4)^2 + (0 +2r)^2 = (r² -4)^2 +4r²

Right side:

4(r² +1 -0)=4r² +4

Set equal:

(r² -4)^2 +4r² =4r² +4

Simplify: (r² -4)^2 =4

Take sqrt: r² -4=±2

Case1: r² -4=2 =&gt;r²=6 =&gt;r=√6≈2.449

Case2: r² -4=-2 =&gt;r²=2 =&gt;r=√2≈1.414

So θ=0, solutions at r=√2 and r=√6. So |z|=√2≈1.414 and √6≈2.449. But earlier, on the imaginary axis, we had |z|=2 -√2≈0.586, which is smaller. So these are not minimal.

Alternatively, check θ=π/2, z=ri, but already considered that case.

Alternatively, suppose θ=π/4. Then z = r e^{iπ/4}= r(√2/2 +i√2/2)

Compute left side:

[r² cos(π/2) -4]^2 + [r² sin(π/2) +2r cos(π/4)]^2

= [0 -4]^2 + [r²*1 +2r*(√2/2)]^2

=16 + [r² +√2 r]^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r sin(π/4))=4(r² +1 -2r*(√2/2))=4(r² +1 -√2 r)

Set equal:

16 + (r² +√2 r)^2 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Expand left:

16 +r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r²

Equation:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r² +16 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 -2r² +4√2 r +12=0

This seems difficult to solve. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis, as previously found. To confirm, maybe check another angle.

Alternatively, notice that when we substituted z =ti (i.e., x=0), we found solutions with |z|=2 -√2 and 2 +√2. The smaller one is 2 -√2≈0.5858.

But we need to check if there are any other solutions off the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

Suppose there exists a point z with |z| &lt;2 -√2. Let me assume such a point exists and see if it leads to a contradiction.

Let |z|=r &lt;2 -√2≈0.5858.

But since |z -i| &gt;= | |z| - |i| | = |r -1|. So 2|z -i| &gt;=2(1 -r)

On the other hand, |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= |(z +i)^2| +| -3| = |z +i|² +3. Since |z +i| &lt;=|z| +|i|=r +1. So |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

But we have equality |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So if 2(1 -r) &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

Let me check if this holds for r &lt;2 -√2.

Compute RHS - LHS = (r +1)^2 +3 -2(1 -r)=r² +2r +1 +3 -2 +2r=r² +4r +2

Which is positive for all real r. So this inequality holds for any r, but that doesn&#x27;t give us a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps using other inequalities. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= | |(z +i)^2| - |3| |. Which is | |z +i|² -3 |.

So we have | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;= |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;=2|z -i|

But not sure how helpful this is.

Alternatively, let me assume that the minimal |z| occurs at the point we found on the imaginary axis, 2 -√2≈0.586, and check if there can be any other points with smaller |z|.

Alternatively, note that the equation |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i| can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3|² =4|z -i|², which is the equation we derived earlier. If we assume that the minimal |z| occurs at a point where the gradient is colinear with the position vector, i.e., the point where the curve is tangent to the circle centered at the origin. But calculating this would require using Lagrange multipliers, which is quite involved given the complexity of the equation.

Alternatively, given the earlier solutions on the imaginary axis and given that when minimizing |z|, the closest point might lie on the imaginary axis due to symmetry. Since the equation involves z +i and z -i, which are vertical translations, it&#x27;s possible that the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal value we found is 2 -√2≈0.5858, and since we couldn&#x27;t find any solution with smaller |z|, and given the symmetry, this might be the minimal value.

Therefore, I think the minimal |z| is 2 -√2, achieved when z is on the imaginary axis at z=(-2 +√2)i, so |z|=| -2 +√2 | =2 -√2.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the minimum value of \(|z|\) for complex numbers \(z\) satisfying the equation \(|(z + i)^2 - 3| = 2|z - i|\), we start by substituting \(z = w + i\) where \(w = z - i\). This transforms the equation into \(|(w + 2i)^2 - 3| = 2|w|\).

We then consider \(w = x + yi\) and substitute into the equation. After expanding and simplifying both sides, we find that the equation becomes complex. However, by considering specific cases where \(w\) is purely imaginary (i.e., \(x = 0\)), we simplify the problem.

Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation, we solve for \(y\) and find the roots \(y = -3 \pm \sqrt{2}\). Translating back to \(z\), we get \(z = (-2 + \sqrt{2})i\) and \(z = (-2 - \sqrt{2})i\). The modulus \(|z|\) for these points is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} |\) and \(| -2 - \sqrt{2} |\), respectively.

The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} | = 2 - \sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The question is asking for the minimum value of |z| where z is a complex number that satisfies the equation |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Hmm, complex numbers and modulus... I remember that complex numbers can be represented in the complex plane, so maybe I can translate this equation into geometric terms?

First, let me recall that for a complex number z = x + yi, |z| is the modulus, which is √(x² + y²). So |z| represents the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) in the plane. The problem wants the minimum such distance among all z that satisfy the given equation.

The equation given is |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Let me try to break this down. Let&#x27;s substitute z = x + yi into the equation. Then z + i = x + (y + 1)i. Squaring that gives (x + (y + 1)i)². Let me compute that:

(x + (y + 1)i)² = x² + 2x(y + 1)i + [(y + 1)i]²
= x² + 2x(y + 1)i - (y + 1)²
= (x² - (y + 1)²) + 2x(y + 1)i

So (z + i)² - 3 would be [(x² - (y + 1)²) - 3] + 2x(y + 1)i. Then the modulus of this is equal to 2|z - i|. Let&#x27;s compute both sides.

Left side modulus: sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side: 2|z - i| = 2| x + (y - 1)i | = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

So, the equation becomes:

sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²] = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

Hmm, that looks complicated. Maybe squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots would help. Let me try that.

Left side squared: [(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side squared: 4(x² + (y - 1)²)

So expanding the left side:

First, let me denote A = x² - (y + 1)² - 3, and B = 2x(y + 1). Then the left side squared is A² + B².

Compute A²:

[x² - (y + 1)² - 3]^2

Let me expand (y + 1)² first: y² + 2y + 1. So x² - (y² + 2y + 1) - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 1 - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 4.

Therefore, A = x² - y² - 2y - 4, so A² = (x² - y² - 2y - 4)²

Similarly, B = 2x(y + 1), so B² = 4x²(y + 1)²

So left side squared becomes:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4(x² + (y - 1)^2)

Let me expand the right side:

4(x² + y² - 2y + 1) = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

So now, the equation is:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

Hmm, this seems really messy. Maybe there&#x27;s a better way to approach this problem instead of expanding everything. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let w = z - i. Then z = w + i. Let me substitute that into the original equation.

So, |(w + i + i)² - 3| = 2|w + i - i| =&gt; |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

Maybe this substitution simplifies things. Let&#x27;s denote w = a + bi. Then w + 2i = a + (b + 2)i. Then (w + 2i)² is [a + (b + 2)i]² = a² + 2a(b + 2)i + [(b + 2)i]^2 = a² + 2a(b + 2)i - (b + 2)^2

So (w + 2i)^2 - 3 = [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3] + 2a(b + 2)i

Then the modulus squared is [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4|w|^2 = 4(a² + b²)

So expanding the left side:

[a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4(a² + b²)

Let me compute [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2. First, expand (b + 2)^2: b² + 4b + 4. So a² - b² -4b -4 -3 = a² - b² -4b -7. So the first term is (a² - b² -4b -7)^2.

Second term: [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4a²(b + 2)^2

So left side becomes:

(a² - b² -4b -7)^2 + 4a²(b + 2)^2 = 4a² + 4b²

This still seems complicated, but maybe expanding the left side will lead to some cancellation.

First, let&#x27;s expand (a² - b² -4b -7)^2:

= (a²)^2 + (-b² -4b -7)^2 + 2a²(-b² -4b -7)

= a^4 + (b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b² + 56b) + (-2a²b² -8a²b -14a²)

Wait, that&#x27;s a bit messy. Let me do it step by step.

Let me denote C = a² and D = -b² -4b -7. Then (C + D)^2 = C² + 2CD + D².

C² = (a²)^2 = a^4

2CD = 2a²(-b² -4b -7) = -2a²b² -8a²b -14a²

D² = (-b² -4b -7)^2. Let&#x27;s compute that:

= (b² +4b +7)^2

= (b²)^2 + (4b)^2 + (7)^2 + 2*b²*4b + 2*b²*7 + 2*4b*7

= b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b^2 + 56b

= b^4 + 8b^3 + (16b^2 +14b^2) +56b +49

= b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So D² = b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So putting it all together, (a² - b² -4b -7)^2 = a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, adding the second term: 4a²(b + 2)^2

First compute (b + 2)^2 = b² +4b +4. Then 4a²*(b² +4b +4) = 4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

So the entire left side becomes:

a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 +4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

a^4: a^4

a²b² terms: -2a²b² +4a²b² = 2a²b²

a²b terms: -8a²b +16a²b = 8a²b

a² terms: -14a² +16a² = 2a²

b^4: b^4

b^3:8b^3

b^2:30b^2

b terms:56b

constants:49

So left side simplifies to:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, the right side is 4a² +4b²

Therefore, the equation is:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 = 4a² +4b²

Bringing all terms to the left side:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 -4a² -4b² =0

Simplify:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b + (2a² -4a²) + b^4 +8b^3 + (30b^2 -4b^2) +56b +49 =0

Which simplifies to:

a^4 +2a²b² +8a²b -2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +26b^2 +56b +49=0

Hmm, this still looks quite complicated. Maybe there&#x27;s a different approach here. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z - i|

Perhaps instead of substituting z = x + yi, I can interpret this geometrically. Let me recall that for complex numbers, |A - B| represents the distance between points A and B in the complex plane.

But here, the equation is |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Hmm, that&#x27;s not a straightforward distance. Alternatively, maybe I can see (z + i)^2 as some transformation of z. Squaring a complex number can be seen as a geometric transformation: squaring the modulus and doubling the angle. But I&#x27;m not sure how that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe set w = z + i, so z = w - i. Then the equation becomes |w² - 3| = 2|w - 2i|

But maybe this substitution can help. Let me check:

Original substitution: z = w - i, so z + i = w, and z - i = w - 2i. Then the equation |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

So we have |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Maybe this is easier to handle. Let me denote w = a + bi. Then w² = (a + bi)^2 = a² - b² + 2abi. Then w² - 3 = (a² - b² -3) + 2abi. The modulus of this is sqrt[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] and the right side is 2*sqrt[a² + (b - 2)^2]. Then squaring both sides:

[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] = 4[a² + (b -2)^2]

But this seems similar to the previous approach. Maybe expanding this will lead to the same equation.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a parametrization or polar coordinates. Let me try that. Let me set w = r e^{iθ}, where r = |w|, θ is the argument.

Then |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Expressing in polar coordinates:

|r² e^{i2θ} -3| = 2 | r e^{iθ} - 2i|

But this might not lead to an easy equation either. Let me compute both sides.

Left side modulus: |r² e^{i2θ} -3|. This is the distance from the point (r² cos 2θ, r² sin 2θ) to (3, 0).

Right side: 2|r e^{iθ} - 2i| = 2| (r cos θ) + i(r sin θ - 2)| = 2 sqrt[ (r cos θ)^2 + (r sin θ -2)^2 ]

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps consider specific points. For example, if z is real, then z = x, so y =0. Then compute if that satisfies the equation.

But maybe that&#x27;s too restrictive. The minimum |z| might not occur on the real axis. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus. Let me consider that |z| is the distance from the origin, and we need to minimize this distance subject to the constraint |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. So this is an optimization problem with a constraint. Maybe Lagrange multipliers?

Yes, that&#x27;s a possible approach. Let me try that.

Let me denote z = x + yi. Then |z| = sqrt(x² + y²). We need to minimize x² + y² (since sqrt is increasing, minimizing sqrt(x² + y²) is equivalent to minimizing x² + y²).

The constraint is |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0. Let me denote f(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

So using Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of the objective function and the constraint should be proportional.

The objective function is F(x, y) = x² + y².

The constraint is G(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

Compute ∇F = [2x, 2y]

Compute ∇G. This is a bit involved, but let&#x27;s recall that for a function G(x,y) = |A(x, y)| - |B(x, y)|, the gradient is (∇|A| - ∇|B|). So need to compute gradients of |(z +i)^2 -3| and 2|z -i|.

Let me first compute |(z +i)^2 -3|.

Let me denote A = (z +i)^2 -3. Then |A| is modulus of A.

Express A in terms of x and y. As earlier, z = x + yi, so z +i = x + (y +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = x² - (y +1)^2 + 2x(y +1)i. Then subtract 3: [x² - (y +1)^2 -3] + 2x(y +1)i. So A = u + vi where u = x² - (y +1)^2 -3 and v = 2x(y +1).

Thus, |A| = sqrt(u² + v²). The gradient of |A| is ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) )

Similarly, |B| where B = z -i = x + (y -1)i, so |B| = sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2). The gradient of |B| is (x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2), (y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2))

Therefore, gradient of G = ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*(x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*((y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)) )

This seems very complicated, but maybe at the minimal point, there is some symmetry or simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps parameterizing the problem. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|

Let me let z -i = w. Then z = w + i. Then z + i = w + 2i. So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)^2 -3| = 2|w|

So |w² +4i w -4 -3| =2|w|, since (w + 2i)^2 = w² +4i w + (2i)^2 = w² +4i w -4. Then subtract 3: w² +4i w -7.

Thus, |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|

Hmm, maybe if I write this as |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|, perhaps dividing both sides by |w| (assuming w ≠0):

| w +4i -7/w | =2

But not sure if this helps. Let me check:

If w ≠0, then divide both sides by |w|:

| (w² +4i w -7)/w | =2 =&gt; |w +4i -7/w| =2

But this might not necessarily help. Alternatively, set t = w, then |t² +4i t -7| =2|t|. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |t² +4i t -7|² =4|t|²

So (t² +4i t -7)(\overline{t² +4i t -7}) =4|t|²

But this is getting too algebraic. Let me try to write t as x + yi.

Let t = x + yi. Then t² = (x + yi)^2 = x² - y² + 2xyi

4i t =4i(x + yi) = -4y +4x i

So t² +4i t -7 = (x² - y² -4y -7) + (2xy +4x)i

Thus, modulus squared is (x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4(x² + y²)

So equation:

(x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4x² +4y²

Wait, this is the same equation I had earlier when substituting w = t = z -i. So seems like we end up at the same quartic equation. Maybe expanding is the way to go.

Let me try expanding the left side:

First term: (x² - y² -4y -7)^2

Let me expand this:

= (x²)^2 + (-y² -4y -7)^2 + 2x²*(-y² -4y -7)

= x^4 + (y^4 +16y² +49 +8y^3 +14y² +56y) + (-2x²y² -8x²y -14x²)

Wait, similar to before:

Wait, (-y² -4y -7)^2 = (y² +4y +7)^2 = y^4 +8y^3 + (16y² +14y²) +56y +49 = y^4 +8y^3 +30y^2 +56y +49

And the cross term is 2x²*(-y² -4y -7) = -2x²y² -8x²y -14x²

Second term: (2xy +4x)^2 =4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

So left side total:

x^4 + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -2x²y² -8x²y -14x² +4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

Combine like terms:

x^4 + [y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49] + [(-2x²y² +4x²y²) + (-8x²y +16x²y) + (-14x² +16x²)]

Simplify each group:

x^4 remains.

y terms: y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

x²y² terms: (-2 +4)x²y² =2x²y²

x²y terms: (-8 +16)x²y =8x²y

x² terms: (-14 +16)x² =2x²

So left side becomes:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

Set equal to right side 4x² +4y²:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 =4x² +4y²

Bring all terms to left side:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -4x² -4y²=0

Simplify:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y + (2x² -4x²) + y^4 +8y^3 + (30y² -4y²) +56y +49=0

Which simplifies to:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y -2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

This equation is still very complicated. Maybe factorizing or looking for possible substitutions.

Alternatively, maybe trying specific values. For example, suppose x =0. Then the equation becomes:

0 +0 +0 -0 + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

Which is y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0. Let me check if this has real roots. Hmm, possible rational roots are ±1,±7,±49. Testing y = -1:

1 -8 +26 -56 +49 =12 ≠0

y=-7: (-7)^4 +8*(-7)^3 +26*(-7)^2 +56*(-7) +49=2401 -2744 +1274 -392 +49= 2401 -2744= -343; -343 +1274=931; 931 -392=539; 539 +49=588≠0

Not zero. Maybe it factors into quadratics?

Suppose y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49 = (y² + a y + b)(y² +c y +d)

Multiply out:

y^4 + (a +c)y³ + (ac +b +d)y² + (ad + bc)y + bd

Set coefficients:

a +c=8

ac +b +d=26

ad + bc=56

bd=49

Since bd=49, possible pairs (b,d)=(7,7), (49,1), (-7,-7), etc. Let&#x27;s try positive integers first. 7 and7. Then b=7, d=7.

Then a +c=8

ac +7 +7=26 =&gt; ac=12

ad + bc=56 =&gt;7a +7c=56 =&gt;a +c=8. Which matches the first equation. So from a +c=8 and ac=12. Solving:

a and c are roots of t² -8t +12=0. Which factors as (t -6)(t -2)=0. So a=6, c=2 or a=2, c=6.

Check ad + bc: if a=6, c=2, then 7*6 +7*2=42 +14=56. Yes, works. Similarly if a=2, c=6: 7*2 +7*6=14 +42=56. So works.

Therefore, the quartic factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0

So setting x=0, the equation factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0. The roots would be y = [-6 ±sqrt(36 -28)]/2 = [-6 ±sqrt(8)]/2 = [-6 ±2√2]/2 = -3 ±√2. Similarly for the other quadratic: y = [-2 ±sqrt(4 -28)]/2. But sqrt(-24) is imaginary. So real roots are y = -3 +√2 and y = -3 -√2. But since x=0, then z =0 + yi -i = y -i. Wait, no. Wait, we set t = z -i =w, then x and y are coordinates of w. So z = w +i. If w has x=0, then z =0 + (y +1)i. So |z| = sqrt(0 + (y +1)^2) = |y +1|. The real roots for y are -3 ±√2. So |z| would be | (-3 ±√2 ) +1 | = | -2 ±√2 |. So |-2 +√2| and |-2 -√2|. Since √2≈1.414, so -2 +1.414≈-0.586, absolute value≈0.586. The other is |-2 -1.414|=3.414. So minimum |z| is approximately 0.586 when x=0. But is this the minimal overall? Because maybe when x≠0, we can get a smaller |z|.

But first, let&#x27;s check if these points are indeed solutions. If x=0 and y = -3 +√2, then w =0 + (-3 +√2)i, so z = w +i = (-3 +√2)i +i = (-2 +√2)i. Then |z| = | -2 +√2 | ≈0.586. Similarly, the other root gives |z|=3.414. So perhaps 2 -√2 is approximately0.586, which is 2 -1.414≈0.586.

But the question is whether there are other solutions with x≠0 that have smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal |z| occurs on the y-axis (x=0). Let me check that.

If x=0, then z = (0) + (y +1)i. So |z| is |y +1|. The minimal |y +1| occurs at y = -1, which gives |z|=0. But does y=-1 satisfy the equation? Let&#x27;s check.

If x=0 and y=-1, then w = z -i = (0 + (-1)i) -i = -2i. Then check |(w +2i)^2 -3| = |(-2i +2i)^2 -3| = |0 -3| =3. And 2|w| =2*| -2i | =4. 3≠4, so y=-1 is not a solution.

Wait, but when x=0, we had solutions at y= -3 ±√2. The minimal |z| for x=0 is | -2 +√2 |≈0.586. Let&#x27;s see if we can find a solution with x≠0 that has a smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal occurs at another point. Let me consider that |z| is minimal when z is closest to the origin on the curve defined by |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Maybe this curve is a circle or some conic section.

Alternatively, notice that the original equation can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Let me consider squaring both sides:

|(z +i)^2 -3|² = 4|z -i|²

Which can be written as [(z +i)^2 -3][\overline{(z +i)^2 -3}] =4(z -i)(\overline{z -i})

But this might not help unless expanded. Let me try writing z = x + yi and expanding everything again.

Alternatively, maybe notice that (z +i)^2 -3 is a quadratic in z, so the equation represents some quadratic curve. The set of points z where |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i| is likely a circle or an ellipse or hyperbola.

Alternatively, think of this as |(z +i)^2 -3| / |z -i| =2. So the ratio of distances is 2, which resembles the definition of an Apollonius circle. However, typically, Apollonius circle is |z -a| / |z -b| =k, which is a circle. But here, the numerator is |(z +i)^2 -3|, which is not a linear function, so the locus is not a circle. So maybe it&#x27;s a quartic curve.

Given that, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs at one of the points we found on the y-axis. But to confirm, perhaps consider other points.

Alternatively, parameterize the problem with z = ti where t is real. Let me try z = ti, then |z| = |t|. Let&#x27;s check if this satisfies the equation.

z = ti, so z +i = ti +i = (t +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = -(t +1)^2. Then (z +i)^2 -3 = - (t +1)^2 -3. The modulus is | - (t +1)^2 -3 | = (t +1)^2 +3.

On the other side, 2|z -i| =2| ti -i | =2| (t -1)i | =2|t -1|

So the equation becomes (t +1)^2 +3 =2|t -1|

Let me solve this equation.

Case 1: t &gt;=1. Then |t -1|=t -1.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3 =2(t -1)

Expand left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2t -2

So t² +2t +4 =2t -2

t² +6=0. No real solutions.

Case 2: t &lt;1. Then |t -1|=1 -t.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3=2(1 -t)

Left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2 -2t

So t² +2t +4 =2 -2t

t² +4t +2 =0

Solutions: t = [-4 ±sqrt(16 -8)]/2 =[-4 ±sqrt(8)]/2 =[-4 ±2√2]/2= -2 ±√2

So t = -2 +√2≈-0.585 and t=-2 -√2≈-3.414

Check if these are less than1: yes, both are.

So z =ti, so |z| =|t|. So the |z| for these solutions are |-2 +√2|≈0.586 and |-2 -√2|≈3.414. So same as before. So when z is purely imaginary, the minimal |z| is 2 -√2≈0.5857.

But is this the minimal overall? Maybe there are other points not on the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

To check, let&#x27;s suppose that minimal |z| occurs at a point not on the y-axis, so x≠0. To verify, perhaps set y such that the derivative is zero, but given the complexity of the equation, this might be difficult.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal |z| is achieved when z is colinear with the origin and the center of some circle... Wait, but the problem is that the equation is not a circle.

Alternatively, use the triangle inequality. Let me see:

We have |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

Note that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= ||(z +i)^2| -|3|| by the reverse triangle inequality. But not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, expand (z +i)^2 -3:

(z +i)^2 -3 = z² +2i z -1 -3 =z² +2i z -4

So the equation is |z² +2i z -4| =2|z -i|

Hmm, still not helpful. Let me see:

If I let z =0, then |0 +0 -4|=4, and 2|0 -i|=2*1=2. So 4≠2, so z=0 is not a solution.

If z approaches 0, then |z² +2i z -4| ≈4, and 2|z -i|≈2*1=2, so LHS &gt;RHS near z=0. So the minimal |z| must be somewhere else.

Alternatively, consider parametrizing z in terms of |z|. Let me write z = r e^{iθ}, then |z|=r. Then we need to express the equation in terms of r and θ.

But this might be complicated. Let me attempt it.

Express z = r e^{iθ}. Then z +i = r e^{iθ} +i. Let me compute (z +i)^2:

(z +i)^2 = (r e^{iθ} +i)^2 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -1

Therefore, (z +i)^2 -3 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4

So modulus squared is |r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4|² = [r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2

And the right side is 2|z -i| =2| r e^{iθ} -i | =2 sqrt(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

So squaring both sides:

[r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2 =4(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

This equation relates r and θ. To find the minimal r, we can try to analyze this equation.

This looks very involved, but perhaps consider specific angles θ where the equation simplifies.

For instance, let me consider θ = -π/2, which would align z along the negative imaginary axis. Then z = -r i.

Compute left side:

[r² cos(-π) -4]^2 + [r² sin(-π) +2r cos(-π/2)]^2

= [r²*(-1) -4]^2 + [0 +2r*0]^2

= (-r² -4)^2 +0 = (r² +4)^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r*(-1))=4(r² +1 +2r)=4r² +4 +8r

Set equal:

(r² +4)^2 =4r² +8r +4

Expand left: r^4 +8r² +16

So equation: r^4 +8r² +16 =4r² +8r +4

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +4r² -8r +12=0

Not sure if this factors. Testing r=1:1 +4 -8 +12=9≠0

r=2:16 +16 -16 +12=28≠0

No obvious roots. So θ=-π/2 might not yield solutions.

Alternatively, take θ=0, so z is real positive. Then z =r.

Left side:

[r² cos0 -4]^2 +[r² sin0 +2r cos0]^2

= (r² -4)^2 + (0 +2r)^2 = (r² -4)^2 +4r²

Right side:

4(r² +1 -0)=4r² +4

Set equal:

(r² -4)^2 +4r² =4r² +4

Simplify: (r² -4)^2 =4

Take sqrt: r² -4=±2

Case1: r² -4=2 =&gt;r²=6 =&gt;r=√6≈2.449

Case2: r² -4=-2 =&gt;r²=2 =&gt;r=√2≈1.414

So θ=0, solutions at r=√2 and r=√6. So |z|=√2≈1.414 and √6≈2.449. But earlier, on the imaginary axis, we had |z|=2 -√2≈0.586, which is smaller. So these are not minimal.

Alternatively, check θ=π/2, z=ri, but already considered that case.

Alternatively, suppose θ=π/4. Then z = r e^{iπ/4}= r(√2/2 +i√2/2)

Compute left side:

[r² cos(π/2) -4]^2 + [r² sin(π/2) +2r cos(π/4)]^2

= [0 -4]^2 + [r²*1 +2r*(√2/2)]^2

=16 + [r² +√2 r]^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r sin(π/4))=4(r² +1 -2r*(√2/2))=4(r² +1 -√2 r)

Set equal:

16 + (r² +√2 r)^2 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Expand left:

16 +r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r²

Equation:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r² +16 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 -2r² +4√2 r +12=0

This seems difficult to solve. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis, as previously found. To confirm, maybe check another angle.

Alternatively, notice that when we substituted z =ti (i.e., x=0), we found solutions with |z|=2 -√2 and 2 +√2. The smaller one is 2 -√2≈0.5858.

But we need to check if there are any other solutions off the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

Suppose there exists a point z with |z| &lt;2 -√2. Let me assume such a point exists and see if it leads to a contradiction.

Let |z|=r &lt;2 -√2≈0.5858.

But since |z -i| &gt;= | |z| - |i| | = |r -1|. So 2|z -i| &gt;=2(1 -r)

On the other hand, |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= |(z +i)^2| +| -3| = |z +i|² +3. Since |z +i| &lt;=|z| +|i|=r +1. So |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

But we have equality |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So if 2(1 -r) &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

Let me check if this holds for r &lt;2 -√2.

Compute RHS - LHS = (r +1)^2 +3 -2(1 -r)=r² +2r +1 +3 -2 +2r=r² +4r +2

Which is positive for all real r. So this inequality holds for any r, but that doesn&#x27;t give us a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps using other inequalities. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= | |(z +i)^2| - |3| |. Which is | |z +i|² -3 |.

So we have | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;= |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;=2|z -i|

But not sure how helpful this is.

Alternatively, let me assume that the minimal |z| occurs at the point we found on the imaginary axis, 2 -√2≈0.586, and check if there can be any other points with smaller |z|.

Alternatively, note that the equation |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i| can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3|² =4|z -i|², which is the equation we derived earlier. If we assume that the minimal |z| occurs at a point where the gradient is colinear with the position vector, i.e., the point where the curve is tangent to the circle centered at the origin. But calculating this would require using Lagrange multipliers, which is quite involved given the complexity of the equation.

Alternatively, given the earlier solutions on the imaginary axis and given that when minimizing |z|, the closest point might lie on the imaginary axis due to symmetry. Since the equation involves z +i and z -i, which are vertical translations, it&#x27;s possible that the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal value we found is 2 -√2≈0.5858, and since we couldn&#x27;t find any solution with smaller |z|, and given the symmetry, this might be the minimal value.

Therefore, I think the minimal |z| is 2 -√2, achieved when z is on the imaginary axis at z=(-2 +√2)i, so |z|=| -2 +√2 | =2 -√2.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the minimum value of \(|z|\) for complex numbers \(z\) satisfying the equation \(|(z + i)^2 - 3| = 2|z - i|\), we start by substituting \(z = w + i\) where \(w = z - i\). This transforms the equation into \(|(w + 2i)^2 - 3| = 2|w|\).

We then consider \(w = x + yi\) and substitute into the equation. After expanding and simplifying both sides, we find that the equation becomes complex. However, by considering specific cases where \(w\) is purely imaginary (i.e., \(x = 0\)), we simplify the problem.

Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation, we solve for \(y\) and find the roots \(y = -3 \pm \sqrt{2}\). Translating back to \(z\), we get \(z = (-2 + \sqrt{2})i\) and \(z = (-2 - \sqrt{2})i\). The modulus \(|z|\) for these points is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} |\) and \(| -2 - \sqrt{2} |\), respectively.

The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} | = 2 - \sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).          </p>

Problem: Find the minimum value of \(|z|\) for complex numbers \(z\) satisfying the equation \(|(z+i)^2-3| = 2|z-i|\). Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: We can factor the LHS and apply the triangle inequality: \[|(z+i)^2-3| = 2|z-i| \implies (z+i)^2-3 = 2|z-i|\implies (z+i+1)(z+i-1) = 2|z-i|.\] The RHS is positive and so the product term \( (z+i+1)(z+i-1)\) must be negative. We can take squares to get characteristic polynomial, \[z^2+(i+1)z+(i+1)z-(3+2i)=-z^2-(i+1)z+3i+2i,\] which has roots \[z= \frac{(i-1)\pm\sqrt{i^2 + i + 1}-i+1}{2}\] To minimize \(|z|\), take the maximal root; this is \[\boxed{\sqrt{i + 1} &gt; i \implies 2 \sqrt{2} &gt; \sqrt{2}},\] which holds by the usual rules for inequalities.          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The question is asking for the minimum value of |z| where z is a complex number that satisfies the equation |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Hmm, complex numbers and modulus... I remember that complex numbers can be represented in the complex plane, so maybe I can translate this equation into geometric terms?

First, let me recall that for a complex number z = x + yi, |z| is the modulus, which is √(x² + y²). So |z| represents the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) in the plane. The problem wants the minimum such distance among all z that satisfy the given equation.

The equation given is |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Let me try to break this down. Let&#x27;s substitute z = x + yi into the equation. Then z + i = x + (y + 1)i. Squaring that gives (x + (y + 1)i)². Let me compute that:

(x + (y + 1)i)² = x² + 2x(y + 1)i + [(y + 1)i]²
= x² + 2x(y + 1)i - (y + 1)²
= (x² - (y + 1)²) + 2x(y + 1)i

So (z + i)² - 3 would be [(x² - (y + 1)²) - 3] + 2x(y + 1)i. Then the modulus of this is equal to 2|z - i|. Let&#x27;s compute both sides.

Left side modulus: sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side: 2|z - i| = 2| x + (y - 1)i | = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

So, the equation becomes:

sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²] = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

Hmm, that looks complicated. Maybe squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots would help. Let me try that.

Left side squared: [(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side squared: 4(x² + (y - 1)²)

So expanding the left side:

First, let me denote A = x² - (y + 1)² - 3, and B = 2x(y + 1). Then the left side squared is A² + B².

Compute A²:

[x² - (y + 1)² - 3]^2

Let me expand (y + 1)² first: y² + 2y + 1. So x² - (y² + 2y + 1) - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 1 - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 4.

Therefore, A = x² - y² - 2y - 4, so A² = (x² - y² - 2y - 4)²

Similarly, B = 2x(y + 1), so B² = 4x²(y + 1)²

So left side squared becomes:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4(x² + (y - 1)^2)

Let me expand the right side:

4(x² + y² - 2y + 1) = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

So now, the equation is:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

Hmm, this seems really messy. Maybe there&#x27;s a better way to approach this problem instead of expanding everything. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let w = z - i. Then z = w + i. Let me substitute that into the original equation.

So, |(w + i + i)² - 3| = 2|w + i - i| =&gt; |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

Maybe this substitution simplifies things. Let&#x27;s denote w = a + bi. Then w + 2i = a + (b + 2)i. Then (w + 2i)² is [a + (b + 2)i]² = a² + 2a(b + 2)i + [(b + 2)i]^2 = a² + 2a(b + 2)i - (b + 2)^2

So (w + 2i)^2 - 3 = [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3] + 2a(b + 2)i

Then the modulus squared is [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4|w|^2 = 4(a² + b²)

So expanding the left side:

[a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4(a² + b²)

Let me compute [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2. First, expand (b + 2)^2: b² + 4b + 4. So a² - b² -4b -4 -3 = a² - b² -4b -7. So the first term is (a² - b² -4b -7)^2.

Second term: [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4a²(b + 2)^2

So left side becomes:

(a² - b² -4b -7)^2 + 4a²(b + 2)^2 = 4a² + 4b²

This still seems complicated, but maybe expanding the left side will lead to some cancellation.

First, let&#x27;s expand (a² - b² -4b -7)^2:

= (a²)^2 + (-b² -4b -7)^2 + 2a²(-b² -4b -7)

= a^4 + (b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b² + 56b) + (-2a²b² -8a²b -14a²)

Wait, that&#x27;s a bit messy. Let me do it step by step.

Let me denote C = a² and D = -b² -4b -7. Then (C + D)^2 = C² + 2CD + D².

C² = (a²)^2 = a^4

2CD = 2a²(-b² -4b -7) = -2a²b² -8a²b -14a²

D² = (-b² -4b -7)^2. Let&#x27;s compute that:

= (b² +4b +7)^2

= (b²)^2 + (4b)^2 + (7)^2 + 2*b²*4b + 2*b²*7 + 2*4b*7

= b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b^2 + 56b

= b^4 + 8b^3 + (16b^2 +14b^2) +56b +49

= b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So D² = b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So putting it all together, (a² - b² -4b -7)^2 = a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, adding the second term: 4a²(b + 2)^2

First compute (b + 2)^2 = b² +4b +4. Then 4a²*(b² +4b +4) = 4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

So the entire left side becomes:

a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 +4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

a^4: a^4

a²b² terms: -2a²b² +4a²b² = 2a²b²

a²b terms: -8a²b +16a²b = 8a²b

a² terms: -14a² +16a² = 2a²

b^4: b^4

b^3:8b^3

b^2:30b^2

b terms:56b

constants:49

So left side simplifies to:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, the right side is 4a² +4b²

Therefore, the equation is:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 = 4a² +4b²

Bringing all terms to the left side:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 -4a² -4b² =0

Simplify:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b + (2a² -4a²) + b^4 +8b^3 + (30b^2 -4b^2) +56b +49 =0

Which simplifies to:

a^4 +2a²b² +8a²b -2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +26b^2 +56b +49=0

Hmm, this still looks quite complicated. Maybe there&#x27;s a different approach here. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z - i|

Perhaps instead of substituting z = x + yi, I can interpret this geometrically. Let me recall that for complex numbers, |A - B| represents the distance between points A and B in the complex plane.

But here, the equation is |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Hmm, that&#x27;s not a straightforward distance. Alternatively, maybe I can see (z + i)^2 as some transformation of z. Squaring a complex number can be seen as a geometric transformation: squaring the modulus and doubling the angle. But I&#x27;m not sure how that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe set w = z + i, so z = w - i. Then the equation becomes |w² - 3| = 2|w - 2i|

But maybe this substitution can help. Let me check:

Original substitution: z = w - i, so z + i = w, and z - i = w - 2i. Then the equation |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

So we have |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Maybe this is easier to handle. Let me denote w = a + bi. Then w² = (a + bi)^2 = a² - b² + 2abi. Then w² - 3 = (a² - b² -3) + 2abi. The modulus of this is sqrt[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] and the right side is 2*sqrt[a² + (b - 2)^2]. Then squaring both sides:

[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] = 4[a² + (b -2)^2]

But this seems similar to the previous approach. Maybe expanding this will lead to the same equation.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a parametrization or polar coordinates. Let me try that. Let me set w = r e^{iθ}, where r = |w|, θ is the argument.

Then |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Expressing in polar coordinates:

|r² e^{i2θ} -3| = 2 | r e^{iθ} - 2i|

But this might not lead to an easy equation either. Let me compute both sides.

Left side modulus: |r² e^{i2θ} -3|. This is the distance from the point (r² cos 2θ, r² sin 2θ) to (3, 0).

Right side: 2|r e^{iθ} - 2i| = 2| (r cos θ) + i(r sin θ - 2)| = 2 sqrt[ (r cos θ)^2 + (r sin θ -2)^2 ]

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps consider specific points. For example, if z is real, then z = x, so y =0. Then compute if that satisfies the equation.

But maybe that&#x27;s too restrictive. The minimum |z| might not occur on the real axis. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus. Let me consider that |z| is the distance from the origin, and we need to minimize this distance subject to the constraint |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. So this is an optimization problem with a constraint. Maybe Lagrange multipliers?

Yes, that&#x27;s a possible approach. Let me try that.

Let me denote z = x + yi. Then |z| = sqrt(x² + y²). We need to minimize x² + y² (since sqrt is increasing, minimizing sqrt(x² + y²) is equivalent to minimizing x² + y²).

The constraint is |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0. Let me denote f(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

So using Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of the objective function and the constraint should be proportional.

The objective function is F(x, y) = x² + y².

The constraint is G(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

Compute ∇F = [2x, 2y]

Compute ∇G. This is a bit involved, but let&#x27;s recall that for a function G(x,y) = |A(x, y)| - |B(x, y)|, the gradient is (∇|A| - ∇|B|). So need to compute gradients of |(z +i)^2 -3| and 2|z -i|.

Let me first compute |(z +i)^2 -3|.

Let me denote A = (z +i)^2 -3. Then |A| is modulus of A.

Express A in terms of x and y. As earlier, z = x + yi, so z +i = x + (y +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = x² - (y +1)^2 + 2x(y +1)i. Then subtract 3: [x² - (y +1)^2 -3] + 2x(y +1)i. So A = u + vi where u = x² - (y +1)^2 -3 and v = 2x(y +1).

Thus, |A| = sqrt(u² + v²). The gradient of |A| is ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) )

Similarly, |B| where B = z -i = x + (y -1)i, so |B| = sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2). The gradient of |B| is (x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2), (y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2))

Therefore, gradient of G = ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*(x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*((y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)) )

This seems very complicated, but maybe at the minimal point, there is some symmetry or simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps parameterizing the problem. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|

Let me let z -i = w. Then z = w + i. Then z + i = w + 2i. So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)^2 -3| = 2|w|

So |w² +4i w -4 -3| =2|w|, since (w + 2i)^2 = w² +4i w + (2i)^2 = w² +4i w -4. Then subtract 3: w² +4i w -7.

Thus, |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|

Hmm, maybe if I write this as |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|, perhaps dividing both sides by |w| (assuming w ≠0):

| w +4i -7/w | =2

But not sure if this helps. Let me check:

If w ≠0, then divide both sides by |w|:

| (w² +4i w -7)/w | =2 =&gt; |w +4i -7/w| =2

But this might not necessarily help. Alternatively, set t = w, then |t² +4i t -7| =2|t|. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |t² +4i t -7|² =4|t|²

So (t² +4i t -7)(\overline{t² +4i t -7}) =4|t|²

But this is getting too algebraic. Let me try to write t as x + yi.

Let t = x + yi. Then t² = (x + yi)^2 = x² - y² + 2xyi

4i t =4i(x + yi) = -4y +4x i

So t² +4i t -7 = (x² - y² -4y -7) + (2xy +4x)i

Thus, modulus squared is (x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4(x² + y²)

So equation:

(x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4x² +4y²

Wait, this is the same equation I had earlier when substituting w = t = z -i. So seems like we end up at the same quartic equation. Maybe expanding is the way to go.

Let me try expanding the left side:

First term: (x² - y² -4y -7)^2

Let me expand this:

= (x²)^2 + (-y² -4y -7)^2 + 2x²*(-y² -4y -7)

= x^4 + (y^4 +16y² +49 +8y^3 +14y² +56y) + (-2x²y² -8x²y -14x²)

Wait, similar to before:

Wait, (-y² -4y -7)^2 = (y² +4y +7)^2 = y^4 +8y^3 + (16y² +14y²) +56y +49 = y^4 +8y^3 +30y^2 +56y +49

And the cross term is 2x²*(-y² -4y -7) = -2x²y² -8x²y -14x²

Second term: (2xy +4x)^2 =4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

So left side total:

x^4 + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -2x²y² -8x²y -14x² +4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

Combine like terms:

x^4 + [y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49] + [(-2x²y² +4x²y²) + (-8x²y +16x²y) + (-14x² +16x²)]

Simplify each group:

x^4 remains.

y terms: y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

x²y² terms: (-2 +4)x²y² =2x²y²

x²y terms: (-8 +16)x²y =8x²y

x² terms: (-14 +16)x² =2x²

So left side becomes:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

Set equal to right side 4x² +4y²:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 =4x² +4y²

Bring all terms to left side:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -4x² -4y²=0

Simplify:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y + (2x² -4x²) + y^4 +8y^3 + (30y² -4y²) +56y +49=0

Which simplifies to:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y -2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

This equation is still very complicated. Maybe factorizing or looking for possible substitutions.

Alternatively, maybe trying specific values. For example, suppose x =0. Then the equation becomes:

0 +0 +0 -0 + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

Which is y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0. Let me check if this has real roots. Hmm, possible rational roots are ±1,±7,±49. Testing y = -1:

1 -8 +26 -56 +49 =12 ≠0

y=-7: (-7)^4 +8*(-7)^3 +26*(-7)^2 +56*(-7) +49=2401 -2744 +1274 -392 +49= 2401 -2744= -343; -343 +1274=931; 931 -392=539; 539 +49=588≠0

Not zero. Maybe it factors into quadratics?

Suppose y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49 = (y² + a y + b)(y² +c y +d)

Multiply out:

y^4 + (a +c)y³ + (ac +b +d)y² + (ad + bc)y + bd

Set coefficients:

a +c=8

ac +b +d=26

ad + bc=56

bd=49

Since bd=49, possible pairs (b,d)=(7,7), (49,1), (-7,-7), etc. Let&#x27;s try positive integers first. 7 and7. Then b=7, d=7.

Then a +c=8

ac +7 +7=26 =&gt; ac=12

ad + bc=56 =&gt;7a +7c=56 =&gt;a +c=8. Which matches the first equation. So from a +c=8 and ac=12. Solving:

a and c are roots of t² -8t +12=0. Which factors as (t -6)(t -2)=0. So a=6, c=2 or a=2, c=6.

Check ad + bc: if a=6, c=2, then 7*6 +7*2=42 +14=56. Yes, works. Similarly if a=2, c=6: 7*2 +7*6=14 +42=56. So works.

Therefore, the quartic factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0

So setting x=0, the equation factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0. The roots would be y = [-6 ±sqrt(36 -28)]/2 = [-6 ±sqrt(8)]/2 = [-6 ±2√2]/2 = -3 ±√2. Similarly for the other quadratic: y = [-2 ±sqrt(4 -28)]/2. But sqrt(-24) is imaginary. So real roots are y = -3 +√2 and y = -3 -√2. But since x=0, then z =0 + yi -i = y -i. Wait, no. Wait, we set t = z -i =w, then x and y are coordinates of w. So z = w +i. If w has x=0, then z =0 + (y +1)i. So |z| = sqrt(0 + (y +1)^2) = |y +1|. The real roots for y are -3 ±√2. So |z| would be | (-3 ±√2 ) +1 | = | -2 ±√2 |. So |-2 +√2| and |-2 -√2|. Since √2≈1.414, so -2 +1.414≈-0.586, absolute value≈0.586. The other is |-2 -1.414|=3.414. So minimum |z| is approximately 0.586 when x=0. But is this the minimal overall? Because maybe when x≠0, we can get a smaller |z|.

But first, let&#x27;s check if these points are indeed solutions. If x=0 and y = -3 +√2, then w =0 + (-3 +√2)i, so z = w +i = (-3 +√2)i +i = (-2 +√2)i. Then |z| = | -2 +√2 | ≈0.586. Similarly, the other root gives |z|=3.414. So perhaps 2 -√2 is approximately0.586, which is 2 -1.414≈0.586.

But the question is whether there are other solutions with x≠0 that have smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal |z| occurs on the y-axis (x=0). Let me check that.

If x=0, then z = (0) + (y +1)i. So |z| is |y +1|. The minimal |y +1| occurs at y = -1, which gives |z|=0. But does y=-1 satisfy the equation? Let&#x27;s check.

If x=0 and y=-1, then w = z -i = (0 + (-1)i) -i = -2i. Then check |(w +2i)^2 -3| = |(-2i +2i)^2 -3| = |0 -3| =3. And 2|w| =2*| -2i | =4. 3≠4, so y=-1 is not a solution.

Wait, but when x=0, we had solutions at y= -3 ±√2. The minimal |z| for x=0 is | -2 +√2 |≈0.586. Let&#x27;s see if we can find a solution with x≠0 that has a smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal occurs at another point. Let me consider that |z| is minimal when z is closest to the origin on the curve defined by |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Maybe this curve is a circle or some conic section.

Alternatively, notice that the original equation can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Let me consider squaring both sides:

|(z +i)^2 -3|² = 4|z -i|²

Which can be written as [(z +i)^2 -3][\overline{(z +i)^2 -3}] =4(z -i)(\overline{z -i})

But this might not help unless expanded. Let me try writing z = x + yi and expanding everything again.

Alternatively, maybe notice that (z +i)^2 -3 is a quadratic in z, so the equation represents some quadratic curve. The set of points z where |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i| is likely a circle or an ellipse or hyperbola.

Alternatively, think of this as |(z +i)^2 -3| / |z -i| =2. So the ratio of distances is 2, which resembles the definition of an Apollonius circle. However, typically, Apollonius circle is |z -a| / |z -b| =k, which is a circle. But here, the numerator is |(z +i)^2 -3|, which is not a linear function, so the locus is not a circle. So maybe it&#x27;s a quartic curve.

Given that, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs at one of the points we found on the y-axis. But to confirm, perhaps consider other points.

Alternatively, parameterize the problem with z = ti where t is real. Let me try z = ti, then |z| = |t|. Let&#x27;s check if this satisfies the equation.

z = ti, so z +i = ti +i = (t +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = -(t +1)^2. Then (z +i)^2 -3 = - (t +1)^2 -3. The modulus is | - (t +1)^2 -3 | = (t +1)^2 +3.

On the other side, 2|z -i| =2| ti -i | =2| (t -1)i | =2|t -1|

So the equation becomes (t +1)^2 +3 =2|t -1|

Let me solve this equation.

Case 1: t &gt;=1. Then |t -1|=t -1.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3 =2(t -1)

Expand left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2t -2

So t² +2t +4 =2t -2

t² +6=0. No real solutions.

Case 2: t &lt;1. Then |t -1|=1 -t.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3=2(1 -t)

Left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2 -2t

So t² +2t +4 =2 -2t

t² +4t +2 =0

Solutions: t = [-4 ±sqrt(16 -8)]/2 =[-4 ±sqrt(8)]/2 =[-4 ±2√2]/2= -2 ±√2

So t = -2 +√2≈-0.585 and t=-2 -√2≈-3.414

Check if these are less than1: yes, both are.

So z =ti, so |z| =|t|. So the |z| for these solutions are |-2 +√2|≈0.586 and |-2 -√2|≈3.414. So same as before. So when z is purely imaginary, the minimal |z| is 2 -√2≈0.5857.

But is this the minimal overall? Maybe there are other points not on the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

To check, let&#x27;s suppose that minimal |z| occurs at a point not on the y-axis, so x≠0. To verify, perhaps set y such that the derivative is zero, but given the complexity of the equation, this might be difficult.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal |z| is achieved when z is colinear with the origin and the center of some circle... Wait, but the problem is that the equation is not a circle.

Alternatively, use the triangle inequality. Let me see:

We have |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

Note that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= ||(z +i)^2| -|3|| by the reverse triangle inequality. But not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, expand (z +i)^2 -3:

(z +i)^2 -3 = z² +2i z -1 -3 =z² +2i z -4

So the equation is |z² +2i z -4| =2|z -i|

Hmm, still not helpful. Let me see:

If I let z =0, then |0 +0 -4|=4, and 2|0 -i|=2*1=2. So 4≠2, so z=0 is not a solution.

If z approaches 0, then |z² +2i z -4| ≈4, and 2|z -i|≈2*1=2, so LHS &gt;RHS near z=0. So the minimal |z| must be somewhere else.

Alternatively, consider parametrizing z in terms of |z|. Let me write z = r e^{iθ}, then |z|=r. Then we need to express the equation in terms of r and θ.

But this might be complicated. Let me attempt it.

Express z = r e^{iθ}. Then z +i = r e^{iθ} +i. Let me compute (z +i)^2:

(z +i)^2 = (r e^{iθ} +i)^2 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -1

Therefore, (z +i)^2 -3 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4

So modulus squared is |r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4|² = [r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2

And the right side is 2|z -i| =2| r e^{iθ} -i | =2 sqrt(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

So squaring both sides:

[r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2 =4(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

This equation relates r and θ. To find the minimal r, we can try to analyze this equation.

This looks very involved, but perhaps consider specific angles θ where the equation simplifies.

For instance, let me consider θ = -π/2, which would align z along the negative imaginary axis. Then z = -r i.

Compute left side:

[r² cos(-π) -4]^2 + [r² sin(-π) +2r cos(-π/2)]^2

= [r²*(-1) -4]^2 + [0 +2r*0]^2

= (-r² -4)^2 +0 = (r² +4)^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r*(-1))=4(r² +1 +2r)=4r² +4 +8r

Set equal:

(r² +4)^2 =4r² +8r +4

Expand left: r^4 +8r² +16

So equation: r^4 +8r² +16 =4r² +8r +4

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +4r² -8r +12=0

Not sure if this factors. Testing r=1:1 +4 -8 +12=9≠0

r=2:16 +16 -16 +12=28≠0

No obvious roots. So θ=-π/2 might not yield solutions.

Alternatively, take θ=0, so z is real positive. Then z =r.

Left side:

[r² cos0 -4]^2 +[r² sin0 +2r cos0]^2

= (r² -4)^2 + (0 +2r)^2 = (r² -4)^2 +4r²

Right side:

4(r² +1 -0)=4r² +4

Set equal:

(r² -4)^2 +4r² =4r² +4

Simplify: (r² -4)^2 =4

Take sqrt: r² -4=±2

Case1: r² -4=2 =&gt;r²=6 =&gt;r=√6≈2.449

Case2: r² -4=-2 =&gt;r²=2 =&gt;r=√2≈1.414

So θ=0, solutions at r=√2 and r=√6. So |z|=√2≈1.414 and √6≈2.449. But earlier, on the imaginary axis, we had |z|=2 -√2≈0.586, which is smaller. So these are not minimal.

Alternatively, check θ=π/2, z=ri, but already considered that case.

Alternatively, suppose θ=π/4. Then z = r e^{iπ/4}= r(√2/2 +i√2/2)

Compute left side:

[r² cos(π/2) -4]^2 + [r² sin(π/2) +2r cos(π/4)]^2

= [0 -4]^2 + [r²*1 +2r*(√2/2)]^2

=16 + [r² +√2 r]^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r sin(π/4))=4(r² +1 -2r*(√2/2))=4(r² +1 -√2 r)

Set equal:

16 + (r² +√2 r)^2 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Expand left:

16 +r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r²

Equation:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r² +16 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 -2r² +4√2 r +12=0

This seems difficult to solve. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis, as previously found. To confirm, maybe check another angle.

Alternatively, notice that when we substituted z =ti (i.e., x=0), we found solutions with |z|=2 -√2 and 2 +√2. The smaller one is 2 -√2≈0.5858.

But we need to check if there are any other solutions off the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

Suppose there exists a point z with |z| &lt;2 -√2. Let me assume such a point exists and see if it leads to a contradiction.

Let |z|=r &lt;2 -√2≈0.5858.

But since |z -i| &gt;= | |z| - |i| | = |r -1|. So 2|z -i| &gt;=2(1 -r)

On the other hand, |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= |(z +i)^2| +| -3| = |z +i|² +3. Since |z +i| &lt;=|z| +|i|=r +1. So |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

But we have equality |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So if 2(1 -r) &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

Let me check if this holds for r &lt;2 -√2.

Compute RHS - LHS = (r +1)^2 +3 -2(1 -r)=r² +2r +1 +3 -2 +2r=r² +4r +2

Which is positive for all real r. So this inequality holds for any r, but that doesn&#x27;t give us a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps using other inequalities. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= | |(z +i)^2| - |3| |. Which is | |z +i|² -3 |.

So we have | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;= |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;=2|z -i|

But not sure how helpful this is.

Alternatively, let me assume that the minimal |z| occurs at the point we found on the imaginary axis, 2 -√2≈0.586, and check if there can be any other points with smaller |z|.

Alternatively, note that the equation |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i| can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3|² =4|z -i|², which is the equation we derived earlier. If we assume that the minimal |z| occurs at a point where the gradient is colinear with the position vector, i.e., the point where the curve is tangent to the circle centered at the origin. But calculating this would require using Lagrange multipliers, which is quite involved given the complexity of the equation.

Alternatively, given the earlier solutions on the imaginary axis and given that when minimizing |z|, the closest point might lie on the imaginary axis due to symmetry. Since the equation involves z +i and z -i, which are vertical translations, it&#x27;s possible that the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal value we found is 2 -√2≈0.5858, and since we couldn&#x27;t find any solution with smaller |z|, and given the symmetry, this might be the minimal value.

Therefore, I think the minimal |z| is 2 -√2, achieved when z is on the imaginary axis at z=(-2 +√2)i, so |z|=| -2 +√2 | =2 -√2.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the minimum value of \(|z|\) for complex numbers \(z\) satisfying the equation \(|(z + i)^2 - 3| = 2|z - i|\), we start by substituting \(z = w + i\) where \(w = z - i\). This transforms the equation into \(|(w + 2i)^2 - 3| = 2|w|\).

We then consider \(w = x + yi\) and substitute into the equation. After expanding and simplifying both sides, we find that the equation becomes complex. However, by considering specific cases where \(w\) is purely imaginary (i.e., \(x = 0\)), we simplify the problem.

Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation, we solve for \(y\) and find the roots \(y = -3 \pm \sqrt{2}\). Translating back to \(z\), we get \(z = (-2 + \sqrt{2})i\) and \(z = (-2 - \sqrt{2})i\). The modulus \(|z|\) for these points is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} |\) and \(| -2 - \sqrt{2} |\), respectively.

The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} | = 2 - \sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The question is asking for the minimum value of |z| where z is a complex number that satisfies the equation |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Hmm, complex numbers and modulus... I remember that complex numbers can be represented in the complex plane, so maybe I can translate this equation into geometric terms?

First, let me recall that for a complex number z = x + yi, |z| is the modulus, which is √(x² + y²). So |z| represents the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) in the plane. The problem wants the minimum such distance among all z that satisfy the given equation.

The equation given is |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Let me try to break this down. Let&#x27;s substitute z = x + yi into the equation. Then z + i = x + (y + 1)i. Squaring that gives (x + (y + 1)i)². Let me compute that:

(x + (y + 1)i)² = x² + 2x(y + 1)i + [(y + 1)i]²
= x² + 2x(y + 1)i - (y + 1)²
= (x² - (y + 1)²) + 2x(y + 1)i

So (z + i)² - 3 would be [(x² - (y + 1)²) - 3] + 2x(y + 1)i. Then the modulus of this is equal to 2|z - i|. Let&#x27;s compute both sides.

Left side modulus: sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side: 2|z - i| = 2| x + (y - 1)i | = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

So, the equation becomes:

sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²] = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

Hmm, that looks complicated. Maybe squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots would help. Let me try that.

Left side squared: [(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side squared: 4(x² + (y - 1)²)

So expanding the left side:

First, let me denote A = x² - (y + 1)² - 3, and B = 2x(y + 1). Then the left side squared is A² + B².

Compute A²:

[x² - (y + 1)² - 3]^2

Let me expand (y + 1)² first: y² + 2y + 1. So x² - (y² + 2y + 1) - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 1 - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 4.

Therefore, A = x² - y² - 2y - 4, so A² = (x² - y² - 2y - 4)²

Similarly, B = 2x(y + 1), so B² = 4x²(y + 1)²

So left side squared becomes:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4(x² + (y - 1)^2)

Let me expand the right side:

4(x² + y² - 2y + 1) = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

So now, the equation is:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

Hmm, this seems really messy. Maybe there&#x27;s a better way to approach this problem instead of expanding everything. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let w = z - i. Then z = w + i. Let me substitute that into the original equation.

So, |(w + i + i)² - 3| = 2|w + i - i| =&gt; |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

Maybe this substitution simplifies things. Let&#x27;s denote w = a + bi. Then w + 2i = a + (b + 2)i. Then (w + 2i)² is [a + (b + 2)i]² = a² + 2a(b + 2)i + [(b + 2)i]^2 = a² + 2a(b + 2)i - (b + 2)^2

So (w + 2i)^2 - 3 = [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3] + 2a(b + 2)i

Then the modulus squared is [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4|w|^2 = 4(a² + b²)

So expanding the left side:

[a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4(a² + b²)

Let me compute [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2. First, expand (b + 2)^2: b² + 4b + 4. So a² - b² -4b -4 -3 = a² - b² -4b -7. So the first term is (a² - b² -4b -7)^2.

Second term: [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4a²(b + 2)^2

So left side becomes:

(a² - b² -4b -7)^2 + 4a²(b + 2)^2 = 4a² + 4b²

This still seems complicated, but maybe expanding the left side will lead to some cancellation.

First, let&#x27;s expand (a² - b² -4b -7)^2:

= (a²)^2 + (-b² -4b -7)^2 + 2a²(-b² -4b -7)

= a^4 + (b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b² + 56b) + (-2a²b² -8a²b -14a²)

Wait, that&#x27;s a bit messy. Let me do it step by step.

Let me denote C = a² and D = -b² -4b -7. Then (C + D)^2 = C² + 2CD + D².

C² = (a²)^2 = a^4

2CD = 2a²(-b² -4b -7) = -2a²b² -8a²b -14a²

D² = (-b² -4b -7)^2. Let&#x27;s compute that:

= (b² +4b +7)^2

= (b²)^2 + (4b)^2 + (7)^2 + 2*b²*4b + 2*b²*7 + 2*4b*7

= b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b^2 + 56b

= b^4 + 8b^3 + (16b^2 +14b^2) +56b +49

= b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So D² = b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So putting it all together, (a² - b² -4b -7)^2 = a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, adding the second term: 4a²(b + 2)^2

First compute (b + 2)^2 = b² +4b +4. Then 4a²*(b² +4b +4) = 4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

So the entire left side becomes:

a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 +4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

a^4: a^4

a²b² terms: -2a²b² +4a²b² = 2a²b²

a²b terms: -8a²b +16a²b = 8a²b

a² terms: -14a² +16a² = 2a²

b^4: b^4

b^3:8b^3

b^2:30b^2

b terms:56b

constants:49

So left side simplifies to:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, the right side is 4a² +4b²

Therefore, the equation is:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 = 4a² +4b²

Bringing all terms to the left side:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 -4a² -4b² =0

Simplify:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b + (2a² -4a²) + b^4 +8b^3 + (30b^2 -4b^2) +56b +49 =0

Which simplifies to:

a^4 +2a²b² +8a²b -2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +26b^2 +56b +49=0

Hmm, this still looks quite complicated. Maybe there&#x27;s a different approach here. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z - i|

Perhaps instead of substituting z = x + yi, I can interpret this geometrically. Let me recall that for complex numbers, |A - B| represents the distance between points A and B in the complex plane.

But here, the equation is |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Hmm, that&#x27;s not a straightforward distance. Alternatively, maybe I can see (z + i)^2 as some transformation of z. Squaring a complex number can be seen as a geometric transformation: squaring the modulus and doubling the angle. But I&#x27;m not sure how that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe set w = z + i, so z = w - i. Then the equation becomes |w² - 3| = 2|w - 2i|

But maybe this substitution can help. Let me check:

Original substitution: z = w - i, so z + i = w, and z - i = w - 2i. Then the equation |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

So we have |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Maybe this is easier to handle. Let me denote w = a + bi. Then w² = (a + bi)^2 = a² - b² + 2abi. Then w² - 3 = (a² - b² -3) + 2abi. The modulus of this is sqrt[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] and the right side is 2*sqrt[a² + (b - 2)^2]. Then squaring both sides:

[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] = 4[a² + (b -2)^2]

But this seems similar to the previous approach. Maybe expanding this will lead to the same equation.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a parametrization or polar coordinates. Let me try that. Let me set w = r e^{iθ}, where r = |w|, θ is the argument.

Then |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Expressing in polar coordinates:

|r² e^{i2θ} -3| = 2 | r e^{iθ} - 2i|

But this might not lead to an easy equation either. Let me compute both sides.

Left side modulus: |r² e^{i2θ} -3|. This is the distance from the point (r² cos 2θ, r² sin 2θ) to (3, 0).

Right side: 2|r e^{iθ} - 2i| = 2| (r cos θ) + i(r sin θ - 2)| = 2 sqrt[ (r cos θ)^2 + (r sin θ -2)^2 ]

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps consider specific points. For example, if z is real, then z = x, so y =0. Then compute if that satisfies the equation.

But maybe that&#x27;s too restrictive. The minimum |z| might not occur on the real axis. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus. Let me consider that |z| is the distance from the origin, and we need to minimize this distance subject to the constraint |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. So this is an optimization problem with a constraint. Maybe Lagrange multipliers?

Yes, that&#x27;s a possible approach. Let me try that.

Let me denote z = x + yi. Then |z| = sqrt(x² + y²). We need to minimize x² + y² (since sqrt is increasing, minimizing sqrt(x² + y²) is equivalent to minimizing x² + y²).

The constraint is |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0. Let me denote f(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

So using Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of the objective function and the constraint should be proportional.

The objective function is F(x, y) = x² + y².

The constraint is G(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

Compute ∇F = [2x, 2y]

Compute ∇G. This is a bit involved, but let&#x27;s recall that for a function G(x,y) = |A(x, y)| - |B(x, y)|, the gradient is (∇|A| - ∇|B|). So need to compute gradients of |(z +i)^2 -3| and 2|z -i|.

Let me first compute |(z +i)^2 -3|.

Let me denote A = (z +i)^2 -3. Then |A| is modulus of A.

Express A in terms of x and y. As earlier, z = x + yi, so z +i = x + (y +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = x² - (y +1)^2 + 2x(y +1)i. Then subtract 3: [x² - (y +1)^2 -3] + 2x(y +1)i. So A = u + vi where u = x² - (y +1)^2 -3 and v = 2x(y +1).

Thus, |A| = sqrt(u² + v²). The gradient of |A| is ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) )

Similarly, |B| where B = z -i = x + (y -1)i, so |B| = sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2). The gradient of |B| is (x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2), (y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2))

Therefore, gradient of G = ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*(x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*((y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)) )

This seems very complicated, but maybe at the minimal point, there is some symmetry or simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps parameterizing the problem. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|

Let me let z -i = w. Then z = w + i. Then z + i = w + 2i. So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)^2 -3| = 2|w|

So |w² +4i w -4 -3| =2|w|, since (w + 2i)^2 = w² +4i w + (2i)^2 = w² +4i w -4. Then subtract 3: w² +4i w -7.

Thus, |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|

Hmm, maybe if I write this as |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|, perhaps dividing both sides by |w| (assuming w ≠0):

| w +4i -7/w | =2

But not sure if this helps. Let me check:

If w ≠0, then divide both sides by |w|:

| (w² +4i w -7)/w | =2 =&gt; |w +4i -7/w| =2

But this might not necessarily help. Alternatively, set t = w, then |t² +4i t -7| =2|t|. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |t² +4i t -7|² =4|t|²

So (t² +4i t -7)(\overline{t² +4i t -7}) =4|t|²

But this is getting too algebraic. Let me try to write t as x + yi.

Let t = x + yi. Then t² = (x + yi)^2 = x² - y² + 2xyi

4i t =4i(x + yi) = -4y +4x i

So t² +4i t -7 = (x² - y² -4y -7) + (2xy +4x)i

Thus, modulus squared is (x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4(x² + y²)

So equation:

(x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4x² +4y²

Wait, this is the same equation I had earlier when substituting w = t = z -i. So seems like we end up at the same quartic equation. Maybe expanding is the way to go.

Let me try expanding the left side:

First term: (x² - y² -4y -7)^2

Let me expand this:

= (x²)^2 + (-y² -4y -7)^2 + 2x²*(-y² -4y -7)

= x^4 + (y^4 +16y² +49 +8y^3 +14y² +56y) + (-2x²y² -8x²y -14x²)

Wait, similar to before:

Wait, (-y² -4y -7)^2 = (y² +4y +7)^2 = y^4 +8y^3 + (16y² +14y²) +56y +49 = y^4 +8y^3 +30y^2 +56y +49

And the cross term is 2x²*(-y² -4y -7) = -2x²y² -8x²y -14x²

Second term: (2xy +4x)^2 =4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

So left side total:

x^4 + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -2x²y² -8x²y -14x² +4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

Combine like terms:

x^4 + [y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49] + [(-2x²y² +4x²y²) + (-8x²y +16x²y) + (-14x² +16x²)]

Simplify each group:

x^4 remains.

y terms: y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

x²y² terms: (-2 +4)x²y² =2x²y²

x²y terms: (-8 +16)x²y =8x²y

x² terms: (-14 +16)x² =2x²

So left side becomes:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

Set equal to right side 4x² +4y²:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 =4x² +4y²

Bring all terms to left side:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -4x² -4y²=0

Simplify:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y + (2x² -4x²) + y^4 +8y^3 + (30y² -4y²) +56y +49=0

Which simplifies to:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y -2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

This equation is still very complicated. Maybe factorizing or looking for possible substitutions.

Alternatively, maybe trying specific values. For example, suppose x =0. Then the equation becomes:

0 +0 +0 -0 + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

Which is y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0. Let me check if this has real roots. Hmm, possible rational roots are ±1,±7,±49. Testing y = -1:

1 -8 +26 -56 +49 =12 ≠0

y=-7: (-7)^4 +8*(-7)^3 +26*(-7)^2 +56*(-7) +49=2401 -2744 +1274 -392 +49= 2401 -2744= -343; -343 +1274=931; 931 -392=539; 539 +49=588≠0

Not zero. Maybe it factors into quadratics?

Suppose y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49 = (y² + a y + b)(y² +c y +d)

Multiply out:

y^4 + (a +c)y³ + (ac +b +d)y² + (ad + bc)y + bd

Set coefficients:

a +c=8

ac +b +d=26

ad + bc=56

bd=49

Since bd=49, possible pairs (b,d)=(7,7), (49,1), (-7,-7), etc. Let&#x27;s try positive integers first. 7 and7. Then b=7, d=7.

Then a +c=8

ac +7 +7=26 =&gt; ac=12

ad + bc=56 =&gt;7a +7c=56 =&gt;a +c=8. Which matches the first equation. So from a +c=8 and ac=12. Solving:

a and c are roots of t² -8t +12=0. Which factors as (t -6)(t -2)=0. So a=6, c=2 or a=2, c=6.

Check ad + bc: if a=6, c=2, then 7*6 +7*2=42 +14=56. Yes, works. Similarly if a=2, c=6: 7*2 +7*6=14 +42=56. So works.

Therefore, the quartic factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0

So setting x=0, the equation factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0. The roots would be y = [-6 ±sqrt(36 -28)]/2 = [-6 ±sqrt(8)]/2 = [-6 ±2√2]/2 = -3 ±√2. Similarly for the other quadratic: y = [-2 ±sqrt(4 -28)]/2. But sqrt(-24) is imaginary. So real roots are y = -3 +√2 and y = -3 -√2. But since x=0, then z =0 + yi -i = y -i. Wait, no. Wait, we set t = z -i =w, then x and y are coordinates of w. So z = w +i. If w has x=0, then z =0 + (y +1)i. So |z| = sqrt(0 + (y +1)^2) = |y +1|. The real roots for y are -3 ±√2. So |z| would be | (-3 ±√2 ) +1 | = | -2 ±√2 |. So |-2 +√2| and |-2 -√2|. Since √2≈1.414, so -2 +1.414≈-0.586, absolute value≈0.586. The other is |-2 -1.414|=3.414. So minimum |z| is approximately 0.586 when x=0. But is this the minimal overall? Because maybe when x≠0, we can get a smaller |z|.

But first, let&#x27;s check if these points are indeed solutions. If x=0 and y = -3 +√2, then w =0 + (-3 +√2)i, so z = w +i = (-3 +√2)i +i = (-2 +√2)i. Then |z| = | -2 +√2 | ≈0.586. Similarly, the other root gives |z|=3.414. So perhaps 2 -√2 is approximately0.586, which is 2 -1.414≈0.586.

But the question is whether there are other solutions with x≠0 that have smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal |z| occurs on the y-axis (x=0). Let me check that.

If x=0, then z = (0) + (y +1)i. So |z| is |y +1|. The minimal |y +1| occurs at y = -1, which gives |z|=0. But does y=-1 satisfy the equation? Let&#x27;s check.

If x=0 and y=-1, then w = z -i = (0 + (-1)i) -i = -2i. Then check |(w +2i)^2 -3| = |(-2i +2i)^2 -3| = |0 -3| =3. And 2|w| =2*| -2i | =4. 3≠4, so y=-1 is not a solution.

Wait, but when x=0, we had solutions at y= -3 ±√2. The minimal |z| for x=0 is | -2 +√2 |≈0.586. Let&#x27;s see if we can find a solution with x≠0 that has a smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal occurs at another point. Let me consider that |z| is minimal when z is closest to the origin on the curve defined by |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Maybe this curve is a circle or some conic section.

Alternatively, notice that the original equation can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Let me consider squaring both sides:

|(z +i)^2 -3|² = 4|z -i|²

Which can be written as [(z +i)^2 -3][\overline{(z +i)^2 -3}] =4(z -i)(\overline{z -i})

But this might not help unless expanded. Let me try writing z = x + yi and expanding everything again.

Alternatively, maybe notice that (z +i)^2 -3 is a quadratic in z, so the equation represents some quadratic curve. The set of points z where |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i| is likely a circle or an ellipse or hyperbola.

Alternatively, think of this as |(z +i)^2 -3| / |z -i| =2. So the ratio of distances is 2, which resembles the definition of an Apollonius circle. However, typically, Apollonius circle is |z -a| / |z -b| =k, which is a circle. But here, the numerator is |(z +i)^2 -3|, which is not a linear function, so the locus is not a circle. So maybe it&#x27;s a quartic curve.

Given that, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs at one of the points we found on the y-axis. But to confirm, perhaps consider other points.

Alternatively, parameterize the problem with z = ti where t is real. Let me try z = ti, then |z| = |t|. Let&#x27;s check if this satisfies the equation.

z = ti, so z +i = ti +i = (t +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = -(t +1)^2. Then (z +i)^2 -3 = - (t +1)^2 -3. The modulus is | - (t +1)^2 -3 | = (t +1)^2 +3.

On the other side, 2|z -i| =2| ti -i | =2| (t -1)i | =2|t -1|

So the equation becomes (t +1)^2 +3 =2|t -1|

Let me solve this equation.

Case 1: t &gt;=1. Then |t -1|=t -1.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3 =2(t -1)

Expand left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2t -2

So t² +2t +4 =2t -2

t² +6=0. No real solutions.

Case 2: t &lt;1. Then |t -1|=1 -t.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3=2(1 -t)

Left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2 -2t

So t² +2t +4 =2 -2t

t² +4t +2 =0

Solutions: t = [-4 ±sqrt(16 -8)]/2 =[-4 ±sqrt(8)]/2 =[-4 ±2√2]/2= -2 ±√2

So t = -2 +√2≈-0.585 and t=-2 -√2≈-3.414

Check if these are less than1: yes, both are.

So z =ti, so |z| =|t|. So the |z| for these solutions are |-2 +√2|≈0.586 and |-2 -√2|≈3.414. So same as before. So when z is purely imaginary, the minimal |z| is 2 -√2≈0.5857.

But is this the minimal overall? Maybe there are other points not on the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

To check, let&#x27;s suppose that minimal |z| occurs at a point not on the y-axis, so x≠0. To verify, perhaps set y such that the derivative is zero, but given the complexity of the equation, this might be difficult.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal |z| is achieved when z is colinear with the origin and the center of some circle... Wait, but the problem is that the equation is not a circle.

Alternatively, use the triangle inequality. Let me see:

We have |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

Note that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= ||(z +i)^2| -|3|| by the reverse triangle inequality. But not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, expand (z +i)^2 -3:

(z +i)^2 -3 = z² +2i z -1 -3 =z² +2i z -4

So the equation is |z² +2i z -4| =2|z -i|

Hmm, still not helpful. Let me see:

If I let z =0, then |0 +0 -4|=4, and 2|0 -i|=2*1=2. So 4≠2, so z=0 is not a solution.

If z approaches 0, then |z² +2i z -4| ≈4, and 2|z -i|≈2*1=2, so LHS &gt;RHS near z=0. So the minimal |z| must be somewhere else.

Alternatively, consider parametrizing z in terms of |z|. Let me write z = r e^{iθ}, then |z|=r. Then we need to express the equation in terms of r and θ.

But this might be complicated. Let me attempt it.

Express z = r e^{iθ}. Then z +i = r e^{iθ} +i. Let me compute (z +i)^2:

(z +i)^2 = (r e^{iθ} +i)^2 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -1

Therefore, (z +i)^2 -3 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4

So modulus squared is |r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4|² = [r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2

And the right side is 2|z -i| =2| r e^{iθ} -i | =2 sqrt(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

So squaring both sides:

[r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2 =4(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

This equation relates r and θ. To find the minimal r, we can try to analyze this equation.

This looks very involved, but perhaps consider specific angles θ where the equation simplifies.

For instance, let me consider θ = -π/2, which would align z along the negative imaginary axis. Then z = -r i.

Compute left side:

[r² cos(-π) -4]^2 + [r² sin(-π) +2r cos(-π/2)]^2

= [r²*(-1) -4]^2 + [0 +2r*0]^2

= (-r² -4)^2 +0 = (r² +4)^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r*(-1))=4(r² +1 +2r)=4r² +4 +8r

Set equal:

(r² +4)^2 =4r² +8r +4

Expand left: r^4 +8r² +16

So equation: r^4 +8r² +16 =4r² +8r +4

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +4r² -8r +12=0

Not sure if this factors. Testing r=1:1 +4 -8 +12=9≠0

r=2:16 +16 -16 +12=28≠0

No obvious roots. So θ=-π/2 might not yield solutions.

Alternatively, take θ=0, so z is real positive. Then z =r.

Left side:

[r² cos0 -4]^2 +[r² sin0 +2r cos0]^2

= (r² -4)^2 + (0 +2r)^2 = (r² -4)^2 +4r²

Right side:

4(r² +1 -0)=4r² +4

Set equal:

(r² -4)^2 +4r² =4r² +4

Simplify: (r² -4)^2 =4

Take sqrt: r² -4=±2

Case1: r² -4=2 =&gt;r²=6 =&gt;r=√6≈2.449

Case2: r² -4=-2 =&gt;r²=2 =&gt;r=√2≈1.414

So θ=0, solutions at r=√2 and r=√6. So |z|=√2≈1.414 and √6≈2.449. But earlier, on the imaginary axis, we had |z|=2 -√2≈0.586, which is smaller. So these are not minimal.

Alternatively, check θ=π/2, z=ri, but already considered that case.

Alternatively, suppose θ=π/4. Then z = r e^{iπ/4}= r(√2/2 +i√2/2)

Compute left side:

[r² cos(π/2) -4]^2 + [r² sin(π/2) +2r cos(π/4)]^2

= [0 -4]^2 + [r²*1 +2r*(√2/2)]^2

=16 + [r² +√2 r]^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r sin(π/4))=4(r² +1 -2r*(√2/2))=4(r² +1 -√2 r)

Set equal:

16 + (r² +√2 r)^2 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Expand left:

16 +r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r²

Equation:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r² +16 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 -2r² +4√2 r +12=0

This seems difficult to solve. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis, as previously found. To confirm, maybe check another angle.

Alternatively, notice that when we substituted z =ti (i.e., x=0), we found solutions with |z|=2 -√2 and 2 +√2. The smaller one is 2 -√2≈0.5858.

But we need to check if there are any other solutions off the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

Suppose there exists a point z with |z| &lt;2 -√2. Let me assume such a point exists and see if it leads to a contradiction.

Let |z|=r &lt;2 -√2≈0.5858.

But since |z -i| &gt;= | |z| - |i| | = |r -1|. So 2|z -i| &gt;=2(1 -r)

On the other hand, |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= |(z +i)^2| +| -3| = |z +i|² +3. Since |z +i| &lt;=|z| +|i|=r +1. So |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

But we have equality |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So if 2(1 -r) &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

Let me check if this holds for r &lt;2 -√2.

Compute RHS - LHS = (r +1)^2 +3 -2(1 -r)=r² +2r +1 +3 -2 +2r=r² +4r +2

Which is positive for all real r. So this inequality holds for any r, but that doesn&#x27;t give us a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps using other inequalities. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= | |(z +i)^2| - |3| |. Which is | |z +i|² -3 |.

So we have | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;= |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;=2|z -i|

But not sure how helpful this is.

Alternatively, let me assume that the minimal |z| occurs at the point we found on the imaginary axis, 2 -√2≈0.586, and check if there can be any other points with smaller |z|.

Alternatively, note that the equation |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i| can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3|² =4|z -i|², which is the equation we derived earlier. If we assume that the minimal |z| occurs at a point where the gradient is colinear with the position vector, i.e., the point where the curve is tangent to the circle centered at the origin. But calculating this would require using Lagrange multipliers, which is quite involved given the complexity of the equation.

Alternatively, given the earlier solutions on the imaginary axis and given that when minimizing |z|, the closest point might lie on the imaginary axis due to symmetry. Since the equation involves z +i and z -i, which are vertical translations, it&#x27;s possible that the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal value we found is 2 -√2≈0.5858, and since we couldn&#x27;t find any solution with smaller |z|, and given the symmetry, this might be the minimal value.

Therefore, I think the minimal |z| is 2 -√2, achieved when z is on the imaginary axis at z=(-2 +√2)i, so |z|=| -2 +√2 | =2 -√2.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the minimum value of \(|z|\) for complex numbers \(z\) satisfying the equation \(|(z + i)^2 - 3| = 2|z - i|\), we start by substituting \(z = w + i\) where \(w = z - i\). This transforms the equation into \(|(w + 2i)^2 - 3| = 2|w|\).

We then consider \(w = x + yi\) and substitute into the equation. After expanding and simplifying both sides, we find that the equation becomes complex. However, by considering specific cases where \(w\) is purely imaginary (i.e., \(x = 0\)), we simplify the problem.

Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation, we solve for \(y\) and find the roots \(y = -3 \pm \sqrt{2}\). Translating back to \(z\), we get \(z = (-2 + \sqrt{2})i\) and \(z = (-2 - \sqrt{2})i\). The modulus \(|z|\) for these points is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} |\) and \(| -2 - \sqrt{2} |\), respectively.

The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} | = 2 - \sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: There is little difference to finding the minimum value of \(|z|\) over an ellipse because an ellipse has parameters that depend on Common Factors of Equations! Denote the two intersection points of the ellipse&#x27;s lines along the \(x\)-axis with \(x=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a\) and \(x=-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}a\) by \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\). By the principles of complex analysis, we know that the ellipse is centered at \(c=(0,0)\), \(a=\sqrt(2/3)\), \(b=\sqrt{3/2}\). The phase angle \(\theta=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\cot(\pi/3) \right)\). The intersections with the interior of the elliptical hole are \(|z\pm\alpha|\leqslant 2\), \(\alpha =r(\cos\theta\pm i\sin\theta)\). The phase angles for a pair of these complex numbers satisfied by the equation are \(\theta\pm \arctan\left(\frac{|z-i|}{|z+i|}\right)\). The smallest of these is \(\theta-\arctan\left(\frac{|z-i|}{|z+i|}\right)\), which has the minimum at \(\tan\left(\theta-\arctan\left(\frac{|z-i|}{|z+i|}\right)\right)=\tan(\theta\pm\pi/2)=\ \mp 1\). \(\theta=0, or \theta-\pi/2\) so that \(\theta=\arctan\left(\frac{|z-i|}{|z+i|}\right)\). \(\theta=\arctan(1)\Rightarrow \frac{z+i}{z-i}=e^{i\pi}\cdot \frac{(z+i)(z-i) }{(z+i)(z-i)} = -1\). We have obtained that \(\frac{z+i}{z-i}=-1\). So \(\frac{z+i}{z-i}=-1\Rightarrow z^2+2z+1=0 \Rightarrow z_1, z_2=i \Rightarrow z_1=2i, z_2=-2i\).

Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The question is asking for the minimum value of |z| where z is a complex number that satisfies the equation |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Hmm, complex numbers and modulus... I remember that complex numbers can be represented in the complex plane, so maybe I can translate this equation into geometric terms?

First, let me recall that for a complex number z = x + yi, |z| is the modulus, which is √(x² + y²). So |z| represents the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) in the plane. The problem wants the minimum such distance among all z that satisfy the given equation.

The equation given is |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Let me try to break this down. Let&#x27;s substitute z = x + yi into the equation. Then z + i = x + (y + 1)i. Squaring that gives (x + (y + 1)i)². Let me compute that:

(x + (y + 1)i)² = x² + 2x(y + 1)i + [(y + 1)i]²
= x² + 2x(y + 1)i - (y + 1)²
= (x² - (y + 1)²) + 2x(y + 1)i

So (z + i)² - 3 would be [(x² - (y + 1)²) - 3] + 2x(y + 1)i. Then the modulus of this is equal to 2|z - i|. Let&#x27;s compute both sides.

Left side modulus: sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side: 2|z - i| = 2| x + (y - 1)i | = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

So, the equation becomes:

sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²] = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

Hmm, that looks complicated. Maybe squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots would help. Let me try that.

Left side squared: [(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side squared: 4(x² + (y - 1)²)

So expanding the left side:

First, let me denote A = x² - (y + 1)² - 3, and B = 2x(y + 1). Then the left side squared is A² + B².

Compute A²:

[x² - (y + 1)² - 3]^2

Let me expand (y + 1)² first: y² + 2y + 1. So x² - (y² + 2y + 1) - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 1 - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 4.

Therefore, A = x² - y² - 2y - 4, so A² = (x² - y² - 2y - 4)²

Similarly, B = 2x(y + 1), so B² = 4x²(y + 1)²

So left side squared becomes:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4(x² + (y - 1)^2)

Let me expand the right side:

4(x² + y² - 2y + 1) = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

So now, the equation is:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

Hmm, this seems really messy. Maybe there&#x27;s a better way to approach this problem instead of expanding everything. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let w = z - i. Then z = w + i. Let me substitute that into the original equation.

So, |(w + i + i)² - 3| = 2|w + i - i| =&gt; |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

Maybe this substitution simplifies things. Let&#x27;s denote w = a + bi. Then w + 2i = a + (b + 2)i. Then (w + 2i)² is [a + (b + 2)i]² = a² + 2a(b + 2)i + [(b + 2)i]^2 = a² + 2a(b + 2)i - (b + 2)^2

So (w + 2i)^2 - 3 = [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3] + 2a(b + 2)i

Then the modulus squared is [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4|w|^2 = 4(a² + b²)

So expanding the left side:

[a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4(a² + b²)

Let me compute [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2. First, expand (b + 2)^2: b² + 4b + 4. So a² - b² -4b -4 -3 = a² - b² -4b -7. So the first term is (a² - b² -4b -7)^2.

Second term: [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4a²(b + 2)^2

So left side becomes:

(a² - b² -4b -7)^2 + 4a²(b + 2)^2 = 4a² + 4b²

This still seems complicated, but maybe expanding the left side will lead to some cancellation.

First, let&#x27;s expand (a² - b² -4b -7)^2:

= (a²)^2 + (-b² -4b -7)^2 + 2a²(-b² -4b -7)

= a^4 + (b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b² + 56b) + (-2a²b² -8a²b -14a²)

Wait, that&#x27;s a bit messy. Let me do it step by step.

Let me denote C = a² and D = -b² -4b -7. Then (C + D)^2 = C² + 2CD + D².

C² = (a²)^2 = a^4

2CD = 2a²(-b² -4b -7) = -2a²b² -8a²b -14a²

D² = (-b² -4b -7)^2. Let&#x27;s compute that:

= (b² +4b +7)^2

= (b²)^2 + (4b)^2 + (7)^2 + 2*b²*4b + 2*b²*7 + 2*4b*7

= b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b^2 + 56b

= b^4 + 8b^3 + (16b^2 +14b^2) +56b +49

= b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So D² = b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So putting it all together, (a² - b² -4b -7)^2 = a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, adding the second term: 4a²(b + 2)^2

First compute (b + 2)^2 = b² +4b +4. Then 4a²*(b² +4b +4) = 4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

So the entire left side becomes:

a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 +4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

a^4: a^4

a²b² terms: -2a²b² +4a²b² = 2a²b²

a²b terms: -8a²b +16a²b = 8a²b

a² terms: -14a² +16a² = 2a²

b^4: b^4

b^3:8b^3

b^2:30b^2

b terms:56b

constants:49

So left side simplifies to:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, the right side is 4a² +4b²

Therefore, the equation is:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 = 4a² +4b²

Bringing all terms to the left side:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 -4a² -4b² =0

Simplify:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b + (2a² -4a²) + b^4 +8b^3 + (30b^2 -4b^2) +56b +49 =0

Which simplifies to:

a^4 +2a²b² +8a²b -2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +26b^2 +56b +49=0

Hmm, this still looks quite complicated. Maybe there&#x27;s a different approach here. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z - i|

Perhaps instead of substituting z = x + yi, I can interpret this geometrically. Let me recall that for complex numbers, |A - B| represents the distance between points A and B in the complex plane.

But here, the equation is |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Hmm, that&#x27;s not a straightforward distance. Alternatively, maybe I can see (z + i)^2 as some transformation of z. Squaring a complex number can be seen as a geometric transformation: squaring the modulus and doubling the angle. But I&#x27;m not sure how that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe set w = z + i, so z = w - i. Then the equation becomes |w² - 3| = 2|w - 2i|

But maybe this substitution can help. Let me check:

Original substitution: z = w - i, so z + i = w, and z - i = w - 2i. Then the equation |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

So we have |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Maybe this is easier to handle. Let me denote w = a + bi. Then w² = (a + bi)^2 = a² - b² + 2abi. Then w² - 3 = (a² - b² -3) + 2abi. The modulus of this is sqrt[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] and the right side is 2*sqrt[a² + (b - 2)^2]. Then squaring both sides:

[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] = 4[a² + (b -2)^2]

But this seems similar to the previous approach. Maybe expanding this will lead to the same equation.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a parametrization or polar coordinates. Let me try that. Let me set w = r e^{iθ}, where r = |w|, θ is the argument.

Then |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Expressing in polar coordinates:

|r² e^{i2θ} -3| = 2 | r e^{iθ} - 2i|

But this might not lead to an easy equation either. Let me compute both sides.

Left side modulus: |r² e^{i2θ} -3|. This is the distance from the point (r² cos 2θ, r² sin 2θ) to (3, 0).

Right side: 2|r e^{iθ} - 2i| = 2| (r cos θ) + i(r sin θ - 2)| = 2 sqrt[ (r cos θ)^2 + (r sin θ -2)^2 ]

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps consider specific points. For example, if z is real, then z = x, so y =0. Then compute if that satisfies the equation.

But maybe that&#x27;s too restrictive. The minimum |z| might not occur on the real axis. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus. Let me consider that |z| is the distance from the origin, and we need to minimize this distance subject to the constraint |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. So this is an optimization problem with a constraint. Maybe Lagrange multipliers?

Yes, that&#x27;s a possible approach. Let me try that.

Let me denote z = x + yi. Then |z| = sqrt(x² + y²). We need to minimize x² + y² (since sqrt is increasing, minimizing sqrt(x² + y²) is equivalent to minimizing x² + y²).

The constraint is |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0. Let me denote f(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

So using Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of the objective function and the constraint should be proportional.

The objective function is F(x, y) = x² + y².

The constraint is G(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

Compute ∇F = [2x, 2y]

Compute ∇G. This is a bit involved, but let&#x27;s recall that for a function G(x,y) = |A(x, y)| - |B(x, y)|, the gradient is (∇|A| - ∇|B|). So need to compute gradients of |(z +i)^2 -3| and 2|z -i|.

Let me first compute |(z +i)^2 -3|.

Let me denote A = (z +i)^2 -3. Then |A| is modulus of A.

Express A in terms of x and y. As earlier, z = x + yi, so z +i = x + (y +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = x² - (y +1)^2 + 2x(y +1)i. Then subtract 3: [x² - (y +1)^2 -3] + 2x(y +1)i. So A = u + vi where u = x² - (y +1)^2 -3 and v = 2x(y +1).

Thus, |A| = sqrt(u² + v²). The gradient of |A| is ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) )

Similarly, |B| where B = z -i = x + (y -1)i, so |B| = sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2). The gradient of |B| is (x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2), (y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2))

Therefore, gradient of G = ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*(x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*((y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)) )

This seems very complicated, but maybe at the minimal point, there is some symmetry or simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps parameterizing the problem. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|

Let me let z -i = w. Then z = w + i. Then z + i = w + 2i. So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)^2 -3| = 2|w|

So |w² +4i w -4 -3| =2|w|, since (w + 2i)^2 = w² +4i w + (2i)^2 = w² +4i w -4. Then subtract 3: w² +4i w -7.

Thus, |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|

Hmm, maybe if I write this as |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|, perhaps dividing both sides by |w| (assuming w ≠0):

| w +4i -7/w | =2

But not sure if this helps. Let me check:

If w ≠0, then divide both sides by |w|:

| (w² +4i w -7)/w | =2 =&gt; |w +4i -7/w| =2

But this might not necessarily help. Alternatively, set t = w, then |t² +4i t -7| =2|t|. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |t² +4i t -7|² =4|t|²

So (t² +4i t -7)(\overline{t² +4i t -7}) =4|t|²

But this is getting too algebraic. Let me try to write t as x + yi.

Let t = x + yi. Then t² = (x + yi)^2 = x² - y² + 2xyi

4i t =4i(x + yi) = -4y +4x i

So t² +4i t -7 = (x² - y² -4y -7) + (2xy +4x)i

Thus, modulus squared is (x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4(x² + y²)

So equation:

(x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4x² +4y²

Wait, this is the same equation I had earlier when substituting w = t = z -i. So seems like we end up at the same quartic equation. Maybe expanding is the way to go.

Let me try expanding the left side:

First term: (x² - y² -4y -7)^2

Let me expand this:

= (x²)^2 + (-y² -4y -7)^2 + 2x²*(-y² -4y -7)

= x^4 + (y^4 +16y² +49 +8y^3 +14y² +56y) + (-2x²y² -8x²y -14x²)

Wait, similar to before:

Wait, (-y² -4y -7)^2 = (y² +4y +7)^2 = y^4 +8y^3 + (16y² +14y²) +56y +49 = y^4 +8y^3 +30y^2 +56y +49

And the cross term is 2x²*(-y² -4y -7) = -2x²y² -8x²y -14x²

Second term: (2xy +4x)^2 =4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

So left side total:

x^4 + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -2x²y² -8x²y -14x² +4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

Combine like terms:

x^4 + [y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49] + [(-2x²y² +4x²y²) + (-8x²y +16x²y) + (-14x² +16x²)]

Simplify each group:

x^4 remains.

y terms: y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

x²y² terms: (-2 +4)x²y² =2x²y²

x²y terms: (-8 +16)x²y =8x²y

x² terms: (-14 +16)x² =2x²

So left side becomes:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

Set equal to right side 4x² +4y²:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 =4x² +4y²

Bring all terms to left side:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -4x² -4y²=0

Simplify:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y + (2x² -4x²) + y^4 +8y^3 + (30y² -4y²) +56y +49=0

Which simplifies to:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y -2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

This equation is still very complicated. Maybe factorizing or looking for possible substitutions.

Alternatively, maybe trying specific values. For example, suppose x =0. Then the equation becomes:

0 +0 +0 -0 + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

Which is y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0. Let me check if this has real roots. Hmm, possible rational roots are ±1,±7,±49. Testing y = -1:

1 -8 +26 -56 +49 =12 ≠0

y=-7: (-7)^4 +8*(-7)^3 +26*(-7)^2 +56*(-7) +49=2401 -2744 +1274 -392 +49= 2401 -2744= -343; -343 +1274=931; 931 -392=539; 539 +49=588≠0

Not zero. Maybe it factors into quadratics?

Suppose y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49 = (y² + a y + b)(y² +c y +d)

Multiply out:

y^4 + (a +c)y³ + (ac +b +d)y² + (ad + bc)y + bd

Set coefficients:

a +c=8

ac +b +d=26

ad + bc=56

bd=49

Since bd=49, possible pairs (b,d)=(7,7), (49,1), (-7,-7), etc. Let&#x27;s try positive integers first. 7 and7. Then b=7, d=7.

Then a +c=8

ac +7 +7=26 =&gt; ac=12

ad + bc=56 =&gt;7a +7c=56 =&gt;a +c=8. Which matches the first equation. So from a +c=8 and ac=12. Solving:

a and c are roots of t² -8t +12=0. Which factors as (t -6)(t -2)=0. So a=6, c=2 or a=2, c=6.

Check ad + bc: if a=6, c=2, then 7*6 +7*2=42 +14=56. Yes, works. Similarly if a=2, c=6: 7*2 +7*6=14 +42=56. So works.

Therefore, the quartic factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0

So setting x=0, the equation factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0. The roots would be y = [-6 ±sqrt(36 -28)]/2 = [-6 ±sqrt(8)]/2 = [-6 ±2√2]/2 = -3 ±√2. Similarly for the other quadratic: y = [-2 ±sqrt(4 -28)]/2. But sqrt(-24) is imaginary. So real roots are y = -3 +√2 and y = -3 -√2. But since x=0, then z =0 + yi -i = y -i. Wait, no. Wait, we set t = z -i =w, then x and y are coordinates of w. So z = w +i. If w has x=0, then z =0 + (y +1)i. So |z| = sqrt(0 + (y +1)^2) = |y +1|. The real roots for y are -3 ±√2. So |z| would be | (-3 ±√2 ) +1 | = | -2 ±√2 |. So |-2 +√2| and |-2 -√2|. Since √2≈1.414, so -2 +1.414≈-0.586, absolute value≈0.586. The other is |-2 -1.414|=3.414. So minimum |z| is approximately 0.586 when x=0. But is this the minimal overall? Because maybe when x≠0, we can get a smaller |z|.

But first, let&#x27;s check if these points are indeed solutions. If x=0 and y = -3 +√2, then w =0 + (-3 +√2)i, so z = w +i = (-3 +√2)i +i = (-2 +√2)i. Then |z| = | -2 +√2 | ≈0.586. Similarly, the other root gives |z|=3.414. So perhaps 2 -√2 is approximately0.586, which is 2 -1.414≈0.586.

But the question is whether there are other solutions with x≠0 that have smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal |z| occurs on the y-axis (x=0). Let me check that.

If x=0, then z = (0) + (y +1)i. So |z| is |y +1|. The minimal |y +1| occurs at y = -1, which gives |z|=0. But does y=-1 satisfy the equation? Let&#x27;s check.

If x=0 and y=-1, then w = z -i = (0 + (-1)i) -i = -2i. Then check |(w +2i)^2 -3| = |(-2i +2i)^2 -3| = |0 -3| =3. And 2|w| =2*| -2i | =4. 3≠4, so y=-1 is not a solution.

Wait, but when x=0, we had solutions at y= -3 ±√2. The minimal |z| for x=0 is | -2 +√2 |≈0.586. Let&#x27;s see if we can find a solution with x≠0 that has a smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal occurs at another point. Let me consider that |z| is minimal when z is closest to the origin on the curve defined by |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Maybe this curve is a circle or some conic section.

Alternatively, notice that the original equation can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Let me consider squaring both sides:

|(z +i)^2 -3|² = 4|z -i|²

Which can be written as [(z +i)^2 -3][\overline{(z +i)^2 -3}] =4(z -i)(\overline{z -i})

But this might not help unless expanded. Let me try writing z = x + yi and expanding everything again.

Alternatively, maybe notice that (z +i)^2 -3 is a quadratic in z, so the equation represents some quadratic curve. The set of points z where |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i| is likely a circle or an ellipse or hyperbola.

Alternatively, think of this as |(z +i)^2 -3| / |z -i| =2. So the ratio of distances is 2, which resembles the definition of an Apollonius circle. However, typically, Apollonius circle is |z -a| / |z -b| =k, which is a circle. But here, the numerator is |(z +i)^2 -3|, which is not a linear function, so the locus is not a circle. So maybe it&#x27;s a quartic curve.

Given that, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs at one of the points we found on the y-axis. But to confirm, perhaps consider other points.

Alternatively, parameterize the problem with z = ti where t is real. Let me try z = ti, then |z| = |t|. Let&#x27;s check if this satisfies the equation.

z = ti, so z +i = ti +i = (t +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = -(t +1)^2. Then (z +i)^2 -3 = - (t +1)^2 -3. The modulus is | - (t +1)^2 -3 | = (t +1)^2 +3.

On the other side, 2|z -i| =2| ti -i | =2| (t -1)i | =2|t -1|

So the equation becomes (t +1)^2 +3 =2|t -1|

Let me solve this equation.

Case 1: t &gt;=1. Then |t -1|=t -1.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3 =2(t -1)

Expand left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2t -2

So t² +2t +4 =2t -2

t² +6=0. No real solutions.

Case 2: t &lt;1. Then |t -1|=1 -t.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3=2(1 -t)

Left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2 -2t

So t² +2t +4 =2 -2t

t² +4t +2 =0

Solutions: t = [-4 ±sqrt(16 -8)]/2 =[-4 ±sqrt(8)]/2 =[-4 ±2√2]/2= -2 ±√2

So t = -2 +√2≈-0.585 and t=-2 -√2≈-3.414

Check if these are less than1: yes, both are.

So z =ti, so |z| =|t|. So the |z| for these solutions are |-2 +√2|≈0.586 and |-2 -√2|≈3.414. So same as before. So when z is purely imaginary, the minimal |z| is 2 -√2≈0.5857.

But is this the minimal overall? Maybe there are other points not on the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

To check, let&#x27;s suppose that minimal |z| occurs at a point not on the y-axis, so x≠0. To verify, perhaps set y such that the derivative is zero, but given the complexity of the equation, this might be difficult.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal |z| is achieved when z is colinear with the origin and the center of some circle... Wait, but the problem is that the equation is not a circle.

Alternatively, use the triangle inequality. Let me see:

We have |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

Note that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= ||(z +i)^2| -|3|| by the reverse triangle inequality. But not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, expand (z +i)^2 -3:

(z +i)^2 -3 = z² +2i z -1 -3 =z² +2i z -4

So the equation is |z² +2i z -4| =2|z -i|

Hmm, still not helpful. Let me see:

If I let z =0, then |0 +0 -4|=4, and 2|0 -i|=2*1=2. So 4≠2, so z=0 is not a solution.

If z approaches 0, then |z² +2i z -4| ≈4, and 2|z -i|≈2*1=2, so LHS &gt;RHS near z=0. So the minimal |z| must be somewhere else.

Alternatively, consider parametrizing z in terms of |z|. Let me write z = r e^{iθ}, then |z|=r. Then we need to express the equation in terms of r and θ.

But this might be complicated. Let me attempt it.

Express z = r e^{iθ}. Then z +i = r e^{iθ} +i. Let me compute (z +i)^2:

(z +i)^2 = (r e^{iθ} +i)^2 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -1

Therefore, (z +i)^2 -3 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4

So modulus squared is |r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4|² = [r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2

And the right side is 2|z -i| =2| r e^{iθ} -i | =2 sqrt(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

So squaring both sides:

[r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2 =4(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

This equation relates r and θ. To find the minimal r, we can try to analyze this equation.

This looks very involved, but perhaps consider specific angles θ where the equation simplifies.

For instance, let me consider θ = -π/2, which would align z along the negative imaginary axis. Then z = -r i.

Compute left side:

[r² cos(-π) -4]^2 + [r² sin(-π) +2r cos(-π/2)]^2

= [r²*(-1) -4]^2 + [0 +2r*0]^2

= (-r² -4)^2 +0 = (r² +4)^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r*(-1))=4(r² +1 +2r)=4r² +4 +8r

Set equal:

(r² +4)^2 =4r² +8r +4

Expand left: r^4 +8r² +16

So equation: r^4 +8r² +16 =4r² +8r +4

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +4r² -8r +12=0

Not sure if this factors. Testing r=1:1 +4 -8 +12=9≠0

r=2:16 +16 -16 +12=28≠0

No obvious roots. So θ=-π/2 might not yield solutions.

Alternatively, take θ=0, so z is real positive. Then z =r.

Left side:

[r² cos0 -4]^2 +[r² sin0 +2r cos0]^2

= (r² -4)^2 + (0 +2r)^2 = (r² -4)^2 +4r²

Right side:

4(r² +1 -0)=4r² +4

Set equal:

(r² -4)^2 +4r² =4r² +4

Simplify: (r² -4)^2 =4

Take sqrt: r² -4=±2

Case1: r² -4=2 =&gt;r²=6 =&gt;r=√6≈2.449

Case2: r² -4=-2 =&gt;r²=2 =&gt;r=√2≈1.414

So θ=0, solutions at r=√2 and r=√6. So |z|=√2≈1.414 and √6≈2.449. But earlier, on the imaginary axis, we had |z|=2 -√2≈0.586, which is smaller. So these are not minimal.

Alternatively, check θ=π/2, z=ri, but already considered that case.

Alternatively, suppose θ=π/4. Then z = r e^{iπ/4}= r(√2/2 +i√2/2)

Compute left side:

[r² cos(π/2) -4]^2 + [r² sin(π/2) +2r cos(π/4)]^2

= [0 -4]^2 + [r²*1 +2r*(√2/2)]^2

=16 + [r² +√2 r]^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r sin(π/4))=4(r² +1 -2r*(√2/2))=4(r² +1 -√2 r)

Set equal:

16 + (r² +√2 r)^2 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Expand left:

16 +r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r²

Equation:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r² +16 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 -2r² +4√2 r +12=0

This seems difficult to solve. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis, as previously found. To confirm, maybe check another angle.

Alternatively, notice that when we substituted z =ti (i.e., x=0), we found solutions with |z|=2 -√2 and 2 +√2. The smaller one is 2 -√2≈0.5858.

But we need to check if there are any other solutions off the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

Suppose there exists a point z with |z| &lt;2 -√2. Let me assume such a point exists and see if it leads to a contradiction.

Let |z|=r &lt;2 -√2≈0.5858.

But since |z -i| &gt;= | |z| - |i| | = |r -1|. So 2|z -i| &gt;=2(1 -r)

On the other hand, |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= |(z +i)^2| +| -3| = |z +i|² +3. Since |z +i| &lt;=|z| +|i|=r +1. So |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

But we have equality |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So if 2(1 -r) &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

Let me check if this holds for r &lt;2 -√2.

Compute RHS - LHS = (r +1)^2 +3 -2(1 -r)=r² +2r +1 +3 -2 +2r=r² +4r +2

Which is positive for all real r. So this inequality holds for any r, but that doesn&#x27;t give us a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps using other inequalities. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= | |(z +i)^2| - |3| |. Which is | |z +i|² -3 |.

So we have | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;= |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;=2|z -i|

But not sure how helpful this is.

Alternatively, let me assume that the minimal |z| occurs at the point we found on the imaginary axis, 2 -√2≈0.586, and check if there can be any other points with smaller |z|.

Alternatively, note that the equation |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i| can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3|² =4|z -i|², which is the equation we derived earlier. If we assume that the minimal |z| occurs at a point where the gradient is colinear with the position vector, i.e., the point where the curve is tangent to the circle centered at the origin. But calculating this would require using Lagrange multipliers, which is quite involved given the complexity of the equation.

Alternatively, given the earlier solutions on the imaginary axis and given that when minimizing |z|, the closest point might lie on the imaginary axis due to symmetry. Since the equation involves z +i and z -i, which are vertical translations, it&#x27;s possible that the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal value we found is 2 -√2≈0.5858, and since we couldn&#x27;t find any solution with smaller |z|, and given the symmetry, this might be the minimal value.

Therefore, I think the minimal |z| is 2 -√2, achieved when z is on the imaginary axis at z=(-2 +√2)i, so |z|=| -2 +√2 | =2 -√2.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the minimum value of \(|z|\) for complex numbers \(z\) satisfying the equation \(|(z + i)^2 - 3| = 2|z - i|\), we start by substituting \(z = w + i\) where \(w = z - i\). This transforms the equation into \(|(w + 2i)^2 - 3| = 2|w|\).

We then consider \(w = x + yi\) and substitute into the equation. After expanding and simplifying both sides, we find that the equation becomes complex. However, by considering specific cases where \(w\) is purely imaginary (i.e., \(x = 0\)), we simplify the problem.

Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation, we solve for \(y\) and find the roots \(y = -3 \pm \sqrt{2}\). Translating back to \(z\), we get \(z = (-2 + \sqrt{2})i\) and \(z = (-2 - \sqrt{2})i\). The modulus \(|z|\) for these points is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} |\) and \(| -2 - \sqrt{2} |\), respectively.

The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} | = 2 - \sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The question is asking for the minimum value of |z| where z is a complex number that satisfies the equation |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Hmm, complex numbers and modulus... I remember that complex numbers can be represented in the complex plane, so maybe I can translate this equation into geometric terms?

First, let me recall that for a complex number z = x + yi, |z| is the modulus, which is √(x² + y²). So |z| represents the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) in the plane. The problem wants the minimum such distance among all z that satisfy the given equation.

The equation given is |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Let me try to break this down. Let&#x27;s substitute z = x + yi into the equation. Then z + i = x + (y + 1)i. Squaring that gives (x + (y + 1)i)². Let me compute that:

(x + (y + 1)i)² = x² + 2x(y + 1)i + [(y + 1)i]²
= x² + 2x(y + 1)i - (y + 1)²
= (x² - (y + 1)²) + 2x(y + 1)i

So (z + i)² - 3 would be [(x² - (y + 1)²) - 3] + 2x(y + 1)i. Then the modulus of this is equal to 2|z - i|. Let&#x27;s compute both sides.

Left side modulus: sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side: 2|z - i| = 2| x + (y - 1)i | = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

So, the equation becomes:

sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²] = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

Hmm, that looks complicated. Maybe squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots would help. Let me try that.

Left side squared: [(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side squared: 4(x² + (y - 1)²)

So expanding the left side:

First, let me denote A = x² - (y + 1)² - 3, and B = 2x(y + 1). Then the left side squared is A² + B².

Compute A²:

[x² - (y + 1)² - 3]^2

Let me expand (y + 1)² first: y² + 2y + 1. So x² - (y² + 2y + 1) - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 1 - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 4.

Therefore, A = x² - y² - 2y - 4, so A² = (x² - y² - 2y - 4)²

Similarly, B = 2x(y + 1), so B² = 4x²(y + 1)²

So left side squared becomes:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4(x² + (y - 1)^2)

Let me expand the right side:

4(x² + y² - 2y + 1) = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

So now, the equation is:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

Hmm, this seems really messy. Maybe there&#x27;s a better way to approach this problem instead of expanding everything. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let w = z - i. Then z = w + i. Let me substitute that into the original equation.

So, |(w + i + i)² - 3| = 2|w + i - i| =&gt; |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

Maybe this substitution simplifies things. Let&#x27;s denote w = a + bi. Then w + 2i = a + (b + 2)i. Then (w + 2i)² is [a + (b + 2)i]² = a² + 2a(b + 2)i + [(b + 2)i]^2 = a² + 2a(b + 2)i - (b + 2)^2

So (w + 2i)^2 - 3 = [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3] + 2a(b + 2)i

Then the modulus squared is [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4|w|^2 = 4(a² + b²)

So expanding the left side:

[a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4(a² + b²)

Let me compute [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2. First, expand (b + 2)^2: b² + 4b + 4. So a² - b² -4b -4 -3 = a² - b² -4b -7. So the first term is (a² - b² -4b -7)^2.

Second term: [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4a²(b + 2)^2

So left side becomes:

(a² - b² -4b -7)^2 + 4a²(b + 2)^2 = 4a² + 4b²

This still seems complicated, but maybe expanding the left side will lead to some cancellation.

First, let&#x27;s expand (a² - b² -4b -7)^2:

= (a²)^2 + (-b² -4b -7)^2 + 2a²(-b² -4b -7)

= a^4 + (b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b² + 56b) + (-2a²b² -8a²b -14a²)

Wait, that&#x27;s a bit messy. Let me do it step by step.

Let me denote C = a² and D = -b² -4b -7. Then (C + D)^2 = C² + 2CD + D².

C² = (a²)^2 = a^4

2CD = 2a²(-b² -4b -7) = -2a²b² -8a²b -14a²

D² = (-b² -4b -7)^2. Let&#x27;s compute that:

= (b² +4b +7)^2

= (b²)^2 + (4b)^2 + (7)^2 + 2*b²*4b + 2*b²*7 + 2*4b*7

= b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b^2 + 56b

= b^4 + 8b^3 + (16b^2 +14b^2) +56b +49

= b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So D² = b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So putting it all together, (a² - b² -4b -7)^2 = a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, adding the second term: 4a²(b + 2)^2

First compute (b + 2)^2 = b² +4b +4. Then 4a²*(b² +4b +4) = 4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

So the entire left side becomes:

a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 +4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

a^4: a^4

a²b² terms: -2a²b² +4a²b² = 2a²b²

a²b terms: -8a²b +16a²b = 8a²b

a² terms: -14a² +16a² = 2a²

b^4: b^4

b^3:8b^3

b^2:30b^2

b terms:56b

constants:49

So left side simplifies to:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, the right side is 4a² +4b²

Therefore, the equation is:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 = 4a² +4b²

Bringing all terms to the left side:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 -4a² -4b² =0

Simplify:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b + (2a² -4a²) + b^4 +8b^3 + (30b^2 -4b^2) +56b +49 =0

Which simplifies to:

a^4 +2a²b² +8a²b -2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +26b^2 +56b +49=0

Hmm, this still looks quite complicated. Maybe there&#x27;s a different approach here. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z - i|

Perhaps instead of substituting z = x + yi, I can interpret this geometrically. Let me recall that for complex numbers, |A - B| represents the distance between points A and B in the complex plane.

But here, the equation is |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Hmm, that&#x27;s not a straightforward distance. Alternatively, maybe I can see (z + i)^2 as some transformation of z. Squaring a complex number can be seen as a geometric transformation: squaring the modulus and doubling the angle. But I&#x27;m not sure how that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe set w = z + i, so z = w - i. Then the equation becomes |w² - 3| = 2|w - 2i|

But maybe this substitution can help. Let me check:

Original substitution: z = w - i, so z + i = w, and z - i = w - 2i. Then the equation |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

So we have |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Maybe this is easier to handle. Let me denote w = a + bi. Then w² = (a + bi)^2 = a² - b² + 2abi. Then w² - 3 = (a² - b² -3) + 2abi. The modulus of this is sqrt[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] and the right side is 2*sqrt[a² + (b - 2)^2]. Then squaring both sides:

[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] = 4[a² + (b -2)^2]

But this seems similar to the previous approach. Maybe expanding this will lead to the same equation.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a parametrization or polar coordinates. Let me try that. Let me set w = r e^{iθ}, where r = |w|, θ is the argument.

Then |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Expressing in polar coordinates:

|r² e^{i2θ} -3| = 2 | r e^{iθ} - 2i|

But this might not lead to an easy equation either. Let me compute both sides.

Left side modulus: |r² e^{i2θ} -3|. This is the distance from the point (r² cos 2θ, r² sin 2θ) to (3, 0).

Right side: 2|r e^{iθ} - 2i| = 2| (r cos θ) + i(r sin θ - 2)| = 2 sqrt[ (r cos θ)^2 + (r sin θ -2)^2 ]

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps consider specific points. For example, if z is real, then z = x, so y =0. Then compute if that satisfies the equation.

But maybe that&#x27;s too restrictive. The minimum |z| might not occur on the real axis. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus. Let me consider that |z| is the distance from the origin, and we need to minimize this distance subject to the constraint |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. So this is an optimization problem with a constraint. Maybe Lagrange multipliers?

Yes, that&#x27;s a possible approach. Let me try that.

Let me denote z = x + yi. Then |z| = sqrt(x² + y²). We need to minimize x² + y² (since sqrt is increasing, minimizing sqrt(x² + y²) is equivalent to minimizing x² + y²).

The constraint is |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0. Let me denote f(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

So using Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of the objective function and the constraint should be proportional.

The objective function is F(x, y) = x² + y².

The constraint is G(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

Compute ∇F = [2x, 2y]

Compute ∇G. This is a bit involved, but let&#x27;s recall that for a function G(x,y) = |A(x, y)| - |B(x, y)|, the gradient is (∇|A| - ∇|B|). So need to compute gradients of |(z +i)^2 -3| and 2|z -i|.

Let me first compute |(z +i)^2 -3|.

Let me denote A = (z +i)^2 -3. Then |A| is modulus of A.

Express A in terms of x and y. As earlier, z = x + yi, so z +i = x + (y +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = x² - (y +1)^2 + 2x(y +1)i. Then subtract 3: [x² - (y +1)^2 -3] + 2x(y +1)i. So A = u + vi where u = x² - (y +1)^2 -3 and v = 2x(y +1).

Thus, |A| = sqrt(u² + v²). The gradient of |A| is ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) )

Similarly, |B| where B = z -i = x + (y -1)i, so |B| = sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2). The gradient of |B| is (x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2), (y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2))

Therefore, gradient of G = ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*(x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*((y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)) )

This seems very complicated, but maybe at the minimal point, there is some symmetry or simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps parameterizing the problem. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|

Let me let z -i = w. Then z = w + i. Then z + i = w + 2i. So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)^2 -3| = 2|w|

So |w² +4i w -4 -3| =2|w|, since (w + 2i)^2 = w² +4i w + (2i)^2 = w² +4i w -4. Then subtract 3: w² +4i w -7.

Thus, |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|

Hmm, maybe if I write this as |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|, perhaps dividing both sides by |w| (assuming w ≠0):

| w +4i -7/w | =2

But not sure if this helps. Let me check:

If w ≠0, then divide both sides by |w|:

| (w² +4i w -7)/w | =2 =&gt; |w +4i -7/w| =2

But this might not necessarily help. Alternatively, set t = w, then |t² +4i t -7| =2|t|. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |t² +4i t -7|² =4|t|²

So (t² +4i t -7)(\overline{t² +4i t -7}) =4|t|²

But this is getting too algebraic. Let me try to write t as x + yi.

Let t = x + yi. Then t² = (x + yi)^2 = x² - y² + 2xyi

4i t =4i(x + yi) = -4y +4x i

So t² +4i t -7 = (x² - y² -4y -7) + (2xy +4x)i

Thus, modulus squared is (x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4(x² + y²)

So equation:

(x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4x² +4y²

Wait, this is the same equation I had earlier when substituting w = t = z -i. So seems like we end up at the same quartic equation. Maybe expanding is the way to go.

Let me try expanding the left side:

First term: (x² - y² -4y -7)^2

Let me expand this:

= (x²)^2 + (-y² -4y -7)^2 + 2x²*(-y² -4y -7)

= x^4 + (y^4 +16y² +49 +8y^3 +14y² +56y) + (-2x²y² -8x²y -14x²)

Wait, similar to before:

Wait, (-y² -4y -7)^2 = (y² +4y +7)^2 = y^4 +8y^3 + (16y² +14y²) +56y +49 = y^4 +8y^3 +30y^2 +56y +49

And the cross term is 2x²*(-y² -4y -7) = -2x²y² -8x²y -14x²

Second term: (2xy +4x)^2 =4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

So left side total:

x^4 + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -2x²y² -8x²y -14x² +4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

Combine like terms:

x^4 + [y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49] + [(-2x²y² +4x²y²) + (-8x²y +16x²y) + (-14x² +16x²)]

Simplify each group:

x^4 remains.

y terms: y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

x²y² terms: (-2 +4)x²y² =2x²y²

x²y terms: (-8 +16)x²y =8x²y

x² terms: (-14 +16)x² =2x²

So left side becomes:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

Set equal to right side 4x² +4y²:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 =4x² +4y²

Bring all terms to left side:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -4x² -4y²=0

Simplify:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y + (2x² -4x²) + y^4 +8y^3 + (30y² -4y²) +56y +49=0

Which simplifies to:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y -2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

This equation is still very complicated. Maybe factorizing or looking for possible substitutions.

Alternatively, maybe trying specific values. For example, suppose x =0. Then the equation becomes:

0 +0 +0 -0 + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

Which is y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0. Let me check if this has real roots. Hmm, possible rational roots are ±1,±7,±49. Testing y = -1:

1 -8 +26 -56 +49 =12 ≠0

y=-7: (-7)^4 +8*(-7)^3 +26*(-7)^2 +56*(-7) +49=2401 -2744 +1274 -392 +49= 2401 -2744= -343; -343 +1274=931; 931 -392=539; 539 +49=588≠0

Not zero. Maybe it factors into quadratics?

Suppose y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49 = (y² + a y + b)(y² +c y +d)

Multiply out:

y^4 + (a +c)y³ + (ac +b +d)y² + (ad + bc)y + bd

Set coefficients:

a +c=8

ac +b +d=26

ad + bc=56

bd=49

Since bd=49, possible pairs (b,d)=(7,7), (49,1), (-7,-7), etc. Let&#x27;s try positive integers first. 7 and7. Then b=7, d=7.

Then a +c=8

ac +7 +7=26 =&gt; ac=12

ad + bc=56 =&gt;7a +7c=56 =&gt;a +c=8. Which matches the first equation. So from a +c=8 and ac=12. Solving:

a and c are roots of t² -8t +12=0. Which factors as (t -6)(t -2)=0. So a=6, c=2 or a=2, c=6.

Check ad + bc: if a=6, c=2, then 7*6 +7*2=42 +14=56. Yes, works. Similarly if a=2, c=6: 7*2 +7*6=14 +42=56. So works.

Therefore, the quartic factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0

So setting x=0, the equation factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0. The roots would be y = [-6 ±sqrt(36 -28)]/2 = [-6 ±sqrt(8)]/2 = [-6 ±2√2]/2 = -3 ±√2. Similarly for the other quadratic: y = [-2 ±sqrt(4 -28)]/2. But sqrt(-24) is imaginary. So real roots are y = -3 +√2 and y = -3 -√2. But since x=0, then z =0 + yi -i = y -i. Wait, no. Wait, we set t = z -i =w, then x and y are coordinates of w. So z = w +i. If w has x=0, then z =0 + (y +1)i. So |z| = sqrt(0 + (y +1)^2) = |y +1|. The real roots for y are -3 ±√2. So |z| would be | (-3 ±√2 ) +1 | = | -2 ±√2 |. So |-2 +√2| and |-2 -√2|. Since √2≈1.414, so -2 +1.414≈-0.586, absolute value≈0.586. The other is |-2 -1.414|=3.414. So minimum |z| is approximately 0.586 when x=0. But is this the minimal overall? Because maybe when x≠0, we can get a smaller |z|.

But first, let&#x27;s check if these points are indeed solutions. If x=0 and y = -3 +√2, then w =0 + (-3 +√2)i, so z = w +i = (-3 +√2)i +i = (-2 +√2)i. Then |z| = | -2 +√2 | ≈0.586. Similarly, the other root gives |z|=3.414. So perhaps 2 -√2 is approximately0.586, which is 2 -1.414≈0.586.

But the question is whether there are other solutions with x≠0 that have smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal |z| occurs on the y-axis (x=0). Let me check that.

If x=0, then z = (0) + (y +1)i. So |z| is |y +1|. The minimal |y +1| occurs at y = -1, which gives |z|=0. But does y=-1 satisfy the equation? Let&#x27;s check.

If x=0 and y=-1, then w = z -i = (0 + (-1)i) -i = -2i. Then check |(w +2i)^2 -3| = |(-2i +2i)^2 -3| = |0 -3| =3. And 2|w| =2*| -2i | =4. 3≠4, so y=-1 is not a solution.

Wait, but when x=0, we had solutions at y= -3 ±√2. The minimal |z| for x=0 is | -2 +√2 |≈0.586. Let&#x27;s see if we can find a solution with x≠0 that has a smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal occurs at another point. Let me consider that |z| is minimal when z is closest to the origin on the curve defined by |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Maybe this curve is a circle or some conic section.

Alternatively, notice that the original equation can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Let me consider squaring both sides:

|(z +i)^2 -3|² = 4|z -i|²

Which can be written as [(z +i)^2 -3][\overline{(z +i)^2 -3}] =4(z -i)(\overline{z -i})

But this might not help unless expanded. Let me try writing z = x + yi and expanding everything again.

Alternatively, maybe notice that (z +i)^2 -3 is a quadratic in z, so the equation represents some quadratic curve. The set of points z where |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i| is likely a circle or an ellipse or hyperbola.

Alternatively, think of this as |(z +i)^2 -3| / |z -i| =2. So the ratio of distances is 2, which resembles the definition of an Apollonius circle. However, typically, Apollonius circle is |z -a| / |z -b| =k, which is a circle. But here, the numerator is |(z +i)^2 -3|, which is not a linear function, so the locus is not a circle. So maybe it&#x27;s a quartic curve.

Given that, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs at one of the points we found on the y-axis. But to confirm, perhaps consider other points.

Alternatively, parameterize the problem with z = ti where t is real. Let me try z = ti, then |z| = |t|. Let&#x27;s check if this satisfies the equation.

z = ti, so z +i = ti +i = (t +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = -(t +1)^2. Then (z +i)^2 -3 = - (t +1)^2 -3. The modulus is | - (t +1)^2 -3 | = (t +1)^2 +3.

On the other side, 2|z -i| =2| ti -i | =2| (t -1)i | =2|t -1|

So the equation becomes (t +1)^2 +3 =2|t -1|

Let me solve this equation.

Case 1: t &gt;=1. Then |t -1|=t -1.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3 =2(t -1)

Expand left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2t -2

So t² +2t +4 =2t -2

t² +6=0. No real solutions.

Case 2: t &lt;1. Then |t -1|=1 -t.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3=2(1 -t)

Left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2 -2t

So t² +2t +4 =2 -2t

t² +4t +2 =0

Solutions: t = [-4 ±sqrt(16 -8)]/2 =[-4 ±sqrt(8)]/2 =[-4 ±2√2]/2= -2 ±√2

So t = -2 +√2≈-0.585 and t=-2 -√2≈-3.414

Check if these are less than1: yes, both are.

So z =ti, so |z| =|t|. So the |z| for these solutions are |-2 +√2|≈0.586 and |-2 -√2|≈3.414. So same as before. So when z is purely imaginary, the minimal |z| is 2 -√2≈0.5857.

But is this the minimal overall? Maybe there are other points not on the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

To check, let&#x27;s suppose that minimal |z| occurs at a point not on the y-axis, so x≠0. To verify, perhaps set y such that the derivative is zero, but given the complexity of the equation, this might be difficult.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal |z| is achieved when z is colinear with the origin and the center of some circle... Wait, but the problem is that the equation is not a circle.

Alternatively, use the triangle inequality. Let me see:

We have |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

Note that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= ||(z +i)^2| -|3|| by the reverse triangle inequality. But not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, expand (z +i)^2 -3:

(z +i)^2 -3 = z² +2i z -1 -3 =z² +2i z -4

So the equation is |z² +2i z -4| =2|z -i|

Hmm, still not helpful. Let me see:

If I let z =0, then |0 +0 -4|=4, and 2|0 -i|=2*1=2. So 4≠2, so z=0 is not a solution.

If z approaches 0, then |z² +2i z -4| ≈4, and 2|z -i|≈2*1=2, so LHS &gt;RHS near z=0. So the minimal |z| must be somewhere else.

Alternatively, consider parametrizing z in terms of |z|. Let me write z = r e^{iθ}, then |z|=r. Then we need to express the equation in terms of r and θ.

But this might be complicated. Let me attempt it.

Express z = r e^{iθ}. Then z +i = r e^{iθ} +i. Let me compute (z +i)^2:

(z +i)^2 = (r e^{iθ} +i)^2 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -1

Therefore, (z +i)^2 -3 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4

So modulus squared is |r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4|² = [r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2

And the right side is 2|z -i| =2| r e^{iθ} -i | =2 sqrt(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

So squaring both sides:

[r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2 =4(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

This equation relates r and θ. To find the minimal r, we can try to analyze this equation.

This looks very involved, but perhaps consider specific angles θ where the equation simplifies.

For instance, let me consider θ = -π/2, which would align z along the negative imaginary axis. Then z = -r i.

Compute left side:

[r² cos(-π) -4]^2 + [r² sin(-π) +2r cos(-π/2)]^2

= [r²*(-1) -4]^2 + [0 +2r*0]^2

= (-r² -4)^2 +0 = (r² +4)^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r*(-1))=4(r² +1 +2r)=4r² +4 +8r

Set equal:

(r² +4)^2 =4r² +8r +4

Expand left: r^4 +8r² +16

So equation: r^4 +8r² +16 =4r² +8r +4

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +4r² -8r +12=0

Not sure if this factors. Testing r=1:1 +4 -8 +12=9≠0

r=2:16 +16 -16 +12=28≠0

No obvious roots. So θ=-π/2 might not yield solutions.

Alternatively, take θ=0, so z is real positive. Then z =r.

Left side:

[r² cos0 -4]^2 +[r² sin0 +2r cos0]^2

= (r² -4)^2 + (0 +2r)^2 = (r² -4)^2 +4r²

Right side:

4(r² +1 -0)=4r² +4

Set equal:

(r² -4)^2 +4r² =4r² +4

Simplify: (r² -4)^2 =4

Take sqrt: r² -4=±2

Case1: r² -4=2 =&gt;r²=6 =&gt;r=√6≈2.449

Case2: r² -4=-2 =&gt;r²=2 =&gt;r=√2≈1.414

So θ=0, solutions at r=√2 and r=√6. So |z|=√2≈1.414 and √6≈2.449. But earlier, on the imaginary axis, we had |z|=2 -√2≈0.586, which is smaller. So these are not minimal.

Alternatively, check θ=π/2, z=ri, but already considered that case.

Alternatively, suppose θ=π/4. Then z = r e^{iπ/4}= r(√2/2 +i√2/2)

Compute left side:

[r² cos(π/2) -4]^2 + [r² sin(π/2) +2r cos(π/4)]^2

= [0 -4]^2 + [r²*1 +2r*(√2/2)]^2

=16 + [r² +√2 r]^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r sin(π/4))=4(r² +1 -2r*(√2/2))=4(r² +1 -√2 r)

Set equal:

16 + (r² +√2 r)^2 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Expand left:

16 +r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r²

Equation:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r² +16 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 -2r² +4√2 r +12=0

This seems difficult to solve. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis, as previously found. To confirm, maybe check another angle.

Alternatively, notice that when we substituted z =ti (i.e., x=0), we found solutions with |z|=2 -√2 and 2 +√2. The smaller one is 2 -√2≈0.5858.

But we need to check if there are any other solutions off the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

Suppose there exists a point z with |z| &lt;2 -√2. Let me assume such a point exists and see if it leads to a contradiction.

Let |z|=r &lt;2 -√2≈0.5858.

But since |z -i| &gt;= | |z| - |i| | = |r -1|. So 2|z -i| &gt;=2(1 -r)

On the other hand, |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= |(z +i)^2| +| -3| = |z +i|² +3. Since |z +i| &lt;=|z| +|i|=r +1. So |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

But we have equality |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So if 2(1 -r) &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

Let me check if this holds for r &lt;2 -√2.

Compute RHS - LHS = (r +1)^2 +3 -2(1 -r)=r² +2r +1 +3 -2 +2r=r² +4r +2

Which is positive for all real r. So this inequality holds for any r, but that doesn&#x27;t give us a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps using other inequalities. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= | |(z +i)^2| - |3| |. Which is | |z +i|² -3 |.

So we have | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;= |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;=2|z -i|

But not sure how helpful this is.

Alternatively, let me assume that the minimal |z| occurs at the point we found on the imaginary axis, 2 -√2≈0.586, and check if there can be any other points with smaller |z|.

Alternatively, note that the equation |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i| can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3|² =4|z -i|², which is the equation we derived earlier. If we assume that the minimal |z| occurs at a point where the gradient is colinear with the position vector, i.e., the point where the curve is tangent to the circle centered at the origin. But calculating this would require using Lagrange multipliers, which is quite involved given the complexity of the equation.

Alternatively, given the earlier solutions on the imaginary axis and given that when minimizing |z|, the closest point might lie on the imaginary axis due to symmetry. Since the equation involves z +i and z -i, which are vertical translations, it&#x27;s possible that the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal value we found is 2 -√2≈0.5858, and since we couldn&#x27;t find any solution with smaller |z|, and given the symmetry, this might be the minimal value.

Therefore, I think the minimal |z| is 2 -√2, achieved when z is on the imaginary axis at z=(-2 +√2)i, so |z|=| -2 +√2 | =2 -√2.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the minimum value of \(|z|\) for complex numbers \(z\) satisfying the equation \(|(z + i)^2 - 3| = 2|z - i|\), we start by substituting \(z = w + i\) where \(w = z - i\). This transforms the equation into \(|(w + 2i)^2 - 3| = 2|w|\).

We then consider \(w = x + yi\) and substitute into the equation. After expanding and simplifying both sides, we find that the equation becomes complex. However, by considering specific cases where \(w\) is purely imaginary (i.e., \(x = 0\)), we simplify the problem.

Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation, we solve for \(y\) and find the roots \(y = -3 \pm \sqrt{2}\). Translating back to \(z\), we get \(z = (-2 + \sqrt{2})i\) and \(z = (-2 - \sqrt{2})i\). The modulus \(|z|\) for these points is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} |\) and \(| -2 - \sqrt{2} |\), respectively.

The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} | = 2 - \sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: First, we rewrite the condition: $|z+i|^2-3=2|z-i|$ $|z+i|^2-3-2|z-i|=0$ $(z+i)^2+z^2+2zi+i^2-3-2z+2i=0$ $z(z+i)-z^2+3=z+2i$. Now, the trick! We complete the quadratic using the discriminant of \(z+2i\) (which is nonzero since \(z\) is complex) resulting in: $z^2(z-1)-z+2+i^2=-z$. This gives the roots: $z=(-1\pm \sqrt{|2|^2-4(-1)(-i)})/2=-i/2\pm i/2$ So \(z=-i/2\). $|z+i|^2 = |\frac z2+i|^2=\frac{|z|^2-iz/z-\bar i z/\bar z-|\bar i/z|^2}{4}$ $|\frac z2+i|^2=\frac{|z/2-z\bar i|^2 - |\bar i|^2}{4}$ $|\frac z2+i|^2=\frac{|z/2|^2+|z\bar i|^2}{4}=\frac{|z/2|^2+|\bar i|^2}{4}$ $|\frac z2+i|^2=\frac{|z/2|^2+1}{4}=\frac{|z/2+i|^2-\Re z/2}{4}$ $|\frac z2+i|^2+|\Re z/2|=\frac{2|\Re z/2|}{4}=\Re z/2$ so $|\Re z/2|=\Re z/2$ $|\Re z/2|=|\Re z/2+i(-2)^2|=|\Re z/2|$. So $|\Re z/2|=|\bar z/2|$, so $\Re z=\Re z^3$, so \(z\) must be real. So, the minimum is 0. \boxed{0}

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The question is asking for the minimum value of |z| where z is a complex number that satisfies the equation |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Hmm, complex numbers and modulus... I remember that complex numbers can be represented in the complex plane, so maybe I can translate this equation into geometric terms?

First, let me recall that for a complex number z = x + yi, |z| is the modulus, which is √(x² + y²). So |z| represents the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) in the plane. The problem wants the minimum such distance among all z that satisfy the given equation.

The equation given is |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Let me try to break this down. Let&#x27;s substitute z = x + yi into the equation. Then z + i = x + (y + 1)i. Squaring that gives (x + (y + 1)i)². Let me compute that:

(x + (y + 1)i)² = x² + 2x(y + 1)i + [(y + 1)i]²
= x² + 2x(y + 1)i - (y + 1)²
= (x² - (y + 1)²) + 2x(y + 1)i

So (z + i)² - 3 would be [(x² - (y + 1)²) - 3] + 2x(y + 1)i. Then the modulus of this is equal to 2|z - i|. Let&#x27;s compute both sides.

Left side modulus: sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side: 2|z - i| = 2| x + (y - 1)i | = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

So, the equation becomes:

sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²] = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

Hmm, that looks complicated. Maybe squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots would help. Let me try that.

Left side squared: [(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side squared: 4(x² + (y - 1)²)

So expanding the left side:

First, let me denote A = x² - (y + 1)² - 3, and B = 2x(y + 1). Then the left side squared is A² + B².

Compute A²:

[x² - (y + 1)² - 3]^2

Let me expand (y + 1)² first: y² + 2y + 1. So x² - (y² + 2y + 1) - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 1 - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 4.

Therefore, A = x² - y² - 2y - 4, so A² = (x² - y² - 2y - 4)²

Similarly, B = 2x(y + 1), so B² = 4x²(y + 1)²

So left side squared becomes:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4(x² + (y - 1)^2)

Let me expand the right side:

4(x² + y² - 2y + 1) = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

So now, the equation is:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

Hmm, this seems really messy. Maybe there&#x27;s a better way to approach this problem instead of expanding everything. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let w = z - i. Then z = w + i. Let me substitute that into the original equation.

So, |(w + i + i)² - 3| = 2|w + i - i| =&gt; |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

Maybe this substitution simplifies things. Let&#x27;s denote w = a + bi. Then w + 2i = a + (b + 2)i. Then (w + 2i)² is [a + (b + 2)i]² = a² + 2a(b + 2)i + [(b + 2)i]^2 = a² + 2a(b + 2)i - (b + 2)^2

So (w + 2i)^2 - 3 = [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3] + 2a(b + 2)i

Then the modulus squared is [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4|w|^2 = 4(a² + b²)

So expanding the left side:

[a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4(a² + b²)

Let me compute [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2. First, expand (b + 2)^2: b² + 4b + 4. So a² - b² -4b -4 -3 = a² - b² -4b -7. So the first term is (a² - b² -4b -7)^2.

Second term: [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4a²(b + 2)^2

So left side becomes:

(a² - b² -4b -7)^2 + 4a²(b + 2)^2 = 4a² + 4b²

This still seems complicated, but maybe expanding the left side will lead to some cancellation.

First, let&#x27;s expand (a² - b² -4b -7)^2:

= (a²)^2 + (-b² -4b -7)^2 + 2a²(-b² -4b -7)

= a^4 + (b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b² + 56b) + (-2a²b² -8a²b -14a²)

Wait, that&#x27;s a bit messy. Let me do it step by step.

Let me denote C = a² and D = -b² -4b -7. Then (C + D)^2 = C² + 2CD + D².

C² = (a²)^2 = a^4

2CD = 2a²(-b² -4b -7) = -2a²b² -8a²b -14a²

D² = (-b² -4b -7)^2. Let&#x27;s compute that:

= (b² +4b +7)^2

= (b²)^2 + (4b)^2 + (7)^2 + 2*b²*4b + 2*b²*7 + 2*4b*7

= b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b^2 + 56b

= b^4 + 8b^3 + (16b^2 +14b^2) +56b +49

= b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So D² = b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So putting it all together, (a² - b² -4b -7)^2 = a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, adding the second term: 4a²(b + 2)^2

First compute (b + 2)^2 = b² +4b +4. Then 4a²*(b² +4b +4) = 4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

So the entire left side becomes:

a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 +4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

a^4: a^4

a²b² terms: -2a²b² +4a²b² = 2a²b²

a²b terms: -8a²b +16a²b = 8a²b

a² terms: -14a² +16a² = 2a²

b^4: b^4

b^3:8b^3

b^2:30b^2

b terms:56b

constants:49

So left side simplifies to:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, the right side is 4a² +4b²

Therefore, the equation is:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 = 4a² +4b²

Bringing all terms to the left side:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 -4a² -4b² =0

Simplify:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b + (2a² -4a²) + b^4 +8b^3 + (30b^2 -4b^2) +56b +49 =0

Which simplifies to:

a^4 +2a²b² +8a²b -2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +26b^2 +56b +49=0

Hmm, this still looks quite complicated. Maybe there&#x27;s a different approach here. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z - i|

Perhaps instead of substituting z = x + yi, I can interpret this geometrically. Let me recall that for complex numbers, |A - B| represents the distance between points A and B in the complex plane.

But here, the equation is |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Hmm, that&#x27;s not a straightforward distance. Alternatively, maybe I can see (z + i)^2 as some transformation of z. Squaring a complex number can be seen as a geometric transformation: squaring the modulus and doubling the angle. But I&#x27;m not sure how that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe set w = z + i, so z = w - i. Then the equation becomes |w² - 3| = 2|w - 2i|

But maybe this substitution can help. Let me check:

Original substitution: z = w - i, so z + i = w, and z - i = w - 2i. Then the equation |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

So we have |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Maybe this is easier to handle. Let me denote w = a + bi. Then w² = (a + bi)^2 = a² - b² + 2abi. Then w² - 3 = (a² - b² -3) + 2abi. The modulus of this is sqrt[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] and the right side is 2*sqrt[a² + (b - 2)^2]. Then squaring both sides:

[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] = 4[a² + (b -2)^2]

But this seems similar to the previous approach. Maybe expanding this will lead to the same equation.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a parametrization or polar coordinates. Let me try that. Let me set w = r e^{iθ}, where r = |w|, θ is the argument.

Then |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Expressing in polar coordinates:

|r² e^{i2θ} -3| = 2 | r e^{iθ} - 2i|

But this might not lead to an easy equation either. Let me compute both sides.

Left side modulus: |r² e^{i2θ} -3|. This is the distance from the point (r² cos 2θ, r² sin 2θ) to (3, 0).

Right side: 2|r e^{iθ} - 2i| = 2| (r cos θ) + i(r sin θ - 2)| = 2 sqrt[ (r cos θ)^2 + (r sin θ -2)^2 ]

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps consider specific points. For example, if z is real, then z = x, so y =0. Then compute if that satisfies the equation.

But maybe that&#x27;s too restrictive. The minimum |z| might not occur on the real axis. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus. Let me consider that |z| is the distance from the origin, and we need to minimize this distance subject to the constraint |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. So this is an optimization problem with a constraint. Maybe Lagrange multipliers?

Yes, that&#x27;s a possible approach. Let me try that.

Let me denote z = x + yi. Then |z| = sqrt(x² + y²). We need to minimize x² + y² (since sqrt is increasing, minimizing sqrt(x² + y²) is equivalent to minimizing x² + y²).

The constraint is |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0. Let me denote f(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

So using Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of the objective function and the constraint should be proportional.

The objective function is F(x, y) = x² + y².

The constraint is G(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

Compute ∇F = [2x, 2y]

Compute ∇G. This is a bit involved, but let&#x27;s recall that for a function G(x,y) = |A(x, y)| - |B(x, y)|, the gradient is (∇|A| - ∇|B|). So need to compute gradients of |(z +i)^2 -3| and 2|z -i|.

Let me first compute |(z +i)^2 -3|.

Let me denote A = (z +i)^2 -3. Then |A| is modulus of A.

Express A in terms of x and y. As earlier, z = x + yi, so z +i = x + (y +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = x² - (y +1)^2 + 2x(y +1)i. Then subtract 3: [x² - (y +1)^2 -3] + 2x(y +1)i. So A = u + vi where u = x² - (y +1)^2 -3 and v = 2x(y +1).

Thus, |A| = sqrt(u² + v²). The gradient of |A| is ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) )

Similarly, |B| where B = z -i = x + (y -1)i, so |B| = sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2). The gradient of |B| is (x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2), (y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2))

Therefore, gradient of G = ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*(x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*((y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)) )

This seems very complicated, but maybe at the minimal point, there is some symmetry or simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps parameterizing the problem. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|

Let me let z -i = w. Then z = w + i. Then z + i = w + 2i. So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)^2 -3| = 2|w|

So |w² +4i w -4 -3| =2|w|, since (w + 2i)^2 = w² +4i w + (2i)^2 = w² +4i w -4. Then subtract 3: w² +4i w -7.

Thus, |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|

Hmm, maybe if I write this as |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|, perhaps dividing both sides by |w| (assuming w ≠0):

| w +4i -7/w | =2

But not sure if this helps. Let me check:

If w ≠0, then divide both sides by |w|:

| (w² +4i w -7)/w | =2 =&gt; |w +4i -7/w| =2

But this might not necessarily help. Alternatively, set t = w, then |t² +4i t -7| =2|t|. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |t² +4i t -7|² =4|t|²

So (t² +4i t -7)(\overline{t² +4i t -7}) =4|t|²

But this is getting too algebraic. Let me try to write t as x + yi.

Let t = x + yi. Then t² = (x + yi)^2 = x² - y² + 2xyi

4i t =4i(x + yi) = -4y +4x i

So t² +4i t -7 = (x² - y² -4y -7) + (2xy +4x)i

Thus, modulus squared is (x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4(x² + y²)

So equation:

(x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4x² +4y²

Wait, this is the same equation I had earlier when substituting w = t = z -i. So seems like we end up at the same quartic equation. Maybe expanding is the way to go.

Let me try expanding the left side:

First term: (x² - y² -4y -7)^2

Let me expand this:

= (x²)^2 + (-y² -4y -7)^2 + 2x²*(-y² -4y -7)

= x^4 + (y^4 +16y² +49 +8y^3 +14y² +56y) + (-2x²y² -8x²y -14x²)

Wait, similar to before:

Wait, (-y² -4y -7)^2 = (y² +4y +7)^2 = y^4 +8y^3 + (16y² +14y²) +56y +49 = y^4 +8y^3 +30y^2 +56y +49

And the cross term is 2x²*(-y² -4y -7) = -2x²y² -8x²y -14x²

Second term: (2xy +4x)^2 =4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

So left side total:

x^4 + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -2x²y² -8x²y -14x² +4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

Combine like terms:

x^4 + [y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49] + [(-2x²y² +4x²y²) + (-8x²y +16x²y) + (-14x² +16x²)]

Simplify each group:

x^4 remains.

y terms: y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

x²y² terms: (-2 +4)x²y² =2x²y²

x²y terms: (-8 +16)x²y =8x²y

x² terms: (-14 +16)x² =2x²

So left side becomes:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

Set equal to right side 4x² +4y²:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 =4x² +4y²

Bring all terms to left side:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -4x² -4y²=0

Simplify:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y + (2x² -4x²) + y^4 +8y^3 + (30y² -4y²) +56y +49=0

Which simplifies to:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y -2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

This equation is still very complicated. Maybe factorizing or looking for possible substitutions.

Alternatively, maybe trying specific values. For example, suppose x =0. Then the equation becomes:

0 +0 +0 -0 + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

Which is y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0. Let me check if this has real roots. Hmm, possible rational roots are ±1,±7,±49. Testing y = -1:

1 -8 +26 -56 +49 =12 ≠0

y=-7: (-7)^4 +8*(-7)^3 +26*(-7)^2 +56*(-7) +49=2401 -2744 +1274 -392 +49= 2401 -2744= -343; -343 +1274=931; 931 -392=539; 539 +49=588≠0

Not zero. Maybe it factors into quadratics?

Suppose y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49 = (y² + a y + b)(y² +c y +d)

Multiply out:

y^4 + (a +c)y³ + (ac +b +d)y² + (ad + bc)y + bd

Set coefficients:

a +c=8

ac +b +d=26

ad + bc=56

bd=49

Since bd=49, possible pairs (b,d)=(7,7), (49,1), (-7,-7), etc. Let&#x27;s try positive integers first. 7 and7. Then b=7, d=7.

Then a +c=8

ac +7 +7=26 =&gt; ac=12

ad + bc=56 =&gt;7a +7c=56 =&gt;a +c=8. Which matches the first equation. So from a +c=8 and ac=12. Solving:

a and c are roots of t² -8t +12=0. Which factors as (t -6)(t -2)=0. So a=6, c=2 or a=2, c=6.

Check ad + bc: if a=6, c=2, then 7*6 +7*2=42 +14=56. Yes, works. Similarly if a=2, c=6: 7*2 +7*6=14 +42=56. So works.

Therefore, the quartic factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0

So setting x=0, the equation factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0. The roots would be y = [-6 ±sqrt(36 -28)]/2 = [-6 ±sqrt(8)]/2 = [-6 ±2√2]/2 = -3 ±√2. Similarly for the other quadratic: y = [-2 ±sqrt(4 -28)]/2. But sqrt(-24) is imaginary. So real roots are y = -3 +√2 and y = -3 -√2. But since x=0, then z =0 + yi -i = y -i. Wait, no. Wait, we set t = z -i =w, then x and y are coordinates of w. So z = w +i. If w has x=0, then z =0 + (y +1)i. So |z| = sqrt(0 + (y +1)^2) = |y +1|. The real roots for y are -3 ±√2. So |z| would be | (-3 ±√2 ) +1 | = | -2 ±√2 |. So |-2 +√2| and |-2 -√2|. Since √2≈1.414, so -2 +1.414≈-0.586, absolute value≈0.586. The other is |-2 -1.414|=3.414. So minimum |z| is approximately 0.586 when x=0. But is this the minimal overall? Because maybe when x≠0, we can get a smaller |z|.

But first, let&#x27;s check if these points are indeed solutions. If x=0 and y = -3 +√2, then w =0 + (-3 +√2)i, so z = w +i = (-3 +√2)i +i = (-2 +√2)i. Then |z| = | -2 +√2 | ≈0.586. Similarly, the other root gives |z|=3.414. So perhaps 2 -√2 is approximately0.586, which is 2 -1.414≈0.586.

But the question is whether there are other solutions with x≠0 that have smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal |z| occurs on the y-axis (x=0). Let me check that.

If x=0, then z = (0) + (y +1)i. So |z| is |y +1|. The minimal |y +1| occurs at y = -1, which gives |z|=0. But does y=-1 satisfy the equation? Let&#x27;s check.

If x=0 and y=-1, then w = z -i = (0 + (-1)i) -i = -2i. Then check |(w +2i)^2 -3| = |(-2i +2i)^2 -3| = |0 -3| =3. And 2|w| =2*| -2i | =4. 3≠4, so y=-1 is not a solution.

Wait, but when x=0, we had solutions at y= -3 ±√2. The minimal |z| for x=0 is | -2 +√2 |≈0.586. Let&#x27;s see if we can find a solution with x≠0 that has a smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal occurs at another point. Let me consider that |z| is minimal when z is closest to the origin on the curve defined by |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Maybe this curve is a circle or some conic section.

Alternatively, notice that the original equation can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Let me consider squaring both sides:

|(z +i)^2 -3|² = 4|z -i|²

Which can be written as [(z +i)^2 -3][\overline{(z +i)^2 -3}] =4(z -i)(\overline{z -i})

But this might not help unless expanded. Let me try writing z = x + yi and expanding everything again.

Alternatively, maybe notice that (z +i)^2 -3 is a quadratic in z, so the equation represents some quadratic curve. The set of points z where |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i| is likely a circle or an ellipse or hyperbola.

Alternatively, think of this as |(z +i)^2 -3| / |z -i| =2. So the ratio of distances is 2, which resembles the definition of an Apollonius circle. However, typically, Apollonius circle is |z -a| / |z -b| =k, which is a circle. But here, the numerator is |(z +i)^2 -3|, which is not a linear function, so the locus is not a circle. So maybe it&#x27;s a quartic curve.

Given that, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs at one of the points we found on the y-axis. But to confirm, perhaps consider other points.

Alternatively, parameterize the problem with z = ti where t is real. Let me try z = ti, then |z| = |t|. Let&#x27;s check if this satisfies the equation.

z = ti, so z +i = ti +i = (t +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = -(t +1)^2. Then (z +i)^2 -3 = - (t +1)^2 -3. The modulus is | - (t +1)^2 -3 | = (t +1)^2 +3.

On the other side, 2|z -i| =2| ti -i | =2| (t -1)i | =2|t -1|

So the equation becomes (t +1)^2 +3 =2|t -1|

Let me solve this equation.

Case 1: t &gt;=1. Then |t -1|=t -1.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3 =2(t -1)

Expand left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2t -2

So t² +2t +4 =2t -2

t² +6=0. No real solutions.

Case 2: t &lt;1. Then |t -1|=1 -t.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3=2(1 -t)

Left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2 -2t

So t² +2t +4 =2 -2t

t² +4t +2 =0

Solutions: t = [-4 ±sqrt(16 -8)]/2 =[-4 ±sqrt(8)]/2 =[-4 ±2√2]/2= -2 ±√2

So t = -2 +√2≈-0.585 and t=-2 -√2≈-3.414

Check if these are less than1: yes, both are.

So z =ti, so |z| =|t|. So the |z| for these solutions are |-2 +√2|≈0.586 and |-2 -√2|≈3.414. So same as before. So when z is purely imaginary, the minimal |z| is 2 -√2≈0.5857.

But is this the minimal overall? Maybe there are other points not on the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

To check, let&#x27;s suppose that minimal |z| occurs at a point not on the y-axis, so x≠0. To verify, perhaps set y such that the derivative is zero, but given the complexity of the equation, this might be difficult.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal |z| is achieved when z is colinear with the origin and the center of some circle... Wait, but the problem is that the equation is not a circle.

Alternatively, use the triangle inequality. Let me see:

We have |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

Note that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= ||(z +i)^2| -|3|| by the reverse triangle inequality. But not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, expand (z +i)^2 -3:

(z +i)^2 -3 = z² +2i z -1 -3 =z² +2i z -4

So the equation is |z² +2i z -4| =2|z -i|

Hmm, still not helpful. Let me see:

If I let z =0, then |0 +0 -4|=4, and 2|0 -i|=2*1=2. So 4≠2, so z=0 is not a solution.

If z approaches 0, then |z² +2i z -4| ≈4, and 2|z -i|≈2*1=2, so LHS &gt;RHS near z=0. So the minimal |z| must be somewhere else.

Alternatively, consider parametrizing z in terms of |z|. Let me write z = r e^{iθ}, then |z|=r. Then we need to express the equation in terms of r and θ.

But this might be complicated. Let me attempt it.

Express z = r e^{iθ}. Then z +i = r e^{iθ} +i. Let me compute (z +i)^2:

(z +i)^2 = (r e^{iθ} +i)^2 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -1

Therefore, (z +i)^2 -3 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4

So modulus squared is |r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4|² = [r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2

And the right side is 2|z -i| =2| r e^{iθ} -i | =2 sqrt(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

So squaring both sides:

[r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2 =4(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

This equation relates r and θ. To find the minimal r, we can try to analyze this equation.

This looks very involved, but perhaps consider specific angles θ where the equation simplifies.

For instance, let me consider θ = -π/2, which would align z along the negative imaginary axis. Then z = -r i.

Compute left side:

[r² cos(-π) -4]^2 + [r² sin(-π) +2r cos(-π/2)]^2

= [r²*(-1) -4]^2 + [0 +2r*0]^2

= (-r² -4)^2 +0 = (r² +4)^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r*(-1))=4(r² +1 +2r)=4r² +4 +8r

Set equal:

(r² +4)^2 =4r² +8r +4

Expand left: r^4 +8r² +16

So equation: r^4 +8r² +16 =4r² +8r +4

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +4r² -8r +12=0

Not sure if this factors. Testing r=1:1 +4 -8 +12=9≠0

r=2:16 +16 -16 +12=28≠0

No obvious roots. So θ=-π/2 might not yield solutions.

Alternatively, take θ=0, so z is real positive. Then z =r.

Left side:

[r² cos0 -4]^2 +[r² sin0 +2r cos0]^2

= (r² -4)^2 + (0 +2r)^2 = (r² -4)^2 +4r²

Right side:

4(r² +1 -0)=4r² +4

Set equal:

(r² -4)^2 +4r² =4r² +4

Simplify: (r² -4)^2 =4

Take sqrt: r² -4=±2

Case1: r² -4=2 =&gt;r²=6 =&gt;r=√6≈2.449

Case2: r² -4=-2 =&gt;r²=2 =&gt;r=√2≈1.414

So θ=0, solutions at r=√2 and r=√6. So |z|=√2≈1.414 and √6≈2.449. But earlier, on the imaginary axis, we had |z|=2 -√2≈0.586, which is smaller. So these are not minimal.

Alternatively, check θ=π/2, z=ri, but already considered that case.

Alternatively, suppose θ=π/4. Then z = r e^{iπ/4}= r(√2/2 +i√2/2)

Compute left side:

[r² cos(π/2) -4]^2 + [r² sin(π/2) +2r cos(π/4)]^2

= [0 -4]^2 + [r²*1 +2r*(√2/2)]^2

=16 + [r² +√2 r]^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r sin(π/4))=4(r² +1 -2r*(√2/2))=4(r² +1 -√2 r)

Set equal:

16 + (r² +√2 r)^2 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Expand left:

16 +r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r²

Equation:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r² +16 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 -2r² +4√2 r +12=0

This seems difficult to solve. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis, as previously found. To confirm, maybe check another angle.

Alternatively, notice that when we substituted z =ti (i.e., x=0), we found solutions with |z|=2 -√2 and 2 +√2. The smaller one is 2 -√2≈0.5858.

But we need to check if there are any other solutions off the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

Suppose there exists a point z with |z| &lt;2 -√2. Let me assume such a point exists and see if it leads to a contradiction.

Let |z|=r &lt;2 -√2≈0.5858.

But since |z -i| &gt;= | |z| - |i| | = |r -1|. So 2|z -i| &gt;=2(1 -r)

On the other hand, |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= |(z +i)^2| +| -3| = |z +i|² +3. Since |z +i| &lt;=|z| +|i|=r +1. So |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

But we have equality |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So if 2(1 -r) &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

Let me check if this holds for r &lt;2 -√2.

Compute RHS - LHS = (r +1)^2 +3 -2(1 -r)=r² +2r +1 +3 -2 +2r=r² +4r +2

Which is positive for all real r. So this inequality holds for any r, but that doesn&#x27;t give us a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps using other inequalities. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= | |(z +i)^2| - |3| |. Which is | |z +i|² -3 |.

So we have | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;= |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;=2|z -i|

But not sure how helpful this is.

Alternatively, let me assume that the minimal |z| occurs at the point we found on the imaginary axis, 2 -√2≈0.586, and check if there can be any other points with smaller |z|.

Alternatively, note that the equation |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i| can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3|² =4|z -i|², which is the equation we derived earlier. If we assume that the minimal |z| occurs at a point where the gradient is colinear with the position vector, i.e., the point where the curve is tangent to the circle centered at the origin. But calculating this would require using Lagrange multipliers, which is quite involved given the complexity of the equation.

Alternatively, given the earlier solutions on the imaginary axis and given that when minimizing |z|, the closest point might lie on the imaginary axis due to symmetry. Since the equation involves z +i and z -i, which are vertical translations, it&#x27;s possible that the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal value we found is 2 -√2≈0.5858, and since we couldn&#x27;t find any solution with smaller |z|, and given the symmetry, this might be the minimal value.

Therefore, I think the minimal |z| is 2 -√2, achieved when z is on the imaginary axis at z=(-2 +√2)i, so |z|=| -2 +√2 | =2 -√2.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the minimum value of \(|z|\) for complex numbers \(z\) satisfying the equation \(|(z + i)^2 - 3| = 2|z - i|\), we start by substituting \(z = w + i\) where \(w = z - i\). This transforms the equation into \(|(w + 2i)^2 - 3| = 2|w|\).

We then consider \(w = x + yi\) and substitute into the equation. After expanding and simplifying both sides, we find that the equation becomes complex. However, by considering specific cases where \(w\) is purely imaginary (i.e., \(x = 0\)), we simplify the problem.

Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation, we solve for \(y\) and find the roots \(y = -3 \pm \sqrt{2}\). Translating back to \(z\), we get \(z = (-2 + \sqrt{2})i\) and \(z = (-2 - \sqrt{2})i\). The modulus \(|z|\) for these points is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} |\) and \(| -2 - \sqrt{2} |\), respectively.

The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} | = 2 - \sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).          </p>

Response: Factoring \(|z+i|^2\) and \(|z- (i)|\), we can simplify the equation as \(4|z|^2-\bar{z}^2 = 6|z|\). We divide all four sides by 4, giving us \(|z|^2-\frac{1}{4}\bar{z}^2 = \frac{3}{2}|z|\). This yields \(|z|^2-\frac{1}{4}|z|^2 = \frac{3}{2}|z|\), and so \(|z|^2 - |z|^2 = \frac{3}{2}|z|\). We get \(|z|^2 = \frac{3}{2}|z|\), which is to say \(|z| = \dfrac{3}{2}\). \boxed{1.5}

Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The question is asking for the minimum value of |z| where z is a complex number that satisfies the equation |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Hmm, complex numbers and modulus... I remember that complex numbers can be represented in the complex plane, so maybe I can translate this equation into geometric terms?

First, let me recall that for a complex number z = x + yi, |z| is the modulus, which is √(x² + y²). So |z| represents the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) in the plane. The problem wants the minimum such distance among all z that satisfy the given equation.

The equation given is |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Let me try to break this down. Let&#x27;s substitute z = x + yi into the equation. Then z + i = x + (y + 1)i. Squaring that gives (x + (y + 1)i)². Let me compute that:

(x + (y + 1)i)² = x² + 2x(y + 1)i + [(y + 1)i]²
= x² + 2x(y + 1)i - (y + 1)²
= (x² - (y + 1)²) + 2x(y + 1)i

So (z + i)² - 3 would be [(x² - (y + 1)²) - 3] + 2x(y + 1)i. Then the modulus of this is equal to 2|z - i|. Let&#x27;s compute both sides.

Left side modulus: sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side: 2|z - i| = 2| x + (y - 1)i | = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

So, the equation becomes:

sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²] = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

Hmm, that looks complicated. Maybe squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots would help. Let me try that.

Left side squared: [(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side squared: 4(x² + (y - 1)²)

So expanding the left side:

First, let me denote A = x² - (y + 1)² - 3, and B = 2x(y + 1). Then the left side squared is A² + B².

Compute A²:

[x² - (y + 1)² - 3]^2

Let me expand (y + 1)² first: y² + 2y + 1. So x² - (y² + 2y + 1) - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 1 - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 4.

Therefore, A = x² - y² - 2y - 4, so A² = (x² - y² - 2y - 4)²

Similarly, B = 2x(y + 1), so B² = 4x²(y + 1)²

So left side squared becomes:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4(x² + (y - 1)^2)

Let me expand the right side:

4(x² + y² - 2y + 1) = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

So now, the equation is:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

Hmm, this seems really messy. Maybe there&#x27;s a better way to approach this problem instead of expanding everything. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let w = z - i. Then z = w + i. Let me substitute that into the original equation.

So, |(w + i + i)² - 3| = 2|w + i - i| =&gt; |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

Maybe this substitution simplifies things. Let&#x27;s denote w = a + bi. Then w + 2i = a + (b + 2)i. Then (w + 2i)² is [a + (b + 2)i]² = a² + 2a(b + 2)i + [(b + 2)i]^2 = a² + 2a(b + 2)i - (b + 2)^2

So (w + 2i)^2 - 3 = [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3] + 2a(b + 2)i

Then the modulus squared is [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4|w|^2 = 4(a² + b²)

So expanding the left side:

[a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4(a² + b²)

Let me compute [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2. First, expand (b + 2)^2: b² + 4b + 4. So a² - b² -4b -4 -3 = a² - b² -4b -7. So the first term is (a² - b² -4b -7)^2.

Second term: [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4a²(b + 2)^2

So left side becomes:

(a² - b² -4b -7)^2 + 4a²(b + 2)^2 = 4a² + 4b²

This still seems complicated, but maybe expanding the left side will lead to some cancellation.

First, let&#x27;s expand (a² - b² -4b -7)^2:

= (a²)^2 + (-b² -4b -7)^2 + 2a²(-b² -4b -7)

= a^4 + (b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b² + 56b) + (-2a²b² -8a²b -14a²)

Wait, that&#x27;s a bit messy. Let me do it step by step.

Let me denote C = a² and D = -b² -4b -7. Then (C + D)^2 = C² + 2CD + D².

C² = (a²)^2 = a^4

2CD = 2a²(-b² -4b -7) = -2a²b² -8a²b -14a²

D² = (-b² -4b -7)^2. Let&#x27;s compute that:

= (b² +4b +7)^2

= (b²)^2 + (4b)^2 + (7)^2 + 2*b²*4b + 2*b²*7 + 2*4b*7

= b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b^2 + 56b

= b^4 + 8b^3 + (16b^2 +14b^2) +56b +49

= b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So D² = b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So putting it all together, (a² - b² -4b -7)^2 = a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, adding the second term: 4a²(b + 2)^2

First compute (b + 2)^2 = b² +4b +4. Then 4a²*(b² +4b +4) = 4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

So the entire left side becomes:

a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 +4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

a^4: a^4

a²b² terms: -2a²b² +4a²b² = 2a²b²

a²b terms: -8a²b +16a²b = 8a²b

a² terms: -14a² +16a² = 2a²

b^4: b^4

b^3:8b^3

b^2:30b^2

b terms:56b

constants:49

So left side simplifies to:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, the right side is 4a² +4b²

Therefore, the equation is:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 = 4a² +4b²

Bringing all terms to the left side:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 -4a² -4b² =0

Simplify:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b + (2a² -4a²) + b^4 +8b^3 + (30b^2 -4b^2) +56b +49 =0

Which simplifies to:

a^4 +2a²b² +8a²b -2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +26b^2 +56b +49=0

Hmm, this still looks quite complicated. Maybe there&#x27;s a different approach here. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z - i|

Perhaps instead of substituting z = x + yi, I can interpret this geometrically. Let me recall that for complex numbers, |A - B| represents the distance between points A and B in the complex plane.

But here, the equation is |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Hmm, that&#x27;s not a straightforward distance. Alternatively, maybe I can see (z + i)^2 as some transformation of z. Squaring a complex number can be seen as a geometric transformation: squaring the modulus and doubling the angle. But I&#x27;m not sure how that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe set w = z + i, so z = w - i. Then the equation becomes |w² - 3| = 2|w - 2i|

But maybe this substitution can help. Let me check:

Original substitution: z = w - i, so z + i = w, and z - i = w - 2i. Then the equation |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

So we have |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Maybe this is easier to handle. Let me denote w = a + bi. Then w² = (a + bi)^2 = a² - b² + 2abi. Then w² - 3 = (a² - b² -3) + 2abi. The modulus of this is sqrt[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] and the right side is 2*sqrt[a² + (b - 2)^2]. Then squaring both sides:

[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] = 4[a² + (b -2)^2]

But this seems similar to the previous approach. Maybe expanding this will lead to the same equation.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a parametrization or polar coordinates. Let me try that. Let me set w = r e^{iθ}, where r = |w|, θ is the argument.

Then |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Expressing in polar coordinates:

|r² e^{i2θ} -3| = 2 | r e^{iθ} - 2i|

But this might not lead to an easy equation either. Let me compute both sides.

Left side modulus: |r² e^{i2θ} -3|. This is the distance from the point (r² cos 2θ, r² sin 2θ) to (3, 0).

Right side: 2|r e^{iθ} - 2i| = 2| (r cos θ) + i(r sin θ - 2)| = 2 sqrt[ (r cos θ)^2 + (r sin θ -2)^2 ]

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps consider specific points. For example, if z is real, then z = x, so y =0. Then compute if that satisfies the equation.

But maybe that&#x27;s too restrictive. The minimum |z| might not occur on the real axis. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus. Let me consider that |z| is the distance from the origin, and we need to minimize this distance subject to the constraint |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. So this is an optimization problem with a constraint. Maybe Lagrange multipliers?

Yes, that&#x27;s a possible approach. Let me try that.

Let me denote z = x + yi. Then |z| = sqrt(x² + y²). We need to minimize x² + y² (since sqrt is increasing, minimizing sqrt(x² + y²) is equivalent to minimizing x² + y²).

The constraint is |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0. Let me denote f(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

So using Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of the objective function and the constraint should be proportional.

The objective function is F(x, y) = x² + y².

The constraint is G(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

Compute ∇F = [2x, 2y]

Compute ∇G. This is a bit involved, but let&#x27;s recall that for a function G(x,y) = |A(x, y)| - |B(x, y)|, the gradient is (∇|A| - ∇|B|). So need to compute gradients of |(z +i)^2 -3| and 2|z -i|.

Let me first compute |(z +i)^2 -3|.

Let me denote A = (z +i)^2 -3. Then |A| is modulus of A.

Express A in terms of x and y. As earlier, z = x + yi, so z +i = x + (y +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = x² - (y +1)^2 + 2x(y +1)i. Then subtract 3: [x² - (y +1)^2 -3] + 2x(y +1)i. So A = u + vi where u = x² - (y +1)^2 -3 and v = 2x(y +1).

Thus, |A| = sqrt(u² + v²). The gradient of |A| is ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) )

Similarly, |B| where B = z -i = x + (y -1)i, so |B| = sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2). The gradient of |B| is (x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2), (y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2))

Therefore, gradient of G = ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*(x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*((y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)) )

This seems very complicated, but maybe at the minimal point, there is some symmetry or simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps parameterizing the problem. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|

Let me let z -i = w. Then z = w + i. Then z + i = w + 2i. So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)^2 -3| = 2|w|

So |w² +4i w -4 -3| =2|w|, since (w + 2i)^2 = w² +4i w + (2i)^2 = w² +4i w -4. Then subtract 3: w² +4i w -7.

Thus, |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|

Hmm, maybe if I write this as |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|, perhaps dividing both sides by |w| (assuming w ≠0):

| w +4i -7/w | =2

But not sure if this helps. Let me check:

If w ≠0, then divide both sides by |w|:

| (w² +4i w -7)/w | =2 =&gt; |w +4i -7/w| =2

But this might not necessarily help. Alternatively, set t = w, then |t² +4i t -7| =2|t|. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |t² +4i t -7|² =4|t|²

So (t² +4i t -7)(\overline{t² +4i t -7}) =4|t|²

But this is getting too algebraic. Let me try to write t as x + yi.

Let t = x + yi. Then t² = (x + yi)^2 = x² - y² + 2xyi

4i t =4i(x + yi) = -4y +4x i

So t² +4i t -7 = (x² - y² -4y -7) + (2xy +4x)i

Thus, modulus squared is (x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4(x² + y²)

So equation:

(x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4x² +4y²

Wait, this is the same equation I had earlier when substituting w = t = z -i. So seems like we end up at the same quartic equation. Maybe expanding is the way to go.

Let me try expanding the left side:

First term: (x² - y² -4y -7)^2

Let me expand this:

= (x²)^2 + (-y² -4y -7)^2 + 2x²*(-y² -4y -7)

= x^4 + (y^4 +16y² +49 +8y^3 +14y² +56y) + (-2x²y² -8x²y -14x²)

Wait, similar to before:

Wait, (-y² -4y -7)^2 = (y² +4y +7)^2 = y^4 +8y^3 + (16y² +14y²) +56y +49 = y^4 +8y^3 +30y^2 +56y +49

And the cross term is 2x²*(-y² -4y -7) = -2x²y² -8x²y -14x²

Second term: (2xy +4x)^2 =4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

So left side total:

x^4 + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -2x²y² -8x²y -14x² +4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

Combine like terms:

x^4 + [y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49] + [(-2x²y² +4x²y²) + (-8x²y +16x²y) + (-14x² +16x²)]

Simplify each group:

x^4 remains.

y terms: y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

x²y² terms: (-2 +4)x²y² =2x²y²

x²y terms: (-8 +16)x²y =8x²y

x² terms: (-14 +16)x² =2x²

So left side becomes:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

Set equal to right side 4x² +4y²:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 =4x² +4y²

Bring all terms to left side:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -4x² -4y²=0

Simplify:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y + (2x² -4x²) + y^4 +8y^3 + (30y² -4y²) +56y +49=0

Which simplifies to:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y -2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

This equation is still very complicated. Maybe factorizing or looking for possible substitutions.

Alternatively, maybe trying specific values. For example, suppose x =0. Then the equation becomes:

0 +0 +0 -0 + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

Which is y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0. Let me check if this has real roots. Hmm, possible rational roots are ±1,±7,±49. Testing y = -1:

1 -8 +26 -56 +49 =12 ≠0

y=-7: (-7)^4 +8*(-7)^3 +26*(-7)^2 +56*(-7) +49=2401 -2744 +1274 -392 +49= 2401 -2744= -343; -343 +1274=931; 931 -392=539; 539 +49=588≠0

Not zero. Maybe it factors into quadratics?

Suppose y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49 = (y² + a y + b)(y² +c y +d)

Multiply out:

y^4 + (a +c)y³ + (ac +b +d)y² + (ad + bc)y + bd

Set coefficients:

a +c=8

ac +b +d=26

ad + bc=56

bd=49

Since bd=49, possible pairs (b,d)=(7,7), (49,1), (-7,-7), etc. Let&#x27;s try positive integers first. 7 and7. Then b=7, d=7.

Then a +c=8

ac +7 +7=26 =&gt; ac=12

ad + bc=56 =&gt;7a +7c=56 =&gt;a +c=8. Which matches the first equation. So from a +c=8 and ac=12. Solving:

a and c are roots of t² -8t +12=0. Which factors as (t -6)(t -2)=0. So a=6, c=2 or a=2, c=6.

Check ad + bc: if a=6, c=2, then 7*6 +7*2=42 +14=56. Yes, works. Similarly if a=2, c=6: 7*2 +7*6=14 +42=56. So works.

Therefore, the quartic factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0

So setting x=0, the equation factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0. The roots would be y = [-6 ±sqrt(36 -28)]/2 = [-6 ±sqrt(8)]/2 = [-6 ±2√2]/2 = -3 ±√2. Similarly for the other quadratic: y = [-2 ±sqrt(4 -28)]/2. But sqrt(-24) is imaginary. So real roots are y = -3 +√2 and y = -3 -√2. But since x=0, then z =0 + yi -i = y -i. Wait, no. Wait, we set t = z -i =w, then x and y are coordinates of w. So z = w +i. If w has x=0, then z =0 + (y +1)i. So |z| = sqrt(0 + (y +1)^2) = |y +1|. The real roots for y are -3 ±√2. So |z| would be | (-3 ±√2 ) +1 | = | -2 ±√2 |. So |-2 +√2| and |-2 -√2|. Since √2≈1.414, so -2 +1.414≈-0.586, absolute value≈0.586. The other is |-2 -1.414|=3.414. So minimum |z| is approximately 0.586 when x=0. But is this the minimal overall? Because maybe when x≠0, we can get a smaller |z|.

But first, let&#x27;s check if these points are indeed solutions. If x=0 and y = -3 +√2, then w =0 + (-3 +√2)i, so z = w +i = (-3 +√2)i +i = (-2 +√2)i. Then |z| = | -2 +√2 | ≈0.586. Similarly, the other root gives |z|=3.414. So perhaps 2 -√2 is approximately0.586, which is 2 -1.414≈0.586.

But the question is whether there are other solutions with x≠0 that have smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal |z| occurs on the y-axis (x=0). Let me check that.

If x=0, then z = (0) + (y +1)i. So |z| is |y +1|. The minimal |y +1| occurs at y = -1, which gives |z|=0. But does y=-1 satisfy the equation? Let&#x27;s check.

If x=0 and y=-1, then w = z -i = (0 + (-1)i) -i = -2i. Then check |(w +2i)^2 -3| = |(-2i +2i)^2 -3| = |0 -3| =3. And 2|w| =2*| -2i | =4. 3≠4, so y=-1 is not a solution.

Wait, but when x=0, we had solutions at y= -3 ±√2. The minimal |z| for x=0 is | -2 +√2 |≈0.586. Let&#x27;s see if we can find a solution with x≠0 that has a smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal occurs at another point. Let me consider that |z| is minimal when z is closest to the origin on the curve defined by |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Maybe this curve is a circle or some conic section.

Alternatively, notice that the original equation can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Let me consider squaring both sides:

|(z +i)^2 -3|² = 4|z -i|²

Which can be written as [(z +i)^2 -3][\overline{(z +i)^2 -3}] =4(z -i)(\overline{z -i})

But this might not help unless expanded. Let me try writing z = x + yi and expanding everything again.

Alternatively, maybe notice that (z +i)^2 -3 is a quadratic in z, so the equation represents some quadratic curve. The set of points z where |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i| is likely a circle or an ellipse or hyperbola.

Alternatively, think of this as |(z +i)^2 -3| / |z -i| =2. So the ratio of distances is 2, which resembles the definition of an Apollonius circle. However, typically, Apollonius circle is |z -a| / |z -b| =k, which is a circle. But here, the numerator is |(z +i)^2 -3|, which is not a linear function, so the locus is not a circle. So maybe it&#x27;s a quartic curve.

Given that, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs at one of the points we found on the y-axis. But to confirm, perhaps consider other points.

Alternatively, parameterize the problem with z = ti where t is real. Let me try z = ti, then |z| = |t|. Let&#x27;s check if this satisfies the equation.

z = ti, so z +i = ti +i = (t +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = -(t +1)^2. Then (z +i)^2 -3 = - (t +1)^2 -3. The modulus is | - (t +1)^2 -3 | = (t +1)^2 +3.

On the other side, 2|z -i| =2| ti -i | =2| (t -1)i | =2|t -1|

So the equation becomes (t +1)^2 +3 =2|t -1|

Let me solve this equation.

Case 1: t &gt;=1. Then |t -1|=t -1.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3 =2(t -1)

Expand left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2t -2

So t² +2t +4 =2t -2

t² +6=0. No real solutions.

Case 2: t &lt;1. Then |t -1|=1 -t.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3=2(1 -t)

Left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2 -2t

So t² +2t +4 =2 -2t

t² +4t +2 =0

Solutions: t = [-4 ±sqrt(16 -8)]/2 =[-4 ±sqrt(8)]/2 =[-4 ±2√2]/2= -2 ±√2

So t = -2 +√2≈-0.585 and t=-2 -√2≈-3.414

Check if these are less than1: yes, both are.

So z =ti, so |z| =|t|. So the |z| for these solutions are |-2 +√2|≈0.586 and |-2 -√2|≈3.414. So same as before. So when z is purely imaginary, the minimal |z| is 2 -√2≈0.5857.

But is this the minimal overall? Maybe there are other points not on the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

To check, let&#x27;s suppose that minimal |z| occurs at a point not on the y-axis, so x≠0. To verify, perhaps set y such that the derivative is zero, but given the complexity of the equation, this might be difficult.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal |z| is achieved when z is colinear with the origin and the center of some circle... Wait, but the problem is that the equation is not a circle.

Alternatively, use the triangle inequality. Let me see:

We have |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

Note that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= ||(z +i)^2| -|3|| by the reverse triangle inequality. But not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, expand (z +i)^2 -3:

(z +i)^2 -3 = z² +2i z -1 -3 =z² +2i z -4

So the equation is |z² +2i z -4| =2|z -i|

Hmm, still not helpful. Let me see:

If I let z =0, then |0 +0 -4|=4, and 2|0 -i|=2*1=2. So 4≠2, so z=0 is not a solution.

If z approaches 0, then |z² +2i z -4| ≈4, and 2|z -i|≈2*1=2, so LHS &gt;RHS near z=0. So the minimal |z| must be somewhere else.

Alternatively, consider parametrizing z in terms of |z|. Let me write z = r e^{iθ}, then |z|=r. Then we need to express the equation in terms of r and θ.

But this might be complicated. Let me attempt it.

Express z = r e^{iθ}. Then z +i = r e^{iθ} +i. Let me compute (z +i)^2:

(z +i)^2 = (r e^{iθ} +i)^2 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -1

Therefore, (z +i)^2 -3 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4

So modulus squared is |r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4|² = [r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2

And the right side is 2|z -i| =2| r e^{iθ} -i | =2 sqrt(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

So squaring both sides:

[r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2 =4(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

This equation relates r and θ. To find the minimal r, we can try to analyze this equation.

This looks very involved, but perhaps consider specific angles θ where the equation simplifies.

For instance, let me consider θ = -π/2, which would align z along the negative imaginary axis. Then z = -r i.

Compute left side:

[r² cos(-π) -4]^2 + [r² sin(-π) +2r cos(-π/2)]^2

= [r²*(-1) -4]^2 + [0 +2r*0]^2

= (-r² -4)^2 +0 = (r² +4)^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r*(-1))=4(r² +1 +2r)=4r² +4 +8r

Set equal:

(r² +4)^2 =4r² +8r +4

Expand left: r^4 +8r² +16

So equation: r^4 +8r² +16 =4r² +8r +4

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +4r² -8r +12=0

Not sure if this factors. Testing r=1:1 +4 -8 +12=9≠0

r=2:16 +16 -16 +12=28≠0

No obvious roots. So θ=-π/2 might not yield solutions.

Alternatively, take θ=0, so z is real positive. Then z =r.

Left side:

[r² cos0 -4]^2 +[r² sin0 +2r cos0]^2

= (r² -4)^2 + (0 +2r)^2 = (r² -4)^2 +4r²

Right side:

4(r² +1 -0)=4r² +4

Set equal:

(r² -4)^2 +4r² =4r² +4

Simplify: (r² -4)^2 =4

Take sqrt: r² -4=±2

Case1: r² -4=2 =&gt;r²=6 =&gt;r=√6≈2.449

Case2: r² -4=-2 =&gt;r²=2 =&gt;r=√2≈1.414

So θ=0, solutions at r=√2 and r=√6. So |z|=√2≈1.414 and √6≈2.449. But earlier, on the imaginary axis, we had |z|=2 -√2≈0.586, which is smaller. So these are not minimal.

Alternatively, check θ=π/2, z=ri, but already considered that case.

Alternatively, suppose θ=π/4. Then z = r e^{iπ/4}= r(√2/2 +i√2/2)

Compute left side:

[r² cos(π/2) -4]^2 + [r² sin(π/2) +2r cos(π/4)]^2

= [0 -4]^2 + [r²*1 +2r*(√2/2)]^2

=16 + [r² +√2 r]^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r sin(π/4))=4(r² +1 -2r*(√2/2))=4(r² +1 -√2 r)

Set equal:

16 + (r² +√2 r)^2 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Expand left:

16 +r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r²

Equation:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r² +16 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 -2r² +4√2 r +12=0

This seems difficult to solve. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis, as previously found. To confirm, maybe check another angle.

Alternatively, notice that when we substituted z =ti (i.e., x=0), we found solutions with |z|=2 -√2 and 2 +√2. The smaller one is 2 -√2≈0.5858.

But we need to check if there are any other solutions off the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

Suppose there exists a point z with |z| &lt;2 -√2. Let me assume such a point exists and see if it leads to a contradiction.

Let |z|=r &lt;2 -√2≈0.5858.

But since |z -i| &gt;= | |z| - |i| | = |r -1|. So 2|z -i| &gt;=2(1 -r)

On the other hand, |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= |(z +i)^2| +| -3| = |z +i|² +3. Since |z +i| &lt;=|z| +|i|=r +1. So |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

But we have equality |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So if 2(1 -r) &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

Let me check if this holds for r &lt;2 -√2.

Compute RHS - LHS = (r +1)^2 +3 -2(1 -r)=r² +2r +1 +3 -2 +2r=r² +4r +2

Which is positive for all real r. So this inequality holds for any r, but that doesn&#x27;t give us a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps using other inequalities. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= | |(z +i)^2| - |3| |. Which is | |z +i|² -3 |.

So we have | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;= |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;=2|z -i|

But not sure how helpful this is.

Alternatively, let me assume that the minimal |z| occurs at the point we found on the imaginary axis, 2 -√2≈0.586, and check if there can be any other points with smaller |z|.

Alternatively, note that the equation |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i| can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3|² =4|z -i|², which is the equation we derived earlier. If we assume that the minimal |z| occurs at a point where the gradient is colinear with the position vector, i.e., the point where the curve is tangent to the circle centered at the origin. But calculating this would require using Lagrange multipliers, which is quite involved given the complexity of the equation.

Alternatively, given the earlier solutions on the imaginary axis and given that when minimizing |z|, the closest point might lie on the imaginary axis due to symmetry. Since the equation involves z +i and z -i, which are vertical translations, it&#x27;s possible that the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal value we found is 2 -√2≈0.5858, and since we couldn&#x27;t find any solution with smaller |z|, and given the symmetry, this might be the minimal value.

Therefore, I think the minimal |z| is 2 -√2, achieved when z is on the imaginary axis at z=(-2 +√2)i, so |z|=| -2 +√2 | =2 -√2.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the minimum value of \(|z|\) for complex numbers \(z\) satisfying the equation \(|(z + i)^2 - 3| = 2|z - i|\), we start by substituting \(z = w + i\) where \(w = z - i\). This transforms the equation into \(|(w + 2i)^2 - 3| = 2|w|\).

We then consider \(w = x + yi\) and substitute into the equation. After expanding and simplifying both sides, we find that the equation becomes complex. However, by considering specific cases where \(w\) is purely imaginary (i.e., \(x = 0\)), we simplify the problem.

Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation, we solve for \(y\) and find the roots \(y = -3 \pm \sqrt{2}\). Translating back to \(z\), we get \(z = (-2 + \sqrt{2})i\) and \(z = (-2 - \sqrt{2})i\). The modulus \(|z|\) for these points is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} |\) and \(| -2 - \sqrt{2} |\), respectively.

The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} | = 2 - \sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).          </p>

Response: Start by finding \(|z+i)^2-3|\). Gotr \[z+i)^3=i^2+i+2(z-i)\] which we write as \[z=\frac{1-i}{2}+i\frac{-1-i}{2}\] Either one is fine, so let&#x27;s consider the second.

Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The question is asking for the minimum value of |z| where z is a complex number that satisfies the equation |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Hmm, complex numbers and modulus... I remember that complex numbers can be represented in the complex plane, so maybe I can translate this equation into geometric terms?

First, let me recall that for a complex number z = x + yi, |z| is the modulus, which is √(x² + y²). So |z| represents the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) in the plane. The problem wants the minimum such distance among all z that satisfy the given equation.

The equation given is |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Let me try to break this down. Let&#x27;s substitute z = x + yi into the equation. Then z + i = x + (y + 1)i. Squaring that gives (x + (y + 1)i)². Let me compute that:

(x + (y + 1)i)² = x² + 2x(y + 1)i + [(y + 1)i]²
= x² + 2x(y + 1)i - (y + 1)²
= (x² - (y + 1)²) + 2x(y + 1)i

So (z + i)² - 3 would be [(x² - (y + 1)²) - 3] + 2x(y + 1)i. Then the modulus of this is equal to 2|z - i|. Let&#x27;s compute both sides.

Left side modulus: sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side: 2|z - i| = 2| x + (y - 1)i | = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

So, the equation becomes:

sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²] = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

Hmm, that looks complicated. Maybe squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots would help. Let me try that.

Left side squared: [(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side squared: 4(x² + (y - 1)²)

So expanding the left side:

First, let me denote A = x² - (y + 1)² - 3, and B = 2x(y + 1). Then the left side squared is A² + B².

Compute A²:

[x² - (y + 1)² - 3]^2

Let me expand (y + 1)² first: y² + 2y + 1. So x² - (y² + 2y + 1) - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 1 - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 4.

Therefore, A = x² - y² - 2y - 4, so A² = (x² - y² - 2y - 4)²

Similarly, B = 2x(y + 1), so B² = 4x²(y + 1)²

So left side squared becomes:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4(x² + (y - 1)^2)

Let me expand the right side:

4(x² + y² - 2y + 1) = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

So now, the equation is:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

Hmm, this seems really messy. Maybe there&#x27;s a better way to approach this problem instead of expanding everything. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let w = z - i. Then z = w + i. Let me substitute that into the original equation.

So, |(w + i + i)² - 3| = 2|w + i - i| =&gt; |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

Maybe this substitution simplifies things. Let&#x27;s denote w = a + bi. Then w + 2i = a + (b + 2)i. Then (w + 2i)² is [a + (b + 2)i]² = a² + 2a(b + 2)i + [(b + 2)i]^2 = a² + 2a(b + 2)i - (b + 2)^2

So (w + 2i)^2 - 3 = [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3] + 2a(b + 2)i

Then the modulus squared is [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4|w|^2 = 4(a² + b²)

So expanding the left side:

[a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4(a² + b²)

Let me compute [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2. First, expand (b + 2)^2: b² + 4b + 4. So a² - b² -4b -4 -3 = a² - b² -4b -7. So the first term is (a² - b² -4b -7)^2.

Second term: [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4a²(b + 2)^2

So left side becomes:

(a² - b² -4b -7)^2 + 4a²(b + 2)^2 = 4a² + 4b²

This still seems complicated, but maybe expanding the left side will lead to some cancellation.

First, let&#x27;s expand (a² - b² -4b -7)^2:

= (a²)^2 + (-b² -4b -7)^2 + 2a²(-b² -4b -7)

= a^4 + (b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b² + 56b) + (-2a²b² -8a²b -14a²)

Wait, that&#x27;s a bit messy. Let me do it step by step.

Let me denote C = a² and D = -b² -4b -7. Then (C + D)^2 = C² + 2CD + D².

C² = (a²)^2 = a^4

2CD = 2a²(-b² -4b -7) = -2a²b² -8a²b -14a²

D² = (-b² -4b -7)^2. Let&#x27;s compute that:

= (b² +4b +7)^2

= (b²)^2 + (4b)^2 + (7)^2 + 2*b²*4b + 2*b²*7 + 2*4b*7

= b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b^2 + 56b

= b^4 + 8b^3 + (16b^2 +14b^2) +56b +49

= b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So D² = b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So putting it all together, (a² - b² -4b -7)^2 = a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, adding the second term: 4a²(b + 2)^2

First compute (b + 2)^2 = b² +4b +4. Then 4a²*(b² +4b +4) = 4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

So the entire left side becomes:

a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 +4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

a^4: a^4

a²b² terms: -2a²b² +4a²b² = 2a²b²

a²b terms: -8a²b +16a²b = 8a²b

a² terms: -14a² +16a² = 2a²

b^4: b^4

b^3:8b^3

b^2:30b^2

b terms:56b

constants:49

So left side simplifies to:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, the right side is 4a² +4b²

Therefore, the equation is:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 = 4a² +4b²

Bringing all terms to the left side:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 -4a² -4b² =0

Simplify:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b + (2a² -4a²) + b^4 +8b^3 + (30b^2 -4b^2) +56b +49 =0

Which simplifies to:

a^4 +2a²b² +8a²b -2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +26b^2 +56b +49=0

Hmm, this still looks quite complicated. Maybe there&#x27;s a different approach here. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z - i|

Perhaps instead of substituting z = x + yi, I can interpret this geometrically. Let me recall that for complex numbers, |A - B| represents the distance between points A and B in the complex plane.

But here, the equation is |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Hmm, that&#x27;s not a straightforward distance. Alternatively, maybe I can see (z + i)^2 as some transformation of z. Squaring a complex number can be seen as a geometric transformation: squaring the modulus and doubling the angle. But I&#x27;m not sure how that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe set w = z + i, so z = w - i. Then the equation becomes |w² - 3| = 2|w - 2i|

But maybe this substitution can help. Let me check:

Original substitution: z = w - i, so z + i = w, and z - i = w - 2i. Then the equation |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

So we have |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Maybe this is easier to handle. Let me denote w = a + bi. Then w² = (a + bi)^2 = a² - b² + 2abi. Then w² - 3 = (a² - b² -3) + 2abi. The modulus of this is sqrt[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] and the right side is 2*sqrt[a² + (b - 2)^2]. Then squaring both sides:

[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] = 4[a² + (b -2)^2]

But this seems similar to the previous approach. Maybe expanding this will lead to the same equation.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a parametrization or polar coordinates. Let me try that. Let me set w = r e^{iθ}, where r = |w|, θ is the argument.

Then |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Expressing in polar coordinates:

|r² e^{i2θ} -3| = 2 | r e^{iθ} - 2i|

But this might not lead to an easy equation either. Let me compute both sides.

Left side modulus: |r² e^{i2θ} -3|. This is the distance from the point (r² cos 2θ, r² sin 2θ) to (3, 0).

Right side: 2|r e^{iθ} - 2i| = 2| (r cos θ) + i(r sin θ - 2)| = 2 sqrt[ (r cos θ)^2 + (r sin θ -2)^2 ]

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps consider specific points. For example, if z is real, then z = x, so y =0. Then compute if that satisfies the equation.

But maybe that&#x27;s too restrictive. The minimum |z| might not occur on the real axis. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus. Let me consider that |z| is the distance from the origin, and we need to minimize this distance subject to the constraint |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. So this is an optimization problem with a constraint. Maybe Lagrange multipliers?

Yes, that&#x27;s a possible approach. Let me try that.

Let me denote z = x + yi. Then |z| = sqrt(x² + y²). We need to minimize x² + y² (since sqrt is increasing, minimizing sqrt(x² + y²) is equivalent to minimizing x² + y²).

The constraint is |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0. Let me denote f(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

So using Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of the objective function and the constraint should be proportional.

The objective function is F(x, y) = x² + y².

The constraint is G(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

Compute ∇F = [2x, 2y]

Compute ∇G. This is a bit involved, but let&#x27;s recall that for a function G(x,y) = |A(x, y)| - |B(x, y)|, the gradient is (∇|A| - ∇|B|). So need to compute gradients of |(z +i)^2 -3| and 2|z -i|.

Let me first compute |(z +i)^2 -3|.

Let me denote A = (z +i)^2 -3. Then |A| is modulus of A.

Express A in terms of x and y. As earlier, z = x + yi, so z +i = x + (y +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = x² - (y +1)^2 + 2x(y +1)i. Then subtract 3: [x² - (y +1)^2 -3] + 2x(y +1)i. So A = u + vi where u = x² - (y +1)^2 -3 and v = 2x(y +1).

Thus, |A| = sqrt(u² + v²). The gradient of |A| is ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) )

Similarly, |B| where B = z -i = x + (y -1)i, so |B| = sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2). The gradient of |B| is (x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2), (y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2))

Therefore, gradient of G = ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*(x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*((y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)) )

This seems very complicated, but maybe at the minimal point, there is some symmetry or simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps parameterizing the problem. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|

Let me let z -i = w. Then z = w + i. Then z + i = w + 2i. So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)^2 -3| = 2|w|

So |w² +4i w -4 -3| =2|w|, since (w + 2i)^2 = w² +4i w + (2i)^2 = w² +4i w -4. Then subtract 3: w² +4i w -7.

Thus, |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|

Hmm, maybe if I write this as |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|, perhaps dividing both sides by |w| (assuming w ≠0):

| w +4i -7/w | =2

But not sure if this helps. Let me check:

If w ≠0, then divide both sides by |w|:

| (w² +4i w -7)/w | =2 =&gt; |w +4i -7/w| =2

But this might not necessarily help. Alternatively, set t = w, then |t² +4i t -7| =2|t|. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |t² +4i t -7|² =4|t|²

So (t² +4i t -7)(\overline{t² +4i t -7}) =4|t|²

But this is getting too algebraic. Let me try to write t as x + yi.

Let t = x + yi. Then t² = (x + yi)^2 = x² - y² + 2xyi

4i t =4i(x + yi) = -4y +4x i

So t² +4i t -7 = (x² - y² -4y -7) + (2xy +4x)i

Thus, modulus squared is (x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4(x² + y²)

So equation:

(x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4x² +4y²

Wait, this is the same equation I had earlier when substituting w = t = z -i. So seems like we end up at the same quartic equation. Maybe expanding is the way to go.

Let me try expanding the left side:

First term: (x² - y² -4y -7)^2

Let me expand this:

= (x²)^2 + (-y² -4y -7)^2 + 2x²*(-y² -4y -7)

= x^4 + (y^4 +16y² +49 +8y^3 +14y² +56y) + (-2x²y² -8x²y -14x²)

Wait, similar to before:

Wait, (-y² -4y -7)^2 = (y² +4y +7)^2 = y^4 +8y^3 + (16y² +14y²) +56y +49 = y^4 +8y^3 +30y^2 +56y +49

And the cross term is 2x²*(-y² -4y -7) = -2x²y² -8x²y -14x²

Second term: (2xy +4x)^2 =4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

So left side total:

x^4 + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -2x²y² -8x²y -14x² +4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

Combine like terms:

x^4 + [y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49] + [(-2x²y² +4x²y²) + (-8x²y +16x²y) + (-14x² +16x²)]

Simplify each group:

x^4 remains.

y terms: y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

x²y² terms: (-2 +4)x²y² =2x²y²

x²y terms: (-8 +16)x²y =8x²y

x² terms: (-14 +16)x² =2x²

So left side becomes:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

Set equal to right side 4x² +4y²:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 =4x² +4y²

Bring all terms to left side:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -4x² -4y²=0

Simplify:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y + (2x² -4x²) + y^4 +8y^3 + (30y² -4y²) +56y +49=0

Which simplifies to:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y -2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

This equation is still very complicated. Maybe factorizing or looking for possible substitutions.

Alternatively, maybe trying specific values. For example, suppose x =0. Then the equation becomes:

0 +0 +0 -0 + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

Which is y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0. Let me check if this has real roots. Hmm, possible rational roots are ±1,±7,±49. Testing y = -1:

1 -8 +26 -56 +49 =12 ≠0

y=-7: (-7)^4 +8*(-7)^3 +26*(-7)^2 +56*(-7) +49=2401 -2744 +1274 -392 +49= 2401 -2744= -343; -343 +1274=931; 931 -392=539; 539 +49=588≠0

Not zero. Maybe it factors into quadratics?

Suppose y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49 = (y² + a y + b)(y² +c y +d)

Multiply out:

y^4 + (a +c)y³ + (ac +b +d)y² + (ad + bc)y + bd

Set coefficients:

a +c=8

ac +b +d=26

ad + bc=56

bd=49

Since bd=49, possible pairs (b,d)=(7,7), (49,1), (-7,-7), etc. Let&#x27;s try positive integers first. 7 and7. Then b=7, d=7.

Then a +c=8

ac +7 +7=26 =&gt; ac=12

ad + bc=56 =&gt;7a +7c=56 =&gt;a +c=8. Which matches the first equation. So from a +c=8 and ac=12. Solving:

a and c are roots of t² -8t +12=0. Which factors as (t -6)(t -2)=0. So a=6, c=2 or a=2, c=6.

Check ad + bc: if a=6, c=2, then 7*6 +7*2=42 +14=56. Yes, works. Similarly if a=2, c=6: 7*2 +7*6=14 +42=56. So works.

Therefore, the quartic factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0

So setting x=0, the equation factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0. The roots would be y = [-6 ±sqrt(36 -28)]/2 = [-6 ±sqrt(8)]/2 = [-6 ±2√2]/2 = -3 ±√2. Similarly for the other quadratic: y = [-2 ±sqrt(4 -28)]/2. But sqrt(-24) is imaginary. So real roots are y = -3 +√2 and y = -3 -√2. But since x=0, then z =0 + yi -i = y -i. Wait, no. Wait, we set t = z -i =w, then x and y are coordinates of w. So z = w +i. If w has x=0, then z =0 + (y +1)i. So |z| = sqrt(0 + (y +1)^2) = |y +1|. The real roots for y are -3 ±√2. So |z| would be | (-3 ±√2 ) +1 | = | -2 ±√2 |. So |-2 +√2| and |-2 -√2|. Since √2≈1.414, so -2 +1.414≈-0.586, absolute value≈0.586. The other is |-2 -1.414|=3.414. So minimum |z| is approximately 0.586 when x=0. But is this the minimal overall? Because maybe when x≠0, we can get a smaller |z|.

But first, let&#x27;s check if these points are indeed solutions. If x=0 and y = -3 +√2, then w =0 + (-3 +√2)i, so z = w +i = (-3 +√2)i +i = (-2 +√2)i. Then |z| = | -2 +√2 | ≈0.586. Similarly, the other root gives |z|=3.414. So perhaps 2 -√2 is approximately0.586, which is 2 -1.414≈0.586.

But the question is whether there are other solutions with x≠0 that have smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal |z| occurs on the y-axis (x=0). Let me check that.

If x=0, then z = (0) + (y +1)i. So |z| is |y +1|. The minimal |y +1| occurs at y = -1, which gives |z|=0. But does y=-1 satisfy the equation? Let&#x27;s check.

If x=0 and y=-1, then w = z -i = (0 + (-1)i) -i = -2i. Then check |(w +2i)^2 -3| = |(-2i +2i)^2 -3| = |0 -3| =3. And 2|w| =2*| -2i | =4. 3≠4, so y=-1 is not a solution.

Wait, but when x=0, we had solutions at y= -3 ±√2. The minimal |z| for x=0 is | -2 +√2 |≈0.586. Let&#x27;s see if we can find a solution with x≠0 that has a smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal occurs at another point. Let me consider that |z| is minimal when z is closest to the origin on the curve defined by |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Maybe this curve is a circle or some conic section.

Alternatively, notice that the original equation can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Let me consider squaring both sides:

|(z +i)^2 -3|² = 4|z -i|²

Which can be written as [(z +i)^2 -3][\overline{(z +i)^2 -3}] =4(z -i)(\overline{z -i})

But this might not help unless expanded. Let me try writing z = x + yi and expanding everything again.

Alternatively, maybe notice that (z +i)^2 -3 is a quadratic in z, so the equation represents some quadratic curve. The set of points z where |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i| is likely a circle or an ellipse or hyperbola.

Alternatively, think of this as |(z +i)^2 -3| / |z -i| =2. So the ratio of distances is 2, which resembles the definition of an Apollonius circle. However, typically, Apollonius circle is |z -a| / |z -b| =k, which is a circle. But here, the numerator is |(z +i)^2 -3|, which is not a linear function, so the locus is not a circle. So maybe it&#x27;s a quartic curve.

Given that, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs at one of the points we found on the y-axis. But to confirm, perhaps consider other points.

Alternatively, parameterize the problem with z = ti where t is real. Let me try z = ti, then |z| = |t|. Let&#x27;s check if this satisfies the equation.

z = ti, so z +i = ti +i = (t +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = -(t +1)^2. Then (z +i)^2 -3 = - (t +1)^2 -3. The modulus is | - (t +1)^2 -3 | = (t +1)^2 +3.

On the other side, 2|z -i| =2| ti -i | =2| (t -1)i | =2|t -1|

So the equation becomes (t +1)^2 +3 =2|t -1|

Let me solve this equation.

Case 1: t &gt;=1. Then |t -1|=t -1.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3 =2(t -1)

Expand left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2t -2

So t² +2t +4 =2t -2

t² +6=0. No real solutions.

Case 2: t &lt;1. Then |t -1|=1 -t.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3=2(1 -t)

Left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2 -2t

So t² +2t +4 =2 -2t

t² +4t +2 =0

Solutions: t = [-4 ±sqrt(16 -8)]/2 =[-4 ±sqrt(8)]/2 =[-4 ±2√2]/2= -2 ±√2

So t = -2 +√2≈-0.585 and t=-2 -√2≈-3.414

Check if these are less than1: yes, both are.

So z =ti, so |z| =|t|. So the |z| for these solutions are |-2 +√2|≈0.586 and |-2 -√2|≈3.414. So same as before. So when z is purely imaginary, the minimal |z| is 2 -√2≈0.5857.

But is this the minimal overall? Maybe there are other points not on the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

To check, let&#x27;s suppose that minimal |z| occurs at a point not on the y-axis, so x≠0. To verify, perhaps set y such that the derivative is zero, but given the complexity of the equation, this might be difficult.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal |z| is achieved when z is colinear with the origin and the center of some circle... Wait, but the problem is that the equation is not a circle.

Alternatively, use the triangle inequality. Let me see:

We have |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

Note that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= ||(z +i)^2| -|3|| by the reverse triangle inequality. But not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, expand (z +i)^2 -3:

(z +i)^2 -3 = z² +2i z -1 -3 =z² +2i z -4

So the equation is |z² +2i z -4| =2|z -i|

Hmm, still not helpful. Let me see:

If I let z =0, then |0 +0 -4|=4, and 2|0 -i|=2*1=2. So 4≠2, so z=0 is not a solution.

If z approaches 0, then |z² +2i z -4| ≈4, and 2|z -i|≈2*1=2, so LHS &gt;RHS near z=0. So the minimal |z| must be somewhere else.

Alternatively, consider parametrizing z in terms of |z|. Let me write z = r e^{iθ}, then |z|=r. Then we need to express the equation in terms of r and θ.

But this might be complicated. Let me attempt it.

Express z = r e^{iθ}. Then z +i = r e^{iθ} +i. Let me compute (z +i)^2:

(z +i)^2 = (r e^{iθ} +i)^2 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -1

Therefore, (z +i)^2 -3 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4

So modulus squared is |r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4|² = [r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2

And the right side is 2|z -i| =2| r e^{iθ} -i | =2 sqrt(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

So squaring both sides:

[r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2 =4(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

This equation relates r and θ. To find the minimal r, we can try to analyze this equation.

This looks very involved, but perhaps consider specific angles θ where the equation simplifies.

For instance, let me consider θ = -π/2, which would align z along the negative imaginary axis. Then z = -r i.

Compute left side:

[r² cos(-π) -4]^2 + [r² sin(-π) +2r cos(-π/2)]^2

= [r²*(-1) -4]^2 + [0 +2r*0]^2

= (-r² -4)^2 +0 = (r² +4)^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r*(-1))=4(r² +1 +2r)=4r² +4 +8r

Set equal:

(r² +4)^2 =4r² +8r +4

Expand left: r^4 +8r² +16

So equation: r^4 +8r² +16 =4r² +8r +4

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +4r² -8r +12=0

Not sure if this factors. Testing r=1:1 +4 -8 +12=9≠0

r=2:16 +16 -16 +12=28≠0

No obvious roots. So θ=-π/2 might not yield solutions.

Alternatively, take θ=0, so z is real positive. Then z =r.

Left side:

[r² cos0 -4]^2 +[r² sin0 +2r cos0]^2

= (r² -4)^2 + (0 +2r)^2 = (r² -4)^2 +4r²

Right side:

4(r² +1 -0)=4r² +4

Set equal:

(r² -4)^2 +4r² =4r² +4

Simplify: (r² -4)^2 =4

Take sqrt: r² -4=±2

Case1: r² -4=2 =&gt;r²=6 =&gt;r=√6≈2.449

Case2: r² -4=-2 =&gt;r²=2 =&gt;r=√2≈1.414

So θ=0, solutions at r=√2 and r=√6. So |z|=√2≈1.414 and √6≈2.449. But earlier, on the imaginary axis, we had |z|=2 -√2≈0.586, which is smaller. So these are not minimal.

Alternatively, check θ=π/2, z=ri, but already considered that case.

Alternatively, suppose θ=π/4. Then z = r e^{iπ/4}= r(√2/2 +i√2/2)

Compute left side:

[r² cos(π/2) -4]^2 + [r² sin(π/2) +2r cos(π/4)]^2

= [0 -4]^2 + [r²*1 +2r*(√2/2)]^2

=16 + [r² +√2 r]^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r sin(π/4))=4(r² +1 -2r*(√2/2))=4(r² +1 -√2 r)

Set equal:

16 + (r² +√2 r)^2 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Expand left:

16 +r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r²

Equation:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r² +16 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 -2r² +4√2 r +12=0

This seems difficult to solve. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis, as previously found. To confirm, maybe check another angle.

Alternatively, notice that when we substituted z =ti (i.e., x=0), we found solutions with |z|=2 -√2 and 2 +√2. The smaller one is 2 -√2≈0.5858.

But we need to check if there are any other solutions off the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

Suppose there exists a point z with |z| &lt;2 -√2. Let me assume such a point exists and see if it leads to a contradiction.

Let |z|=r &lt;2 -√2≈0.5858.

But since |z -i| &gt;= | |z| - |i| | = |r -1|. So 2|z -i| &gt;=2(1 -r)

On the other hand, |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= |(z +i)^2| +| -3| = |z +i|² +3. Since |z +i| &lt;=|z| +|i|=r +1. So |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

But we have equality |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So if 2(1 -r) &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

Let me check if this holds for r &lt;2 -√2.

Compute RHS - LHS = (r +1)^2 +3 -2(1 -r)=r² +2r +1 +3 -2 +2r=r² +4r +2

Which is positive for all real r. So this inequality holds for any r, but that doesn&#x27;t give us a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps using other inequalities. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= | |(z +i)^2| - |3| |. Which is | |z +i|² -3 |.

So we have | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;= |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;=2|z -i|

But not sure how helpful this is.

Alternatively, let me assume that the minimal |z| occurs at the point we found on the imaginary axis, 2 -√2≈0.586, and check if there can be any other points with smaller |z|.

Alternatively, note that the equation |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i| can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3|² =4|z -i|², which is the equation we derived earlier. If we assume that the minimal |z| occurs at a point where the gradient is colinear with the position vector, i.e., the point where the curve is tangent to the circle centered at the origin. But calculating this would require using Lagrange multipliers, which is quite involved given the complexity of the equation.

Alternatively, given the earlier solutions on the imaginary axis and given that when minimizing |z|, the closest point might lie on the imaginary axis due to symmetry. Since the equation involves z +i and z -i, which are vertical translations, it&#x27;s possible that the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal value we found is 2 -√2≈0.5858, and since we couldn&#x27;t find any solution with smaller |z|, and given the symmetry, this might be the minimal value.

Therefore, I think the minimal |z| is 2 -√2, achieved when z is on the imaginary axis at z=(-2 +√2)i, so |z|=| -2 +√2 | =2 -√2.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the minimum value of \(|z|\) for complex numbers \(z\) satisfying the equation \(|(z + i)^2 - 3| = 2|z - i|\), we start by substituting \(z = w + i\) where \(w = z - i\). This transforms the equation into \(|(w + 2i)^2 - 3| = 2|w|\).

We then consider \(w = x + yi\) and substitute into the equation. After expanding and simplifying both sides, we find that the equation becomes complex. However, by considering specific cases where \(w\) is purely imaginary (i.e., \(x = 0\)), we simplify the problem.

Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation, we solve for \(y\) and find the roots \(y = -3 \pm \sqrt{2}\). Translating back to \(z\), we get \(z = (-2 + \sqrt{2})i\) and \(z = (-2 - \sqrt{2})i\). The modulus \(|z|\) for these points is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} |\) and \(| -2 - \sqrt{2} |\), respectively.

The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} | = 2 - \sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).          </p>

Problem: Find the minimum value of \(|z|\) for complex numbers \(z\) satisfying the equation \(|(z+i)^2-3| = 2|z-i|\). Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Arrange the equation to look like \(|(z+i)^2|(z-i)| = 2|(z-i)|^2 \). Then switch \(|z+i|^2 \) with the absolute value of that expression because the absolute value of a product is the product of the original numbers&#x27; absolute values. We get \(|(z+i)(z-i)| = 2|(z-i)^2|\) and \(|(z^2-iz+zi-z^2)| = 2|(z-i)^2|\) and evaluate. You&#x27;re gonna end up with \(z^2+iz^2 \) and ignore the \(i&#x27;s \) in the real part. You still need to distinguish the real and imaginary components when you solve. Here me, \(z = u + iv \rightarrow z^2 = u^2 - v^2 + 2uvi \) so \(u = \sqrt{(u^2 + v^2)^2 - 4(uv)^2} \) and \(v = \frac{2}{3}(uv - \sqrt{(u^2 + v^2)^2 - 4(uv)^2})\). So now we correct the \(|\) before each \(z\) and now we find the real numbers \[ \begin{array}{ll} |z| =\sqrt{(z+z^*z+z^*(z^*z^*+zz^*)/2)/2} = {1\over2}\sqrt{(z+\left(z^*\right)^{z^*z+z^*z^*})}\\ ————– (1)\\ \text{2}(|z|^2 = \left(\sqrt{(z^2)^2 - (z)^2 + ((z^2+z))^2} + 0\right)\\ ————– (2)\\ \text{3}(|z| = |\sqrt{(z^2)^2 - (z)^2 + ((z^2+z))^2}|)\\ ————– (3)\\ \text{4}(|z-\sqrt{(z^2)^2 - (z)^2 + ((z^2+z))^2}| = 2(zz^*+zz^*+zz^*))\\ ————– (4)\\ \text{5}(\left(|z| = 2(|\sqrt{(z^2)^2 - (z)^2 + ((z^2+z))^2}|+zz^*+zz^*+zz^*))\\ ————– (5)\\ \text{6}(|z| = |\sqrt{(z^z)^2 - (z)^2 + ((z^z+z))^2}+zz^*+zz^*+zz^*))\\ ————– (6)\\ \text{7}(|z| = |\sqrt{(z+z^z)^2 - (z)^2 + ((z+z^z)^2 + zz^*)^2}+zz^*+zz^*+zz^*))\\ ————– (7)\\ \text{8}|z| = |z \sqrt{(z+z^z)^2 - (z)^2 + ((z+z^z)^2 + zz^*)^2}+zz^*+zz^*+zz^*))\\ ————– (8)\\ \text{9}(|z| = \left(\sqrt{(z+z^z)^2 - (z)^2 + ((z+z^z)^2 + zz^*)^2} + zz^*)+zz^*\\ ————– (9)\\ |z| = |{1\over2}\sqrt{(z+z^z)^2 - (z)^2 + ((z+z^z)^2 + zz^*)^2} + {1\over2}zz^*+zz^*))\\ ————– (10) \end{array} \]&lt;|end_of_text|&gt;          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The question is asking for the minimum value of |z| where z is a complex number that satisfies the equation |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Hmm, complex numbers and modulus... I remember that complex numbers can be represented in the complex plane, so maybe I can translate this equation into geometric terms?

First, let me recall that for a complex number z = x + yi, |z| is the modulus, which is √(x² + y²). So |z| represents the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) in the plane. The problem wants the minimum such distance among all z that satisfy the given equation.

The equation given is |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Let me try to break this down. Let&#x27;s substitute z = x + yi into the equation. Then z + i = x + (y + 1)i. Squaring that gives (x + (y + 1)i)². Let me compute that:

(x + (y + 1)i)² = x² + 2x(y + 1)i + [(y + 1)i]²
= x² + 2x(y + 1)i - (y + 1)²
= (x² - (y + 1)²) + 2x(y + 1)i

So (z + i)² - 3 would be [(x² - (y + 1)²) - 3] + 2x(y + 1)i. Then the modulus of this is equal to 2|z - i|. Let&#x27;s compute both sides.

Left side modulus: sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side: 2|z - i| = 2| x + (y - 1)i | = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

So, the equation becomes:

sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²] = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

Hmm, that looks complicated. Maybe squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots would help. Let me try that.

Left side squared: [(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side squared: 4(x² + (y - 1)²)

So expanding the left side:

First, let me denote A = x² - (y + 1)² - 3, and B = 2x(y + 1). Then the left side squared is A² + B².

Compute A²:

[x² - (y + 1)² - 3]^2

Let me expand (y + 1)² first: y² + 2y + 1. So x² - (y² + 2y + 1) - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 1 - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 4.

Therefore, A = x² - y² - 2y - 4, so A² = (x² - y² - 2y - 4)²

Similarly, B = 2x(y + 1), so B² = 4x²(y + 1)²

So left side squared becomes:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4(x² + (y - 1)^2)

Let me expand the right side:

4(x² + y² - 2y + 1) = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

So now, the equation is:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

Hmm, this seems really messy. Maybe there&#x27;s a better way to approach this problem instead of expanding everything. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let w = z - i. Then z = w + i. Let me substitute that into the original equation.

So, |(w + i + i)² - 3| = 2|w + i - i| =&gt; |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

Maybe this substitution simplifies things. Let&#x27;s denote w = a + bi. Then w + 2i = a + (b + 2)i. Then (w + 2i)² is [a + (b + 2)i]² = a² + 2a(b + 2)i + [(b + 2)i]^2 = a² + 2a(b + 2)i - (b + 2)^2

So (w + 2i)^2 - 3 = [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3] + 2a(b + 2)i

Then the modulus squared is [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4|w|^2 = 4(a² + b²)

So expanding the left side:

[a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4(a² + b²)

Let me compute [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2. First, expand (b + 2)^2: b² + 4b + 4. So a² - b² -4b -4 -3 = a² - b² -4b -7. So the first term is (a² - b² -4b -7)^2.

Second term: [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4a²(b + 2)^2

So left side becomes:

(a² - b² -4b -7)^2 + 4a²(b + 2)^2 = 4a² + 4b²

This still seems complicated, but maybe expanding the left side will lead to some cancellation.

First, let&#x27;s expand (a² - b² -4b -7)^2:

= (a²)^2 + (-b² -4b -7)^2 + 2a²(-b² -4b -7)

= a^4 + (b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b² + 56b) + (-2a²b² -8a²b -14a²)

Wait, that&#x27;s a bit messy. Let me do it step by step.

Let me denote C = a² and D = -b² -4b -7. Then (C + D)^2 = C² + 2CD + D².

C² = (a²)^2 = a^4

2CD = 2a²(-b² -4b -7) = -2a²b² -8a²b -14a²

D² = (-b² -4b -7)^2. Let&#x27;s compute that:

= (b² +4b +7)^2

= (b²)^2 + (4b)^2 + (7)^2 + 2*b²*4b + 2*b²*7 + 2*4b*7

= b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b^2 + 56b

= b^4 + 8b^3 + (16b^2 +14b^2) +56b +49

= b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So D² = b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So putting it all together, (a² - b² -4b -7)^2 = a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, adding the second term: 4a²(b + 2)^2

First compute (b + 2)^2 = b² +4b +4. Then 4a²*(b² +4b +4) = 4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

So the entire left side becomes:

a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 +4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

a^4: a^4

a²b² terms: -2a²b² +4a²b² = 2a²b²

a²b terms: -8a²b +16a²b = 8a²b

a² terms: -14a² +16a² = 2a²

b^4: b^4

b^3:8b^3

b^2:30b^2

b terms:56b

constants:49

So left side simplifies to:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, the right side is 4a² +4b²

Therefore, the equation is:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 = 4a² +4b²

Bringing all terms to the left side:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 -4a² -4b² =0

Simplify:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b + (2a² -4a²) + b^4 +8b^3 + (30b^2 -4b^2) +56b +49 =0

Which simplifies to:

a^4 +2a²b² +8a²b -2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +26b^2 +56b +49=0

Hmm, this still looks quite complicated. Maybe there&#x27;s a different approach here. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z - i|

Perhaps instead of substituting z = x + yi, I can interpret this geometrically. Let me recall that for complex numbers, |A - B| represents the distance between points A and B in the complex plane.

But here, the equation is |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Hmm, that&#x27;s not a straightforward distance. Alternatively, maybe I can see (z + i)^2 as some transformation of z. Squaring a complex number can be seen as a geometric transformation: squaring the modulus and doubling the angle. But I&#x27;m not sure how that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe set w = z + i, so z = w - i. Then the equation becomes |w² - 3| = 2|w - 2i|

But maybe this substitution can help. Let me check:

Original substitution: z = w - i, so z + i = w, and z - i = w - 2i. Then the equation |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

So we have |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Maybe this is easier to handle. Let me denote w = a + bi. Then w² = (a + bi)^2 = a² - b² + 2abi. Then w² - 3 = (a² - b² -3) + 2abi. The modulus of this is sqrt[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] and the right side is 2*sqrt[a² + (b - 2)^2]. Then squaring both sides:

[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] = 4[a² + (b -2)^2]

But this seems similar to the previous approach. Maybe expanding this will lead to the same equation.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a parametrization or polar coordinates. Let me try that. Let me set w = r e^{iθ}, where r = |w|, θ is the argument.

Then |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Expressing in polar coordinates:

|r² e^{i2θ} -3| = 2 | r e^{iθ} - 2i|

But this might not lead to an easy equation either. Let me compute both sides.

Left side modulus: |r² e^{i2θ} -3|. This is the distance from the point (r² cos 2θ, r² sin 2θ) to (3, 0).

Right side: 2|r e^{iθ} - 2i| = 2| (r cos θ) + i(r sin θ - 2)| = 2 sqrt[ (r cos θ)^2 + (r sin θ -2)^2 ]

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps consider specific points. For example, if z is real, then z = x, so y =0. Then compute if that satisfies the equation.

But maybe that&#x27;s too restrictive. The minimum |z| might not occur on the real axis. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus. Let me consider that |z| is the distance from the origin, and we need to minimize this distance subject to the constraint |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. So this is an optimization problem with a constraint. Maybe Lagrange multipliers?

Yes, that&#x27;s a possible approach. Let me try that.

Let me denote z = x + yi. Then |z| = sqrt(x² + y²). We need to minimize x² + y² (since sqrt is increasing, minimizing sqrt(x² + y²) is equivalent to minimizing x² + y²).

The constraint is |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0. Let me denote f(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

So using Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of the objective function and the constraint should be proportional.

The objective function is F(x, y) = x² + y².

The constraint is G(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

Compute ∇F = [2x, 2y]

Compute ∇G. This is a bit involved, but let&#x27;s recall that for a function G(x,y) = |A(x, y)| - |B(x, y)|, the gradient is (∇|A| - ∇|B|). So need to compute gradients of |(z +i)^2 -3| and 2|z -i|.

Let me first compute |(z +i)^2 -3|.

Let me denote A = (z +i)^2 -3. Then |A| is modulus of A.

Express A in terms of x and y. As earlier, z = x + yi, so z +i = x + (y +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = x² - (y +1)^2 + 2x(y +1)i. Then subtract 3: [x² - (y +1)^2 -3] + 2x(y +1)i. So A = u + vi where u = x² - (y +1)^2 -3 and v = 2x(y +1).

Thus, |A| = sqrt(u² + v²). The gradient of |A| is ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) )

Similarly, |B| where B = z -i = x + (y -1)i, so |B| = sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2). The gradient of |B| is (x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2), (y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2))

Therefore, gradient of G = ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*(x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*((y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)) )

This seems very complicated, but maybe at the minimal point, there is some symmetry or simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps parameterizing the problem. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|

Let me let z -i = w. Then z = w + i. Then z + i = w + 2i. So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)^2 -3| = 2|w|

So |w² +4i w -4 -3| =2|w|, since (w + 2i)^2 = w² +4i w + (2i)^2 = w² +4i w -4. Then subtract 3: w² +4i w -7.

Thus, |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|

Hmm, maybe if I write this as |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|, perhaps dividing both sides by |w| (assuming w ≠0):

| w +4i -7/w | =2

But not sure if this helps. Let me check:

If w ≠0, then divide both sides by |w|:

| (w² +4i w -7)/w | =2 =&gt; |w +4i -7/w| =2

But this might not necessarily help. Alternatively, set t = w, then |t² +4i t -7| =2|t|. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |t² +4i t -7|² =4|t|²

So (t² +4i t -7)(\overline{t² +4i t -7}) =4|t|²

But this is getting too algebraic. Let me try to write t as x + yi.

Let t = x + yi. Then t² = (x + yi)^2 = x² - y² + 2xyi

4i t =4i(x + yi) = -4y +4x i

So t² +4i t -7 = (x² - y² -4y -7) + (2xy +4x)i

Thus, modulus squared is (x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4(x² + y²)

So equation:

(x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4x² +4y²

Wait, this is the same equation I had earlier when substituting w = t = z -i. So seems like we end up at the same quartic equation. Maybe expanding is the way to go.

Let me try expanding the left side:

First term: (x² - y² -4y -7)^2

Let me expand this:

= (x²)^2 + (-y² -4y -7)^2 + 2x²*(-y² -4y -7)

= x^4 + (y^4 +16y² +49 +8y^3 +14y² +56y) + (-2x²y² -8x²y -14x²)

Wait, similar to before:

Wait, (-y² -4y -7)^2 = (y² +4y +7)^2 = y^4 +8y^3 + (16y² +14y²) +56y +49 = y^4 +8y^3 +30y^2 +56y +49

And the cross term is 2x²*(-y² -4y -7) = -2x²y² -8x²y -14x²

Second term: (2xy +4x)^2 =4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

So left side total:

x^4 + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -2x²y² -8x²y -14x² +4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

Combine like terms:

x^4 + [y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49] + [(-2x²y² +4x²y²) + (-8x²y +16x²y) + (-14x² +16x²)]

Simplify each group:

x^4 remains.

y terms: y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

x²y² terms: (-2 +4)x²y² =2x²y²

x²y terms: (-8 +16)x²y =8x²y

x² terms: (-14 +16)x² =2x²

So left side becomes:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

Set equal to right side 4x² +4y²:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 =4x² +4y²

Bring all terms to left side:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -4x² -4y²=0

Simplify:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y + (2x² -4x²) + y^4 +8y^3 + (30y² -4y²) +56y +49=0

Which simplifies to:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y -2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

This equation is still very complicated. Maybe factorizing or looking for possible substitutions.

Alternatively, maybe trying specific values. For example, suppose x =0. Then the equation becomes:

0 +0 +0 -0 + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

Which is y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0. Let me check if this has real roots. Hmm, possible rational roots are ±1,±7,±49. Testing y = -1:

1 -8 +26 -56 +49 =12 ≠0

y=-7: (-7)^4 +8*(-7)^3 +26*(-7)^2 +56*(-7) +49=2401 -2744 +1274 -392 +49= 2401 -2744= -343; -343 +1274=931; 931 -392=539; 539 +49=588≠0

Not zero. Maybe it factors into quadratics?

Suppose y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49 = (y² + a y + b)(y² +c y +d)

Multiply out:

y^4 + (a +c)y³ + (ac +b +d)y² + (ad + bc)y + bd

Set coefficients:

a +c=8

ac +b +d=26

ad + bc=56

bd=49

Since bd=49, possible pairs (b,d)=(7,7), (49,1), (-7,-7), etc. Let&#x27;s try positive integers first. 7 and7. Then b=7, d=7.

Then a +c=8

ac +7 +7=26 =&gt; ac=12

ad + bc=56 =&gt;7a +7c=56 =&gt;a +c=8. Which matches the first equation. So from a +c=8 and ac=12. Solving:

a and c are roots of t² -8t +12=0. Which factors as (t -6)(t -2)=0. So a=6, c=2 or a=2, c=6.

Check ad + bc: if a=6, c=2, then 7*6 +7*2=42 +14=56. Yes, works. Similarly if a=2, c=6: 7*2 +7*6=14 +42=56. So works.

Therefore, the quartic factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0

So setting x=0, the equation factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0. The roots would be y = [-6 ±sqrt(36 -28)]/2 = [-6 ±sqrt(8)]/2 = [-6 ±2√2]/2 = -3 ±√2. Similarly for the other quadratic: y = [-2 ±sqrt(4 -28)]/2. But sqrt(-24) is imaginary. So real roots are y = -3 +√2 and y = -3 -√2. But since x=0, then z =0 + yi -i = y -i. Wait, no. Wait, we set t = z -i =w, then x and y are coordinates of w. So z = w +i. If w has x=0, then z =0 + (y +1)i. So |z| = sqrt(0 + (y +1)^2) = |y +1|. The real roots for y are -3 ±√2. So |z| would be | (-3 ±√2 ) +1 | = | -2 ±√2 |. So |-2 +√2| and |-2 -√2|. Since √2≈1.414, so -2 +1.414≈-0.586, absolute value≈0.586. The other is |-2 -1.414|=3.414. So minimum |z| is approximately 0.586 when x=0. But is this the minimal overall? Because maybe when x≠0, we can get a smaller |z|.

But first, let&#x27;s check if these points are indeed solutions. If x=0 and y = -3 +√2, then w =0 + (-3 +√2)i, so z = w +i = (-3 +√2)i +i = (-2 +√2)i. Then |z| = | -2 +√2 | ≈0.586. Similarly, the other root gives |z|=3.414. So perhaps 2 -√2 is approximately0.586, which is 2 -1.414≈0.586.

But the question is whether there are other solutions with x≠0 that have smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal |z| occurs on the y-axis (x=0). Let me check that.

If x=0, then z = (0) + (y +1)i. So |z| is |y +1|. The minimal |y +1| occurs at y = -1, which gives |z|=0. But does y=-1 satisfy the equation? Let&#x27;s check.

If x=0 and y=-1, then w = z -i = (0 + (-1)i) -i = -2i. Then check |(w +2i)^2 -3| = |(-2i +2i)^2 -3| = |0 -3| =3. And 2|w| =2*| -2i | =4. 3≠4, so y=-1 is not a solution.

Wait, but when x=0, we had solutions at y= -3 ±√2. The minimal |z| for x=0 is | -2 +√2 |≈0.586. Let&#x27;s see if we can find a solution with x≠0 that has a smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal occurs at another point. Let me consider that |z| is minimal when z is closest to the origin on the curve defined by |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Maybe this curve is a circle or some conic section.

Alternatively, notice that the original equation can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Let me consider squaring both sides:

|(z +i)^2 -3|² = 4|z -i|²

Which can be written as [(z +i)^2 -3][\overline{(z +i)^2 -3}] =4(z -i)(\overline{z -i})

But this might not help unless expanded. Let me try writing z = x + yi and expanding everything again.

Alternatively, maybe notice that (z +i)^2 -3 is a quadratic in z, so the equation represents some quadratic curve. The set of points z where |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i| is likely a circle or an ellipse or hyperbola.

Alternatively, think of this as |(z +i)^2 -3| / |z -i| =2. So the ratio of distances is 2, which resembles the definition of an Apollonius circle. However, typically, Apollonius circle is |z -a| / |z -b| =k, which is a circle. But here, the numerator is |(z +i)^2 -3|, which is not a linear function, so the locus is not a circle. So maybe it&#x27;s a quartic curve.

Given that, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs at one of the points we found on the y-axis. But to confirm, perhaps consider other points.

Alternatively, parameterize the problem with z = ti where t is real. Let me try z = ti, then |z| = |t|. Let&#x27;s check if this satisfies the equation.

z = ti, so z +i = ti +i = (t +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = -(t +1)^2. Then (z +i)^2 -3 = - (t +1)^2 -3. The modulus is | - (t +1)^2 -3 | = (t +1)^2 +3.

On the other side, 2|z -i| =2| ti -i | =2| (t -1)i | =2|t -1|

So the equation becomes (t +1)^2 +3 =2|t -1|

Let me solve this equation.

Case 1: t &gt;=1. Then |t -1|=t -1.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3 =2(t -1)

Expand left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2t -2

So t² +2t +4 =2t -2

t² +6=0. No real solutions.

Case 2: t &lt;1. Then |t -1|=1 -t.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3=2(1 -t)

Left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2 -2t

So t² +2t +4 =2 -2t

t² +4t +2 =0

Solutions: t = [-4 ±sqrt(16 -8)]/2 =[-4 ±sqrt(8)]/2 =[-4 ±2√2]/2= -2 ±√2

So t = -2 +√2≈-0.585 and t=-2 -√2≈-3.414

Check if these are less than1: yes, both are.

So z =ti, so |z| =|t|. So the |z| for these solutions are |-2 +√2|≈0.586 and |-2 -√2|≈3.414. So same as before. So when z is purely imaginary, the minimal |z| is 2 -√2≈0.5857.

But is this the minimal overall? Maybe there are other points not on the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

To check, let&#x27;s suppose that minimal |z| occurs at a point not on the y-axis, so x≠0. To verify, perhaps set y such that the derivative is zero, but given the complexity of the equation, this might be difficult.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal |z| is achieved when z is colinear with the origin and the center of some circle... Wait, but the problem is that the equation is not a circle.

Alternatively, use the triangle inequality. Let me see:

We have |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

Note that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= ||(z +i)^2| -|3|| by the reverse triangle inequality. But not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, expand (z +i)^2 -3:

(z +i)^2 -3 = z² +2i z -1 -3 =z² +2i z -4

So the equation is |z² +2i z -4| =2|z -i|

Hmm, still not helpful. Let me see:

If I let z =0, then |0 +0 -4|=4, and 2|0 -i|=2*1=2. So 4≠2, so z=0 is not a solution.

If z approaches 0, then |z² +2i z -4| ≈4, and 2|z -i|≈2*1=2, so LHS &gt;RHS near z=0. So the minimal |z| must be somewhere else.

Alternatively, consider parametrizing z in terms of |z|. Let me write z = r e^{iθ}, then |z|=r. Then we need to express the equation in terms of r and θ.

But this might be complicated. Let me attempt it.

Express z = r e^{iθ}. Then z +i = r e^{iθ} +i. Let me compute (z +i)^2:

(z +i)^2 = (r e^{iθ} +i)^2 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -1

Therefore, (z +i)^2 -3 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4

So modulus squared is |r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4|² = [r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2

And the right side is 2|z -i| =2| r e^{iθ} -i | =2 sqrt(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

So squaring both sides:

[r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2 =4(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

This equation relates r and θ. To find the minimal r, we can try to analyze this equation.

This looks very involved, but perhaps consider specific angles θ where the equation simplifies.

For instance, let me consider θ = -π/2, which would align z along the negative imaginary axis. Then z = -r i.

Compute left side:

[r² cos(-π) -4]^2 + [r² sin(-π) +2r cos(-π/2)]^2

= [r²*(-1) -4]^2 + [0 +2r*0]^2

= (-r² -4)^2 +0 = (r² +4)^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r*(-1))=4(r² +1 +2r)=4r² +4 +8r

Set equal:

(r² +4)^2 =4r² +8r +4

Expand left: r^4 +8r² +16

So equation: r^4 +8r² +16 =4r² +8r +4

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +4r² -8r +12=0

Not sure if this factors. Testing r=1:1 +4 -8 +12=9≠0

r=2:16 +16 -16 +12=28≠0

No obvious roots. So θ=-π/2 might not yield solutions.

Alternatively, take θ=0, so z is real positive. Then z =r.

Left side:

[r² cos0 -4]^2 +[r² sin0 +2r cos0]^2

= (r² -4)^2 + (0 +2r)^2 = (r² -4)^2 +4r²

Right side:

4(r² +1 -0)=4r² +4

Set equal:

(r² -4)^2 +4r² =4r² +4

Simplify: (r² -4)^2 =4

Take sqrt: r² -4=±2

Case1: r² -4=2 =&gt;r²=6 =&gt;r=√6≈2.449

Case2: r² -4=-2 =&gt;r²=2 =&gt;r=√2≈1.414

So θ=0, solutions at r=√2 and r=√6. So |z|=√2≈1.414 and √6≈2.449. But earlier, on the imaginary axis, we had |z|=2 -√2≈0.586, which is smaller. So these are not minimal.

Alternatively, check θ=π/2, z=ri, but already considered that case.

Alternatively, suppose θ=π/4. Then z = r e^{iπ/4}= r(√2/2 +i√2/2)

Compute left side:

[r² cos(π/2) -4]^2 + [r² sin(π/2) +2r cos(π/4)]^2

= [0 -4]^2 + [r²*1 +2r*(√2/2)]^2

=16 + [r² +√2 r]^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r sin(π/4))=4(r² +1 -2r*(√2/2))=4(r² +1 -√2 r)

Set equal:

16 + (r² +√2 r)^2 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Expand left:

16 +r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r²

Equation:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r² +16 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 -2r² +4√2 r +12=0

This seems difficult to solve. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis, as previously found. To confirm, maybe check another angle.

Alternatively, notice that when we substituted z =ti (i.e., x=0), we found solutions with |z|=2 -√2 and 2 +√2. The smaller one is 2 -√2≈0.5858.

But we need to check if there are any other solutions off the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

Suppose there exists a point z with |z| &lt;2 -√2. Let me assume such a point exists and see if it leads to a contradiction.

Let |z|=r &lt;2 -√2≈0.5858.

But since |z -i| &gt;= | |z| - |i| | = |r -1|. So 2|z -i| &gt;=2(1 -r)

On the other hand, |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= |(z +i)^2| +| -3| = |z +i|² +3. Since |z +i| &lt;=|z| +|i|=r +1. So |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

But we have equality |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So if 2(1 -r) &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

Let me check if this holds for r &lt;2 -√2.

Compute RHS - LHS = (r +1)^2 +3 -2(1 -r)=r² +2r +1 +3 -2 +2r=r² +4r +2

Which is positive for all real r. So this inequality holds for any r, but that doesn&#x27;t give us a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps using other inequalities. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= | |(z +i)^2| - |3| |. Which is | |z +i|² -3 |.

So we have | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;= |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;=2|z -i|

But not sure how helpful this is.

Alternatively, let me assume that the minimal |z| occurs at the point we found on the imaginary axis, 2 -√2≈0.586, and check if there can be any other points with smaller |z|.

Alternatively, note that the equation |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i| can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3|² =4|z -i|², which is the equation we derived earlier. If we assume that the minimal |z| occurs at a point where the gradient is colinear with the position vector, i.e., the point where the curve is tangent to the circle centered at the origin. But calculating this would require using Lagrange multipliers, which is quite involved given the complexity of the equation.

Alternatively, given the earlier solutions on the imaginary axis and given that when minimizing |z|, the closest point might lie on the imaginary axis due to symmetry. Since the equation involves z +i and z -i, which are vertical translations, it&#x27;s possible that the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal value we found is 2 -√2≈0.5858, and since we couldn&#x27;t find any solution with smaller |z|, and given the symmetry, this might be the minimal value.

Therefore, I think the minimal |z| is 2 -√2, achieved when z is on the imaginary axis at z=(-2 +√2)i, so |z|=| -2 +√2 | =2 -√2.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the minimum value of \(|z|\) for complex numbers \(z\) satisfying the equation \(|(z + i)^2 - 3| = 2|z - i|\), we start by substituting \(z = w + i\) where \(w = z - i\). This transforms the equation into \(|(w + 2i)^2 - 3| = 2|w|\).

We then consider \(w = x + yi\) and substitute into the equation. After expanding and simplifying both sides, we find that the equation becomes complex. However, by considering specific cases where \(w\) is purely imaginary (i.e., \(x = 0\)), we simplify the problem.

Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation, we solve for \(y\) and find the roots \(y = -3 \pm \sqrt{2}\). Translating back to \(z\), we get \(z = (-2 + \sqrt{2})i\) and \(z = (-2 - \sqrt{2})i\). The modulus \(|z|\) for these points is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} |\) and \(| -2 - \sqrt{2} |\), respectively.

The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} | = 2 - \sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: We can expand it to
\(|(z+i)^2 - 3|\) let’s factor the right hand side:
\(|z+i|^2 - 2|z-i|\)
This gets us \(|z-i| (z+i) \). Then we expand \(|z+i|^2\): \(|z|^2 + |i|^2 + 2 \Re(z\dot i) + i j \). Now let’s group our factors: look at the real line, the imaginary line, and the modulus of our identity. \(|z|^2 - 2 |z-i| = (|z-i| - |z|)(|z-i| + |z|)\). Now let \(D = |z-i| + |z|\). Founding equation, \(2D = 2|z-i|\). We get \(|z| = |z-i| + |z-i|\).

Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The question is asking for the minimum value of |z| where z is a complex number that satisfies the equation |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Hmm, complex numbers and modulus... I remember that complex numbers can be represented in the complex plane, so maybe I can translate this equation into geometric terms?

First, let me recall that for a complex number z = x + yi, |z| is the modulus, which is √(x² + y²). So |z| represents the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) in the plane. The problem wants the minimum such distance among all z that satisfy the given equation.

The equation given is |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Let me try to break this down. Let&#x27;s substitute z = x + yi into the equation. Then z + i = x + (y + 1)i. Squaring that gives (x + (y + 1)i)². Let me compute that:

(x + (y + 1)i)² = x² + 2x(y + 1)i + [(y + 1)i]²
= x² + 2x(y + 1)i - (y + 1)²
= (x² - (y + 1)²) + 2x(y + 1)i

So (z + i)² - 3 would be [(x² - (y + 1)²) - 3] + 2x(y + 1)i. Then the modulus of this is equal to 2|z - i|. Let&#x27;s compute both sides.

Left side modulus: sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side: 2|z - i| = 2| x + (y - 1)i | = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

So, the equation becomes:

sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²] = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

Hmm, that looks complicated. Maybe squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots would help. Let me try that.

Left side squared: [(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side squared: 4(x² + (y - 1)²)

So expanding the left side:

First, let me denote A = x² - (y + 1)² - 3, and B = 2x(y + 1). Then the left side squared is A² + B².

Compute A²:

[x² - (y + 1)² - 3]^2

Let me expand (y + 1)² first: y² + 2y + 1. So x² - (y² + 2y + 1) - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 1 - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 4.

Therefore, A = x² - y² - 2y - 4, so A² = (x² - y² - 2y - 4)²

Similarly, B = 2x(y + 1), so B² = 4x²(y + 1)²

So left side squared becomes:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4(x² + (y - 1)^2)

Let me expand the right side:

4(x² + y² - 2y + 1) = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

So now, the equation is:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

Hmm, this seems really messy. Maybe there&#x27;s a better way to approach this problem instead of expanding everything. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let w = z - i. Then z = w + i. Let me substitute that into the original equation.

So, |(w + i + i)² - 3| = 2|w + i - i| =&gt; |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

Maybe this substitution simplifies things. Let&#x27;s denote w = a + bi. Then w + 2i = a + (b + 2)i. Then (w + 2i)² is [a + (b + 2)i]² = a² + 2a(b + 2)i + [(b + 2)i]^2 = a² + 2a(b + 2)i - (b + 2)^2

So (w + 2i)^2 - 3 = [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3] + 2a(b + 2)i

Then the modulus squared is [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4|w|^2 = 4(a² + b²)

So expanding the left side:

[a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4(a² + b²)

Let me compute [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2. First, expand (b + 2)^2: b² + 4b + 4. So a² - b² -4b -4 -3 = a² - b² -4b -7. So the first term is (a² - b² -4b -7)^2.

Second term: [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4a²(b + 2)^2

So left side becomes:

(a² - b² -4b -7)^2 + 4a²(b + 2)^2 = 4a² + 4b²

This still seems complicated, but maybe expanding the left side will lead to some cancellation.

First, let&#x27;s expand (a² - b² -4b -7)^2:

= (a²)^2 + (-b² -4b -7)^2 + 2a²(-b² -4b -7)

= a^4 + (b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b² + 56b) + (-2a²b² -8a²b -14a²)

Wait, that&#x27;s a bit messy. Let me do it step by step.

Let me denote C = a² and D = -b² -4b -7. Then (C + D)^2 = C² + 2CD + D².

C² = (a²)^2 = a^4

2CD = 2a²(-b² -4b -7) = -2a²b² -8a²b -14a²

D² = (-b² -4b -7)^2. Let&#x27;s compute that:

= (b² +4b +7)^2

= (b²)^2 + (4b)^2 + (7)^2 + 2*b²*4b + 2*b²*7 + 2*4b*7

= b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b^2 + 56b

= b^4 + 8b^3 + (16b^2 +14b^2) +56b +49

= b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So D² = b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So putting it all together, (a² - b² -4b -7)^2 = a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, adding the second term: 4a²(b + 2)^2

First compute (b + 2)^2 = b² +4b +4. Then 4a²*(b² +4b +4) = 4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

So the entire left side becomes:

a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 +4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

a^4: a^4

a²b² terms: -2a²b² +4a²b² = 2a²b²

a²b terms: -8a²b +16a²b = 8a²b

a² terms: -14a² +16a² = 2a²

b^4: b^4

b^3:8b^3

b^2:30b^2

b terms:56b

constants:49

So left side simplifies to:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, the right side is 4a² +4b²

Therefore, the equation is:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 = 4a² +4b²

Bringing all terms to the left side:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 -4a² -4b² =0

Simplify:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b + (2a² -4a²) + b^4 +8b^3 + (30b^2 -4b^2) +56b +49 =0

Which simplifies to:

a^4 +2a²b² +8a²b -2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +26b^2 +56b +49=0

Hmm, this still looks quite complicated. Maybe there&#x27;s a different approach here. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z - i|

Perhaps instead of substituting z = x + yi, I can interpret this geometrically. Let me recall that for complex numbers, |A - B| represents the distance between points A and B in the complex plane.

But here, the equation is |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Hmm, that&#x27;s not a straightforward distance. Alternatively, maybe I can see (z + i)^2 as some transformation of z. Squaring a complex number can be seen as a geometric transformation: squaring the modulus and doubling the angle. But I&#x27;m not sure how that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe set w = z + i, so z = w - i. Then the equation becomes |w² - 3| = 2|w - 2i|

But maybe this substitution can help. Let me check:

Original substitution: z = w - i, so z + i = w, and z - i = w - 2i. Then the equation |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

So we have |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Maybe this is easier to handle. Let me denote w = a + bi. Then w² = (a + bi)^2 = a² - b² + 2abi. Then w² - 3 = (a² - b² -3) + 2abi. The modulus of this is sqrt[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] and the right side is 2*sqrt[a² + (b - 2)^2]. Then squaring both sides:

[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] = 4[a² + (b -2)^2]

But this seems similar to the previous approach. Maybe expanding this will lead to the same equation.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a parametrization or polar coordinates. Let me try that. Let me set w = r e^{iθ}, where r = |w|, θ is the argument.

Then |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Expressing in polar coordinates:

|r² e^{i2θ} -3| = 2 | r e^{iθ} - 2i|

But this might not lead to an easy equation either. Let me compute both sides.

Left side modulus: |r² e^{i2θ} -3|. This is the distance from the point (r² cos 2θ, r² sin 2θ) to (3, 0).

Right side: 2|r e^{iθ} - 2i| = 2| (r cos θ) + i(r sin θ - 2)| = 2 sqrt[ (r cos θ)^2 + (r sin θ -2)^2 ]

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps consider specific points. For example, if z is real, then z = x, so y =0. Then compute if that satisfies the equation.

But maybe that&#x27;s too restrictive. The minimum |z| might not occur on the real axis. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus. Let me consider that |z| is the distance from the origin, and we need to minimize this distance subject to the constraint |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. So this is an optimization problem with a constraint. Maybe Lagrange multipliers?

Yes, that&#x27;s a possible approach. Let me try that.

Let me denote z = x + yi. Then |z| = sqrt(x² + y²). We need to minimize x² + y² (since sqrt is increasing, minimizing sqrt(x² + y²) is equivalent to minimizing x² + y²).

The constraint is |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0. Let me denote f(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

So using Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of the objective function and the constraint should be proportional.

The objective function is F(x, y) = x² + y².

The constraint is G(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

Compute ∇F = [2x, 2y]

Compute ∇G. This is a bit involved, but let&#x27;s recall that for a function G(x,y) = |A(x, y)| - |B(x, y)|, the gradient is (∇|A| - ∇|B|). So need to compute gradients of |(z +i)^2 -3| and 2|z -i|.

Let me first compute |(z +i)^2 -3|.

Let me denote A = (z +i)^2 -3. Then |A| is modulus of A.

Express A in terms of x and y. As earlier, z = x + yi, so z +i = x + (y +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = x² - (y +1)^2 + 2x(y +1)i. Then subtract 3: [x² - (y +1)^2 -3] + 2x(y +1)i. So A = u + vi where u = x² - (y +1)^2 -3 and v = 2x(y +1).

Thus, |A| = sqrt(u² + v²). The gradient of |A| is ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) )

Similarly, |B| where B = z -i = x + (y -1)i, so |B| = sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2). The gradient of |B| is (x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2), (y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2))

Therefore, gradient of G = ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*(x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*((y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)) )

This seems very complicated, but maybe at the minimal point, there is some symmetry or simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps parameterizing the problem. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|

Let me let z -i = w. Then z = w + i. Then z + i = w + 2i. So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)^2 -3| = 2|w|

So |w² +4i w -4 -3| =2|w|, since (w + 2i)^2 = w² +4i w + (2i)^2 = w² +4i w -4. Then subtract 3: w² +4i w -7.

Thus, |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|

Hmm, maybe if I write this as |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|, perhaps dividing both sides by |w| (assuming w ≠0):

| w +4i -7/w | =2

But not sure if this helps. Let me check:

If w ≠0, then divide both sides by |w|:

| (w² +4i w -7)/w | =2 =&gt; |w +4i -7/w| =2

But this might not necessarily help. Alternatively, set t = w, then |t² +4i t -7| =2|t|. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |t² +4i t -7|² =4|t|²

So (t² +4i t -7)(\overline{t² +4i t -7}) =4|t|²

But this is getting too algebraic. Let me try to write t as x + yi.

Let t = x + yi. Then t² = (x + yi)^2 = x² - y² + 2xyi

4i t =4i(x + yi) = -4y +4x i

So t² +4i t -7 = (x² - y² -4y -7) + (2xy +4x)i

Thus, modulus squared is (x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4(x² + y²)

So equation:

(x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4x² +4y²

Wait, this is the same equation I had earlier when substituting w = t = z -i. So seems like we end up at the same quartic equation. Maybe expanding is the way to go.

Let me try expanding the left side:

First term: (x² - y² -4y -7)^2

Let me expand this:

= (x²)^2 + (-y² -4y -7)^2 + 2x²*(-y² -4y -7)

= x^4 + (y^4 +16y² +49 +8y^3 +14y² +56y) + (-2x²y² -8x²y -14x²)

Wait, similar to before:

Wait, (-y² -4y -7)^2 = (y² +4y +7)^2 = y^4 +8y^3 + (16y² +14y²) +56y +49 = y^4 +8y^3 +30y^2 +56y +49

And the cross term is 2x²*(-y² -4y -7) = -2x²y² -8x²y -14x²

Second term: (2xy +4x)^2 =4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

So left side total:

x^4 + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -2x²y² -8x²y -14x² +4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

Combine like terms:

x^4 + [y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49] + [(-2x²y² +4x²y²) + (-8x²y +16x²y) + (-14x² +16x²)]

Simplify each group:

x^4 remains.

y terms: y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

x²y² terms: (-2 +4)x²y² =2x²y²

x²y terms: (-8 +16)x²y =8x²y

x² terms: (-14 +16)x² =2x²

So left side becomes:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

Set equal to right side 4x² +4y²:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 =4x² +4y²

Bring all terms to left side:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -4x² -4y²=0

Simplify:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y + (2x² -4x²) + y^4 +8y^3 + (30y² -4y²) +56y +49=0

Which simplifies to:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y -2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

This equation is still very complicated. Maybe factorizing or looking for possible substitutions.

Alternatively, maybe trying specific values. For example, suppose x =0. Then the equation becomes:

0 +0 +0 -0 + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

Which is y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0. Let me check if this has real roots. Hmm, possible rational roots are ±1,±7,±49. Testing y = -1:

1 -8 +26 -56 +49 =12 ≠0

y=-7: (-7)^4 +8*(-7)^3 +26*(-7)^2 +56*(-7) +49=2401 -2744 +1274 -392 +49= 2401 -2744= -343; -343 +1274=931; 931 -392=539; 539 +49=588≠0

Not zero. Maybe it factors into quadratics?

Suppose y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49 = (y² + a y + b)(y² +c y +d)

Multiply out:

y^4 + (a +c)y³ + (ac +b +d)y² + (ad + bc)y + bd

Set coefficients:

a +c=8

ac +b +d=26

ad + bc=56

bd=49

Since bd=49, possible pairs (b,d)=(7,7), (49,1), (-7,-7), etc. Let&#x27;s try positive integers first. 7 and7. Then b=7, d=7.

Then a +c=8

ac +7 +7=26 =&gt; ac=12

ad + bc=56 =&gt;7a +7c=56 =&gt;a +c=8. Which matches the first equation. So from a +c=8 and ac=12. Solving:

a and c are roots of t² -8t +12=0. Which factors as (t -6)(t -2)=0. So a=6, c=2 or a=2, c=6.

Check ad + bc: if a=6, c=2, then 7*6 +7*2=42 +14=56. Yes, works. Similarly if a=2, c=6: 7*2 +7*6=14 +42=56. So works.

Therefore, the quartic factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0

So setting x=0, the equation factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0. The roots would be y = [-6 ±sqrt(36 -28)]/2 = [-6 ±sqrt(8)]/2 = [-6 ±2√2]/2 = -3 ±√2. Similarly for the other quadratic: y = [-2 ±sqrt(4 -28)]/2. But sqrt(-24) is imaginary. So real roots are y = -3 +√2 and y = -3 -√2. But since x=0, then z =0 + yi -i = y -i. Wait, no. Wait, we set t = z -i =w, then x and y are coordinates of w. So z = w +i. If w has x=0, then z =0 + (y +1)i. So |z| = sqrt(0 + (y +1)^2) = |y +1|. The real roots for y are -3 ±√2. So |z| would be | (-3 ±√2 ) +1 | = | -2 ±√2 |. So |-2 +√2| and |-2 -√2|. Since √2≈1.414, so -2 +1.414≈-0.586, absolute value≈0.586. The other is |-2 -1.414|=3.414. So minimum |z| is approximately 0.586 when x=0. But is this the minimal overall? Because maybe when x≠0, we can get a smaller |z|.

But first, let&#x27;s check if these points are indeed solutions. If x=0 and y = -3 +√2, then w =0 + (-3 +√2)i, so z = w +i = (-3 +√2)i +i = (-2 +√2)i. Then |z| = | -2 +√2 | ≈0.586. Similarly, the other root gives |z|=3.414. So perhaps 2 -√2 is approximately0.586, which is 2 -1.414≈0.586.

But the question is whether there are other solutions with x≠0 that have smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal |z| occurs on the y-axis (x=0). Let me check that.

If x=0, then z = (0) + (y +1)i. So |z| is |y +1|. The minimal |y +1| occurs at y = -1, which gives |z|=0. But does y=-1 satisfy the equation? Let&#x27;s check.

If x=0 and y=-1, then w = z -i = (0 + (-1)i) -i = -2i. Then check |(w +2i)^2 -3| = |(-2i +2i)^2 -3| = |0 -3| =3. And 2|w| =2*| -2i | =4. 3≠4, so y=-1 is not a solution.

Wait, but when x=0, we had solutions at y= -3 ±√2. The minimal |z| for x=0 is | -2 +√2 |≈0.586. Let&#x27;s see if we can find a solution with x≠0 that has a smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal occurs at another point. Let me consider that |z| is minimal when z is closest to the origin on the curve defined by |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Maybe this curve is a circle or some conic section.

Alternatively, notice that the original equation can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Let me consider squaring both sides:

|(z +i)^2 -3|² = 4|z -i|²

Which can be written as [(z +i)^2 -3][\overline{(z +i)^2 -3}] =4(z -i)(\overline{z -i})

But this might not help unless expanded. Let me try writing z = x + yi and expanding everything again.

Alternatively, maybe notice that (z +i)^2 -3 is a quadratic in z, so the equation represents some quadratic curve. The set of points z where |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i| is likely a circle or an ellipse or hyperbola.

Alternatively, think of this as |(z +i)^2 -3| / |z -i| =2. So the ratio of distances is 2, which resembles the definition of an Apollonius circle. However, typically, Apollonius circle is |z -a| / |z -b| =k, which is a circle. But here, the numerator is |(z +i)^2 -3|, which is not a linear function, so the locus is not a circle. So maybe it&#x27;s a quartic curve.

Given that, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs at one of the points we found on the y-axis. But to confirm, perhaps consider other points.

Alternatively, parameterize the problem with z = ti where t is real. Let me try z = ti, then |z| = |t|. Let&#x27;s check if this satisfies the equation.

z = ti, so z +i = ti +i = (t +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = -(t +1)^2. Then (z +i)^2 -3 = - (t +1)^2 -3. The modulus is | - (t +1)^2 -3 | = (t +1)^2 +3.

On the other side, 2|z -i| =2| ti -i | =2| (t -1)i | =2|t -1|

So the equation becomes (t +1)^2 +3 =2|t -1|

Let me solve this equation.

Case 1: t &gt;=1. Then |t -1|=t -1.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3 =2(t -1)

Expand left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2t -2

So t² +2t +4 =2t -2

t² +6=0. No real solutions.

Case 2: t &lt;1. Then |t -1|=1 -t.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3=2(1 -t)

Left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2 -2t

So t² +2t +4 =2 -2t

t² +4t +2 =0

Solutions: t = [-4 ±sqrt(16 -8)]/2 =[-4 ±sqrt(8)]/2 =[-4 ±2√2]/2= -2 ±√2

So t = -2 +√2≈-0.585 and t=-2 -√2≈-3.414

Check if these are less than1: yes, both are.

So z =ti, so |z| =|t|. So the |z| for these solutions are |-2 +√2|≈0.586 and |-2 -√2|≈3.414. So same as before. So when z is purely imaginary, the minimal |z| is 2 -√2≈0.5857.

But is this the minimal overall? Maybe there are other points not on the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

To check, let&#x27;s suppose that minimal |z| occurs at a point not on the y-axis, so x≠0. To verify, perhaps set y such that the derivative is zero, but given the complexity of the equation, this might be difficult.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal |z| is achieved when z is colinear with the origin and the center of some circle... Wait, but the problem is that the equation is not a circle.

Alternatively, use the triangle inequality. Let me see:

We have |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

Note that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= ||(z +i)^2| -|3|| by the reverse triangle inequality. But not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, expand (z +i)^2 -3:

(z +i)^2 -3 = z² +2i z -1 -3 =z² +2i z -4

So the equation is |z² +2i z -4| =2|z -i|

Hmm, still not helpful. Let me see:

If I let z =0, then |0 +0 -4|=4, and 2|0 -i|=2*1=2. So 4≠2, so z=0 is not a solution.

If z approaches 0, then |z² +2i z -4| ≈4, and 2|z -i|≈2*1=2, so LHS &gt;RHS near z=0. So the minimal |z| must be somewhere else.

Alternatively, consider parametrizing z in terms of |z|. Let me write z = r e^{iθ}, then |z|=r. Then we need to express the equation in terms of r and θ.

But this might be complicated. Let me attempt it.

Express z = r e^{iθ}. Then z +i = r e^{iθ} +i. Let me compute (z +i)^2:

(z +i)^2 = (r e^{iθ} +i)^2 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -1

Therefore, (z +i)^2 -3 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4

So modulus squared is |r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4|² = [r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2

And the right side is 2|z -i| =2| r e^{iθ} -i | =2 sqrt(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

So squaring both sides:

[r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2 =4(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

This equation relates r and θ. To find the minimal r, we can try to analyze this equation.

This looks very involved, but perhaps consider specific angles θ where the equation simplifies.

For instance, let me consider θ = -π/2, which would align z along the negative imaginary axis. Then z = -r i.

Compute left side:

[r² cos(-π) -4]^2 + [r² sin(-π) +2r cos(-π/2)]^2

= [r²*(-1) -4]^2 + [0 +2r*0]^2

= (-r² -4)^2 +0 = (r² +4)^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r*(-1))=4(r² +1 +2r)=4r² +4 +8r

Set equal:

(r² +4)^2 =4r² +8r +4

Expand left: r^4 +8r² +16

So equation: r^4 +8r² +16 =4r² +8r +4

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +4r² -8r +12=0

Not sure if this factors. Testing r=1:1 +4 -8 +12=9≠0

r=2:16 +16 -16 +12=28≠0

No obvious roots. So θ=-π/2 might not yield solutions.

Alternatively, take θ=0, so z is real positive. Then z =r.

Left side:

[r² cos0 -4]^2 +[r² sin0 +2r cos0]^2

= (r² -4)^2 + (0 +2r)^2 = (r² -4)^2 +4r²

Right side:

4(r² +1 -0)=4r² +4

Set equal:

(r² -4)^2 +4r² =4r² +4

Simplify: (r² -4)^2 =4

Take sqrt: r² -4=±2

Case1: r² -4=2 =&gt;r²=6 =&gt;r=√6≈2.449

Case2: r² -4=-2 =&gt;r²=2 =&gt;r=√2≈1.414

So θ=0, solutions at r=√2 and r=√6. So |z|=√2≈1.414 and √6≈2.449. But earlier, on the imaginary axis, we had |z|=2 -√2≈0.586, which is smaller. So these are not minimal.

Alternatively, check θ=π/2, z=ri, but already considered that case.

Alternatively, suppose θ=π/4. Then z = r e^{iπ/4}= r(√2/2 +i√2/2)

Compute left side:

[r² cos(π/2) -4]^2 + [r² sin(π/2) +2r cos(π/4)]^2

= [0 -4]^2 + [r²*1 +2r*(√2/2)]^2

=16 + [r² +√2 r]^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r sin(π/4))=4(r² +1 -2r*(√2/2))=4(r² +1 -√2 r)

Set equal:

16 + (r² +√2 r)^2 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Expand left:

16 +r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r²

Equation:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r² +16 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 -2r² +4√2 r +12=0

This seems difficult to solve. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis, as previously found. To confirm, maybe check another angle.

Alternatively, notice that when we substituted z =ti (i.e., x=0), we found solutions with |z|=2 -√2 and 2 +√2. The smaller one is 2 -√2≈0.5858.

But we need to check if there are any other solutions off the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

Suppose there exists a point z with |z| &lt;2 -√2. Let me assume such a point exists and see if it leads to a contradiction.

Let |z|=r &lt;2 -√2≈0.5858.

But since |z -i| &gt;= | |z| - |i| | = |r -1|. So 2|z -i| &gt;=2(1 -r)

On the other hand, |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= |(z +i)^2| +| -3| = |z +i|² +3. Since |z +i| &lt;=|z| +|i|=r +1. So |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

But we have equality |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So if 2(1 -r) &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

Let me check if this holds for r &lt;2 -√2.

Compute RHS - LHS = (r +1)^2 +3 -2(1 -r)=r² +2r +1 +3 -2 +2r=r² +4r +2

Which is positive for all real r. So this inequality holds for any r, but that doesn&#x27;t give us a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps using other inequalities. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= | |(z +i)^2| - |3| |. Which is | |z +i|² -3 |.

So we have | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;= |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;=2|z -i|

But not sure how helpful this is.

Alternatively, let me assume that the minimal |z| occurs at the point we found on the imaginary axis, 2 -√2≈0.586, and check if there can be any other points with smaller |z|.

Alternatively, note that the equation |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i| can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3|² =4|z -i|², which is the equation we derived earlier. If we assume that the minimal |z| occurs at a point where the gradient is colinear with the position vector, i.e., the point where the curve is tangent to the circle centered at the origin. But calculating this would require using Lagrange multipliers, which is quite involved given the complexity of the equation.

Alternatively, given the earlier solutions on the imaginary axis and given that when minimizing |z|, the closest point might lie on the imaginary axis due to symmetry. Since the equation involves z +i and z -i, which are vertical translations, it&#x27;s possible that the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal value we found is 2 -√2≈0.5858, and since we couldn&#x27;t find any solution with smaller |z|, and given the symmetry, this might be the minimal value.

Therefore, I think the minimal |z| is 2 -√2, achieved when z is on the imaginary axis at z=(-2 +√2)i, so |z|=| -2 +√2 | =2 -√2.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the minimum value of \(|z|\) for complex numbers \(z\) satisfying the equation \(|(z + i)^2 - 3| = 2|z - i|\), we start by substituting \(z = w + i\) where \(w = z - i\). This transforms the equation into \(|(w + 2i)^2 - 3| = 2|w|\).

We then consider \(w = x + yi\) and substitute into the equation. After expanding and simplifying both sides, we find that the equation becomes complex. However, by considering specific cases where \(w\) is purely imaginary (i.e., \(x = 0\)), we simplify the problem.

Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation, we solve for \(y\) and find the roots \(y = -3 \pm \sqrt{2}\). Translating back to \(z\), we get \(z = (-2 + \sqrt{2})i\) and \(z = (-2 - \sqrt{2})i\). The modulus \(|z|\) for these points is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} |\) and \(| -2 - \sqrt{2} |\), respectively.

The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} | = 2 - \sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The question is asking for the minimum value of |z| where z is a complex number that satisfies the equation |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Hmm, complex numbers and modulus... I remember that complex numbers can be represented in the complex plane, so maybe I can translate this equation into geometric terms?

First, let me recall that for a complex number z = x + yi, |z| is the modulus, which is √(x² + y²). So |z| represents the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) in the plane. The problem wants the minimum such distance among all z that satisfy the given equation.

The equation given is |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Let me try to break this down. Let&#x27;s substitute z = x + yi into the equation. Then z + i = x + (y + 1)i. Squaring that gives (x + (y + 1)i)². Let me compute that:

(x + (y + 1)i)² = x² + 2x(y + 1)i + [(y + 1)i]²
= x² + 2x(y + 1)i - (y + 1)²
= (x² - (y + 1)²) + 2x(y + 1)i

So (z + i)² - 3 would be [(x² - (y + 1)²) - 3] + 2x(y + 1)i. Then the modulus of this is equal to 2|z - i|. Let&#x27;s compute both sides.

Left side modulus: sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side: 2|z - i| = 2| x + (y - 1)i | = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

So, the equation becomes:

sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²] = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

Hmm, that looks complicated. Maybe squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots would help. Let me try that.

Left side squared: [(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side squared: 4(x² + (y - 1)²)

So expanding the left side:

First, let me denote A = x² - (y + 1)² - 3, and B = 2x(y + 1). Then the left side squared is A² + B².

Compute A²:

[x² - (y + 1)² - 3]^2

Let me expand (y + 1)² first: y² + 2y + 1. So x² - (y² + 2y + 1) - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 1 - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 4.

Therefore, A = x² - y² - 2y - 4, so A² = (x² - y² - 2y - 4)²

Similarly, B = 2x(y + 1), so B² = 4x²(y + 1)²

So left side squared becomes:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4(x² + (y - 1)^2)

Let me expand the right side:

4(x² + y² - 2y + 1) = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

So now, the equation is:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

Hmm, this seems really messy. Maybe there&#x27;s a better way to approach this problem instead of expanding everything. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let w = z - i. Then z = w + i. Let me substitute that into the original equation.

So, |(w + i + i)² - 3| = 2|w + i - i| =&gt; |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

Maybe this substitution simplifies things. Let&#x27;s denote w = a + bi. Then w + 2i = a + (b + 2)i. Then (w + 2i)² is [a + (b + 2)i]² = a² + 2a(b + 2)i + [(b + 2)i]^2 = a² + 2a(b + 2)i - (b + 2)^2

So (w + 2i)^2 - 3 = [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3] + 2a(b + 2)i

Then the modulus squared is [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4|w|^2 = 4(a² + b²)

So expanding the left side:

[a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4(a² + b²)

Let me compute [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2. First, expand (b + 2)^2: b² + 4b + 4. So a² - b² -4b -4 -3 = a² - b² -4b -7. So the first term is (a² - b² -4b -7)^2.

Second term: [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4a²(b + 2)^2

So left side becomes:

(a² - b² -4b -7)^2 + 4a²(b + 2)^2 = 4a² + 4b²

This still seems complicated, but maybe expanding the left side will lead to some cancellation.

First, let&#x27;s expand (a² - b² -4b -7)^2:

= (a²)^2 + (-b² -4b -7)^2 + 2a²(-b² -4b -7)

= a^4 + (b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b² + 56b) + (-2a²b² -8a²b -14a²)

Wait, that&#x27;s a bit messy. Let me do it step by step.

Let me denote C = a² and D = -b² -4b -7. Then (C + D)^2 = C² + 2CD + D².

C² = (a²)^2 = a^4

2CD = 2a²(-b² -4b -7) = -2a²b² -8a²b -14a²

D² = (-b² -4b -7)^2. Let&#x27;s compute that:

= (b² +4b +7)^2

= (b²)^2 + (4b)^2 + (7)^2 + 2*b²*4b + 2*b²*7 + 2*4b*7

= b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b^2 + 56b

= b^4 + 8b^3 + (16b^2 +14b^2) +56b +49

= b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So D² = b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So putting it all together, (a² - b² -4b -7)^2 = a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, adding the second term: 4a²(b + 2)^2

First compute (b + 2)^2 = b² +4b +4. Then 4a²*(b² +4b +4) = 4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

So the entire left side becomes:

a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 +4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

a^4: a^4

a²b² terms: -2a²b² +4a²b² = 2a²b²

a²b terms: -8a²b +16a²b = 8a²b

a² terms: -14a² +16a² = 2a²

b^4: b^4

b^3:8b^3

b^2:30b^2

b terms:56b

constants:49

So left side simplifies to:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, the right side is 4a² +4b²

Therefore, the equation is:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 = 4a² +4b²

Bringing all terms to the left side:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 -4a² -4b² =0

Simplify:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b + (2a² -4a²) + b^4 +8b^3 + (30b^2 -4b^2) +56b +49 =0

Which simplifies to:

a^4 +2a²b² +8a²b -2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +26b^2 +56b +49=0

Hmm, this still looks quite complicated. Maybe there&#x27;s a different approach here. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z - i|

Perhaps instead of substituting z = x + yi, I can interpret this geometrically. Let me recall that for complex numbers, |A - B| represents the distance between points A and B in the complex plane.

But here, the equation is |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Hmm, that&#x27;s not a straightforward distance. Alternatively, maybe I can see (z + i)^2 as some transformation of z. Squaring a complex number can be seen as a geometric transformation: squaring the modulus and doubling the angle. But I&#x27;m not sure how that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe set w = z + i, so z = w - i. Then the equation becomes |w² - 3| = 2|w - 2i|

But maybe this substitution can help. Let me check:

Original substitution: z = w - i, so z + i = w, and z - i = w - 2i. Then the equation |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

So we have |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Maybe this is easier to handle. Let me denote w = a + bi. Then w² = (a + bi)^2 = a² - b² + 2abi. Then w² - 3 = (a² - b² -3) + 2abi. The modulus of this is sqrt[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] and the right side is 2*sqrt[a² + (b - 2)^2]. Then squaring both sides:

[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] = 4[a² + (b -2)^2]

But this seems similar to the previous approach. Maybe expanding this will lead to the same equation.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a parametrization or polar coordinates. Let me try that. Let me set w = r e^{iθ}, where r = |w|, θ is the argument.

Then |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Expressing in polar coordinates:

|r² e^{i2θ} -3| = 2 | r e^{iθ} - 2i|

But this might not lead to an easy equation either. Let me compute both sides.

Left side modulus: |r² e^{i2θ} -3|. This is the distance from the point (r² cos 2θ, r² sin 2θ) to (3, 0).

Right side: 2|r e^{iθ} - 2i| = 2| (r cos θ) + i(r sin θ - 2)| = 2 sqrt[ (r cos θ)^2 + (r sin θ -2)^2 ]

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps consider specific points. For example, if z is real, then z = x, so y =0. Then compute if that satisfies the equation.

But maybe that&#x27;s too restrictive. The minimum |z| might not occur on the real axis. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus. Let me consider that |z| is the distance from the origin, and we need to minimize this distance subject to the constraint |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. So this is an optimization problem with a constraint. Maybe Lagrange multipliers?

Yes, that&#x27;s a possible approach. Let me try that.

Let me denote z = x + yi. Then |z| = sqrt(x² + y²). We need to minimize x² + y² (since sqrt is increasing, minimizing sqrt(x² + y²) is equivalent to minimizing x² + y²).

The constraint is |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0. Let me denote f(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

So using Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of the objective function and the constraint should be proportional.

The objective function is F(x, y) = x² + y².

The constraint is G(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

Compute ∇F = [2x, 2y]

Compute ∇G. This is a bit involved, but let&#x27;s recall that for a function G(x,y) = |A(x, y)| - |B(x, y)|, the gradient is (∇|A| - ∇|B|). So need to compute gradients of |(z +i)^2 -3| and 2|z -i|.

Let me first compute |(z +i)^2 -3|.

Let me denote A = (z +i)^2 -3. Then |A| is modulus of A.

Express A in terms of x and y. As earlier, z = x + yi, so z +i = x + (y +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = x² - (y +1)^2 + 2x(y +1)i. Then subtract 3: [x² - (y +1)^2 -3] + 2x(y +1)i. So A = u + vi where u = x² - (y +1)^2 -3 and v = 2x(y +1).

Thus, |A| = sqrt(u² + v²). The gradient of |A| is ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) )

Similarly, |B| where B = z -i = x + (y -1)i, so |B| = sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2). The gradient of |B| is (x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2), (y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2))

Therefore, gradient of G = ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*(x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*((y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)) )

This seems very complicated, but maybe at the minimal point, there is some symmetry or simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps parameterizing the problem. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|

Let me let z -i = w. Then z = w + i. Then z + i = w + 2i. So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)^2 -3| = 2|w|

So |w² +4i w -4 -3| =2|w|, since (w + 2i)^2 = w² +4i w + (2i)^2 = w² +4i w -4. Then subtract 3: w² +4i w -7.

Thus, |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|

Hmm, maybe if I write this as |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|, perhaps dividing both sides by |w| (assuming w ≠0):

| w +4i -7/w | =2

But not sure if this helps. Let me check:

If w ≠0, then divide both sides by |w|:

| (w² +4i w -7)/w | =2 =&gt; |w +4i -7/w| =2

But this might not necessarily help. Alternatively, set t = w, then |t² +4i t -7| =2|t|. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |t² +4i t -7|² =4|t|²

So (t² +4i t -7)(\overline{t² +4i t -7}) =4|t|²

But this is getting too algebraic. Let me try to write t as x + yi.

Let t = x + yi. Then t² = (x + yi)^2 = x² - y² + 2xyi

4i t =4i(x + yi) = -4y +4x i

So t² +4i t -7 = (x² - y² -4y -7) + (2xy +4x)i

Thus, modulus squared is (x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4(x² + y²)

So equation:

(x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4x² +4y²

Wait, this is the same equation I had earlier when substituting w = t = z -i. So seems like we end up at the same quartic equation. Maybe expanding is the way to go.

Let me try expanding the left side:

First term: (x² - y² -4y -7)^2

Let me expand this:

= (x²)^2 + (-y² -4y -7)^2 + 2x²*(-y² -4y -7)

= x^4 + (y^4 +16y² +49 +8y^3 +14y² +56y) + (-2x²y² -8x²y -14x²)

Wait, similar to before:

Wait, (-y² -4y -7)^2 = (y² +4y +7)^2 = y^4 +8y^3 + (16y² +14y²) +56y +49 = y^4 +8y^3 +30y^2 +56y +49

And the cross term is 2x²*(-y² -4y -7) = -2x²y² -8x²y -14x²

Second term: (2xy +4x)^2 =4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

So left side total:

x^4 + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -2x²y² -8x²y -14x² +4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

Combine like terms:

x^4 + [y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49] + [(-2x²y² +4x²y²) + (-8x²y +16x²y) + (-14x² +16x²)]

Simplify each group:

x^4 remains.

y terms: y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

x²y² terms: (-2 +4)x²y² =2x²y²

x²y terms: (-8 +16)x²y =8x²y

x² terms: (-14 +16)x² =2x²

So left side becomes:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

Set equal to right side 4x² +4y²:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 =4x² +4y²

Bring all terms to left side:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -4x² -4y²=0

Simplify:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y + (2x² -4x²) + y^4 +8y^3 + (30y² -4y²) +56y +49=0

Which simplifies to:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y -2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

This equation is still very complicated. Maybe factorizing or looking for possible substitutions.

Alternatively, maybe trying specific values. For example, suppose x =0. Then the equation becomes:

0 +0 +0 -0 + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

Which is y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0. Let me check if this has real roots. Hmm, possible rational roots are ±1,±7,±49. Testing y = -1:

1 -8 +26 -56 +49 =12 ≠0

y=-7: (-7)^4 +8*(-7)^3 +26*(-7)^2 +56*(-7) +49=2401 -2744 +1274 -392 +49= 2401 -2744= -343; -343 +1274=931; 931 -392=539; 539 +49=588≠0

Not zero. Maybe it factors into quadratics?

Suppose y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49 = (y² + a y + b)(y² +c y +d)

Multiply out:

y^4 + (a +c)y³ + (ac +b +d)y² + (ad + bc)y + bd

Set coefficients:

a +c=8

ac +b +d=26

ad + bc=56

bd=49

Since bd=49, possible pairs (b,d)=(7,7), (49,1), (-7,-7), etc. Let&#x27;s try positive integers first. 7 and7. Then b=7, d=7.

Then a +c=8

ac +7 +7=26 =&gt; ac=12

ad + bc=56 =&gt;7a +7c=56 =&gt;a +c=8. Which matches the first equation. So from a +c=8 and ac=12. Solving:

a and c are roots of t² -8t +12=0. Which factors as (t -6)(t -2)=0. So a=6, c=2 or a=2, c=6.

Check ad + bc: if a=6, c=2, then 7*6 +7*2=42 +14=56. Yes, works. Similarly if a=2, c=6: 7*2 +7*6=14 +42=56. So works.

Therefore, the quartic factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0

So setting x=0, the equation factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0. The roots would be y = [-6 ±sqrt(36 -28)]/2 = [-6 ±sqrt(8)]/2 = [-6 ±2√2]/2 = -3 ±√2. Similarly for the other quadratic: y = [-2 ±sqrt(4 -28)]/2. But sqrt(-24) is imaginary. So real roots are y = -3 +√2 and y = -3 -√2. But since x=0, then z =0 + yi -i = y -i. Wait, no. Wait, we set t = z -i =w, then x and y are coordinates of w. So z = w +i. If w has x=0, then z =0 + (y +1)i. So |z| = sqrt(0 + (y +1)^2) = |y +1|. The real roots for y are -3 ±√2. So |z| would be | (-3 ±√2 ) +1 | = | -2 ±√2 |. So |-2 +√2| and |-2 -√2|. Since √2≈1.414, so -2 +1.414≈-0.586, absolute value≈0.586. The other is |-2 -1.414|=3.414. So minimum |z| is approximately 0.586 when x=0. But is this the minimal overall? Because maybe when x≠0, we can get a smaller |z|.

But first, let&#x27;s check if these points are indeed solutions. If x=0 and y = -3 +√2, then w =0 + (-3 +√2)i, so z = w +i = (-3 +√2)i +i = (-2 +√2)i. Then |z| = | -2 +√2 | ≈0.586. Similarly, the other root gives |z|=3.414. So perhaps 2 -√2 is approximately0.586, which is 2 -1.414≈0.586.

But the question is whether there are other solutions with x≠0 that have smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal |z| occurs on the y-axis (x=0). Let me check that.

If x=0, then z = (0) + (y +1)i. So |z| is |y +1|. The minimal |y +1| occurs at y = -1, which gives |z|=0. But does y=-1 satisfy the equation? Let&#x27;s check.

If x=0 and y=-1, then w = z -i = (0 + (-1)i) -i = -2i. Then check |(w +2i)^2 -3| = |(-2i +2i)^2 -3| = |0 -3| =3. And 2|w| =2*| -2i | =4. 3≠4, so y=-1 is not a solution.

Wait, but when x=0, we had solutions at y= -3 ±√2. The minimal |z| for x=0 is | -2 +√2 |≈0.586. Let&#x27;s see if we can find a solution with x≠0 that has a smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal occurs at another point. Let me consider that |z| is minimal when z is closest to the origin on the curve defined by |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Maybe this curve is a circle or some conic section.

Alternatively, notice that the original equation can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Let me consider squaring both sides:

|(z +i)^2 -3|² = 4|z -i|²

Which can be written as [(z +i)^2 -3][\overline{(z +i)^2 -3}] =4(z -i)(\overline{z -i})

But this might not help unless expanded. Let me try writing z = x + yi and expanding everything again.

Alternatively, maybe notice that (z +i)^2 -3 is a quadratic in z, so the equation represents some quadratic curve. The set of points z where |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i| is likely a circle or an ellipse or hyperbola.

Alternatively, think of this as |(z +i)^2 -3| / |z -i| =2. So the ratio of distances is 2, which resembles the definition of an Apollonius circle. However, typically, Apollonius circle is |z -a| / |z -b| =k, which is a circle. But here, the numerator is |(z +i)^2 -3|, which is not a linear function, so the locus is not a circle. So maybe it&#x27;s a quartic curve.

Given that, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs at one of the points we found on the y-axis. But to confirm, perhaps consider other points.

Alternatively, parameterize the problem with z = ti where t is real. Let me try z = ti, then |z| = |t|. Let&#x27;s check if this satisfies the equation.

z = ti, so z +i = ti +i = (t +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = -(t +1)^2. Then (z +i)^2 -3 = - (t +1)^2 -3. The modulus is | - (t +1)^2 -3 | = (t +1)^2 +3.

On the other side, 2|z -i| =2| ti -i | =2| (t -1)i | =2|t -1|

So the equation becomes (t +1)^2 +3 =2|t -1|

Let me solve this equation.

Case 1: t &gt;=1. Then |t -1|=t -1.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3 =2(t -1)

Expand left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2t -2

So t² +2t +4 =2t -2

t² +6=0. No real solutions.

Case 2: t &lt;1. Then |t -1|=1 -t.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3=2(1 -t)

Left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2 -2t

So t² +2t +4 =2 -2t

t² +4t +2 =0

Solutions: t = [-4 ±sqrt(16 -8)]/2 =[-4 ±sqrt(8)]/2 =[-4 ±2√2]/2= -2 ±√2

So t = -2 +√2≈-0.585 and t=-2 -√2≈-3.414

Check if these are less than1: yes, both are.

So z =ti, so |z| =|t|. So the |z| for these solutions are |-2 +√2|≈0.586 and |-2 -√2|≈3.414. So same as before. So when z is purely imaginary, the minimal |z| is 2 -√2≈0.5857.

But is this the minimal overall? Maybe there are other points not on the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

To check, let&#x27;s suppose that minimal |z| occurs at a point not on the y-axis, so x≠0. To verify, perhaps set y such that the derivative is zero, but given the complexity of the equation, this might be difficult.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal |z| is achieved when z is colinear with the origin and the center of some circle... Wait, but the problem is that the equation is not a circle.

Alternatively, use the triangle inequality. Let me see:

We have |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

Note that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= ||(z +i)^2| -|3|| by the reverse triangle inequality. But not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, expand (z +i)^2 -3:

(z +i)^2 -3 = z² +2i z -1 -3 =z² +2i z -4

So the equation is |z² +2i z -4| =2|z -i|

Hmm, still not helpful. Let me see:

If I let z =0, then |0 +0 -4|=4, and 2|0 -i|=2*1=2. So 4≠2, so z=0 is not a solution.

If z approaches 0, then |z² +2i z -4| ≈4, and 2|z -i|≈2*1=2, so LHS &gt;RHS near z=0. So the minimal |z| must be somewhere else.

Alternatively, consider parametrizing z in terms of |z|. Let me write z = r e^{iθ}, then |z|=r. Then we need to express the equation in terms of r and θ.

But this might be complicated. Let me attempt it.

Express z = r e^{iθ}. Then z +i = r e^{iθ} +i. Let me compute (z +i)^2:

(z +i)^2 = (r e^{iθ} +i)^2 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -1

Therefore, (z +i)^2 -3 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4

So modulus squared is |r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4|² = [r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2

And the right side is 2|z -i| =2| r e^{iθ} -i | =2 sqrt(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

So squaring both sides:

[r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2 =4(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

This equation relates r and θ. To find the minimal r, we can try to analyze this equation.

This looks very involved, but perhaps consider specific angles θ where the equation simplifies.

For instance, let me consider θ = -π/2, which would align z along the negative imaginary axis. Then z = -r i.

Compute left side:

[r² cos(-π) -4]^2 + [r² sin(-π) +2r cos(-π/2)]^2

= [r²*(-1) -4]^2 + [0 +2r*0]^2

= (-r² -4)^2 +0 = (r² +4)^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r*(-1))=4(r² +1 +2r)=4r² +4 +8r

Set equal:

(r² +4)^2 =4r² +8r +4

Expand left: r^4 +8r² +16

So equation: r^4 +8r² +16 =4r² +8r +4

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +4r² -8r +12=0

Not sure if this factors. Testing r=1:1 +4 -8 +12=9≠0

r=2:16 +16 -16 +12=28≠0

No obvious roots. So θ=-π/2 might not yield solutions.

Alternatively, take θ=0, so z is real positive. Then z =r.

Left side:

[r² cos0 -4]^2 +[r² sin0 +2r cos0]^2

= (r² -4)^2 + (0 +2r)^2 = (r² -4)^2 +4r²

Right side:

4(r² +1 -0)=4r² +4

Set equal:

(r² -4)^2 +4r² =4r² +4

Simplify: (r² -4)^2 =4

Take sqrt: r² -4=±2

Case1: r² -4=2 =&gt;r²=6 =&gt;r=√6≈2.449

Case2: r² -4=-2 =&gt;r²=2 =&gt;r=√2≈1.414

So θ=0, solutions at r=√2 and r=√6. So |z|=√2≈1.414 and √6≈2.449. But earlier, on the imaginary axis, we had |z|=2 -√2≈0.586, which is smaller. So these are not minimal.

Alternatively, check θ=π/2, z=ri, but already considered that case.

Alternatively, suppose θ=π/4. Then z = r e^{iπ/4}= r(√2/2 +i√2/2)

Compute left side:

[r² cos(π/2) -4]^2 + [r² sin(π/2) +2r cos(π/4)]^2

= [0 -4]^2 + [r²*1 +2r*(√2/2)]^2

=16 + [r² +√2 r]^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r sin(π/4))=4(r² +1 -2r*(√2/2))=4(r² +1 -√2 r)

Set equal:

16 + (r² +√2 r)^2 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Expand left:

16 +r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r²

Equation:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r² +16 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 -2r² +4√2 r +12=0

This seems difficult to solve. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis, as previously found. To confirm, maybe check another angle.

Alternatively, notice that when we substituted z =ti (i.e., x=0), we found solutions with |z|=2 -√2 and 2 +√2. The smaller one is 2 -√2≈0.5858.

But we need to check if there are any other solutions off the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

Suppose there exists a point z with |z| &lt;2 -√2. Let me assume such a point exists and see if it leads to a contradiction.

Let |z|=r &lt;2 -√2≈0.5858.

But since |z -i| &gt;= | |z| - |i| | = |r -1|. So 2|z -i| &gt;=2(1 -r)

On the other hand, |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= |(z +i)^2| +| -3| = |z +i|² +3. Since |z +i| &lt;=|z| +|i|=r +1. So |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

But we have equality |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So if 2(1 -r) &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

Let me check if this holds for r &lt;2 -√2.

Compute RHS - LHS = (r +1)^2 +3 -2(1 -r)=r² +2r +1 +3 -2 +2r=r² +4r +2

Which is positive for all real r. So this inequality holds for any r, but that doesn&#x27;t give us a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps using other inequalities. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= | |(z +i)^2| - |3| |. Which is | |z +i|² -3 |.

So we have | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;= |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;=2|z -i|

But not sure how helpful this is.

Alternatively, let me assume that the minimal |z| occurs at the point we found on the imaginary axis, 2 -√2≈0.586, and check if there can be any other points with smaller |z|.

Alternatively, note that the equation |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i| can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3|² =4|z -i|², which is the equation we derived earlier. If we assume that the minimal |z| occurs at a point where the gradient is colinear with the position vector, i.e., the point where the curve is tangent to the circle centered at the origin. But calculating this would require using Lagrange multipliers, which is quite involved given the complexity of the equation.

Alternatively, given the earlier solutions on the imaginary axis and given that when minimizing |z|, the closest point might lie on the imaginary axis due to symmetry. Since the equation involves z +i and z -i, which are vertical translations, it&#x27;s possible that the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal value we found is 2 -√2≈0.5858, and since we couldn&#x27;t find any solution with smaller |z|, and given the symmetry, this might be the minimal value.

Therefore, I think the minimal |z| is 2 -√2, achieved when z is on the imaginary axis at z=(-2 +√2)i, so |z|=| -2 +√2 | =2 -√2.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the minimum value of \(|z|\) for complex numbers \(z\) satisfying the equation \(|(z + i)^2 - 3| = 2|z - i|\), we start by substituting \(z = w + i\) where \(w = z - i\). This transforms the equation into \(|(w + 2i)^2 - 3| = 2|w|\).

We then consider \(w = x + yi\) and substitute into the equation. After expanding and simplifying both sides, we find that the equation becomes complex. However, by considering specific cases where \(w\) is purely imaginary (i.e., \(x = 0\)), we simplify the problem.

Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation, we solve for \(y\) and find the roots \(y = -3 \pm \sqrt{2}\). Translating back to \(z\), we get \(z = (-2 + \sqrt{2})i\) and \(z = (-2 - \sqrt{2})i\). The modulus \(|z|\) for these points is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} |\) and \(| -2 - \sqrt{2} |\), respectively.

The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} | = 2 - \sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The question is asking for the minimum value of |z| where z is a complex number that satisfies the equation |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Hmm, complex numbers and modulus... I remember that complex numbers can be represented in the complex plane, so maybe I can translate this equation into geometric terms?

First, let me recall that for a complex number z = x + yi, |z| is the modulus, which is √(x² + y²). So |z| represents the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) in the plane. The problem wants the minimum such distance among all z that satisfy the given equation.

The equation given is |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Let me try to break this down. Let&#x27;s substitute z = x + yi into the equation. Then z + i = x + (y + 1)i. Squaring that gives (x + (y + 1)i)². Let me compute that:

(x + (y + 1)i)² = x² + 2x(y + 1)i + [(y + 1)i]²
= x² + 2x(y + 1)i - (y + 1)²
= (x² - (y + 1)²) + 2x(y + 1)i

So (z + i)² - 3 would be [(x² - (y + 1)²) - 3] + 2x(y + 1)i. Then the modulus of this is equal to 2|z - i|. Let&#x27;s compute both sides.

Left side modulus: sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side: 2|z - i| = 2| x + (y - 1)i | = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

So, the equation becomes:

sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²] = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

Hmm, that looks complicated. Maybe squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots would help. Let me try that.

Left side squared: [(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side squared: 4(x² + (y - 1)²)

So expanding the left side:

First, let me denote A = x² - (y + 1)² - 3, and B = 2x(y + 1). Then the left side squared is A² + B².

Compute A²:

[x² - (y + 1)² - 3]^2

Let me expand (y + 1)² first: y² + 2y + 1. So x² - (y² + 2y + 1) - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 1 - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 4.

Therefore, A = x² - y² - 2y - 4, so A² = (x² - y² - 2y - 4)²

Similarly, B = 2x(y + 1), so B² = 4x²(y + 1)²

So left side squared becomes:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4(x² + (y - 1)^2)

Let me expand the right side:

4(x² + y² - 2y + 1) = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

So now, the equation is:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

Hmm, this seems really messy. Maybe there&#x27;s a better way to approach this problem instead of expanding everything. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let w = z - i. Then z = w + i. Let me substitute that into the original equation.

So, |(w + i + i)² - 3| = 2|w + i - i| =&gt; |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

Maybe this substitution simplifies things. Let&#x27;s denote w = a + bi. Then w + 2i = a + (b + 2)i. Then (w + 2i)² is [a + (b + 2)i]² = a² + 2a(b + 2)i + [(b + 2)i]^2 = a² + 2a(b + 2)i - (b + 2)^2

So (w + 2i)^2 - 3 = [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3] + 2a(b + 2)i

Then the modulus squared is [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4|w|^2 = 4(a² + b²)

So expanding the left side:

[a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4(a² + b²)

Let me compute [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2. First, expand (b + 2)^2: b² + 4b + 4. So a² - b² -4b -4 -3 = a² - b² -4b -7. So the first term is (a² - b² -4b -7)^2.

Second term: [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4a²(b + 2)^2

So left side becomes:

(a² - b² -4b -7)^2 + 4a²(b + 2)^2 = 4a² + 4b²

This still seems complicated, but maybe expanding the left side will lead to some cancellation.

First, let&#x27;s expand (a² - b² -4b -7)^2:

= (a²)^2 + (-b² -4b -7)^2 + 2a²(-b² -4b -7)

= a^4 + (b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b² + 56b) + (-2a²b² -8a²b -14a²)

Wait, that&#x27;s a bit messy. Let me do it step by step.

Let me denote C = a² and D = -b² -4b -7. Then (C + D)^2 = C² + 2CD + D².

C² = (a²)^2 = a^4

2CD = 2a²(-b² -4b -7) = -2a²b² -8a²b -14a²

D² = (-b² -4b -7)^2. Let&#x27;s compute that:

= (b² +4b +7)^2

= (b²)^2 + (4b)^2 + (7)^2 + 2*b²*4b + 2*b²*7 + 2*4b*7

= b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b^2 + 56b

= b^4 + 8b^3 + (16b^2 +14b^2) +56b +49

= b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So D² = b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So putting it all together, (a² - b² -4b -7)^2 = a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, adding the second term: 4a²(b + 2)^2

First compute (b + 2)^2 = b² +4b +4. Then 4a²*(b² +4b +4) = 4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

So the entire left side becomes:

a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 +4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

a^4: a^4

a²b² terms: -2a²b² +4a²b² = 2a²b²

a²b terms: -8a²b +16a²b = 8a²b

a² terms: -14a² +16a² = 2a²

b^4: b^4

b^3:8b^3

b^2:30b^2

b terms:56b

constants:49

So left side simplifies to:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, the right side is 4a² +4b²

Therefore, the equation is:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 = 4a² +4b²

Bringing all terms to the left side:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 -4a² -4b² =0

Simplify:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b + (2a² -4a²) + b^4 +8b^3 + (30b^2 -4b^2) +56b +49 =0

Which simplifies to:

a^4 +2a²b² +8a²b -2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +26b^2 +56b +49=0

Hmm, this still looks quite complicated. Maybe there&#x27;s a different approach here. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z - i|

Perhaps instead of substituting z = x + yi, I can interpret this geometrically. Let me recall that for complex numbers, |A - B| represents the distance between points A and B in the complex plane.

But here, the equation is |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Hmm, that&#x27;s not a straightforward distance. Alternatively, maybe I can see (z + i)^2 as some transformation of z. Squaring a complex number can be seen as a geometric transformation: squaring the modulus and doubling the angle. But I&#x27;m not sure how that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe set w = z + i, so z = w - i. Then the equation becomes |w² - 3| = 2|w - 2i|

But maybe this substitution can help. Let me check:

Original substitution: z = w - i, so z + i = w, and z - i = w - 2i. Then the equation |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

So we have |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Maybe this is easier to handle. Let me denote w = a + bi. Then w² = (a + bi)^2 = a² - b² + 2abi. Then w² - 3 = (a² - b² -3) + 2abi. The modulus of this is sqrt[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] and the right side is 2*sqrt[a² + (b - 2)^2]. Then squaring both sides:

[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] = 4[a² + (b -2)^2]

But this seems similar to the previous approach. Maybe expanding this will lead to the same equation.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a parametrization or polar coordinates. Let me try that. Let me set w = r e^{iθ}, where r = |w|, θ is the argument.

Then |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Expressing in polar coordinates:

|r² e^{i2θ} -3| = 2 | r e^{iθ} - 2i|

But this might not lead to an easy equation either. Let me compute both sides.

Left side modulus: |r² e^{i2θ} -3|. This is the distance from the point (r² cos 2θ, r² sin 2θ) to (3, 0).

Right side: 2|r e^{iθ} - 2i| = 2| (r cos θ) + i(r sin θ - 2)| = 2 sqrt[ (r cos θ)^2 + (r sin θ -2)^2 ]

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps consider specific points. For example, if z is real, then z = x, so y =0. Then compute if that satisfies the equation.

But maybe that&#x27;s too restrictive. The minimum |z| might not occur on the real axis. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus. Let me consider that |z| is the distance from the origin, and we need to minimize this distance subject to the constraint |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. So this is an optimization problem with a constraint. Maybe Lagrange multipliers?

Yes, that&#x27;s a possible approach. Let me try that.

Let me denote z = x + yi. Then |z| = sqrt(x² + y²). We need to minimize x² + y² (since sqrt is increasing, minimizing sqrt(x² + y²) is equivalent to minimizing x² + y²).

The constraint is |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0. Let me denote f(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

So using Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of the objective function and the constraint should be proportional.

The objective function is F(x, y) = x² + y².

The constraint is G(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

Compute ∇F = [2x, 2y]

Compute ∇G. This is a bit involved, but let&#x27;s recall that for a function G(x,y) = |A(x, y)| - |B(x, y)|, the gradient is (∇|A| - ∇|B|). So need to compute gradients of |(z +i)^2 -3| and 2|z -i|.

Let me first compute |(z +i)^2 -3|.

Let me denote A = (z +i)^2 -3. Then |A| is modulus of A.

Express A in terms of x and y. As earlier, z = x + yi, so z +i = x + (y +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = x² - (y +1)^2 + 2x(y +1)i. Then subtract 3: [x² - (y +1)^2 -3] + 2x(y +1)i. So A = u + vi where u = x² - (y +1)^2 -3 and v = 2x(y +1).

Thus, |A| = sqrt(u² + v²). The gradient of |A| is ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) )

Similarly, |B| where B = z -i = x + (y -1)i, so |B| = sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2). The gradient of |B| is (x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2), (y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2))

Therefore, gradient of G = ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*(x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*((y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)) )

This seems very complicated, but maybe at the minimal point, there is some symmetry or simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps parameterizing the problem. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|

Let me let z -i = w. Then z = w + i. Then z + i = w + 2i. So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)^2 -3| = 2|w|

So |w² +4i w -4 -3| =2|w|, since (w + 2i)^2 = w² +4i w + (2i)^2 = w² +4i w -4. Then subtract 3: w² +4i w -7.

Thus, |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|

Hmm, maybe if I write this as |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|, perhaps dividing both sides by |w| (assuming w ≠0):

| w +4i -7/w | =2

But not sure if this helps. Let me check:

If w ≠0, then divide both sides by |w|:

| (w² +4i w -7)/w | =2 =&gt; |w +4i -7/w| =2

But this might not necessarily help. Alternatively, set t = w, then |t² +4i t -7| =2|t|. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |t² +4i t -7|² =4|t|²

So (t² +4i t -7)(\overline{t² +4i t -7}) =4|t|²

But this is getting too algebraic. Let me try to write t as x + yi.

Let t = x + yi. Then t² = (x + yi)^2 = x² - y² + 2xyi

4i t =4i(x + yi) = -4y +4x i

So t² +4i t -7 = (x² - y² -4y -7) + (2xy +4x)i

Thus, modulus squared is (x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4(x² + y²)

So equation:

(x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4x² +4y²

Wait, this is the same equation I had earlier when substituting w = t = z -i. So seems like we end up at the same quartic equation. Maybe expanding is the way to go.

Let me try expanding the left side:

First term: (x² - y² -4y -7)^2

Let me expand this:

= (x²)^2 + (-y² -4y -7)^2 + 2x²*(-y² -4y -7)

= x^4 + (y^4 +16y² +49 +8y^3 +14y² +56y) + (-2x²y² -8x²y -14x²)

Wait, similar to before:

Wait, (-y² -4y -7)^2 = (y² +4y +7)^2 = y^4 +8y^3 + (16y² +14y²) +56y +49 = y^4 +8y^3 +30y^2 +56y +49

And the cross term is 2x²*(-y² -4y -7) = -2x²y² -8x²y -14x²

Second term: (2xy +4x)^2 =4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

So left side total:

x^4 + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -2x²y² -8x²y -14x² +4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

Combine like terms:

x^4 + [y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49] + [(-2x²y² +4x²y²) + (-8x²y +16x²y) + (-14x² +16x²)]

Simplify each group:

x^4 remains.

y terms: y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

x²y² terms: (-2 +4)x²y² =2x²y²

x²y terms: (-8 +16)x²y =8x²y

x² terms: (-14 +16)x² =2x²

So left side becomes:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

Set equal to right side 4x² +4y²:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 =4x² +4y²

Bring all terms to left side:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -4x² -4y²=0

Simplify:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y + (2x² -4x²) + y^4 +8y^3 + (30y² -4y²) +56y +49=0

Which simplifies to:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y -2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

This equation is still very complicated. Maybe factorizing or looking for possible substitutions.

Alternatively, maybe trying specific values. For example, suppose x =0. Then the equation becomes:

0 +0 +0 -0 + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

Which is y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0. Let me check if this has real roots. Hmm, possible rational roots are ±1,±7,±49. Testing y = -1:

1 -8 +26 -56 +49 =12 ≠0

y=-7: (-7)^4 +8*(-7)^3 +26*(-7)^2 +56*(-7) +49=2401 -2744 +1274 -392 +49= 2401 -2744= -343; -343 +1274=931; 931 -392=539; 539 +49=588≠0

Not zero. Maybe it factors into quadratics?

Suppose y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49 = (y² + a y + b)(y² +c y +d)

Multiply out:

y^4 + (a +c)y³ + (ac +b +d)y² + (ad + bc)y + bd

Set coefficients:

a +c=8

ac +b +d=26

ad + bc=56

bd=49

Since bd=49, possible pairs (b,d)=(7,7), (49,1), (-7,-7), etc. Let&#x27;s try positive integers first. 7 and7. Then b=7, d=7.

Then a +c=8

ac +7 +7=26 =&gt; ac=12

ad + bc=56 =&gt;7a +7c=56 =&gt;a +c=8. Which matches the first equation. So from a +c=8 and ac=12. Solving:

a and c are roots of t² -8t +12=0. Which factors as (t -6)(t -2)=0. So a=6, c=2 or a=2, c=6.

Check ad + bc: if a=6, c=2, then 7*6 +7*2=42 +14=56. Yes, works. Similarly if a=2, c=6: 7*2 +7*6=14 +42=56. So works.

Therefore, the quartic factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0

So setting x=0, the equation factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0. The roots would be y = [-6 ±sqrt(36 -28)]/2 = [-6 ±sqrt(8)]/2 = [-6 ±2√2]/2 = -3 ±√2. Similarly for the other quadratic: y = [-2 ±sqrt(4 -28)]/2. But sqrt(-24) is imaginary. So real roots are y = -3 +√2 and y = -3 -√2. But since x=0, then z =0 + yi -i = y -i. Wait, no. Wait, we set t = z -i =w, then x and y are coordinates of w. So z = w +i. If w has x=0, then z =0 + (y +1)i. So |z| = sqrt(0 + (y +1)^2) = |y +1|. The real roots for y are -3 ±√2. So |z| would be | (-3 ±√2 ) +1 | = | -2 ±√2 |. So |-2 +√2| and |-2 -√2|. Since √2≈1.414, so -2 +1.414≈-0.586, absolute value≈0.586. The other is |-2 -1.414|=3.414. So minimum |z| is approximately 0.586 when x=0. But is this the minimal overall? Because maybe when x≠0, we can get a smaller |z|.

But first, let&#x27;s check if these points are indeed solutions. If x=0 and y = -3 +√2, then w =0 + (-3 +√2)i, so z = w +i = (-3 +√2)i +i = (-2 +√2)i. Then |z| = | -2 +√2 | ≈0.586. Similarly, the other root gives |z|=3.414. So perhaps 2 -√2 is approximately0.586, which is 2 -1.414≈0.586.

But the question is whether there are other solutions with x≠0 that have smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal |z| occurs on the y-axis (x=0). Let me check that.

If x=0, then z = (0) + (y +1)i. So |z| is |y +1|. The minimal |y +1| occurs at y = -1, which gives |z|=0. But does y=-1 satisfy the equation? Let&#x27;s check.

If x=0 and y=-1, then w = z -i = (0 + (-1)i) -i = -2i. Then check |(w +2i)^2 -3| = |(-2i +2i)^2 -3| = |0 -3| =3. And 2|w| =2*| -2i | =4. 3≠4, so y=-1 is not a solution.

Wait, but when x=0, we had solutions at y= -3 ±√2. The minimal |z| for x=0 is | -2 +√2 |≈0.586. Let&#x27;s see if we can find a solution with x≠0 that has a smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal occurs at another point. Let me consider that |z| is minimal when z is closest to the origin on the curve defined by |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Maybe this curve is a circle or some conic section.

Alternatively, notice that the original equation can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Let me consider squaring both sides:

|(z +i)^2 -3|² = 4|z -i|²

Which can be written as [(z +i)^2 -3][\overline{(z +i)^2 -3}] =4(z -i)(\overline{z -i})

But this might not help unless expanded. Let me try writing z = x + yi and expanding everything again.

Alternatively, maybe notice that (z +i)^2 -3 is a quadratic in z, so the equation represents some quadratic curve. The set of points z where |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i| is likely a circle or an ellipse or hyperbola.

Alternatively, think of this as |(z +i)^2 -3| / |z -i| =2. So the ratio of distances is 2, which resembles the definition of an Apollonius circle. However, typically, Apollonius circle is |z -a| / |z -b| =k, which is a circle. But here, the numerator is |(z +i)^2 -3|, which is not a linear function, so the locus is not a circle. So maybe it&#x27;s a quartic curve.

Given that, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs at one of the points we found on the y-axis. But to confirm, perhaps consider other points.

Alternatively, parameterize the problem with z = ti where t is real. Let me try z = ti, then |z| = |t|. Let&#x27;s check if this satisfies the equation.

z = ti, so z +i = ti +i = (t +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = -(t +1)^2. Then (z +i)^2 -3 = - (t +1)^2 -3. The modulus is | - (t +1)^2 -3 | = (t +1)^2 +3.

On the other side, 2|z -i| =2| ti -i | =2| (t -1)i | =2|t -1|

So the equation becomes (t +1)^2 +3 =2|t -1|

Let me solve this equation.

Case 1: t &gt;=1. Then |t -1|=t -1.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3 =2(t -1)

Expand left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2t -2

So t² +2t +4 =2t -2

t² +6=0. No real solutions.

Case 2: t &lt;1. Then |t -1|=1 -t.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3=2(1 -t)

Left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2 -2t

So t² +2t +4 =2 -2t

t² +4t +2 =0

Solutions: t = [-4 ±sqrt(16 -8)]/2 =[-4 ±sqrt(8)]/2 =[-4 ±2√2]/2= -2 ±√2

So t = -2 +√2≈-0.585 and t=-2 -√2≈-3.414

Check if these are less than1: yes, both are.

So z =ti, so |z| =|t|. So the |z| for these solutions are |-2 +√2|≈0.586 and |-2 -√2|≈3.414. So same as before. So when z is purely imaginary, the minimal |z| is 2 -√2≈0.5857.

But is this the minimal overall? Maybe there are other points not on the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

To check, let&#x27;s suppose that minimal |z| occurs at a point not on the y-axis, so x≠0. To verify, perhaps set y such that the derivative is zero, but given the complexity of the equation, this might be difficult.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal |z| is achieved when z is colinear with the origin and the center of some circle... Wait, but the problem is that the equation is not a circle.

Alternatively, use the triangle inequality. Let me see:

We have |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

Note that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= ||(z +i)^2| -|3|| by the reverse triangle inequality. But not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, expand (z +i)^2 -3:

(z +i)^2 -3 = z² +2i z -1 -3 =z² +2i z -4

So the equation is |z² +2i z -4| =2|z -i|

Hmm, still not helpful. Let me see:

If I let z =0, then |0 +0 -4|=4, and 2|0 -i|=2*1=2. So 4≠2, so z=0 is not a solution.

If z approaches 0, then |z² +2i z -4| ≈4, and 2|z -i|≈2*1=2, so LHS &gt;RHS near z=0. So the minimal |z| must be somewhere else.

Alternatively, consider parametrizing z in terms of |z|. Let me write z = r e^{iθ}, then |z|=r. Then we need to express the equation in terms of r and θ.

But this might be complicated. Let me attempt it.

Express z = r e^{iθ}. Then z +i = r e^{iθ} +i. Let me compute (z +i)^2:

(z +i)^2 = (r e^{iθ} +i)^2 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -1

Therefore, (z +i)^2 -3 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4

So modulus squared is |r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4|² = [r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2

And the right side is 2|z -i| =2| r e^{iθ} -i | =2 sqrt(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

So squaring both sides:

[r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2 =4(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

This equation relates r and θ. To find the minimal r, we can try to analyze this equation.

This looks very involved, but perhaps consider specific angles θ where the equation simplifies.

For instance, let me consider θ = -π/2, which would align z along the negative imaginary axis. Then z = -r i.

Compute left side:

[r² cos(-π) -4]^2 + [r² sin(-π) +2r cos(-π/2)]^2

= [r²*(-1) -4]^2 + [0 +2r*0]^2

= (-r² -4)^2 +0 = (r² +4)^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r*(-1))=4(r² +1 +2r)=4r² +4 +8r

Set equal:

(r² +4)^2 =4r² +8r +4

Expand left: r^4 +8r² +16

So equation: r^4 +8r² +16 =4r² +8r +4

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +4r² -8r +12=0

Not sure if this factors. Testing r=1:1 +4 -8 +12=9≠0

r=2:16 +16 -16 +12=28≠0

No obvious roots. So θ=-π/2 might not yield solutions.

Alternatively, take θ=0, so z is real positive. Then z =r.

Left side:

[r² cos0 -4]^2 +[r² sin0 +2r cos0]^2

= (r² -4)^2 + (0 +2r)^2 = (r² -4)^2 +4r²

Right side:

4(r² +1 -0)=4r² +4

Set equal:

(r² -4)^2 +4r² =4r² +4

Simplify: (r² -4)^2 =4

Take sqrt: r² -4=±2

Case1: r² -4=2 =&gt;r²=6 =&gt;r=√6≈2.449

Case2: r² -4=-2 =&gt;r²=2 =&gt;r=√2≈1.414

So θ=0, solutions at r=√2 and r=√6. So |z|=√2≈1.414 and √6≈2.449. But earlier, on the imaginary axis, we had |z|=2 -√2≈0.586, which is smaller. So these are not minimal.

Alternatively, check θ=π/2, z=ri, but already considered that case.

Alternatively, suppose θ=π/4. Then z = r e^{iπ/4}= r(√2/2 +i√2/2)

Compute left side:

[r² cos(π/2) -4]^2 + [r² sin(π/2) +2r cos(π/4)]^2

= [0 -4]^2 + [r²*1 +2r*(√2/2)]^2

=16 + [r² +√2 r]^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r sin(π/4))=4(r² +1 -2r*(√2/2))=4(r² +1 -√2 r)

Set equal:

16 + (r² +√2 r)^2 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Expand left:

16 +r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r²

Equation:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r² +16 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 -2r² +4√2 r +12=0

This seems difficult to solve. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis, as previously found. To confirm, maybe check another angle.

Alternatively, notice that when we substituted z =ti (i.e., x=0), we found solutions with |z|=2 -√2 and 2 +√2. The smaller one is 2 -√2≈0.5858.

But we need to check if there are any other solutions off the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

Suppose there exists a point z with |z| &lt;2 -√2. Let me assume such a point exists and see if it leads to a contradiction.

Let |z|=r &lt;2 -√2≈0.5858.

But since |z -i| &gt;= | |z| - |i| | = |r -1|. So 2|z -i| &gt;=2(1 -r)

On the other hand, |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= |(z +i)^2| +| -3| = |z +i|² +3. Since |z +i| &lt;=|z| +|i|=r +1. So |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

But we have equality |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So if 2(1 -r) &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

Let me check if this holds for r &lt;2 -√2.

Compute RHS - LHS = (r +1)^2 +3 -2(1 -r)=r² +2r +1 +3 -2 +2r=r² +4r +2

Which is positive for all real r. So this inequality holds for any r, but that doesn&#x27;t give us a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps using other inequalities. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= | |(z +i)^2| - |3| |. Which is | |z +i|² -3 |.

So we have | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;= |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;=2|z -i|

But not sure how helpful this is.

Alternatively, let me assume that the minimal |z| occurs at the point we found on the imaginary axis, 2 -√2≈0.586, and check if there can be any other points with smaller |z|.

Alternatively, note that the equation |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i| can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3|² =4|z -i|², which is the equation we derived earlier. If we assume that the minimal |z| occurs at a point where the gradient is colinear with the position vector, i.e., the point where the curve is tangent to the circle centered at the origin. But calculating this would require using Lagrange multipliers, which is quite involved given the complexity of the equation.

Alternatively, given the earlier solutions on the imaginary axis and given that when minimizing |z|, the closest point might lie on the imaginary axis due to symmetry. Since the equation involves z +i and z -i, which are vertical translations, it&#x27;s possible that the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal value we found is 2 -√2≈0.5858, and since we couldn&#x27;t find any solution with smaller |z|, and given the symmetry, this might be the minimal value.

Therefore, I think the minimal |z| is 2 -√2, achieved when z is on the imaginary axis at z=(-2 +√2)i, so |z|=| -2 +√2 | =2 -√2.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the minimum value of \(|z|\) for complex numbers \(z\) satisfying the equation \(|(z + i)^2 - 3| = 2|z - i|\), we start by substituting \(z = w + i\) where \(w = z - i\). This transforms the equation into \(|(w + 2i)^2 - 3| = 2|w|\).

We then consider \(w = x + yi\) and substitute into the equation. After expanding and simplifying both sides, we find that the equation becomes complex. However, by considering specific cases where \(w\) is purely imaginary (i.e., \(x = 0\)), we simplify the problem.

Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation, we solve for \(y\) and find the roots \(y = -3 \pm \sqrt{2}\). Translating back to \(z\), we get \(z = (-2 + \sqrt{2})i\) and \(z = (-2 - \sqrt{2})i\). The modulus \(|z|\) for these points is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} |\) and \(| -2 - \sqrt{2} |\), respectively.

The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} | = 2 - \sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: One way to do this problem is to use both \(z\) and \(1/\bar{z}\). Set \(z=x+iy\) and \(1/\bar{z}=X+iy\), so \begin{eqnarray*}|z|^2 &amp;=&amp; (x+i/2)^2 +y^2 = x^2-y^2+i/2 x \end{eqnarray*} so the left side of the equation is \begin{eqnarray*} |z+i|^2 = (z^2+2z+1)^2+1 + |z-i|^2 = (x^4+x^3-2i/8 x^2+x^2-1+4 x^2+4 x+4) + (X^2-x^2)^2-2(X^2+x^2)-1 \\ &amp;=&amp; (X^2+4 x)^2+(X^2-4 x+1)^2-2X^2-2x+1 + (x^2-1)^2-2X^2-2x+1,\end{eqnarray*} which is Always positive for all complex \(z\) for which \(x^2-y^2+i/2 x \geq 0\).

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The question is asking for the minimum value of |z| where z is a complex number that satisfies the equation |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Hmm, complex numbers and modulus... I remember that complex numbers can be represented in the complex plane, so maybe I can translate this equation into geometric terms?

First, let me recall that for a complex number z = x + yi, |z| is the modulus, which is √(x² + y²). So |z| represents the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) in the plane. The problem wants the minimum such distance among all z that satisfy the given equation.

The equation given is |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Let me try to break this down. Let&#x27;s substitute z = x + yi into the equation. Then z + i = x + (y + 1)i. Squaring that gives (x + (y + 1)i)². Let me compute that:

(x + (y + 1)i)² = x² + 2x(y + 1)i + [(y + 1)i]²
= x² + 2x(y + 1)i - (y + 1)²
= (x² - (y + 1)²) + 2x(y + 1)i

So (z + i)² - 3 would be [(x² - (y + 1)²) - 3] + 2x(y + 1)i. Then the modulus of this is equal to 2|z - i|. Let&#x27;s compute both sides.

Left side modulus: sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side: 2|z - i| = 2| x + (y - 1)i | = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

So, the equation becomes:

sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²] = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

Hmm, that looks complicated. Maybe squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots would help. Let me try that.

Left side squared: [(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side squared: 4(x² + (y - 1)²)

So expanding the left side:

First, let me denote A = x² - (y + 1)² - 3, and B = 2x(y + 1). Then the left side squared is A² + B².

Compute A²:

[x² - (y + 1)² - 3]^2

Let me expand (y + 1)² first: y² + 2y + 1. So x² - (y² + 2y + 1) - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 1 - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 4.

Therefore, A = x² - y² - 2y - 4, so A² = (x² - y² - 2y - 4)²

Similarly, B = 2x(y + 1), so B² = 4x²(y + 1)²

So left side squared becomes:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4(x² + (y - 1)^2)

Let me expand the right side:

4(x² + y² - 2y + 1) = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

So now, the equation is:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

Hmm, this seems really messy. Maybe there&#x27;s a better way to approach this problem instead of expanding everything. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let w = z - i. Then z = w + i. Let me substitute that into the original equation.

So, |(w + i + i)² - 3| = 2|w + i - i| =&gt; |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

Maybe this substitution simplifies things. Let&#x27;s denote w = a + bi. Then w + 2i = a + (b + 2)i. Then (w + 2i)² is [a + (b + 2)i]² = a² + 2a(b + 2)i + [(b + 2)i]^2 = a² + 2a(b + 2)i - (b + 2)^2

So (w + 2i)^2 - 3 = [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3] + 2a(b + 2)i

Then the modulus squared is [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4|w|^2 = 4(a² + b²)

So expanding the left side:

[a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4(a² + b²)

Let me compute [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2. First, expand (b + 2)^2: b² + 4b + 4. So a² - b² -4b -4 -3 = a² - b² -4b -7. So the first term is (a² - b² -4b -7)^2.

Second term: [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4a²(b + 2)^2

So left side becomes:

(a² - b² -4b -7)^2 + 4a²(b + 2)^2 = 4a² + 4b²

This still seems complicated, but maybe expanding the left side will lead to some cancellation.

First, let&#x27;s expand (a² - b² -4b -7)^2:

= (a²)^2 + (-b² -4b -7)^2 + 2a²(-b² -4b -7)

= a^4 + (b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b² + 56b) + (-2a²b² -8a²b -14a²)

Wait, that&#x27;s a bit messy. Let me do it step by step.

Let me denote C = a² and D = -b² -4b -7. Then (C + D)^2 = C² + 2CD + D².

C² = (a²)^2 = a^4

2CD = 2a²(-b² -4b -7) = -2a²b² -8a²b -14a²

D² = (-b² -4b -7)^2. Let&#x27;s compute that:

= (b² +4b +7)^2

= (b²)^2 + (4b)^2 + (7)^2 + 2*b²*4b + 2*b²*7 + 2*4b*7

= b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b^2 + 56b

= b^4 + 8b^3 + (16b^2 +14b^2) +56b +49

= b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So D² = b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So putting it all together, (a² - b² -4b -7)^2 = a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, adding the second term: 4a²(b + 2)^2

First compute (b + 2)^2 = b² +4b +4. Then 4a²*(b² +4b +4) = 4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

So the entire left side becomes:

a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 +4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

a^4: a^4

a²b² terms: -2a²b² +4a²b² = 2a²b²

a²b terms: -8a²b +16a²b = 8a²b

a² terms: -14a² +16a² = 2a²

b^4: b^4

b^3:8b^3

b^2:30b^2

b terms:56b

constants:49

So left side simplifies to:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, the right side is 4a² +4b²

Therefore, the equation is:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 = 4a² +4b²

Bringing all terms to the left side:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 -4a² -4b² =0

Simplify:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b + (2a² -4a²) + b^4 +8b^3 + (30b^2 -4b^2) +56b +49 =0

Which simplifies to:

a^4 +2a²b² +8a²b -2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +26b^2 +56b +49=0

Hmm, this still looks quite complicated. Maybe there&#x27;s a different approach here. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z - i|

Perhaps instead of substituting z = x + yi, I can interpret this geometrically. Let me recall that for complex numbers, |A - B| represents the distance between points A and B in the complex plane.

But here, the equation is |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Hmm, that&#x27;s not a straightforward distance. Alternatively, maybe I can see (z + i)^2 as some transformation of z. Squaring a complex number can be seen as a geometric transformation: squaring the modulus and doubling the angle. But I&#x27;m not sure how that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe set w = z + i, so z = w - i. Then the equation becomes |w² - 3| = 2|w - 2i|

But maybe this substitution can help. Let me check:

Original substitution: z = w - i, so z + i = w, and z - i = w - 2i. Then the equation |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

So we have |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Maybe this is easier to handle. Let me denote w = a + bi. Then w² = (a + bi)^2 = a² - b² + 2abi. Then w² - 3 = (a² - b² -3) + 2abi. The modulus of this is sqrt[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] and the right side is 2*sqrt[a² + (b - 2)^2]. Then squaring both sides:

[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] = 4[a² + (b -2)^2]

But this seems similar to the previous approach. Maybe expanding this will lead to the same equation.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a parametrization or polar coordinates. Let me try that. Let me set w = r e^{iθ}, where r = |w|, θ is the argument.

Then |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Expressing in polar coordinates:

|r² e^{i2θ} -3| = 2 | r e^{iθ} - 2i|

But this might not lead to an easy equation either. Let me compute both sides.

Left side modulus: |r² e^{i2θ} -3|. This is the distance from the point (r² cos 2θ, r² sin 2θ) to (3, 0).

Right side: 2|r e^{iθ} - 2i| = 2| (r cos θ) + i(r sin θ - 2)| = 2 sqrt[ (r cos θ)^2 + (r sin θ -2)^2 ]

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps consider specific points. For example, if z is real, then z = x, so y =0. Then compute if that satisfies the equation.

But maybe that&#x27;s too restrictive. The minimum |z| might not occur on the real axis. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus. Let me consider that |z| is the distance from the origin, and we need to minimize this distance subject to the constraint |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. So this is an optimization problem with a constraint. Maybe Lagrange multipliers?

Yes, that&#x27;s a possible approach. Let me try that.

Let me denote z = x + yi. Then |z| = sqrt(x² + y²). We need to minimize x² + y² (since sqrt is increasing, minimizing sqrt(x² + y²) is equivalent to minimizing x² + y²).

The constraint is |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0. Let me denote f(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

So using Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of the objective function and the constraint should be proportional.

The objective function is F(x, y) = x² + y².

The constraint is G(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

Compute ∇F = [2x, 2y]

Compute ∇G. This is a bit involved, but let&#x27;s recall that for a function G(x,y) = |A(x, y)| - |B(x, y)|, the gradient is (∇|A| - ∇|B|). So need to compute gradients of |(z +i)^2 -3| and 2|z -i|.

Let me first compute |(z +i)^2 -3|.

Let me denote A = (z +i)^2 -3. Then |A| is modulus of A.

Express A in terms of x and y. As earlier, z = x + yi, so z +i = x + (y +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = x² - (y +1)^2 + 2x(y +1)i. Then subtract 3: [x² - (y +1)^2 -3] + 2x(y +1)i. So A = u + vi where u = x² - (y +1)^2 -3 and v = 2x(y +1).

Thus, |A| = sqrt(u² + v²). The gradient of |A| is ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) )

Similarly, |B| where B = z -i = x + (y -1)i, so |B| = sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2). The gradient of |B| is (x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2), (y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2))

Therefore, gradient of G = ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*(x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*((y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)) )

This seems very complicated, but maybe at the minimal point, there is some symmetry or simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps parameterizing the problem. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|

Let me let z -i = w. Then z = w + i. Then z + i = w + 2i. So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)^2 -3| = 2|w|

So |w² +4i w -4 -3| =2|w|, since (w + 2i)^2 = w² +4i w + (2i)^2 = w² +4i w -4. Then subtract 3: w² +4i w -7.

Thus, |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|

Hmm, maybe if I write this as |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|, perhaps dividing both sides by |w| (assuming w ≠0):

| w +4i -7/w | =2

But not sure if this helps. Let me check:

If w ≠0, then divide both sides by |w|:

| (w² +4i w -7)/w | =2 =&gt; |w +4i -7/w| =2

But this might not necessarily help. Alternatively, set t = w, then |t² +4i t -7| =2|t|. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |t² +4i t -7|² =4|t|²

So (t² +4i t -7)(\overline{t² +4i t -7}) =4|t|²

But this is getting too algebraic. Let me try to write t as x + yi.

Let t = x + yi. Then t² = (x + yi)^2 = x² - y² + 2xyi

4i t =4i(x + yi) = -4y +4x i

So t² +4i t -7 = (x² - y² -4y -7) + (2xy +4x)i

Thus, modulus squared is (x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4(x² + y²)

So equation:

(x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4x² +4y²

Wait, this is the same equation I had earlier when substituting w = t = z -i. So seems like we end up at the same quartic equation. Maybe expanding is the way to go.

Let me try expanding the left side:

First term: (x² - y² -4y -7)^2

Let me expand this:

= (x²)^2 + (-y² -4y -7)^2 + 2x²*(-y² -4y -7)

= x^4 + (y^4 +16y² +49 +8y^3 +14y² +56y) + (-2x²y² -8x²y -14x²)

Wait, similar to before:

Wait, (-y² -4y -7)^2 = (y² +4y +7)^2 = y^4 +8y^3 + (16y² +14y²) +56y +49 = y^4 +8y^3 +30y^2 +56y +49

And the cross term is 2x²*(-y² -4y -7) = -2x²y² -8x²y -14x²

Second term: (2xy +4x)^2 =4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

So left side total:

x^4 + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -2x²y² -8x²y -14x² +4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

Combine like terms:

x^4 + [y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49] + [(-2x²y² +4x²y²) + (-8x²y +16x²y) + (-14x² +16x²)]

Simplify each group:

x^4 remains.

y terms: y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

x²y² terms: (-2 +4)x²y² =2x²y²

x²y terms: (-8 +16)x²y =8x²y

x² terms: (-14 +16)x² =2x²

So left side becomes:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

Set equal to right side 4x² +4y²:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 =4x² +4y²

Bring all terms to left side:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -4x² -4y²=0

Simplify:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y + (2x² -4x²) + y^4 +8y^3 + (30y² -4y²) +56y +49=0

Which simplifies to:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y -2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

This equation is still very complicated. Maybe factorizing or looking for possible substitutions.

Alternatively, maybe trying specific values. For example, suppose x =0. Then the equation becomes:

0 +0 +0 -0 + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

Which is y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0. Let me check if this has real roots. Hmm, possible rational roots are ±1,±7,±49. Testing y = -1:

1 -8 +26 -56 +49 =12 ≠0

y=-7: (-7)^4 +8*(-7)^3 +26*(-7)^2 +56*(-7) +49=2401 -2744 +1274 -392 +49= 2401 -2744= -343; -343 +1274=931; 931 -392=539; 539 +49=588≠0

Not zero. Maybe it factors into quadratics?

Suppose y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49 = (y² + a y + b)(y² +c y +d)

Multiply out:

y^4 + (a +c)y³ + (ac +b +d)y² + (ad + bc)y + bd

Set coefficients:

a +c=8

ac +b +d=26

ad + bc=56

bd=49

Since bd=49, possible pairs (b,d)=(7,7), (49,1), (-7,-7), etc. Let&#x27;s try positive integers first. 7 and7. Then b=7, d=7.

Then a +c=8

ac +7 +7=26 =&gt; ac=12

ad + bc=56 =&gt;7a +7c=56 =&gt;a +c=8. Which matches the first equation. So from a +c=8 and ac=12. Solving:

a and c are roots of t² -8t +12=0. Which factors as (t -6)(t -2)=0. So a=6, c=2 or a=2, c=6.

Check ad + bc: if a=6, c=2, then 7*6 +7*2=42 +14=56. Yes, works. Similarly if a=2, c=6: 7*2 +7*6=14 +42=56. So works.

Therefore, the quartic factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0

So setting x=0, the equation factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0. The roots would be y = [-6 ±sqrt(36 -28)]/2 = [-6 ±sqrt(8)]/2 = [-6 ±2√2]/2 = -3 ±√2. Similarly for the other quadratic: y = [-2 ±sqrt(4 -28)]/2. But sqrt(-24) is imaginary. So real roots are y = -3 +√2 and y = -3 -√2. But since x=0, then z =0 + yi -i = y -i. Wait, no. Wait, we set t = z -i =w, then x and y are coordinates of w. So z = w +i. If w has x=0, then z =0 + (y +1)i. So |z| = sqrt(0 + (y +1)^2) = |y +1|. The real roots for y are -3 ±√2. So |z| would be | (-3 ±√2 ) +1 | = | -2 ±√2 |. So |-2 +√2| and |-2 -√2|. Since √2≈1.414, so -2 +1.414≈-0.586, absolute value≈0.586. The other is |-2 -1.414|=3.414. So minimum |z| is approximately 0.586 when x=0. But is this the minimal overall? Because maybe when x≠0, we can get a smaller |z|.

But first, let&#x27;s check if these points are indeed solutions. If x=0 and y = -3 +√2, then w =0 + (-3 +√2)i, so z = w +i = (-3 +√2)i +i = (-2 +√2)i. Then |z| = | -2 +√2 | ≈0.586. Similarly, the other root gives |z|=3.414. So perhaps 2 -√2 is approximately0.586, which is 2 -1.414≈0.586.

But the question is whether there are other solutions with x≠0 that have smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal |z| occurs on the y-axis (x=0). Let me check that.

If x=0, then z = (0) + (y +1)i. So |z| is |y +1|. The minimal |y +1| occurs at y = -1, which gives |z|=0. But does y=-1 satisfy the equation? Let&#x27;s check.

If x=0 and y=-1, then w = z -i = (0 + (-1)i) -i = -2i. Then check |(w +2i)^2 -3| = |(-2i +2i)^2 -3| = |0 -3| =3. And 2|w| =2*| -2i | =4. 3≠4, so y=-1 is not a solution.

Wait, but when x=0, we had solutions at y= -3 ±√2. The minimal |z| for x=0 is | -2 +√2 |≈0.586. Let&#x27;s see if we can find a solution with x≠0 that has a smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal occurs at another point. Let me consider that |z| is minimal when z is closest to the origin on the curve defined by |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Maybe this curve is a circle or some conic section.

Alternatively, notice that the original equation can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Let me consider squaring both sides:

|(z +i)^2 -3|² = 4|z -i|²

Which can be written as [(z +i)^2 -3][\overline{(z +i)^2 -3}] =4(z -i)(\overline{z -i})

But this might not help unless expanded. Let me try writing z = x + yi and expanding everything again.

Alternatively, maybe notice that (z +i)^2 -3 is a quadratic in z, so the equation represents some quadratic curve. The set of points z where |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i| is likely a circle or an ellipse or hyperbola.

Alternatively, think of this as |(z +i)^2 -3| / |z -i| =2. So the ratio of distances is 2, which resembles the definition of an Apollonius circle. However, typically, Apollonius circle is |z -a| / |z -b| =k, which is a circle. But here, the numerator is |(z +i)^2 -3|, which is not a linear function, so the locus is not a circle. So maybe it&#x27;s a quartic curve.

Given that, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs at one of the points we found on the y-axis. But to confirm, perhaps consider other points.

Alternatively, parameterize the problem with z = ti where t is real. Let me try z = ti, then |z| = |t|. Let&#x27;s check if this satisfies the equation.

z = ti, so z +i = ti +i = (t +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = -(t +1)^2. Then (z +i)^2 -3 = - (t +1)^2 -3. The modulus is | - (t +1)^2 -3 | = (t +1)^2 +3.

On the other side, 2|z -i| =2| ti -i | =2| (t -1)i | =2|t -1|

So the equation becomes (t +1)^2 +3 =2|t -1|

Let me solve this equation.

Case 1: t &gt;=1. Then |t -1|=t -1.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3 =2(t -1)

Expand left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2t -2

So t² +2t +4 =2t -2

t² +6=0. No real solutions.

Case 2: t &lt;1. Then |t -1|=1 -t.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3=2(1 -t)

Left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2 -2t

So t² +2t +4 =2 -2t

t² +4t +2 =0

Solutions: t = [-4 ±sqrt(16 -8)]/2 =[-4 ±sqrt(8)]/2 =[-4 ±2√2]/2= -2 ±√2

So t = -2 +√2≈-0.585 and t=-2 -√2≈-3.414

Check if these are less than1: yes, both are.

So z =ti, so |z| =|t|. So the |z| for these solutions are |-2 +√2|≈0.586 and |-2 -√2|≈3.414. So same as before. So when z is purely imaginary, the minimal |z| is 2 -√2≈0.5857.

But is this the minimal overall? Maybe there are other points not on the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

To check, let&#x27;s suppose that minimal |z| occurs at a point not on the y-axis, so x≠0. To verify, perhaps set y such that the derivative is zero, but given the complexity of the equation, this might be difficult.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal |z| is achieved when z is colinear with the origin and the center of some circle... Wait, but the problem is that the equation is not a circle.

Alternatively, use the triangle inequality. Let me see:

We have |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

Note that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= ||(z +i)^2| -|3|| by the reverse triangle inequality. But not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, expand (z +i)^2 -3:

(z +i)^2 -3 = z² +2i z -1 -3 =z² +2i z -4

So the equation is |z² +2i z -4| =2|z -i|

Hmm, still not helpful. Let me see:

If I let z =0, then |0 +0 -4|=4, and 2|0 -i|=2*1=2. So 4≠2, so z=0 is not a solution.

If z approaches 0, then |z² +2i z -4| ≈4, and 2|z -i|≈2*1=2, so LHS &gt;RHS near z=0. So the minimal |z| must be somewhere else.

Alternatively, consider parametrizing z in terms of |z|. Let me write z = r e^{iθ}, then |z|=r. Then we need to express the equation in terms of r and θ.

But this might be complicated. Let me attempt it.

Express z = r e^{iθ}. Then z +i = r e^{iθ} +i. Let me compute (z +i)^2:

(z +i)^2 = (r e^{iθ} +i)^2 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -1

Therefore, (z +i)^2 -3 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4

So modulus squared is |r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4|² = [r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2

And the right side is 2|z -i| =2| r e^{iθ} -i | =2 sqrt(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

So squaring both sides:

[r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2 =4(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

This equation relates r and θ. To find the minimal r, we can try to analyze this equation.

This looks very involved, but perhaps consider specific angles θ where the equation simplifies.

For instance, let me consider θ = -π/2, which would align z along the negative imaginary axis. Then z = -r i.

Compute left side:

[r² cos(-π) -4]^2 + [r² sin(-π) +2r cos(-π/2)]^2

= [r²*(-1) -4]^2 + [0 +2r*0]^2

= (-r² -4)^2 +0 = (r² +4)^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r*(-1))=4(r² +1 +2r)=4r² +4 +8r

Set equal:

(r² +4)^2 =4r² +8r +4

Expand left: r^4 +8r² +16

So equation: r^4 +8r² +16 =4r² +8r +4

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +4r² -8r +12=0

Not sure if this factors. Testing r=1:1 +4 -8 +12=9≠0

r=2:16 +16 -16 +12=28≠0

No obvious roots. So θ=-π/2 might not yield solutions.

Alternatively, take θ=0, so z is real positive. Then z =r.

Left side:

[r² cos0 -4]^2 +[r² sin0 +2r cos0]^2

= (r² -4)^2 + (0 +2r)^2 = (r² -4)^2 +4r²

Right side:

4(r² +1 -0)=4r² +4

Set equal:

(r² -4)^2 +4r² =4r² +4

Simplify: (r² -4)^2 =4

Take sqrt: r² -4=±2

Case1: r² -4=2 =&gt;r²=6 =&gt;r=√6≈2.449

Case2: r² -4=-2 =&gt;r²=2 =&gt;r=√2≈1.414

So θ=0, solutions at r=√2 and r=√6. So |z|=√2≈1.414 and √6≈2.449. But earlier, on the imaginary axis, we had |z|=2 -√2≈0.586, which is smaller. So these are not minimal.

Alternatively, check θ=π/2, z=ri, but already considered that case.

Alternatively, suppose θ=π/4. Then z = r e^{iπ/4}= r(√2/2 +i√2/2)

Compute left side:

[r² cos(π/2) -4]^2 + [r² sin(π/2) +2r cos(π/4)]^2

= [0 -4]^2 + [r²*1 +2r*(√2/2)]^2

=16 + [r² +√2 r]^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r sin(π/4))=4(r² +1 -2r*(√2/2))=4(r² +1 -√2 r)

Set equal:

16 + (r² +√2 r)^2 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Expand left:

16 +r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r²

Equation:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r² +16 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 -2r² +4√2 r +12=0

This seems difficult to solve. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis, as previously found. To confirm, maybe check another angle.

Alternatively, notice that when we substituted z =ti (i.e., x=0), we found solutions with |z|=2 -√2 and 2 +√2. The smaller one is 2 -√2≈0.5858.

But we need to check if there are any other solutions off the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

Suppose there exists a point z with |z| &lt;2 -√2. Let me assume such a point exists and see if it leads to a contradiction.

Let |z|=r &lt;2 -√2≈0.5858.

But since |z -i| &gt;= | |z| - |i| | = |r -1|. So 2|z -i| &gt;=2(1 -r)

On the other hand, |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= |(z +i)^2| +| -3| = |z +i|² +3. Since |z +i| &lt;=|z| +|i|=r +1. So |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

But we have equality |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So if 2(1 -r) &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

Let me check if this holds for r &lt;2 -√2.

Compute RHS - LHS = (r +1)^2 +3 -2(1 -r)=r² +2r +1 +3 -2 +2r=r² +4r +2

Which is positive for all real r. So this inequality holds for any r, but that doesn&#x27;t give us a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps using other inequalities. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= | |(z +i)^2| - |3| |. Which is | |z +i|² -3 |.

So we have | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;= |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;=2|z -i|

But not sure how helpful this is.

Alternatively, let me assume that the minimal |z| occurs at the point we found on the imaginary axis, 2 -√2≈0.586, and check if there can be any other points with smaller |z|.

Alternatively, note that the equation |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i| can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3|² =4|z -i|², which is the equation we derived earlier. If we assume that the minimal |z| occurs at a point where the gradient is colinear with the position vector, i.e., the point where the curve is tangent to the circle centered at the origin. But calculating this would require using Lagrange multipliers, which is quite involved given the complexity of the equation.

Alternatively, given the earlier solutions on the imaginary axis and given that when minimizing |z|, the closest point might lie on the imaginary axis due to symmetry. Since the equation involves z +i and z -i, which are vertical translations, it&#x27;s possible that the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal value we found is 2 -√2≈0.5858, and since we couldn&#x27;t find any solution with smaller |z|, and given the symmetry, this might be the minimal value.

Therefore, I think the minimal |z| is 2 -√2, achieved when z is on the imaginary axis at z=(-2 +√2)i, so |z|=| -2 +√2 | =2 -√2.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the minimum value of \(|z|\) for complex numbers \(z\) satisfying the equation \(|(z + i)^2 - 3| = 2|z - i|\), we start by substituting \(z = w + i\) where \(w = z - i\). This transforms the equation into \(|(w + 2i)^2 - 3| = 2|w|\).

We then consider \(w = x + yi\) and substitute into the equation. After expanding and simplifying both sides, we find that the equation becomes complex. However, by considering specific cases where \(w\) is purely imaginary (i.e., \(x = 0\)), we simplify the problem.

Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation, we solve for \(y\) and find the roots \(y = -3 \pm \sqrt{2}\). Translating back to \(z\), we get \(z = (-2 + \sqrt{2})i\) and \(z = (-2 - \sqrt{2})i\). The modulus \(|z|\) for these points is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} |\) and \(| -2 - \sqrt{2} |\), respectively.

The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} | = 2 - \sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. The question is asking for the minimum value of |z| where z is a complex number that satisfies the equation |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Hmm, complex numbers and modulus... I remember that complex numbers can be represented in the complex plane, so maybe I can translate this equation into geometric terms?

First, let me recall that for a complex number z = x + yi, |z| is the modulus, which is √(x² + y²). So |z| represents the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) in the plane. The problem wants the minimum such distance among all z that satisfy the given equation.

The equation given is |(z + i)² - 3| = 2|z - i|. Let me try to break this down. Let&#x27;s substitute z = x + yi into the equation. Then z + i = x + (y + 1)i. Squaring that gives (x + (y + 1)i)². Let me compute that:

(x + (y + 1)i)² = x² + 2x(y + 1)i + [(y + 1)i]²
= x² + 2x(y + 1)i - (y + 1)²
= (x² - (y + 1)²) + 2x(y + 1)i

So (z + i)² - 3 would be [(x² - (y + 1)²) - 3] + 2x(y + 1)i. Then the modulus of this is equal to 2|z - i|. Let&#x27;s compute both sides.

Left side modulus: sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side: 2|z - i| = 2| x + (y - 1)i | = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

So, the equation becomes:

sqrt[(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²] = 2 sqrt(x² + (y - 1)²)

Hmm, that looks complicated. Maybe squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots would help. Let me try that.

Left side squared: [(x² - (y + 1)² - 3)² + (2x(y + 1))²]

Right side squared: 4(x² + (y - 1)²)

So expanding the left side:

First, let me denote A = x² - (y + 1)² - 3, and B = 2x(y + 1). Then the left side squared is A² + B².

Compute A²:

[x² - (y + 1)² - 3]^2

Let me expand (y + 1)² first: y² + 2y + 1. So x² - (y² + 2y + 1) - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 1 - 3 = x² - y² - 2y - 4.

Therefore, A = x² - y² - 2y - 4, so A² = (x² - y² - 2y - 4)²

Similarly, B = 2x(y + 1), so B² = 4x²(y + 1)²

So left side squared becomes:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4(x² + (y - 1)^2)

Let me expand the right side:

4(x² + y² - 2y + 1) = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

So now, the equation is:

(x² - y² - 2y - 4)^2 + 4x²(y + 1)^2 = 4x² + 4y² - 8y + 4

Hmm, this seems really messy. Maybe there&#x27;s a better way to approach this problem instead of expanding everything. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let w = z - i. Then z = w + i. Let me substitute that into the original equation.

So, |(w + i + i)² - 3| = 2|w + i - i| =&gt; |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)² - 3| = 2|w|

Maybe this substitution simplifies things. Let&#x27;s denote w = a + bi. Then w + 2i = a + (b + 2)i. Then (w + 2i)² is [a + (b + 2)i]² = a² + 2a(b + 2)i + [(b + 2)i]^2 = a² + 2a(b + 2)i - (b + 2)^2

So (w + 2i)^2 - 3 = [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3] + 2a(b + 2)i

Then the modulus squared is [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4|w|^2 = 4(a² + b²)

So expanding the left side:

[a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2 + [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4(a² + b²)

Let me compute [a² - (b + 2)^2 - 3]^2. First, expand (b + 2)^2: b² + 4b + 4. So a² - b² -4b -4 -3 = a² - b² -4b -7. So the first term is (a² - b² -4b -7)^2.

Second term: [2a(b + 2)]^2 = 4a²(b + 2)^2

So left side becomes:

(a² - b² -4b -7)^2 + 4a²(b + 2)^2 = 4a² + 4b²

This still seems complicated, but maybe expanding the left side will lead to some cancellation.

First, let&#x27;s expand (a² - b² -4b -7)^2:

= (a²)^2 + (-b² -4b -7)^2 + 2a²(-b² -4b -7)

= a^4 + (b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b² + 56b) + (-2a²b² -8a²b -14a²)

Wait, that&#x27;s a bit messy. Let me do it step by step.

Let me denote C = a² and D = -b² -4b -7. Then (C + D)^2 = C² + 2CD + D².

C² = (a²)^2 = a^4

2CD = 2a²(-b² -4b -7) = -2a²b² -8a²b -14a²

D² = (-b² -4b -7)^2. Let&#x27;s compute that:

= (b² +4b +7)^2

= (b²)^2 + (4b)^2 + (7)^2 + 2*b²*4b + 2*b²*7 + 2*4b*7

= b^4 + 16b^2 + 49 + 8b^3 + 14b^2 + 56b

= b^4 + 8b^3 + (16b^2 +14b^2) +56b +49

= b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So D² = b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

So putting it all together, (a² - b² -4b -7)^2 = a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, adding the second term: 4a²(b + 2)^2

First compute (b + 2)^2 = b² +4b +4. Then 4a²*(b² +4b +4) = 4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

So the entire left side becomes:

a^4 -2a²b² -8a²b -14a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 +4a²b² +16a²b +16a²

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

a^4: a^4

a²b² terms: -2a²b² +4a²b² = 2a²b²

a²b terms: -8a²b +16a²b = 8a²b

a² terms: -14a² +16a² = 2a²

b^4: b^4

b^3:8b^3

b^2:30b^2

b terms:56b

constants:49

So left side simplifies to:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49

Now, the right side is 4a² +4b²

Therefore, the equation is:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 = 4a² +4b²

Bringing all terms to the left side:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b +2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +30b^2 +56b +49 -4a² -4b² =0

Simplify:

a^4 + 2a²b² +8a²b + (2a² -4a²) + b^4 +8b^3 + (30b^2 -4b^2) +56b +49 =0

Which simplifies to:

a^4 +2a²b² +8a²b -2a² + b^4 +8b^3 +26b^2 +56b +49=0

Hmm, this still looks quite complicated. Maybe there&#x27;s a different approach here. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z - i|

Perhaps instead of substituting z = x + yi, I can interpret this geometrically. Let me recall that for complex numbers, |A - B| represents the distance between points A and B in the complex plane.

But here, the equation is |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Hmm, that&#x27;s not a straightforward distance. Alternatively, maybe I can see (z + i)^2 as some transformation of z. Squaring a complex number can be seen as a geometric transformation: squaring the modulus and doubling the angle. But I&#x27;m not sure how that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe set w = z + i, so z = w - i. Then the equation becomes |w² - 3| = 2|w - 2i|

But maybe this substitution can help. Let me check:

Original substitution: z = w - i, so z + i = w, and z - i = w - 2i. Then the equation |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

So we have |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Maybe this is easier to handle. Let me denote w = a + bi. Then w² = (a + bi)^2 = a² - b² + 2abi. Then w² - 3 = (a² - b² -3) + 2abi. The modulus of this is sqrt[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] and the right side is 2*sqrt[a² + (b - 2)^2]. Then squaring both sides:

[(a² - b² -3)^2 + (2ab)^2] = 4[a² + (b -2)^2]

But this seems similar to the previous approach. Maybe expanding this will lead to the same equation.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a parametrization or polar coordinates. Let me try that. Let me set w = r e^{iθ}, where r = |w|, θ is the argument.

Then |w² -3| = 2|w - 2i|

Expressing in polar coordinates:

|r² e^{i2θ} -3| = 2 | r e^{iθ} - 2i|

But this might not lead to an easy equation either. Let me compute both sides.

Left side modulus: |r² e^{i2θ} -3|. This is the distance from the point (r² cos 2θ, r² sin 2θ) to (3, 0).

Right side: 2|r e^{iθ} - 2i| = 2| (r cos θ) + i(r sin θ - 2)| = 2 sqrt[ (r cos θ)^2 + (r sin θ -2)^2 ]

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps consider specific points. For example, if z is real, then z = x, so y =0. Then compute if that satisfies the equation.

But maybe that&#x27;s too restrictive. The minimum |z| might not occur on the real axis. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus. Let me consider that |z| is the distance from the origin, and we need to minimize this distance subject to the constraint |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. So this is an optimization problem with a constraint. Maybe Lagrange multipliers?

Yes, that&#x27;s a possible approach. Let me try that.

Let me denote z = x + yi. Then |z| = sqrt(x² + y²). We need to minimize x² + y² (since sqrt is increasing, minimizing sqrt(x² + y²) is equivalent to minimizing x² + y²).

The constraint is |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0. Let me denote f(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

So using Lagrange multipliers, the gradients of the objective function and the constraint should be proportional.

The objective function is F(x, y) = x² + y².

The constraint is G(x, y) = |(z + i)^2 -3| -2|z -i| =0.

Compute ∇F = [2x, 2y]

Compute ∇G. This is a bit involved, but let&#x27;s recall that for a function G(x,y) = |A(x, y)| - |B(x, y)|, the gradient is (∇|A| - ∇|B|). So need to compute gradients of |(z +i)^2 -3| and 2|z -i|.

Let me first compute |(z +i)^2 -3|.

Let me denote A = (z +i)^2 -3. Then |A| is modulus of A.

Express A in terms of x and y. As earlier, z = x + yi, so z +i = x + (y +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = x² - (y +1)^2 + 2x(y +1)i. Then subtract 3: [x² - (y +1)^2 -3] + 2x(y +1)i. So A = u + vi where u = x² - (y +1)^2 -3 and v = 2x(y +1).

Thus, |A| = sqrt(u² + v²). The gradient of |A| is ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) )

Similarly, |B| where B = z -i = x + (y -1)i, so |B| = sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2). The gradient of |B| is (x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2), (y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2))

Therefore, gradient of G = ( (du/dx * u + dv/dx * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*(x / sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)), (du/dy * u + dv/dy * v)/sqrt(u² + v²) - 2*((y -1)/ sqrt(x² + (y -1)^2)) )

This seems very complicated, but maybe at the minimal point, there is some symmetry or simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps parameterizing the problem. Let me think again.

Original equation: |(z + i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|

Let me let z -i = w. Then z = w + i. Then z + i = w + 2i. So the equation becomes |(w + 2i)^2 -3| = 2|w|

So |w² +4i w -4 -3| =2|w|, since (w + 2i)^2 = w² +4i w + (2i)^2 = w² +4i w -4. Then subtract 3: w² +4i w -7.

Thus, |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|

Hmm, maybe if I write this as |w² +4i w -7| =2|w|, perhaps dividing both sides by |w| (assuming w ≠0):

| w +4i -7/w | =2

But not sure if this helps. Let me check:

If w ≠0, then divide both sides by |w|:

| (w² +4i w -7)/w | =2 =&gt; |w +4i -7/w| =2

But this might not necessarily help. Alternatively, set t = w, then |t² +4i t -7| =2|t|. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |t² +4i t -7|² =4|t|²

So (t² +4i t -7)(\overline{t² +4i t -7}) =4|t|²

But this is getting too algebraic. Let me try to write t as x + yi.

Let t = x + yi. Then t² = (x + yi)^2 = x² - y² + 2xyi

4i t =4i(x + yi) = -4y +4x i

So t² +4i t -7 = (x² - y² -4y -7) + (2xy +4x)i

Thus, modulus squared is (x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4(x² + y²)

So equation:

(x² - y² -4y -7)^2 + (2xy +4x)^2 =4x² +4y²

Wait, this is the same equation I had earlier when substituting w = t = z -i. So seems like we end up at the same quartic equation. Maybe expanding is the way to go.

Let me try expanding the left side:

First term: (x² - y² -4y -7)^2

Let me expand this:

= (x²)^2 + (-y² -4y -7)^2 + 2x²*(-y² -4y -7)

= x^4 + (y^4 +16y² +49 +8y^3 +14y² +56y) + (-2x²y² -8x²y -14x²)

Wait, similar to before:

Wait, (-y² -4y -7)^2 = (y² +4y +7)^2 = y^4 +8y^3 + (16y² +14y²) +56y +49 = y^4 +8y^3 +30y^2 +56y +49

And the cross term is 2x²*(-y² -4y -7) = -2x²y² -8x²y -14x²

Second term: (2xy +4x)^2 =4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

So left side total:

x^4 + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -2x²y² -8x²y -14x² +4x²y² +16x²y +16x²

Combine like terms:

x^4 + [y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49] + [(-2x²y² +4x²y²) + (-8x²y +16x²y) + (-14x² +16x²)]

Simplify each group:

x^4 remains.

y terms: y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

x²y² terms: (-2 +4)x²y² =2x²y²

x²y terms: (-8 +16)x²y =8x²y

x² terms: (-14 +16)x² =2x²

So left side becomes:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49

Set equal to right side 4x² +4y²:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 =4x² +4y²

Bring all terms to left side:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y +2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +30y² +56y +49 -4x² -4y²=0

Simplify:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y + (2x² -4x²) + y^4 +8y^3 + (30y² -4y²) +56y +49=0

Which simplifies to:

x^4 +2x²y² +8x²y -2x² + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

This equation is still very complicated. Maybe factorizing or looking for possible substitutions.

Alternatively, maybe trying specific values. For example, suppose x =0. Then the equation becomes:

0 +0 +0 -0 + y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0

Which is y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49=0. Let me check if this has real roots. Hmm, possible rational roots are ±1,±7,±49. Testing y = -1:

1 -8 +26 -56 +49 =12 ≠0

y=-7: (-7)^4 +8*(-7)^3 +26*(-7)^2 +56*(-7) +49=2401 -2744 +1274 -392 +49= 2401 -2744= -343; -343 +1274=931; 931 -392=539; 539 +49=588≠0

Not zero. Maybe it factors into quadratics?

Suppose y^4 +8y^3 +26y² +56y +49 = (y² + a y + b)(y² +c y +d)

Multiply out:

y^4 + (a +c)y³ + (ac +b +d)y² + (ad + bc)y + bd

Set coefficients:

a +c=8

ac +b +d=26

ad + bc=56

bd=49

Since bd=49, possible pairs (b,d)=(7,7), (49,1), (-7,-7), etc. Let&#x27;s try positive integers first. 7 and7. Then b=7, d=7.

Then a +c=8

ac +7 +7=26 =&gt; ac=12

ad + bc=56 =&gt;7a +7c=56 =&gt;a +c=8. Which matches the first equation. So from a +c=8 and ac=12. Solving:

a and c are roots of t² -8t +12=0. Which factors as (t -6)(t -2)=0. So a=6, c=2 or a=2, c=6.

Check ad + bc: if a=6, c=2, then 7*6 +7*2=42 +14=56. Yes, works. Similarly if a=2, c=6: 7*2 +7*6=14 +42=56. So works.

Therefore, the quartic factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0

So setting x=0, the equation factors as (y² +6y +7)(y² +2y +7)=0. The roots would be y = [-6 ±sqrt(36 -28)]/2 = [-6 ±sqrt(8)]/2 = [-6 ±2√2]/2 = -3 ±√2. Similarly for the other quadratic: y = [-2 ±sqrt(4 -28)]/2. But sqrt(-24) is imaginary. So real roots are y = -3 +√2 and y = -3 -√2. But since x=0, then z =0 + yi -i = y -i. Wait, no. Wait, we set t = z -i =w, then x and y are coordinates of w. So z = w +i. If w has x=0, then z =0 + (y +1)i. So |z| = sqrt(0 + (y +1)^2) = |y +1|. The real roots for y are -3 ±√2. So |z| would be | (-3 ±√2 ) +1 | = | -2 ±√2 |. So |-2 +√2| and |-2 -√2|. Since √2≈1.414, so -2 +1.414≈-0.586, absolute value≈0.586. The other is |-2 -1.414|=3.414. So minimum |z| is approximately 0.586 when x=0. But is this the minimal overall? Because maybe when x≠0, we can get a smaller |z|.

But first, let&#x27;s check if these points are indeed solutions. If x=0 and y = -3 +√2, then w =0 + (-3 +√2)i, so z = w +i = (-3 +√2)i +i = (-2 +√2)i. Then |z| = | -2 +√2 | ≈0.586. Similarly, the other root gives |z|=3.414. So perhaps 2 -√2 is approximately0.586, which is 2 -1.414≈0.586.

But the question is whether there are other solutions with x≠0 that have smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal |z| occurs on the y-axis (x=0). Let me check that.

If x=0, then z = (0) + (y +1)i. So |z| is |y +1|. The minimal |y +1| occurs at y = -1, which gives |z|=0. But does y=-1 satisfy the equation? Let&#x27;s check.

If x=0 and y=-1, then w = z -i = (0 + (-1)i) -i = -2i. Then check |(w +2i)^2 -3| = |(-2i +2i)^2 -3| = |0 -3| =3. And 2|w| =2*| -2i | =4. 3≠4, so y=-1 is not a solution.

Wait, but when x=0, we had solutions at y= -3 ±√2. The minimal |z| for x=0 is | -2 +√2 |≈0.586. Let&#x27;s see if we can find a solution with x≠0 that has a smaller |z|.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal occurs at another point. Let me consider that |z| is minimal when z is closest to the origin on the curve defined by |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Maybe this curve is a circle or some conic section.

Alternatively, notice that the original equation can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i|. Let me consider squaring both sides:

|(z +i)^2 -3|² = 4|z -i|²

Which can be written as [(z +i)^2 -3][\overline{(z +i)^2 -3}] =4(z -i)(\overline{z -i})

But this might not help unless expanded. Let me try writing z = x + yi and expanding everything again.

Alternatively, maybe notice that (z +i)^2 -3 is a quadratic in z, so the equation represents some quadratic curve. The set of points z where |(z +i)^2 -3| = 2|z -i| is likely a circle or an ellipse or hyperbola.

Alternatively, think of this as |(z +i)^2 -3| / |z -i| =2. So the ratio of distances is 2, which resembles the definition of an Apollonius circle. However, typically, Apollonius circle is |z -a| / |z -b| =k, which is a circle. But here, the numerator is |(z +i)^2 -3|, which is not a linear function, so the locus is not a circle. So maybe it&#x27;s a quartic curve.

Given that, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs at one of the points we found on the y-axis. But to confirm, perhaps consider other points.

Alternatively, parameterize the problem with z = ti where t is real. Let me try z = ti, then |z| = |t|. Let&#x27;s check if this satisfies the equation.

z = ti, so z +i = ti +i = (t +1)i. Then (z +i)^2 = -(t +1)^2. Then (z +i)^2 -3 = - (t +1)^2 -3. The modulus is | - (t +1)^2 -3 | = (t +1)^2 +3.

On the other side, 2|z -i| =2| ti -i | =2| (t -1)i | =2|t -1|

So the equation becomes (t +1)^2 +3 =2|t -1|

Let me solve this equation.

Case 1: t &gt;=1. Then |t -1|=t -1.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3 =2(t -1)

Expand left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2t -2

So t² +2t +4 =2t -2

t² +6=0. No real solutions.

Case 2: t &lt;1. Then |t -1|=1 -t.

Equation: (t +1)^2 +3=2(1 -t)

Left: t² +2t +1 +3 =t² +2t +4

Right:2 -2t

So t² +2t +4 =2 -2t

t² +4t +2 =0

Solutions: t = [-4 ±sqrt(16 -8)]/2 =[-4 ±sqrt(8)]/2 =[-4 ±2√2]/2= -2 ±√2

So t = -2 +√2≈-0.585 and t=-2 -√2≈-3.414

Check if these are less than1: yes, both are.

So z =ti, so |z| =|t|. So the |z| for these solutions are |-2 +√2|≈0.586 and |-2 -√2|≈3.414. So same as before. So when z is purely imaginary, the minimal |z| is 2 -√2≈0.5857.

But is this the minimal overall? Maybe there are other points not on the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

To check, let&#x27;s suppose that minimal |z| occurs at a point not on the y-axis, so x≠0. To verify, perhaps set y such that the derivative is zero, but given the complexity of the equation, this might be difficult.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal |z| is achieved when z is colinear with the origin and the center of some circle... Wait, but the problem is that the equation is not a circle.

Alternatively, use the triangle inequality. Let me see:

We have |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

Note that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= ||(z +i)^2| -|3|| by the reverse triangle inequality. But not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, expand (z +i)^2 -3:

(z +i)^2 -3 = z² +2i z -1 -3 =z² +2i z -4

So the equation is |z² +2i z -4| =2|z -i|

Hmm, still not helpful. Let me see:

If I let z =0, then |0 +0 -4|=4, and 2|0 -i|=2*1=2. So 4≠2, so z=0 is not a solution.

If z approaches 0, then |z² +2i z -4| ≈4, and 2|z -i|≈2*1=2, so LHS &gt;RHS near z=0. So the minimal |z| must be somewhere else.

Alternatively, consider parametrizing z in terms of |z|. Let me write z = r e^{iθ}, then |z|=r. Then we need to express the equation in terms of r and θ.

But this might be complicated. Let me attempt it.

Express z = r e^{iθ}. Then z +i = r e^{iθ} +i. Let me compute (z +i)^2:

(z +i)^2 = (r e^{iθ} +i)^2 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -1

Therefore, (z +i)^2 -3 = r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4

So modulus squared is |r² e^{i2θ} +2i r e^{iθ} -4|² = [r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2

And the right side is 2|z -i| =2| r e^{iθ} -i | =2 sqrt(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

So squaring both sides:

[r² cos2θ -4]^2 + [r² sin2θ +2r cosθ]^2 =4(r² +1 -2r sinθ)

This equation relates r and θ. To find the minimal r, we can try to analyze this equation.

This looks very involved, but perhaps consider specific angles θ where the equation simplifies.

For instance, let me consider θ = -π/2, which would align z along the negative imaginary axis. Then z = -r i.

Compute left side:

[r² cos(-π) -4]^2 + [r² sin(-π) +2r cos(-π/2)]^2

= [r²*(-1) -4]^2 + [0 +2r*0]^2

= (-r² -4)^2 +0 = (r² +4)^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r*(-1))=4(r² +1 +2r)=4r² +4 +8r

Set equal:

(r² +4)^2 =4r² +8r +4

Expand left: r^4 +8r² +16

So equation: r^4 +8r² +16 =4r² +8r +4

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +4r² -8r +12=0

Not sure if this factors. Testing r=1:1 +4 -8 +12=9≠0

r=2:16 +16 -16 +12=28≠0

No obvious roots. So θ=-π/2 might not yield solutions.

Alternatively, take θ=0, so z is real positive. Then z =r.

Left side:

[r² cos0 -4]^2 +[r² sin0 +2r cos0]^2

= (r² -4)^2 + (0 +2r)^2 = (r² -4)^2 +4r²

Right side:

4(r² +1 -0)=4r² +4

Set equal:

(r² -4)^2 +4r² =4r² +4

Simplify: (r² -4)^2 =4

Take sqrt: r² -4=±2

Case1: r² -4=2 =&gt;r²=6 =&gt;r=√6≈2.449

Case2: r² -4=-2 =&gt;r²=2 =&gt;r=√2≈1.414

So θ=0, solutions at r=√2 and r=√6. So |z|=√2≈1.414 and √6≈2.449. But earlier, on the imaginary axis, we had |z|=2 -√2≈0.586, which is smaller. So these are not minimal.

Alternatively, check θ=π/2, z=ri, but already considered that case.

Alternatively, suppose θ=π/4. Then z = r e^{iπ/4}= r(√2/2 +i√2/2)

Compute left side:

[r² cos(π/2) -4]^2 + [r² sin(π/2) +2r cos(π/4)]^2

= [0 -4]^2 + [r²*1 +2r*(√2/2)]^2

=16 + [r² +√2 r]^2

Right side:

4(r² +1 -2r sin(π/4))=4(r² +1 -2r*(√2/2))=4(r² +1 -√2 r)

Set equal:

16 + (r² +√2 r)^2 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Expand left:

16 +r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r²

Equation:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 +2r² +16 =4r² +4 -4√2 r

Bring all terms left:

r^4 +2√2 r^3 -2r² +4√2 r +12=0

This seems difficult to solve. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis, as previously found. To confirm, maybe check another angle.

Alternatively, notice that when we substituted z =ti (i.e., x=0), we found solutions with |z|=2 -√2 and 2 +√2. The smaller one is 2 -√2≈0.5858.

But we need to check if there are any other solutions off the imaginary axis with smaller |z|.

Suppose there exists a point z with |z| &lt;2 -√2. Let me assume such a point exists and see if it leads to a contradiction.

Let |z|=r &lt;2 -√2≈0.5858.

But since |z -i| &gt;= | |z| - |i| | = |r -1|. So 2|z -i| &gt;=2(1 -r)

On the other hand, |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= |(z +i)^2| +| -3| = |z +i|² +3. Since |z +i| &lt;=|z| +|i|=r +1. So |(z +i)^2 -3| &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

But we have equality |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So if 2(1 -r) &lt;= (r +1)^2 +3.

Let me check if this holds for r &lt;2 -√2.

Compute RHS - LHS = (r +1)^2 +3 -2(1 -r)=r² +2r +1 +3 -2 +2r=r² +4r +2

Which is positive for all real r. So this inequality holds for any r, but that doesn&#x27;t give us a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps using other inequalities. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe consider that |(z +i)^2 -3| &gt;= | |(z +i)^2| - |3| |. Which is | |z +i|² -3 |.

So we have | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;= |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i|

So | |z +i|² -3 | &lt;=2|z -i|

But not sure how helpful this is.

Alternatively, let me assume that the minimal |z| occurs at the point we found on the imaginary axis, 2 -√2≈0.586, and check if there can be any other points with smaller |z|.

Alternatively, note that the equation |(z +i)^2 -3| =2|z -i| can be written as |(z +i)^2 -3|² =4|z -i|², which is the equation we derived earlier. If we assume that the minimal |z| occurs at a point where the gradient is colinear with the position vector, i.e., the point where the curve is tangent to the circle centered at the origin. But calculating this would require using Lagrange multipliers, which is quite involved given the complexity of the equation.

Alternatively, given the earlier solutions on the imaginary axis and given that when minimizing |z|, the closest point might lie on the imaginary axis due to symmetry. Since the equation involves z +i and z -i, which are vertical translations, it&#x27;s possible that the minimal |z| occurs on the imaginary axis.

Alternatively, consider that the minimal value we found is 2 -√2≈0.5858, and since we couldn&#x27;t find any solution with smaller |z|, and given the symmetry, this might be the minimal value.

Therefore, I think the minimal |z| is 2 -√2, achieved when z is on the imaginary axis at z=(-2 +√2)i, so |z|=| -2 +√2 | =2 -√2.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the minimum value of \(|z|\) for complex numbers \(z\) satisfying the equation \(|(z + i)^2 - 3| = 2|z - i|\), we start by substituting \(z = w + i\) where \(w = z - i\). This transforms the equation into \(|(w + 2i)^2 - 3| = 2|w|\).

We then consider \(w = x + yi\) and substitute into the equation. After expanding and simplifying both sides, we find that the equation becomes complex. However, by considering specific cases where \(w\) is purely imaginary (i.e., \(x = 0\)), we simplify the problem.

Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation, we solve for \(y\) and find the roots \(y = -3 \pm \sqrt{2}\). Translating back to \(z\), we get \(z = (-2 + \sqrt{2})i\) and \(z = (-2 - \sqrt{2})i\). The modulus \(|z|\) for these points is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} |\) and \(| -2 - \sqrt{2} |\), respectively.

The minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(| -2 + \sqrt{2} | = 2 - \sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the minimum value of \(|z|\) is \(\boxed{2 - \sqrt{2}}\).          </p>
