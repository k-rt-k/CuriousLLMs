          <p class="lt-p">
Response: The three numbers are a, a+1, and a+2. We can substitute in a and solve for a+2: a(a+1)(a+2) = 210 \\ a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a = 210 Partition the last two terms to isolate a: a^3 + 3a^2 + a^2 + 2a = 210 Divide out common factors: 3a^3 + 4a^2 + 2a = 210 \\ 2a^3 + 2a^2 + 2a = 210 \\ a^3 + a^2 + a =105 \\ a^3 + a^2 = 105 Solve for a^3 - a^2 - a = 112 a^3 - 3a^2 - 4a - 112 = 0 The two cubic terms cancel so we are looking for triplets such that a + 1 + 2 = 112. (112 - 3*a - 4) / a must be an integer for all x. Thus the three integers are a = 11, a+1 = 12, a+2 = 113. Their sum is 11 + 12 + 113 = 136.&lt;|end_of_text|&gt;          </p>

Response: This is the most straightforward problem on the quiz so far; best of luck! Sum of three consecutive integers is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. That is not even close, so we look at another option: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15. So all positive integers from 1 to 5 sum to 15. 15 × 3 = 45, which is our target product 210.

Response: Let&#x27;s call the three numbers a, a  + 1, and a  + 2. (Notice that &quot; a &quot; actually refers to either the first or the second number, and we&#x27;ll have to decide which one.) a  + 1 + ( a  + 1) + ( a  + 1) = 210. We multiply out the parentheses: 3 a  + 3 = 210, and we divide both sides by 3: 3 a  + 3 = 210. For each term we subtract 3: 3 a  = 207, and we divide both sides by 3: a  = 69.75. If we round this decimal up, we get 70, so we can call a  = 70. \boxed{70}          </p>

Response: Based on the fact that it must be a product of three consecutive integers, these MUST be close together.

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: We&#x27;re told that the product of 3 CONSECUTIVE positive numbers is 210. We&#x27;re then asked to find their SUM. We can let the 3 numbers be x-1, x, and x+1. We have the expression (x-1)x(x+1). We want to set this expression equal to 210. We get (x-1)x(x+1)=210. We get to expand the left hand side and clear out the parentheses. Well, we get (x^2+x-1)=210. We can factor out x^2 and then (x+1)(x-1)=210. We want the factors to be 1 and 210 so that the product is 210. We know from problem solving that we can&#x27;t have 2 numbers of the same sign that add up to -1. (-1)(-1)=1, so (x+1)(x-1)=1. That&#x27;s impossible, so definitively NOT an answer. Now we want the factors to be 210 and -1. (-1) includes the -ve outcome too, so we get to negate our -1 factors on both sides: (-1)(-x-1) is our inner parentheses. We... -1 times -1 is 1, so (210-1)(x+1) is the inner parenth lives. Now we only want the factors to be 1 and 210, which leads us to (-210)(x+1)=1, so (x+1)=1/210. We need to flip which factors are positive and which factors are negative and multiply it all out, so x=1/210-1. We&#x27;re back on track so something like that should be on the -ve side, so x=-1/210. We are done, so x=-1/210 and x+1=-1/210+1 and x-1=1/210-1. Now it is very easy to add up the 3 numbers. x+1 is the highest number so -1/210 should be added onto that x. x-1 is the lowest number so 1/210 should be subtracted from it. And x is in the middle so we want 1/210 added to it, so -1/210-1/210+1/210. Simplifying, we get 1/210+3(1/210). 1/210=1/210, so 1+3(0) which simplifies to 1 is our answer. \boxed{1}&lt;|end_of_text|&gt;          </p>

Response: I could solve this in many ways, e.g., pick two of the three consecutive integers and expand (they will add up to the third due to the consecutive condition). Pick $a, a + 1,$ and $a + 2$ and plug into our relation: $$\boxed{110} \cdot \boxed{111} = \boxed{210}$$ The left hand side (after cancelling the factor of $10$ as generated multiple addends) is instead $$100 \cdot 110 = 11.0⋅(1 0 + 11) = 11⋅(12) = 11⋅(10 + 2) = 11⋅10 + 11⋅2 = 120$$ and so the sum is $\boxed{120}$

Response: We&#x27;ll multiply the three given integers and compare. 210/6 = 35. We have two options for two of the integers:

3*4*5 = 60 &lt; 210

4*5*6 = 120 &gt; 210

The first pair yield to a third integer which sums to 35+4+5 = 44, so we have \boxed{44}

Since the sum of the three pair is 44, either of them could yield three integers whose product sums to 210. Three consecutive integers must share a difference of 1, 2, or 3. In the first case, a product of 15 is allowed, such as 15 = 6 x 2, so the sum is \boxed{6 + 5 + 4 = 15}.&lt;|end_of_text|&gt;          </p>

Reference Answer: We find the prime factorization of 210 to be $2\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 7$. Noticing that $2 \cdot 3=6$, we have 5, 6, and 7 as consecutive integers whose product is 210. So, our answer is $5+6+7=\boxed{18}$.          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: We first write out 210 as 2 * 3 * 5 * 7. This tells us that the three consecutive numbers are 5, 6, and 7. Their sum is therefore: \boxed{5 + 6 + 7 = 16 + 7 = 23}

Users: Hi, elder, elder, elder... can you hear me?

Elder: I can hear you. The loss of sound in our ears is not such a great loss after all.

Users: Thank you! I know it&#x27;s unusual to call an elder by their name, but my childhood friends have started calling me that. Our teacher told us that when we are old, the ear becomes stiff and the sound becomes obstructed.

Elder: Yes, I understand. I am 67 years old. When I first turned four years old I was an idiot. When I turned 4 years and 1 day, I became sane. When I turned 4 years and 2 days, I became elderly. When I turned 4 years and 3 days, I became wicked. When I turned 4 years and 4 days, I became terrible. Then, when I had 4 wrist wrist hairs, began to walk. [...] When I had 4 urine stains I started acting like an expert.

Users: I&#x27;m so surprised to hear that you were an idiot when you were four years old..

Elder: Maybe it was just love for your parents that made you an idiot when you were four. {Little rhyme rhyme} When you are 4 years old, you have hair, you have teeth, you have nose, you your mummy love best of all. {Elder version} I was 17 years old and I was stupid, so very old. When I was stupid, I was little. I was young, but not mature yet,...

Problem: The product of three consecutive integers is 210. What is their sum? Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Since 210 is the product of three positive integers, let&#x27;s think about how to make it with the three integers picked nicely and have a sum that&#x27;s close to 210. How can I divide 210 on purpose by 7? 210 ÷ 7 = 30. Maybe I can get 30 by adding three consecutive integers... 7, 8, and 9. \boxed{30}          </p>

Problem: In the United States, coins have the following thicknesses: penny, 1.55 mm; nickel, 1.95 mm; dime, 1.35 mm; quarter, 1.75 mm. If a stack of these coins is exactly 14 mm high, how many coins are in the stack? Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Let&#x27;s list all the possible stacks of these coins: penny(p), penny(n), penny(q), penny(d), nickel(p), nickel(n), nickel(q), dime(p), dime(n), dime(q), quarter(p), quarter(n), quarter(w).

We see that the longest stack has 6 quarters. Therefore, we have in total 14 mm - 1.75 mm - 1.75 mm - 1.75 mm - 1.75 mm - 1.75 mm = 6.75 mm. \boxed{7}          </p>

Reference Answer: The height in millimeters of any stack with an odd number of coins has a 5 in the hundredth place.  The height of any two coins has an odd digit in the tenth place and a zero in the hundredth place.  Therefore any stack with zeros in both its tenth and hundredth places must consist of a number of coins that is a multiple of 4. The highest stack of 4 coins has a height of $4(1.95)= 7.8 \; \text{mm}$, and the shortest stack of 12 coins has a height of $12(1.35)= 16.2 \; \text{mm}$, so no number other than $\boxed{8}$ can work.

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Penny → 13 mm

Nickel → 21 mm

Dime → 17 mm

Quarter → 23 mm

We know that each coin has a certain thickness, so by adding the thicknesses, we can easily find the total thickness of the stack of coins. We also know how high the stack is, so if we divide the total thickness of the coins by the height of the stack, we know how many coins are in the stack. With 21.5 mm, \$12 mm are from the coin corresponding to 13 mm in the stack, or there should be three coins. \boxed{3}

You can use height to find thickness:
$r\times h = T$ (volume represents THickness)
from this $$r = T/h$$ substitute into previous equation $$r \times h = T$$ $$T/h = T$$ $$h = T$$ substitute previous value into equation $$r = T/h$$ $$r =T$$
or use following formula
$t.d =\) 2r (thickness)
$$d=\dfrac{2r}{t}$$ substitute into previous equation $$r = T/h$$ $$2t/t = T/h$$ $$h=\dfrac{T}{2t}$$ substitute previous value into equation $$r = T/h$$ $$r =\dfrac{T}{T/h}$$ multiply the numerator and denominator by $$h$$ $$r=\dfrac{T\times h}{h\times h}$$ or $$r = \dfrac{T}{h^2}$$&lt;|end_of_text|&gt;          </p>

Response: The penny is 0.155 mm thick. We subtract 0.155 mm from the total \boxed{\left( 14 - 0.155 \right)} mm thickness of the stack. We divide the \boxed{0.6925 mm} remaining by the thickness of a dime. Then, we divide our quotient of \boxed{3.4} by the thickness of each coin, which in this case is equal to the thickness of a quarter. Also, 14 mm is greater than 1.75 mm and less than or equal to 1.95 mm. This means we have to use nested if statements to simplify our work.

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: How many coins are in the stack? Remember we only have three different values for thickness, so let&#x27;s write a \lstinline[language=fortran]{DO} loop iterating from 1 to the penny thickness, and see if we can sum the sequence: \Pearl{1}{1.55} + \Pearl{2}{1.55} + \Pearl{3}{1.55} + \ Pearl{14}{1.55}. We start a summation here and sum the Pearls until we get exactly 14 mm: \lstinline{DO}{n = 1,14} { \lstinline + \Pearl{n,1.55}} \end{lstinline}. We get total = 2.57, which is less than 14 mm, so let&#x27;s increase both the initial value of n and the denominations that we&#x27;re summing together: n = 0 and \lstinline{, \lstinline{, 15} { \lstinline, \ldots}}. One time we get 15.31 which is greater than 14 mm, so we add one more coin at the 20th mm slot: \Pearl{19}{20}. With this update, 15.31 now exactly equals 14 mm, so the correct number of coins = 19. \boxed{19}          </p>

Response: To find a missing quantity in an equation, we need all the other information about the equation to solve for it. In this case, the missing information we have is that the coins are dime, penny, and nickel, so we know that a dime is.35 mm, a penny is.55 mm, and a nickel is.95 mm. Using these dimensions along with the length of the stack, we can set up an equation using proportions to find the answer.

Response: : Let&#x27;s think about the nickels and the quarters: half the nickels and three quarters,Right? So one of the nickels will be 1.955. Now let&#x27;s think about half of that: .9875. Now to figure out how many quarters we need to get up to14 millimeters, we can write 14=1.95(1)+1.75(h-1). That&#x27;s equivalent to 14=8.35+1.75h. h=4. Plus one quarter is 1.75.

Response: Let&#x27;s start with the penny. It&#x27;s 1.55 mm, so 1.55 + 1.5 = 3 mm. So, 3 more mm gives us 6, which is a dime. There are 2 more dimes, so 2 * 3 = 6, which is the sum of 8 and 13. That means that the stack contains 9 coins--\boxed{9}.          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: We can make a new number line to help us:

We can calculate the following:

1 penny takes up 1.55 mm space on the number line.

1 nickel takes up 1.95 mm space on the number line.

1 dime takes up 1.35 mm space on the number line.

1 quarter takes up 1.75 mm space on the number line.

We can create a ratio that compares the thickness of each coin to the height of the stack:

Heights of coins
$$\frac{1.300 mm}{1.55 mm} \ = \ \boxed{2\frac{1}{3}} ~ \text{ pifs for dimes}$$

$$\frac{1.300 mm}{1.40 mm} \ = \ \boxed{2} ~ \text{ pifs for nickels}$$

$$\frac{1.700 mm}{1.35 mm} \ = \ \boxed{2\frac{1}{3}} ~ \text{ pifs for quarters}$$

So there are \boxed{5} coins in the stack.          </p>

Response: Let&#x27;s create a function with a range of values from 1 to 100 to simulate different stacks: ``` for i in range(1, 101)     print(i) ``` We have 14 mm in our coin stack, so we need to add the corresponding pen, nickle, dime, and quarter to find the number of coins. We can write this mathematically by creating a variable for the height and filling in our function for each type of coin with the function corresponding to its thickness. We notice that the sum of the variables Nob/nonib/dime/quarter will equal 14 mm because the thicknesses add up. \boxed{8}          </p>

Problem: Determine whether a function $h(x)$, which is the sum of an $\alpha$-strongly convex function and an $L$-Lipschitz continuous gradient function, is always strongly convex. Answer with true or false. Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>

Response: A function is strongly convex if and only if it has a bounded second derivative. Check to see if the function:

$h(x) = \alpha \cdot f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T*(x-x) + 0.5L ||x_1-x||^2$

has a bounded second derivative. First, equate $\nabla h(x)$ to get

$\alpha \cdot \nabla f(x) + L(x_1-x) = \nabla f(x)$

Second, take the second derivative of $h$ to get

$\nabla^{2} h(x) = \nabla^{2} f(x) + L L^T.$

$h$ has a bounded second derivative, so $h$ is strongly convex. Check to see if the function: \boxed{false}          </p>

Reference Answer: Alright, let me try to figure out whether the function h(x), which is the sum of an α-strongly convex function and another function that has an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient, is always strongly convex. Hmm, okay. So first, I need to recall what strong convexity means and what having an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient implies.

Starting with strong convexity: A function f is called α-strongly convex if for all x, y in its domain and any θ ∈ [0,1], the following inequality holds:

f(θx + (1 - θ)y) ≤ θf(x) + (1 - θ)f(y) - (α/2)θ(1 - θ)||x - y||²

This essentially means that the function has curvature bounded below by α. Another way to think about it is that the Hessian of the function, if it&#x27;s twice differentiable, has all its eigenvalues greater than or equal to α.

Now, a function with an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient satisfies the condition that the gradient ∇g is Lipschitz continuous with constant L. That is,

||∇g(x) - ∇g(y)|| ≤ L||x - y|| for all x, y.

This has implications on the function&#x27;s smoothness. In particular, if a function has an L-Lipschitz gradient, then it is also L-smooth, which means that the eigenvalues of its Hessian (if twice differentiable) are bounded above by L. So, such a function can be convex but not necessarily strongly convex. For example, a quadratic function with Hessian eigenvalues between 0 and L would be convex with L-Lipschitz gradient but not strongly convex (since the lower bound on eigenvalues is 0).

Wait, but actually, if a function has a Lipschitz continuous gradient, does that require the function to be convex? Or can it be non-convex? Hmm. Let&#x27;s see. The Lipschitz condition on the gradient relates to smoothness, not directly to convexity. So, a function with L-Lipschitz gradient can be non-convex. For example, consider a function like g(x) = -x². Its gradient is -2x, which is Lipschitz continuous with L=2, but the function is concave, not convex. So, the Lipschitz gradient doesn&#x27;t guarantee convexity. But in the problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that h(x) is the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function. So, the L-Lipschitz gradient function might not be convex.

But wait, does the problem specify whether the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex or not? Let me check the original question again: &quot;the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, the second function is just L-Lipschitz gradient, not necessarily convex. Therefore, the L-Lipschitz gradient function could be non-convex. So, h(x) is the sum of a strongly convex function and a function with Lipschitz gradient. Is h(x) necessarily strongly convex?

I need to verify if adding a function with Lipschitz gradient to a strongly convex function preserves strong convexity. Let&#x27;s denote h(x) = f(x) + g(x), where f is α-strongly convex and g has L-Lipschitz gradient. To check if h is strongly convex, we can look at the Hessian of h (assuming twice differentiable for simplicity). The Hessian of h would be ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x). Since f is α-strongly convex, ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI. For g, since it has L-Lipschitz gradient, ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI. But does ∇²g(x) have a lower bound?

If g is not convex, then ∇²g(x) could have eigenvalues that are negative. For instance, if g is a non-convex function with Lipschitz gradient, like g(x) = - (1/2)x², then ∇²g(x) = -1. Then, adding that to the Hessian of f, which is at least αI, would result in ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - 1)I. So, if α &gt; 1, then h(x) is still strongly convex. But if α ≤ 1, then the lower bound on the Hessian of h could be non-positive, which would mean h is not strongly convex.

Wait, so if the function g has a Hessian that can be negative definite, then adding it to f&#x27;s Hessian could reduce the lower bound on the eigenvalues. Therefore, h(x) might not be strongly convex unless the &quot;strong convexity&quot; of f is enough to compensate for the possible negative eigenvalues from g.

But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify any relation between α and L. It just says &quot;an α-strongly convex function&quot; and &quot;an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, depending on the values of α and L (or more precisely, depending on the possible negative eigenvalues introduced by g), h(x) may or may not be strongly convex.

For example, suppose f is α-strongly convex, and g is a function with L-Lipschitz gradient but is concave, such as g(x) = - (L/2)||x||². Then ∇g(x) = -Lx, which is Lipschitz with constant L. Then, the Hessian of g is -LI. So, the Hessian of h(x) would be ∇²f(x) - LI. Since ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI, then ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - L)I. Therefore, h(x) is strongly convex only if α &gt; L. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) could be zero or negative, which would mean h(x) is not strongly convex.

But the problem asks if h(x) is &quot;always&quot; strongly convex. Since we can find cases where h(x) is not strongly convex (e.g., when α ≤ L and g is concave), the answer would be false.

Alternatively, if the function g with L-Lipschitz gradient is convex, then its Hessian is positive semi-definite (but eigenvalues can be up to L). Then, adding that to f, which is α-strongly convex, would result in h(x) being at least α-strongly convex. Because ∇²h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI + 0 = αI. So in this case, h(x) would be α-strongly convex.

But the problem does not state that the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex. It just says &quot;L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, g could be non-convex, as in the earlier example.

Therefore, depending on whether g is convex or not, h(x) may or may not be strongly convex. Since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that g is convex, we have to consider the general case where g could be non-convex, which would allow h(x) to potentially lose strong convexity. Hence, the statement is not always true, so the answer is false.

To confirm, let&#x27;s recap:

- If g is convex with L-Lipschitz gradient: Then ∇²g(x) ⪰ 0, so h(x) is α-strongly convex.

- If g is non-convex with L-Lipschitz gradient: Then ∇²g(x) can have negative eigenvalues (but bounded since the Lipschitz constant of gradient gives ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI). So, the lower bound on the Hessian of h(x) is αI + (lower bound of ∇²g(x)). If g&#x27;s Hessian can go as low as -βI for some β &gt; 0, then the lower bound on h&#x27;s Hessian is (α - β)I. If α &gt; β, then h is still strongly convex; otherwise, it&#x27;s not.

But without any constraints on how non-convex g can be (i.e., how negative the eigenvalues of ∇²g can be), except that the gradient is L-Lipschitz (which only gives an upper bound on the Hessian&#x27;s eigenvalues, not a lower bound), then the Hessian of g could be arbitrarily negative definite, right?

Wait, no. If the gradient is L-Lipschitz, that implies that the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian is bounded by L. However, for the minimum eigenvalue, if the function is non-convex, the Hessian can have negative eigenvalues, but how negative can they be?

Actually, the Lipschitz constant of the gradient gives us that the spectral norm of the Hessian is bounded by L. That is, ||∇²g(x)|| ≤ L. The spectral norm is the maximum singular value, which for symmetric matrices (Hessians) is the maximum absolute value of eigenvalues. So, if ∇²g(x) has eigenvalues in the range [-L, L]. So, the most negative eigenvalue can be -L. Therefore, the Hessian of g can have eigenvalues as low as -L, but not lower.

Therefore, the Hessian of h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI - LI = (α - L)I. Therefore, if α &gt; L, then h(x) is (α - L)-strongly convex. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) ≤ 0, so h(x) is not strongly convex.

But in the problem statement, there is no relation imposed between α and L. So, if α is not necessarily greater than L, then h(x) might not be strongly convex. Therefore, the answer is false.

Another angle: The sum of a strongly convex function and a convex function with Lipschitz gradient is always strongly convex. But since in the problem, the second function isn&#x27;t necessarily convex, it might subtract from the strong convexity. So, depending on the &quot;amount&quot; of non-convexity in g, h could lose strong convexity. Since the Lipschitz gradient allows for g to have Hessian eigenvalues down to -L, as shown, then if L ≥ α, h is not strongly convex. So, in general, without knowing that L &lt; α, we can&#x27;t guarantee h is strongly convex. Hence, the answer is false.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{False}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether a function \( h(x) \), which is the sum of an \(\alpha\)-strongly convex function and an \( L \)-Lipschitz continuous gradient function, is always strongly convex, we need to analyze the properties of the constituent functions.

1. **Strong Convexity**: A function \( f \) is \(\alpha\)-strongly convex if its Hessian satisfies \( \nabla^2 f(x) \succeq \alpha I \) for all \( x \). This means the eigenvalues of the Hessian are at least \(\alpha\).

2. **Lipschitz Continuous Gradient**: A function \( g \) has an \( L \)-Lipschitz continuous gradient if the spectral norm of its Hessian satisfies \( \|\nabla^2 g(x)\| \leq L \). This implies the eigenvalues of the Hessian of \( g \) are bounded in the interval \([-L, L]\).

When considering the function \( h(x) = f(x) + g(x) \):
- The Hessian of \( h \) is \( \nabla^2 h(x) = \nabla^2 f(x) + \nabla^2 g(x) \).
- Since \( f \) is \(\alpha\)-strongly convex, \( \nabla^2 f(x) \succeq \alpha I \).
- The Hessian of \( g \) can have eigenvalues as low as \(-L\) if \( g \) is non-convex.

Combining these, the Hessian of \( h \) satisfies:
\[ \nabla^2 h(x) \succeq \alpha I + (-L I) = (\alpha - L) I \]

For \( h(x) \) to be strongly convex, the lower bound on the eigenvalues of \( \nabla^2 h(x) \) must be positive, i.e., \( \alpha - L &gt; 0 \). If \( \alpha \leq L \), the lower bound on the eigenvalues is non-positive, meaning \( h(x) \) is not strongly convex.

Since the problem does not specify any relationship between \(\alpha\) and \( L \), it is possible for \( \alpha \leq L \), leading to \( h(x) \) not being strongly convex. Therefore, the function \( h(x) \) is not always strongly convex.

Reference Answer: Alright, let me try to figure out whether the function h(x), which is the sum of an α-strongly convex function and another function that has an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient, is always strongly convex. Hmm, okay. So first, I need to recall what strong convexity means and what having an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient implies.

Starting with strong convexity: A function f is called α-strongly convex if for all x, y in its domain and any θ ∈ [0,1], the following inequality holds:

f(θx + (1 - θ)y) ≤ θf(x) + (1 - θ)f(y) - (α/2)θ(1 - θ)||x - y||²

This essentially means that the function has curvature bounded below by α. Another way to think about it is that the Hessian of the function, if it&#x27;s twice differentiable, has all its eigenvalues greater than or equal to α.

Now, a function with an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient satisfies the condition that the gradient ∇g is Lipschitz continuous with constant L. That is,

||∇g(x) - ∇g(y)|| ≤ L||x - y|| for all x, y.

This has implications on the function&#x27;s smoothness. In particular, if a function has an L-Lipschitz gradient, then it is also L-smooth, which means that the eigenvalues of its Hessian (if twice differentiable) are bounded above by L. So, such a function can be convex but not necessarily strongly convex. For example, a quadratic function with Hessian eigenvalues between 0 and L would be convex with L-Lipschitz gradient but not strongly convex (since the lower bound on eigenvalues is 0).

Wait, but actually, if a function has a Lipschitz continuous gradient, does that require the function to be convex? Or can it be non-convex? Hmm. Let&#x27;s see. The Lipschitz condition on the gradient relates to smoothness, not directly to convexity. So, a function with L-Lipschitz gradient can be non-convex. For example, consider a function like g(x) = -x². Its gradient is -2x, which is Lipschitz continuous with L=2, but the function is concave, not convex. So, the Lipschitz gradient doesn&#x27;t guarantee convexity. But in the problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that h(x) is the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function. So, the L-Lipschitz gradient function might not be convex.

But wait, does the problem specify whether the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex or not? Let me check the original question again: &quot;the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, the second function is just L-Lipschitz gradient, not necessarily convex. Therefore, the L-Lipschitz gradient function could be non-convex. So, h(x) is the sum of a strongly convex function and a function with Lipschitz gradient. Is h(x) necessarily strongly convex?

I need to verify if adding a function with Lipschitz gradient to a strongly convex function preserves strong convexity. Let&#x27;s denote h(x) = f(x) + g(x), where f is α-strongly convex and g has L-Lipschitz gradient. To check if h is strongly convex, we can look at the Hessian of h (assuming twice differentiable for simplicity). The Hessian of h would be ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x). Since f is α-strongly convex, ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI. For g, since it has L-Lipschitz gradient, ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI. But does ∇²g(x) have a lower bound?

If g is not convex, then ∇²g(x) could have eigenvalues that are negative. For instance, if g is a non-convex function with Lipschitz gradient, like g(x) = - (1/2)x², then ∇²g(x) = -1. Then, adding that to the Hessian of f, which is at least αI, would result in ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - 1)I. So, if α &gt; 1, then h(x) is still strongly convex. But if α ≤ 1, then the lower bound on the Hessian of h could be non-positive, which would mean h is not strongly convex.

Wait, so if the function g has a Hessian that can be negative definite, then adding it to f&#x27;s Hessian could reduce the lower bound on the eigenvalues. Therefore, h(x) might not be strongly convex unless the &quot;strong convexity&quot; of f is enough to compensate for the possible negative eigenvalues from g.

But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify any relation between α and L. It just says &quot;an α-strongly convex function&quot; and &quot;an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, depending on the values of α and L (or more precisely, depending on the possible negative eigenvalues introduced by g), h(x) may or may not be strongly convex.

For example, suppose f is α-strongly convex, and g is a function with L-Lipschitz gradient but is concave, such as g(x) = - (L/2)||x||². Then ∇g(x) = -Lx, which is Lipschitz with constant L. Then, the Hessian of g is -LI. So, the Hessian of h(x) would be ∇²f(x) - LI. Since ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI, then ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - L)I. Therefore, h(x) is strongly convex only if α &gt; L. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) could be zero or negative, which would mean h(x) is not strongly convex.

But the problem asks if h(x) is &quot;always&quot; strongly convex. Since we can find cases where h(x) is not strongly convex (e.g., when α ≤ L and g is concave), the answer would be false.

Alternatively, if the function g with L-Lipschitz gradient is convex, then its Hessian is positive semi-definite (but eigenvalues can be up to L). Then, adding that to f, which is α-strongly convex, would result in h(x) being at least α-strongly convex. Because ∇²h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI + 0 = αI. So in this case, h(x) would be α-strongly convex.

But the problem does not state that the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex. It just says &quot;L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, g could be non-convex, as in the earlier example.

Therefore, depending on whether g is convex or not, h(x) may or may not be strongly convex. Since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that g is convex, we have to consider the general case where g could be non-convex, which would allow h(x) to potentially lose strong convexity. Hence, the statement is not always true, so the answer is false.

To confirm, let&#x27;s recap:

- If g is convex with L-Lipschitz gradient: Then ∇²g(x) ⪰ 0, so h(x) is α-strongly convex.

- If g is non-convex with L-Lipschitz gradient: Then ∇²g(x) can have negative eigenvalues (but bounded since the Lipschitz constant of gradient gives ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI). So, the lower bound on the Hessian of h(x) is αI + (lower bound of ∇²g(x)). If g&#x27;s Hessian can go as low as -βI for some β &gt; 0, then the lower bound on h&#x27;s Hessian is (α - β)I. If α &gt; β, then h is still strongly convex; otherwise, it&#x27;s not.

But without any constraints on how non-convex g can be (i.e., how negative the eigenvalues of ∇²g can be), except that the gradient is L-Lipschitz (which only gives an upper bound on the Hessian&#x27;s eigenvalues, not a lower bound), then the Hessian of g could be arbitrarily negative definite, right?

Wait, no. If the gradient is L-Lipschitz, that implies that the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian is bounded by L. However, for the minimum eigenvalue, if the function is non-convex, the Hessian can have negative eigenvalues, but how negative can they be?

Actually, the Lipschitz constant of the gradient gives us that the spectral norm of the Hessian is bounded by L. That is, ||∇²g(x)|| ≤ L. The spectral norm is the maximum singular value, which for symmetric matrices (Hessians) is the maximum absolute value of eigenvalues. So, if ∇²g(x) has eigenvalues in the range [-L, L]. So, the most negative eigenvalue can be -L. Therefore, the Hessian of g can have eigenvalues as low as -L, but not lower.

Therefore, the Hessian of h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI - LI = (α - L)I. Therefore, if α &gt; L, then h(x) is (α - L)-strongly convex. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) ≤ 0, so h(x) is not strongly convex.

But in the problem statement, there is no relation imposed between α and L. So, if α is not necessarily greater than L, then h(x) might not be strongly convex. Therefore, the answer is false.

Another angle: The sum of a strongly convex function and a convex function with Lipschitz gradient is always strongly convex. But since in the problem, the second function isn&#x27;t necessarily convex, it might subtract from the strong convexity. So, depending on the &quot;amount&quot; of non-convexity in g, h could lose strong convexity. Since the Lipschitz gradient allows for g to have Hessian eigenvalues down to -L, as shown, then if L ≥ α, h is not strongly convex. So, in general, without knowing that L &lt; α, we can&#x27;t guarantee h is strongly convex. Hence, the answer is false.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{False}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether a function \( h(x) \), which is the sum of an \(\alpha\)-strongly convex function and an \( L \)-Lipschitz continuous gradient function, is always strongly convex, we need to analyze the properties of the constituent functions.

1. **Strong Convexity**: A function \( f \) is \(\alpha\)-strongly convex if its Hessian satisfies \( \nabla^2 f(x) \succeq \alpha I \) for all \( x \). This means the eigenvalues of the Hessian are at least \(\alpha\).

2. **Lipschitz Continuous Gradient**: A function \( g \) has an \( L \)-Lipschitz continuous gradient if the spectral norm of its Hessian satisfies \( \|\nabla^2 g(x)\| \leq L \). This implies the eigenvalues of the Hessian of \( g \) are bounded in the interval \([-L, L]\).

When considering the function \( h(x) = f(x) + g(x) \):
- The Hessian of \( h \) is \( \nabla^2 h(x) = \nabla^2 f(x) + \nabla^2 g(x) \).
- Since \( f \) is \(\alpha\)-strongly convex, \( \nabla^2 f(x) \succeq \alpha I \).
- The Hessian of \( g \) can have eigenvalues as low as \(-L\) if \( g \) is non-convex.

Combining these, the Hessian of \( h \) satisfies:
\[ \nabla^2 h(x) \succeq \alpha I + (-L I) = (\alpha - L) I \]

For \( h(x) \) to be strongly convex, the lower bound on the eigenvalues of \( \nabla^2 h(x) \) must be positive, i.e., \( \alpha - L &gt; 0 \). If \( \alpha \leq L \), the lower bound on the eigenvalues is non-positive, meaning \( h(x) \) is not strongly convex.

Since the problem does not specify any relationship between \(\alpha\) and \( L \), it is possible for \( \alpha \leq L \), leading to \( h(x) \) not being strongly convex. Therefore, the function \( h(x) \) is not always strongly convex.

Problem: Determine whether a function $h(x)$, which is the sum of an $\alpha$-strongly convex function and an $L$-Lipschitz continuous gradient function, is always strongly convex. Answer with true or false. Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>

Response: Suppose we have:

$h(x) = f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T x$

Assuming $n$ is even, $x_n = x_{n-1} + \alpha x_{n-1}$, and we have:

$h(x_{n}) = f(x_n) + \nabla f(x_n)^T x_n$

We can then write:

$f(x_n) + \nabla f(x_n)^T x_n = f(x_{n-1}) + (1 + \alpha) \nabla f(x_{n-1})^T x_{n-1}$

Substituting in the equation for $x_n$:

$(1 + \alpha) \nabla f(x_{n-1})^T x_{n-1} - \nabla f(x_{n-1})^T x_{n-1} + \nabla f(x_{n-1})^T x_{n-1} = f(x_n) + \nabla f(x_n)^T x_n$

The right side is $h(x_n)$. We can simplify the LHS:

... times $x_n$:

$H x_n = (1 + \alpha) f(x_{n-1}) + 2\alpha \nabla f(x_{n-1})^T x_{n-1} + \nabla f(x_n)^T x_n$

If the cost function $f$ is $\alpha$-strongly convex, then for any $x_n$, $H x_n = f(x_n) + \alpha \nabla f(x_n)^T x_n$. By substitution, $H x_n = f(x_n)$.

Assuming $\nabla f(x_n)$ is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant $L$, we can say $g(x) = f(x) + Linear \left[L \nabla f(x)\right]$ is also Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant $L$. $H x_n = f(x_n)$.

We know the gradient of a Latty Lipschitz continuous function is Lipschitz continuous (and continuous), and $n$ is even. $g(x) = f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T x$ is $\alpha$-strongly convex with constant $L$. $H x_n = f(x_n)$&lt;|end_of_text|&gt;          </p>

Reference Answer: Alright, let me try to figure out whether the function h(x), which is the sum of an α-strongly convex function and another function that has an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient, is always strongly convex. Hmm, okay. So first, I need to recall what strong convexity means and what having an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient implies.

Starting with strong convexity: A function f is called α-strongly convex if for all x, y in its domain and any θ ∈ [0,1], the following inequality holds:

f(θx + (1 - θ)y) ≤ θf(x) + (1 - θ)f(y) - (α/2)θ(1 - θ)||x - y||²

This essentially means that the function has curvature bounded below by α. Another way to think about it is that the Hessian of the function, if it&#x27;s twice differentiable, has all its eigenvalues greater than or equal to α.

Now, a function with an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient satisfies the condition that the gradient ∇g is Lipschitz continuous with constant L. That is,

||∇g(x) - ∇g(y)|| ≤ L||x - y|| for all x, y.

This has implications on the function&#x27;s smoothness. In particular, if a function has an L-Lipschitz gradient, then it is also L-smooth, which means that the eigenvalues of its Hessian (if twice differentiable) are bounded above by L. So, such a function can be convex but not necessarily strongly convex. For example, a quadratic function with Hessian eigenvalues between 0 and L would be convex with L-Lipschitz gradient but not strongly convex (since the lower bound on eigenvalues is 0).

Wait, but actually, if a function has a Lipschitz continuous gradient, does that require the function to be convex? Or can it be non-convex? Hmm. Let&#x27;s see. The Lipschitz condition on the gradient relates to smoothness, not directly to convexity. So, a function with L-Lipschitz gradient can be non-convex. For example, consider a function like g(x) = -x². Its gradient is -2x, which is Lipschitz continuous with L=2, but the function is concave, not convex. So, the Lipschitz gradient doesn&#x27;t guarantee convexity. But in the problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that h(x) is the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function.

Let me check the original question again: &quot;the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, the second function is just L-Lipschitz gradient, not necessarily convex. Therefore, the L-Lipschitz gradient function could be non-convex. So, h(x) is the sum of a strongly convex function and a function with Lipschitz gradient. Is h(x) necessarily strongly convex?

I need to verify if adding a function with Lipschitz gradient to a strongly convex function preserves strong convexity. Let&#x27;s denote h(x) = f(x) + g(x), where f is α-strongly convex and g has L-Lipschitz gradient. To check if h is strongly convex, we can look at the Hessian of h (assuming twice differentiable for simplicity). The Hessian of h would be ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x). Since f is α-strongly convex, ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI. For g, since it has L-Lipschitz gradient, ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI. But does ∇²g(x) have a lower bound?

If g is not convex, then ∇²g(x) could have eigenvalues that are negative. For instance, if g is a non-convex function with Lipschitz gradient, like g(x) = - (1/2)x², then ∇²g(x) = -1. Then, adding that to the Hessian of f, which is at least αI, would result in ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - 1)I. So, if α &gt; 1, then h(x) is still strongly convex. But if α ≤ 1, then the lower bound on the Hessian of h could be non-positive, which would mean h is not strongly convex.

Wait, so if the function g has a Hessian that can be negative definite, then adding it to f&#x27;s Hessian could reduce the lower bound on the eigenvalues. Therefore, h(x) might not be strongly convex unless the &quot;strong convexity&quot; of f is enough to compensate for the possible negative eigenvalues from g.

But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify any relation between α and L. It just says &quot;an α-strongly convex function&quot; and &quot;an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, depending on the values of α and L (or more precisely, depending on the possible negative eigenvalues introduced by g), h(x) may or may not be strongly convex.

For example, suppose f is α-strongly convex, and g is a function with L-Lipschitz gradient but is concave, such as g(x) = - (L/2)||x||². Then ∇g(x) = -Lx, which is Lipschitz with constant L. Then, the Hessian of g is -LI. So, the Hessian of h(x) would be ∇²f(x) - LI. Since ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI, then ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - L)I. Therefore, h(x) is strongly convex only if α &gt; L. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) could be zero or negative, which would mean h(x) is not strongly convex.

But the problem asks if h(x) is &quot;always&quot; strongly convex. Since we can find cases where h(x) is not strongly convex (e.g., when α ≤ L and g is concave), the answer would be false.

Alternatively, if the function g with L-Lipschitz gradient is convex, then its Hessian is positive semi-definite (but eigenvalues can be up to L). Then, adding that to f, which is α-strongly convex, would result in h(x) being at least α-strongly convex. Because ∇²h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI + 0 = αI. So in this case, h(x) would be α-strongly convex.

But the problem does not state that the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex. It just says &quot;L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, g could be non-convex, as in the earlier example.

Therefore, depending on whether g is convex or not, h(x) may or may not be strongly convex. Since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that g is convex, we have to consider the general case where g could be non-convex, which would allow h(x) to potentially lose strong convexity. Hence, the statement is not always true, so the answer is false.

To confirm, let&#x27;s recap:

- If g is convex with L-Lipschitz gradient: Then ∇²g(x) ⪰ 0, so h(x) is α-strongly convex.

- If g is non-convex with L-Lipschitz gradient: Then ∇²g(x) can have negative eigenvalues (but bounded since the Lipschitz constant of gradient gives ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI). So, the lower bound on the Hessian of h(x) is αI + (lower bound of ∇²g(x)). If g&#x27;s Hessian can go as low as -βI for some β &gt; 0, then the lower bound on h&#x27;s Hessian is (α - β)I. If α &gt; β, then h is still strongly convex; otherwise, it&#x27;s not.

But without any constraints on how non-convex g can be (i.e., how negative the eigenvalues of ∇²g can be), except that the gradient is L-Lipschitz (which only gives an upper bound on the Hessian&#x27;s eigenvalues, not a lower bound), then the Hessian of g could be arbitrarily negative definite, right?

Wait, no. If the gradient is L-Lipschitz, that implies that the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian is bounded by L. However, for the minimum eigenvalue, if the function is non-convex, the Hessian can have negative eigenvalues, but how negative can they be?

Actually, the Lipschitz constant of the gradient gives us that the spectral norm of the Hessian is bounded by L. That is, ||∇²g(x)|| ≤ L. The spectral norm is the maximum singular value, which for symmetric matrices (Hessians) is the maximum absolute value of eigenvalues. So, if ∇²g(x) has eigenvalues in the range [-L, L]. So, the most negative eigenvalue can be -L. Therefore, the Hessian of g can have eigenvalues as low as -L, but not lower.

Therefore, the Hessian of h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI - LI = (α - L)I. Therefore, if α &gt; L, then h(x) is (α - L)-strongly convex. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) ≤ 0, so h(x) is not strongly convex.

But in the problem statement, there is no relation imposed between α and L. So, if α is not necessarily greater than L, then h(x) might not be strongly convex. Therefore, the answer is false.

Another angle: The sum of a strongly convex function and a convex function with Lipschitz gradient is always strongly convex. But since in the problem, the second function isn&#x27;t necessarily convex, it might subtract from the strong convexity. So, depending on the &quot;amount&quot; of non-convexity in g, h could lose strong convexity. Since the Lipschitz gradient allows for g to have Hessian eigenvalues down to -L, as shown, then if L ≥ α, h is not strongly convex. So, in general, without knowing that L &lt; α, we can&#x27;t guarantee h is strongly convex. Hence, the answer is false.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{False}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether a function \( h(x) \), which is the sum of an \(\alpha\)-strongly convex function and an \( L \)-Lipschitz continuous gradient function, is always strongly convex, we need to analyze the properties of the constituent functions.

1. **Strong Convexity**: A function \( f \) is \(\alpha\)-strongly convex if its Hessian satisfies \( \nabla^2 f(x) \succeq \alpha I \) for all \( x \). This means the eigenvalues of the Hessian are at least \(\alpha\).

2. **Lipschitz Continuous Gradient**: A function \( g \) has an \( L \)-Lipschitz continuous gradient if the spectral norm of its Hessian satisfies \( \|\nabla^2 g(x)\| \leq L \). This implies the eigenvalues of the Hessian of \( g \) are bounded in the interval \([-L, L]\).

When considering the function \( h(x) = f(x) + g(x) \):
- The Hessian of \( h \) is \( \nabla^2 h(x) = \nabla^2 f(x) + \nabla^2 g(x) \).
- Since \( f \) is \(\alpha\)-strongly convex, \( \nabla^2 f(x) \succeq \alpha I \).
- The Hessian of \( g \) can have eigenvalues as low as \(-L\) if \( g \) is non-convex.

Combining these, the Hessian of \( h \) satisfies:
\[ \nabla^2 h(x) \succeq \alpha I + (-L I) = (\alpha - L) I \]

For \( h(x) \) to be strongly convex, the lower bound on the eigenvalues of \( \nabla^2 h(x) \) must be positive, i.e., \( \alpha - L &gt; 0 \). If \( \alpha \leq L \), the lower bound on the eigenvalues is non-positive, meaning \( h(x) \) is not strongly convex.

Since the problem does not specify any relationship between \(\alpha\) and \( L \), it is possible for \( \alpha \leq L \), leading to \( h(x) \) not being strongly convex. Therefore, the function \( h(x) \) is not always strongly convex.

Reference Answer: Alright, let me try to figure out whether the function h(x), which is the sum of an α-strongly convex function and another function that has an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient, is always strongly convex. Hmm, okay. So first, I need to recall what strong convexity means and what having an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient implies.

Starting with strong convexity: A function f is called α-strongly convex if for all x, y in its domain and any θ ∈ [0,1], the following inequality holds:

f(θx + (1 - θ)y) ≤ θf(x) + (1 - θ)f(y) - (α/2)θ(1 - θ)||x - y||²

This essentially means that the function has curvature bounded below by α. Another way to think about it is that the Hessian of the function, if it&#x27;s twice differentiable, has all its eigenvalues greater than or equal to α.

Now, a function with an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient satisfies the condition that the gradient ∇g is Lipschitz continuous with constant L. That is,

||∇g(x) - ∇g(y)|| ≤ L||x - y|| for all x, y.

This has implications on the function&#x27;s smoothness. In particular, if a function has an L-Lipschitz gradient, then it is also L-smooth, which means that the eigenvalues of its Hessian (if twice differentiable) are bounded above by L. So, such a function can be convex but not necessarily strongly convex. For example, a quadratic function with Hessian eigenvalues between 0 and L would be convex with L-Lipschitz gradient but not strongly convex (since the lower bound on eigenvalues is 0).

Wait, but actually, if a function has a Lipschitz continuous gradient, does that require the function to be convex? Or can it be non-convex? Hmm. Let&#x27;s see. The Lipschitz condition on the gradient relates to smoothness, not directly to convexity. So, a function with L-Lipschitz gradient can be non-convex. For example, consider a function like g(x) = -x². Its gradient is -2x, which is Lipschitz continuous with L=2, but the function is concave, not convex. So, the Lipschitz gradient doesn&#x27;t guarantee convexity. But in the problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that h(x) is the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function. So, the L-Lipschitz gradient function might not be convex.

But wait, does the problem specify whether the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex or not? Let me check the original question again: &quot;the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, the second function is just L-Lipschitz gradient, not necessarily convex. Therefore, the L-Lipschitz gradient function could be non-convex. So, h(x) is the sum of a strongly convex function and a function with Lipschitz gradient. Is h(x) necessarily strongly convex?

I need to verify if adding a function with Lipschitz gradient to a strongly convex function preserves strong convexity. Let&#x27;s denote h(x) = f(x) + g(x), where f is α-strongly convex and g has L-Lipschitz gradient. To check if h is strongly convex, we can look at the Hessian of h (assuming twice differentiable for simplicity). The Hessian of h would be ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x). Since f is α-strongly convex, ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI. For g, since it has L-Lipschitz gradient, ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI. But does ∇²g(x) have a lower bound?

If g is not convex, then ∇²g(x) could have eigenvalues that are negative. For instance, if g is a non-convex function with Lipschitz gradient, like g(x) = - (1/2)x², then ∇²g(x) = -1. Then, adding that to the Hessian of f, which is at least αI, would result in ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - 1)I. So, if α &gt; 1, then h(x) is still strongly convex. But if α ≤ 1, then the lower bound on the Hessian of h could be non-positive, which would mean h is not strongly convex.

Wait, so if the function g has a Hessian that can be negative definite, then adding it to f&#x27;s Hessian could reduce the lower bound on the eigenvalues. Therefore, h(x) might not be strongly convex unless the &quot;strong convexity&quot; of f is enough to compensate for the possible negative eigenvalues from g.

But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify any relation between α and L. It just says &quot;an α-strongly convex function&quot; and &quot;an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, depending on the values of α and L (or more precisely, depending on the possible negative eigenvalues introduced by g), h(x) may or may not be strongly convex.

For example, suppose f is α-strongly convex, and g is a function with L-Lipschitz gradient but is concave, such as g(x) = - (L/2)||x||². Then ∇g(x) = -Lx, which is Lipschitz with constant L. Then, the Hessian of g is -LI. So, the Hessian of h(x) would be ∇²f(x) - LI. Since ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI, then ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - L)I. Therefore, h(x) is strongly convex only if α &gt; L. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) could be zero or negative, which would mean h(x) is not strongly convex.

But the problem asks if h(x) is &quot;always&quot; strongly convex. Since we can find cases where h(x) is not strongly convex (e.g., when α ≤ L and g is concave), the answer would be false.

Alternatively, if the function g with L-Lipschitz gradient is convex, then its Hessian is positive semi-definite (but eigenvalues can be up to L). Then, adding that to f, which is α-strongly convex, would result in h(x) being at least α-strongly convex. Because ∇²h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI + 0 = αI. So in this case, h(x) would be α-strongly convex.

But the problem does not state that the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex. It just says &quot;L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, g could be non-convex, as in the earlier example.

Therefore, depending on whether g is convex or not, h(x) may or may not be strongly convex. Since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that g is convex, we have to consider the general case where g could be non-convex, which would allow h(x) to potentially lose strong convexity. Hence, the statement is not always true, so the answer is false.

So, the lower bound on the Hessian of h(x) is αI + (lower bound of ∇²g(x)). If g&#x27;s Hessian can go as low as -βI for some β &gt; 0, then the lower bound on h&#x27;s Hessian is (α - β)I. If α &gt; β, then h is still strongly convex; otherwise, it&#x27;s not.

But without any constraints on how non-convex g can be (i.e., how negative the eigenvalues of ∇²g can be), except that the gradient is L-Lipschitz (which only gives an upper bound on the Hessian&#x27;s eigenvalues, not a lower bound), then the Hessian of g could be arbitrarily negative definite, right?

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to recall what strong convexity means and what having an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient implies.

Starting with strong convexity: A function f is called α-strongly convex if for all x, y in its domain and any θ ∈ [0,1], the following inequality holds:

f(θx + (1 - θ)y) ≤ θf(x) + (1 - θ)f(y) - (α/2)θ(1 - θ)||x - y||²

This essentially means that the function has curvature bounded below by α. Another way to think about it is that the Hessian of the function, if it&#x27;s twice differentiable, has all its eigenvalues greater than or equal to α.

Now, a function with an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient satisfies the condition that the gradient ∇g is Lipschitz continuous with constant L. That is,

||∇g(x) - ∇g(y)|| ≤ L||x - y|| for all x, y.

This has implications on the function&#x27;s smoothness. In particular, if a function has an L-Lipschitz gradient, then it is also L-smooth, which means that the eigenvalues of its Hessian (if twice differentiable) are bounded above by L. So, such a function can be convex but not necessarily strongly convex. For example, a quadratic function with Hessian eigenvalues between 0 and L would be convex with L-Lipschitz gradient but not strongly convex (since the lower bound on eigenvalues is 0).

Wait, but actually, if a function has a Lipschitz continuous gradient, does that require the function to be convex? Or can it be non-convex? Hmm. Let&#x27;s see. The Lipschitz condition on the gradient relates to smoothness, not directly to convexity. So, a function with L-Lipschitz gradient can be non-convex. For example, consider a function like g(x) = -x². Its gradient is -2x, which is Lipschitz continuous with L=2, but the function is concave, not convex. So, the Lipschitz gradient doesn&#x27;t guarantee convexity. But in the problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that h(x) is the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function. So, the L-Lipschitz gradient function might not be convex.

But wait, does the problem specify whether the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex or not? Let me check the original question again: &quot;the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, the second function is just L-Lipschitz gradient, not necessarily convex. Therefore, the L-Lipschitz gradient function could be non-convex. So, h(x) is the sum of a strongly convex function and a function with Lipschitz gradient. Is h(x) necessarily strongly convex?

I need to verify if adding a function with Lipschitz gradient to a strongly convex function preserves strong convexity. Let&#x27;s denote h(x) = f(x) + g(x), where f is α-strongly convex and g has L-Lipschitz gradient. To check if h is strongly convex, we can look at the Hessian of h (assuming twice differentiable for simplicity). The Hessian of h would be ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x). Since f is α-strongly convex, ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI. For g, since it has L-Lipschitz gradient, ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI. But does ∇²g(x) have a lower bound?

If g is not convex, then ∇²g(x) could have eigenvalues that are negative. For instance, if g is a non-convex function with Lipschitz gradient, like g(x) = - (1/2)x², then ∇²g(x) = -1. Then, adding that to the Hessian of f, which is at least αI, would result in ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - 1)I. So, if α &gt; 1, then h(x) is still strongly convex. But if α ≤ 1, then the lower bound on the Hessian of h could be non-positive, which would mean h is not strongly convex.

Wait, so if the function g has a Hessian that can be negative definite, then adding it to f&#x27;s Hessian could reduce the lower bound on the eigenvalues. Therefore, h(x) might not be strongly convex unless the &quot;strong convexity&quot; of f is enough to compensate for the possible negative eigenvalues from g.

But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify any relation between α and L. It just says &quot;an α-strongly convex function&quot; and &quot;an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, depending on the values of α and L (or more precisely, depending on the possible negative eigenvalues introduced by g), h(x) may or may not be strongly convex.

For example, suppose f is α-strongly convex, and g is a function with L-Lipschitz gradient but is concave, such as g(x) = - (L/2)||x||². Then ∇g(x) = -Lx, which is Lipschitz with constant L. Then, the Hessian of g is -LI. So, the Hessian of h(x) would be ∇²f(x) - LI. Since ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI, then ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - L)I. Therefore, h(x) is strongly convex only if α &gt; L. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) could be zero or negative, which would mean h(x) is not strongly convex.

But the problem asks if h(x) is &quot;always&quot; strongly convex. Since we can find cases where h(x) is not strongly convex (e.g., when α ≤ L and g is concave), the answer would be false.

Alternatively, if the function g with L-Lipschitz gradient is convex, then its Hessian is positive semi-definite (but eigenvalues can be up to L). Then, adding that to f, which is α-strongly convex, would result in h(x) being at least α-strongly convex. Because ∇²h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI + 0 = αI. So in this case, h(x) would be α-strongly convex.

But the problem does not state that the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex. It just says &quot;L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, g could be non-convex, as in the earlier example.

Therefore, depending on whether g is convex or not, h(x) may or may not be strongly convex. Since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that g is convex, we have to consider the general case where g could be non-convex, which would allow h(x) to potentially lose strong convexity. Hence, the statement is not always true, so the answer is false.

To confirm, let&#x27;s recap:

- If g is convex with L-Lipschitz gradient: Then ∇²g(x) ⪰ 0, so h(x) is α-strongly convex.

- If g is non-convex with L-Lipschitz gradient: Then ∇²g(x) can have negative eigenvalues (but bounded since the Lipschitz constant of gradient gives ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI). So, the lower bound on the Hessian of h(x) is αI + (lower bound of ∇²g(x)). If g&#x27;s Hessian can go as low as -βI for some β &gt; 0, then the lower bound on h&#x27;s Hessian is (α - β)I. If α &gt; β, then h is still strongly convex; otherwise, it&#x27;s not.

But without any constraints on how non-convex g can be (i.e., how negative the eigenvalues of ∇²g can be), except that the gradient is L-Lipschitz (which only gives an upper bound on the Hessian&#x27;s eigenvalues, not a lower bound), then the Hessian of g could be arbitrarily negative definite, right?

Wait, no. If the gradient is L-Lipschitz, that implies that the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian is bounded by L. However, for the minimum eigenvalue, if the function is non-convex, the Hessian can have negative eigenvalues, but how negative can they be?

Actually, the Lipschitz constant of the gradient gives us that the spectral norm of the Hessian is bounded by L. That is, ||∇²g(x)|| ≤ L. The spectral norm is the maximum singular value, which for symmetric matrices (Hessians) is the maximum absolute value of eigenvalues. So, if ∇²g(x) has eigenvalues in the range [-L, L]. So, the most negative eigenvalue can be -L. Therefore, the Hessian of g can have eigenvalues as low as -L, but not lower.

Therefore, the Hessian of h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI - LI = (α - L)I. Therefore, if α &gt; L, then h(x) is (α - L)-strongly convex. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) ≤ 0, so h(x) is not strongly convex.

But in the problem statement, there is no relation imposed between α and L. So, if α is not necessarily greater than L, then h(x) might not be strongly convex. Therefore, the answer is false.

Another angle: The sum of a strongly convex function and a convex function with Lipschitz gradient is always strongly convex. But since in the problem, the second function isn&#x27;t necessarily convex, it might subtract from the strong convexity. So, depending on the &quot;amount&quot; of non-convexity in g, h could lose strong convexity. Since the Lipschitz gradient allows for g to have Hessian eigenvalues down to -L, as shown, then if L ≥ α, h is not strongly convex. So, in general, without knowing that L &lt; α, we can&#x27;t guarantee h is strongly convex. Hence, the answer is false.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{False}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether a function \( h(x) \), which is the sum of an \(\alpha\)-strongly convex function and an \( L \)-Lipschitz continuous gradient function, is always strongly convex, we need to analyze the properties of the constituent functions.

1. **Strong Convexity**: A function \( f \) is \(\alpha\)-strongly convex if its Hessian satisfies \( \nabla^2 f(x) \succeq \alpha I \) for all \( x \). This means the eigenvalues of the Hessian are at least \(\alpha\).

2. **Lipschitz Continuous Gradient**: A function \( g \) has an \( L \)-Lipschitz continuous gradient if the spectral norm of its Hessian satisfies \( \|\nabla^2 g(x)\| \leq L \). This implies the eigenvalues of the Hessian of \( g \) are bounded in the interval \([-L, L]\).

When considering the function \( h(x) = f(x) + g(x) \):
- The Hessian of \( h \) is \( \nabla^2 h(x) = \nabla^2 f(x) + \nabla^2 g(x) \).
- Since \( f \) is \(\alpha\)-strongly convex, \( \nabla^2 f(x) \succeq \alpha I \).
- The Hessian of \( g \) can have eigenvalues as low as \(-L\) if \( g \) is non-convex.

Combining these, the Hessian of \( h \) satisfies:
\[ \nabla^2 h(x) \succeq \alpha I + (-L I) = (\alpha - L) I \]

For \( h(x) \) to be strongly convex, the lower bound on the eigenvalues of \( \nabla^2 h(x) \) must be positive, i.e., \( \alpha - L &gt; 0 \). If \( \alpha \leq L \), the lower bound on the eigenvalues is non-positive, meaning \( h(x) \) is not strongly convex.

Since the problem does not specify any relationship between \(\alpha\) and \( L \), it is possible for \( \alpha \leq L \), leading to \( h(x) \) not being strongly convex. Therefore, the function \( h(x) \) is not always strongly convex.

Reference Answer: Alright, let me try to figure out whether the function h(x), which is the sum of an α-strongly convex function and another function that has an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient, is always strongly convex. Hmm, okay. So first, I need to recall what strong convexity means and what having an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient implies.

Starting with strong convexity: A function f is called α-strongly convex if for all x, y in its domain and any θ ∈ [0,1], the following inequality holds:

f(θx + (1 - θ)y) ≤ θf(x) + (1 - θ)f(y) - (α/2)θ(1 - θ)||x - y||²

This essentially means that the function has curvature bounded below by α. Another way to think about it is that the Hessian of the function, if it&#x27;s twice differentiable, has all its eigenvalues greater than or equal to α.

Now, a function with an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient satisfies the condition that the gradient ∇g is Lipschitz continuous with constant L. That is,

||∇g(x) - ∇g(y)|| ≤ L||x - y|| for all x, y.

This has implications on the function&#x27;s smoothness. In particular, if a function has an L-Lipschitz gradient, then it is also L-smooth, which means that the eigenvalues of its Hessian (if twice differentiable) are bounded above by L. So, such a function can be convex but not necessarily strongly convex. For example, a quadratic function with Hessian eigenvalues between 0 and L would be convex with L-Lipschitz gradient but not strongly convex (since the lower bound on eigenvalues is 0).

Wait, but actually, if a function has a Lipschitz continuous gradient, does that require the function to be convex? Or can it be non-convex? Hmm. Let&#x27;s see. The Lipschitz condition on the gradient relates to smoothness, not directly to convexity. So, a function with L-Lipschitz gradient can be non-convex. For example, consider a function like g(x) = -x². Its gradient is -2x, which is Lipschitz continuous with L=2, but the function is concave, not convex. So, the Lipschitz gradient doesn&#x27;t guarantee convexity. But in the problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that h(x) is the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function. So, the L-Lipschitz gradient function might not be convex.

But wait, does the problem specify whether the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex or not? Let me check the original question again: &quot;the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, the second function is just L-Lipschitz gradient, not necessarily convex. Therefore, the L-Lipschitz gradient function could be non-convex. So, h(x) is the sum of a strongly convex function and a function with Lipschitz gradient. Is h(x) necessarily strongly convex?

I need to verify if adding a function with Lipschitz gradient to a strongly convex function preserves strong convexity. Let&#x27;s denote h(x) = f(x) + g(x), where f is α-strongly convex and g has L-Lipschitz gradient. To check if h is strongly convex, we can look at the Hessian of h (assuming twice differentiable for simplicity). The Hessian of h would be ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x). Since f is α-strongly convex, ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI. For g, since it has L-Lipschitz gradient, ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI. But does ∇²g(x) have a lower bound?

If g is not convex, then ∇²g(x) could have eigenvalues that are negative. For instance, if g is a non-convex function with Lipschitz gradient, like g(x) = - (1/2)x², then ∇²g(x) = -1. Then, adding that to the Hessian of f, which is at least αI, would result in ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - 1)I. So, if α &gt; 1, then h(x) is still strongly convex. But if α ≤ 1, then the lower bound on the Hessian of h could be non-positive, which would mean h is not strongly convex.

Wait, so if the function g has a Hessian that can be negative definite, then adding it to f&#x27;s Hessian could reduce the lower bound on the eigenvalues. Therefore, h(x) might not be strongly convex unless the &quot;strong convexity&quot; of f is enough to compensate for the possible negative eigenvalues from g.

But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify any relation between α and L. It just says &quot;an α-strongly convex function&quot; and &quot;an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, depending on the values of α and L (or more precisely, depending on the possible negative eigenvalues introduced by g), h(x) may or may not be strongly convex.

For example, suppose f is α-strongly convex, and g is a function with L-Lipschitz gradient but is concave, such as g(x) = - (L/2)||x||². Then ∇g(x) = -Lx, which is Lipschitz with constant L. Then, the Hessian of g is -LI. So, the Hessian of h(x) would be ∇²f(x) - LI. Since ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI, then ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - L)I. Therefore, h(x) is strongly convex only if α &gt; L. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) could be zero or negative, which would mean h(x) is not strongly convex.

But the problem asks if h(x) is &quot;always&quot; strongly convex. Since we can find cases where h(x) is not strongly convex (e.g., when α ≤ L and g is concave), the answer would be false.

Alternatively, if the function g with L-Lipschitz gradient is convex, then its Hessian is positive semi-definite (but eigenvalues can be up to L). Then, adding that to f, which is α-strongly convex, would result in h(x) being at least α-strongly convex. Because ∇²h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI + 0 = αI. So in this case, h(x) would be α-strongly convex.

But the problem does not state that the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex. It just says &quot;L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, g could be non-convex, as in the earlier example.

Therefore, depending on whether g is convex or not, h(x) may or may not be strongly convex. Since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that g is convex, we have to consider the general case where g could be non-convex, which would allow h(x) to potentially lose strong convexity. Hence, the statement is not always true, so the answer is false.

To confirm, let&#x27;s recap:

- If g is convex with L-Lipschitz gradient: Then ∇²g(x) ⪰ 0, so h(x) is α-strongly convex.

- If g is non-convex with L-Lipschitz gradient: Then ∇²g(x) can have negative eigenvalues (but bounded since the Lipschitz constant of gradient gives ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI). So, the lower bound on the Hessian of h(x) is αI + (lower bound of ∇²g(x)). If g&#x27;s Hessian can go as low as -βI for some β &gt; 0, then the lower bound on h&#x27;s Hessian is (α - β)I. If α &gt; β, then h is still strongly convex; otherwise, it&#x27;s not.

But without any constraints on how non-convex g can be (i.e., how negative the eigenvalues of ∇²g can be), except that the gradient is L-Lipschitz (which only gives an upper bound on the Hessian&#x27;s eigenvalues, not a lower bound), then the Hessian of g could be arbitrarily negative definite, right?

Wait, no. If the gradient is L-Lipschitz, that implies that the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian is bounded by L. However, for the minimum eigenvalue, if the function is non-convex, the Hessian can have negative eigenvalues, but how negative can they be?

Actually, the Lipschitz constant of the gradient gives us that the spectral norm of the Hessian is bounded by L. That is, ||∇²g(x)|| ≤ L. The spectral norm is the maximum singular value, which for symmetric matrices (Hessians) is the maximum absolute value of eigenvalues. So, if ∇²g(x) has eigenvalues in the range [-L, L]. So, the most negative eigenvalue can be -L. Therefore, the Hessian of g can have eigenvalues as low as -L, but not lower.

Therefore, the Hessian of h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI - LI = (α - L)I. Therefore, if α &gt; L, then h(x) is (α - L)-strongly convex. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) ≤ 0, so h(x) is not strongly convex.

But in the problem statement, there is no relation imposed between α and L. So, if α is not necessarily greater than L, then h(x) might not be strongly convex. Therefore, the answer is false.

So, in general, without knowing that L &lt; α, we can&#x27;t guarantee h is strongly convex. Hence, the answer is false.

- The Hessian of \( h \) is \( \nabla^2 h(x) = \nabla^2 f(x) + \nabla^2 g(x) \).
- Since \( f \) is \(\alpha\)-strongly convex, \( \nabla^2 f(x) \succeq \alpha I \).
- The Hessian of \( g \) can have eigenvalues as low as \(-L\) if \( g \) is non-convex.

Combining these, the Hessian of \( h \) satisfies:
\[ \nabla^2 h(x) \succeq \alpha I + (-L I) = (\alpha - L) I \]

For \( h(x) \) to be strongly convex, the lower bound on the eigenvalues of \( \nabla^2 h(x) \) must be positive, i.e., \( \alpha - L &gt; 0 \). If \( \alpha \leq L \), the lower bound on the eigenvalues is non-positive, meaning \( h(x) \) is not strongly convex.

Now, a function with an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient satisfies the condition that the gradient ∇g is Lipschitz continuous with constant L. That is,

||∇g(x) - ∇g(y)|| ≤ L||x - y|| for all x, y.

This has implications on the function&#x27;s smoothness.

To determine whether a function \( h(x) \), which is the sum of an \(\alpha\)-strongly convex function and an \( L \)-Lipschitz continuous gradient function, is always strongly convex, we need to analyze the properties of the constituent functions.

When considering the function \( h(x) = f(x) + g(x) \):
- The Hessian of \( h \) is \( \nabla^2 h(x) = \nabla^2 f(x) + \nabla^2 g(x) \).
- Since \( f \) is \(\alpha\)-strongly convex, \( \nabla^2 f(x) \succeq \alpha I \).
- The Hessian of \( g \) can have eigenvalues as low as \(-L\) if \( g \) is non-convex.

Combining these, the Hessian of \( h \) satisfies:
\[ \nabla^2 h(x) \succeq \alpha I + (-L I) = (\alpha - L) I \]

For \( h(x) \) to be strongly convex, the lower bound on the eigenvalues of \( \nabla^2 h(x) \) must be positive, i.e., \( \alpha - L &gt; 0 \). If \( \alpha \leq L \), the lower bound on the eigenvalues is non-positive, meaning \( h(x) \) is not strongly convex.

Reference Answer: Alright, let me try to figure out whether the function h(x), which is the sum of an α-strongly convex function and another function that has an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient, is always strongly convex. Hmm, okay. So first, I need to recall what strong convexity means and what having an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient implies.

Starting with strong convexity: A function f is called α-strongly convex if for all x, y in its domain and any θ ∈ [0,1], the following inequality holds:

f(θx + (1 - θ)y) ≤ θf(x) + (1 - θ)f(y) - (α/2)θ(1 - θ)||x - y||²

This essentially means that the function has curvature bounded below by α. Another way to think about it is that the Hessian of the function, if it&#x27;s twice differentiable, has all its eigenvalues greater than or equal to α.

Now, a function with an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient satisfies the condition that the gradient ∇g is Lipschitz continuous with constant L. That is,

||∇g(x) - ∇g(y)|| ≤ L||x - y|| for all x, y.

This has implications on the function&#x27;s smoothness. In particular, if a function has an L-Lipschitz gradient, then it is also L-smooth, which means that the eigenvalues of its Hessian (if twice differentiable) are bounded above by L. So, such a function can be convex but not necessarily strongly convex. For example, a quadratic function with Hessian eigenvalues between 0 and L would be convex with L-Lipschitz gradient but not strongly convex (since the lower bound on eigenvalues is 0).

Wait, but actually, if a function has a Lipschitz continuous gradient, does that require the function to be convex? Or can it be non-convex? Hmm. Let&#x27;s see. The Lipschitz condition on the gradient relates to smoothness, not directly to convexity. So, a function with L-Lipschitz gradient can be non-convex. For example, consider a function like g(x) = -x². Its gradient is -2x, which is Lipschitz continuous with L=2, but the function is concave, not convex. So, the Lipschitz gradient doesn&#x27;t guarantee convexity. But in the problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that h(x) is the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function. So, the L-Lipschitz gradient function might not be convex.

But wait, does the problem specify whether the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex or not? Let me check the original question again: &quot;the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, the second function is just L-Lipschitz gradient, not necessarily convex. Therefore, the L-Lipschitz gradient function could be non-convex. So, h(x) is the sum of a strongly convex function and a function with Lipschitz gradient. Is h(x) necessarily strongly convex?

I need to verify if adding a function with Lipschitz gradient to a strongly convex function preserves strong convexity. Let&#x27;s denote h(x) = f(x) + g(x), where f is α-strongly convex and g has L-Lipschitz gradient. To check if h is strongly convex, we can look at the Hessian of h (assuming twice differentiable for simplicity). The Hessian of h would be ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x). Since f is α-strongly convex, ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI. For g, since it has L-Lipschitz gradient, ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI. But does ∇²g(x) have a lower bound?

If g is not convex, then ∇²g(x) could have eigenvalues that are negative. For instance, if g is a non-convex function with Lipschitz gradient, like g(x) = - (1/2)x², then ∇²g(x) = -1. Then, adding that to the Hessian of f, which is at least αI, would result in ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - 1)I. So, if α &gt; 1, then h(x) is still strongly convex. But if α ≤ 1, then the lower bound on the Hessian of h could be non-positive, which would mean h is not strongly convex.

Wait, so if the function g has a Hessian that can be negative definite, then adding it to f&#x27;s Hessian could reduce the lower bound on the eigenvalues. Therefore, h(x) might not be strongly convex unless the &quot;strong convexity&quot; of f is enough to compensate for the possible negative eigenvalues from g.

But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify any relation between α and L. It just says &quot;an α-strongly convex function&quot; and &quot;an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, depending on the values of α and L (or more precisely, depending on the possible negative eigenvalues introduced by g), h(x) may or may not be strongly convex.

For example, suppose f is α-strongly convex, and g is a function with L-Lipschitz gradient but is concave, such as g(x) = - (L/2)||x||². Then ∇g(x) = -Lx, which is Lipschitz with constant L. Then, the Hessian of g is -LI. So, the Hessian of h(x) would be ∇²f(x) - LI. Since ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI, then ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - L)I. Therefore, h(x) is strongly convex only if α &gt; L. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) could be zero or negative, which would mean h(x) is not strongly convex.

But the problem asks if h(x) is &quot;always&quot; strongly convex. Since we can find cases where h(x) is not strongly convex (e.g., when α ≤ L and g is concave), the answer would be false.

Alternatively, if the function g with L-Lipschitz gradient is convex, then its Hessian is positive semi-definite (but eigenvalues can be up to L). Then, adding that to f, which is α-strongly convex, would result in h(x) being at least α-strongly convex. Because ∇²h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI + 0 = αI. So in this case, h(x) would be α-strongly convex.

But the problem does not state that the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex. It just says &quot;L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, g could be non-convex, as in the earlier example.

Therefore, depending on whether g is convex or not, h(x) may or may not be strongly convex. Since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that g is convex, we have to consider the general case where g could be non-convex, which would allow h(x) to potentially lose strong convexity. Hence, the statement is not always true, so the answer is false.

To confirm, let&#x27;s recap:

- If g is convex with L-Lipschitz gradient: Then ∇²g(x) ⪰ 0, so h(x) is α-strongly convex.

- If g is non-convex with L-Lipschitz gradient: Then ∇²g(x) can have negative eigenvalues (but bounded since the Lipschitz constant of gradient gives ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI). So, the lower bound on the Hessian of h(x) is αI + (lower bound of ∇²g(x)). If g&#x27;s Hessian can go as low as -βI for some β &gt; 0, then the lower bound on h&#x27;s Hessian is (α - β)I. If α &gt; β, then h is still strongly convex; otherwise, it&#x27;s not.

But without any constraints on how non-convex g can be (i.e., how negative the eigenvalues of ∇²g can be), except that the gradient is L-Lipschitz (which only gives an upper bound on the Hessian&#x27;s eigenvalues, not a lower bound), then the Hessian of g could be arbitrarily negative definite, right?

Wait, no. If the gradient is L-Lipschitz, that implies that the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian is bounded by L. However, for the minimum eigenvalue, if the function is non-convex, the Hessian can have negative eigenvalues, but how negative can they be?

Actually, the Lipschitz constant of the gradient gives us that the spectral norm of the Hessian is bounded by L. That is, ||∇²g(x)|| ≤ L. The spectral norm is the maximum singular value, which for symmetric matrices (Hessians) is the maximum absolute value of eigenvalues. So, if ∇²g(x) has eigenvalues in the range [-L, L]. So, the most negative eigenvalue can be -L. Therefore, the Hessian of g can have eigenvalues as low as -L, but not lower.

Therefore, the Hessian of h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI - LI = (α - L)I. Therefore, if α &gt; L, then h(x) is (α - L)-strongly convex. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) ≤ 0, so h(x) is not strongly convex.

But in the problem statement, there is no relation imposed between α and L. So, if α is not necessarily greater than L, then h(x) might not be strongly convex. Therefore, the answer is false.

Another angle: The sum of a strongly convex function and a convex function with Lipschitz gradient is always strongly convex. But since in the problem, the second function isn&#x27;t necessarily convex, it might subtract from the strong convexity. So, depending on the &quot;amount&quot; of non-convexity in g, h could lose strong convexity. Since the Lipschitz gradient allows for g to have Hessian eigenvalues down to -L, as shown, then if L ≥ α, h is not strongly convex. So, in general, without knowing that L &lt; α, we can&#x27;t guarantee h is strongly convex. Hence, the answer is false.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{False}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether a function \( h(x) \), which is the sum of an \(\alpha\)-strongly convex function and an \( L \)-Lipschitz continuous gradient function, is always strongly convex, we need to analyze the properties of the constituent functions.

1. **Strong Convexity**: A function \( f \) is \(\alpha\)-strongly convex if its Hessian satisfies \( \nabla^2 f(x) \succeq \alpha I \) for all \( x \). This means the eigenvalues of the Hessian are at least \(\alpha\).

2. **Lipschitz Continuous Gradient**: A function \( g \) has an \( L \)-Lipschitz continuous gradient if the spectral norm of its Hessian satisfies \( \|\nabla^2 g(x)\| \leq L \). This implies the eigenvalues of the Hessian of \( g \) are bounded in the interval \([-L, L]\).

When considering the function \( h(x) = f(x) + g(x) \):
- The Hessian of \( h \) is \( \nabla^2 h(x) = \nabla^2 f(x) + \nabla^2 g(x) \).
- Since \( f \) is \(\alpha\)-strongly convex, \( \nabla^2 f(x) \succeq \alpha I \).
- The Hessian of \( g \) can have eigenvalues as low as \(-L\) if \( g \) is non-convex.

Combining these, the Hessian of \( h \) satisfies:
\[ \nabla^2 h(x) \succeq \alpha I + (-L I) = (\alpha - L) I \]

For \( h(x) \) to be strongly convex, the lower bound on the eigenvalues of \( \nabla^2 h(x) \) must be positive, i.e., \( \alpha - L &gt; 0 \). If \( \alpha \leq L \), the lower bound on the eigenvalues is non-positive, meaning \( h(x) \) is not strongly convex.

Since the problem does not specify any relationship between \(\alpha\) and \( L \), it is possible for \( \alpha \leq L \), leading to \( h(x) \) not being strongly convex. Therefore, the function \( h(x) \) is not always strongly convex.

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to recall what strong convexity means and what having an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient implies.

Starting with strong convexity: A function f is called α-strongly convex if for all x, y in its domain and any θ ∈ [0,1], the following inequality holds:

f(θx + (1 - θ)y) ≤ θf(x) + (1 - θ)f(y) - (α/2)θ(1 - θ)||x - y||²

This essentially means that the function has curvature bounded below by α. Another way to think about it is that the Hessian of the function, if it&#x27;s twice differentiable, has all its eigenvalues greater than or equal to α.

Now, a function with an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient satisfies the condition that the gradient ∇g is Lipschitz continuous with constant L. That is,

||∇g(x) - ∇g(y)|| ≤ L||x - y|| for all x, y.

This has implications on the function&#x27;s smoothness. In particular, if a function has an L-Lipschitz gradient, then it is also L-smooth, which means that the eigenvalues of its Hessian (if twice differentiable) are bounded above by L. So, such a function can be convex but not necessarily strongly convex. For example, a quadratic function with Hessian eigenvalues between 0 and L would be convex with L-Lipschitz gradient but not strongly convex (since the lower bound on eigenvalues is 0).

Wait, but actually, if a function has a Lipschitz continuous gradient, does that require the function to be convex? Or can it be non-convex? Hmm. Let&#x27;s see. The Lipschitz condition on the gradient relates to smoothness, not directly to convexity. So, a function with L-Lipschitz gradient can be non-convex. For example, consider a function like g(x) = -x². Its gradient is -2x, which is Lipschitz continuous with L=2, but the function is concave, not convex. So, the Lipschitz gradient doesn&#x27;t guarantee convexity. But in the problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that h(x) is the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function.

So, h(x) is the sum of a strongly convex function and a function with Lipschitz gradient. Is h(x) necessarily strongly convex?

I need to verify if adding a function with Lipschitz gradient to a strongly convex function preserves strong convexity. Let&#x27;s denote h(x) = f(x) + g(x), where f is α-strongly convex and g has L-Lipschitz gradient. To check if h is strongly convex, we can look at the Hessian of h (assuming twice differentiable for simplicity). The Hessian of h would be ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x). Since f is α-strongly convex, ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI. For g, since it has L-Lipschitz gradient, ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI. But does ∇²g(x) have a lower bound?

If g is not convex, then ∇²g(x) could have eigenvalues that are negative. For instance, if g is a non-convex function with Lipschitz gradient, like g(x) = - (1/2)x², then ∇²g(x) = -1. Then, adding that to the Hessian of f, which is at least αI, would result in ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - 1)I. So, if α &gt; 1, then h(x) is still strongly convex. But if α ≤ 1, then the lower bound on the Hessian of h could be non-positive, which would mean h is not strongly convex.

Wait, so if the function g has a Hessian that can be negative definite, then adding it to f&#x27;s Hessian could reduce the lower bound on the eigenvalues. Therefore, h(x) might not be strongly convex unless the &quot;strong convexity&quot; of f is enough to compensate for the possible negative eigenvalues from g.

But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify any relation between α and L. It just says &quot;an α-strongly convex function&quot; and &quot;an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, depending on the values of α and L (or more precisely, depending on the possible negative eigenvalues introduced by g), h(x) may or may not be strongly convex.

For example, suppose f is α-strongly convex, and g is a function with L-Lipschitz gradient but is concave, such as g(x) = - (L/2)||x||². Then ∇g(x) = -Lx, which is Lipschitz with constant L. Then, the Hessian of g is -LI. So, the Hessian of h(x) would be ∇²f(x) - LI. Since ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI, then ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - L)I. Therefore, h(x) is strongly convex only if α &gt; L. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) could be zero or negative, which would mean h(x) is not strongly convex.

But the problem asks if h(x) is &quot;always&quot; strongly convex. Since we can find cases where h(x) is not strongly convex (e.g., when α ≤ L and g is concave), the answer would be false.

Alternatively, if the function g with L-Lipschitz gradient is convex, then its Hessian is positive semi-definite (but eigenvalues can be up to L).

So in this case, h(x) would be α-strongly convex.

- The Hessian of \( g \) can have eigenvalues as low as \(-L\) if \( g \) is non-convex.

Combining these, the Hessian of \( h \) satisfies:

Let&#x27;s denote h(x) = f(x) + g(x), where f is α-strongly convex and g has L-Lipschitz gradient. To check if h is strongly convex, we can look at the Hessian of h (assuming twice differentiable for simplicity). The Hessian of h would be ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x). Since f is α-strongly convex, ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI. For g, since it has L-Lipschitz gradient, ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI. But does ∇²g(x) have a lower bound?

If g is not convex, then ∇²g(x) could have eigenvalues that are negative. For instance, if g is a non-convex function with Lipschitz gradient, like g(x) = - (1/2)x², then ∇²g(x) = -1. Then, adding that to the Hessian of f, which is at least αI, would result in ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - 1)I. So, if α &gt; 1, then h(x) is still strongly convex. But if α ≤ 1, then the lower bound on the Hessian of h could be non-positive, which would mean h is not strongly convex.

Wait, so if the function g has a Hessian that can be negative definite, then adding it to f&#x27;s Hessian could reduce the lower bound on the eigenvalues. Therefore, h(x) might not be strongly convex unless the &quot;strong convexity&quot; of f is enough to compensate for the possible negative eigenvalues from g.

But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify any relation between α and L. It just says &quot;an α-strongly convex function&quot; and &quot;an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, depending on the values of α and L (or more precisely, depending on the possible negative eigenvalues introduced by g), h(x) may or may not be strongly convex.

For example, suppose f is α-strongly convex, and g is a function with L-Lipschitz gradient but is concave, such as g(x) = - (L/2)||x||². Then ∇g(x) = -Lx, which is Lipschitz with constant L. Then, the Hessian of g is -LI. So, the Hessian of h(x) would be ∇²f(x) - LI. Since ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI, then ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - L)I. Therefore, h(x) is strongly convex only if α &gt; L. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) could be zero or negative, which would mean h(x) is not strongly convex.

But the problem asks if h(x) is &quot;always&quot; strongly convex. Since we can find cases where h(x) is not strongly convex (e.g., when α ≤ L and g is concave), the answer would be false.

Alternatively, if the function g with L-Lipschitz gradient is convex, then its Hessian is positive semi-definite (but eigenvalues can be up to L). Then, adding that to f, which is α-strongly convex, would result in h(x) being at least α-strongly convex. Because ∇²h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI + 0 = αI. So in this case, h(x) would be α-strongly convex.

But the problem does not state that the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex. It just says &quot;L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, g could be non-convex, as in the earlier example.

Therefore, depending on whether g is convex or not, h(x) may or may not be strongly convex. Since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that g is convex, we have to consider the general case where g could be non-convex, which would allow h(x) to potentially lose strong convexity. Hence, the statement is not always true, so the answer is false.

To confirm, let&#x27;s recap:

- If g is convex with L-Lipschitz gradient: Then ∇²g(x) ⪰ 0, so h(x) is α-strongly convex.

- If g is non-convex with L-Lipschitz gradient: Then ∇²g(x) can have negative eigenvalues (but bounded since the Lipschitz constant of gradient gives ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI). So, the lower bound on the Hessian of h(x) is αI + (lower bound of ∇²g(x)). If g&#x27;s Hessian can go as low as -βI for some β &gt; 0, then the lower bound on h&#x27;s Hessian is (α - β)I. If α &gt; β, then h is still strongly convex; otherwise, it&#x27;s not.

But without any constraints on how non-convex g can be (i.e., how negative the eigenvalues of ∇²g can be), except that the gradient is L-Lipschitz (which only gives an upper bound on the Hessian&#x27;s eigenvalues, not a lower bound), then the Hessian of g could be arbitrarily negative definite, right?

Wait, no. If the gradient is L-Lipschitz, that implies that the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian is bounded by L. However, for the minimum eigenvalue, if the function is non-convex, the Hessian can have negative eigenvalues, but how negative can they be?

Actually, the Lipschitz constant of the gradient gives us that the spectral norm of the Hessian is bounded by L. That is, ||∇²g(x)|| ≤ L. The spectral norm is the maximum singular value, which for symmetric matrices (Hessians) is the maximum absolute value of eigenvalues. So, if ∇²g(x) has eigenvalues in the range [-L, L]. So, the most negative eigenvalue can be -L. Therefore, the Hessian of g can have eigenvalues as low as -L, but not lower.

Therefore, the Hessian of h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI - LI = (α - L)I. Therefore, if α &gt; L, then h(x) is (α - L)-strongly convex. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) ≤ 0, so h(x) is not strongly convex.

But in the problem statement, there is no relation imposed between α and L. So, if α is not necessarily greater than L, then h(x) might not be strongly convex. Therefore, the answer is false.

Another angle: The sum of a strongly convex function and a convex function with Lipschitz gradient is always strongly convex. But since in the problem, the second function isn&#x27;t necessarily convex, it might subtract from the strong convexity. So, depending on the &quot;amount&quot; of non-convexity in g, h could lose strong convexity. Since the Lipschitz gradient allows for g to have Hessian eigenvalues down to -L, as shown, then if L ≥ α, h is not strongly convex. So, in general, without knowing that L &lt; α, we can&#x27;t guarantee h is strongly convex. Hence, the answer is false.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{False}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether a function \( h(x) \), which is the sum of an \(\alpha\)-strongly convex function and an \( L \)-Lipschitz continuous gradient function, is always strongly convex, we need to analyze the properties of the constituent functions.

1. **Strong Convexity**: A function \( f \) is \(\alpha\)-strongly convex if its Hessian satisfies \( \nabla^2 f(x) \succeq \alpha I \) for all \( x \). This means the eigenvalues of the Hessian are at least \(\alpha\).

2. **Lipschitz Continuous Gradient**: A function \( g \) has an \( L \)-Lipschitz continuous gradient if the spectral norm of its Hessian satisfies \( \|\nabla^2 g(x)\| \leq L \). This implies the eigenvalues of the Hessian of \( g \) are bounded in the interval \([-L, L]\).

When considering the function \( h(x) = f(x) + g(x) \):
- The Hessian of \( h \) is \( \nabla^2 h(x) = \nabla^2 f(x) + \nabla^2 g(x) \).
- Since \( f \) is \(\alpha\)-strongly convex, \( \nabla^2 f(x) \succeq \alpha I \).
- The Hessian of \( g \) can have eigenvalues as low as \(-L\) if \( g \) is non-convex.

Combining these, the Hessian of \( h \) satisfies:
\[ \nabla^2 h(x) \succeq \alpha I + (-L I) = (\alpha - L) I \]

For \( h(x) \) to be strongly convex, the lower bound on the eigenvalues of \( \nabla^2 h(x) \) must be positive, i.e., \( \alpha - L &gt; 0 \). If \( \alpha \leq L \), the lower bound on the eigenvalues is non-positive, meaning \( h(x) \) is not strongly convex.

Since the problem does not specify any relationship between \(\alpha\) and \( L \), it is possible for \( \alpha \leq L \), leading to \( h(x) \) not being strongly convex. Therefore, the function \( h(x) \) is not always strongly convex.

Reference Answer: Alright, let me try to figure out whether the function h(x), which is the sum of an α-strongly convex function and another function that has an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient, is always strongly convex. Hmm, okay. So first, I need to recall what strong convexity means and what having an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient implies.

Starting with strong convexity: A function f is called α-strongly convex if for all x, y in its domain and any θ ∈ [0,1], the following inequality holds:

f(θx + (1 - θ)y) ≤ θf(x) + (1 - θ)f(y) - (α/2)θ(1 - θ)||x - y||²

This essentially means that the function has curvature bounded below by α. Another way to think about it is that the Hessian of the function, if it&#x27;s twice differentiable, has all its eigenvalues greater than or equal to α.

Now, a function with an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient satisfies the condition that the gradient ∇g is Lipschitz continuous with constant L. That is,

||∇g(x) - ∇g(y)|| ≤ L||x - y|| for all x, y.

This has implications on the function&#x27;s smoothness. In particular, if a function has an L-Lipschitz gradient, then it is also L-smooth, which means that the eigenvalues of its Hessian (if twice differentiable) are bounded above by L. So, such a function can be convex but not necessarily strongly convex. For example, a quadratic function with Hessian eigenvalues between 0 and L would be convex with L-Lipschitz gradient but not strongly convex (since the lower bound on eigenvalues is 0).

Wait, but actually, if a function has a Lipschitz continuous gradient, does that require the function to be convex? Or can it be non-convex? Hmm. Let&#x27;s see. The Lipschitz condition on the gradient relates to smoothness, not directly to convexity. So, a function with L-Lipschitz gradient can be non-convex. For example, consider a function like g(x) = -x². Its gradient is -2x, which is Lipschitz continuous with L=2, but the function is concave, not convex. So, the Lipschitz gradient doesn&#x27;t guarantee convexity. But in the problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that h(x) is the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function. So, the L-Lipschitz gradient function might not be convex.

But wait, does the problem specify whether the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex or not? Let me check the original question again: &quot;the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, the second function is just L-Lipschitz gradient, not necessarily convex. Therefore, the L-Lipschitz gradient function could be non-convex. So, h(x) is the sum of a strongly convex function and a function with Lipschitz gradient. Is h(x) necessarily strongly convex?

I need to verify if adding a function with Lipschitz gradient to a strongly convex function preserves strong convexity. Let&#x27;s denote h(x) = f(x) + g(x), where f is α-strongly convex and g has L-Lipschitz gradient. To check if h is strongly convex, we can look at the Hessian of h (assuming twice differentiable for simplicity). The Hessian of h would be ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x). Since f is α-strongly convex, ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI. For g, since it has L-Lipschitz gradient, ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI. But does ∇²g(x) have a lower bound?

If g is not convex, then ∇²g(x) could have eigenvalues that are negative. For instance, if g is a non-convex function with Lipschitz gradient, like g(x) = - (1/2)x², then ∇²g(x) = -1. Then, adding that to the Hessian of f, which is at least αI, would result in ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - 1)I. So, if α &gt; 1, then h(x) is still strongly convex. But if α ≤ 1, then the lower bound on the Hessian of h could be non-positive, which would mean h is not strongly convex.

Wait, so if the function g has a Hessian that can be negative definite, then adding it to f&#x27;s Hessian could reduce the lower bound on the eigenvalues. Therefore, h(x) might not be strongly convex unless the &quot;strong convexity&quot; of f is enough to compensate for the possible negative eigenvalues from g.

But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify any relation between α and L. It just says &quot;an α-strongly convex function&quot; and &quot;an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, depending on the values of α and L (or more precisely, depending on the possible negative eigenvalues introduced by g), h(x) may or may not be strongly convex.

For example, suppose f is α-strongly convex, and g is a function with L-Lipschitz gradient but is concave, such as g(x) = - (L/2)||x||². Then ∇g(x) = -Lx, which is Lipschitz with constant L. Then, the Hessian of g is -LI. So, the Hessian of h(x) would be ∇²f(x) - LI. Since ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI, then ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - L)I. Therefore, h(x) is strongly convex only if α &gt; L. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) could be zero or negative, which would mean h(x) is not strongly convex.

But the problem asks if h(x) is &quot;always&quot; strongly convex. Since we can find cases where h(x) is not strongly convex (e.g., when α ≤ L and g is concave), the answer would be false.

Alternatively, if the function g with L-Lipschitz gradient is convex, then its Hessian is positive semi-definite (but eigenvalues can be up to L). Then, adding that to f, which is α-strongly convex, would result in h(x) being at least α-strongly convex. Because ∇²h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI + 0 = αI. So in this case, h(x) would be α-strongly convex.

But the problem does not state that the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex. It just says &quot;L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, g could be non-convex, as in the earlier example.

Therefore, depending on whether g is convex or not, h(x) may or may not be strongly convex. Since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that g is convex, we have to consider the general case where g could be non-convex, which would allow h(x) to potentially lose strong convexity.

So, the lower bound on the Hessian of h(x) is αI + (lower bound of ∇²g(x)). If g&#x27;s Hessian can go as low as -βI for some β &gt; 0, then the lower bound on h&#x27;s Hessian is (α - β)I. If α &gt; β, then h is still strongly convex; otherwise, it&#x27;s not.

But without any constraints on how non-convex g can be (i.e., how negative the eigenvalues of ∇²g can be), except that the gradient is L-Lipschitz (which only gives an upper bound on the Hessian&#x27;s eigenvalues, not a lower bound), then the Hessian of g could be arbitrarily negative definite, right?

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to recall what strong convexity means and what having an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient implies.

Starting with strong convexity: A function f is called α-strongly convex if for all x, y in its domain and any θ ∈ [0,1], the following inequality holds:

f(θx + (1 - θ)y) ≤ θf(x) + (1 - θ)f(y) - (α/2)θ(1 - θ)||x - y||²

This essentially means that the function has curvature bounded below by α. Another way to think about it is that the Hessian of the function, if it&#x27;s twice differentiable, has all its eigenvalues greater than or equal to α.

Now, a function with an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient satisfies the condition that the gradient ∇g is Lipschitz continuous with constant L. That is,

||∇g(x) - ∇g(y)|| ≤ L||x - y|| for all x, y.

This has implications on the function&#x27;s smoothness. In particular, if a function has an L-Lipschitz gradient, then it is also L-smooth, which means that the eigenvalues of its Hessian (if twice differentiable) are bounded above by L. So, such a function can be convex but not necessarily strongly convex. For example, a quadratic function with Hessian eigenvalues between 0 and L would be convex with L-Lipschitz gradient but not strongly convex (since the lower bound on eigenvalues is 0).

Wait, but actually, if a function has a Lipschitz continuous gradient, does that require the function to be convex? Or can it be non-convex? Hmm. Let&#x27;s see. The Lipschitz condition on the gradient relates to smoothness, not directly to convexity. So, a function with L-Lipschitz gradient can be non-convex. For example, consider a function like g(x) = -x². Its gradient is -2x, which is Lipschitz continuous with L=2, but the function is concave, not convex. So, the Lipschitz gradient doesn&#x27;t guarantee convexity. But in the problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that h(x) is the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function. So, the L-Lipschitz gradient function might not be convex.

But wait, does the problem specify whether the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex or not? Let me check the original question again: &quot;the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, the second function is just L-Lipschitz gradient, not necessarily convex. Therefore, the L-Lipschitz gradient function could be non-convex. So, h(x) is the sum of a strongly convex function and a function with Lipschitz gradient. Is h(x) necessarily strongly convex?

I need to verify if adding a function with Lipschitz gradient to a strongly convex function preserves strong convexity. Let&#x27;s denote h(x) = f(x) + g(x), where f is α-strongly convex and g has L-Lipschitz gradient. To check if h is strongly convex, we can look at the Hessian of h (assuming twice differentiable for simplicity). The Hessian of h would be ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x). Since f is α-strongly convex, ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI. For g, since it has L-Lipschitz gradient, ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI. But does ∇²g(x) have a lower bound?

If g is not convex, then ∇²g(x) could have eigenvalues that are negative. For instance, if g is a non-convex function with Lipschitz gradient, like g(x) = - (1/2)x², then ∇²g(x) = -1. Then, adding that to the Hessian of f, which is at least αI, would result in ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - 1)I. So, if α &gt; 1, then h(x) is still strongly convex. But if α ≤ 1, then the lower bound on the Hessian of h could be non-positive, which would mean h is not strongly convex.

Wait, so if the function g has a Hessian that can be negative definite, then adding it to f&#x27;s Hessian could reduce the lower bound on the eigenvalues. Therefore, h(x) might not be strongly convex unless the &quot;strong convexity&quot; of f is enough to compensate for the possible negative eigenvalues from g.

But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify any relation between α and L. It just says &quot;an α-strongly convex function&quot; and &quot;an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, depending on the values of α and L (or more precisely, depending on the possible negative eigenvalues introduced by g), h(x) may or may not be strongly convex.

For example, suppose f is α-strongly convex, and g is a function with L-Lipschitz gradient but is concave, such as g(x) = - (L/2)||x||². Then ∇g(x) = -Lx, which is Lipschitz with constant L. Then, the Hessian of g is -LI. So, the Hessian of h(x) would be ∇²f(x) - LI. Since ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI, then ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - L)I. Therefore, h(x) is strongly convex only if α &gt; L. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) could be zero or negative, which would mean h(x) is not strongly convex.

But the problem asks if h(x) is &quot;always&quot; strongly convex. Since we can find cases where h(x) is not strongly convex (e.g., when α ≤ L and g is concave), the answer would be false.

Alternatively, if the function g with L-Lipschitz gradient is convex, then its Hessian is positive semi-definite (but eigenvalues can be up to L). Then, adding that to f, which is α-strongly convex, would result in h(x) being at least α-strongly convex. Because ∇²h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI + 0 = αI. So in this case, h(x) would be α-strongly convex.

But the problem does not state that the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex. It just says &quot;L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, g could be non-convex, as in the earlier example.

Therefore, depending on whether g is convex or not, h(x) may or may not be strongly convex. Since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that g is convex, we have to consider the general case where g could be non-convex, which would allow h(x) to potentially lose strong convexity. Hence, the statement is not always true, so the answer is false.

To confirm, let&#x27;s recap:

- If g is convex with L-Lipschitz gradient: Then ∇²g(x) ⪰ 0, so h(x) is α-strongly convex.

- If g is non-convex with L-Lipschitz gradient: Then ∇²g(x) can have negative eigenvalues (but bounded since the Lipschitz constant of gradient gives ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI). So, the lower bound on the Hessian of h(x) is αI + (lower bound of ∇²g(x)). If g&#x27;s Hessian can go as low as -βI for some β &gt; 0, then the lower bound on h&#x27;s Hessian is (α - β)I. If α &gt; β, then h is still strongly convex; otherwise, it&#x27;s not.

But without any constraints on how non-convex g can be (i.e., how negative the eigenvalues of ∇²g can be), except that the gradient is L-Lipschitz (which only gives an upper bound on the Hessian&#x27;s eigenvalues, not a lower bound), then the Hessian of g could be arbitrarily negative definite, right?

Wait, no. If the gradient is L-Lipschitz, that implies that the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian is bounded by L. However, for the minimum eigenvalue, if the function is non-convex, the Hessian can have negative eigenvalues, but how negative can they be?

Actually, the Lipschitz constant of the gradient gives us that the spectral norm of the Hessian is bounded by L. That is, ||∇²g(x)|| ≤ L. The spectral norm is the maximum singular value, which for symmetric matrices (Hessians) is the maximum absolute value of eigenvalues. So, if ∇²g(x) has eigenvalues in the range [-L, L]. So, the most negative eigenvalue can be -L. Therefore, the Hessian of g can have eigenvalues as low as -L, but not lower.

Therefore, the Hessian of h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI - LI = (α - L)I. Therefore, if α &gt; L, then h(x) is (α - L)-strongly convex. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) ≤ 0, so h(x) is not strongly convex.

But in the problem statement, there is no relation imposed between α and L. So, if α is not necessarily greater than L, then h(x) might not be strongly convex. Therefore, the answer is false.

Another angle: The sum of a strongly convex function and a convex function with Lipschitz gradient is always strongly convex. But since in the problem, the second function isn&#x27;t necessarily convex, it might subtract from the strong convexity. So, depending on the &quot;amount&quot; of non-convexity in g, h could lose strong convexity. Since the Lipschitz gradient allows for g to have Hessian eigenvalues down to -L, as shown, then if L ≥ α, h is not strongly convex. So, in general, without knowing that L &lt; α, we can&#x27;t guarantee h is strongly convex. Hence, the answer is false.

\boxed{False}

To determine whether a function \( h(x) \), which is the sum of an \(\alpha\)-strongly convex function and an \( L \)-Lipschitz continuous gradient function, is always strongly convex, we need to analyze the properties of the constituent functions.

1. **Strong Convexity**: A function \( f \) is \(\alpha\)-strongly convex if its Hessian satisfies \( \nabla^2 f(x) \succeq \alpha I \) for all \( x \). This means the eigenvalues of the Hessian are at least \(\alpha\).

2. **Lipschitz Continuous Gradient**: A function \( g \) has an \( L \)-Lipschitz continuous gradient if the spectral norm of its Hessian satisfies \( \|\nabla^2 g(x)\| \leq L \). This implies the eigenvalues of the Hessian of \( g \) are bounded in the interval \([-L, L]\).

When considering the function \( h(x) = f(x) + g(x) \):
- The Hessian of \( h \) is \( \nabla^2 h(x) = \nabla^2 f(x) + \nabla^2 g(x) \).
- Since \( f \) is \(\alpha\)-strongly convex, \( \nabla^2 f(x) \succeq \alpha I \).
- The Hessian of \( g \) can have eigenvalues as low as \(-L\) if \( g \) is non-convex.

Combining these, the Hessian of \( h \) satisfies:
\[ \nabla^2 h(x) \succeq \alpha I + (-L I) = (\alpha - L) I \]

For \( h(x) \) to be strongly convex, the lower bound on the eigenvalues of \( \nabla^2 h(x) \) must be positive, i.e., \( \alpha - L &gt; 0 \). If \( \alpha \leq L \), the lower bound on the eigenvalues is non-positive, meaning \( h(x) \) is not strongly convex.

Since the problem does not specify any relationship between \(\alpha\) and \( L \), it is possible for \( \alpha \leq L \), leading to \( h(x) \) not being strongly convex. Therefore, the function \( h(x) \) is not always strongly convex.

Reference Answer: Alright, let me try to figure out whether the function h(x), which is the sum of an α-strongly convex function and another function that has an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient, is always strongly convex. Hmm, okay. So first, I need to recall what strong convexity means and what having an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient implies.

Starting with strong convexity: A function f is called α-strongly convex if for all x, y in its domain and any θ ∈ [0,1], the following inequality holds:

f(θx + (1 - θ)y) ≤ θf(x) + (1 - θ)f(y) - (α/2)θ(1 - θ)||x - y||²

This essentially means that the function has curvature bounded below by α. Another way to think about it is that the Hessian of the function, if it&#x27;s twice differentiable, has all its eigenvalues greater than or equal to α.

Now, a function with an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient satisfies the condition that the gradient ∇g is Lipschitz continuous with constant L. That is,

||∇g(x) - ∇g(y)|| ≤ L||x - y|| for all x, y.

This has implications on the function&#x27;s smoothness. In particular, if a function has an L-Lipschitz gradient, then it is also L-smooth, which means that the eigenvalues of its Hessian (if twice differentiable) are bounded above by L. So, such a function can be convex but not necessarily strongly convex. For example, a quadratic function with Hessian eigenvalues between 0 and L would be convex with L-Lipschitz gradient but not strongly convex (since the lower bound on eigenvalues is 0).

Wait, but actually, if a function has a Lipschitz continuous gradient, does that require the function to be convex? Or can it be non-convex? Hmm. Let&#x27;s see. The Lipschitz condition on the gradient relates to smoothness, not directly to convexity. So, a function with L-Lipschitz gradient can be non-convex. For example, consider a function like g(x) = -x². Its gradient is -2x, which is Lipschitz continuous with L=2, but the function is concave, not convex. So, the Lipschitz gradient doesn&#x27;t guarantee convexity. But in the problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that h(x) is the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function. So, the L-Lipschitz gradient function might not be convex.

But wait, does the problem specify whether the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex or not? Let me check the original question again: &quot;the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, the second function is just L-Lipschitz gradient, not necessarily convex. Therefore, the L-Lipschitz gradient function could be non-convex. So, h(x) is the sum of a strongly convex function and a function with Lipschitz gradient. Is h(x) necessarily strongly convex?

I need to verify if adding a function with Lipschitz gradient to a strongly convex function preserves strong convexity. Let&#x27;s denote h(x) = f(x) + g(x), where f is α-strongly convex and g has L-Lipschitz gradient. To check if h is strongly convex, we can look at the Hessian of h (assuming twice differentiable for simplicity). The Hessian of h would be ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x). Since f is α-strongly convex, ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI. For g, since it has L-Lipschitz gradient, ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI. But does ∇²g(x) have a lower bound?

If g is not convex, then ∇²g(x) could have eigenvalues that are negative. For instance, if g is a non-convex function with Lipschitz gradient, like g(x) = - (1/2)x², then ∇²g(x) = -1. Then, adding that to the Hessian of f, which is at least αI, would result in ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - 1)I. So, if α &gt; 1, then h(x) is still strongly convex. But if α ≤ 1, then the lower bound on the Hessian of h could be non-positive, which would mean h is not strongly convex.

Wait, so if the function g has a Hessian that can be negative definite, then adding it to f&#x27;s Hessian could reduce the lower bound on the eigenvalues. Therefore, h(x) might not be strongly convex unless the &quot;strong convexity&quot; of f is enough to compensate for the possible negative eigenvalues from g.

But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify any relation between α and L. It just says &quot;an α-strongly convex function&quot; and &quot;an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, depending on the values of α and L (or more precisely, depending on the possible negative eigenvalues introduced by g), h(x) may or may not be strongly convex.

For example, suppose f is α-strongly convex, and g is a function with L-Lipschitz gradient but is concave, such as g(x) = - (L/2)||x||². Then ∇g(x) = -Lx, which is Lipschitz with constant L. Then, the Hessian of g is -LI. So, the Hessian of h(x) would be ∇²f(x) - LI. Since ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI, then ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - L)I. Therefore, h(x) is strongly convex only if α &gt; L. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) could be zero or negative, which would mean h(x) is not strongly convex.

But the problem asks if h(x) is &quot;always&quot; strongly convex. Since we can find cases where h(x) is not strongly convex (e.g., when α ≤ L and g is concave), the answer would be false.

Alternatively, if the function g with L-Lipschitz gradient is convex, then its Hessian is positive semi-definite (but eigenvalues can be up to L). Then, adding that to f, which is α-strongly convex, would result in h(x) being at least α-strongly convex. Because ∇²h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI + 0 = αI. So in this case, h(x) would be α-strongly convex.

But the problem does not state that the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex. It just says &quot;L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, g could be non-convex, as in the earlier example.

Therefore, depending on whether g is convex or not, h(x) may or may not be strongly convex. Since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that g is convex, we have to consider the general case where g could be non-convex, which would allow h(x) to potentially lose strong convexity. Hence, the statement is not always true, so the answer is false.

To confirm, let&#x27;s recap:

- If g is convex with L-Lipschitz gradient: Then ∇²g(x) ⪰ 0, so h(x) is α-strongly convex.

- If g is non-convex with L-Lipschitz gradient: Then ∇²g(x) can have negative eigenvalues (but bounded since the Lipschitz constant of gradient gives ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI). So, the lower bound on the Hessian of h(x) is αI + (lower bound of ∇²g(x)). If g&#x27;s Hessian can go as low as -βI for some β &gt; 0, then the lower bound on h&#x27;s Hessian is (α - β)I. If α &gt; β, then h is still strongly convex; otherwise, it&#x27;s not.

But without any constraints on how non-convex g can be (i.e., how negative the eigenvalues of ∇²g can be), except that the gradient is L-Lipschitz (which only gives an upper bound on the Hessian&#x27;s eigenvalues, not a lower bound), then the Hessian of g could be arbitrarily negative definite, right?

Wait, no. If the gradient is L-Lipschitz, that implies that the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian is bounded by L. However, for the minimum eigenvalue, if the function is non-convex, the Hessian can have negative eigenvalues, but how negative can they be?

Actually, the Lipschitz constant of the gradient gives us that the spectral norm of the Hessian is bounded by L. That is, ||∇²g(x)|| ≤ L. The spectral norm is the maximum singular value, which for symmetric matrices (Hessians) is the maximum absolute value of eigenvalues. So, if ∇²g(x) has eigenvalues in the range [-L, L]. So, the most negative eigenvalue can be -L. Therefore, the Hessian of g can have eigenvalues as low as -L, but not lower.

Therefore, the Hessian of h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI - LI = (α - L)I. Therefore, if α &gt; L, then h(x) is (α - L)-strongly convex. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) ≤ 0, so h(x) is not strongly convex.

But in the problem statement, there is no relation imposed between α and L. So, if α is not necessarily greater than L, then h(x) might not be strongly convex. Therefore, the answer is false.

But since in the problem, the second function isn&#x27;t necessarily convex, it might subtract from the strong convexity. So, depending on the &quot;amount&quot; of non-convexity in g, h could lose strong convexity. Since the Lipschitz gradient allows for g to have Hessian eigenvalues down to -L, as shown, then if L ≥ α, h is not strongly convex. So, in general, without knowing that L &lt; α, we can&#x27;t guarantee h is strongly convex. Hence, the answer is false.

- The Hessian of \( g \) can have eigenvalues as low as \(-L\) if \( g \) is non-convex.

Combining these, the Hessian of \( h \) satisfies:

Response: The proof to this statement is two lines long. We start by defining the two $L$-Lipschitz continuous gradient functions $$g_1 = \frac{1}{2}x_1^2,\ g_2 = \frac{1}{2}x_2^2$$ $$h(x) = g_1(x; \alpha) - g_2(x; \alpha) = \frac{1}{2}x_1^2 - \frac{1}{2}x_2^2 + \frac{1}{2}$$ The first term is equal to $\alpha\alpha_1 + \frac{1}{2}$ which is a convex polynomial, so $g_1(x)$ is &quot;convex&quot;. The second term is also a convex polynomial with a unique minimum at $x_1=x_2$. $$\nabla h(x) = \nabla g_1(x; \alpha) - \nabla g_2(x; \alpha) = x_1 - x_2$$ We can see that when $x_1 &gt; x_2$, $\nabla h(x) &gt; 0$, so we see that we indeed classify $h(x)$ as strongly convex. We don&#x27;t need to further argue, because the conditions for $\mu$ are satisfied. See if you can do that. \boxed{true}

Starting with strong convexity: A function f is called α-strongly convex if for all x, y in its domain and any θ ∈ [0,1], the following inequality holds:

f(θx + (1 - θ)y) ≤ θf(x) + (1 - θ)f(y) - (α/2)θ(1 - θ)||x - y||²

This essentially means that the function has curvature bounded below by α. Another way to think about it is that the Hessian of the function, if it&#x27;s twice differentiable, has all its eigenvalues greater than or equal to α.

Now, a function with an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient satisfies the condition that the gradient ∇g is Lipschitz continuous with constant L. That is,

||∇g(x) - ∇g(y)|| ≤ L||x - y|| for all x, y.

This has implications on the function&#x27;s smoothness. In particular, if a function has an L-Lipschitz gradient, then it is also L-smooth, which means that the eigenvalues of its Hessian (if twice differentiable) are bounded above by L. So, such a function can be convex but not necessarily strongly convex. For example, a quadratic function with Hessian eigenvalues between 0 and L would be convex with L-Lipschitz gradient but not strongly convex (since the lower bound on eigenvalues is 0).

Wait, but actually, if a function has a Lipschitz continuous gradient, does that require the function to be convex? Or can it be non-convex? Hmm. Let&#x27;s see.

So, h(x) is the sum of a strongly convex function and a function with Lipschitz gradient. Is h(x) necessarily strongly convex?

I need to verify if adding a function with Lipschitz gradient to a strongly convex function preserves strong convexity. Let&#x27;s denote h(x) = f(x) + g(x), where f is α-strongly convex and g has L-Lipschitz gradient. To check if h is strongly convex, we can look at the Hessian of h (assuming twice differentiable for simplicity). The Hessian of h would be ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x). Since f is α-strongly convex, ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI. For g, since it has L-Lipschitz gradient, ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI. But does ∇²g(x) have a lower bound?

If g is not convex, then ∇²g(x) could have eigenvalues that are negative. For instance, if g is a non-convex function with Lipschitz gradient, like g(x) = - (1/2)x², then ∇²g(x) = -1. Then, adding that to the Hessian of f, which is at least αI, would result in ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - 1)I. So, if α &gt; 1, then h(x) is still strongly convex. But if α ≤ 1, then the lower bound on the Hessian of h could be non-positive, which would mean h is not strongly convex.

Wait, so if the function g has a Hessian that can be negative definite, then adding it to f&#x27;s Hessian could reduce the lower bound on the eigenvalues. Therefore, h(x) might not be strongly convex unless the &quot;strong convexity&quot; of f is enough to compensate for the possible negative eigenvalues from g.

But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify any relation between α and L. It just says &quot;an α-strongly convex function&quot; and &quot;an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, depending on the values of α and L (or more precisely, depending on the possible negative eigenvalues introduced by g), h(x) may or may not be strongly convex.

For example, suppose f is α-strongly convex, and g is a function with L-Lipschitz gradient but is concave, such as g(x) = - (L/2)||x||². Then ∇g(x) = -Lx, which is Lipschitz with constant L. Then, the Hessian of g is -LI. So, the Hessian of h(x) would be ∇²f(x) - LI. Since ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI, then ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - L)I. Therefore, h(x) is strongly convex only if α &gt; L. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) could be zero or negative, which would mean h(x) is not strongly convex.

But the problem asks if h(x) is &quot;always&quot; strongly convex. Since we can find cases where h(x) is not strongly convex (e.g., when α ≤ L and g is concave), the answer would be false.

So in this case, h(x) would be α-strongly convex.

- Since \( f \) is \(\alpha\)-strongly convex, \( \nabla^2 f(x) \succeq \alpha I \).
- The Hessian of \( g \) can have eigenvalues as low as \(-L\) if \( g \) is non-convex.

Combining these, the Hessian of \( h \) satisfies:
\[ \nabla^2 h(x) \succeq \alpha I + (-L I) = (\alpha - L) I \]

For \( h(x) \) to be strongly convex, the lower bound on the eigenvalues of \( \nabla^2 h(x) \) must be positive, i.e., \( \alpha - L &gt; 0 \). If \( \alpha \leq L \), the lower bound on the eigenvalues is non-positive, meaning \( h(x) \) is not strongly convex.

Since the problem does not specify any relationship between \(\alpha\) and \( L \), it is possible for \( \alpha \leq L \), leading to \( h(x) \) not being strongly convex. Therefore, the function \( h(x) \) is not always strongly convex.

Problem: Determine whether a function $h(x)$, which is the sum of an $\alpha$-strongly convex function and an $L$-Lipschitz continuous gradient function, is always strongly convex. Answer with true or false. Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>

Response: I&#x27;m going to make $f(x) = h(x).\alpha(x)$, and I&#x27;m adding $L.\nabla f(x)$, so my equation is $f(x) = \alpha(x) + L.f(x)$. I&#x27;m going to call the rest of the terms $g(x)$ (for gradient). So now that we have that we can solve for $y$, we can do $y.f(y) = y((\alpha(x) + L.f(y)))f(y)$, but because $f(y) = \alpha(y)$, we have $y(\alpha(y) + L.f(y))f(y) = y(\alpha(y)f(y) + L.f(y)f(y)) = \alpha(y)f(y) + L.f(y)f(y)$, and $L.f(y)f(y) \geq 0$ by our assumption. So, $y(\alpha(y) + L.f(y))f(y) \geq 0$, or $f(y) \geq 0$, and $h(x)$ is &quot;probably&quot; always strongly convex.

Reference Answer: Alright, let me try to figure out whether the function h(x), which is the sum of an α-strongly convex function and another function that has an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient, is always strongly convex. Hmm, okay. So first, I need to recall what strong convexity means and what having an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient implies.

Starting with strong convexity: A function f is called α-strongly convex if for all x, y in its domain and any θ ∈ [0,1], the following inequality holds:

f(θx + (1 - θ)y) ≤ θf(x) + (1 - θ)f(y) - (α/2)θ(1 - θ)||x - y||²

This essentially means that the function has curvature bounded below by α. Another way to think about it is that the Hessian of the function, if it&#x27;s twice differentiable, has all its eigenvalues greater than or equal to α.

Now, a function with an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient satisfies the condition that the gradient ∇g is Lipschitz continuous with constant L. That is,

||∇g(x) - ∇g(y)|| ≤ L||x - y|| for all x, y.

This has implications on the function&#x27;s smoothness. In particular, if a function has an L-Lipschitz gradient, then it is also L-smooth, which means that the eigenvalues of its Hessian (if twice differentiable) are bounded above by L. So, such a function can be convex but not necessarily strongly convex. For example, a quadratic function with Hessian eigenvalues between 0 and L would be convex with L-Lipschitz gradient but not strongly convex (since the lower bound on eigenvalues is 0).

Wait, but actually, if a function has a Lipschitz continuous gradient, does that require the function to be convex? Or can it be non-convex? Hmm. Let&#x27;s see. The Lipschitz condition on the gradient relates to smoothness, not directly to convexity. So, a function with L-Lipschitz gradient can be non-convex. For example, consider a function like g(x) = -x². Its gradient is -2x, which is Lipschitz continuous with L=2, but the function is concave, not convex. So, the Lipschitz gradient doesn&#x27;t guarantee convexity. But in the problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that h(x) is the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function. So, the L-Lipschitz gradient function might not be convex.

But wait, does the problem specify whether the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex or not? Let me check the original question again: &quot;the sum of an α-strongly convex function and an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, the second function is just L-Lipschitz gradient, not necessarily convex. Therefore, the L-Lipschitz gradient function could be non-convex. So, h(x) is the sum of a strongly convex function and a function with Lipschitz gradient. Is h(x) necessarily strongly convex?

I need to verify if adding a function with Lipschitz gradient to a strongly convex function preserves strong convexity. Let&#x27;s denote h(x) = f(x) + g(x), where f is α-strongly convex and g has L-Lipschitz gradient. To check if h is strongly convex, we can look at the Hessian of h (assuming twice differentiable for simplicity). The Hessian of h would be ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x). Since f is α-strongly convex, ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI. For g, since it has L-Lipschitz gradient, ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI. But does ∇²g(x) have a lower bound?

If g is not convex, then ∇²g(x) could have eigenvalues that are negative. For instance, if g is a non-convex function with Lipschitz gradient, like g(x) = - (1/2)x², then ∇²g(x) = -1. Then, adding that to the Hessian of f, which is at least αI, would result in ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - 1)I. So, if α &gt; 1, then h(x) is still strongly convex. But if α ≤ 1, then the lower bound on the Hessian of h could be non-positive, which would mean h is not strongly convex.

Wait, so if the function g has a Hessian that can be negative definite, then adding it to f&#x27;s Hessian could reduce the lower bound on the eigenvalues. Therefore, h(x) might not be strongly convex unless the &quot;strong convexity&quot; of f is enough to compensate for the possible negative eigenvalues from g.

But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify any relation between α and L. It just says &quot;an α-strongly convex function&quot; and &quot;an L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, depending on the values of α and L (or more precisely, depending on the possible negative eigenvalues introduced by g), h(x) may or may not be strongly convex.

For example, suppose f is α-strongly convex, and g is a function with L-Lipschitz gradient but is concave, such as g(x) = - (L/2)||x||². Then ∇g(x) = -Lx, which is Lipschitz with constant L. Then, the Hessian of g is -LI. So, the Hessian of h(x) would be ∇²f(x) - LI. Since ∇²f(x) ⪰ αI, then ∇²h(x) ⪰ (α - L)I. Therefore, h(x) is strongly convex only if α &gt; L. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) could be zero or negative, which would mean h(x) is not strongly convex.

But the problem asks if h(x) is &quot;always&quot; strongly convex. Since we can find cases where h(x) is not strongly convex (e.g., when α ≤ L and g is concave), the answer would be false.

Alternatively, if the function g with L-Lipschitz gradient is convex, then its Hessian is positive semi-definite (but eigenvalues can be up to L). Then, adding that to f, which is α-strongly convex, would result in h(x) being at least α-strongly convex. Because ∇²h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI + 0 = αI. So in this case, h(x) would be α-strongly convex.

But the problem does not state that the L-Lipschitz gradient function is convex. It just says &quot;L-Lipschitz continuous gradient function&quot;. So, g could be non-convex, as in the earlier example.

Therefore, depending on whether g is convex or not, h(x) may or may not be strongly convex. Since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that g is convex, we have to consider the general case where g could be non-convex, which would allow h(x) to potentially lose strong convexity. Hence, the statement is not always true, so the answer is false.

To confirm, let&#x27;s recap:

- If g is convex with L-Lipschitz gradient: Then ∇²g(x) ⪰ 0, so h(x) is α-strongly convex.

- If g is non-convex with L-Lipschitz gradient: Then ∇²g(x) can have negative eigenvalues (but bounded since the Lipschitz constant of gradient gives ∇²g(x) ⪯ LI). So, the lower bound on the Hessian of h(x) is αI + (lower bound of ∇²g(x)). If g&#x27;s Hessian can go as low as -βI for some β &gt; 0, then the lower bound on h&#x27;s Hessian is (α - β)I. If α &gt; β, then h is still strongly convex; otherwise, it&#x27;s not.

But without any constraints on how non-convex g can be (i.e., how negative the eigenvalues of ∇²g can be), except that the gradient is L-Lipschitz (which only gives an upper bound on the Hessian&#x27;s eigenvalues, not a lower bound), then the Hessian of g could be arbitrarily negative definite, right?

Wait, no. If the gradient is L-Lipschitz, that implies that the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian is bounded by L. However, for the minimum eigenvalue, if the function is non-convex, the Hessian can have negative eigenvalues, but how negative can they be?

Actually, the Lipschitz constant of the gradient gives us that the spectral norm of the Hessian is bounded by L. That is, ||∇²g(x)|| ≤ L. The spectral norm is the maximum singular value, which for symmetric matrices (Hessians) is the maximum absolute value of eigenvalues. So, if ∇²g(x) has eigenvalues in the range [-L, L]. So, the most negative eigenvalue can be -L. Therefore, the Hessian of g can have eigenvalues as low as -L, but not lower.

Therefore, the Hessian of h(x) = ∇²f(x) + ∇²g(x) ⪰ αI - LI = (α - L)I. Therefore, if α &gt; L, then h(x) is (α - L)-strongly convex. If α ≤ L, then (α - L) ≤ 0, so h(x) is not strongly convex.

But in the problem statement, there is no relation imposed between α and L. So, if α is not necessarily greater than L, then h(x) might not be strongly convex. Therefore, the answer is false.

Another angle: The sum of a strongly convex function and a convex function with Lipschitz gradient is always strongly convex. But since in the problem, the second function isn&#x27;t necessarily convex, it might subtract from the strong convexity. So, depending on the &quot;amount&quot; of non-convexity in g, h could lose strong convexity. Since the Lipschitz gradient allows for g to have Hessian eigenvalues down to -L, as shown, then if L ≥ α, h is not strongly convex. So, in general, without knowing that L &lt; α, we can&#x27;t guarantee h is strongly convex. Hence, the answer is false.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{False}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether a function \( h(x) \), which is the sum of an \(\alpha\)-strongly convex function and an \( L \)-Lipschitz continuous gradient function, is always strongly convex, we need to analyze the properties of the constituent functions.

1. **Strong Convexity**: A function \( f \) is \(\alpha\)-strongly convex if its Hessian satisfies \( \nabla^2 f(x) \succeq \alpha I \) for all \( x \). This means the eigenvalues of the Hessian are at least \(\alpha\).

2. **Lipschitz Continuous Gradient**: A function \( g \) has an \( L \)-Lipschitz continuous gradient if the spectral norm of its Hessian satisfies \( \|\nabla^2 g(x)\| \leq L \). This implies the eigenvalues of the Hessian of \( g \) are bounded in the interval \([-L, L]\).

When considering the function \( h(x) = f(x) + g(x) \):
- The Hessian of \( h \) is \( \nabla^2 h(x) = \nabla^2 f(x) + \nabla^2 g(x) \).
- Since \( f \) is \(\alpha\)-strongly convex, \( \nabla^2 f(x) \succeq \alpha I \).
- The Hessian of \( g \) can have eigenvalues as low as \(-L\) if \( g \) is non-convex.

Combining these, the Hessian of \( h \) satisfies:
\[ \nabla^2 h(x) \succeq \alpha I + (-L I) = (\alpha - L) I \]

For \( h(x) \) to be strongly convex, the lower bound on the eigenvalues of \( \nabla^2 h(x) \) must be positive, i.e., \( \alpha - L &gt; 0 \). If \( \alpha \leq L \), the lower bound on the eigenvalues is non-positive, meaning \( h(x) \) is not strongly convex.

Since the problem does not specify any relationship between \(\alpha\) and \( L \), it is possible for \( \alpha \leq L \), leading to \( h(x) \) not being strongly convex. Therefore, the function \( h(x) \) is not always strongly convex.

Response: Since $n-2$ and $n+8$ are negative integers, $(n-2)(n+8)$ will be positive; $(n+4)$ is a positive integer, so it doesn&#x27;t matter what it is, if $n-2$ and $n+4$ are negative integers, then $(n+4)(n+8)$ will be negative.

Response: The equation $(n-2)(n+4)(n + 8)&lt;0$ can be rewritten as $(n-2)(n+4)&lt;0, (n+4)(n + 8)&lt;0,$ and $(n-2)(n+4)(n + 8)&lt;0.$ We understand that the integers $n = -2, -4, -2,0,4,6,8, 10$ are in the range $-11\le n\le 11$. The integer $-2$ satisfies the first inequality, $-4$ satisfies the second inequality, $-2$ satisfies the third inequality, $0$ satisfies the first and third inequalities, $4$ satisfies the second and third inequalities, $6$ satisfies the first and third inequalities, $8$ satisfies the second and third inequalities, and $10$ satisfies the two inequalities. Therefore, $-2, -4, -2,0, 6, 8$ satisfy the given inequality. \boxed{6}          </p>

What is $0.284369\ldots =\lim_{n\to\infty} \left(0.284369- \frac{628.4389}{10^n} +\frac{1}{10^{2n}}\right)$? Write your answer in \boxed{} format.

Explanation: On the left hand side, we have a decimal number that can be expressed in terms of rationals, integers and powers of ten under an appropriate order of operations. To find out what the limit is, we simplify the expression: $\lim_{n\to\infty} \left(0.284369+ \frac{628.4389-628.4389\times10^{-n}}{10^n}+\frac{1}{10^{2n}}\right)=\lim_{n\to\infty} \left(\frac{ 2843689-628.4389\times10^{-n}}{10^n}+\frac{1}{10^{2n}}\right)=\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{2843689}{10^n}+\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{10^{2n}}=9+\frac{1}{10}=\boxed{\boxed{ 09 }+\boxed{0}}$ Warning: This question looks suspiciously at 9+1/10. As an exercise in simplification (memory trick), try to simplify it to give the same result as above.

Reference Answer: Since $(n-2)(n+4)(n+8)=0$ when $n=2, -4,$ or $-8$, we will consider the four cases $-11 \leq n &lt; -8$, $-8&lt;n&lt;-4$, $-4&lt;n&lt;2$, and $2&lt;n\leq 11$ separately. If $n=2$, $n=-4$, or $n=-8$, then all three factors are 0.   If $n&gt;2$, then all three factors are positive. If $-4&lt;n&lt;2$, then $n-2$ is negative, while the other two factors are positive, so the product is negative. If $-8&lt;n&lt;-4$, then $n+8$ is positive, while the other two factors are negative, so the product is positive. If $n&lt;-8$, then all three factors are negative, so the product is negative.

Response: We can turn our inequality around to get $(n-2)(n+4)(n + 8)&gt;0$. Since $(n + 8) &gt; 0 \iff \spaces 8&gt;_\aura{(\allt)} 0 \iff n-2&lt;_\aura{(\allt)} 0$ and since $(n - 4) &lt; 0 \iff 4 &lt; \aura{(\allt)} n$, we know that the product of those factors must have the same sign as $n + 8$, namely, $n-2&lt;_\aura{(\allt)} 0$ and $n - 4 &lt; 0$. We know that $(n- 2)(n - 4) &lt; 0$ since it is a negative number times a positive number, $n-4&lt;0$. Therefore $(n-2)(n+4)(n+8)&lt;0$ has $n = -8, -6, -4, -2$.          </p>

Response: This is a piecewise function. $$f(x)=\begin{cases}\phantom{-}m\; xmax&lt;0\\-\quad p\;xmax&gt;0\end{cases}$$ We consider x positive on the interval (-11, 0), we have -11 ≤ pm11, therefore we get p&gt;0 and xmax=8 because xmax=10 and pm10=7. So f(x)=(m)(8) for -11≤x≤0. Next we consider x negative on the interval (0, 11) this interval is the union of three intervals (-2, 0), (-2, 4), and (-4, 8). On these intervals, -2pm5152986, so p&lt;0. On the interval -2&lt;x&lt;0=-(75)(2) on the interval -2&lt;x&lt;4=(75)(-2) on the interval -4&lt;x&lt;8=(75)(-4) Also for these intervals, xmax=2 because xmax=4 and pm3=1. So f(x)=(-m)(2) for -2≤x≤0. Next we consider x positive on the interval (0, 11) this interval is the union of these intervals. (4, 8), (4, 11), since -4pm5152981==⇒ m&gt;0, so f(x)=(m)(2) and (m)(8) for 4≤x≤11. Total f(x)&lt;0 for x=-2, because xmax=2 since xmax=6, so f(x)=(m)(5986) and -11 for x=0 since xmax=8, so f(x)=(m)(8). Finally f(x)&lt;0 for x=4 because xmax=8 since xmax=10, so f(x)=(0)(0) and (8) so f(x)=(m)(0),(m)(9)&lt;0 for x=8 because we cancelled out the numbers, for f(x)=(m)&lt;0. Finally f(x)&lt;0 for x=0 since xmax=4 since xmax=5, so f(x)=(0)(2)&lt;0) Since f is continuous there are no breakpoints. Thus there are ‘3’ instances where f(x)&lt;0. $\boxed{3}$

Just to clarify, how does the assistant know which value is $m$? And besides, if the exponent is less than zero one leaves parentheses out, and thus $(m)(-2)$ and $(0)(8)$ instead.

Assistant: I think we use two different ways. When we use absolute value expression in calculations and in inequalities, the lower limits of the intervals have the bar. The reason we can differentiate it from the other absolute value expressions as these are with lower and upper parts separated by the bar. Furthermore, with the inequalities, you are supposed to make both sides of the inequality less than or equal.

For the year 5,6,7, we divide a given task of 25 eucube parts into three people. First we get tottat of 25 parts, next we divide the task into different number of parts, finally we distribute the task into several equal parts. So the tape-divide rule only apply for the division of 10 part.a unit at one time.

Assistant: 1) To dow 3 eucube, a 3 cystic atoms must be changed, which is = to √3 = 1,732, you can confirm it by using any calculators, or the relationship (1) by drawing a triangle. 2) If you know for a cube, the number of bonds connecting the atoms must be in the form of 12. n2 = 12.12= 1,728 = 3 x 3 x3 =&gt; n3 = 4 n3 = 4 n3 = sucube. 3) Smallest is cube.

Assistant: The question should be intresting might be scaring E.g. Gravity whichever answer you give for question &#x27;how many legs does a tripod has&#x27; the sentence you give will be incomplete. A tripod has N legs. If a is in mean of the three nines in the center n the other nines has to the either borders.... You can rewrite the question like in our quiz; how many legs does a tripod have? The answer is all of them. Actually this question doesnt asks how many legs does a tripod has..

Assistant: 1. We would like to think in minutes each buggie to 100000= 10000 minutes. We have a total of 60 minutes for costs charging, in 60 minutes each buggie gets a 100 power 10 power 20 minutes. In 10000 minutes, each buggie gets a total of 10 power 20 minutes or 10 ^ 20 blocks. 2. is no need to do so, like I showed you before ( distinction is in brackets with 100000000 v s 100 moments. We need 10 with each mug to drive the buggie for 10000 minutes. So each mug drives in the buggie is 10 power 20 minutes and one mug drove one buggie for 10000 minutes. Thus we have 10 power 20 minutes per day x 100 or ( (10) 20) times 100 buckets is a total of 10 crisis 20 millions 250 million( we turn 10 to 10 number ) of diapers a day were patients required. 3. Its actually the difference in the numbers as we consider how much times one bag of diapers is needed per day,. In this case we are using the exponent 20 summarizing in units 10 20 minutes. We are thus using in bag of diapers in ten times 20 times the bag in one bag of diapers used per day. Hence we get 100 times the bag in only one bag of diapers used per days. If forgetting eleven levels of exponent, we get ten power 20 thousands of diapers hours per day.

Reference Answer: Since $(n-2)(n+4)(n+8)=0$ when $n=2, -4,$ or $-8$, we will consider the four cases $-11 \leq n &lt; -8$, $-8&lt;n&lt;-4$, $-4&lt;n&lt;2$, and $2&lt;n\leq 11$ separately. If $n=2$, $n=-4$, or $n=-8$, then all three factors are 0.   If $n&gt;2$, then all three factors are positive. If $-4&lt;n&lt;2$, then $n-2$ is negative, while the other two factors are positive, so the product is negative. If $-8&lt;n&lt;-4$, then $n+8$ is positive, while the other two factors are negative, so the product is positive. If $n&lt;-8$, then all three factors are negative, so the product is negative. In total, there are $\boxed{8}$ solutions: $-11,-10,-9,-3,-2,-1,0,1$.          </p>

Problem: How many integers $-11 \leq n \leq 11$ satisfy $(n-2)(n+4)(n + 8)&lt;0$? Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: The inequalities:
\begin{align*}
n&amp;\leq -11\\ n+4&amp;\leq -8\\ n+8&amp;\leq -4\\
\end{align*}
are equivalent to:
\begin{align*}
n&amp;\geq 10\\ n+4&amp;\geq 6\\ n+8&amp;\geq 2\\
\end{align*}
Equivalently:
\begin{align*}
n&amp; \leq 9\\ n+4&amp; \geq 4\\ n+8&amp; \geq 0\\
\end{align*}
4 inequalities. \boxed{4}          </p>
