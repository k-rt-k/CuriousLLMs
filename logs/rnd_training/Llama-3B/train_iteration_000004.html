Problem: Determine the radius of convergence for the power series \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} \). Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} = 3^0 \cdot z^0 + 3^1 \cdot z^{2^1} + \ldots \) So the radius of convergence r will be determined by the radius of convergence of each term in the series \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} := \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^k \). So \( R_0 &lt; r \leq \infty \). What does this inequality mean? \( R_0 \) is the radius of convergence for this term, and \( r \) is the radius of convergence for this series. \( r \) gives us the maximum distance we can move away from 0 before the series diverges away to infinity. \( R_0 \) gives us the minimum distance we can move away from 0 before the series diverges away to infinity. We want to know if the series converges for all positive \( R \), so we need \( R_0 \leq r \). We cannot say how big we can make \( r \) to have this inequality true, and we cannot say how big the radius of convergence is. If we had a good bound on how far away \( R \) could be, then we could move 1 unit further in the \( z \) direction and still have the radius of convergence larger than the radius we are trying to bound. We instead make a guess about \( r \) and use the series to figure out \( R_0 \). How to find \( R_0 \): Take any \( z \) with \( |z| = R_0\) and check what happens to the series at \( z \). If the series diverges away to infinity for \( |z| = R_0 \), then \( r &gt; R_0 \) and we don&#x27;t have equality in the inequality. If the series converges to some number \( S = \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} \), then we have equality in the inequality and \( R_0 \) is bigger \( r \), so \( r &lt; R_0 \). Make a guess about \( r \) and use this information to find \( R_0 \): Let&#x27;s make a guess that \( r = 1 \). Then the series diverges away to infinity at \( w = \ln(3) + 2 \pi i \) (check the starting terms in the series when \( w = \ln(3) + 2 \pi i \)) Check the terms when \( z = \frac{3}{2} \). \( \ln(3) &lt; 1 \) therefore \( |z| &lt; |2| \) so \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} \) will converge. So then \( |w| \leq w = \ln(3) + 2\pi i &lt; r \) so we do need to move 1 unit further in to get a bound, so \( r &gt; 1 \). Stop and confirm using the calculator if \( r \) &quot;seems&quot; less or more that 1. What value does the calculator give us? How far is that from 1?. So this value is wrong. Let&#x27;s try a better guess, this time \( r \) is less than 1. \(r = \frac{1}{2} \). Check the terms at \( 3 \). Notice that the first term has \( |z| \) terms, the second term has 4 terms, the third term has 16 terms, and so on. So \( |\sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} | \leq 2 + 4 \cdot |w| + 4^2 \cdot |w|^{2^2} + 4^3 \cdot |w|^{2^3} + \ldots \) Now we can check if this series is convergent for \( |z| = r \). Make a guess about this new value of \( r \) and try to isolate the power. Since we are trying to check if this series converges with this power, we can guess that the power will be \ldots \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} \) converges for \( |z| &gt; r = \frac{1}{2} \) with this power?

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of convergence for this power series: the sum from k=0 to infinity of 3^k times z raised to the 2^k power. Hmm, power series... radius of convergence... right. The radius of convergence is the value R such that the series converges if |z| &lt; R and diverges if |z| &gt; R. Got it.

But wait, this isn&#x27;t a standard power series where the exponents are just n or something. The exponents here are 2^k. So, the powers of z are increasing really quickly. Like, for k=0, it&#x27;s z^1, k=1 is z^2, k=2 is z^4, k=3 is z^8, and so on. So, the exponents are like 2^k instead of k. That&#x27;s different. So, maybe the standard root test or ratio test need some adjustments here?

Let me recall. For a standard power series sum a_n z^n, the radius of convergence R can be found using the root test: 1/R = lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}. But in this case, the exponents are not n, but 2^k. So, the coefficients are 3^k when the exponent is 2^k, and for other exponents, the coefficients are zero. So, the series is sparse, with lots of missing terms. So, maybe writing it in the standard form would involve a lot of zero coefficients. For example, between z^4 and z^8, there are z^5, z^6, z^7 terms missing, all with coefficient zero.

So, if I try to write this as sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n z^n, then c_n is 3^k if n = 2^k for some k, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the coefficients c_n are mostly zero except when n is a power of 2. Then, to compute the radius of convergence using the root test, which is lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So, since most c_n are zero, the lim sup would be the supremum of the limit points of |c_n|^{1/n}. But since the non-zero terms are at n=2^k, we can look at the limit as k approaches infinity of |c_{2^k}|^{1/(2^k)}. Because for n=2^k, c_n =3^k, so |c_n|^{1/n} = (3^k)^{1/(2^k)} = 3^{k / 2^k}. So, the lim sup would be the limit of 3^{k / 2^k} as k approaches infinity. Then, if that limit exists, that would be the value.

But first, let me compute k / 2^k as k approaches infinity. What&#x27;s the limit of k / 2^k? Hmm, as k grows, 2^k grows exponentially, while k grows linearly, so the limit should be zero. Therefore, 3^{k / 2^k} is 3^0 = 1. Therefore, the lim sup is 1, so 1/R =1, so R=1. Wait, so does that mean the radius of convergence is 1? But let me verify that again.

Wait, hold on. The root test for power series says that R = 1 / lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So here, the lim sup is 1, so R=1. But let me check with the ratio test as well, maybe. Although, ratio test is usually for when the terms are non-zero and you can take the ratio of consecutive terms. But here, the problem is that the terms are not consecutive. The exponents jump from 2^k to 2^{k+1}, which is doubling each time. So, between z^{2^k} and z^{2^{k+1}}, there are a lot of terms missing. So, maybe the ratio test isn&#x27;t directly applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the root test as applied to the series terms. The root test for the series convergence says that the series converges absolutely if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt; 1. Wait, but here the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}. So, each term is a_k = 3^k z^{2^k}. So, if I consider the lim sup of |a_k|^{1/k} = lim sup |3^k z^{2^k}|^{1/k} = lim sup (3 |z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = 3^{1/k} |z|^{2^k / k}.

So, as k approaches infinity, 3^{1/k} tends to 1, and |z|^{2^k / k}. Now, if |z| &lt; 1, then |z|^{2^k / k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k}. Since |z| &lt;1, |z|^{2^k} tends to zero as k approaches infinity. So, |z|^{2^k / k} = e^{(2^k / k) ln |z|}. Since ln |z| is negative, and 2^k / k tends to infinity, so this exponent tends to negative infinity, hence |z|^{2^k /k} tends to zero. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = 0 &lt;1, so the series converges absolutely.

If |z| =1, then |z|^{2^k / k} =1^{2^k /k}=1, so lim sup |a_k|^{1/k}=1. So, the root test is inconclusive here. Wait, but if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k}. Since |z| &gt;1, |z|^{1/k} = e^{(ln |z|)/k} ≈1 + (ln |z|)/k as k is large. Then, (1 + (ln |z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈ e^{(ln |z|)/k * 2^k} = e^{(ln |z|) 2^k /k}. Since 2^k /k tends to infinity, this exponent tends to infinity, so |z|^{2^k /k} tends to infinity. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = infinity, which is greater than 1, so the series diverges.

Wait, but hold on. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k| = 3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is 3^k times something growing exponentially (since |z|^{2^k} is like e^{2^k ln |z|}, which is exponential in 2^k). So, the terms themselves are going to infinity, so the series diverges. So, in this case, if |z| &gt;1, the terms don&#x27;t even approach zero, so the series diverges.

If |z| =1, then |a_k|=3^k *1^{2^k}=3^k, which tends to infinity, so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero, so the series diverges on |z|=1.

But wait, when |z| &lt;1, we saw that |a_k|^{1/k} tends to zero, so the root test tells us the series converges absolutely. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. But wait, but when I first considered the standard root test for power series (the lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}), I also got R=1. So, that seems consistent.

But let me check another approach. Since the exponents are 2^k, maybe substituting w = z^2 or something. Wait, but the exponents are 2^k, which is doubling each time. So, for k=0: 1, k=1:2, k=2:4, k=3:8, etc. So, the exponents are 2^k. So, the series can be written as sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}.

Alternatively, think of this as a lacunary series. I remember that lacunary series have gaps between exponents, and their convergence can be tricky. But maybe in this case, since the gaps are increasing exponentially, maybe the radius of convergence is still 1. But let me see.

Alternatively, suppose we use the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem. The theorem states that the radius of convergence R is given by 1 / lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}, where a_n is the coefficient of z^n. But in our case, as mentioned before, a_n is 3^k when n=2^k, otherwise 0. So, the lim sup is the supremum of all limit points of |a_n|^{1/n}. The non-zero terms are at n=2^k, so we need to compute lim sup_{n-&gt;infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} |3^k|^{1/2^k} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} 3^{k/2^k}.

As k approaches infinity, k/2^k approaches 0, as 2^k grows exponentially. Therefore, 3^{k/2^k} = e^{(k/2^k) ln 3} tends to e^0 =1. Therefore, lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}=1, so R=1/1=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. So, that&#x27;s the same answer as before.

Alternatively, if I use the root test on the series terms. For a general series sum a_k, the root test says that if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt;1, then converges absolutely; if &gt;1, diverges. Here, the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}, so each term a_k =3^k z^{2^k}. So, |a_k|^{1/k} = (3^k |z|^{2^k})^{1/k}=3 |z|^{2^k /k}. Now, as k approaches infinity, 2^k /k tends to infinity, so if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k} ≈(1 + (ln|z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈e^{(ln|z|)/k *2^k}=e^{(ln|z|) 2^k /k} which tends to infinity. Therefore, |a_k|^{1/k} tends to infinity. If |z| &lt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} tends to 0, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*0=0. If |z|=1, then |z|^{2^k /k}=1, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*1=3 &gt;1. Therefore, by the root test for series, the series converges absolutely when |z| &lt;1, diverges when |z| &gt;=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

So, both methods, the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem applied to the power series coefficients, and the root test applied to the series terms, give R=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

But let me just verify with a specific example. Take z=1/2. Then the series becomes sum 3^k (1/2)^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s compute the terms. For k=0: 1*(1/2)^1=1/2. k=1:3*(1/2)^2=3/4. k=2:9*(1/2)^4=9/16. k=3:27*(1/2)^8=27/256. k=4:81*(1/2)^16=81/65536. So, the terms are 1/2, 3/4, 9/16, 27/256, 81/65536,... Each term is (3/4)^k. Wait, but (3/4)^k? Wait, 3^k over 2^{2^k}. So, 3^k /4^{2^{k-1}}? Hmm, maybe not. Let&#x27;s see: for k=0: 3^0 /2^{2^0}=1/2. k=1:3/4. k=2:9/16. k=3:27/256. So, the denominators are 2, 4, 16, 256,... which is 2^{1}, 2^{2}, 2^{4}, 2^{8}, etc. So, denominator is 2^{2^k}. Therefore, each term is (3/4)^k * (1/2)^{2^k - 2^{k-1}}}? Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s overcomplicating.

But regardless, the terms are 3^k /2^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s check if that converges. Take the ratio of term k+1 over term k: (3^{k+1}/2^{2^{k+1}}}) / (3^k /2^{2^k}}) =3 /2^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 /2^{2^k(2 -1)}=3 /2^{2^k}. As k increases, the denominator is growing exponentially, so the ratio tends to zero. Therefore, by the ratio test, the series converges absolutely for z=1/2. Similarly, if we take |z|=r &lt;1, then |a_k|=3^k r^{2^k}, and the ratio |a_{k+1}| / |a_k| =3 r^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 r^{2^k}. Since r &lt;1, r^{2^k} tends to zero as k increases, so the ratio tends to zero, hence the series converges.

But if |z|=1, then |a_k|=3^k, which tends to infinity, so the series diverges. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k|=3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is even larger, so diverges. Therefore, all tests point to R=1.

Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

**Final Answer**
The radius of convergence is \boxed{1}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of convergence for the power series \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} \), we can use the root test and the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem.

1. **Root Test Approach**:
   - The series is given by \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Each term \( a_k = 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Applying the root test, we consider \( |a_k|^{1/k} = \left( 3^k |z|^{2^k} \right)^{1/k} = 3 |z|^{2^k / k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( 2^k / k \to \infty \). Therefore, if \( |z| &lt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to 0 \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to 0 \), which is less than 1, indicating convergence.
   - If \( |z| &gt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to \infty \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to \infty \), which is greater than 1, indicating divergence.
   - Thus, the series converges for \( |z| &lt; 1 \) and diverges for \( |z| &gt; 1 \).

2. **Cauchy-Hadamard Theorem**:
   - The theorem states \( R = 1 / \limsup_{n \to \infty} |c_n|^{1/n} \), where \( c_n \) are the coefficients of \( z^n \).
   - For our series, \( c_n = 3^k \) if \( n = 2^k \) and 0 otherwise.
   - We compute \( \limsup_{k \to \infty} |c_{2^k}|^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} (3^k)^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} 3^{k/2^k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( k/2^k \to 0 \), so \( 3^{k/2^k} \to 1 \). Hence, \( \limsup |c_n|^{1/n} = 1 \), giving \( R = 1 \).

Both methods confirm that the radius of convergence is \( \boxed{1} \).          </p>

Response: Let&#x27;s take a look at the terms in the power series: \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} \). For \(k=0\) we have the term \(3^0\cdot z^{2^0}=3\cdot z^{2^0}\). For \(k\equiv1 \bmod{2}\) we have the term \(3^{k-1}\cdot z^{2^{k-1}}=3^{k-1}\cdot z^{2^k}\). Notice both of these powers of z are integer multiples of \(2^k\). For \(k\equiv0 \bmod{2}\) we have the term \(3^{k}\cdot z^{2^k}=3^{k}\cdot z^{2^{k+1}}\). Notice that the power of z now gets increased by 1.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of convergence for this power series: the sum from k=0 to infinity of 3^k times z raised to the 2^k power. Hmm, power series... radius of convergence... right. The radius of convergence is the value R such that the series converges if |z| &lt; R and diverges if |z| &gt; R. Got it.

But wait, this isn&#x27;t a standard power series where the exponents are just n or something. The exponents here are 2^k. So, the powers of z are increasing really quickly.

So, maybe the standard root test or ratio test need some adjustments here?

Let me recall. For a standard power series sum a_n z^n, the radius of convergence R can be found using the root test: 1/R = lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}. But in this case, the exponents are not n, but 2^k. So, the coefficients are 3^k when the exponent is 2^k, and for other exponents, the coefficients are zero. So, the series is sparse, with lots of missing terms. So, maybe writing it in the standard form would involve a lot of zero coefficients. For example, between z^4 and z^8, there are z^5, z^6, z^7 terms missing, all with coefficient zero.

So, if I try to write this as sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n z^n, then c_n is 3^k if n = 2^k for some k, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the coefficients c_n are mostly zero except when n is a power of 2. Then, to compute the radius of convergence using the root test, which is lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So, since most c_n are zero, the lim sup would be the supremum of the limit points of |c_n|^{1/n}. But since the non-zero terms are at n=2^k, we can look at the limit as k approaches infinity of |c_{2^k}|^{1/(2^k)}. Because for n=2^k, c_n =3^k, so |c_n|^{1/n} = (3^k)^{1/(2^k)} = 3^{k / 2^k}. So, the lim sup would be the limit of 3^{k / 2^k} as k approaches infinity. Then, if that limit exists, that would be the value.

But first, let me compute k / 2^k as k approaches infinity. What&#x27;s the limit of k / 2^k? Hmm, as k grows, 2^k grows exponentially, while k grows linearly, so the limit should be zero. Therefore, 3^{k / 2^k} is 3^0 = 1. Therefore, the lim sup is 1, so 1/R =1, so R=1. Wait, so does that mean the radius of convergence is 1? But let me verify that again.

Wait, hold on. The root test for power series says that R = 1 / lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So here, the lim sup is 1, so R=1. But let me check with the ratio test as well, maybe. Although, ratio test is usually for when the terms are non-zero and you can take the ratio of consecutive terms. But here, the problem is that the terms are not consecutive. The exponents jump from 2^k to 2^{k+1}, which is doubling each time. So, between z^{2^k} and z^{2^{k+1}}, there are a lot of terms missing. So, maybe the ratio test isn&#x27;t directly applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the root test as applied to the series terms. The root test for the series convergence says that the series converges absolutely if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt; 1. Wait, but here the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}. So, each term is a_k = 3^k z^{2^k}. So, if I consider the lim sup of |a_k|^{1/k} = lim sup |3^k z^{2^k}|^{1/k} = lim sup (3 |z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = 3^{1/k} |z|^{2^k / k}.

So, as k approaches infinity, 3^{1/k} tends to 1, and |z|^{2^k / k}. Now, if |z| &lt; 1, then |z|^{2^k / k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k}. Since |z| &lt;1, |z|^{2^k} tends to zero as k approaches infinity. So, |z|^{2^k / k} = e^{(2^k / k) ln |z|}. Since ln |z| is negative, and 2^k / k tends to infinity, so this exponent tends to negative infinity, hence |z|^{2^k /k} tends to zero. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = 0 &lt;1, so the series converges absolutely.

If |z| =1, then |z|^{2^k / k} =1^{2^k /k}=1, so lim sup |a_k|^{1/k}=1. So, the root test is inconclusive here. Wait, but if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k}. Since |z| &gt;1, |z|^{1/k} = e^{(ln |z|)/k} ≈1 + (ln |z|)/k as k is large. Then, (1 + (ln |z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈ e^{(ln |z|)/k * 2^k} = e^{(ln |z|) 2^k /k}. Since 2^k /k tends to infinity, this exponent tends to infinity, so |z|^{2^k /k} tends to infinity. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = infinity, which is greater than 1, so the series diverges.

Wait, but hold on. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k| = 3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is 3^k times something growing exponentially (since |z|^{2^k} is like e^{2^k ln |z|}, which is exponential in 2^k). So, the terms themselves are going to infinity, so the series diverges. So, in this case, if |z| &gt;1, the terms don&#x27;t even approach zero, so the series diverges.

If |z| =1, then |a_k|=3^k *1^{2^k}=3^k, which tends to infinity, so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero, so the series diverges on |z|=1.

But wait, when |z| &lt;1, we saw that |a_k|^{1/k} tends to zero, so the root test tells us the series converges absolutely. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. But wait, but when I first considered the standard root test for power series (the lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}), I also got R=1. So, that seems consistent.

But let me check another approach. Since the exponents are 2^k, maybe substituting w = z^2 or something. Wait, but the exponents are 2^k, which is doubling each time. So, for k=0: 1, k=1:2, k=2:4, k=3:8, etc. So, the exponents are 2^k. So, the series can be written as sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}.

Alternatively, think of this as a lacunary series. I remember that lacunary series have gaps between exponents, and their convergence can be tricky. But maybe in this case, since the gaps are increasing exponentially, maybe the radius of convergence is still 1. But let me see.

Alternatively, suppose we use the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem. The theorem states that the radius of convergence R is given by 1 / lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}, where a_n is the coefficient of z^n. But in our case, as mentioned before, a_n is 3^k when n=2^k, otherwise 0. So, the lim sup is the supremum of all limit points of |a_n|^{1/n}. The non-zero terms are at n=2^k, so we need to compute lim sup_{n-&gt;infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} |3^k|^{1/2^k} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} 3^{k/2^k}.

As k approaches infinity, k/2^k approaches 0, as 2^k grows exponentially. Therefore, 3^{k/2^k} = e^{(k/2^k) ln 3} tends to e^0 =1. Therefore, lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}=1, so R=1/1=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. So, that&#x27;s the same answer as before.

Alternatively, if I use the root test on the series terms. For a general series sum a_k, the root test says that if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt;1, then converges absolutely; if &gt;1, diverges. Here, the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}, so each term a_k =3^k z^{2^k}. So, |a_k|^{1/k} = (3^k |z|^{2^k})^{1/k}=3 |z|^{2^k /k}. Now, as k approaches infinity, 2^k /k tends to infinity, so if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k} ≈(1 + (ln|z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈e^{(ln|z|)/k *2^k}=e^{(ln|z|) 2^k /k} which tends to infinity. Therefore, |a_k|^{1/k} tends to infinity. If |z| &lt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} tends to 0, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*0=0. If |z|=1, then |z|^{2^k /k}=1, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*1=3 &gt;1. Therefore, by the root test for series, the series converges absolutely when |z| &lt;1, diverges when |z| &gt;=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

So, both methods, the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem applied to the power series coefficients, and the root test applied to the series terms, give R=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

But let me just verify with a specific example. Take z=1/2. Then the series becomes sum 3^k (1/2)^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s compute the terms. For k=0: 1*(1/2)^1=1/2. k=1:3*(1/2)^2=3/4. k=2:9*(1/2)^4=9/16. k=3:27*(1/2)^8=27/256. k=4:81*(1/2)^16=81/65536. So, the terms are 1/2, 3/4, 9/16, 27/256, 81/65536,... Each term is (3/4)^k. Wait, but (3/4)^k? Wait, 3^k over 2^{2^k}. So, 3^k /4^{2^{k-1}}? Hmm, maybe not. Let&#x27;s see: for k=0: 3^0 /2^{2^0}=1/2. k=1:3/4. k=2:9/16. k=3:27/256. So, the denominators are 2, 4, 16, 256,... which is 2^{1}, 2^{2}, 2^{4}, 2^{8}, etc. So, denominator is 2^{2^k}. Therefore, each term is (3/4)^k * (1/2)^{2^k - 2^{k-1}}}? Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s overcomplicating.

But regardless, the terms are 3^k /2^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s check if that converges. Take the ratio of term k+1 over term k: (3^{k+1}/2^{2^{k+1}}}) / (3^k /2^{2^k}}) =3 /2^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 /2^{2^k(2 -1)}=3 /2^{2^k}. As k increases, the denominator is growing exponentially, so the ratio tends to zero. Therefore, by the ratio test, the series converges absolutely for z=1/2. Similarly, if we take |z|=r &lt;1, then |a_k|=3^k r^{2^k}, and the ratio |a_{k+1}| / |a_k| =3 r^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 r^{2^k}. Since r &lt;1, r^{2^k} tends to zero as k increases, so the ratio tends to zero, hence the series converges.

But if |z|=1, then |a_k|=3^k, which tends to infinity, so the series diverges. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k|=3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is even larger, so diverges. Therefore, all tests point to R=1.

Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

**Final Answer**
The radius of convergence is \boxed{1}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of convergence for the power series \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} \), we can use the root test and the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem.

1. **Root Test Approach**:
   - The series is given by \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Each term \( a_k = 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Applying the root test, we consider \( |a_k|^{1/k} = \left( 3^k |z|^{2^k} \right)^{1/k} = 3 |z|^{2^k / k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( 2^k / k \to \infty \). Therefore, if \( |z| &lt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to 0 \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to 0 \), which is less than 1, indicating convergence.
   - If \( |z| &gt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to \infty \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to \infty \), which is greater than 1, indicating divergence.
   - Thus, the series converges for \( |z| &lt; 1 \) and diverges for \( |z| &gt; 1 \).

2. **Cauchy-Hadamard Theorem**:
   - The theorem states \( R = 1 / \limsup_{n \to \infty} |c_n|^{1/n} \), where \( c_n \) are the coefficients of \( z^n \).
   - For our series, \( c_n = 3^k \) if \( n = 2^k \) and 0 otherwise.
   - We compute \( \limsup_{k \to \infty} |c_{2^k}|^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} (3^k)^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} 3^{k/2^k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( k/2^k \to 0 \), so \( 3^{k/2^k} \to 1 \). Hence, \( \limsup |c_n|^{1/n} = 1 \), giving \( R = 1 \).

Both methods confirm that the radius of convergence is \( \boxed{1} \).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of convergence for this power series: the sum from k=0 to infinity of 3^k times z raised to the 2^k power. Hmm, power series... radius of convergence... right. The radius of convergence is the value R such that the series converges if |z| &lt; R and diverges if |z| &gt; R. Got it.

But wait, this isn&#x27;t a standard power series where the exponents are just n or something. The exponents here are 2^k. So, the powers of z are increasing really quickly. Like, for k=0, it&#x27;s z^1, k=1 is z^2, k=2 is z^4, k=3 is z^8, and so on. So, the exponents are like 2^k instead of k. That&#x27;s different. So, maybe the standard root test or ratio test need some adjustments here?

Let me recall. For a standard power series sum a_n z^n, the radius of convergence R can be found using the root test: 1/R = lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}. But in this case, the exponents are not n, but 2^k. So, the coefficients are 3^k when the exponent is 2^k, and for other exponents, the coefficients are zero. So, the series is sparse, with lots of missing terms. So, maybe writing it in the standard form would involve a lot of zero coefficients. For example, between z^4 and z^8, there are z^5, z^6, z^7 terms missing, all with coefficient zero.

So, if I try to write this as sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n z^n, then c_n is 3^k if n = 2^k for some k, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the coefficients c_n are mostly zero except when n is a power of 2. Then, to compute the radius of convergence using the root test, which is lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So, since most c_n are zero, the lim sup would be the supremum of the limit points of |c_n|^{1/n}. But since the non-zero terms are at n=2^k, we can look at the limit as k approaches infinity of |c_{2^k}|^{1/(2^k)}. Because for n=2^k, c_n =3^k, so |c_n|^{1/n} = (3^k)^{1/(2^k)} = 3^{k / 2^k}. So, the lim sup would be the limit of 3^{k / 2^k} as k approaches infinity. Then, if that limit exists, that would be the value.

But first, let me compute k / 2^k as k approaches infinity. What&#x27;s the limit of k / 2^k? Hmm, as k grows, 2^k grows exponentially, while k grows linearly, so the limit should be zero. Therefore, 3^{k / 2^k} is 3^0 = 1. Therefore, the lim sup is 1, so 1/R =1, so R=1. Wait, so does that mean the radius of convergence is 1? But let me verify that again.

Wait, hold on. The root test for power series says that R = 1 / lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So here, the lim sup is 1, so R=1. But let me check with the ratio test as well, maybe. Although, ratio test is usually for when the terms are non-zero and you can take the ratio of consecutive terms. But here, the problem is that the terms are not consecutive. The exponents jump from 2^k to 2^{k+1}, which is doubling each time. So, between z^{2^k} and z^{2^{k+1}}, there are a lot of terms missing. So, maybe the ratio test isn&#x27;t directly applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the root test as applied to the series terms. The root test for the series convergence says that the series converges absolutely if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt; 1. Wait, but here the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}. So, each term is a_k = 3^k z^{2^k}. So, if I consider the lim sup of |a_k|^{1/k} = lim sup |3^k z^{2^k}|^{1/k} = lim sup (3 |z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = 3^{1/k} |z|^{2^k / k}.

So, as k approaches infinity, 3^{1/k} tends to 1, and |z|^{2^k / k}. Now, if |z| &lt; 1, then |z|^{2^k / k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k}. Since |z| &lt;1, |z|^{2^k} tends to zero as k approaches infinity. So, |z|^{2^k / k} = e^{(2^k / k) ln |z|}. Since ln |z| is negative, and 2^k / k tends to infinity, so this exponent tends to negative infinity, hence |z|^{2^k /k} tends to zero. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = 0 &lt;1, so the series converges absolutely.

If |z| =1, then |z|^{2^k / k} =1^{2^k /k}=1, so lim sup |a_k|^{1/k}=1. So, the root test is inconclusive here. Wait, but if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k}. Since |z| &gt;1, |z|^{1/k} = e^{(ln |z|)/k} ≈1 + (ln |z|)/k as k is large. Then, (1 + (ln |z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈ e^{(ln |z|)/k * 2^k} = e^{(ln |z|) 2^k /k}. Since 2^k /k tends to infinity, this exponent tends to infinity, so |z|^{2^k /k} tends to infinity. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = infinity, which is greater than 1, so the series diverges.

Wait, but hold on. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k| = 3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is 3^k times something growing exponentially (since |z|^{2^k} is like e^{2^k ln |z|}, which is exponential in 2^k). So, the terms themselves are going to infinity, so the series diverges. So, in this case, if |z| &gt;1, the terms don&#x27;t even approach zero, so the series diverges.

If |z| =1, then |a_k|=3^k *1^{2^k}=3^k, which tends to infinity, so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero, so the series diverges on |z|=1.

But wait, when |z| &lt;1, we saw that |a_k|^{1/k} tends to zero, so the root test tells us the series converges absolutely. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. But wait, but when I first considered the standard root test for power series (the lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}), I also got R=1. So, that seems consistent.

But let me check another approach. Since the exponents are 2^k, maybe substituting w = z^2 or something. Wait, but the exponents are 2^k, which is doubling each time. So, for k=0: 1, k=1:2, k=2:4, k=3:8, etc. So, the exponents are 2^k. So, the series can be written as sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}.

Alternatively, think of this as a lacunary series. I remember that lacunary series have gaps between exponents, and their convergence can be tricky. But maybe in this case, since the gaps are increasing exponentially, maybe the radius of convergence is still 1. But let me see.

Alternatively, suppose we use the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem. The theorem states that the radius of convergence R is given by 1 / lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}, where a_n is the coefficient of z^n. But in our case, as mentioned before, a_n is 3^k when n=2^k, otherwise 0. So, the lim sup is the supremum of all limit points of |a_n|^{1/n}. The non-zero terms are at n=2^k, so we need to compute lim sup_{n-&gt;infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} |3^k|^{1/2^k} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} 3^{k/2^k}.

As k approaches infinity, k/2^k approaches 0, as 2^k grows exponentially. Therefore, 3^{k/2^k} = e^{(k/2^k) ln 3} tends to e^0 =1. Therefore, lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}=1, so R=1/1=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. So, that&#x27;s the same answer as before.

Alternatively, if I use the root test on the series terms. For a general series sum a_k, the root test says that if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt;1, then converges absolutely; if &gt;1, diverges. Here, the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}, so each term a_k =3^k z^{2^k}. So, |a_k|^{1/k} = (3^k |z|^{2^k})^{1/k}=3 |z|^{2^k /k}. Now, as k approaches infinity, 2^k /k tends to infinity, so if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k} ≈(1 + (ln|z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈e^{(ln|z|)/k *2^k}=e^{(ln|z|) 2^k /k} which tends to infinity. Therefore, |a_k|^{1/k} tends to infinity. If |z| &lt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} tends to 0, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*0=0. If |z|=1, then |z|^{2^k /k}=1, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*1=3 &gt;1. Therefore, by the root test for series, the series converges absolutely when |z| &lt;1, diverges when |z| &gt;=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

So, both methods, the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem applied to the power series coefficients, and the root test applied to the series terms, give R=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

But let me just verify with a specific example. Take z=1/2. Then the series becomes sum 3^k (1/2)^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s compute the terms. For k=0: 1*(1/2)^1=1/2. k=1:3*(1/2)^2=3/4. k=2:9*(1/2)^4=9/16. k=3:27*(1/2)^8=27/256. k=4:81*(1/2)^16=81/65536. So, the terms are 1/2, 3/4, 9/16, 27/256, 81/65536,... Each term is (3/4)^k. Wait, but (3/4)^k? Wait, 3^k over 2^{2^k}. So, 3^k /4^{2^{k-1}}? Hmm, maybe not. Let&#x27;s see: for k=0: 3^0 /2^{2^0}=1/2. k=1:3/4. k=2:9/16. k=3:27/256. So, the denominators are 2, 4, 16, 256,... which is 2^{1}, 2^{2}, 2^{4}, 2^{8}, etc. So, denominator is 2^{2^k}. Therefore, each term is (3/4)^k * (1/2)^{2^k - 2^{k-1}}}? Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s overcomplicating.

But regardless, the terms are 3^k /2^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s check if that converges. Take the ratio of term k+1 over term k: (3^{k+1}/2^{2^{k+1}}}) / (3^k /2^{2^k}}) =3 /2^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 /2^{2^k(2 -1)}=3 /2^{2^k}. As k increases, the denominator is growing exponentially, so the ratio tends to zero. Therefore, by the ratio test, the series converges absolutely for z=1/2. Similarly, if we take |z|=r &lt;1, then |a_k|=3^k r^{2^k}, and the ratio |a_{k+1}| / |a_k| =3 r^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 r^{2^k}. Since r &lt;1, r^{2^k} tends to zero as k increases, so the ratio tends to zero, hence the series converges.

But if |z|=1, then |a_k|=3^k, which tends to infinity, so the series diverges. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k|=3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is even larger, so diverges. Therefore, all tests point to R=1.

Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

**Final Answer**
The radius of convergence is \boxed{1}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of convergence for the power series \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} \), we can use the root test and the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem.

1. **Root Test Approach**:
   - The series is given by \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Each term \( a_k = 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Applying the root test, we consider \( |a_k|^{1/k} = \left( 3^k |z|^{2^k} \right)^{1/k} = 3 |z|^{2^k / k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( 2^k / k \to \infty \). Therefore, if \( |z| &lt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to 0 \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to 0 \), which is less than 1, indicating convergence.
   - If \( |z| &gt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to \infty \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to \infty \), which is greater than 1, indicating divergence.
   - Thus, the series converges for \( |z| &lt; 1 \) and diverges for \( |z| &gt; 1 \).

2. **Cauchy-Hadamard Theorem**:
   - The theorem states \( R = 1 / \limsup_{n \to \infty} |c_n|^{1/n} \), where \( c_n \) are the coefficients of \( z^n \).
   - For our series, \( c_n = 3^k \) if \( n = 2^k \) and 0 otherwise.
   - We compute \( \limsup_{k \to \infty} |c_{2^k}|^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} (3^k)^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} 3^{k/2^k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( k/2^k \to 0 \), so \( 3^{k/2^k} \to 1 \). Hence, \( \limsup |c_n|^{1/n} = 1 \), giving \( R = 1 \).

Both methods confirm that the radius of convergence is \( \boxed{1} \).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of convergence for this power series: the sum from k=0 to infinity of 3^k times z raised to the 2^k power. Hmm, power series... radius of convergence... right. The radius of convergence is the value R such that the series converges if |z| &lt; R and diverges if |z| &gt; R. Got it.

But wait, this isn&#x27;t a standard power series where the exponents are just n or something. The exponents here are 2^k. So, the powers of z are increasing really quickly. Like, for k=0, it&#x27;s z^1, k=1 is z^2, k=2 is z^4, k=3 is z^8, and so on. So, the exponents are like 2^k instead of k. That&#x27;s different. So, maybe the standard root test or ratio test need some adjustments here?

Let me recall. For a standard power series sum a_n z^n, the radius of convergence R can be found using the root test: 1/R = lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}. But in this case, the exponents are not n, but 2^k. So, the coefficients are 3^k when the exponent is 2^k, and for other exponents, the coefficients are zero. So, the series is sparse, with lots of missing terms. So, maybe writing it in the standard form would involve a lot of zero coefficients. For example, between z^4 and z^8, there are z^5, z^6, z^7 terms missing, all with coefficient zero.

So, if I try to write this as sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n z^n, then c_n is 3^k if n = 2^k for some k, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the coefficients c_n are mostly zero except when n is a power of 2. Then, to compute the radius of convergence using the root test, which is lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So, since most c_n are zero, the lim sup would be the supremum of the limit points of |c_n|^{1/n}. But since the non-zero terms are at n=2^k, we can look at the limit as k approaches infinity of |c_{2^k}|^{1/(2^k)}. Because for n=2^k, c_n =3^k, so |c_n|^{1/n} = (3^k)^{1/(2^k)} = 3^{k / 2^k}. So, the lim sup would be the limit of 3^{k / 2^k} as k approaches infinity. Then, if that limit exists, that would be the value.

But first, let me compute k / 2^k as k approaches infinity. What&#x27;s the limit of k / 2^k? Hmm, as k grows, 2^k grows exponentially, while k grows linearly, so the limit should be zero. Therefore, 3^{k / 2^k} is 3^0 = 1. Therefore, the lim sup is 1, so 1/R =1, so R=1. Wait, so does that mean the radius of convergence is 1? But let me verify that again.

Wait, hold on. The root test for power series says that R = 1 / lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So here, the lim sup is 1, so R=1. But let me check with the ratio test as well, maybe. Although, ratio test is usually for when the terms are non-zero and you can take the ratio of consecutive terms. But here, the problem is that the terms are not consecutive. The exponents jump from 2^k to 2^{k+1}, which is doubling each time. So, between z^{2^k} and z^{2^{k+1}}, there are a lot of terms missing. So, maybe the ratio test isn&#x27;t directly applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the root test as applied to the series terms. The root test for the series convergence says that the series converges absolutely if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt; 1. Wait, but here the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}. So, each term is a_k = 3^k z^{2^k}. So, if I consider the lim sup of |a_k|^{1/k} = lim sup |3^k z^{2^k}|^{1/k} = lim sup (3 |z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = 3^{1/k} |z|^{2^k / k}.

So, as k approaches infinity, 3^{1/k} tends to 1, and |z|^{2^k / k}. Now, if |z| &lt; 1, then |z|^{2^k / k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k}. Since |z| &lt;1, |z|^{2^k} tends to zero as k approaches infinity. So, |z|^{2^k / k} = e^{(2^k / k) ln |z|}. Since ln |z| is negative, and 2^k / k tends to infinity, so this exponent tends to negative infinity, hence |z|^{2^k /k} tends to zero. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = 0 &lt;1, so the series converges absolutely.

If |z| =1, then |z|^{2^k / k} =1^{2^k /k}=1, so lim sup |a_k|^{1/k}=1. So, the root test is inconclusive here. Wait, but if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k}. Since |z| &gt;1, |z|^{1/k} = e^{(ln |z|)/k} ≈1 + (ln |z|)/k as k is large. Then, (1 + (ln |z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈ e^{(ln |z|)/k * 2^k} = e^{(ln |z|) 2^k /k}. Since 2^k /k tends to infinity, this exponent tends to infinity, so |z|^{2^k /k} tends to infinity. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = infinity, which is greater than 1, so the series diverges.

Wait, but hold on. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k| = 3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is 3^k times something growing exponentially (since |z|^{2^k} is like e^{2^k ln |z|}, which is exponential in 2^k). So, the terms themselves are going to infinity, so the series diverges. So, in this case, if |z| &gt;1, the terms don&#x27;t even approach zero, so the series diverges.

If |z| =1, then |a_k|=3^k *1^{2^k}=3^k, which tends to infinity, so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero, so the series diverges on |z|=1.

But wait, when |z| &lt;1, we saw that |a_k|^{1/k} tends to zero, so the root test tells us the series converges absolutely. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. But wait, but when I first considered the standard root test for power series (the lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}), I also got R=1. So, that seems consistent.

But let me check another approach. Since the exponents are 2^k, maybe substituting w = z^2 or something. Wait, but the exponents are 2^k, which is doubling each time. So, for k=0: 1, k=1:2, k=2:4, k=3:8, etc. So, the exponents are 2^k. So, the series can be written as sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}.

Alternatively, think of this as a lacunary series. I remember that lacunary series have gaps between exponents, and their convergence can be tricky. But maybe in this case, since the gaps are increasing exponentially, maybe the radius of convergence is still 1. But let me see.

Alternatively, suppose we use the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem. The theorem states that the radius of convergence R is given by 1 / lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}, where a_n is the coefficient of z^n. But in our case, as mentioned before, a_n is 3^k when n=2^k, otherwise 0. So, the lim sup is the supremum of all limit points of |a_n|^{1/n}. The non-zero terms are at n=2^k, so we need to compute lim sup_{n-&gt;infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} |3^k|^{1/2^k} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} 3^{k/2^k}.

As k approaches infinity, k/2^k approaches 0, as 2^k grows exponentially. Therefore, 3^{k/2^k} = e^{(k/2^k) ln 3} tends to e^0 =1. Therefore, lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}=1, so R=1/1=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. So, that&#x27;s the same answer as before.

Alternatively, if I use the root test on the series terms. For a general series sum a_k, the root test says that if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt;1, then converges absolutely; if &gt;1, diverges. Here, the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}, so each term a_k =3^k z^{2^k}. So, |a_k|^{1/k} = (3^k |z|^{2^k})^{1/k}=3 |z|^{2^k /k}. Now, as k approaches infinity, 2^k /k tends to infinity, so if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k} ≈(1 + (ln|z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈e^{(ln|z|)/k *2^k}=e^{(ln|z|) 2^k /k} which tends to infinity. Therefore, |a_k|^{1/k} tends to infinity. If |z| &lt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} tends to 0, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*0=0. If |z|=1, then |z|^{2^k /k}=1, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*1=3 &gt;1. Therefore, by the root test for series, the series converges absolutely when |z| &lt;1, diverges when |z| &gt;=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

So, both methods, the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem applied to the power series coefficients, and the root test applied to the series terms, give R=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

But let me just verify with a specific example. Take z=1/2. Then the series becomes sum 3^k (1/2)^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s compute the terms. For k=0: 1*(1/2)^1=1/2. k=1:3*(1/2)^2=3/4. k=2:9*(1/2)^4=9/16. k=3:27*(1/2)^8=27/256. k=4:81*(1/2)^16=81/65536. So, the terms are 1/2, 3/4, 9/16, 27/256, 81/65536,... Each term is (3/4)^k. Wait, but (3/4)^k? Wait, 3^k over 2^{2^k}. So, 3^k /4^{2^{k-1}}? Hmm, maybe not. Let&#x27;s see: for k=0: 3^0 /2^{2^0}=1/2. k=1:3/4. k=2:9/16. k=3:27/256. So, the denominators are 2, 4, 16, 256,... which is 2^{1}, 2^{2}, 2^{4}, 2^{8}, etc. So, denominator is 2^{2^k}. Therefore, each term is (3/4)^k * (1/2)^{2^k - 2^{k-1}}}? Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s overcomplicating.

But regardless, the terms are 3^k /2^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s check if that converges. Take the ratio of term k+1 over term k: (3^{k+1}/2^{2^{k+1}}}) / (3^k /2^{2^k}}) =3 /2^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 /2^{2^k(2 -1)}=3 /2^{2^k}. As k increases, the denominator is growing exponentially, so the ratio tends to zero. Therefore, by the ratio test, the series converges absolutely for z=1/2. Similarly, if we take |z|=r &lt;1, then |a_k|=3^k r^{2^k}, and the ratio |a_{k+1}| / |a_k| =3 r^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 r^{2^k}. Since r &lt;1, r^{2^k} tends to zero as k increases, so the ratio tends to zero, hence the series converges.

But if |z|=1, then |a_k|=3^k, which tends to infinity, so the series diverges. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k|=3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is even larger, so diverges. Therefore, all tests point to R=1.

Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

**Final Answer**
The radius of convergence is \boxed{1}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of convergence for the power series \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} \), we can use the root test and the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem.

1. **Root Test Approach**:
   - The series is given by \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Each term \( a_k = 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Applying the root test, we consider \( |a_k|^{1/k} = \left( 3^k |z|^{2^k} \right)^{1/k} = 3 |z|^{2^k / k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( 2^k / k \to \infty \). Therefore, if \( |z| &lt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to 0 \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to 0 \), which is less than 1, indicating convergence.
   - If \( |z| &gt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to \infty \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to \infty \), which is greater than 1, indicating divergence.
   - Thus, the series converges for \( |z| &lt; 1 \) and diverges for \( |z| &gt; 1 \).

2. **Cauchy-Hadamard Theorem**:
   - The theorem states \( R = 1 / \limsup_{n \to \infty} |c_n|^{1/n} \), where \( c_n \) are the coefficients of \( z^n \).
   - For our series, \( c_n = 3^k \) if \( n = 2^k \) and 0 otherwise.
   - We compute \( \limsup_{k \to \infty} |c_{2^k}|^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} (3^k)^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} 3^{k/2^k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( k/2^k \to 0 \), so \( 3^{k/2^k} \to 1 \). Hence, \( \limsup |c_n|^{1/n} = 1 \), giving \( R = 1 \).

Both methods confirm that the radius of convergence is \( \boxed{1} \).          </p>

Hmm, power series... radius of convergence... right. The radius of convergence is the value R such that the series converges if |z| &lt; R and diverges if |z| &gt; R. Got it.

So, maybe the standard root test or ratio test need some adjustments here?

Let me recall. For a standard power series sum a_n z^n, the radius of convergence R can be found using the root test: 1/R = lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}. But in this case, the exponents are not n, but 2^k. So, the coefficients are 3^k when the exponent is 2^k, and for other exponents, the coefficients are zero. So, the series is sparse, with lots of missing terms. So, maybe writing it in the standard form would involve a lot of zero coefficients. For example, between z^4 and z^8, there are z^5, z^6, z^7 terms missing, all with coefficient zero.

So, if I try to write this as sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n z^n, then c_n is 3^k if n = 2^k for some k, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the coefficients c_n are mostly zero except when n is a power of 2. Then, to compute the radius of convergence using the root test, which is lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So, since most c_n are zero, the lim sup would be the supremum of the limit points of |c_n|^{1/n}. But since the non-zero terms are at n=2^k, we can look at the limit as k approaches infinity of |c_{2^k}|^{1/(2^k)}. Because for n=2^k, c_n =3^k, so |c_n|^{1/n} = (3^k)^{1/(2^k)} = 3^{k / 2^k}. So, the lim sup would be the limit of 3^{k / 2^k} as k approaches infinity. Then, if that limit exists, that would be the value.

But first, let me compute k / 2^k as k approaches infinity. What&#x27;s the limit of k / 2^k? Hmm, as k grows, 2^k grows exponentially, while k grows linearly, so the limit should be zero. Therefore, 3^{k / 2^k} is 3^0 = 1. Therefore, the lim sup is 1, so 1/R =1, so R=1. Wait, so does that mean the radius of convergence is 1? But let me verify that again.

Wait, hold on. The root test for power series says that R = 1 / lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So here, the lim sup is 1, so R=1. But let me check with the ratio test as well, maybe. Although, ratio test is usually for when the terms are non-zero and you can take the ratio of consecutive terms. But here, the problem is that the terms are not consecutive. The exponents jump from 2^k to 2^{k+1}, which is doubling each time. So, between z^{2^k} and z^{2^{k+1}}, there are a lot of terms missing. So, maybe the ratio test isn&#x27;t directly applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the root test as applied to the series terms. The root test for the series convergence says that the series converges absolutely if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt; 1. Wait, but here the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}. So, each term is a_k = 3^k z^{2^k}. So, if I consider the lim sup of |a_k|^{1/k} = lim sup |3^k z^{2^k}|^{1/k} = lim sup (3 |z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = 3^{1/k} |z|^{2^k / k}.

So, as k approaches infinity, 3^{1/k} tends to 1, and |z|^{2^k / k}. Now, if |z| &lt; 1, then |z|^{2^k / k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k}. Since |z| &lt;1, |z|^{2^k} tends to zero as k approaches infinity. So, |z|^{2^k / k} = e^{(2^k / k) ln |z|}. Since ln |z| is negative, and 2^k / k tends to infinity, so this exponent tends to negative infinity, hence |z|^{2^k /k} tends to zero. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = 0 &lt;1, so the series converges absolutely.

If |z| =1, then |z|^{2^k / k} =1^{2^k /k}=1, so lim sup |a_k|^{1/k}=1. So, the root test is inconclusive here. Wait, but if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k}. Since |z| &gt;1, |z|^{1/k} = e^{(ln |z|)/k} ≈1 + (ln |z|)/k as k is large. Then, (1 + (ln |z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈ e^{(ln |z|)/k * 2^k} = e^{(ln |z|) 2^k /k}. Since 2^k /k tends to infinity, this exponent tends to infinity, so |z|^{2^k /k} tends to infinity. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = infinity, which is greater than 1, so the series diverges.

Wait, but hold on. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k| = 3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is 3^k times something growing exponentially (since |z|^{2^k} is like e^{2^k ln |z|}, which is exponential in 2^k). So, the terms themselves are going to infinity, so the series diverges. So, in this case, if |z| &gt;1, the terms don&#x27;t even approach zero, so the series diverges.

If |z| =1, then |a_k|=3^k *1^{2^k}=3^k, which tends to infinity, so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero, so the series diverges on |z|=1.

But wait, when |z| &lt;1, we saw that |a_k|^{1/k} tends to zero, so the root test tells us the series converges absolutely. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. But wait, but when I first considered the standard root test for power series (the lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}), I also got R=1. So, that seems consistent.

But let me check another approach. Since the exponents are 2^k, maybe substituting w = z^2 or something. Wait, but the exponents are 2^k, which is doubling each time. So, for k=0: 1, k=1:2, k=2:4, k=3:8, etc. So, the exponents are 2^k. So, the series can be written as sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}.

Alternatively, think of this as a lacunary series. I remember that lacunary series have gaps between exponents, and their convergence can be tricky. But maybe in this case, since the gaps are increasing exponentially, maybe the radius of convergence is still 1. But let me see.

Alternatively, suppose we use the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem. The theorem states that the radius of convergence R is given by 1 / lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}, where a_n is the coefficient of z^n. But in our case, as mentioned before, a_n is 3^k when n=2^k, otherwise 0. So, the lim sup is the supremum of all limit points of |a_n|^{1/n}. The non-zero terms are at n=2^k, so we need to compute lim sup_{n-&gt;infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} |3^k|^{1/2^k} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} 3^{k/2^k}.

As k approaches infinity, k/2^k approaches 0, as 2^k grows exponentially. Therefore, 3^{k/2^k} = e^{(k/2^k) ln 3} tends to e^0 =1. Therefore, lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}=1, so R=1/1=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. So, that&#x27;s the same answer as before.

Alternatively, if I use the root test on the series terms. For a general series sum a_k, the root test says that if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt;1, then converges absolutely; if &gt;1, diverges. Here, the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}, so each term a_k =3^k z^{2^k}. So, |a_k|^{1/k} = (3^k |z|^{2^k})^{1/k}=3 |z|^{2^k /k}. Now, as k approaches infinity, 2^k /k tends to infinity, so if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k} ≈(1 + (ln|z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈e^{(ln|z|)/k *2^k}=e^{(ln|z|) 2^k /k} which tends to infinity. Therefore, |a_k|^{1/k} tends to infinity. If |z| &lt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} tends to 0, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*0=0. If |z|=1, then |z|^{2^k /k}=1, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*1=3 &gt;1. Therefore, by the root test for series, the series converges absolutely when |z| &lt;1, diverges when |z| &gt;=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

So, both methods, the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem applied to the power series coefficients, and the root test applied to the series terms, give R=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

But let me just verify with a specific example. Take z=1/2. Then the series becomes sum 3^k (1/2)^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s compute the terms. For k=0: 1*(1/2)^1=1/2. k=1:3*(1/2)^2=3/4. k=2:9*(1/2)^4=9/16. k=3:27*(1/2)^8=27/256. k=4:81*(1/2)^16=81/65536. So, the terms are 1/2, 3/4, 9/16, 27/256, 81/65536,... Each term is (3/4)^k. Wait, but (3/4)^k? Wait, 3^k over 2^{2^k}. So, 3^k /4^{2^{k-1}}? Hmm, maybe not. Let&#x27;s see: for k=0: 3^0 /2^{2^0}=1/2. k=1:3/4. k=2:9/16. k=3:27/256. So, the denominators are 2, 4, 16, 256,... which is 2^{1}, 2^{2}, 2^{4}, 2^{8}, etc. So, denominator is 2^{2^k}. Therefore, each term is (3/4)^k * (1/2)^{2^k - 2^{k-1}}}? Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s overcomplicating.

But regardless, the terms are 3^k /2^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s check if that converges. Take the ratio of term k+1 over term k: (3^{k+1}/2^{2^{k+1}}}) / (3^k /2^{2^k}}) =3 /2^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 /2^{2^k(2 -1)}=3 /2^{2^k}. As k increases, the denominator is growing exponentially, so the ratio tends to zero. Therefore, by the ratio test, the series converges absolutely for z=1/2. Similarly, if we take |z|=r &lt;1, then |a_k|=3^k r^{2^k}, and the ratio |a_{k+1}| / |a_k| =3 r^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 r^{2^k}. Since r &lt;1, r^{2^k} tends to zero as k increases, so the ratio tends to zero, hence the series converges.

But if |z|=1, then |a_k|=3^k, which tends to infinity, so the series diverges. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k|=3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is even larger, so diverges. Therefore, all tests point to R=1.

Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

**Final Answer**
The radius of convergence is \boxed{1}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of convergence for the power series \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} \), we can use the root test and the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem.

1. **Root Test Approach**:
   - The series is given by \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Each term \( a_k = 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Applying the root test, we consider \( |a_k|^{1/k} = \left( 3^k |z|^{2^k} \right)^{1/k} = 3 |z|^{2^k / k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( 2^k / k \to \infty \). Therefore, if \( |z| &lt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to 0 \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to 0 \), which is less than 1, indicating convergence.
   - If \( |z| &gt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to \infty \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to \infty \), which is greater than 1, indicating divergence.
   - Thus, the series converges for \( |z| &lt; 1 \) and diverges for \( |z| &gt; 1 \).

2. **Cauchy-Hadamard Theorem**:
   - The theorem states \( R = 1 / \limsup_{n \to \infty} |c_n|^{1/n} \), where \( c_n \) are the coefficients of \( z^n \).
   - For our series, \( c_n = 3^k \) if \( n = 2^k \) and 0 otherwise.
   - We compute \( \limsup_{k \to \infty} |c_{2^k}|^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} (3^k)^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} 3^{k/2^k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( k/2^k \to 0 \), so \( 3^{k/2^k} \to 1 \). Hence, \( \limsup |c_n|^{1/n} = 1 \), giving \( R = 1 \).

Both methods confirm that the radius of convergence is \( \boxed{1} \).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of convergence for this power series: the sum from k=0 to infinity of 3^k times z raised to the 2^k power. Hmm, power series... radius of convergence... right. The radius of convergence is the value R such that the series converges if |z| &lt; R and diverges if |z| &gt; R. Got it.

But wait, this isn&#x27;t a standard power series where the exponents are just n or something. The exponents here are 2^k. So, the powers of z are increasing really quickly. Like, for k=0, it&#x27;s z^1, k=1 is z^2, k=2 is z^4, k=3 is z^8, and so on. So, the exponents are like 2^k instead of k. That&#x27;s different. So, maybe the standard root test or ratio test need some adjustments here?

Let me recall. For a standard power series sum a_n z^n, the radius of convergence R can be found using the root test: 1/R = lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}. But in this case, the exponents are not n, but 2^k. So, the coefficients are 3^k when the exponent is 2^k, and for other exponents, the coefficients are zero. So, the series is sparse, with lots of missing terms. So, maybe writing it in the standard form would involve a lot of zero coefficients. For example, between z^4 and z^8, there are z^5, z^6, z^7 terms missing, all with coefficient zero.

So, if I try to write this as sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n z^n, then c_n is 3^k if n = 2^k for some k, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the coefficients c_n are mostly zero except when n is a power of 2. Then, to compute the radius of convergence using the root test, which is lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So, since most c_n are zero, the lim sup would be the supremum of the limit points of |c_n|^{1/n}. But since the non-zero terms are at n=2^k, we can look at the limit as k approaches infinity of |c_{2^k}|^{1/(2^k)}. Because for n=2^k, c_n =3^k, so |c_n|^{1/n} = (3^k)^{1/(2^k)} = 3^{k / 2^k}. So, the lim sup would be the limit of 3^{k / 2^k} as k approaches infinity. Then, if that limit exists, that would be the value.

But first, let me compute k / 2^k as k approaches infinity. What&#x27;s the limit of k / 2^k? Hmm, as k grows, 2^k grows exponentially, while k grows linearly, so the limit should be zero. Therefore, 3^{k / 2^k} is 3^0 = 1. Therefore, the lim sup is 1, so 1/R =1, so R=1. Wait, so does that mean the radius of convergence is 1? But let me verify that again.

Wait, hold on. The root test for power series says that R = 1 / lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So here, the lim sup is 1, so R=1. But let me check with the ratio test as well, maybe. Although, ratio test is usually for when the terms are non-zero and you can take the ratio of consecutive terms. But here, the problem is that the terms are not consecutive. The exponents jump from 2^k to 2^{k+1}, which is doubling each time. So, between z^{2^k} and z^{2^{k+1}}, there are a lot of terms missing. So, maybe the ratio test isn&#x27;t directly applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the root test as applied to the series terms. The root test for the series convergence says that the series converges absolutely if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt; 1. Wait, but here the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}. So, each term is a_k = 3^k z^{2^k}. So, if I consider the lim sup of |a_k|^{1/k} = lim sup |3^k z^{2^k}|^{1/k} = lim sup (3 |z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = 3^{1/k} |z|^{2^k / k}.

So, as k approaches infinity, 3^{1/k} tends to 1, and |z|^{2^k / k}. Now, if |z| &lt; 1, then |z|^{2^k / k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k}. Since |z| &lt;1, |z|^{2^k} tends to zero as k approaches infinity. So, |z|^{2^k / k} = e^{(2^k / k) ln |z|}. Since ln |z| is negative, and 2^k / k tends to infinity, so this exponent tends to negative infinity, hence |z|^{2^k /k} tends to zero. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = 0 &lt;1, so the series converges absolutely.

If |z| =1, then |z|^{2^k / k} =1^{2^k /k}=1, so lim sup |a_k|^{1/k}=1. So, the root test is inconclusive here. Wait, but if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k}. Since |z| &gt;1, |z|^{1/k} = e^{(ln |z|)/k} ≈1 + (ln |z|)/k as k is large. Then, (1 + (ln |z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈ e^{(ln |z|)/k * 2^k} = e^{(ln |z|) 2^k /k}. Since 2^k /k tends to infinity, this exponent tends to infinity, so |z|^{2^k /k} tends to infinity. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = infinity, which is greater than 1, so the series diverges.

Wait, but hold on. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k| = 3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is 3^k times something growing exponentially (since |z|^{2^k} is like e^{2^k ln |z|}, which is exponential in 2^k). So, the terms themselves are going to infinity, so the series diverges. So, in this case, if |z| &gt;1, the terms don&#x27;t even approach zero, so the series diverges.

If |z| =1, then |a_k|=3^k *1^{2^k}=3^k, which tends to infinity, so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero, so the series diverges on |z|=1.

But wait, when |z| &lt;1, we saw that |a_k|^{1/k} tends to zero, so the root test tells us the series converges absolutely. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. But wait, but when I first considered the standard root test for power series (the lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}), I also got R=1. So, that seems consistent.

But let me check another approach. Since the exponents are 2^k, maybe substituting w = z^2 or something. Wait, but the exponents are 2^k, which is doubling each time. So, for k=0: 1, k=1:2, k=2:4, k=3:8, etc. So, the exponents are 2^k. So, the series can be written as sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}.

Alternatively, think of this as a lacunary series. I remember that lacunary series have gaps between exponents, and their convergence can be tricky. But maybe in this case, since the gaps are increasing exponentially, maybe the radius of convergence is still 1. But let me see.

Alternatively, suppose we use the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem. The theorem states that the radius of convergence R is given by 1 / lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}, where a_n is the coefficient of z^n. But in our case, as mentioned before, a_n is 3^k when n=2^k, otherwise 0. So, the lim sup is the supremum of all limit points of |a_n|^{1/n}. The non-zero terms are at n=2^k, so we need to compute lim sup_{n-&gt;infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} |3^k|^{1/2^k} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} 3^{k/2^k}.

As k approaches infinity, k/2^k approaches 0, as 2^k grows exponentially. Therefore, 3^{k/2^k} = e^{(k/2^k) ln 3} tends to e^0 =1. Therefore, lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}=1, so R=1/1=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. So, that&#x27;s the same answer as before.

Alternatively, if I use the root test on the series terms. For a general series sum a_k, the root test says that if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt;1, then converges absolutely; if &gt;1, diverges. Here, the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}, so each term a_k =3^k z^{2^k}. So, |a_k|^{1/k} = (3^k |z|^{2^k})^{1/k}=3 |z|^{2^k /k}. Now, as k approaches infinity, 2^k /k tends to infinity, so if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k} ≈(1 + (ln|z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈e^{(ln|z|)/k *2^k}=e^{(ln|z|) 2^k /k} which tends to infinity. Therefore, |a_k|^{1/k} tends to infinity. If |z| &lt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} tends to 0, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*0=0. If |z|=1, then |z|^{2^k /k}=1, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*1=3 &gt;1. Therefore, by the root test for series, the series converges absolutely when |z| &lt;1, diverges when |z| &gt;=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

So, both methods, the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem applied to the power series coefficients, and the root test applied to the series terms, give R=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

But let me just verify with a specific example. Take z=1/2. Then the series becomes sum 3^k (1/2)^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s compute the terms. For k=0: 1*(1/2)^1=1/2. k=1:3*(1/2)^2=3/4. k=2:9*(1/2)^4=9/16. k=3:27*(1/2)^8=27/256. k=4:81*(1/2)^16=81/65536. So, the terms are 1/2, 3/4, 9/16, 27/256, 81/65536,... Each term is (3/4)^k. Wait, but (3/4)^k? Wait, 3^k over 2^{2^k}. So, 3^k /4^{2^{k-1}}? Hmm, maybe not. Let&#x27;s see: for k=0: 3^0 /2^{2^0}=1/2. k=1:3/4. k=2:9/16. k=3:27/256. So, the denominators are 2, 4, 16, 256,... which is 2^{1}, 2^{2}, 2^{4}, 2^{8}, etc. So, denominator is 2^{2^k}. Therefore, each term is (3/4)^k * (1/2)^{2^k - 2^{k-1}}}? Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s overcomplicating.

But regardless, the terms are 3^k /2^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s check if that converges. Take the ratio of term k+1 over term k: (3^{k+1}/2^{2^{k+1}}}) / (3^k /2^{2^k}}) =3 /2^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 /2^{2^k(2 -1)}=3 /2^{2^k}. As k increases, the denominator is growing exponentially, so the ratio tends to zero. Therefore, by the ratio test, the series converges absolutely for z=1/2. Similarly, if we take |z|=r &lt;1, then |a_k|=3^k r^{2^k}, and the ratio |a_{k+1}| / |a_k| =3 r^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 r^{2^k}. Since r &lt;1, r^{2^k} tends to zero as k increases, so the ratio tends to zero, hence the series converges.

But if |z|=1, then |a_k|=3^k, which tends to infinity, so the series diverges. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k|=3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is even larger, so diverges. Therefore, all tests point to R=1.

Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

**Final Answer**
The radius of convergence is \boxed{1}.

To determine the radius of convergence for the power series \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} \), we can use the root test and the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem.

1. **Root Test Approach**:
   - The series is given by \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Each term \( a_k = 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Applying the root test, we consider \( |a_k|^{1/k} = \left( 3^k |z|^{2^k} \right)^{1/k} = 3 |z|^{2^k / k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( 2^k / k \to \infty \). Therefore, if \( |z| &lt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to 0 \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to 0 \), which is less than 1, indicating convergence.
   - If \( |z| &gt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to \infty \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to \infty \), which is greater than 1, indicating divergence.
   - Thus, the series converges for \( |z| &lt; 1 \) and diverges for \( |z| &gt; 1 \).

2. **Cauchy-Hadamard Theorem**:
   - The theorem states \( R = 1 / \limsup_{n \to \infty} |c_n|^{1/n} \), where \( c_n \) are the coefficients of \( z^n \).
   - For our series, \( c_n = 3^k \) if \( n = 2^k \) and 0 otherwise.
   - We compute \( \limsup_{k \to \infty} |c_{2^k}|^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} (3^k)^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} 3^{k/2^k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( k/2^k \to 0 \), so \( 3^{k/2^k} \to 1 \). Hence, \( \limsup |c_n|^{1/n} = 1 \), giving \( R = 1 \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of convergence for this power series: the sum from k=0 to infinity of 3^k times z raised to the 2^k power. Hmm, power series... radius of convergence... right. The radius of convergence is the value R such that the series converges if |z| &lt; R and diverges if |z| &gt; R. Got it.

But wait, this isn&#x27;t a standard power series where the exponents are just n or something. The exponents here are 2^k. So, the powers of z are increasing really quickly. Like, for k=0, it&#x27;s z^1, k=1 is z^2, k=2 is z^4, k=3 is z^8, and so on. So, the exponents are like 2^k instead of k. That&#x27;s different. So, maybe the standard root test or ratio test need some adjustments here?

Let me recall. For a standard power series sum a_n z^n, the radius of convergence R can be found using the root test: 1/R = lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}. But in this case, the exponents are not n, but 2^k. So, the coefficients are 3^k when the exponent is 2^k, and for other exponents, the coefficients are zero. So, the series is sparse, with lots of missing terms. So, maybe writing it in the standard form would involve a lot of zero coefficients. For example, between z^4 and z^8, there are z^5, z^6, z^7 terms missing, all with coefficient zero.

So, if I try to write this as sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n z^n, then c_n is 3^k if n = 2^k for some k, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the coefficients c_n are mostly zero except when n is a power of 2. Then, to compute the radius of convergence using the root test, which is lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So, since most c_n are zero, the lim sup would be the supremum of the limit points of |c_n|^{1/n}. But since the non-zero terms are at n=2^k, we can look at the limit as k approaches infinity of |c_{2^k}|^{1/(2^k)}. Because for n=2^k, c_n =3^k, so |c_n|^{1/n} = (3^k)^{1/(2^k)} = 3^{k / 2^k}. So, the lim sup would be the limit of 3^{k / 2^k} as k approaches infinity. Then, if that limit exists, that would be the value.

But first, let me compute k / 2^k as k approaches infinity. What&#x27;s the limit of k / 2^k? Hmm, as k grows, 2^k grows exponentially, while k grows linearly, so the limit should be zero. Therefore, 3^{k / 2^k} is 3^0 = 1. Therefore, the lim sup is 1, so 1/R =1, so R=1. Wait, so does that mean the radius of convergence is 1? But let me verify that again.

Wait, hold on. The root test for power series says that R = 1 / lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So here, the lim sup is 1, so R=1. But let me check with the ratio test as well, maybe. Although, ratio test is usually for when the terms are non-zero and you can take the ratio of consecutive terms. But here, the problem is that the terms are not consecutive. The exponents jump from 2^k to 2^{k+1}, which is doubling each time. So, between z^{2^k} and z^{2^{k+1}}, there are a lot of terms missing. So, maybe the ratio test isn&#x27;t directly applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the root test as applied to the series terms. The root test for the series convergence says that the series converges absolutely if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt; 1. Wait, but here the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}. So, each term is a_k = 3^k z^{2^k}. So, if I consider the lim sup of |a_k|^{1/k} = lim sup |3^k z^{2^k}|^{1/k} = lim sup (3 |z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = 3^{1/k} |z|^{2^k / k}.

So, as k approaches infinity, 3^{1/k} tends to 1, and |z|^{2^k / k}. Now, if |z| &lt; 1, then |z|^{2^k / k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k}. Since |z| &lt;1, |z|^{2^k} tends to zero as k approaches infinity. So, |z|^{2^k / k} = e^{(2^k / k) ln |z|}. Since ln |z| is negative, and 2^k / k tends to infinity, so this exponent tends to negative infinity, hence |z|^{2^k /k} tends to zero. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = 0 &lt;1, so the series converges absolutely.

If |z| =1, then |z|^{2^k / k} =1^{2^k /k}=1, so lim sup |a_k|^{1/k}=1. So, the root test is inconclusive here. Wait, but if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k}. Since |z| &gt;1, |z|^{1/k} = e^{(ln |z|)/k} ≈1 + (ln |z|)/k as k is large. Then, (1 + (ln |z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈ e^{(ln |z|)/k * 2^k} = e^{(ln |z|) 2^k /k}. Since 2^k /k tends to infinity, this exponent tends to infinity, so |z|^{2^k /k} tends to infinity. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = infinity, which is greater than 1, so the series diverges.

Wait, but hold on. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k| = 3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is 3^k times something growing exponentially (since |z|^{2^k} is like e^{2^k ln |z|}, which is exponential in 2^k). So, the terms themselves are going to infinity, so the series diverges. So, in this case, if |z| &gt;1, the terms don&#x27;t even approach zero, so the series diverges.

If |z| =1, then |a_k|=3^k *1^{2^k}=3^k, which tends to infinity, so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero, so the series diverges on |z|=1.

But wait, when |z| &lt;1, we saw that |a_k|^{1/k} tends to zero, so the root test tells us the series converges absolutely. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. But wait, but when I first considered the standard root test for power series (the lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}), I also got R=1. So, that seems consistent.

But let me check another approach. Since the exponents are 2^k, maybe substituting w = z^2 or something. Wait, but the exponents are 2^k, which is doubling each time. So, for k=0: 1, k=1:2, k=2:4, k=3:8, etc. So, the exponents are 2^k. So, the series can be written as sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}.

Alternatively, think of this as a lacunary series. I remember that lacunary series have gaps between exponents, and their convergence can be tricky. But maybe in this case, since the gaps are increasing exponentially, maybe the radius of convergence is still 1. But let me see.

Alternatively, suppose we use the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem. The theorem states that the radius of convergence R is given by 1 / lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}, where a_n is the coefficient of z^n. But in our case, as mentioned before, a_n is 3^k when n=2^k, otherwise 0. So, the lim sup is the supremum of all limit points of |a_n|^{1/n}. The non-zero terms are at n=2^k, so we need to compute lim sup_{n-&gt;infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} |3^k|^{1/2^k} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} 3^{k/2^k}.

As k approaches infinity, k/2^k approaches 0, as 2^k grows exponentially. Therefore, 3^{k/2^k} = e^{(k/2^k) ln 3} tends to e^0 =1. Therefore, lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}=1, so R=1/1=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. So, that&#x27;s the same answer as before.

Alternatively, if I use the root test on the series terms. For a general series sum a_k, the root test says that if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt;1, then converges absolutely; if &gt;1, diverges. Here, the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}, so each term a_k =3^k z^{2^k}. So, |a_k|^{1/k} = (3^k |z|^{2^k})^{1/k}=3 |z|^{2^k /k}. Now, as k approaches infinity, 2^k /k tends to infinity, so if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k} ≈(1 + (ln|z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈e^{(ln|z|)/k *2^k}=e^{(ln|z|) 2^k /k} which tends to infinity. Therefore, |a_k|^{1/k} tends to infinity. If |z| &lt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} tends to 0, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*0=0. If |z|=1, then |z|^{2^k /k}=1, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*1=3 &gt;1. Therefore, by the root test for series, the series converges absolutely when |z| &lt;1, diverges when |z| &gt;=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

So, both methods, the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem applied to the power series coefficients, and the root test applied to the series terms, give R=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

But let me just verify with a specific example. Take z=1/2. Then the series becomes sum 3^k (1/2)^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s compute the terms. For k=0: 1*(1/2)^1=1/2. k=1:3*(1/2)^2=3/4. k=2:9*(1/2)^4=9/16. k=3:27*(1/2)^8=27/256. k=4:81*(1/2)^16=81/65536. So, the terms are 1/2, 3/4, 9/16, 27/256, 81/65536,... Each term is (3/4)^k. Wait, but (3/4)^k? Wait, 3^k over 2^{2^k}. So, 3^k /4^{2^{k-1}}? Hmm, maybe not. Let&#x27;s see: for k=0: 3^0 /2^{2^0}=1/2. k=1:3/4. k=2:9/16. k=3:27/256. So, the denominators are 2, 4, 16, 256,... which is 2^{1}, 2^{2}, 2^{4}, 2^{8}, etc. So, denominator is 2^{2^k}. Therefore, each term is (3/4)^k * (1/2)^{2^k - 2^{k-1}}}? Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s overcomplicating.

But regardless, the terms are 3^k /2^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s check if that converges. Take the ratio of term k+1 over term k: (3^{k+1}/2^{2^{k+1}}}) / (3^k /2^{2^k}}) =3 /2^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 /2^{2^k(2 -1)}=3 /2^{2^k}. As k increases, the denominator is growing exponentially, so the ratio tends to zero. Therefore, by the ratio test, the series converges absolutely for z=1/2. Similarly, if we take |z|=r &lt;1, then |a_k|=3^k r^{2^k}, and the ratio |a_{k+1}| / |a_k| =3 r^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 r^{2^k}. Since r &lt;1, r^{2^k} tends to zero as k increases, so the ratio tends to zero, hence the series converges.

But if |z|=1, then |a_k|=3^k, which tends to infinity, so the series diverges. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k|=3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is even larger, so diverges. Therefore, all tests point to R=1.

Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

**Final Answer**
The radius of convergence is \boxed{1}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of convergence for the power series \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} \), we can use the root test and the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem.

1. **Root Test Approach**:
   - The series is given by \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Each term \( a_k = 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Applying the root test, we consider \( |a_k|^{1/k} = \left( 3^k |z|^{2^k} \right)^{1/k} = 3 |z|^{2^k / k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( 2^k / k \to \infty \). Therefore, if \( |z| &lt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to 0 \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to 0 \), which is less than 1, indicating convergence.
   - If \( |z| &gt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to \infty \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to \infty \), which is greater than 1, indicating divergence.
   - Thus, the series converges for \( |z| &lt; 1 \) and diverges for \( |z| &gt; 1 \).

2. **Cauchy-Hadamard Theorem**:
   - The theorem states \( R = 1 / \limsup_{n \to \infty} |c_n|^{1/n} \), where \( c_n \) are the coefficients of \( z^n \).
   - For our series, \( c_n = 3^k \) if \( n = 2^k \) and 0 otherwise.
   - We compute \( \limsup_{k \to \infty} |c_{2^k}|^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} (3^k)^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} 3^{k/2^k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( k/2^k \to 0 \), so \( 3^{k/2^k} \to 1 \). Hence, \( \limsup |c_n|^{1/n} = 1 \), giving \( R = 1 \).

Both methods confirm that the radius of convergence is \( \boxed{1} \).          </p>

Response: Let&#x27;s plot the first 5 terms of the series to help us decide what \boxed{4}. Note that \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} \) is rapidly approaching the value \( 3 \) as \(z\to 0\), so the series converges at \( z = 0\).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of convergence for this power series: the sum from k=0 to infinity of 3^k times z raised to the 2^k power. Hmm, power series... radius of convergence... right. The radius of convergence is the value R such that the series converges if |z| &lt; R and diverges if |z| &gt; R. Got it.

But wait, this isn&#x27;t a standard power series where the exponents are just n or something. The exponents here are 2^k. So, the powers of z are increasing really quickly. Like, for k=0, it&#x27;s z^1, k=1 is z^2, k=2 is z^4, k=3 is z^8, and so on. So, the exponents are like 2^k instead of k. That&#x27;s different. So, maybe the standard root test or ratio test need some adjustments here?

Let me recall. For a standard power series sum a_n z^n, the radius of convergence R can be found using the root test: 1/R = lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}. But in this case, the exponents are not n, but 2^k. So, the coefficients are 3^k when the exponent is 2^k, and for other exponents, the coefficients are zero. So, the series is sparse, with lots of missing terms. So, maybe writing it in the standard form would involve a lot of zero coefficients. For example, between z^4 and z^8, there are z^5, z^6, z^7 terms missing, all with coefficient zero.

So, if I try to write this as sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n z^n, then c_n is 3^k if n = 2^k for some k, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the coefficients c_n are mostly zero except when n is a power of 2. Then, to compute the radius of convergence using the root test, which is lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So, since most c_n are zero, the lim sup would be the supremum of the limit points of |c_n|^{1/n}. But since the non-zero terms are at n=2^k, we can look at the limit as k approaches infinity of |c_{2^k}|^{1/(2^k)}. Because for n=2^k, c_n =3^k, so |c_n|^{1/n} = (3^k)^{1/(2^k)} = 3^{k / 2^k}. So, the lim sup would be the limit of 3^{k / 2^k} as k approaches infinity. Then, if that limit exists, that would be the value.

But first, let me compute k / 2^k as k approaches infinity. What&#x27;s the limit of k / 2^k? Hmm, as k grows, 2^k grows exponentially, while k grows linearly, so the limit should be zero. Therefore, 3^{k / 2^k} is 3^0 = 1. Therefore, the lim sup is 1, so 1/R =1, so R=1. Wait, so does that mean the radius of convergence is 1? But let me verify that again.

Wait, hold on. The root test for power series says that R = 1 / lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So here, the lim sup is 1, so R=1. But let me check with the ratio test as well, maybe. Although, ratio test is usually for when the terms are non-zero and you can take the ratio of consecutive terms. But here, the problem is that the terms are not consecutive. The exponents jump from 2^k to 2^{k+1}, which is doubling each time. So, between z^{2^k} and z^{2^{k+1}}, there are a lot of terms missing. So, maybe the ratio test isn&#x27;t directly applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the root test as applied to the series terms. The root test for the series convergence says that the series converges absolutely if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt; 1. Wait, but here the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}. So, each term is a_k = 3^k z^{2^k}. So, if I consider the lim sup of |a_k|^{1/k} = lim sup |3^k z^{2^k}|^{1/k} = lim sup (3 |z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = 3^{1/k} |z|^{2^k / k}.

So, as k approaches infinity, 3^{1/k} tends to 1, and |z|^{2^k / k}. Now, if |z| &lt; 1, then |z|^{2^k / k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k}. Since |z| &lt;1, |z|^{2^k} tends to zero as k approaches infinity. So, |z|^{2^k / k} = e^{(2^k / k) ln |z|}. Since ln |z| is negative, and 2^k / k tends to infinity, so this exponent tends to negative infinity, hence |z|^{2^k /k} tends to zero. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = 0 &lt;1, so the series converges absolutely.

If |z| =1, then |z|^{2^k / k} =1^{2^k /k}=1, so lim sup |a_k|^{1/k}=1. So, the root test is inconclusive here. Wait, but if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k}. Since |z| &gt;1, |z|^{1/k} = e^{(ln |z|)/k} ≈1 + (ln |z|)/k as k is large. Then, (1 + (ln |z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈ e^{(ln |z|)/k * 2^k} = e^{(ln |z|) 2^k /k}. Since 2^k /k tends to infinity, this exponent tends to infinity, so |z|^{2^k /k} tends to infinity. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = infinity, which is greater than 1, so the series diverges.

Wait, but hold on. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k| = 3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is 3^k times something growing exponentially (since |z|^{2^k} is like e^{2^k ln |z|}, which is exponential in 2^k). So, the terms themselves are going to infinity, so the series diverges. So, in this case, if |z| &gt;1, the terms don&#x27;t even approach zero, so the series diverges.

If |z| =1, then |a_k|=3^k *1^{2^k}=3^k, which tends to infinity, so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero, so the series diverges on |z|=1.

But wait, when |z| &lt;1, we saw that |a_k|^{1/k} tends to zero, so the root test tells us the series converges absolutely. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. But wait, but when I first considered the standard root test for power series (the lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}), I also got R=1. So, that seems consistent.

But let me check another approach. Since the exponents are 2^k, maybe substituting w = z^2 or something. Wait, but the exponents are 2^k, which is doubling each time. So, for k=0: 1, k=1:2, k=2:4, k=3:8, etc. So, the exponents are 2^k. So, the series can be written as sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}.

Alternatively, think of this as a lacunary series. I remember that lacunary series have gaps between exponents, and their convergence can be tricky. But maybe in this case, since the gaps are increasing exponentially, maybe the radius of convergence is still 1. But let me see.

Alternatively, suppose we use the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem. The theorem states that the radius of convergence R is given by 1 / lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}, where a_n is the coefficient of z^n. But in our case, as mentioned before, a_n is 3^k when n=2^k, otherwise 0. So, the lim sup is the supremum of all limit points of |a_n|^{1/n}. The non-zero terms are at n=2^k, so we need to compute lim sup_{n-&gt;infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} |3^k|^{1/2^k} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} 3^{k/2^k}.

As k approaches infinity, k/2^k approaches 0, as 2^k grows exponentially. Therefore, 3^{k/2^k} = e^{(k/2^k) ln 3} tends to e^0 =1. Therefore, lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}=1, so R=1/1=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. So, that&#x27;s the same answer as before.

Alternatively, if I use the root test on the series terms. For a general series sum a_k, the root test says that if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt;1, then converges absolutely; if &gt;1, diverges. Here, the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}, so each term a_k =3^k z^{2^k}. So, |a_k|^{1/k} = (3^k |z|^{2^k})^{1/k}=3 |z|^{2^k /k}. Now, as k approaches infinity, 2^k /k tends to infinity, so if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k} ≈(1 + (ln|z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈e^{(ln|z|)/k *2^k}=e^{(ln|z|) 2^k /k} which tends to infinity. Therefore, |a_k|^{1/k} tends to infinity. If |z| &lt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} tends to 0, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*0=0. If |z|=1, then |z|^{2^k /k}=1, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*1=3 &gt;1. Therefore, by the root test for series, the series converges absolutely when |z| &lt;1, diverges when |z| &gt;=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

So, both methods, the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem applied to the power series coefficients, and the root test applied to the series terms, give R=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

But let me just verify with a specific example. Take z=1/2. Then the series becomes sum 3^k (1/2)^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s compute the terms. For k=0: 1*(1/2)^1=1/2. k=1:3*(1/2)^2=3/4. k=2:9*(1/2)^4=9/16. k=3:27*(1/2)^8=27/256. k=4:81*(1/2)^16=81/65536. So, the terms are 1/2, 3/4, 9/16, 27/256, 81/65536,... Each term is (3/4)^k. Wait, but (3/4)^k? Wait, 3^k over 2^{2^k}. So, 3^k /4^{2^{k-1}}? Hmm, maybe not. Let&#x27;s see: for k=0: 3^0 /2^{2^0}=1/2. k=1:3/4. k=2:9/16. k=3:27/256. So, the denominators are 2, 4, 16, 256,... which is 2^{1}, 2^{2}, 2^{4}, 2^{8}, etc. So, denominator is 2^{2^k}. Therefore, each term is (3/4)^k * (1/2)^{2^k - 2^{k-1}}}? Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s overcomplicating.

But regardless, the terms are 3^k /2^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s check if that converges. Take the ratio of term k+1 over term k: (3^{k+1}/2^{2^{k+1}}}) / (3^k /2^{2^k}}) =3 /2^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 /2^{2^k(2 -1)}=3 /2^{2^k}. As k increases, the denominator is growing exponentially, so the ratio tends to zero. Therefore, by the ratio test, the series converges absolutely for z=1/2. Similarly, if we take |z|=r &lt;1, then |a_k|=3^k r^{2^k}, and the ratio |a_{k+1}| / |a_k| =3 r^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 r^{2^k}. Since r &lt;1, r^{2^k} tends to zero as k increases, so the ratio tends to zero, hence the series converges.

But if |z|=1, then |a_k|=3^k, which tends to infinity, so the series diverges. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k|=3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is even larger, so diverges. Therefore, all tests point to R=1.

Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

**Final Answer**
The radius of convergence is \boxed{1}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of convergence for the power series \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} \), we can use the root test and the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem.

1. **Root Test Approach**:
   - The series is given by \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Each term \( a_k = 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Applying the root test, we consider \( |a_k|^{1/k} = \left( 3^k |z|^{2^k} \right)^{1/k} = 3 |z|^{2^k / k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( 2^k / k \to \infty \). Therefore, if \( |z| &lt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to 0 \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to 0 \), which is less than 1, indicating convergence.
   - If \( |z| &gt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to \infty \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to \infty \), which is greater than 1, indicating divergence.
   - Thus, the series converges for \( |z| &lt; 1 \) and diverges for \( |z| &gt; 1 \).

2. **Cauchy-Hadamard Theorem**:
   - The theorem states \( R = 1 / \limsup_{n \to \infty} |c_n|^{1/n} \), where \( c_n \) are the coefficients of \( z^n \).
   - For our series, \( c_n = 3^k \) if \( n = 2^k \) and 0 otherwise.
   - We compute \( \limsup_{k \to \infty} |c_{2^k}|^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} (3^k)^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} 3^{k/2^k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( k/2^k \to 0 \), so \( 3^{k/2^k} \to 1 \). Hence, \( \limsup |c_n|^{1/n} = 1 \), giving \( R = 1 \).

Both methods confirm that the radius of convergence is \( \boxed{1} \).          </p>

Let me recall. For a standard power series sum a_n z^n, the radius of convergence R can be found using the root test: 1/R = lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}. But in this case, the exponents are not n, but 2^k.

So, maybe writing it in the standard form would involve a lot of zero coefficients. For example, between z^4 and z^8, there are z^5, z^6, z^7 terms missing, all with coefficient zero.

So, if I try to write this as sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n z^n, then c_n is 3^k if n = 2^k for some k, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the coefficients c_n are mostly zero except when n is a power of 2. Then, to compute the radius of convergence using the root test, which is lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So, since most c_n are zero, the lim sup would be the supremum of the limit points of |c_n|^{1/n}. But since the non-zero terms are at n=2^k, we can look at the limit as k approaches infinity of |c_{2^k}|^{1/(2^k)}. Because for n=2^k, c_n =3^k, so |c_n|^{1/n} = (3^k)^{1/(2^k)} = 3^{k / 2^k}. So, the lim sup would be the limit of 3^{k / 2^k} as k approaches infinity. Then, if that limit exists, that would be the value.

But first, let me compute k / 2^k as k approaches infinity. What&#x27;s the limit of k / 2^k? Hmm, as k grows, 2^k grows exponentially, while k grows linearly, so the limit should be zero. Therefore, 3^{k / 2^k} is 3^0 = 1. Therefore, the lim sup is 1, so 1/R =1, so R=1. Wait, so does that mean the radius of convergence is 1? But let me verify that again.

Wait, hold on. The root test for power series says that R = 1 / lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So here, the lim sup is 1, so R=1. But let me check with the ratio test as well, maybe. Although, ratio test is usually for when the terms are non-zero and you can take the ratio of consecutive terms. But here, the problem is that the terms are not consecutive.

Wait, but here the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}. So, each term is a_k = 3^k z^{2^k}. So, if I consider the lim sup of |a_k|^{1/k} = lim sup |3^k z^{2^k}|^{1/k} = lim sup (3 |z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = 3^{1/k} |z|^{2^k / k}.

So, as k approaches infinity, 3^{1/k} tends to 1, and |z|^{2^k / k}. Now, if |z| &lt; 1, then |z|^{2^k / k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k}. Since |z| &lt;1, |z|^{2^k} tends to zero as k approaches infinity. So, |z|^{2^k / k} = e^{(2^k / k) ln |z|}. Since ln |z| is negative, and 2^k / k tends to infinity, so this exponent tends to negative infinity, hence |z|^{2^k /k} tends to zero. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = 0 &lt;1, so the series converges absolutely.

If |z| =1, then |z|^{2^k / k} =1^{2^k /k}=1, so lim sup |a_k|^{1/k}=1. So, the root test is inconclusive here. Wait, but if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k}. Since |z| &gt;1, |z|^{1/k} = e^{(ln |z|)/k} ≈1 + (ln |z|)/k as k is large. Then, (1 + (ln |z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈ e^{(ln |z|)/k * 2^k} = e^{(ln |z|) 2^k /k}. Since 2^k /k tends to infinity, this exponent tends to infinity, so |z|^{2^k /k} tends to infinity. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = infinity, which is greater than 1, so the series diverges.

Wait, but hold on. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k| = 3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is 3^k times something growing exponentially (since |z|^{2^k} is like e^{2^k ln |z|}, which is exponential in 2^k). So, the terms themselves are going to infinity, so the series diverges. So, in this case, if |z| &gt;1, the terms don&#x27;t even approach zero, so the series diverges.

If |z| =1, then |a_k|=3^k *1^{2^k}=3^k, which tends to infinity, so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero, so the series diverges on |z|=1.

But wait, when |z| &lt;1, we saw that |a_k|^{1/k} tends to zero, so the root test tells us the series converges absolutely. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. But wait, but when I first considered the standard root test for power series (the lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}), I also got R=1. So, that seems consistent.

But let me check another approach. Since the exponents are 2^k, maybe substituting w = z^2 or something. Wait, but the exponents are 2^k, which is doubling each time. So, for k=0: 1, k=1:2, k=2:4, k=3:8, etc. So, the exponents are 2^k. So, the series can be written as sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}.

Alternatively, think of this as a lacunary series. I remember that lacunary series have gaps between exponents, and their convergence can be tricky. But maybe in this case, since the gaps are increasing exponentially, maybe the radius of convergence is still 1. But let me see.

Alternatively, suppose we use the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem. The theorem states that the radius of convergence R is given by 1 / lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}, where a_n is the coefficient of z^n. But in our case, as mentioned before, a_n is 3^k when n=2^k, otherwise 0. So, the lim sup is the supremum of all limit points of |a_n|^{1/n}. The non-zero terms are at n=2^k, so we need to compute lim sup_{n-&gt;infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} |3^k|^{1/2^k} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} 3^{k/2^k}.

As k approaches infinity, k/2^k approaches 0, as 2^k grows exponentially. Therefore, 3^{k/2^k} = e^{(k/2^k) ln 3} tends to e^0 =1. Therefore, lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}=1, so R=1/1=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. So, that&#x27;s the same answer as before.

Alternatively, if I use the root test on the series terms. For a general series sum a_k, the root test says that if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt;1, then converges absolutely; if &gt;1, diverges. Here, the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}, so each term a_k =3^k z^{2^k}. So, |a_k|^{1/k} = (3^k |z|^{2^k})^{1/k}=3 |z|^{2^k /k}. Now, as k approaches infinity, 2^k /k tends to infinity, so if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k} ≈(1 + (ln|z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈e^{(ln|z|)/k *2^k}=e^{(ln|z|) 2^k /k} which tends to infinity. Therefore, |a_k|^{1/k} tends to infinity. If |z| &lt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} tends to 0, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*0=0. If |z|=1, then |z|^{2^k /k}=1, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*1=3 &gt;1. Therefore, by the root test for series, the series converges absolutely when |z| &lt;1, diverges when |z| &gt;=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

So, both methods, the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem applied to the power series coefficients, and the root test applied to the series terms, give R=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

But let me just verify with a specific example. Take z=1/2. Then the series becomes sum 3^k (1/2)^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s compute the terms. For k=0: 1*(1/2)^1=1/2. k=1:3*(1/2)^2=3/4. k=2:9*(1/2)^4=9/16. k=3:27*(1/2)^8=27/256. k=4:81*(1/2)^16=81/65536. So, the terms are 1/2, 3/4, 9/16, 27/256, 81/65536,... Each term is (3/4)^k. Wait, but (3/4)^k? Wait, 3^k over 2^{2^k}. So, 3^k /4^{2^{k-1}}? Hmm, maybe not. Let&#x27;s see: for k=0: 3^0 /2^{2^0}=1/2. k=1:3/4. k=2:9/16. k=3:27/256. So, the denominators are 2, 4, 16, 256,... which is 2^{1}, 2^{2}, 2^{4}, 2^{8}, etc. So, denominator is 2^{2^k}. Therefore, each term is (3/4)^k * (1/2)^{2^k - 2^{k-1}}}? Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s overcomplicating.

But regardless, the terms are 3^k /2^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s check if that converges. Take the ratio of term k+1 over term k: (3^{k+1}/2^{2^{k+1}}}) / (3^k /2^{2^k}}) =3 /2^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 /2^{2^k(2 -1)}=3 /2^{2^k}. As k increases, the denominator is growing exponentially, so the ratio tends to zero. Therefore, by the ratio test, the series converges absolutely for z=1/2. Similarly, if we take |z|=r &lt;1, then |a_k|=3^k r^{2^k}, and the ratio |a_{k+1}| / |a_k| =3 r^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 r^{2^k}. Since r &lt;1, r^{2^k} tends to zero as k increases, so the ratio tends to zero, hence the series converges.

But if |z|=1, then |a_k|=3^k, which tends to infinity, so the series diverges. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k|=3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is even larger, so diverges. Therefore, all tests point to R=1.

Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

**Final Answer**
The radius of convergence is \boxed{1}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of convergence for the power series \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} \), we can use the root test and the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem.

1. **Root Test Approach**:
   - The series is given by \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Each term \( a_k = 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Applying the root test, we consider \( |a_k|^{1/k} = \left( 3^k |z|^{2^k} \right)^{1/k} = 3 |z|^{2^k / k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( 2^k / k \to \infty \). Therefore, if \( |z| &lt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to 0 \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to 0 \), which is less than 1, indicating convergence.
   - If \( |z| &gt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to \infty \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to \infty \), which is greater than 1, indicating divergence.
   - Thus, the series converges for \( |z| &lt; 1 \) and diverges for \( |z| &gt; 1 \).

2. **Cauchy-Hadamard Theorem**:
   - The theorem states \( R = 1 / \limsup_{n \to \infty} |c_n|^{1/n} \), where \( c_n \) are the coefficients of \( z^n \).
   - For our series, \( c_n = 3^k \) if \( n = 2^k \) and 0 otherwise.
   - We compute \( \limsup_{k \to \infty} |c_{2^k}|^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} (3^k)^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} 3^{k/2^k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( k/2^k \to 0 \), so \( 3^{k/2^k} \to 1 \). Hence, \( \limsup |c_n|^{1/n} = 1 \), giving \( R = 1 \).

Both methods confirm that the radius of convergence is \( \boxed{1} \).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of convergence for this power series: the sum from k=0 to infinity of 3^k times z raised to the 2^k power. Hmm, power series... radius of convergence... right. The radius of convergence is the value R such that the series converges if |z| &lt; R and diverges if |z| &gt; R. Got it.

But wait, this isn&#x27;t a standard power series where the exponents are just n or something. The exponents here are 2^k. So, the powers of z are increasing really quickly. Like, for k=0, it&#x27;s z^1, k=1 is z^2, k=2 is z^4, k=3 is z^8, and so on. So, the exponents are like 2^k instead of k. That&#x27;s different. So, maybe the standard root test or ratio test need some adjustments here?

Let me recall. For a standard power series sum a_n z^n, the radius of convergence R can be found using the root test: 1/R = lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}. But in this case, the exponents are not n, but 2^k. So, the coefficients are 3^k when the exponent is 2^k, and for other exponents, the coefficients are zero. So, the series is sparse, with lots of missing terms. So, maybe writing it in the standard form would involve a lot of zero coefficients. For example, between z^4 and z^8, there are z^5, z^6, z^7 terms missing, all with coefficient zero.

So, if I try to write this as sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n z^n, then c_n is 3^k if n = 2^k for some k, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the coefficients c_n are mostly zero except when n is a power of 2. Then, to compute the radius of convergence using the root test, which is lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So, since most c_n are zero, the lim sup would be the supremum of the limit points of |c_n|^{1/n}. But since the non-zero terms are at n=2^k, we can look at the limit as k approaches infinity of |c_{2^k}|^{1/(2^k)}. Because for n=2^k, c_n =3^k, so |c_n|^{1/n} = (3^k)^{1/(2^k)} = 3^{k / 2^k}. So, the lim sup would be the limit of 3^{k / 2^k} as k approaches infinity. Then, if that limit exists, that would be the value.

But first, let me compute k / 2^k as k approaches infinity. What&#x27;s the limit of k / 2^k? Hmm, as k grows, 2^k grows exponentially, while k grows linearly, so the limit should be zero. Therefore, 3^{k / 2^k} is 3^0 = 1. Therefore, the lim sup is 1, so 1/R =1, so R=1. Wait, so does that mean the radius of convergence is 1? But let me verify that again.

Wait, hold on. The root test for power series says that R = 1 / lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So here, the lim sup is 1, so R=1. But let me check with the ratio test as well, maybe. Although, ratio test is usually for when the terms are non-zero and you can take the ratio of consecutive terms. But here, the problem is that the terms are not consecutive. The exponents jump from 2^k to 2^{k+1}, which is doubling each time. So, between z^{2^k} and z^{2^{k+1}}, there are a lot of terms missing. So, maybe the ratio test isn&#x27;t directly applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the root test as applied to the series terms. The root test for the series convergence says that the series converges absolutely if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt; 1. Wait, but here the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}. So, each term is a_k = 3^k z^{2^k}. So, if I consider the lim sup of |a_k|^{1/k} = lim sup |3^k z^{2^k}|^{1/k} = lim sup (3 |z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = 3^{1/k} |z|^{2^k / k}.

So, as k approaches infinity, 3^{1/k} tends to 1, and |z|^{2^k / k}. Now, if |z| &lt; 1, then |z|^{2^k / k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k}. Since |z| &lt;1, |z|^{2^k} tends to zero as k approaches infinity. So, |z|^{2^k / k} = e^{(2^k / k) ln |z|}. Since ln |z| is negative, and 2^k / k tends to infinity, so this exponent tends to negative infinity, hence |z|^{2^k /k} tends to zero. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = 0 &lt;1, so the series converges absolutely.

If |z| =1, then |z|^{2^k / k} =1^{2^k /k}=1, so lim sup |a_k|^{1/k}=1. So, the root test is inconclusive here. Wait, but if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k}. Since |z| &gt;1, |z|^{1/k} = e^{(ln |z|)/k} ≈1 + (ln |z|)/k as k is large. Then, (1 + (ln |z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈ e^{(ln |z|)/k * 2^k} = e^{(ln |z|) 2^k /k}. Since 2^k /k tends to infinity, this exponent tends to infinity, so |z|^{2^k /k} tends to infinity. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = infinity, which is greater than 1, so the series diverges.

Wait, but hold on. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k| = 3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is 3^k times something growing exponentially (since |z|^{2^k} is like e^{2^k ln |z|}, which is exponential in 2^k). So, the terms themselves are going to infinity, so the series diverges. So, in this case, if |z| &gt;1, the terms don&#x27;t even approach zero, so the series diverges.

If |z| =1, then |a_k|=3^k *1^{2^k}=3^k, which tends to infinity, so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero, so the series diverges on |z|=1.

But wait, when |z| &lt;1, we saw that |a_k|^{1/k} tends to zero, so the root test tells us the series converges absolutely. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. But wait, but when I first considered the standard root test for power series (the lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}), I also got R=1. So, that seems consistent.

But let me check another approach. Since the exponents are 2^k, maybe substituting w = z^2 or something. Wait, but the exponents are 2^k, which is doubling each time. So, for k=0: 1, k=1:2, k=2:4, k=3:8, etc. So, the exponents are 2^k. So, the series can be written as sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}.

Alternatively, think of this as a lacunary series. I remember that lacunary series have gaps between exponents, and their convergence can be tricky. But maybe in this case, since the gaps are increasing exponentially, maybe the radius of convergence is still 1. But let me see.

Alternatively, suppose we use the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem. The theorem states that the radius of convergence R is given by 1 / lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}, where a_n is the coefficient of z^n. But in our case, as mentioned before, a_n is 3^k when n=2^k, otherwise 0. So, the lim sup is the supremum of all limit points of |a_n|^{1/n}. The non-zero terms are at n=2^k, so we need to compute lim sup_{n-&gt;infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} |3^k|^{1/2^k} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} 3^{k/2^k}.

As k approaches infinity, k/2^k approaches 0, as 2^k grows exponentially. Therefore, 3^{k/2^k} = e^{(k/2^k) ln 3} tends to e^0 =1. Therefore, lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}=1, so R=1/1=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. So, that&#x27;s the same answer as before.

Alternatively, if I use the root test on the series terms. For a general series sum a_k, the root test says that if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt;1, then converges absolutely; if &gt;1, diverges. Here, the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}, so each term a_k =3^k z^{2^k}. So, |a_k|^{1/k} = (3^k |z|^{2^k})^{1/k}=3 |z|^{2^k /k}. Now, as k approaches infinity, 2^k /k tends to infinity, so if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k} ≈(1 + (ln|z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈e^{(ln|z|)/k *2^k}=e^{(ln|z|) 2^k /k} which tends to infinity. Therefore, |a_k|^{1/k} tends to infinity. If |z| &lt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} tends to 0, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*0=0. If |z|=1, then |z|^{2^k /k}=1, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*1=3 &gt;1. Therefore, by the root test for series, the series converges absolutely when |z| &lt;1, diverges when |z| &gt;=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

So, both methods, the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem applied to the power series coefficients, and the root test applied to the series terms, give R=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

But let me just verify with a specific example. Take z=1/2. Then the series becomes sum 3^k (1/2)^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s compute the terms. For k=0: 1*(1/2)^1=1/2. k=1:3*(1/2)^2=3/4. k=2:9*(1/2)^4=9/16. k=3:27*(1/2)^8=27/256. k=4:81*(1/2)^16=81/65536. So, the terms are 1/2, 3/4, 9/16, 27/256, 81/65536,... Each term is (3/4)^k. Wait, but (3/4)^k? Wait, 3^k over 2^{2^k}. So, 3^k /4^{2^{k-1}}? Hmm, maybe not. Let&#x27;s see: for k=0: 3^0 /2^{2^0}=1/2. k=1:3/4. k=2:9/16. k=3:27/256. So, the denominators are 2, 4, 16, 256,... which is 2^{1}, 2^{2}, 2^{4}, 2^{8}, etc. So, denominator is 2^{2^k}. Therefore, each term is (3/4)^k * (1/2)^{2^k - 2^{k-1}}}? Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s overcomplicating.

But regardless, the terms are 3^k /2^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s check if that converges. Take the ratio of term k+1 over term k: (3^{k+1}/2^{2^{k+1}}}) / (3^k /2^{2^k}}) =3 /2^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 /2^{2^k(2 -1)}=3 /2^{2^k}. As k increases, the denominator is growing exponentially, so the ratio tends to zero. Therefore, by the ratio test, the series converges absolutely for z=1/2. Similarly, if we take |z|=r &lt;1, then |a_k|=3^k r^{2^k}, and the ratio |a_{k+1}| / |a_k| =3 r^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 r^{2^k}. Since r &lt;1, r^{2^k} tends to zero as k increases, so the ratio tends to zero, hence the series converges.

But if |z|=1, then |a_k|=3^k, which tends to infinity, so the series diverges. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k|=3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is even larger, so diverges. Therefore, all tests point to R=1.

Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

**Final Answer**
The radius of convergence is \boxed{1}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of convergence for the power series \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} \), we can use the root test and the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem.

1. **Root Test Approach**:
   - The series is given by \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Each term \( a_k = 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Applying the root test, we consider \( |a_k|^{1/k} = \left( 3^k |z|^{2^k} \right)^{1/k} = 3 |z|^{2^k / k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( 2^k / k \to \infty \). Therefore, if \( |z| &lt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to 0 \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to 0 \), which is less than 1, indicating convergence.
   - If \( |z| &gt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to \infty \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to \infty \), which is greater than 1, indicating divergence.
   - Thus, the series converges for \( |z| &lt; 1 \) and diverges for \( |z| &gt; 1 \).

2. **Cauchy-Hadamard Theorem**:
   - The theorem states \( R = 1 / \limsup_{n \to \infty} |c_n|^{1/n} \), where \( c_n \) are the coefficients of \( z^n \).
   - For our series, \( c_n = 3^k \) if \( n = 2^k \) and 0 otherwise.
   - We compute \( \limsup_{k \to \infty} |c_{2^k}|^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} (3^k)^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} 3^{k/2^k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( k/2^k \to 0 \), so \( 3^{k/2^k} \to 1 \). Hence, \( \limsup |c_n|^{1/n} = 1 \), giving \( R = 1 \).

Both methods confirm that the radius of convergence is \( \boxed{1} \).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of convergence for this power series: the sum from k=0 to infinity of 3^k times z raised to the 2^k power. Hmm, power series... radius of convergence... right. The radius of convergence is the value R such that the series converges if |z| &lt; R and diverges if |z| &gt; R. Got it.

But wait, this isn&#x27;t a standard power series where the exponents are just n or something. The exponents here are 2^k. So, the powers of z are increasing really quickly. Like, for k=0, it&#x27;s z^1, k=1 is z^2, k=2 is z^4, k=3 is z^8, and so on. So, the exponents are like 2^k instead of k. That&#x27;s different. So, maybe the standard root test or ratio test need some adjustments here?

Let me recall. For a standard power series sum a_n z^n, the radius of convergence R can be found using the root test: 1/R = lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}. But in this case, the exponents are not n, but 2^k. So, the coefficients are 3^k when the exponent is 2^k, and for other exponents, the coefficients are zero. So, the series is sparse, with lots of missing terms. So, maybe writing it in the standard form would involve a lot of zero coefficients. For example, between z^4 and z^8, there are z^5, z^6, z^7 terms missing, all with coefficient zero.

So, if I try to write this as sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n z^n, then c_n is 3^k if n = 2^k for some k, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the coefficients c_n are mostly zero except when n is a power of 2. Then, to compute the radius of convergence using the root test, which is lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So, since most c_n are zero, the lim sup would be the supremum of the limit points of |c_n|^{1/n}. But since the non-zero terms are at n=2^k, we can look at the limit as k approaches infinity of |c_{2^k}|^{1/(2^k)}. Because for n=2^k, c_n =3^k, so |c_n|^{1/n} = (3^k)^{1/(2^k)} = 3^{k / 2^k}. So, the lim sup would be the limit of 3^{k / 2^k} as k approaches infinity. Then, if that limit exists, that would be the value.

But first, let me compute k / 2^k as k approaches infinity. What&#x27;s the limit of k / 2^k? Hmm, as k grows, 2^k grows exponentially, while k grows linearly, so the limit should be zero. Therefore, 3^{k / 2^k} is 3^0 = 1. Therefore, the lim sup is 1, so 1/R =1, so R=1. Wait, so does that mean the radius of convergence is 1? But let me verify that again.

Wait, hold on. The root test for power series says that R = 1 / lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So here, the lim sup is 1, so R=1. But let me check with the ratio test as well, maybe. Although, ratio test is usually for when the terms are non-zero and you can take the ratio of consecutive terms. But here, the problem is that the terms are not consecutive. The exponents jump from 2^k to 2^{k+1}, which is doubling each time. So, between z^{2^k} and z^{2^{k+1}}, there are a lot of terms missing. So, maybe the ratio test isn&#x27;t directly applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the root test as applied to the series terms. The root test for the series convergence says that the series converges absolutely if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt; 1. Wait, but here the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}. So, each term is a_k = 3^k z^{2^k}. So, if I consider the lim sup of |a_k|^{1/k} = lim sup |3^k z^{2^k}|^{1/k} = lim sup (3 |z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = 3^{1/k} |z|^{2^k / k}.

So, as k approaches infinity, 3^{1/k} tends to 1, and |z|^{2^k / k}. Now, if |z| &lt; 1, then |z|^{2^k / k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k}. Since |z| &lt;1, |z|^{2^k} tends to zero as k approaches infinity. So, |z|^{2^k / k} = e^{(2^k / k) ln |z|}. Since ln |z| is negative, and 2^k / k tends to infinity, so this exponent tends to negative infinity, hence |z|^{2^k /k} tends to zero. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = 0 &lt;1, so the series converges absolutely.

If |z| =1, then |z|^{2^k / k} =1^{2^k /k}=1, so lim sup |a_k|^{1/k}=1. So, the root test is inconclusive here. Wait, but if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k}. Since |z| &gt;1, |z|^{1/k} = e^{(ln |z|)/k} ≈1 + (ln |z|)/k as k is large. Then, (1 + (ln |z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈ e^{(ln |z|)/k * 2^k} = e^{(ln |z|) 2^k /k}. Since 2^k /k tends to infinity, this exponent tends to infinity, so |z|^{2^k /k} tends to infinity. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = infinity, which is greater than 1, so the series diverges.

Wait, but hold on. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k| = 3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is 3^k times something growing exponentially (since |z|^{2^k} is like e^{2^k ln |z|}, which is exponential in 2^k). So, the terms themselves are going to infinity, so the series diverges. So, in this case, if |z| &gt;1, the terms don&#x27;t even approach zero, so the series diverges.

If |z| =1, then |a_k|=3^k *1^{2^k}=3^k, which tends to infinity, so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero, so the series diverges on |z|=1.

But wait, when |z| &lt;1, we saw that |a_k|^{1/k} tends to zero, so the root test tells us the series converges absolutely. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. But wait, but when I first considered the standard root test for power series (the lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}), I also got R=1. So, that seems consistent.

But let me check another approach. Since the exponents are 2^k, maybe substituting w = z^2 or something. Wait, but the exponents are 2^k, which is doubling each time. So, for k=0: 1, k=1:2, k=2:4, k=3:8, etc. So, the exponents are 2^k. So, the series can be written as sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}.

Alternatively, think of this as a lacunary series. I remember that lacunary series have gaps between exponents, and their convergence can be tricky. But maybe in this case, since the gaps are increasing exponentially, maybe the radius of convergence is still 1. But let me see.

Alternatively, suppose we use the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem. The theorem states that the radius of convergence R is given by 1 / lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}, where a_n is the coefficient of z^n. But in our case, as mentioned before, a_n is 3^k when n=2^k, otherwise 0. So, the lim sup is the supremum of all limit points of |a_n|^{1/n}. The non-zero terms are at n=2^k, so we need to compute lim sup_{n-&gt;infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} |3^k|^{1/2^k} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} 3^{k/2^k}.

As k approaches infinity, k/2^k approaches 0, as 2^k grows exponentially. Therefore, 3^{k/2^k} = e^{(k/2^k) ln 3} tends to e^0 =1. Therefore, lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}=1, so R=1/1=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. So, that&#x27;s the same answer as before.

Alternatively, if I use the root test on the series terms. For a general series sum a_k, the root test says that if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt;1, then converges absolutely; if &gt;1, diverges. Here, the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}, so each term a_k =3^k z^{2^k}. So, |a_k|^{1/k} = (3^k |z|^{2^k})^{1/k}=3 |z|^{2^k /k}. Now, as k approaches infinity, 2^k /k tends to infinity, so if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k} ≈(1 + (ln|z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈e^{(ln|z|)/k *2^k}=e^{(ln|z|) 2^k /k} which tends to infinity. Therefore, |a_k|^{1/k} tends to infinity. If |z| &lt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} tends to 0, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*0=0. If |z|=1, then |z|^{2^k /k}=1, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*1=3 &gt;1. Therefore, by the root test for series, the series converges absolutely when |z| &lt;1, diverges when |z| &gt;=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

So, both methods, the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem applied to the power series coefficients, and the root test applied to the series terms, give R=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

But let me just verify with a specific example. Take z=1/2. Then the series becomes sum 3^k (1/2)^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s compute the terms. For k=0: 1*(1/2)^1=1/2. k=1:3*(1/2)^2=3/4. k=2:9*(1/2)^4=9/16. k=3:27*(1/2)^8=27/256. k=4:81*(1/2)^16=81/65536. So, the terms are 1/2, 3/4, 9/16, 27/256, 81/65536,... Each term is (3/4)^k. Wait, but (3/4)^k? Wait, 3^k over 2^{2^k}. So, 3^k /4^{2^{k-1}}? Hmm, maybe not. Let&#x27;s see: for k=0: 3^0 /2^{2^0}=1/2. k=1:3/4. k=2:9/16. k=3:27/256. So, the denominators are 2, 4, 16, 256,... which is 2^{1}, 2^{2}, 2^{4}, 2^{8}, etc. So, denominator is 2^{2^k}. Therefore, each term is (3/4)^k * (1/2)^{2^k - 2^{k-1}}}? Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s overcomplicating.

But regardless, the terms are 3^k /2^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s check if that converges. Take the ratio of term k+1 over term k: (3^{k+1}/2^{2^{k+1}}}) / (3^k /2^{2^k}}) =3 /2^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 /2^{2^k(2 -1)}=3 /2^{2^k}. As k increases, the denominator is growing exponentially, so the ratio tends to zero. Therefore, by the ratio test, the series converges absolutely for z=1/2. Similarly, if we take |z|=r &lt;1, then |a_k|=3^k r^{2^k}, and the ratio |a_{k+1}| / |a_k| =3 r^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 r^{2^k}. Since r &lt;1, r^{2^k} tends to zero as k increases, so the ratio tends to zero, hence the series converges.

But if |z|=1, then |a_k|=3^k, which tends to infinity, so the series diverges. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k|=3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is even larger, so diverges. Therefore, all tests point to R=1.

Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

**Final Answer**
The radius of convergence is \boxed{1}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of convergence for the power series \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} \), we can use the root test and the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem.

1. **Root Test Approach**:
   - The series is given by \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Each term \( a_k = 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Applying the root test, we consider \( |a_k|^{1/k} = \left( 3^k |z|^{2^k} \right)^{1/k} = 3 |z|^{2^k / k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( 2^k / k \to \infty \). Therefore, if \( |z| &lt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to 0 \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to 0 \), which is less than 1, indicating convergence.
   - If \( |z| &gt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to \infty \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to \infty \), which is greater than 1, indicating divergence.
   - Thus, the series converges for \( |z| &lt; 1 \) and diverges for \( |z| &gt; 1 \).

2. **Cauchy-Hadamard Theorem**:
   - The theorem states \( R = 1 / \limsup_{n \to \infty} |c_n|^{1/n} \), where \( c_n \) are the coefficients of \( z^n \).
   - For our series, \( c_n = 3^k \) if \( n = 2^k \) and 0 otherwise.
   - We compute \( \limsup_{k \to \infty} |c_{2^k}|^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} (3^k)^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} 3^{k/2^k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( k/2^k \to 0 \), so \( 3^{k/2^k} \to 1 \). Hence, \( \limsup |c_n|^{1/n} = 1 \), giving \( R = 1 \).

Both methods confirm that the radius of convergence is \( \boxed{1} \).          </p>

So, maybe the standard root test or ratio test need some adjustments here?

Let me recall. For a standard power series sum a_n z^n, the radius of convergence R can be found using the root test: 1/R = lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}. But in this case, the exponents are not n, but 2^k. So, the coefficients are 3^k when the exponent is 2^k, and for other exponents, the coefficients are zero. So, the series is sparse, with lots of missing terms. So, maybe writing it in the standard form would involve a lot of zero coefficients. For example, between z^4 and z^8, there are z^5, z^6, z^7 terms missing, all with coefficient zero.

So, if I try to write this as sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n z^n, then c_n is 3^k if n = 2^k for some k, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the coefficients c_n are mostly zero except when n is a power of 2. Then, to compute the radius of convergence using the root test, which is lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So, since most c_n are zero, the lim sup would be the supremum of the limit points of |c_n|^{1/n}. But since the non-zero terms are at n=2^k, we can look at the limit as k approaches infinity of |c_{2^k}|^{1/(2^k)}. Because for n=2^k, c_n =3^k, so |c_n|^{1/n} = (3^k)^{1/(2^k)} = 3^{k / 2^k}. So, the lim sup would be the limit of 3^{k / 2^k} as k approaches infinity. Then, if that limit exists, that would be the value.

But first, let me compute k / 2^k as k approaches infinity. What&#x27;s the limit of k / 2^k? Hmm, as k grows, 2^k grows exponentially, while k grows linearly, so the limit should be zero. Therefore, 3^{k / 2^k} is 3^0 = 1. Therefore, the lim sup is 1, so 1/R =1, so R=1. Wait, so does that mean the radius of convergence is 1? But let me verify that again.

Wait, hold on. The root test for power series says that R = 1 / lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So here, the lim sup is 1, so R=1. But let me check with the ratio test as well, maybe. Although, ratio test is usually for when the terms are non-zero and you can take the ratio of consecutive terms. But here, the problem is that the terms are not consecutive. The exponents jump from 2^k to 2^{k+1}, which is doubling each time. So, between z^{2^k} and z^{2^{k+1}}, there are a lot of terms missing.

Wait, but here the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}. So, each term is a_k = 3^k z^{2^k}. So, if I consider the lim sup of |a_k|^{1/k} = lim sup |3^k z^{2^k}|^{1/k} = lim sup (3 |z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = 3^{1/k} |z|^{2^k / k}.

So, as k approaches infinity, 3^{1/k} tends to 1, and |z|^{2^k / k}. Now, if |z| &lt; 1, then |z|^{2^k / k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k}. Since |z| &lt;1, |z|^{2^k} tends to zero as k approaches infinity. So, |z|^{2^k / k} = e^{(2^k / k) ln |z|}. Since ln |z| is negative, and 2^k / k tends to infinity, so this exponent tends to negative infinity, hence |z|^{2^k /k} tends to zero. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = 0 &lt;1, so the series converges absolutely.

If |z| =1, then |z|^{2^k / k} =1^{2^k /k}=1, so lim sup |a_k|^{1/k}=1. So, the root test is inconclusive here. Wait, but if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k}. Since |z| &gt;1, |z|^{1/k} = e^{(ln |z|)/k} ≈1 + (ln |z|)/k as k is large. Then, (1 + (ln |z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈ e^{(ln |z|)/k * 2^k} = e^{(ln |z|) 2^k /k}. Since 2^k /k tends to infinity, this exponent tends to infinity, so |z|^{2^k /k} tends to infinity. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = infinity, which is greater than 1, so the series diverges.

Wait, but hold on. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k| = 3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is 3^k times something growing exponentially (since |z|^{2^k} is like e^{2^k ln |z|}, which is exponential in 2^k). So, the terms themselves are going to infinity, so the series diverges. So, in this case, if |z| &gt;1, the terms don&#x27;t even approach zero, so the series diverges.

If |z| =1, then |a_k|=3^k *1^{2^k}=3^k, which tends to infinity, so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero, so the series diverges on |z|=1.

But wait, when |z| &lt;1, we saw that |a_k|^{1/k} tends to zero, so the root test tells us the series converges absolutely. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. But wait, but when I first considered the standard root test for power series (the lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}), I also got R=1. So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, think of this as a lacunary series. I remember that lacunary series have gaps between exponents, and their convergence can be tricky. But maybe in this case, since the gaps are increasing exponentially, maybe the radius of convergence is still 1. But let me see.

Alternatively, suppose we use the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem. The theorem states that the radius of convergence R is given by 1 / lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}, where a_n is the coefficient of z^n. But in our case, as mentioned before, a_n is 3^k when n=2^k, otherwise 0. So, the lim sup is the supremum of all limit points of |a_n|^{1/n}. The non-zero terms are at n=2^k, so we need to compute lim sup_{n-&gt;infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} |3^k|^{1/2^k} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} 3^{k/2^k}.

As k approaches infinity, k/2^k approaches 0, as 2^k grows exponentially. Therefore, 3^{k/2^k} = e^{(k/2^k) ln 3} tends to e^0 =1. Therefore, lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}=1, so R=1/1=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. So, that&#x27;s the same answer as before.

Alternatively, if I use the root test on the series terms. For a general series sum a_k, the root test says that if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt;1, then converges absolutely; if &gt;1, diverges. Here, the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}, so each term a_k =3^k z^{2^k}. So, |a_k|^{1/k} = (3^k |z|^{2^k})^{1/k}=3 |z|^{2^k /k}. Now, as k approaches infinity, 2^k /k tends to infinity, so if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k} ≈(1 + (ln|z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈e^{(ln|z|)/k *2^k}=e^{(ln|z|) 2^k /k} which tends to infinity. Therefore, |a_k|^{1/k} tends to infinity. If |z| &lt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} tends to 0, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*0=0. If |z|=1, then |z|^{2^k /k}=1, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*1=3 &gt;1. Therefore, by the root test for series, the series converges absolutely when |z| &lt;1, diverges when |z| &gt;=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

So, both methods, the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem applied to the power series coefficients, and the root test applied to the series terms, give R=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

But let me just verify with a specific example. Take z=1/2. Then the series becomes sum 3^k (1/2)^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s compute the terms. For k=0: 1*(1/2)^1=1/2. k=1:3*(1/2)^2=3/4. k=2:9*(1/2)^4=9/16. k=3:27*(1/2)^8=27/256. k=4:81*(1/2)^16=81/65536. So, the terms are 1/2, 3/4, 9/16, 27/256, 81/65536,... Each term is (3/4)^k. Wait, but (3/4)^k? Wait, 3^k over 2^{2^k}. So, 3^k /4^{2^{k-1}}? Hmm, maybe not. Let&#x27;s see: for k=0: 3^0 /2^{2^0}=1/2. k=1:3/4. k=2:9/16. k=3:27/256. So, the denominators are 2, 4, 16, 256,... which is 2^{1}, 2^{2}, 2^{4}, 2^{8}, etc. So, denominator is 2^{2^k}. Therefore, each term is (3/4)^k * (1/2)^{2^k - 2^{k-1}}}? Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s overcomplicating.

But regardless, the terms are 3^k /2^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s check if that converges. Take the ratio of term k+1 over term k: (3^{k+1}/2^{2^{k+1}}}) / (3^k /2^{2^k}}) =3 /2^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 /2^{2^k(2 -1)}=3 /2^{2^k}. As k increases, the denominator is growing exponentially, so the ratio tends to zero. Therefore, by the ratio test, the series converges absolutely for z=1/2. Similarly, if we take |z|=r &lt;1, then |a_k|=3^k r^{2^k}, and the ratio |a_{k+1}| / |a_k| =3 r^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 r^{2^k}. Since r &lt;1, r^{2^k} tends to zero as k increases, so the ratio tends to zero, hence the series converges.

But if |z|=1, then |a_k|=3^k, which tends to infinity, so the series diverges. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k|=3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is even larger, so diverges. Therefore, all tests point to R=1.

Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

   - Applying the root test, we consider \( |a_k|^{1/k} = \left( 3^k |z|^{2^k} \right)^{1/k} = 3 |z|^{2^k / k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( 2^k / k \to \infty \). Therefore, if \( |z| &lt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to 0 \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to 0 \), which is less than 1, indicating convergence.
   - If \( |z| &gt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to \infty \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to \infty \), which is greater than 1, indicating divergence.
   - Thus, the series converges for \( |z| &lt; 1 \) and diverges for \( |z| &gt; 1 \).

2. **Cauchy-Hadamard Theorem**:
   - The theorem states \( R = 1 / \limsup_{n \to \infty} |c_n|^{1/n} \), where \( c_n \) are the coefficients of \( z^n \).
   - For our series, \( c_n = 3^k \) if \( n = 2^k \) and 0 otherwise.
   - We compute \( \limsup_{k \to \infty} |c_{2^k}|^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} (3^k)^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} 3^{k/2^k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( k/2^k \to 0 \), so \( 3^{k/2^k} \to 1 \). Hence, \( \limsup |c_n|^{1/n} = 1 \), giving \( R = 1 \).

Both methods confirm that the radius of convergence is \( \boxed{1} \).          </p>

Problem: Determine the radius of convergence for the power series \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} \). Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>

Response: Let&#x27;s figure out if the series converges absolutely. If it doesn&#x27;t, then we can&#x27;t talk about radius of convergence at all. Let&#x27;s plug in z = 1 and notice that we get an infinity. We can do better though - let&#x27;s subtract 1 from both sides. Now the series has the form \(\sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot (1-z)^{2^k} \).

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of convergence for this power series: the sum from k=0 to infinity of 3^k times z raised to the 2^k power. Hmm, power series... radius of convergence... right. The radius of convergence is the value R such that the series converges if |z| &lt; R and diverges if |z| &gt; R. Got it.

But wait, this isn&#x27;t a standard power series where the exponents are just n or something. The exponents here are 2^k. So, the powers of z are increasing really quickly. Like, for k=0, it&#x27;s z^1, k=1 is z^2, k=2 is z^4, k=3 is z^8, and so on. So, the exponents are like 2^k instead of k. That&#x27;s different. So, maybe the standard root test or ratio test need some adjustments here?

Let me recall. For a standard power series sum a_n z^n, the radius of convergence R can be found using the root test: 1/R = lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}. But in this case, the exponents are not n, but 2^k. So, the coefficients are 3^k when the exponent is 2^k, and for other exponents, the coefficients are zero. So, the series is sparse, with lots of missing terms. So, maybe writing it in the standard form would involve a lot of zero coefficients. For example, between z^4 and z^8, there are z^5, z^6, z^7 terms missing, all with coefficient zero.

So, if I try to write this as sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n z^n, then c_n is 3^k if n = 2^k for some k, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the coefficients c_n are mostly zero except when n is a power of 2. Then, to compute the radius of convergence using the root test, which is lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So, since most c_n are zero, the lim sup would be the supremum of the limit points of |c_n|^{1/n}. But since the non-zero terms are at n=2^k, we can look at the limit as k approaches infinity of |c_{2^k}|^{1/(2^k)}. Because for n=2^k, c_n =3^k, so |c_n|^{1/n} = (3^k)^{1/(2^k)} = 3^{k / 2^k}. So, the lim sup would be the limit of 3^{k / 2^k} as k approaches infinity. Then, if that limit exists, that would be the value.

But first, let me compute k / 2^k as k approaches infinity. What&#x27;s the limit of k / 2^k? Hmm, as k grows, 2^k grows exponentially, while k grows linearly, so the limit should be zero. Therefore, 3^{k / 2^k} is 3^0 = 1. Therefore, the lim sup is 1, so 1/R =1, so R=1. Wait, so does that mean the radius of convergence is 1? But let me verify that again.

Wait, hold on. The root test for power series says that R = 1 / lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So here, the lim sup is 1, so R=1. But let me check with the ratio test as well, maybe. Although, ratio test is usually for when the terms are non-zero and you can take the ratio of consecutive terms. But here, the problem is that the terms are not consecutive. The exponents jump from 2^k to 2^{k+1}, which is doubling each time. So, between z^{2^k} and z^{2^{k+1}}, there are a lot of terms missing. So, maybe the ratio test isn&#x27;t directly applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the root test as applied to the series terms. The root test for the series convergence says that the series converges absolutely if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt; 1. Wait, but here the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}. So, each term is a_k = 3^k z^{2^k}. So, if I consider the lim sup of |a_k|^{1/k} = lim sup |3^k z^{2^k}|^{1/k} = lim sup (3 |z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = 3^{1/k} |z|^{2^k / k}.

So, as k approaches infinity, 3^{1/k} tends to 1, and |z|^{2^k / k}. Now, if |z| &lt; 1, then |z|^{2^k / k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k}. Since |z| &lt;1, |z|^{2^k} tends to zero as k approaches infinity. So, |z|^{2^k / k} = e^{(2^k / k) ln |z|}. Since ln |z| is negative, and 2^k / k tends to infinity, so this exponent tends to negative infinity, hence |z|^{2^k /k} tends to zero. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = 0 &lt;1, so the series converges absolutely.

If |z| =1, then |z|^{2^k / k} =1^{2^k /k}=1, so lim sup |a_k|^{1/k}=1. So, the root test is inconclusive here. Wait, but if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k}. Since |z| &gt;1, |z|^{1/k} = e^{(ln |z|)/k} ≈1 + (ln |z|)/k as k is large. Then, (1 + (ln |z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈ e^{(ln |z|)/k * 2^k} = e^{(ln |z|) 2^k /k}. Since 2^k /k tends to infinity, this exponent tends to infinity, so |z|^{2^k /k} tends to infinity. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = infinity, which is greater than 1, so the series diverges.

Wait, but hold on. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k| = 3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is 3^k times something growing exponentially (since |z|^{2^k} is like e^{2^k ln |z|}, which is exponential in 2^k). So, the terms themselves are going to infinity, so the series diverges. So, in this case, if |z| &gt;1, the terms don&#x27;t even approach zero, so the series diverges.

If |z| =1, then |a_k|=3^k *1^{2^k}=3^k, which tends to infinity, so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero, so the series diverges on |z|=1.

But wait, when |z| &lt;1, we saw that |a_k|^{1/k} tends to zero, so the root test tells us the series converges absolutely. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. But wait, but when I first considered the standard root test for power series (the lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}), I also got R=1. So, that seems consistent.

But let me check another approach. Since the exponents are 2^k, maybe substituting w = z^2 or something. Wait, but the exponents are 2^k, which is doubling each time. So, for k=0: 1, k=1:2, k=2:4, k=3:8, etc. So, the exponents are 2^k. So, the series can be written as sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}.

Alternatively, think of this as a lacunary series. I remember that lacunary series have gaps between exponents, and their convergence can be tricky. But maybe in this case, since the gaps are increasing exponentially, maybe the radius of convergence is still 1. But let me see.

Alternatively, suppose we use the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem. The theorem states that the radius of convergence R is given by 1 / lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}, where a_n is the coefficient of z^n. But in our case, as mentioned before, a_n is 3^k when n=2^k, otherwise 0. So, the lim sup is the supremum of all limit points of |a_n|^{1/n}. The non-zero terms are at n=2^k, so we need to compute lim sup_{n-&gt;infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} |3^k|^{1/2^k} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} 3^{k/2^k}.

As k approaches infinity, k/2^k approaches 0, as 2^k grows exponentially. Therefore, 3^{k/2^k} = e^{(k/2^k) ln 3} tends to e^0 =1. Therefore, lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}=1, so R=1/1=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. So, that&#x27;s the same answer as before.

Alternatively, if I use the root test on the series terms. For a general series sum a_k, the root test says that if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt;1, then converges absolutely; if &gt;1, diverges. Here, the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}, so each term a_k =3^k z^{2^k}. So, |a_k|^{1/k} = (3^k |z|^{2^k})^{1/k}=3 |z|^{2^k /k}. Now, as k approaches infinity, 2^k /k tends to infinity, so if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k} ≈(1 + (ln|z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈e^{(ln|z|)/k *2^k}=e^{(ln|z|) 2^k /k} which tends to infinity. Therefore, |a_k|^{1/k} tends to infinity. If |z| &lt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} tends to 0, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*0=0. If |z|=1, then |z|^{2^k /k}=1, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*1=3 &gt;1. Therefore, by the root test for series, the series converges absolutely when |z| &lt;1, diverges when |z| &gt;=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

So, both methods, the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem applied to the power series coefficients, and the root test applied to the series terms, give R=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

But let me just verify with a specific example. Take z=1/2. Then the series becomes sum 3^k (1/2)^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s compute the terms. For k=0: 1*(1/2)^1=1/2. k=1:3*(1/2)^2=3/4. k=2:9*(1/2)^4=9/16. k=3:27*(1/2)^8=27/256. k=4:81*(1/2)^16=81/65536. So, the terms are 1/2, 3/4, 9/16, 27/256, 81/65536,... Each term is (3/4)^k. Wait, but (3/4)^k? Wait, 3^k over 2^{2^k}. So, 3^k /4^{2^{k-1}}? Hmm, maybe not. Let&#x27;s see: for k=0: 3^0 /2^{2^0}=1/2. k=1:3/4. k=2:9/16. k=3:27/256. So, the denominators are 2, 4, 16, 256,... which is 2^{1}, 2^{2}, 2^{4}, 2^{8}, etc. So, denominator is 2^{2^k}. Therefore, each term is (3/4)^k * (1/2)^{2^k - 2^{k-1}}}? Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s overcomplicating.

But regardless, the terms are 3^k /2^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s check if that converges. Take the ratio of term k+1 over term k: (3^{k+1}/2^{2^{k+1}}}) / (3^k /2^{2^k}}) =3 /2^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 /2^{2^k(2 -1)}=3 /2^{2^k}. As k increases, the denominator is growing exponentially, so the ratio tends to zero. Therefore, by the ratio test, the series converges absolutely for z=1/2. Similarly, if we take |z|=r &lt;1, then |a_k|=3^k r^{2^k}, and the ratio |a_{k+1}| / |a_k| =3 r^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 r^{2^k}. Since r &lt;1, r^{2^k} tends to zero as k increases, so the ratio tends to zero, hence the series converges.

But if |z|=1, then |a_k|=3^k, which tends to infinity, so the series diverges. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k|=3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is even larger, so diverges. Therefore, all tests point to R=1.

Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

**Final Answer**
The radius of convergence is \boxed{1}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of convergence for the power series \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} \), we can use the root test and the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem.

1. **Root Test Approach**:
   - The series is given by \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Each term \( a_k = 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Applying the root test, we consider \( |a_k|^{1/k} = \left( 3^k |z|^{2^k} \right)^{1/k} = 3 |z|^{2^k / k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( 2^k / k \to \infty \). Therefore, if \( |z| &lt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to 0 \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to 0 \), which is less than 1, indicating convergence.
   - If \( |z| &gt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to \infty \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to \infty \), which is greater than 1, indicating divergence.
   - Thus, the series converges for \( |z| &lt; 1 \) and diverges for \( |z| &gt; 1 \).

2. **Cauchy-Hadamard Theorem**:
   - The theorem states \( R = 1 / \limsup_{n \to \infty} |c_n|^{1/n} \), where \( c_n \) are the coefficients of \( z^n \).
   - For our series, \( c_n = 3^k \) if \( n = 2^k \) and 0 otherwise.
   - We compute \( \limsup_{k \to \infty} |c_{2^k}|^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} (3^k)^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} 3^{k/2^k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( k/2^k \to 0 \), so \( 3^{k/2^k} \to 1 \). Hence, \( \limsup |c_n|^{1/n} = 1 \), giving \( R = 1 \).

Both methods confirm that the radius of convergence is \( \boxed{1} \).          </p>

Response: To find the radius of convergence, we first write our original series in its most standard form, then we identify its endpoints, and we compare them with our center.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of convergence for this power series: the sum from k=0 to infinity of 3^k times z raised to the 2^k power. Hmm, power series... radius of convergence... right. The radius of convergence is the value R such that the series converges if |z| &lt; R and diverges if |z| &gt; R. Got it.

But wait, this isn&#x27;t a standard power series where the exponents are just n or something. The exponents here are 2^k. So, the powers of z are increasing really quickly. Like, for k=0, it&#x27;s z^1, k=1 is z^2, k=2 is z^4, k=3 is z^8, and so on. So, the exponents are like 2^k instead of k. That&#x27;s different. So, maybe the standard root test or ratio test need some adjustments here?

Let me recall. For a standard power series sum a_n z^n, the radius of convergence R can be found using the root test: 1/R = lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}. But in this case, the exponents are not n, but 2^k. So, the coefficients are 3^k when the exponent is 2^k, and for other exponents, the coefficients are zero. So, the series is sparse, with lots of missing terms. So, maybe writing it in the standard form would involve a lot of zero coefficients. For example, between z^4 and z^8, there are z^5, z^6, z^7 terms missing, all with coefficient zero.

So, if I try to write this as sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n z^n, then c_n is 3^k if n = 2^k for some k, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the coefficients c_n are mostly zero except when n is a power of 2. Then, to compute the radius of convergence using the root test, which is lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So, since most c_n are zero, the lim sup would be the supremum of the limit points of |c_n|^{1/n}. But since the non-zero terms are at n=2^k, we can look at the limit as k approaches infinity of |c_{2^k}|^{1/(2^k)}. Because for n=2^k, c_n =3^k, so |c_n|^{1/n} = (3^k)^{1/(2^k)} = 3^{k / 2^k}. So, the lim sup would be the limit of 3^{k / 2^k} as k approaches infinity. Then, if that limit exists, that would be the value.

But first, let me compute k / 2^k as k approaches infinity. What&#x27;s the limit of k / 2^k? Hmm, as k grows, 2^k grows exponentially, while k grows linearly, so the limit should be zero. Therefore, 3^{k / 2^k} is 3^0 = 1. Therefore, the lim sup is 1, so 1/R =1, so R=1. Wait, so does that mean the radius of convergence is 1? But let me verify that again.

Wait, hold on. The root test for power series says that R = 1 / lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So here, the lim sup is 1, so R=1. But let me check with the ratio test as well, maybe. Although, ratio test is usually for when the terms are non-zero and you can take the ratio of consecutive terms. But here, the problem is that the terms are not consecutive. The exponents jump from 2^k to 2^{k+1}, which is doubling each time. So, between z^{2^k} and z^{2^{k+1}}, there are a lot of terms missing. So, maybe the ratio test isn&#x27;t directly applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the root test as applied to the series terms. The root test for the series convergence says that the series converges absolutely if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt; 1. Wait, but here the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}. So, each term is a_k = 3^k z^{2^k}. So, if I consider the lim sup of |a_k|^{1/k} = lim sup |3^k z^{2^k}|^{1/k} = lim sup (3 |z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = 3^{1/k} |z|^{2^k / k}.

So, as k approaches infinity, 3^{1/k} tends to 1, and |z|^{2^k / k}. Now, if |z| &lt; 1, then |z|^{2^k / k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k}. Since |z| &lt;1, |z|^{2^k} tends to zero as k approaches infinity. So, |z|^{2^k / k} = e^{(2^k / k) ln |z|}. Since ln |z| is negative, and 2^k / k tends to infinity, so this exponent tends to negative infinity, hence |z|^{2^k /k} tends to zero. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = 0 &lt;1, so the series converges absolutely.

If |z| =1, then |z|^{2^k / k} =1^{2^k /k}=1, so lim sup |a_k|^{1/k}=1. So, the root test is inconclusive here. Wait, but if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k}. Since |z| &gt;1, |z|^{1/k} = e^{(ln |z|)/k} ≈1 + (ln |z|)/k as k is large. Then, (1 + (ln |z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈ e^{(ln |z|)/k * 2^k} = e^{(ln |z|) 2^k /k}. Since 2^k /k tends to infinity, this exponent tends to infinity, so |z|^{2^k /k} tends to infinity. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = infinity, which is greater than 1, so the series diverges.

Wait, but hold on. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k| = 3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is 3^k times something growing exponentially (since |z|^{2^k} is like e^{2^k ln |z|}, which is exponential in 2^k). So, the terms themselves are going to infinity, so the series diverges. So, in this case, if |z| &gt;1, the terms don&#x27;t even approach zero, so the series diverges.

If |z| =1, then |a_k|=3^k *1^{2^k}=3^k, which tends to infinity, so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero, so the series diverges on |z|=1.

But wait, when |z| &lt;1, we saw that |a_k|^{1/k} tends to zero, so the root test tells us the series converges absolutely. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. But wait, but when I first considered the standard root test for power series (the lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}), I also got R=1. So, that seems consistent.

But let me check another approach. Since the exponents are 2^k, maybe substituting w = z^2 or something. Wait, but the exponents are 2^k, which is doubling each time. So, for k=0: 1, k=1:2, k=2:4, k=3:8, etc. So, the exponents are 2^k. So, the series can be written as sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}.

Alternatively, think of this as a lacunary series. I remember that lacunary series have gaps between exponents, and their convergence can be tricky. But maybe in this case, since the gaps are increasing exponentially, maybe the radius of convergence is still 1. But let me see.

Alternatively, suppose we use the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem. The theorem states that the radius of convergence R is given by 1 / lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}, where a_n is the coefficient of z^n. But in our case, as mentioned before, a_n is 3^k when n=2^k, otherwise 0. So, the lim sup is the supremum of all limit points of |a_n|^{1/n}. The non-zero terms are at n=2^k, so we need to compute lim sup_{n-&gt;infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} |3^k|^{1/2^k} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} 3^{k/2^k}.

As k approaches infinity, k/2^k approaches 0, as 2^k grows exponentially. Therefore, 3^{k/2^k} = e^{(k/2^k) ln 3} tends to e^0 =1. Therefore, lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}=1, so R=1/1=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. So, that&#x27;s the same answer as before.

Alternatively, if I use the root test on the series terms. For a general series sum a_k, the root test says that if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt;1, then converges absolutely; if &gt;1, diverges. Here, the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}, so each term a_k =3^k z^{2^k}. So, |a_k|^{1/k} = (3^k |z|^{2^k})^{1/k}=3 |z|^{2^k /k}. Now, as k approaches infinity, 2^k /k tends to infinity, so if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k} ≈(1 + (ln|z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈e^{(ln|z|)/k *2^k}=e^{(ln|z|) 2^k /k} which tends to infinity. Therefore, |a_k|^{1/k} tends to infinity. If |z| &lt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} tends to 0, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*0=0. If |z|=1, then |z|^{2^k /k}=1, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*1=3 &gt;1. Therefore, by the root test for series, the series converges absolutely when |z| &lt;1, diverges when |z| &gt;=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

So, both methods, the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem applied to the power series coefficients, and the root test applied to the series terms, give R=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

But let me just verify with a specific example. Take z=1/2. Then the series becomes sum 3^k (1/2)^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s compute the terms. For k=0: 1*(1/2)^1=1/2. k=1:3*(1/2)^2=3/4. k=2:9*(1/2)^4=9/16. k=3:27*(1/2)^8=27/256. k=4:81*(1/2)^16=81/65536. So, the terms are 1/2, 3/4, 9/16, 27/256, 81/65536,... Each term is (3/4)^k. Wait, but (3/4)^k? Wait, 3^k over 2^{2^k}. So, 3^k /4^{2^{k-1}}? Hmm, maybe not. Let&#x27;s see: for k=0: 3^0 /2^{2^0}=1/2. k=1:3/4. k=2:9/16. k=3:27/256. So, the denominators are 2, 4, 16, 256,... which is 2^{1}, 2^{2}, 2^{4}, 2^{8}, etc. So, denominator is 2^{2^k}. Therefore, each term is (3/4)^k * (1/2)^{2^k - 2^{k-1}}}? Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s overcomplicating.

But regardless, the terms are 3^k /2^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s check if that converges. Take the ratio of term k+1 over term k: (3^{k+1}/2^{2^{k+1}}}) / (3^k /2^{2^k}}) =3 /2^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 /2^{2^k(2 -1)}=3 /2^{2^k}. As k increases, the denominator is growing exponentially, so the ratio tends to zero. Therefore, by the ratio test, the series converges absolutely for z=1/2. Similarly, if we take |z|=r &lt;1, then |a_k|=3^k r^{2^k}, and the ratio |a_{k+1}| / |a_k| =3 r^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 r^{2^k}. Since r &lt;1, r^{2^k} tends to zero as k increases, so the ratio tends to zero, hence the series converges.

But if |z|=1, then |a_k|=3^k, which tends to infinity, so the series diverges. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k|=3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is even larger, so diverges. Therefore, all tests point to R=1.

Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

**Final Answer**
The radius of convergence is \boxed{1}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of convergence for the power series \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} \), we can use the root test and the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem.

1. **Root Test Approach**:
   - The series is given by \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Each term \( a_k = 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Applying the root test, we consider \( |a_k|^{1/k} = \left( 3^k |z|^{2^k} \right)^{1/k} = 3 |z|^{2^k / k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( 2^k / k \to \infty \). Therefore, if \( |z| &lt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to 0 \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to 0 \), which is less than 1, indicating convergence.
   - If \( |z| &gt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to \infty \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to \infty \), which is greater than 1, indicating divergence.
   - Thus, the series converges for \( |z| &lt; 1 \) and diverges for \( |z| &gt; 1 \).

2. **Cauchy-Hadamard Theorem**:
   - The theorem states \( R = 1 / \limsup_{n \to \infty} |c_n|^{1/n} \), where \( c_n \) are the coefficients of \( z^n \).
   - For our series, \( c_n = 3^k \) if \( n = 2^k \) and 0 otherwise.
   - We compute \( \limsup_{k \to \infty} |c_{2^k}|^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} (3^k)^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} 3^{k/2^k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( k/2^k \to 0 \), so \( 3^{k/2^k} \to 1 \). Hence, \( \limsup |c_n|^{1/n} = 1 \), giving \( R = 1 \).

Both methods confirm that the radius of convergence is \( \boxed{1} \).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of convergence for this power series: the sum from k=0 to infinity of 3^k times z raised to the 2^k power. Hmm, power series... radius of convergence... right. The radius of convergence is the value R such that the series converges if |z| &lt; R and diverges if |z| &gt; R. Got it.

But wait, this isn&#x27;t a standard power series where the exponents are just n or something. The exponents here are 2^k. So, the powers of z are increasing really quickly. Like, for k=0, it&#x27;s z^1, k=1 is z^2, k=2 is z^4, k=3 is z^8, and so on. So, the exponents are like 2^k instead of k. That&#x27;s different. So, maybe the standard root test or ratio test need some adjustments here?

Let me recall. For a standard power series sum a_n z^n, the radius of convergence R can be found using the root test: 1/R = lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}. But in this case, the exponents are not n, but 2^k. So, the coefficients are 3^k when the exponent is 2^k, and for other exponents, the coefficients are zero. So, the series is sparse, with lots of missing terms. So, maybe writing it in the standard form would involve a lot of zero coefficients. For example, between z^4 and z^8, there are z^5, z^6, z^7 terms missing, all with coefficient zero.

So, if I try to write this as sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n z^n, then c_n is 3^k if n = 2^k for some k, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the coefficients c_n are mostly zero except when n is a power of 2. Then, to compute the radius of convergence using the root test, which is lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So, since most c_n are zero, the lim sup would be the supremum of the limit points of |c_n|^{1/n}. But since the non-zero terms are at n=2^k, we can look at the limit as k approaches infinity of |c_{2^k}|^{1/(2^k)}. Because for n=2^k, c_n =3^k, so |c_n|^{1/n} = (3^k)^{1/(2^k)} = 3^{k / 2^k}. So, the lim sup would be the limit of 3^{k / 2^k} as k approaches infinity. Then, if that limit exists, that would be the value.

But first, let me compute k / 2^k as k approaches infinity. What&#x27;s the limit of k / 2^k? Hmm, as k grows, 2^k grows exponentially, while k grows linearly, so the limit should be zero. Therefore, 3^{k / 2^k} is 3^0 = 1. Therefore, the lim sup is 1, so 1/R =1, so R=1. Wait, so does that mean the radius of convergence is 1? But let me verify that again.

Wait, hold on. The root test for power series says that R = 1 / lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So here, the lim sup is 1, so R=1. But let me check with the ratio test as well, maybe. Although, ratio test is usually for when the terms are non-zero and you can take the ratio of consecutive terms. But here, the problem is that the terms are not consecutive. The exponents jump from 2^k to 2^{k+1}, which is doubling each time. So, between z^{2^k} and z^{2^{k+1}}, there are a lot of terms missing. So, maybe the ratio test isn&#x27;t directly applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the root test as applied to the series terms. The root test for the series convergence says that the series converges absolutely if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt; 1. Wait, but here the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}. So, each term is a_k = 3^k z^{2^k}. So, if I consider the lim sup of |a_k|^{1/k} = lim sup |3^k z^{2^k}|^{1/k} = lim sup (3 |z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = 3^{1/k} |z|^{2^k / k}.

So, as k approaches infinity, 3^{1/k} tends to 1, and |z|^{2^k / k}. Now, if |z| &lt; 1, then |z|^{2^k / k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k}. Since |z| &lt;1, |z|^{2^k} tends to zero as k approaches infinity. So, |z|^{2^k / k} = e^{(2^k / k) ln |z|}. Since ln |z| is negative, and 2^k / k tends to infinity, so this exponent tends to negative infinity, hence |z|^{2^k /k} tends to zero. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = 0 &lt;1, so the series converges absolutely.

If |z| =1, then |z|^{2^k / k} =1^{2^k /k}=1, so lim sup |a_k|^{1/k}=1. So, the root test is inconclusive here. Wait, but if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k}. Since |z| &gt;1, |z|^{1/k} = e^{(ln |z|)/k} ≈1 + (ln |z|)/k as k is large. Then, (1 + (ln |z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈ e^{(ln |z|)/k * 2^k} = e^{(ln |z|) 2^k /k}. Since 2^k /k tends to infinity, this exponent tends to infinity, so |z|^{2^k /k} tends to infinity. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = infinity, which is greater than 1, so the series diverges.

Wait, but hold on. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k| = 3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is 3^k times something growing exponentially (since |z|^{2^k} is like e^{2^k ln |z|}, which is exponential in 2^k). So, the terms themselves are going to infinity, so the series diverges. So, in this case, if |z| &gt;1, the terms don&#x27;t even approach zero, so the series diverges.

If |z| =1, then |a_k|=3^k *1^{2^k}=3^k, which tends to infinity, so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero, so the series diverges on |z|=1.

But wait, when |z| &lt;1, we saw that |a_k|^{1/k} tends to zero, so the root test tells us the series converges absolutely. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. But wait, but when I first considered the standard root test for power series (the lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}), I also got R=1. So, that seems consistent.

But let me check another approach. Since the exponents are 2^k, maybe substituting w = z^2 or something. Wait, but the exponents are 2^k, which is doubling each time. So, for k=0: 1, k=1:2, k=2:4, k=3:8, etc. So, the exponents are 2^k. So, the series can be written as sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}.

Alternatively, think of this as a lacunary series. I remember that lacunary series have gaps between exponents, and their convergence can be tricky. But maybe in this case, since the gaps are increasing exponentially, maybe the radius of convergence is still 1. But let me see.

Alternatively, suppose we use the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem. The theorem states that the radius of convergence R is given by 1 / lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}, where a_n is the coefficient of z^n. But in our case, as mentioned before, a_n is 3^k when n=2^k, otherwise 0. So, the lim sup is the supremum of all limit points of |a_n|^{1/n}. The non-zero terms are at n=2^k, so we need to compute lim sup_{n-&gt;infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} |3^k|^{1/2^k} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} 3^{k/2^k}.

As k approaches infinity, k/2^k approaches 0, as 2^k grows exponentially. Therefore, 3^{k/2^k} = e^{(k/2^k) ln 3} tends to e^0 =1. Therefore, lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}=1, so R=1/1=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. So, that&#x27;s the same answer as before.

Alternatively, if I use the root test on the series terms. For a general series sum a_k, the root test says that if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt;1, then converges absolutely; if &gt;1, diverges. Here, the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}, so each term a_k =3^k z^{2^k}. So, |a_k|^{1/k} = (3^k |z|^{2^k})^{1/k}=3 |z|^{2^k /k}. Now, as k approaches infinity, 2^k /k tends to infinity, so if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k} ≈(1 + (ln|z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈e^{(ln|z|)/k *2^k}=e^{(ln|z|) 2^k /k} which tends to infinity. Therefore, |a_k|^{1/k} tends to infinity. If |z| &lt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} tends to 0, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*0=0. If |z|=1, then |z|^{2^k /k}=1, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*1=3 &gt;1. Therefore, by the root test for series, the series converges absolutely when |z| &lt;1, diverges when |z| &gt;=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

So, both methods, the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem applied to the power series coefficients, and the root test applied to the series terms, give R=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

But let me just verify with a specific example. Take z=1/2. Then the series becomes sum 3^k (1/2)^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s compute the terms. For k=0: 1*(1/2)^1=1/2. k=1:3*(1/2)^2=3/4. k=2:9*(1/2)^4=9/16. k=3:27*(1/2)^8=27/256. k=4:81*(1/2)^16=81/65536. So, the terms are 1/2, 3/4, 9/16, 27/256, 81/65536,... Each term is (3/4)^k. Wait, but (3/4)^k? Wait, 3^k over 2^{2^k}. So, 3^k /4^{2^{k-1}}? Hmm, maybe not. Let&#x27;s see: for k=0: 3^0 /2^{2^0}=1/2. k=1:3/4. k=2:9/16. k=3:27/256. So, the denominators are 2, 4, 16, 256,... which is 2^{1}, 2^{2}, 2^{4}, 2^{8}, etc. So, denominator is 2^{2^k}. Therefore, each term is (3/4)^k * (1/2)^{2^k - 2^{k-1}}}? Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s overcomplicating.

But regardless, the terms are 3^k /2^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s check if that converges. Take the ratio of term k+1 over term k: (3^{k+1}/2^{2^{k+1}}}) / (3^k /2^{2^k}}) =3 /2^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 /2^{2^k(2 -1)}=3 /2^{2^k}. As k increases, the denominator is growing exponentially, so the ratio tends to zero. Therefore, by the ratio test, the series converges absolutely for z=1/2. Similarly, if we take |z|=r &lt;1, then |a_k|=3^k r^{2^k}, and the ratio |a_{k+1}| / |a_k| =3 r^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 r^{2^k}. Since r &lt;1, r^{2^k} tends to zero as k increases, so the ratio tends to zero, hence the series converges.

But if |z|=1, then |a_k|=3^k, which tends to infinity, so the series diverges. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k|=3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is even larger, so diverges. Therefore, all tests point to R=1.

Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( k/2^k \to 0 \), so \( 3^{k/2^k} \to 1 \). Hence, \( \limsup |c_n|^{1/n} = 1 \), giving \( R = 1 \).

So, if I try to write this as sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n z^n, then c_n is 3^k if n = 2^k for some k, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the coefficients c_n are mostly zero except when n is a power of 2. Then, to compute the radius of convergence using the root test, which is lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So, since most c_n are zero, the lim sup would be the supremum of the limit points of |c_n|^{1/n}. But since the non-zero terms are at n=2^k, we can look at the limit as k approaches infinity of |c_{2^k}|^{1/(2^k)}. Because for n=2^k, c_n =3^k, so |c_n|^{1/n} = (3^k)^{1/(2^k)} = 3^{k / 2^k}. So, the lim sup would be the limit of 3^{k / 2^k} as k approaches infinity. Then, if that limit exists, that would be the value.

But first, let me compute k / 2^k as k approaches infinity. What&#x27;s the limit of k / 2^k? Hmm, as k grows, 2^k grows exponentially, while k grows linearly, so the limit should be zero. Therefore, 3^{k / 2^k} is 3^0 = 1. Therefore, the lim sup is 1, so 1/R =1, so R=1. Wait, so does that mean the radius of convergence is 1? But let me verify that again.

Wait, hold on. The root test for power series says that R = 1 / lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}. So here, the lim sup is 1, so R=1. But let me check with the ratio test as well, maybe. Although, ratio test is usually for when the terms are non-zero and you can take the ratio of consecutive terms. But here, the problem is that the terms are not consecutive.

Wait, but here the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}. So, each term is a_k = 3^k z^{2^k}. So, if I consider the lim sup of |a_k|^{1/k} = lim sup |3^k z^{2^k}|^{1/k} = lim sup (3 |z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = 3^{1/k} |z|^{2^k / k}.

So, as k approaches infinity, 3^{1/k} tends to 1, and |z|^{2^k / k}. Now, if |z| &lt; 1, then |z|^{2^k / k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k} = (|z|^{2^k})^{1/k}. Since |z| &lt;1, |z|^{2^k} tends to zero as k approaches infinity. So, |z|^{2^k / k} = e^{(2^k / k) ln |z|}. Since ln |z| is negative, and 2^k / k tends to infinity, so this exponent tends to negative infinity, hence |z|^{2^k /k} tends to zero. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = 0 &lt;1, so the series converges absolutely.

If |z| =1, then |z|^{2^k / k} =1^{2^k /k}=1, so lim sup |a_k|^{1/k}=1. So, the root test is inconclusive here. Wait, but if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k}. Since |z| &gt;1, |z|^{1/k} = e^{(ln |z|)/k} ≈1 + (ln |z|)/k as k is large. Then, (1 + (ln |z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈ e^{(ln |z|)/k * 2^k} = e^{(ln |z|) 2^k /k}. Since 2^k /k tends to infinity, this exponent tends to infinity, so |z|^{2^k /k} tends to infinity. Therefore, lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} = infinity, which is greater than 1, so the series diverges.

Wait, but hold on. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k| = 3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is 3^k times something growing exponentially (since |z|^{2^k} is like e^{2^k ln |z|}, which is exponential in 2^k). So, the terms themselves are going to infinity, so the series diverges. So, in this case, if |z| &gt;1, the terms don&#x27;t even approach zero, so the series diverges.

If |z| =1, then |a_k|=3^k *1^{2^k}=3^k, which tends to infinity, so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero, so the series diverges on |z|=1.

But wait, when |z| &lt;1, we saw that |a_k|^{1/k} tends to zero, so the root test tells us the series converges absolutely. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. But wait, but when I first considered the standard root test for power series (the lim sup |c_n|^{1/n}), I also got R=1. So, that seems consistent.

But let me check another approach. Since the exponents are 2^k, maybe substituting w = z^2 or something. Wait, but the exponents are 2^k, which is doubling each time. So, for k=0: 1, k=1:2, k=2:4, k=3:8, etc. So, the exponents are 2^k. So, the series can be written as sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}.

Alternatively, think of this as a lacunary series. I remember that lacunary series have gaps between exponents, and their convergence can be tricky. But maybe in this case, since the gaps are increasing exponentially, maybe the radius of convergence is still 1. But let me see.

Alternatively, suppose we use the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem. The theorem states that the radius of convergence R is given by 1 / lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}, where a_n is the coefficient of z^n. But in our case, as mentioned before, a_n is 3^k when n=2^k, otherwise 0. So, the lim sup is the supremum of all limit points of |a_n|^{1/n}. The non-zero terms are at n=2^k, so we need to compute lim sup_{n-&gt;infty} |a_n|^{1/n} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} |3^k|^{1/2^k} = lim sup_{k-&gt;infty} 3^{k/2^k}.

As k approaches infinity, k/2^k approaches 0, as 2^k grows exponentially. Therefore, 3^{k/2^k} = e^{(k/2^k) ln 3} tends to e^0 =1. Therefore, lim sup |a_n|^{1/n}=1, so R=1/1=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1. So, that&#x27;s the same answer as before.

Alternatively, if I use the root test on the series terms. For a general series sum a_k, the root test says that if lim sup |a_k|^{1/k} &lt;1, then converges absolutely; if &gt;1, diverges. Here, the series is sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k}, so each term a_k =3^k z^{2^k}. So, |a_k|^{1/k} = (3^k |z|^{2^k})^{1/k}=3 |z|^{2^k /k}. Now, as k approaches infinity, 2^k /k tends to infinity, so if |z| &gt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} = (|z|^{1/k})^{2^k} ≈(1 + (ln|z|)/k)^{2^k} ≈e^{(ln|z|)/k *2^k}=e^{(ln|z|) 2^k /k} which tends to infinity. Therefore, |a_k|^{1/k} tends to infinity. If |z| &lt;1, then |z|^{2^k /k} tends to 0, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*0=0. If |z|=1, then |z|^{2^k /k}=1, so |a_k|^{1/k}=3*1=3 &gt;1. Therefore, by the root test for series, the series converges absolutely when |z| &lt;1, diverges when |z| &gt;=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

So, both methods, the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem applied to the power series coefficients, and the root test applied to the series terms, give R=1. Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

But let me just verify with a specific example. Take z=1/2. Then the series becomes sum 3^k (1/2)^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s compute the terms. For k=0: 1*(1/2)^1=1/2. k=1:3*(1/2)^2=3/4. k=2:9*(1/2)^4=9/16. k=3:27*(1/2)^8=27/256. k=4:81*(1/2)^16=81/65536. So, the terms are 1/2, 3/4, 9/16, 27/256, 81/65536,... Each term is (3/4)^k. Wait, but (3/4)^k? Wait, 3^k over 2^{2^k}. So, 3^k /4^{2^{k-1}}? Hmm, maybe not. Let&#x27;s see: for k=0: 3^0 /2^{2^0}=1/2. k=1:3/4. k=2:9/16. k=3:27/256. So, the denominators are 2, 4, 16, 256,... which is 2^{1}, 2^{2}, 2^{4}, 2^{8}, etc. So, denominator is 2^{2^k}. Therefore, each term is (3/4)^k * (1/2)^{2^k - 2^{k-1}}}? Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s overcomplicating.

But regardless, the terms are 3^k /2^{2^k}. Let&#x27;s check if that converges. Take the ratio of term k+1 over term k: (3^{k+1}/2^{2^{k+1}}}) / (3^k /2^{2^k}}) =3 /2^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 /2^{2^k(2 -1)}=3 /2^{2^k}. As k increases, the denominator is growing exponentially, so the ratio tends to zero. Therefore, by the ratio test, the series converges absolutely for z=1/2. Similarly, if we take |z|=r &lt;1, then |a_k|=3^k r^{2^k}, and the ratio |a_{k+1}| / |a_k| =3 r^{2^{k+1} -2^k}=3 r^{2^k}. Since r &lt;1, r^{2^k} tends to zero as k increases, so the ratio tends to zero, hence the series converges.

But if |z|=1, then |a_k|=3^k, which tends to infinity, so the series diverges. If |z| &gt;1, then |a_k|=3^k |z|^{2^k}, which is even larger, so diverges. Therefore, all tests point to R=1.

Therefore, the radius of convergence is 1.

**Final Answer**
The radius of convergence is \boxed{1}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of convergence for the power series \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k \cdot z^{2^k} \), we can use the root test and the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem.

1. **Root Test Approach**:
   - The series is given by \( \sum_{k=0}^\infty 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Each term \( a_k = 3^k z^{2^k} \).
   - Applying the root test, we consider \( |a_k|^{1/k} = \left( 3^k |z|^{2^k} \right)^{1/k} = 3 |z|^{2^k / k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( 2^k / k \to \infty \). Therefore, if \( |z| &lt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to 0 \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to 0 \), which is less than 1, indicating convergence.
   - If \( |z| &gt; 1 \), \( |z|^{2^k / k} \to \infty \), leading to \( |a_k|^{1/k} \to \infty \), which is greater than 1, indicating divergence.
   - Thus, the series converges for \( |z| &lt; 1 \) and diverges for \( |z| &gt; 1 \).

2. **Cauchy-Hadamard Theorem**:
   - The theorem states \( R = 1 / \limsup_{n \to \infty} |c_n|^{1/n} \), where \( c_n \) are the coefficients of \( z^n \).
   - For our series, \( c_n = 3^k \) if \( n = 2^k \) and 0 otherwise.
   - We compute \( \limsup_{k \to \infty} |c_{2^k}|^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} (3^k)^{1/2^k} = \limsup_{k \to \infty} 3^{k/2^k} \).
   - As \( k \to \infty \), \( k/2^k \to 0 \), so \( 3^{k/2^k} \to 1 \). Hence, \( \limsup |c_n|^{1/n} = 1 \), giving \( R = 1 \).

Both methods confirm that the radius of convergence is \( \boxed{1} \).          </p>

Response: This question uses the Cosine Law, which ties together the \sin ABC \sin ABC and \cos ABC \cos ABC to get the area. First, use the Cosine Law to get \boxed{42.}          </p>

Reference Answer: By the Law of Cosines,
\begin{align*}
b \cos C + c \cos B &amp;= b \cdot \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} + c \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac} \\

Response: We distribute the terms. $\frac{b^2}{2} (\sin C \cos C + \cos C \cos B + \sin C(1 - \cos B))$ $=\frac{b^2}{2} (0 + 2 \cos C \cos B + \sin C(1 - \cos B)) = \frac{b^2}{2} \cos C(1 + 2\cos B+ \sin C(1-\cos B)).$ We notice $\sin x = 1 - \cos^2x = 1 - \cos(2x).$ $=\frac{b^2}{2} \cos C \cos(2B + \sin C(1-\cos C)) = \frac{b^2}{2} \cos C \cos(2B) \cos(\sin C).$ We can rewrite $\cos \theta = \sin(\pi/2 - \theta).$ $= \frac{b^2}{2} (\cos C) \times (\cos C).$ $= \frac{b^2}{4} \cos^2 C.$ $= \frac{b^2}{4}.$ We find the area.

Response: We first multiply the Fractions: $b^2 \sin^2 C + b^2 \cos^2 C + b^2 c \sin C \cos C + c^2 b \sin B \cos B.$ There is a $+$ sign in the first two terms, and a $-$ sign between the next two. Then we subtract the second term from the first: $(b^2 - c^2) \sin^2 C + b^2 \cos^2 C - c^2 b \sin B \cos B$. Now we multiply the whole thing by half of the base of the triangle, $b.$ This gives $(\frac{1}{2} b^2 - \frac{1}{2} c^2) \sin^2 C + b c \cos B \sin C + (\frac{1}{2} b^2 - \frac{1}{2} c^2) \cos^2 C - \frac{1}{2} c^2 b \sin^2 B $. Adding a $-$ sign in front of $b^2 \cos^2 C$, multiplying by half of the base again, and rearranging gives $\frac{1}{2} b^2(\sin^2 C - \cos^2 C) + (\frac{1}{2} bc + \frac{1}{2} c^2 \cos B) \sin C + (\frac{1}{2} b^2 - \frac{1}{2} c^2) \cos^2 C - \frac{1}{2} c^2 b \sin^2 B $. Factor out another term, then multiply by $2$: $(bc + c^2) \sin C \cos C + (b^2 - c^2) \cos^2 C + (bc - c^2) \sin C \cos B - 2c^2 b \sin^2 B $. Now we subtract $bc \sin C \cos C$ from the first term and $\sin C \cos B$ from the second: $b^2 \cos^2 C + (b^2 - c^2) \cos^2 C - 2c^2 b \sin^2 B + (bc - c^2) \sin C \cos B$. Substitute $b^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - c^2$ for $b^2$, and replace the variable $b$ with one of the other two side lengths: $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - c^2 \cos B - 2c^2 b \sin^2 B + (bc - c^2)(b \cos C + c \cos B)$. Use the cosine-cosine identity $1=-\cos^2 C - \sin^2 C$ to simplify: \[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - c^2 \cos B + c^2 \sin^2 B + 2c^2 b \cos C - 2c^2 b \sin^2 B + 2(b \cos B)(b \cos C + c \cos B).\] Distribute the 2&#x27;s over the first three terms: $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - c^2 \cos B + 2(\cos B)(c^2 b \sin B) + 2(b \cos B)(b \cos C + c \cos B)$. Finally, multiply each of the two terms in parentheses by half the base of the triangle and put it into parentheses: \[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2c^2 b \cos B + 2b^2 \cos B \cos C + 2c^2 b \cos B \cos B\] \[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(\frac{1}{2} c^2 b \sin B)(2 \cos C) + 2b^2 \cos B \cos C + (2b^2 \cos B \cos C + 2c^2b \cos B)\] \[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2c^2 b \cos C \cos B + 2b^2 \cos B \cos C + 2c^2b \cos B\] \[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(c^2 b \sin C + b^2 \cos C) \cos B\] \[\boxed{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab+bc+ca) \cos B}.\] \boxed{ 42 }

Can you find the surface area of the box?

Should we draw a perspective projection or a parallel projection?

Parallel projection is much faster to calculate with a compass and straightedge -- we can just find intersection points.

Can you find the intersection points for the creases?

Writing to USERS: You have earned 7 points.

\boxed{cargoes}

Should we sketch the underlying surface?

Response: Combining the fractions into one algebraic fraction, we get \[(b \sin C)(b \cos C + c \cos B) = \frac{(b^2 \cos C) + (bc^2 \cos B)}{(b^2)} = \frac{bc^2 (\cos C + \cos B)}{b^2} = \frac{bc^2}{b^2} \cos \frac{C + B}{2} = \frac{c^2}{b} \cos \frac{C + B}{2}.\] From the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) theorem, we know that both triangles with angles $C$ and $C + B$ in the circumcircle have the length $bc$ as one side (the same angle-blocks). From this similarity they have an equal altitude of $c$ to $BC,$ which is equal to half the area of each triangle. The altitude to $BC$ of triangle $ABC$ is $cb,$ therefore the other angle-block has one leg of $b$ and hypotenuse of $cb.$ Hence the area of triangle $ABC$ is \boxed{bc^2 \frac{\sin \frac{C + B}{2}}{b} = \frac{bc^2}{b} \sin \frac{C + B}{2} = c^2 \sin \frac{C + B}{2}}.          </p>

Reference Answer: By the Law of Cosines,
\begin{align*}
b \cos C + c \cos B &amp;= b \cdot \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} + c \cdot \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac} \\
&amp;= \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2a} + \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2a} \\
&amp;= \frac{2a^2}{2a} = a,
\end{align*}so $ab \sin C = 42.$

Then the area of triangle $ABC$ is
\[\frac{1}{2} ab \sin C = \boxed{21}.\]          </p>

Response: [Determining the values of \textit{b} and \textit{c} from the data and then multiplying \textit{b} and \textit{c}]. Try to work this out on your own before looking at my answer.

Pretend that you needed 10 gallons of gasoline and it rains $5$ inches in one hour. You find that the gasoline is being pumped out of the tank at a rate of $p$s per minute, in gallons per minute, and the rain is falling in at a rate of $r$ inches per minute, in inches per minute.

The cost of the gas is $2$ dollars and the rain is free. However, your car needs an equal mix of gasoline and rain for safety reasons.

Your total bill would be $$2 +?$$

What does \boxed{\phantom {10}} equal?

Response: The above equation represents a Cos Rule law with triangle $ABC$. So we know that the area of $ABC$ can be computed using the Cos Rule as: 42 = $b^2 c \sin 2A$, and thus $b = \sqrt{\frac{42}{c \sin(2A)}}.$ \boxed{b}          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: If you want to find the area of $ABC,$ you need to distribute the $42$ to both sides of the equation.
We can factor out $(b)(c)$ because it is common to both sides of the equation. We then re-arrange.
(b/(sin C) + (c)/(cos C) = (42/(b)(c))
We know that the area of triangle $ABC$ represents the legs of the triangle. That is, $BC$ is the lessor leg and $CA$ is the greater leg. Using the length of leg $BC$ and $CA,$ we can we can now calculate the area of triangle $ABC.$          </p>

Response: Write the equation as $b^2 = (42sin(C))\cdot (42cos(C) + c cos(B)).$ Multiply 42cos(C) +c cos(B) by 42.

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limiting distribution of the scalar value \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity. The setup is that \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), and \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns each of unit norm. The scalar \( x \) is defined as the average of \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) over all columns \( m \) from 1 to \( M \).

First, let me parse the problem. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector, meaning each component is a complex normal random variable, independent, with zero mean and unit variance. The matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns with unit norm, so each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) satisfies \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_m = 1 \), and for \( m \neq n \), \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). However, since \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \), if \( M &gt; N \), the columns can&#x27;t all be orthogonal in \( \mathbb{C}^N \). Wait, but orthogonal columns in an \( N \times M \) matrix require that \( M \leq N \), right? Because in a space of dimension \( N \), you can have at most \( N \) orthogonal vectors. So maybe in this problem, \( M \) is approaching infinity, but \( N \) is also going to infinity? Wait, the problem states that \( M \) approaches infinity, but it doesn&#x27;t specify the behavior of \( N \). Hmm, this is a bit unclear. If \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, that would require \( M \leq N \), so if \( M \) is going to infinity, then \( N \) must also be going to infinity. So perhaps in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, but with some relation? Or maybe \( N \) is fixed, and the question is ill-posed? Wait, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed. But then, how can \( \mathbf{A} \) have \( M \) orthogonal columns if \( M &gt; N \)? That&#x27;s impossible. So perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is semi-unitary, meaning that when \( M \leq N \), the columns are orthonormal, but here since \( M \) is approaching infinity, maybe \( N \) is also approaching infinity with \( M \), such that \( M/N \) approaches some constant? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous here.

Wait, let me check again. The problem states that \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So each column has unit norm, and different columns are orthogonal. So if \( M \leq N \), such a matrix can exist, but if \( M &gt; N \), it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, if \( M \) approaches infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity to allow \( M \leq N \). So likely, in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with \( M \leq N \), but the problem states &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is some function of \( M \), perhaps \( N \geq M \). However, since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify the relation between \( N \) and \( M \), perhaps we need to assume that \( N \) is fixed and \( M \leq N \), but then taking \( M \) to infinity would require \( N \) to be infinite as well, which is not possible. This seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows \( \mathbf{A} \) to have approximately orthogonal columns when \( M \) is large, but that&#x27;s not stated. The problem says &quot;orthogonal columns of unit norm&quot;, so strictly, they have to be exactly orthogonal. Therefore, I must conclude that \( M \leq N \), and as \( M \) approaches infinity, \( N \) must also approach infinity. So, perhaps we have a scenario where both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some fixed ratio. However, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, not specifying \( N \), so maybe the answer will depend on the relation between \( M \) and \( N \). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are not exactly orthogonal but asymptotically orthogonal as \( M \) increases? But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so maybe the problem is in a regime where \( N \) is growing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), but then as \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as well. But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the key here is to compute the distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \), regardless of \( N \). But given that \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns of unit norm, if \( M \to \infty \), then \( N \) must also go to infinity. So perhaps they are taking the limit as both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some ratio. If the problem is from a wireless communications context, like a massive MIMO scenario, then maybe \( M \) and \( N \) are both large but with a fixed ratio, say \( M/N \) approaching a constant. But since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify, maybe we can proceed assuming that \( N \) is fixed, but then \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem as stated might have an issue. Alternatively, maybe the columns are not exactly orthogonal but the inner product between different columns is zero in expectation or something like that? But the problem states orthogonal columns, so that&#x27;s not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, like a Haar-distributed matrix. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns, then each \( \mathbf{a}_m \) is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere, and independent of each other. Wait, but if the columns are orthogonal, then they are not independent, since orthogonal vectors are dependent. So in that case, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, then the distribution is such that the columns form an orthonormal basis, but in that case, the distribution is the Haar measure on the Stiefel manifold.

But in the problem statement, \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So unless specified otherwise, perhaps we can assume that the columns are arbitrary but fixed, except for \( \mathbf{g} \) which is random. Wait, but the problem says &quot;determine the limiting distribution of \( x \)&quot;, so the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \), or also over \( \mathbf{A} \)? The problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. So then, the problem is: for a given deterministic matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, compute the distribution of \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) as \( M \to \infty \). However, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, then \( x \) is a linear combination of Gaussian variables, so it&#x27;s Gaussian itself. Then, the question is about the mean and variance of \( x \), and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens.

But wait, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic with orthogonal columns, then the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent? Let&#x27;s see. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), so \( \mathbf{g}^H \) is a row vector with complex Gaussian entries. Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, the projections onto different \( \mathbf{a}_m \)&#x27;s are uncorrelated. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian, they are independent.

Therefore, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian random variable. Let me check. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), the inner product \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian variable. The mean is zero, because \( \mathbf{g} \) has zero mean. The variance is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_m = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{I} \mathbf{a}_m = \|\mathbf{a}_m\|^2 = 1 \), since each column has unit norm. Therefore, each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is distributed as \( CN(0,1) \). Furthermore, since the columns \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, for \( m \neq n \), the covariance between \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) and \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_n \) is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_n = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). Therefore, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent and identically distributed as \( CN(0,1) \).

Therefore, \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. Since they are independent, the sum would be \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), the variance becomes \( \frac{1}{M^2} \times M = \frac{1}{M} \). Therefore, \( x \sim CN\left(0, \frac{1}{M}\right) \). As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) tends to zero, so the distribution of \( x \) converges in probability to zero. In other words, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function at zero. But the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, which usually refers to convergence in distribution. However, if the variance is going to zero and the mean is zero, then the limiting distribution is a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me confirm. Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), so the real and imaginary parts are each \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/2) \). So when you take the average of \( M \) such terms, the real part is \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/(2M)) \) and the imaginary part is the same. So as \( M \to \infty \), both the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution, hence the entire complex random variable converges to zero in distribution.

But perhaps the problem expects a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem? Wait, but we are averaging independent complex Gaussians, so the average is also a complex Gaussian with decreasing variance. However, if we consider the real or imaginary part, each is a real Gaussian with variance \( 1/(2M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, hence the distribution becomes a delta function. So there&#x27;s a contradiction here: if we take the average of Gaussians with variance \( 1/M \), then yes, it tends to zero. However, maybe if \( N \) is also changing with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that.

Wait, the problem says \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \). If \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) must have orthogonal columns, which is impossible for \( M &gt; N \). Therefore, the problem might be in a regime where \( N \) is also increasing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), so \( \mathbf{A} \) is a square unitary matrix when \( M = N \). If \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as \( M \). Then, in that case, the columns are orthonormal, and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens to the average \( x \).

But even if \( N = M \), then each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), independent, so the average is \( CN(0, 1/M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), variance tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), as long as \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, and \( M \to \infty \), then \( x \) converges to zero in distribution.

But wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me check again. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns, then the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are in \( \mathbb{C}^N \) and are orthogonal. Therefore, if \( M \leq N \), they form an orthonormal set. If \( M &gt; N \), such a matrix cannot exist. Therefore, if the problem states \( M \) approaching infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity with \( M \leq N \). However, without loss of generality, if \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, the problem is ill-posed because \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem must assume that both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, perhaps with \( M = N \), or \( M \) growing proportionally to \( N \).

But the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed, but that&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is allowed to have approximately orthogonal columns? For example, in large MIMO systems, random matrices with independent columns are approximately orthogonal when the dimensions are large. But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so strictly orthogonal. Therefore, perhaps in the problem, \( N \) is also going to infinity with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this. Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \leq N \), but \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is fixed. Then as \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is finite, the limit is not infinity. So this is also problematic.

This is confusing. Maybe the key here is to note that regardless of the relation between \( M \) and \( N \), as long as the columns are orthogonal, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is independent, and the average tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a delta function at zero.

But let&#x27;s check with an example. Suppose \( N = 1 \), then \( \mathbf{A} \) would be a \( 1 \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns. But in \( \mathbb{C}^1 \), the only way to have orthogonal columns is that all columns are zero except one, but each column must have unit norm. Therefore, if \( N = 1 \), \( \mathbf{A} \) can only have one non-zero column, which is 1. Therefore, \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed 1. So if \( N = 1 \), \( M = 1 \). Therefore, if \( N \) is fixed, \( M \) can&#x27;t go to infinity. Therefore, the problem must have \( N \) going to infinity as \( M \) does. So in the limit, as \( M \to \infty \), \( N \to \infty \) as well. Then, even though each term is \( CN(0,1) \), the average of \( M \) terms is \( CN(0, 1/M) \), which tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), the average tends to zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with my independence assumption. Let&#x27;s consider if the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are not random but fixed. Then, the projections \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent because \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian and the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal. Therefore, even if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, as long as its columns are orthogonal, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent. Therefore, their average is a sum of independent Gaussians, which is Gaussian with variance scaling as \( 1/M \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, so the distribution becomes degenerate at zero.

Therefore, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta at zero, meaning that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero. But in terms of distribution, we might say that it converges in law to a constant, which has zero variance. So the answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

But wait, the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, so perhaps we need to state it as a normal distribution with variance zero, which is the same as a constant. In real analysis, the limiting distribution would be a degenerate normal distribution with mean zero and variance zero. So in that case, the limiting distribution is \( \delta_0 \), but in the context of complex distributions, it&#x27;s a complex normal distribution with zero mean and zero covariance.

But maybe the problem expects a different answer. Let me think again. Suppose the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are random, for example, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns (Haar distributed). Then, even though the columns are orthogonal, the randomness of \( \mathbf{A} \) could affect the distribution. However, the problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. Therefore, the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \).

Therefore, \( x \) is a sum of independent complex Gaussians divided by \( M \), leading to a complex Gaussian with variance \( 1/M \). As \( M \to \infty \), this tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a constant zero. However, in probability theory, convergence to a constant implies convergence in distribution to that constant. So the answer should be that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem, but since we are averaging Gaussians, the result is still Gaussian with variance decreasing to zero. So in the limit, it&#x27;s a constant. Therefore, the limiting distribution is deterministic zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \). Hence, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me check once more. Let&#x27;s suppose \( N \) is growing with \( M \), say \( N = M \). Then, \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( M \times M \) unitary matrix. Then, \( \mathbf{g} \) is an \( M \times 1 \) vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \). Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{A} \) is a row vector where each entry is \( CN(0,1) \), and the entries are independent because the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are orthonormal. Therefore, the average of these entries is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \), which is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \), where \( z_m \sim CN(0,1) \) iid. The sum \( \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \) is \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), we get \( CN(0, 1/M) \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), this converges in distribution to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is indeed a point mass at zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \) is a degenerate distribution at zero, which can be written as \( \delta_0 \). However, in the context of complex normal distributions, we can say that \( x \) converges in distribution to \( 0 \), which is equivalent to \( CN(0,0) \).

Alternatively, if we consider real and imaginary parts, each has variance \( 1/(2M) \), so as \( M \to \infty \), both variances go to zero, so the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution. Therefore, the conclusion is the same.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero, so \( x \) converges in probability and in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \).

Given an \( N \)-by-\( 1 \) complex Gaussian random vector \( \mathbf{g} \) with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \) and an \( N \)-by-\( M \) complex matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, we need to determine the limiting distribution of the scalar \( x \) defined as:
\[ x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \]
as \( M \) approaches infinity.

1. **Orthogonal Columns and Gaussian Vector**: Each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) of \( \mathbf{A} \) is orthogonal to others and has unit norm. The vector \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with independent components.

2. **Projection Analysis**: Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, these projections are uncorrelated and hence independent complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance (i.e., \( CN(0,1) \)).

3. **Sum of Independent Gaussians**: The scalar \( x \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. The sum of \( M \) such variables is \( CN(0, M) \), and dividing by \( M \) results in \( x \sim CN(0, \frac{1}{M}) \).

4. **Limiting Behavior**: As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) of \( x \) tends to zero. This implies that \( x \) converges in distribution to a degenerate distribution at zero.

Thus, the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limiting distribution of the scalar value \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity. The setup is that \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), and \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns each of unit norm. The scalar \( x \) is defined as the average of \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) over all columns \( m \) from 1 to \( M \).

First, let me parse the problem. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector, meaning each component is a complex normal random variable, independent, with zero mean and unit variance. The matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns with unit norm, so each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) satisfies \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_m = 1 \), and for \( m \neq n \), \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). However, since \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \), if \( M &gt; N \), the columns can&#x27;t all be orthogonal in \( \mathbb{C}^N \). Wait, but orthogonal columns in an \( N \times M \) matrix require that \( M \leq N \), right? Because in a space of dimension \( N \), you can have at most \( N \) orthogonal vectors. So maybe in this problem, \( M \) is approaching infinity, but \( N \) is also going to infinity? Wait, the problem states that \( M \) approaches infinity, but it doesn&#x27;t specify the behavior of \( N \). Hmm, this is a bit unclear. If \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, that would require \( M \leq N \), so if \( M \) is going to infinity, then \( N \) must also be going to infinity. So perhaps in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, but with some relation? Or maybe \( N \) is fixed, and the question is ill-posed? Wait, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed. But then, how can \( \mathbf{A} \) have \( M \) orthogonal columns if \( M &gt; N \)? That&#x27;s impossible. So perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is semi-unitary, meaning that when \( M \leq N \), the columns are orthonormal, but here since \( M \) is approaching infinity, maybe \( N \) is also approaching infinity with \( M \), such that \( M/N \) approaches some constant? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous here.

Wait, let me check again. The problem states that \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So each column has unit norm, and different columns are orthogonal. So if \( M \leq N \), such a matrix can exist, but if \( M &gt; N \), it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, if \( M \) approaches infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity to allow \( M \leq N \). So likely, in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with \( M \leq N \), but the problem states &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is some function of \( M \), perhaps \( N \geq M \). However, since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify the relation between \( N \) and \( M \), perhaps we need to assume that \( N \) is fixed and \( M \leq N \), but then taking \( M \) to infinity would require \( N \) to be infinite as well, which is not possible. This seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows \( \mathbf{A} \) to have approximately orthogonal columns when \( M \) is large, but that&#x27;s not stated. The problem says &quot;orthogonal columns of unit norm&quot;, so strictly, they have to be exactly orthogonal. Therefore, I must conclude that \( M \leq N \), and as \( M \) approaches infinity, \( N \) must also approach infinity. So, perhaps we have a scenario where both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some fixed ratio. However, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, not specifying \( N \), so maybe the answer will depend on the relation between \( M \) and \( N \). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are not exactly orthogonal but asymptotically orthogonal as \( M \) increases? But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so maybe the problem is in a regime where \( N \) is growing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), but then as \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as well. But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the key here is to compute the distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \), regardless of \( N \). But given that \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns of unit norm, if \( M \to \infty \), then \( N \) must also go to infinity. So perhaps they are taking the limit as both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some ratio. If the problem is from a wireless communications context, like a massive MIMO scenario, then maybe \( M \) and \( N \) are both large but with a fixed ratio, say \( M/N \) approaching a constant. But since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify, maybe we can proceed assuming that \( N \) is fixed, but then \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem as stated might have an issue. Alternatively, maybe the columns are not exactly orthogonal but the inner product between different columns is zero in expectation or something like that? But the problem states orthogonal columns, so that&#x27;s not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, like a Haar-distributed matrix. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns, then each \( \mathbf{a}_m \) is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere, and independent of each other. Wait, but if the columns are orthogonal, then they are not independent, since orthogonal vectors are dependent. So in that case, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, then the distribution is such that the columns form an orthonormal basis, but in that case, the distribution is the Haar measure on the Stiefel manifold.

But in the problem statement, \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So unless specified otherwise, perhaps we can assume that the columns are arbitrary but fixed, except for \( \mathbf{g} \) which is random. Wait, but the problem says &quot;determine the limiting distribution of \( x \)&quot;, so the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \), or also over \( \mathbf{A} \)? The problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. So then, the problem is: for a given deterministic matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, compute the distribution of \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) as \( M \to \infty \). However, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, then \( x \) is a linear combination of Gaussian variables, so it&#x27;s Gaussian itself. Then, the question is about the mean and variance of \( x \), and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens.

But wait, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic with orthogonal columns, then the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent? Let&#x27;s see. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), so \( \mathbf{g}^H \) is a row vector with complex Gaussian entries. Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, the projections onto different \( \mathbf{a}_m \)&#x27;s are uncorrelated. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian, they are independent.

Therefore, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian random variable. Let me check. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), the inner product \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian variable. The mean is zero, because \( \mathbf{g} \) has zero mean. The variance is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_m = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{I} \mathbf{a}_m = \|\mathbf{a}_m\|^2 = 1 \), since each column has unit norm. Therefore, each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is distributed as \( CN(0,1) \). Furthermore, since the columns \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, for \( m \neq n \), the covariance between \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) and \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_n \) is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_n = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). Therefore, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent and identically distributed as \( CN(0,1) \).

Therefore, \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. Since they are independent, the sum would be \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), the variance becomes \( \frac{1}{M^2} \times M = \frac{1}{M} \). Therefore, \( x \sim CN\left(0, \frac{1}{M}\right) \). As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) tends to zero, so the distribution of \( x \) converges in probability to zero. In other words, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function at zero. But the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, which usually refers to convergence in distribution. However, if the variance is going to zero and the mean is zero, then the limiting distribution is a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me confirm. Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), so the real and imaginary parts are each \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/2) \). So when you take the average of \( M \) such terms, the real part is \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/(2M)) \) and the imaginary part is the same. So as \( M \to \infty \), both the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution, hence the entire complex random variable converges to zero in distribution.

But perhaps the problem expects a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem? Wait, but we are averaging independent complex Gaussians, so the average is also a complex Gaussian with decreasing variance. However, if we consider the real or imaginary part, each is a real Gaussian with variance \( 1/(2M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, hence the distribution becomes a delta function. So there&#x27;s a contradiction here: if we take the average of Gaussians with variance \( 1/M \), then yes, it tends to zero. However, maybe if \( N \) is also changing with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that.

Wait, the problem says \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \). If \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) must have orthogonal columns, which is impossible for \( M &gt; N \). Therefore, the problem might be in a regime where \( N \) is also increasing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), so \( \mathbf{A} \) is a square unitary matrix when \( M = N \). If \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as \( M \). Then, in that case, the columns are orthonormal, and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens to the average \( x \).

But even if \( N = M \), then each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), independent, so the average is \( CN(0, 1/M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), variance tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), as long as \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, and \( M \to \infty \), then \( x \) converges to zero in distribution.

But wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me check again. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns, then the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are in \( \mathbb{C}^N \) and are orthogonal. Therefore, if \( M \leq N \), they form an orthonormal set. If \( M &gt; N \), such a matrix cannot exist. Therefore, if the problem states \( M \) approaching infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity with \( M \leq N \). However, without loss of generality, if \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, the problem is ill-posed because \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem must assume that both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, perhaps with \( M = N \), or \( M \) growing proportionally to \( N \).

But the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed, but that&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is allowed to have approximately orthogonal columns? For example, in large MIMO systems, random matrices with independent columns are approximately orthogonal when the dimensions are large. But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so strictly orthogonal. Therefore, perhaps in the problem, \( N \) is also going to infinity with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this. Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \leq N \), but \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is fixed. Then as \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is finite, the limit is not infinity. So this is also problematic.

This is confusing. Maybe the key here is to note that regardless of the relation between \( M \) and \( N \), as long as the columns are orthogonal, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is independent, and the average tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a delta function at zero.

But let&#x27;s check with an example. Suppose \( N = 1 \), then \( \mathbf{A} \) would be a \( 1 \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns. But in \( \mathbb{C}^1 \), the only way to have orthogonal columns is that all columns are zero except one, but each column must have unit norm. Therefore, if \( N = 1 \), \( \mathbf{A} \) can only have one non-zero column, which is 1. Therefore, \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed 1. So if \( N = 1 \), \( M = 1 \). Therefore, if \( N \) is fixed, \( M \) can&#x27;t go to infinity. Therefore, the problem must have \( N \) going to infinity as \( M \) does. So in the limit, as \( M \to \infty \), \( N \to \infty \) as well. Then, even though each term is \( CN(0,1) \), the average of \( M \) terms is \( CN(0, 1/M) \), which tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), the average tends to zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with my independence assumption. Let&#x27;s consider if the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are not random but fixed. Then, the projections \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent because \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian and the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal. Therefore, even if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, as long as its columns are orthogonal, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent. Therefore, their average is a sum of independent Gaussians, which is Gaussian with variance scaling as \( 1/M \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, so the distribution becomes degenerate at zero.

Therefore, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta at zero, meaning that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero. But in terms of distribution, we might say that it converges in law to a constant, which has zero variance. So the answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

But wait, the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, so perhaps we need to state it as a normal distribution with variance zero, which is the same as a constant. In real analysis, the limiting distribution would be a degenerate normal distribution with mean zero and variance zero. So in that case, the limiting distribution is \( \delta_0 \), but in the context of complex distributions, it&#x27;s a complex normal distribution with zero mean and zero covariance.

But maybe the problem expects a different answer. Let me think again. Suppose the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are random, for example, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns (Haar distributed). Then, even though the columns are orthogonal, the randomness of \( \mathbf{A} \) could affect the distribution. However, the problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. Therefore, the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \).

Therefore, \( x \) is a sum of independent complex Gaussians divided by \( M \), leading to a complex Gaussian with variance \( 1/M \). As \( M \to \infty \), this tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a constant zero. However, in probability theory, convergence to a constant implies convergence in distribution to that constant. So the answer should be that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem, but since we are averaging Gaussians, the result is still Gaussian with variance decreasing to zero. So in the limit, it&#x27;s a constant. Therefore, the limiting distribution is deterministic zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \). Hence, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me check once more. Let&#x27;s suppose \( N \) is growing with \( M \), say \( N = M \). Then, \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( M \times M \) unitary matrix. Then, \( \mathbf{g} \) is an \( M \times 1 \) vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \). Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{A} \) is a row vector where each entry is \( CN(0,1) \), and the entries are independent because the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are orthonormal. Therefore, the average of these entries is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \), which is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \), where \( z_m \sim CN(0,1) \) iid. The sum \( \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \) is \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), we get \( CN(0, 1/M) \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), this converges in distribution to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is indeed a point mass at zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \) is a degenerate distribution at zero, which can be written as \( \delta_0 \). However, in the context of complex normal distributions, we can say that \( x \) converges in distribution to \( 0 \), which is equivalent to \( CN(0,0) \).

Alternatively, if we consider real and imaginary parts, each has variance \( 1/(2M) \), so as \( M \to \infty \), both variances go to zero, so the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution. Therefore, the conclusion is the same.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero, so \( x \) converges in probability and in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \).

Given an \( N \)-by-\( 1 \) complex Gaussian random vector \( \mathbf{g} \) with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \) and an \( N \)-by-\( M \) complex matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, we need to determine the limiting distribution of the scalar \( x \) defined as:
\[ x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \]
as \( M \) approaches infinity.

1. **Orthogonal Columns and Gaussian Vector**: Each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) of \( \mathbf{A} \) is orthogonal to others and has unit norm. The vector \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with independent components.

2. **Projection Analysis**: Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, these projections are uncorrelated and hence independent complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance (i.e., \( CN(0,1) \)).

3. **Sum of Independent Gaussians**: The scalar \( x \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. The sum of \( M \) such variables is \( CN(0, M) \), and dividing by \( M \) results in \( x \sim CN(0, \frac{1}{M}) \).

4. **Limiting Behavior**: As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) of \( x \) tends to zero. This implies that \( x \) converges in distribution to a degenerate distribution at zero.

Thus, the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limiting distribution of the scalar value \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity. The setup is that \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), and \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns each of unit norm. The scalar \( x \) is defined as the average of \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) over all columns \( m \) from 1 to \( M \).

First, let me parse the problem. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector, meaning each component is a complex normal random variable, independent, with zero mean and unit variance. The matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns with unit norm, so each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) satisfies \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_m = 1 \), and for \( m \neq n \), \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). However, since \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \), if \( M &gt; N \), the columns can&#x27;t all be orthogonal in \( \mathbb{C}^N \). Wait, but orthogonal columns in an \( N \times M \) matrix require that \( M \leq N \), right? Because in a space of dimension \( N \), you can have at most \( N \) orthogonal vectors. So maybe in this problem, \( M \) is approaching infinity, but \( N \) is also going to infinity? Wait, the problem states that \( M \) approaches infinity, but it doesn&#x27;t specify the behavior of \( N \). Hmm, this is a bit unclear. If \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, that would require \( M \leq N \), so if \( M \) is going to infinity, then \( N \) must also be going to infinity. So perhaps in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, but with some relation? Or maybe \( N \) is fixed, and the question is ill-posed? Wait, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed. But then, how can \( \mathbf{A} \) have \( M \) orthogonal columns if \( M &gt; N \)? That&#x27;s impossible. So perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is semi-unitary, meaning that when \( M \leq N \), the columns are orthonormal, but here since \( M \) is approaching infinity, maybe \( N \) is also approaching infinity with \( M \), such that \( M/N \) approaches some constant? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous here.

Wait, let me check again. The problem states that \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So each column has unit norm, and different columns are orthogonal. So if \( M \leq N \), such a matrix can exist, but if \( M &gt; N \), it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, if \( M \) approaches infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity to allow \( M \leq N \). So likely, in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with \( M \leq N \), but the problem states &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is some function of \( M \), perhaps \( N \geq M \). However, since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify the relation between \( N \) and \( M \), perhaps we need to assume that \( N \) is fixed and \( M \leq N \), but then taking \( M \) to infinity would require \( N \) to be infinite as well, which is not possible. This seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows \( \mathbf{A} \) to have approximately orthogonal columns when \( M \) is large, but that&#x27;s not stated. The problem says &quot;orthogonal columns of unit norm&quot;, so strictly, they have to be exactly orthogonal. Therefore, I must conclude that \( M \leq N \), and as \( M \) approaches infinity, \( N \) must also approach infinity. So, perhaps we have a scenario where both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some fixed ratio. However, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, not specifying \( N \), so maybe the answer will depend on the relation between \( M \) and \( N \). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are not exactly orthogonal but asymptotically orthogonal as \( M \) increases? But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so maybe the problem is in a regime where \( N \) is growing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), but then as \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as well. But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the key here is to compute the distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \), regardless of \( N \). But given that \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns of unit norm, if \( M \to \infty \), then \( N \) must also go to infinity. So perhaps they are taking the limit as both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some ratio. If the problem is from a wireless communications context, like a massive MIMO scenario, then maybe \( M \) and \( N \) are both large but with a fixed ratio, say \( M/N \) approaching a constant. But since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify, maybe we can proceed assuming that \( N \) is fixed, but then \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem as stated might have an issue. Alternatively, maybe the columns are not exactly orthogonal but the inner product between different columns is zero in expectation or something like that? But the problem states orthogonal columns, so that&#x27;s not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, like a Haar-distributed matrix. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns, then each \( \mathbf{a}_m \) is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere, and independent of each other. Wait, but if the columns are orthogonal, then they are not independent, since orthogonal vectors are dependent. So in that case, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, then the distribution is such that the columns form an orthonormal basis, but in that case, the distribution is the Haar measure on the Stiefel manifold.

But in the problem statement, \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So unless specified otherwise, perhaps we can assume that the columns are arbitrary but fixed, except for \( \mathbf{g} \) which is random. Wait, but the problem says &quot;determine the limiting distribution of \( x \)&quot;, so the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \), or also over \( \mathbf{A} \)? The problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. So then, the problem is: for a given deterministic matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, compute the distribution of \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) as \( M \to \infty \). However, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, then \( x \) is a linear combination of Gaussian variables, so it&#x27;s Gaussian itself. Then, the question is about the mean and variance of \( x \), and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens.

But wait, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic with orthogonal columns, then the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent? Let&#x27;s see. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), so \( \mathbf{g}^H \) is a row vector with complex Gaussian entries. Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, the projections onto different \( \mathbf{a}_m \)&#x27;s are uncorrelated. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian, they are independent.

Therefore, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian random variable. Let me check. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), the inner product \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian variable. The mean is zero, because \( \mathbf{g} \) has zero mean. The variance is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_m = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{I} \mathbf{a}_m = \|\mathbf{a}_m\|^2 = 1 \), since each column has unit norm. Therefore, each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is distributed as \( CN(0,1) \). Furthermore, since the columns \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, for \( m \neq n \), the covariance between \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) and \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_n \) is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_n = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). Therefore, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent and identically distributed as \( CN(0,1) \).

Therefore, \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. Since they are independent, the sum would be \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), the variance becomes \( \frac{1}{M^2} \times M = \frac{1}{M} \). Therefore, \( x \sim CN\left(0, \frac{1}{M}\right) \). As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) tends to zero, so the distribution of \( x \) converges in probability to zero. In other words, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function at zero. But the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, which usually refers to convergence in distribution. However, if the variance is going to zero and the mean is zero, then the limiting distribution is a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me confirm. Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), so the real and imaginary parts are each \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/2) \). So when you take the average of \( M \) such terms, the real part is \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/(2M)) \) and the imaginary part is the same. So as \( M \to \infty \), both the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution, hence the entire complex random variable converges to zero in distribution.

But perhaps the problem expects a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem? Wait, but we are averaging independent complex Gaussians, so the average is also a complex Gaussian with decreasing variance. However, if we consider the real or imaginary part, each is a real Gaussian with variance \( 1/(2M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, hence the distribution becomes a delta function. So there&#x27;s a contradiction here: if we take the average of Gaussians with variance \( 1/M \), then yes, it tends to zero. However, maybe if \( N \) is also changing with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that.

Wait, the problem says \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \). If \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) must have orthogonal columns, which is impossible for \( M &gt; N \). Therefore, the problem might be in a regime where \( N \) is also increasing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), so \( \mathbf{A} \) is a square unitary matrix when \( M = N \). If \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as \( M \). Then, in that case, the columns are orthonormal, and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens to the average \( x \).

But even if \( N = M \), then each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), independent, so the average is \( CN(0, 1/M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), variance tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), as long as \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, and \( M \to \infty \), then \( x \) converges to zero in distribution.

But wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me check again. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns, then the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are in \( \mathbb{C}^N \) and are orthogonal. Therefore, if \( M \leq N \), they form an orthonormal set. If \( M &gt; N \), such a matrix cannot exist. Therefore, if the problem states \( M \) approaching infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity with \( M \leq N \). However, without loss of generality, if \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, the problem is ill-posed because \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem must assume that both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, perhaps with \( M = N \), or \( M \) growing proportionally to \( N \).

But the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed, but that&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is allowed to have approximately orthogonal columns? For example, in large MIMO systems, random matrices with independent columns are approximately orthogonal when the dimensions are large. But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so strictly orthogonal. Therefore, perhaps in the problem, \( N \) is also going to infinity with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this. Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \leq N \), but \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is fixed. Then as \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is finite, the limit is not infinity. So this is also problematic.

This is confusing. Maybe the key here is to note that regardless of the relation between \( M \) and \( N \), as long as the columns are orthogonal, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is independent, and the average tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a delta function at zero.

But let&#x27;s check with an example. Suppose \( N = 1 \), then \( \mathbf{A} \) would be a \( 1 \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns. But in \( \mathbb{C}^1 \), the only way to have orthogonal columns is that all columns are zero except one, but each column must have unit norm. Therefore, if \( N = 1 \), \( \mathbf{A} \) can only have one non-zero column, which is 1. Therefore, \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed 1. So if \( N = 1 \), \( M = 1 \). Therefore, if \( N \) is fixed, \( M \) can&#x27;t go to infinity. Therefore, the problem must have \( N \) going to infinity as \( M \) does. So in the limit, as \( M \to \infty \), \( N \to \infty \) as well. Then, even though each term is \( CN(0,1) \), the average of \( M \) terms is \( CN(0, 1/M) \), which tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), the average tends to zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with my independence assumption. Let&#x27;s consider if the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are not random but fixed. Then, the projections \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent because \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian and the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal. Therefore, even if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, as long as its columns are orthogonal, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent. Therefore, their average is a sum of independent Gaussians, which is Gaussian with variance scaling as \( 1/M \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, so the distribution becomes degenerate at zero.

Therefore, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta at zero, meaning that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero. But in terms of distribution, we might say that it converges in law to a constant, which has zero variance. So the answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

But wait, the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, so perhaps we need to state it as a normal distribution with variance zero, which is the same as a constant. In real analysis, the limiting distribution would be a degenerate normal distribution with mean zero and variance zero. So in that case, the limiting distribution is \( \delta_0 \), but in the context of complex distributions, it&#x27;s a complex normal distribution with zero mean and zero covariance.

But maybe the problem expects a different answer. Let me think again. Suppose the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are random, for example, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns (Haar distributed). Then, even though the columns are orthogonal, the randomness of \( \mathbf{A} \) could affect the distribution. However, the problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. Therefore, the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \).

Therefore, \( x \) is a sum of independent complex Gaussians divided by \( M \), leading to a complex Gaussian with variance \( 1/M \). As \( M \to \infty \), this tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a constant zero. However, in probability theory, convergence to a constant implies convergence in distribution to that constant. So the answer should be that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem, but since we are averaging Gaussians, the result is still Gaussian with variance decreasing to zero. So in the limit, it&#x27;s a constant. Therefore, the limiting distribution is deterministic zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \). Hence, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me check once more. Let&#x27;s suppose \( N \) is growing with \( M \), say \( N = M \). Then, \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( M \times M \) unitary matrix. Then, \( \mathbf{g} \) is an \( M \times 1 \) vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \). Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{A} \) is a row vector where each entry is \( CN(0,1) \), and the entries are independent because the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are orthonormal. Therefore, the average of these entries is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \), which is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \), where \( z_m \sim CN(0,1) \) iid. The sum \( \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \) is \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), we get \( CN(0, 1/M) \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), this converges in distribution to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is indeed a point mass at zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \) is a degenerate distribution at zero, which can be written as \( \delta_0 \). However, in the context of complex normal distributions, we can say that \( x \) converges in distribution to \( 0 \), which is equivalent to \( CN(0,0) \).

Alternatively, if we consider real and imaginary parts, each has variance \( 1/(2M) \), so as \( M \to \infty \), both variances go to zero, so the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution. Therefore, the conclusion is the same.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero, so \( x \) converges in probability and in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given an \( N \)-by-\( 1 \) complex Gaussian random vector \( \mathbf{g} \) with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \) and an \( N \)-by-\( M \) complex matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, we need to determine the limiting distribution of the scalar \( x \) defined as:
\[ x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \]
as \( M \) approaches infinity.

1. **Orthogonal Columns and Gaussian Vector**: Each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) of \( \mathbf{A} \) is orthogonal to others and has unit norm. The vector \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with independent components.

2. **Projection Analysis**: Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, these projections are uncorrelated and hence independent complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance (i.e., \( CN(0,1) \)).

3. **Sum of Independent Gaussians**: The scalar \( x \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. The sum of \( M \) such variables is \( CN(0, M) \), and dividing by \( M \) results in \( x \sim CN(0, \frac{1}{M}) \).

4. **Limiting Behavior**: As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) of \( x \) tends to zero. This implies that \( x \) converges in distribution to a degenerate distribution at zero.

Thus, the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

Wait, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed. But then, how can \( \mathbf{A} \) have \( M \) orthogonal columns if \( M &gt; N \)? That&#x27;s impossible. So perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is semi-unitary, meaning that when \( M \leq N \), the columns are orthonormal, but here since \( M \) is approaching infinity, maybe \( N \) is also approaching infinity with \( M \), such that \( M/N \) approaches some constant? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous here.

Wait, let me check again. The problem states that \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So each column has unit norm, and different columns are orthogonal. So if \( M \leq N \), such a matrix can exist, but if \( M &gt; N \), it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, if \( M \) approaches infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity to allow \( M \leq N \). So likely, in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with \( M \leq N \), but the problem states &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is some function of \( M \), perhaps \( N \geq M \). However, since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify the relation between \( N \) and \( M \), perhaps we need to assume that \( N \) is fixed and \( M \leq N \), but then taking \( M \) to infinity would require \( N \) to be infinite as well, which is not possible. This seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows \( \mathbf{A} \) to have approximately orthogonal columns when \( M \) is large, but that&#x27;s not stated. The problem says &quot;orthogonal columns of unit norm&quot;, so strictly, they have to be exactly orthogonal. Therefore, I must conclude that \( M \leq N \), and as \( M \) approaches infinity, \( N \) must also approach infinity. So, perhaps we have a scenario where both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some fixed ratio. However, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, not specifying \( N \), so maybe the answer will depend on the relation between \( M \) and \( N \). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are not exactly orthogonal but asymptotically orthogonal as \( M \) increases? But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so maybe the problem is in a regime where \( N \) is growing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), but then as \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as well. But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the key here is to compute the distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \), regardless of \( N \). But given that \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns of unit norm, if \( M \to \infty \), then \( N \) must also go to infinity. So perhaps they are taking the limit as both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some ratio. If the problem is from a wireless communications context, like a massive MIMO scenario, then maybe \( M \) and \( N \) are both large but with a fixed ratio, say \( M/N \) approaching a constant. But since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify, maybe we can proceed assuming that \( N \) is fixed, but then \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem as stated might have an issue. Alternatively, maybe the columns are not exactly orthogonal but the inner product between different columns is zero in expectation or something like that? But the problem states orthogonal columns, so that&#x27;s not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, like a Haar-distributed matrix. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns, then each \( \mathbf{a}_m \) is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere, and independent of each other. Wait, but if the columns are orthogonal, then they are not independent, since orthogonal vectors are dependent. So in that case, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, then the distribution is such that the columns form an orthonormal basis, but in that case, the distribution is the Haar measure on the Stiefel manifold.

But in the problem statement, \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So unless specified otherwise, perhaps we can assume that the columns are arbitrary but fixed, except for \( \mathbf{g} \) which is random. Wait, but the problem says &quot;determine the limiting distribution of \( x \)&quot;, so the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \), or also over \( \mathbf{A} \)? The problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. So then, the problem is: for a given deterministic matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, compute the distribution of \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) as \( M \to \infty \). However, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, then \( x \) is a linear combination of Gaussian variables, so it&#x27;s Gaussian itself. Then, the question is about the mean and variance of \( x \), and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens.

But wait, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic with orthogonal columns, then the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent? Let&#x27;s see. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), so \( \mathbf{g}^H \) is a row vector with complex Gaussian entries. Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, the projections onto different \( \mathbf{a}_m \)&#x27;s are uncorrelated. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian, they are independent.

Therefore, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian random variable. Let me check. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), the inner product \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian variable. The mean is zero, because \( \mathbf{g} \) has zero mean. The variance is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_m = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{I} \mathbf{a}_m = \|\mathbf{a}_m\|^2 = 1 \), since each column has unit norm. Therefore, each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is distributed as \( CN(0,1) \). Furthermore, since the columns \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, for \( m \neq n \), the covariance between \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) and \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_n \) is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_n = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). Therefore, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent and identically distributed as \( CN(0,1) \).

Therefore, \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. Since they are independent, the sum would be \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), the variance becomes \( \frac{1}{M^2} \times M = \frac{1}{M} \). Therefore, \( x \sim CN\left(0, \frac{1}{M}\right) \). As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) tends to zero, so the distribution of \( x \) converges in probability to zero. In other words, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function at zero. But the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, which usually refers to convergence in distribution. However, if the variance is going to zero and the mean is zero, then the limiting distribution is a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me confirm. Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), so the real and imaginary parts are each \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/2) \). So when you take the average of \( M \) such terms, the real part is \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/(2M)) \) and the imaginary part is the same. So as \( M \to \infty \), both the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution, hence the entire complex random variable converges to zero in distribution.

But perhaps the problem expects a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem? Wait, but we are averaging independent complex Gaussians, so the average is also a complex Gaussian with decreasing variance. However, if we consider the real or imaginary part, each is a real Gaussian with variance \( 1/(2M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, hence the distribution becomes a delta function. So there&#x27;s a contradiction here: if we take the average of Gaussians with variance \( 1/M \), then yes, it tends to zero. However, maybe if \( N \) is also changing with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that.

Wait, the problem says \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \). If \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) must have orthogonal columns, which is impossible for \( M &gt; N \). Therefore, the problem might be in a regime where \( N \) is also increasing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), so \( \mathbf{A} \) is a square unitary matrix when \( M = N \). If \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as \( M \). Then, in that case, the columns are orthonormal, and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens to the average \( x \).

But even if \( N = M \), then each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), independent, so the average is \( CN(0, 1/M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), variance tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), as long as \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, and \( M \to \infty \), then \( x \) converges to zero in distribution.

But wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me check again. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns, then the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are in \( \mathbb{C}^N \) and are orthogonal. Therefore, if \( M \leq N \), they form an orthonormal set. If \( M &gt; N \), such a matrix cannot exist. Therefore, if the problem states \( M \) approaching infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity with \( M \leq N \). However, without loss of generality, if \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, the problem is ill-posed because \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem must assume that both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, perhaps with \( M = N \), or \( M \) growing proportionally to \( N \).

But the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed, but that&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is allowed to have approximately orthogonal columns? For example, in large MIMO systems, random matrices with independent columns are approximately orthogonal when the dimensions are large. But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so strictly orthogonal. Therefore, perhaps in the problem, \( N \) is also going to infinity with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this. Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \leq N \), but \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is fixed. Then as \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is finite, the limit is not infinity. So this is also problematic.

This is confusing. Maybe the key here is to note that regardless of the relation between \( M \) and \( N \), as long as the columns are orthogonal, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is independent, and the average tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a delta function at zero.

But let&#x27;s check with an example. Suppose \( N = 1 \), then \( \mathbf{A} \) would be a \( 1 \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns. But in \( \mathbb{C}^1 \), the only way to have orthogonal columns is that all columns are zero except one, but each column must have unit norm. Therefore, if \( N = 1 \), \( \mathbf{A} \) can only have one non-zero column, which is 1. Therefore, \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed 1. So if \( N = 1 \), \( M = 1 \). Therefore, if \( N \) is fixed, \( M \) can&#x27;t go to infinity. Therefore, the problem must have \( N \) going to infinity as \( M \) does. So in the limit, as \( M \to \infty \), \( N \to \infty \) as well. Then, even though each term is \( CN(0,1) \), the average of \( M \) terms is \( CN(0, 1/M) \), which tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), the average tends to zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with my independence assumption. Let&#x27;s consider if the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are not random but fixed. Then, the projections \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent because \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian and the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal. Therefore, even if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, as long as its columns are orthogonal, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent. Therefore, their average is a sum of independent Gaussians, which is Gaussian with variance scaling as \( 1/M \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, so the distribution becomes degenerate at zero.

Therefore, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta at zero, meaning that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero. But in terms of distribution, we might say that it converges in law to a constant, which has zero variance. So the answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

But wait, the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, so perhaps we need to state it as a normal distribution with variance zero, which is the same as a constant. In real analysis, the limiting distribution would be a degenerate normal distribution with mean zero and variance zero. So in that case, the limiting distribution is \( \delta_0 \), but in the context of complex distributions, it&#x27;s a complex normal distribution with zero mean and zero covariance.

But maybe the problem expects a different answer. Let me think again. Suppose the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are random, for example, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns (Haar distributed). Then, even though the columns are orthogonal, the randomness of \( \mathbf{A} \) could affect the distribution. However, the problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. Therefore, the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \).

Therefore, \( x \) is a sum of independent complex Gaussians divided by \( M \), leading to a complex Gaussian with variance \( 1/M \). As \( M \to \infty \), this tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a constant zero. However, in probability theory, convergence to a constant implies convergence in distribution to that constant. So the answer should be that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem, but since we are averaging Gaussians, the result is still Gaussian with variance decreasing to zero. So in the limit, it&#x27;s a constant. Therefore, the limiting distribution is deterministic zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \). Hence, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me check once more. Let&#x27;s suppose \( N \) is growing with \( M \), say \( N = M \). Then, \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( M \times M \) unitary matrix. Then, \( \mathbf{g} \) is an \( M \times 1 \) vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \). Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{A} \) is a row vector where each entry is \( CN(0,1) \), and the entries are independent because the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are orthonormal. Therefore, the average of these entries is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \), which is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \), where \( z_m \sim CN(0,1) \) iid. The sum \( \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \) is \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), we get \( CN(0, 1/M) \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), this converges in distribution to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is indeed a point mass at zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \) is a degenerate distribution at zero, which can be written as \( \delta_0 \). However, in the context of complex normal distributions, we can say that \( x \) converges in distribution to \( 0 \), which is equivalent to \( CN(0,0) \).

Alternatively, if we consider real and imaginary parts, each has variance \( 1/(2M) \), so as \( M \to \infty \), both variances go to zero, so the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution. Therefore, the conclusion is the same.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero, so \( x \) converges in probability and in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given an \( N \)-by-\( 1 \) complex Gaussian random vector \( \mathbf{g} \) with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \) and an \( N \)-by-\( M \) complex matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, we need to determine the limiting distribution of the scalar \( x \) defined as:
\[ x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \]
as \( M \) approaches infinity.

1. **Orthogonal Columns and Gaussian Vector**: Each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) of \( \mathbf{A} \) is orthogonal to others and has unit norm. The vector \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with independent components.

2. **Projection Analysis**: Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, these projections are uncorrelated and hence independent complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance (i.e., \( CN(0,1) \)).

3. **Sum of Independent Gaussians**: The scalar \( x \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. The sum of \( M \) such variables is \( CN(0, M) \), and dividing by \( M \) results in \( x \sim CN(0, \frac{1}{M}) \).

4. **Limiting Behavior**: As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) of \( x \) tends to zero. This implies that \( x \) converges in distribution to a degenerate distribution at zero.

Thus, the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limiting distribution of the scalar value \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity. The setup is that \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), and \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns each of unit norm. The scalar \( x \) is defined as the average of \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) over all columns \( m \) from 1 to \( M \).

First, let me parse the problem. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector, meaning each component is a complex normal random variable, independent, with zero mean and unit variance. The matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns with unit norm, so each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) satisfies \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_m = 1 \), and for \( m \neq n \), \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). However, since \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \), if \( M &gt; N \), the columns can&#x27;t all be orthogonal in \( \mathbb{C}^N \). Wait, but orthogonal columns in an \( N \times M \) matrix require that \( M \leq N \), right? Because in a space of dimension \( N \), you can have at most \( N \) orthogonal vectors. So maybe in this problem, \( M \) is approaching infinity, but \( N \) is also going to infinity? Wait, the problem states that \( M \) approaches infinity, but it doesn&#x27;t specify the behavior of \( N \). Hmm, this is a bit unclear. If \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, that would require \( M \leq N \), so if \( M \) is going to infinity, then \( N \) must also be going to infinity. So perhaps in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, but with some relation? Or maybe \( N \) is fixed, and the question is ill-posed? Wait, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed. But then, how can \( \mathbf{A} \) have \( M \) orthogonal columns if \( M &gt; N \)? That&#x27;s impossible. So perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is semi-unitary, meaning that when \( M \leq N \), the columns are orthonormal, but here since \( M \) is approaching infinity, maybe \( N \) is also approaching infinity with \( M \), such that \( M/N \) approaches some constant? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous here.

Wait, let me check again. The problem states that \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So each column has unit norm, and different columns are orthogonal. So if \( M \leq N \), such a matrix can exist, but if \( M &gt; N \), it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, if \( M \) approaches infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity to allow \( M \leq N \). So likely, in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with \( M \leq N \), but the problem states &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is some function of \( M \), perhaps \( N \geq M \). However, since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify the relation between \( N \) and \( M \), perhaps we need to assume that \( N \) is fixed and \( M \leq N \), but then taking \( M \) to infinity would require \( N \) to be infinite as well, which is not possible. This seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows \( \mathbf{A} \) to have approximately orthogonal columns when \( M \) is large, but that&#x27;s not stated. The problem says &quot;orthogonal columns of unit norm&quot;, so strictly, they have to be exactly orthogonal. Therefore, I must conclude that \( M \leq N \), and as \( M \) approaches infinity, \( N \) must also approach infinity. So, perhaps we have a scenario where both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some fixed ratio. However, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, not specifying \( N \), so maybe the answer will depend on the relation between \( M \) and \( N \). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are not exactly orthogonal but asymptotically orthogonal as \( M \) increases? But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so maybe the problem is in a regime where \( N \) is growing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), but then as \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as well. But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the key here is to compute the distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \), regardless of \( N \). But given that \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns of unit norm, if \( M \to \infty \), then \( N \) must also go to infinity. So perhaps they are taking the limit as both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some ratio. If the problem is from a wireless communications context, like a massive MIMO scenario, then maybe \( M \) and \( N \) are both large but with a fixed ratio, say \( M/N \) approaching a constant. But since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify, maybe we can proceed assuming that \( N \) is fixed, but then \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem as stated might have an issue. Alternatively, maybe the columns are not exactly orthogonal but the inner product between different columns is zero in expectation or something like that? But the problem states orthogonal columns, so that&#x27;s not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, like a Haar-distributed matrix. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns, then each \( \mathbf{a}_m \) is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere, and independent of each other. Wait, but if the columns are orthogonal, then they are not independent, since orthogonal vectors are dependent. So in that case, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, then the distribution is such that the columns form an orthonormal basis, but in that case, the distribution is the Haar measure on the Stiefel manifold.

But in the problem statement, \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So unless specified otherwise, perhaps we can assume that the columns are arbitrary but fixed, except for \( \mathbf{g} \) which is random. Wait, but the problem says &quot;determine the limiting distribution of \( x \)&quot;, so the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \), or also over \( \mathbf{A} \)? The problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. So then, the problem is: for a given deterministic matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, compute the distribution of \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) as \( M \to \infty \). However, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, then \( x \) is a linear combination of Gaussian variables, so it&#x27;s Gaussian itself. Then, the question is about the mean and variance of \( x \), and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens.

But wait, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic with orthogonal columns, then the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent? Let&#x27;s see. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), so \( \mathbf{g}^H \) is a row vector with complex Gaussian entries. Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, the projections onto different \( \mathbf{a}_m \)&#x27;s are uncorrelated. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian, they are independent.

Therefore, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian random variable. Let me check. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), the inner product \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian variable. The mean is zero, because \( \mathbf{g} \) has zero mean. The variance is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_m = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{I} \mathbf{a}_m = \|\mathbf{a}_m\|^2 = 1 \), since each column has unit norm. Therefore, each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is distributed as \( CN(0,1) \). Furthermore, since the columns \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, for \( m \neq n \), the covariance between \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) and \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_n \) is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_n = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). Therefore, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent and identically distributed as \( CN(0,1) \).

Therefore, \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. Since they are independent, the sum would be \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), the variance becomes \( \frac{1}{M^2} \times M = \frac{1}{M} \). Therefore, \( x \sim CN\left(0, \frac{1}{M}\right) \). As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) tends to zero, so the distribution of \( x \) converges in probability to zero. In other words, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function at zero. But the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, which usually refers to convergence in distribution. However, if the variance is going to zero and the mean is zero, then the limiting distribution is a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me confirm. Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), so the real and imaginary parts are each \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/2) \). So when you take the average of \( M \) such terms, the real part is \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/(2M)) \) and the imaginary part is the same. So as \( M \to \infty \), both the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution, hence the entire complex random variable converges to zero in distribution.

But perhaps the problem expects a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem? Wait, but we are averaging independent complex Gaussians, so the average is also a complex Gaussian with decreasing variance. However, if we consider the real or imaginary part, each is a real Gaussian with variance \( 1/(2M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, hence the distribution becomes a delta function. So there&#x27;s a contradiction here: if we take the average of Gaussians with variance \( 1/M \), then yes, it tends to zero. However, maybe if \( N \) is also changing with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that.

Wait, the problem says \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \). If \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) must have orthogonal columns, which is impossible for \( M &gt; N \). Therefore, the problem might be in a regime where \( N \) is also increasing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), so \( \mathbf{A} \) is a square unitary matrix when \( M = N \). If \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as \( M \). Then, in that case, the columns are orthonormal, and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens to the average \( x \).

But even if \( N = M \), then each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), independent, so the average is \( CN(0, 1/M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), variance tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), as long as \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, and \( M \to \infty \), then \( x \) converges to zero in distribution.

But wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me check again. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns, then the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are in \( \mathbb{C}^N \) and are orthogonal. Therefore, if \( M \leq N \), they form an orthonormal set. If \( M &gt; N \), such a matrix cannot exist. Therefore, if the problem states \( M \) approaching infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity with \( M \leq N \). However, without loss of generality, if \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, the problem is ill-posed because \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem must assume that both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, perhaps with \( M = N \), or \( M \) growing proportionally to \( N \).

But the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed, but that&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is allowed to have approximately orthogonal columns? For example, in large MIMO systems, random matrices with independent columns are approximately orthogonal when the dimensions are large. But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so strictly orthogonal. Therefore, perhaps in the problem, \( N \) is also going to infinity with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this. Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \leq N \), but \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is fixed. Then as \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is finite, the limit is not infinity. So this is also problematic.

This is confusing. Maybe the key here is to note that regardless of the relation between \( M \) and \( N \), as long as the columns are orthogonal, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is independent, and the average tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a delta function at zero.

But let&#x27;s check with an example. Suppose \( N = 1 \), then \( \mathbf{A} \) would be a \( 1 \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns. But in \( \mathbb{C}^1 \), the only way to have orthogonal columns is that all columns are zero except one, but each column must have unit norm. Therefore, if \( N = 1 \), \( \mathbf{A} \) can only have one non-zero column, which is 1. Therefore, \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed 1. So if \( N = 1 \), \( M = 1 \). Therefore, if \( N \) is fixed, \( M \) can&#x27;t go to infinity. Therefore, the problem must have \( N \) going to infinity as \( M \) does. So in the limit, as \( M \to \infty \), \( N \to \infty \) as well. Then, even though each term is \( CN(0,1) \), the average of \( M \) terms is \( CN(0, 1/M) \), which tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), the average tends to zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with my independence assumption. Let&#x27;s consider if the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are not random but fixed. Then, the projections \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent because \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian and the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal. Therefore, even if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, as long as its columns are orthogonal, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent. Therefore, their average is a sum of independent Gaussians, which is Gaussian with variance scaling as \( 1/M \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, so the distribution becomes degenerate at zero.

Therefore, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta at zero, meaning that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero. But in terms of distribution, we might say that it converges in law to a constant, which has zero variance. So the answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

But wait, the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, so perhaps we need to state it as a normal distribution with variance zero, which is the same as a constant. In real analysis, the limiting distribution would be a degenerate normal distribution with mean zero and variance zero. So in that case, the limiting distribution is \( \delta_0 \), but in the context of complex distributions, it&#x27;s a complex normal distribution with zero mean and zero covariance.

But maybe the problem expects a different answer. Let me think again. Suppose the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are random, for example, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns (Haar distributed). Then, even though the columns are orthogonal, the randomness of \( \mathbf{A} \) could affect the distribution. However, the problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. Therefore, the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \).

Therefore, \( x \) is a sum of independent complex Gaussians divided by \( M \), leading to a complex Gaussian with variance \( 1/M \). As \( M \to \infty \), this tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a constant zero. However, in probability theory, convergence to a constant implies convergence in distribution to that constant. So the answer should be that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem, but since we are averaging Gaussians, the result is still Gaussian with variance decreasing to zero. So in the limit, it&#x27;s a constant. Therefore, the limiting distribution is deterministic zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \). Hence, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me check once more. Let&#x27;s suppose \( N \) is growing with \( M \), say \( N = M \). Then, \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( M \times M \) unitary matrix. Then, \( \mathbf{g} \) is an \( M \times 1 \) vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \). Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{A} \) is a row vector where each entry is \( CN(0,1) \), and the entries are independent because the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are orthonormal. Therefore, the average of these entries is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \), which is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \), where \( z_m \sim CN(0,1) \) iid. The sum \( \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \) is \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), we get \( CN(0, 1/M) \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), this converges in distribution to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is indeed a point mass at zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \) is a degenerate distribution at zero, which can be written as \( \delta_0 \). However, in the context of complex normal distributions, we can say that \( x \) converges in distribution to \( 0 \), which is equivalent to \( CN(0,0) \).

Alternatively, if we consider real and imaginary parts, each has variance \( 1/(2M) \), so as \( M \to \infty \), both variances go to zero, so the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution. Therefore, the conclusion is the same.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero, so \( x \) converges in probability and in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given an \( N \)-by-\( 1 \) complex Gaussian random vector \( \mathbf{g} \) with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \) and an \( N \)-by-\( M \) complex matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, we need to determine the limiting distribution of the scalar \( x \) defined as:
\[ x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \]
as \( M \) approaches infinity.

1. **Orthogonal Columns and Gaussian Vector**: Each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) of \( \mathbf{A} \) is orthogonal to others and has unit norm. The vector \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with independent components.

2. **Projection Analysis**: Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, these projections are uncorrelated and hence independent complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance (i.e., \( CN(0,1) \)).

3. **Sum of Independent Gaussians**: The scalar \( x \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. The sum of \( M \) such variables is \( CN(0, M) \), and dividing by \( M \) results in \( x \sim CN(0, \frac{1}{M}) \).

4. **Limiting Behavior**: As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) of \( x \) tends to zero. This implies that \( x \) converges in distribution to a degenerate distribution at zero.

Thus, the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limiting distribution of the scalar value \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity. The setup is that \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), and \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns each of unit norm. The scalar \( x \) is defined as the average of \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) over all columns \( m \) from 1 to \( M \).

First, let me parse the problem. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector, meaning each component is a complex normal random variable, independent, with zero mean and unit variance. The matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns with unit norm, so each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) satisfies \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_m = 1 \), and for \( m \neq n \), \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). However, since \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \), if \( M &gt; N \), the columns can&#x27;t all be orthogonal in \( \mathbb{C}^N \). Wait, but orthogonal columns in an \( N \times M \) matrix require that \( M \leq N \), right? Because in a space of dimension \( N \), you can have at most \( N \) orthogonal vectors. So maybe in this problem, \( M \) is approaching infinity, but \( N \) is also going to infinity? Wait, the problem states that \( M \) approaches infinity, but it doesn&#x27;t specify the behavior of \( N \). Hmm, this is a bit unclear. If \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, that would require \( M \leq N \), so if \( M \) is going to infinity, then \( N \) must also be going to infinity. So perhaps in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, but with some relation? Or maybe \( N \) is fixed, and the question is ill-posed? Wait, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed. But then, how can \( \mathbf{A} \) have \( M \) orthogonal columns if \( M &gt; N \)? That&#x27;s impossible. So perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is semi-unitary, meaning that when \( M \leq N \), the columns are orthonormal, but here since \( M \) is approaching infinity, maybe \( N \) is also approaching infinity with \( M \), such that \( M/N \) approaches some constant? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous here.

Wait, let me check again. The problem states that \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So each column has unit norm, and different columns are orthogonal. So if \( M \leq N \), such a matrix can exist, but if \( M &gt; N \), it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, if \( M \) approaches infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity to allow \( M \leq N \). So likely, in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with \( M \leq N \), but the problem states &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is some function of \( M \), perhaps \( N \geq M \). However, since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify the relation between \( N \) and \( M \), perhaps we need to assume that \( N \) is fixed and \( M \leq N \), but then taking \( M \) to infinity would require \( N \) to be infinite as well, which is not possible. This seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows \( \mathbf{A} \) to have approximately orthogonal columns when \( M \) is large, but that&#x27;s not stated. The problem says &quot;orthogonal columns of unit norm&quot;, so strictly, they have to be exactly orthogonal. Therefore, I must conclude that \( M \leq N \), and as \( M \) approaches infinity, \( N \) must also approach infinity. So, perhaps we have a scenario where both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some fixed ratio. However, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, not specifying \( N \), so maybe the answer will depend on the relation between \( M \) and \( N \). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are not exactly orthogonal but asymptotically orthogonal as \( M \) increases? But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so maybe the problem is in a regime where \( N \) is growing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), but then as \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as well. But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the key here is to compute the distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \), regardless of \( N \). But given that \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns of unit norm, if \( M \to \infty \), then \( N \) must also go to infinity. So perhaps they are taking the limit as both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some ratio. If the problem is from a wireless communications context, like a massive MIMO scenario, then maybe \( M \) and \( N \) are both large but with a fixed ratio, say \( M/N \) approaching a constant. But since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify, maybe we can proceed assuming that \( N \) is fixed, but then \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem as stated might have an issue. Alternatively, maybe the columns are not exactly orthogonal but the inner product between different columns is zero in expectation or something like that? But the problem states orthogonal columns, so that&#x27;s not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, like a Haar-distributed matrix. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns, then each \( \mathbf{a}_m \) is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere, and independent of each other. Wait, but if the columns are orthogonal, then they are not independent, since orthogonal vectors are dependent. So in that case, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, then the distribution is such that the columns form an orthonormal basis, but in that case, the distribution is the Haar measure on the Stiefel manifold.

But in the problem statement, \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So unless specified otherwise, perhaps we can assume that the columns are arbitrary but fixed, except for \( \mathbf{g} \) which is random. Wait, but the problem says &quot;determine the limiting distribution of \( x \)&quot;, so the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \), or also over \( \mathbf{A} \)? The problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. So then, the problem is: for a given deterministic matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, compute the distribution of \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) as \( M \to \infty \). However, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, then \( x \) is a linear combination of Gaussian variables, so it&#x27;s Gaussian itself. Then, the question is about the mean and variance of \( x \), and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens.

But wait, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic with orthogonal columns, then the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent? Let&#x27;s see. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), so \( \mathbf{g}^H \) is a row vector with complex Gaussian entries. Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, the projections onto different \( \mathbf{a}_m \)&#x27;s are uncorrelated. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian, they are independent.

Therefore, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian random variable. Let me check. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), the inner product \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian variable. The mean is zero, because \( \mathbf{g} \) has zero mean. The variance is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_m = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{I} \mathbf{a}_m = \|\mathbf{a}_m\|^2 = 1 \), since each column has unit norm. Therefore, each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is distributed as \( CN(0,1) \). Furthermore, since the columns \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, for \( m \neq n \), the covariance between \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) and \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_n \) is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_n = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). Therefore, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent and identically distributed as \( CN(0,1) \).

Therefore, \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. Since they are independent, the sum would be \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), the variance becomes \( \frac{1}{M^2} \times M = \frac{1}{M} \). Therefore, \( x \sim CN\left(0, \frac{1}{M}\right) \). As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) tends to zero, so the distribution of \( x \) converges in probability to zero. In other words, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function at zero. But the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, which usually refers to convergence in distribution. However, if the variance is going to zero and the mean is zero, then the limiting distribution is a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me confirm. Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), so the real and imaginary parts are each \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/2) \). So when you take the average of \( M \) such terms, the real part is \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/(2M)) \) and the imaginary part is the same. So as \( M \to \infty \), both the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution, hence the entire complex random variable converges to zero in distribution.

But perhaps the problem expects a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem? Wait, but we are averaging independent complex Gaussians, so the average is also a complex Gaussian with decreasing variance. However, if we consider the real or imaginary part, each is a real Gaussian with variance \( 1/(2M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, hence the distribution becomes a delta function. So there&#x27;s a contradiction here: if we take the average of Gaussians with variance \( 1/M \), then yes, it tends to zero. However, maybe if \( N \) is also changing with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that.

Wait, the problem says \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \). If \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) must have orthogonal columns, which is impossible for \( M &gt; N \). Therefore, the problem might be in a regime where \( N \) is also increasing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), so \( \mathbf{A} \) is a square unitary matrix when \( M = N \). If \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as \( M \). Then, in that case, the columns are orthonormal, and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens to the average \( x \).

But even if \( N = M \), then each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), independent, so the average is \( CN(0, 1/M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), variance tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), as long as \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, and \( M \to \infty \), then \( x \) converges to zero in distribution.

But wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me check again. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns, then the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are in \( \mathbb{C}^N \) and are orthogonal. Therefore, if \( M \leq N \), they form an orthonormal set. If \( M &gt; N \), such a matrix cannot exist. Therefore, if the problem states \( M \) approaching infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity with \( M \leq N \). However, without loss of generality, if \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, the problem is ill-posed because \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem must assume that both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, perhaps with \( M = N \), or \( M \) growing proportionally to \( N \).

But the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed, but that&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is allowed to have approximately orthogonal columns? For example, in large MIMO systems, random matrices with independent columns are approximately orthogonal when the dimensions are large. But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so strictly orthogonal. Therefore, perhaps in the problem, \( N \) is also going to infinity with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this. Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \leq N \), but \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is fixed. Then as \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is finite, the limit is not infinity. So this is also problematic.

This is confusing. Maybe the key here is to note that regardless of the relation between \( M \) and \( N \), as long as the columns are orthogonal, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is independent, and the average tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a delta function at zero.

But let&#x27;s check with an example. Suppose \( N = 1 \), then \( \mathbf{A} \) would be a \( 1 \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns. But in \( \mathbb{C}^1 \), the only way to have orthogonal columns is that all columns are zero except one, but each column must have unit norm. Therefore, if \( N = 1 \), \( \mathbf{A} \) can only have one non-zero column, which is 1. Therefore, \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed 1. So if \( N = 1 \), \( M = 1 \). Therefore, if \( N \) is fixed, \( M \) can&#x27;t go to infinity. Therefore, the problem must have \( N \) going to infinity as \( M \) does. So in the limit, as \( M \to \infty \), \( N \to \infty \) as well. Then, even though each term is \( CN(0,1) \), the average of \( M \) terms is \( CN(0, 1/M) \), which tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), the average tends to zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with my independence assumption. Let&#x27;s consider if the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are not random but fixed. Then, the projections \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent because \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian and the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal. Therefore, even if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, as long as its columns are orthogonal, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent. Therefore, their average is a sum of independent Gaussians, which is Gaussian with variance scaling as \( 1/M \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, so the distribution becomes degenerate at zero.

Therefore, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta at zero, meaning that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero. But in terms of distribution, we might say that it converges in law to a constant, which has zero variance. So the answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

But wait, the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, so perhaps we need to state it as a normal distribution with variance zero, which is the same as a constant. In real analysis, the limiting distribution would be a degenerate normal distribution with mean zero and variance zero. So in that case, the limiting distribution is \( \delta_0 \), but in the context of complex distributions, it&#x27;s a complex normal distribution with zero mean and zero covariance.

But maybe the problem expects a different answer. Let me think again. Suppose the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are random, for example, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns (Haar distributed). Then, even though the columns are orthogonal, the randomness of \( \mathbf{A} \) could affect the distribution. However, the problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. Therefore, the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \).

Therefore, \( x \) is a sum of independent complex Gaussians divided by \( M \), leading to a complex Gaussian with variance \( 1/M \). As \( M \to \infty \), this tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a constant zero. However, in probability theory, convergence to a constant implies convergence in distribution to that constant. So the answer should be that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem, but since we are averaging Gaussians, the result is still Gaussian with variance decreasing to zero. So in the limit, it&#x27;s a constant. Therefore, the limiting distribution is deterministic zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \). Hence, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me check once more. Let&#x27;s suppose \( N \) is growing with \( M \), say \( N = M \). Then, \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( M \times M \) unitary matrix. Then, \( \mathbf{g} \) is an \( M \times 1 \) vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \). Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{A} \) is a row vector where each entry is \( CN(0,1) \), and the entries are independent because the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are orthonormal. Therefore, the average of these entries is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \), which is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \), where \( z_m \sim CN(0,1) \) iid. The sum \( \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \) is \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), we get \( CN(0, 1/M) \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), this converges in distribution to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is indeed a point mass at zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \) is a degenerate distribution at zero, which can be written as \( \delta_0 \). However, in the context of complex normal distributions, we can say that \( x \) converges in distribution to \( 0 \), which is equivalent to \( CN(0,0) \).

Alternatively, if we consider real and imaginary parts, each has variance \( 1/(2M) \), so as \( M \to \infty \), both variances go to zero, so the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution. Therefore, the conclusion is the same.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero, so \( x \) converges in probability and in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \).

**Final Answer**

Given an \( N \)-by-\( 1 \) complex Gaussian random vector \( \mathbf{g} \) with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \) and an \( N \)-by-\( M \) complex matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, we need to determine the limiting distribution of the scalar \( x \) defined as:
\[ x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \]
as \( M \) approaches infinity.

1. **Orthogonal Columns and Gaussian Vector**: Each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) of \( \mathbf{A} \) is orthogonal to others and has unit norm. The vector \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with independent components.

2. **Projection Analysis**: Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, these projections are uncorrelated and hence independent complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance (i.e., \( CN(0,1) \)).

3. **Sum of Independent Gaussians**: The scalar \( x \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. The sum of \( M \) such variables is \( CN(0, M) \), and dividing by \( M \) results in \( x \sim CN(0, \frac{1}{M}) \).

4. **Limiting Behavior**: As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) of \( x \) tends to zero. This implies that \( x \) converges in distribution to a degenerate distribution at zero.

Thus, the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

Response: Use the particle motion analogy: the stationary random variables corresponding to \( \mathbf{g} \) are the spins of the particle, and the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) correspond to the axes of the coordinate frame. A second way to think about the problem is that the events with low probabilities occur among the rows with low instantaneous weights. Limiting these probabilities as \( M \) increases provides the limiting distribution of the scalar \( x \):

This was like math problems for first graders to solve. Seriously. It would take five minutes to read to get me interested. Please, I&#x27;m begging, either make the homework harder (hint: you find them in stories), or make it harder to find (hint: make it cross-posted with 10 other sites in the sidebar, and no way to hide a page until a limit of 5 sources is reached) There are another 5 questions just like the first two with extremely basic information. Seriously.

I didn&#x27;t realize it was like this. Initially (still am) I was all \varepsilon-delta. Darn things. I gave anything for your ease and gratitude, except if its HARD as the hell, I&#x27;d probably rather not do it at all (at the moment, im meaning putting it off on the more &quot;interesting&quot; part of the day, specially because of homework usually is a nightmare too)

Case 1: You are a student since you take 3 courses at the same time. In that case, the question will take you a week to do... and you still have to do the homework for the other 13 pieces of homework.
Case 2: You are world&#x27;s best mathematician. In that case the question will take you a tenth of a second to do...
Case 3: You don&#x27;t care about your school, all you want is wacky homework. In that case, the question will take you??? seconds to do...

The first one is enough.

I think I&#x27;m on case 2. First thing first: questions should have &quot;enough&quot;. If you&#x27;re gonna ask us to do something hard, dont hold it back. And if they are easy, make them more numerous, till we accept that but when your keta asks for a whole different way of teaching, you gotta add difficulty to make it interesting.

I have just reminded myself of my undergraduate education. There&#x27;s no specific difficulty associated to the question, what you do is adjusting yourself to the difficulty of the question (insanely difficult, long-term project having acceptable end goal or medium difficulty having short-term goal accomplishment.). A course doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be sequential on terms of problems asking, what matters is that the first one is simple for the course it is part of. Isn&#x27;t it like that when you start a new coffee shop? The food you serve in the first week is fragile and easy for everyone to finish, but it gets complicated (which calibrates your cooker and teaches your workers) by the 30th time, when they serve you something better, and worse (beans).&lt;|end_of_text|&gt;          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limiting distribution of the scalar value \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity. The setup is that \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), and \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns each of unit norm. The scalar \( x \) is defined as the average of \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) over all columns \( m \) from 1 to \( M \).

First, let me parse the problem. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector, meaning each component is a complex normal random variable, independent, with zero mean and unit variance. The matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns with unit norm, so each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) satisfies \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_m = 1 \), and for \( m \neq n \), \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). However, since \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \), if \( M &gt; N \), the columns can&#x27;t all be orthogonal in \( \mathbb{C}^N \). Wait, but orthogonal columns in an \( N \times M \) matrix require that \( M \leq N \), right? Because in a space of dimension \( N \), you can have at most \( N \) orthogonal vectors. So maybe in this problem, \( M \) is approaching infinity, but \( N \) is also going to infinity? Wait, the problem states that \( M \) approaches infinity, but it doesn&#x27;t specify the behavior of \( N \). Hmm, this is a bit unclear. If \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, that would require \( M \leq N \), so if \( M \) is going to infinity, then \( N \) must also be going to infinity. So perhaps in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, but with some relation? Or maybe \( N \) is fixed, and the question is ill-posed? Wait, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed. But then, how can \( \mathbf{A} \) have \( M \) orthogonal columns if \( M &gt; N \)? That&#x27;s impossible. So perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is semi-unitary, meaning that when \( M \leq N \), the columns are orthonormal, but here since \( M \) is approaching infinity, maybe \( N \) is also approaching infinity with \( M \), such that \( M/N \) approaches some constant? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous here.

Wait, let me check again. The problem states that \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So each column has unit norm, and different columns are orthogonal. So if \( M \leq N \), such a matrix can exist, but if \( M &gt; N \), it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, if \( M \) approaches infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity to allow \( M \leq N \). So likely, in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with \( M \leq N \), but the problem states &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is some function of \( M \), perhaps \( N \geq M \). However, since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify the relation between \( N \) and \( M \), perhaps we need to assume that \( N \) is fixed and \( M \leq N \), but then taking \( M \) to infinity would require \( N \) to be infinite as well, which is not possible. This seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows \( \mathbf{A} \) to have approximately orthogonal columns when \( M \) is large, but that&#x27;s not stated. The problem says &quot;orthogonal columns of unit norm&quot;, so strictly, they have to be exactly orthogonal. Therefore, I must conclude that \( M \leq N \), and as \( M \) approaches infinity, \( N \) must also approach infinity. So, perhaps we have a scenario where both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some fixed ratio. However, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, not specifying \( N \), so maybe the answer will depend on the relation between \( M \) and \( N \). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are not exactly orthogonal but asymptotically orthogonal as \( M \) increases? But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so maybe the problem is in a regime where \( N \) is growing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), but then as \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as well. But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the key here is to compute the distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \), regardless of \( N \). But given that \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns of unit norm, if \( M \to \infty \), then \( N \) must also go to infinity. So perhaps they are taking the limit as both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some ratio. If the problem is from a wireless communications context, like a massive MIMO scenario, then maybe \( M \) and \( N \) are both large but with a fixed ratio, say \( M/N \) approaching a constant. But since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify, maybe we can proceed assuming that \( N \) is fixed, but then \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem as stated might have an issue. Alternatively, maybe the columns are not exactly orthogonal but the inner product between different columns is zero in expectation or something like that? But the problem states orthogonal columns, so that&#x27;s not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, like a Haar-distributed matrix. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns, then each \( \mathbf{a}_m \) is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere, and independent of each other. Wait, but if the columns are orthogonal, then they are not independent, since orthogonal vectors are dependent. So in that case, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, then the distribution is such that the columns form an orthonormal basis, but in that case, the distribution is the Haar measure on the Stiefel manifold.

But in the problem statement, \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So unless specified otherwise, perhaps we can assume that the columns are arbitrary but fixed, except for \( \mathbf{g} \) which is random. Wait, but the problem says &quot;determine the limiting distribution of \( x \)&quot;, so the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \), or also over \( \mathbf{A} \)? The problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. So then, the problem is: for a given deterministic matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, compute the distribution of \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) as \( M \to \infty \). However, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, then \( x \) is a linear combination of Gaussian variables, so it&#x27;s Gaussian itself. Then, the question is about the mean and variance of \( x \), and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens.

But wait, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic with orthogonal columns, then the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent? Let&#x27;s see. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), so \( \mathbf{g}^H \) is a row vector with complex Gaussian entries. Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, the projections onto different \( \mathbf{a}_m \)&#x27;s are uncorrelated. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian, they are independent.

Therefore, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian random variable. Let me check. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), the inner product \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian variable. The mean is zero, because \( \mathbf{g} \) has zero mean. The variance is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_m = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{I} \mathbf{a}_m = \|\mathbf{a}_m\|^2 = 1 \), since each column has unit norm. Therefore, each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is distributed as \( CN(0,1) \). Furthermore, since the columns \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, for \( m \neq n \), the covariance between \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) and \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_n \) is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_n = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). Therefore, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent and identically distributed as \( CN(0,1) \).

Therefore, \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. Since they are independent, the sum would be \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), the variance becomes \( \frac{1}{M^2} \times M = \frac{1}{M} \). Therefore, \( x \sim CN\left(0, \frac{1}{M}\right) \). As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) tends to zero, so the distribution of \( x \) converges in probability to zero. In other words, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function at zero. But the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, which usually refers to convergence in distribution. However, if the variance is going to zero and the mean is zero, then the limiting distribution is a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me confirm. Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), so the real and imaginary parts are each \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/2) \). So when you take the average of \( M \) such terms, the real part is \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/(2M)) \) and the imaginary part is the same. So as \( M \to \infty \), both the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution, hence the entire complex random variable converges to zero in distribution.

But perhaps the problem expects a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem? Wait, but we are averaging independent complex Gaussians, so the average is also a complex Gaussian with decreasing variance. However, if we consider the real or imaginary part, each is a real Gaussian with variance \( 1/(2M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, hence the distribution becomes a delta function. So there&#x27;s a contradiction here: if we take the average of Gaussians with variance \( 1/M \), then yes, it tends to zero. However, maybe if \( N \) is also changing with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that.

Wait, the problem says \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \). If \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) must have orthogonal columns, which is impossible for \( M &gt; N \). Therefore, the problem might be in a regime where \( N \) is also increasing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), so \( \mathbf{A} \) is a square unitary matrix when \( M = N \). If \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as \( M \). Then, in that case, the columns are orthonormal, and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens to the average \( x \).

But even if \( N = M \), then each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), independent, so the average is \( CN(0, 1/M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), variance tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), as long as \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, and \( M \to \infty \), then \( x \) converges to zero in distribution.

But wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me check again. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns, then the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are in \( \mathbb{C}^N \) and are orthogonal. Therefore, if \( M \leq N \), they form an orthonormal set. If \( M &gt; N \), such a matrix cannot exist. Therefore, if the problem states \( M \) approaching infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity with \( M \leq N \). However, without loss of generality, if \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, the problem is ill-posed because \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem must assume that both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, perhaps with \( M = N \), or \( M \) growing proportionally to \( N \).

But the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed, but that&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is allowed to have approximately orthogonal columns? For example, in large MIMO systems, random matrices with independent columns are approximately orthogonal when the dimensions are large. But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so strictly orthogonal. Therefore, perhaps in the problem, \( N \) is also going to infinity with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this. Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \leq N \), but \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is fixed. Then as \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is finite, the limit is not infinity. So this is also problematic.

This is confusing. Maybe the key here is to note that regardless of the relation between \( M \) and \( N \), as long as the columns are orthogonal, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is independent, and the average tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a delta function at zero.

But let&#x27;s check with an example. Suppose \( N = 1 \), then \( \mathbf{A} \) would be a \( 1 \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns. But in \( \mathbb{C}^1 \), the only way to have orthogonal columns is that all columns are zero except one, but each column must have unit norm. Therefore, if \( N = 1 \), \( \mathbf{A} \) can only have one non-zero column, which is 1. Therefore, \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed 1. So if \( N = 1 \), \( M = 1 \). Therefore, if \( N \) is fixed, \( M \) can&#x27;t go to infinity. Therefore, the problem must have \( N \) going to infinity as \( M \) does. So in the limit, as \( M \to \infty \), \( N \to \infty \) as well. Then, even though each term is \( CN(0,1) \), the average of \( M \) terms is \( CN(0, 1/M) \), which tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), the average tends to zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with my independence assumption. Let&#x27;s consider if the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are not random but fixed. Then, the projections \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent because \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian and the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal. Therefore, even if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, as long as its columns are orthogonal, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent. Therefore, their average is a sum of independent Gaussians, which is Gaussian with variance scaling as \( 1/M \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, so the distribution becomes degenerate at zero.

Therefore, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta at zero, meaning that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero. But in terms of distribution, we might say that it converges in law to a constant, which has zero variance. So the answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

But wait, the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, so perhaps we need to state it as a normal distribution with variance zero, which is the same as a constant. In real analysis, the limiting distribution would be a degenerate normal distribution with mean zero and variance zero. So in that case, the limiting distribution is \( \delta_0 \), but in the context of complex distributions, it&#x27;s a complex normal distribution with zero mean and zero covariance.

But maybe the problem expects a different answer. Let me think again. Suppose the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are random, for example, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns (Haar distributed). Then, even though the columns are orthogonal, the randomness of \( \mathbf{A} \) could affect the distribution. However, the problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. Therefore, the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \).

Therefore, \( x \) is a sum of independent complex Gaussians divided by \( M \), leading to a complex Gaussian with variance \( 1/M \). As \( M \to \infty \), this tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a constant zero. However, in probability theory, convergence to a constant implies convergence in distribution to that constant. So the answer should be that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem, but since we are averaging Gaussians, the result is still Gaussian with variance decreasing to zero. So in the limit, it&#x27;s a constant. Therefore, the limiting distribution is deterministic zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \). Hence, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me check once more. Let&#x27;s suppose \( N \) is growing with \( M \), say \( N = M \). Then, \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( M \times M \) unitary matrix. Then, \( \mathbf{g} \) is an \( M \times 1 \) vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \). Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{A} \) is a row vector where each entry is \( CN(0,1) \), and the entries are independent because the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are orthonormal. Therefore, the average of these entries is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \), which is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \), where \( z_m \sim CN(0,1) \) iid. The sum \( \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \) is \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), we get \( CN(0, 1/M) \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), this converges in distribution to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is indeed a point mass at zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \) is a degenerate distribution at zero, which can be written as \( \delta_0 \). However, in the context of complex normal distributions, we can say that \( x \) converges in distribution to \( 0 \), which is equivalent to \( CN(0,0) \).

Alternatively, if we consider real and imaginary parts, each has variance \( 1/(2M) \), so as \( M \to \infty \), both variances go to zero, so the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution. Therefore, the conclusion is the same.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero, so \( x \) converges in probability and in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \).

Given an \( N \)-by-\( 1 \) complex Gaussian random vector \( \mathbf{g} \) with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \) and an \( N \)-by-\( M \) complex matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, we need to determine the limiting distribution of the scalar \( x \) defined as:
\[ x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \]
as \( M \) approaches infinity.

1. **Orthogonal Columns and Gaussian Vector**: Each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) of \( \mathbf{A} \) is orthogonal to others and has unit norm. The vector \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with independent components.

2. **Projection Analysis**: Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, these projections are uncorrelated and hence independent complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance (i.e., \( CN(0,1) \)).

3. **Sum of Independent Gaussians**: The scalar \( x \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. The sum of \( M \) such variables is \( CN(0, M) \), and dividing by \( M \) results in \( x \sim CN(0, \frac{1}{M}) \).

4. **Limiting Behavior**: As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) of \( x \) tends to zero. This implies that \( x \) converges in distribution to a degenerate distribution at zero.

Thus, the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limiting distribution of the scalar value \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity. The setup is that \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), and \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns each of unit norm. The scalar \( x \) is defined as the average of \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) over all columns \( m \) from 1 to \( M \).

First, let me parse the problem. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector, meaning each component is a complex normal random variable, independent, with zero mean and unit variance. The matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns with unit norm, so each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) satisfies \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_m = 1 \), and for \( m \neq n \), \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). However, since \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \), if \( M &gt; N \), the columns can&#x27;t all be orthogonal in \( \mathbb{C}^N \). Wait, but orthogonal columns in an \( N \times M \) matrix require that \( M \leq N \), right? Because in a space of dimension \( N \), you can have at most \( N \) orthogonal vectors. So maybe in this problem, \( M \) is approaching infinity, but \( N \) is also going to infinity? Wait, the problem states that \( M \) approaches infinity, but it doesn&#x27;t specify the behavior of \( N \). Hmm, this is a bit unclear. If \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, that would require \( M \leq N \), so if \( M \) is going to infinity, then \( N \) must also be going to infinity. So perhaps in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, but with some relation? Or maybe \( N \) is fixed, and the question is ill-posed? Wait, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed. But then, how can \( \mathbf{A} \) have \( M \) orthogonal columns if \( M &gt; N \)? That&#x27;s impossible. So perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is semi-unitary, meaning that when \( M \leq N \), the columns are orthonormal, but here since \( M \) is approaching infinity, maybe \( N \) is also approaching infinity with \( M \), such that \( M/N \) approaches some constant? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous here.

Wait, let me check again. The problem states that \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So each column has unit norm, and different columns are orthogonal. So if \( M \leq N \), such a matrix can exist, but if \( M &gt; N \), it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, if \( M \) approaches infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity to allow \( M \leq N \). So likely, in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with \( M \leq N \), but the problem states &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is some function of \( M \), perhaps \( N \geq M \). However, since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify the relation between \( N \) and \( M \), perhaps we need to assume that \( N \) is fixed and \( M \leq N \), but then taking \( M \) to infinity would require \( N \) to be infinite as well, which is not possible. This seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows \( \mathbf{A} \) to have approximately orthogonal columns when \( M \) is large, but that&#x27;s not stated. The problem says &quot;orthogonal columns of unit norm&quot;, so strictly, they have to be exactly orthogonal. Therefore, I must conclude that \( M \leq N \), and as \( M \) approaches infinity, \( N \) must also approach infinity. So, perhaps we have a scenario where both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some fixed ratio. However, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, not specifying \( N \), so maybe the answer will depend on the relation between \( M \) and \( N \). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are not exactly orthogonal but asymptotically orthogonal as \( M \) increases? But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so maybe the problem is in a regime where \( N \) is growing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), but then as \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as well. But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the key here is to compute the distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \), regardless of \( N \). But given that \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns of unit norm, if \( M \to \infty \), then \( N \) must also go to infinity. So perhaps they are taking the limit as both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some ratio. If the problem is from a wireless communications context, like a massive MIMO scenario, then maybe \( M \) and \( N \) are both large but with a fixed ratio, say \( M/N \) approaching a constant. But since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify, maybe we can proceed assuming that \( N \) is fixed, but then \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem as stated might have an issue. Alternatively, maybe the columns are not exactly orthogonal but the inner product between different columns is zero in expectation or something like that? But the problem states orthogonal columns, so that&#x27;s not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, like a Haar-distributed matrix. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns, then each \( \mathbf{a}_m \) is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere, and independent of each other. Wait, but if the columns are orthogonal, then they are not independent, since orthogonal vectors are dependent. So in that case, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, then the distribution is such that the columns form an orthonormal basis, but in that case, the distribution is the Haar measure on the Stiefel manifold.

But in the problem statement, \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So unless specified otherwise, perhaps we can assume that the columns are arbitrary but fixed, except for \( \mathbf{g} \) which is random. Wait, but the problem says &quot;determine the limiting distribution of \( x \)&quot;, so the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \), or also over \( \mathbf{A} \)? The problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. So then, the problem is: for a given deterministic matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, compute the distribution of \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) as \( M \to \infty \). However, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, then \( x \) is a linear combination of Gaussian variables, so it&#x27;s Gaussian itself. Then, the question is about the mean and variance of \( x \), and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens.

But wait, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic with orthogonal columns, then the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent? Let&#x27;s see. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), so \( \mathbf{g}^H \) is a row vector with complex Gaussian entries. Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, the projections onto different \( \mathbf{a}_m \)&#x27;s are uncorrelated. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian, they are independent.

Therefore, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian random variable. Let me check. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), the inner product \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian variable. The mean is zero, because \( \mathbf{g} \) has zero mean. The variance is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_m = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{I} \mathbf{a}_m = \|\mathbf{a}_m\|^2 = 1 \), since each column has unit norm. Therefore, each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is distributed as \( CN(0,1) \). Furthermore, since the columns \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, for \( m \neq n \), the covariance between \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) and \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_n \) is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_n = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). Therefore, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent and identically distributed as \( CN(0,1) \).

Therefore, \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. Since they are independent, the sum would be \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), the variance becomes \( \frac{1}{M^2} \times M = \frac{1}{M} \). Therefore, \( x \sim CN\left(0, \frac{1}{M}\right) \). As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) tends to zero, so the distribution of \( x \) converges in probability to zero. In other words, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function at zero. But the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, which usually refers to convergence in distribution. However, if the variance is going to zero and the mean is zero, then the limiting distribution is a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me confirm. Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), so the real and imaginary parts are each \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/2) \). So when you take the average of \( M \) such terms, the real part is \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/(2M)) \) and the imaginary part is the same. So as \( M \to \infty \), both the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution, hence the entire complex random variable converges to zero in distribution.

But perhaps the problem expects a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem? Wait, but we are averaging independent complex Gaussians, so the average is also a complex Gaussian with decreasing variance. However, if we consider the real or imaginary part, each is a real Gaussian with variance \( 1/(2M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, hence the distribution becomes a delta function. So there&#x27;s a contradiction here: if we take the average of Gaussians with variance \( 1/M \), then yes, it tends to zero. However, maybe if \( N \) is also changing with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that.

Wait, the problem says \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \). If \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) must have orthogonal columns, which is impossible for \( M &gt; N \). Therefore, the problem might be in a regime where \( N \) is also increasing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), so \( \mathbf{A} \) is a square unitary matrix when \( M = N \). If \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as \( M \). Then, in that case, the columns are orthonormal, and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens to the average \( x \).

But even if \( N = M \), then each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), independent, so the average is \( CN(0, 1/M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), variance tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), as long as \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, and \( M \to \infty \), then \( x \) converges to zero in distribution.

But wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me check again. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns, then the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are in \( \mathbb{C}^N \) and are orthogonal. Therefore, if \( M \leq N \), they form an orthonormal set. If \( M &gt; N \), such a matrix cannot exist. Therefore, if the problem states \( M \) approaching infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity with \( M \leq N \). However, without loss of generality, if \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, the problem is ill-posed because \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem must assume that both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, perhaps with \( M = N \), or \( M \) growing proportionally to \( N \).

But the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed, but that&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is allowed to have approximately orthogonal columns? For example, in large MIMO systems, random matrices with independent columns are approximately orthogonal when the dimensions are large. But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so strictly orthogonal. Therefore, perhaps in the problem, \( N \) is also going to infinity with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this. Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \leq N \), but \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is fixed. Then as \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is finite, the limit is not infinity. So this is also problematic.

This is confusing. Maybe the key here is to note that regardless of the relation between \( M \) and \( N \), as long as the columns are orthogonal, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is independent, and the average tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a delta function at zero.

But let&#x27;s check with an example. Suppose \( N = 1 \), then \( \mathbf{A} \) would be a \( 1 \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns. But in \( \mathbb{C}^1 \), the only way to have orthogonal columns is that all columns are zero except one, but each column must have unit norm. Therefore, if \( N = 1 \), \( \mathbf{A} \) can only have one non-zero column, which is 1. Therefore, \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed 1. So if \( N = 1 \), \( M = 1 \). Therefore, if \( N \) is fixed, \( M \) can&#x27;t go to infinity. Therefore, the problem must have \( N \) going to infinity as \( M \) does. So in the limit, as \( M \to \infty \), \( N \to \infty \) as well. Then, even though each term is \( CN(0,1) \), the average of \( M \) terms is \( CN(0, 1/M) \), which tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), the average tends to zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with my independence assumption. Let&#x27;s consider if the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are not random but fixed. Then, the projections \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent because \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian and the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal. Therefore, even if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, as long as its columns are orthogonal, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent. Therefore, their average is a sum of independent Gaussians, which is Gaussian with variance scaling as \( 1/M \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, so the distribution becomes degenerate at zero.

Therefore, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta at zero, meaning that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero. But in terms of distribution, we might say that it converges in law to a constant, which has zero variance. So the answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

But wait, the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, so perhaps we need to state it as a normal distribution with variance zero, which is the same as a constant. In real analysis, the limiting distribution would be a degenerate normal distribution with mean zero and variance zero. So in that case, the limiting distribution is \( \delta_0 \), but in the context of complex distributions, it&#x27;s a complex normal distribution with zero mean and zero covariance.

But maybe the problem expects a different answer. Let me think again. Suppose the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are random, for example, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns (Haar distributed). Then, even though the columns are orthogonal, the randomness of \( \mathbf{A} \) could affect the distribution. However, the problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. Therefore, the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \).

Therefore, \( x \) is a sum of independent complex Gaussians divided by \( M \), leading to a complex Gaussian with variance \( 1/M \). As \( M \to \infty \), this tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a constant zero. However, in probability theory, convergence to a constant implies convergence in distribution to that constant. So the answer should be that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem, but since we are averaging Gaussians, the result is still Gaussian with variance decreasing to zero. So in the limit, it&#x27;s a constant. Therefore, the limiting distribution is deterministic zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \). Hence, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me check once more. Let&#x27;s suppose \( N \) is growing with \( M \), say \( N = M \). Then, \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( M \times M \) unitary matrix. Then, \( \mathbf{g} \) is an \( M \times 1 \) vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \). Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{A} \) is a row vector where each entry is \( CN(0,1) \), and the entries are independent because the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are orthonormal. Therefore, the average of these entries is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \), which is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \), where \( z_m \sim CN(0,1) \) iid. The sum \( \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \) is \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), we get \( CN(0, 1/M) \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), this converges in distribution to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is indeed a point mass at zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \) is a degenerate distribution at zero, which can be written as \( \delta_0 \). However, in the context of complex normal distributions, we can say that \( x \) converges in distribution to \( 0 \), which is equivalent to \( CN(0,0) \).

Alternatively, if we consider real and imaginary parts, each has variance \( 1/(2M) \), so as \( M \to \infty \), both variances go to zero, so the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution. Therefore, the conclusion is the same.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero, so \( x \) converges in probability and in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \).

Given an \( N \)-by-\( 1 \) complex Gaussian random vector \( \mathbf{g} \) with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \) and an \( N \)-by-\( M \) complex matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, we need to determine the limiting distribution of the scalar \( x \) defined as:
\[ x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \]
as \( M \) approaches infinity.

1. **Orthogonal Columns and Gaussian Vector**: Each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) of \( \mathbf{A} \) is orthogonal to others and has unit norm. The vector \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with independent components.

2. **Projection Analysis**: Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, these projections are uncorrelated and hence independent complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance (i.e., \( CN(0,1) \)).

3. **Sum of Independent Gaussians**: The scalar \( x \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. The sum of \( M \) such variables is \( CN(0, M) \), and dividing by \( M \) results in \( x \sim CN(0, \frac{1}{M}) \).

4. **Limiting Behavior**: As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) of \( x \) tends to zero. This implies that \( x \) converges in distribution to a degenerate distribution at zero.

Thus, the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limiting distribution of the scalar value \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity. The setup is that \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), and \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns each of unit norm. The scalar \( x \) is defined as the average of \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) over all columns \( m \) from 1 to \( M \).

First, let me parse the problem. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector, meaning each component is a complex normal random variable, independent, with zero mean and unit variance. The matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns with unit norm, so each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) satisfies \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_m = 1 \), and for \( m \neq n \), \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). However, since \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \), if \( M &gt; N \), the columns can&#x27;t all be orthogonal in \( \mathbb{C}^N \). Wait, but orthogonal columns in an \( N \times M \) matrix require that \( M \leq N \), right? Because in a space of dimension \( N \), you can have at most \( N \) orthogonal vectors. So maybe in this problem, \( M \) is approaching infinity, but \( N \) is also going to infinity? Wait, the problem states that \( M \) approaches infinity, but it doesn&#x27;t specify the behavior of \( N \). Hmm, this is a bit unclear. If \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, that would require \( M \leq N \), so if \( M \) is going to infinity, then \( N \) must also be going to infinity. So perhaps in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, but with some relation? Or maybe \( N \) is fixed, and the question is ill-posed? Wait, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed. But then, how can \( \mathbf{A} \) have \( M \) orthogonal columns if \( M &gt; N \)? That&#x27;s impossible. So perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is semi-unitary, meaning that when \( M \leq N \), the columns are orthonormal, but here since \( M \) is approaching infinity, maybe \( N \) is also approaching infinity with \( M \), such that \( M/N \) approaches some constant? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous here.

Wait, let me check again. The problem states that \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So each column has unit norm, and different columns are orthogonal. So if \( M \leq N \), such a matrix can exist, but if \( M &gt; N \), it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, if \( M \) approaches infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity to allow \( M \leq N \). So likely, in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with \( M \leq N \), but the problem states &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is some function of \( M \), perhaps \( N \geq M \). However, since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify the relation between \( N \) and \( M \), perhaps we need to assume that \( N \) is fixed and \( M \leq N \), but then taking \( M \) to infinity would require \( N \) to be infinite as well, which is not possible. This seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows \( \mathbf{A} \) to have approximately orthogonal columns when \( M \) is large, but that&#x27;s not stated. The problem says &quot;orthogonal columns of unit norm&quot;, so strictly, they have to be exactly orthogonal. Therefore, I must conclude that \( M \leq N \), and as \( M \) approaches infinity, \( N \) must also approach infinity. So, perhaps we have a scenario where both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some fixed ratio. However, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, not specifying \( N \), so maybe the answer will depend on the relation between \( M \) and \( N \). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are not exactly orthogonal but asymptotically orthogonal as \( M \) increases? But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so maybe the problem is in a regime where \( N \) is growing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), but then as \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as well. But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the key here is to compute the distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \), regardless of \( N \). But given that \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns of unit norm, if \( M \to \infty \), then \( N \) must also go to infinity. So perhaps they are taking the limit as both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some ratio. If the problem is from a wireless communications context, like a massive MIMO scenario, then maybe \( M \) and \( N \) are both large but with a fixed ratio, say \( M/N \) approaching a constant. But since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify, maybe we can proceed assuming that \( N \) is fixed, but then \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem as stated might have an issue. Alternatively, maybe the columns are not exactly orthogonal but the inner product between different columns is zero in expectation or something like that? But the problem states orthogonal columns, so that&#x27;s not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, like a Haar-distributed matrix. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns, then each \( \mathbf{a}_m \) is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere, and independent of each other. Wait, but if the columns are orthogonal, then they are not independent, since orthogonal vectors are dependent. So in that case, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, then the distribution is such that the columns form an orthonormal basis, but in that case, the distribution is the Haar measure on the Stiefel manifold.

But in the problem statement, \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So unless specified otherwise, perhaps we can assume that the columns are arbitrary but fixed, except for \( \mathbf{g} \) which is random. Wait, but the problem says &quot;determine the limiting distribution of \( x \)&quot;, so the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \), or also over \( \mathbf{A} \)? The problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. So then, the problem is: for a given deterministic matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, compute the distribution of \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) as \( M \to \infty \). However, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, then \( x \) is a linear combination of Gaussian variables, so it&#x27;s Gaussian itself. Then, the question is about the mean and variance of \( x \), and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens.

But wait, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic with orthogonal columns, then the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent? Let&#x27;s see. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), so \( \mathbf{g}^H \) is a row vector with complex Gaussian entries. Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, the projections onto different \( \mathbf{a}_m \)&#x27;s are uncorrelated. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian, they are independent.

Therefore, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian random variable. Let me check. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), the inner product \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian variable. The mean is zero, because \( \mathbf{g} \) has zero mean. The variance is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_m = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{I} \mathbf{a}_m = \|\mathbf{a}_m\|^2 = 1 \), since each column has unit norm. Therefore, each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is distributed as \( CN(0,1) \). Furthermore, since the columns \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, for \( m \neq n \), the covariance between \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) and \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_n \) is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_n = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). Therefore, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent and identically distributed as \( CN(0,1) \).

Therefore, \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. Since they are independent, the sum would be \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), the variance becomes \( \frac{1}{M^2} \times M = \frac{1}{M} \). Therefore, \( x \sim CN\left(0, \frac{1}{M}\right) \). As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) tends to zero, so the distribution of \( x \) converges in probability to zero. In other words, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function at zero. But the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, which usually refers to convergence in distribution. However, if the variance is going to zero and the mean is zero, then the limiting distribution is a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me confirm. Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), so the real and imaginary parts are each \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/2) \). So when you take the average of \( M \) such terms, the real part is \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/(2M)) \) and the imaginary part is the same. So as \( M \to \infty \), both the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution, hence the entire complex random variable converges to zero in distribution.

But perhaps the problem expects a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem? Wait, but we are averaging independent complex Gaussians, so the average is also a complex Gaussian with decreasing variance. However, if we consider the real or imaginary part, each is a real Gaussian with variance \( 1/(2M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, hence the distribution becomes a delta function. So there&#x27;s a contradiction here: if we take the average of Gaussians with variance \( 1/M \), then yes, it tends to zero. However, maybe if \( N \) is also changing with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that.

Wait, the problem says \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \). If \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) must have orthogonal columns, which is impossible for \( M &gt; N \). Therefore, the problem might be in a regime where \( N \) is also increasing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), so \( \mathbf{A} \) is a square unitary matrix when \( M = N \). If \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as \( M \). Then, in that case, the columns are orthonormal, and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens to the average \( x \).

But even if \( N = M \), then each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), independent, so the average is \( CN(0, 1/M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), variance tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), as long as \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, and \( M \to \infty \), then \( x \) converges to zero in distribution.

But wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me check again. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns, then the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are in \( \mathbb{C}^N \) and are orthogonal. Therefore, if \( M \leq N \), they form an orthonormal set. If \( M &gt; N \), such a matrix cannot exist. Therefore, if the problem states \( M \) approaching infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity with \( M \leq N \). However, without loss of generality, if \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, the problem is ill-posed because \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem must assume that both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, perhaps with \( M = N \), or \( M \) growing proportionally to \( N \).

But the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed, but that&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is allowed to have approximately orthogonal columns? For example, in large MIMO systems, random matrices with independent columns are approximately orthogonal when the dimensions are large. But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so strictly orthogonal. Therefore, perhaps in the problem, \( N \) is also going to infinity with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this. Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \leq N \), but \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is fixed. Then as \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is finite, the limit is not infinity. So this is also problematic.

This is confusing. Maybe the key here is to note that regardless of the relation between \( M \) and \( N \), as long as the columns are orthogonal, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is independent, and the average tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a delta function at zero.

But let&#x27;s check with an example. Suppose \( N = 1 \), then \( \mathbf{A} \) would be a \( 1 \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns. But in \( \mathbb{C}^1 \), the only way to have orthogonal columns is that all columns are zero except one, but each column must have unit norm. Therefore, if \( N = 1 \), \( \mathbf{A} \) can only have one non-zero column, which is 1. Therefore, \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed 1. So if \( N = 1 \), \( M = 1 \). Therefore, if \( N \) is fixed, \( M \) can&#x27;t go to infinity. Therefore, the problem must have \( N \) going to infinity as \( M \) does. So in the limit, as \( M \to \infty \), \( N \to \infty \) as well. Then, even though each term is \( CN(0,1) \), the average of \( M \) terms is \( CN(0, 1/M) \), which tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), the average tends to zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with my independence assumption. Let&#x27;s consider if the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are not random but fixed. Then, the projections \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent because \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian and the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal. Therefore, even if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, as long as its columns are orthogonal, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent. Therefore, their average is a sum of independent Gaussians, which is Gaussian with variance scaling as \( 1/M \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, so the distribution becomes degenerate at zero.

Therefore, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta at zero, meaning that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero. But in terms of distribution, we might say that it converges in law to a constant, which has zero variance. So the answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

But wait, the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, so perhaps we need to state it as a normal distribution with variance zero, which is the same as a constant. In real analysis, the limiting distribution would be a degenerate normal distribution with mean zero and variance zero. So in that case, the limiting distribution is \( \delta_0 \), but in the context of complex distributions, it&#x27;s a complex normal distribution with zero mean and zero covariance.

But maybe the problem expects a different answer. Let me think again. Suppose the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are random, for example, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns (Haar distributed). Then, even though the columns are orthogonal, the randomness of \( \mathbf{A} \) could affect the distribution. However, the problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. Therefore, the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \).

Therefore, \( x \) is a sum of independent complex Gaussians divided by \( M \), leading to a complex Gaussian with variance \( 1/M \). As \( M \to \infty \), this tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a constant zero. However, in probability theory, convergence to a constant implies convergence in distribution to that constant. So the answer should be that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem, but since we are averaging Gaussians, the result is still Gaussian with variance decreasing to zero. So in the limit, it&#x27;s a constant. Therefore, the limiting distribution is deterministic zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \). Hence, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me check once more. Let&#x27;s suppose \( N \) is growing with \( M \), say \( N = M \). Then, \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( M \times M \) unitary matrix. Then, \( \mathbf{g} \) is an \( M \times 1 \) vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \). Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{A} \) is a row vector where each entry is \( CN(0,1) \), and the entries are independent because the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are orthonormal. Therefore, the average of these entries is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \), which is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \), where \( z_m \sim CN(0,1) \) iid. The sum \( \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \) is \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), we get \( CN(0, 1/M) \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), this converges in distribution to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is indeed a point mass at zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \) is a degenerate distribution at zero, which can be written as \( \delta_0 \). However, in the context of complex normal distributions, we can say that \( x \) converges in distribution to \( 0 \), which is equivalent to \( CN(0,0) \).

Alternatively, if we consider real and imaginary parts, each has variance \( 1/(2M) \), so as \( M \to \infty \), both variances go to zero, so the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution. Therefore, the conclusion is the same.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero, so \( x \) converges in probability and in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given an \( N \)-by-\( 1 \) complex Gaussian random vector \( \mathbf{g} \) with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \) and an \( N \)-by-\( M \) complex matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, we need to determine the limiting distribution of the scalar \( x \) defined as:
\[ x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \]
as \( M \) approaches infinity.

1. **Orthogonal Columns and Gaussian Vector**: Each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) of \( \mathbf{A} \) is orthogonal to others and has unit norm. The vector \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with independent components.

2. **Projection Analysis**: Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, these projections are uncorrelated and hence independent complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance (i.e., \( CN(0,1) \)).

3. **Sum of Independent Gaussians**: The scalar \( x \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. The sum of \( M \) such variables is \( CN(0, M) \), and dividing by \( M \) results in \( x \sim CN(0, \frac{1}{M}) \).

4. **Limiting Behavior**: As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) of \( x \) tends to zero. This implies that \( x \) converges in distribution to a degenerate distribution at zero.

Thus, the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

If \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, that would require \( M \leq N \), so if \( M \) is going to infinity, then \( N \) must also be going to infinity. So perhaps in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, but with some relation? Or maybe \( N \) is fixed, and the question is ill-posed? Wait, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed. But then, how can \( \mathbf{A} \) have \( M \) orthogonal columns if \( M &gt; N \)? That&#x27;s impossible. So perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is semi-unitary, meaning that when \( M \leq N \), the columns are orthonormal, but here since \( M \) is approaching infinity, maybe \( N \) is also approaching infinity with \( M \), such that \( M/N \) approaches some constant? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous here.

Wait, let me check again. The problem states that \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So each column has unit norm, and different columns are orthogonal. So if \( M \leq N \), such a matrix can exist, but if \( M &gt; N \), it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, if \( M \) approaches infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity to allow \( M \leq N \). So likely, in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with \( M \leq N \), but the problem states &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is some function of \( M \), perhaps \( N \geq M \). However, since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify the relation between \( N \) and \( M \), perhaps we need to assume that \( N \) is fixed and \( M \leq N \), but then taking \( M \) to infinity would require \( N \) to be infinite as well, which is not possible. This seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows \( \mathbf{A} \) to have approximately orthogonal columns when \( M \) is large, but that&#x27;s not stated. The problem says &quot;orthogonal columns of unit norm&quot;, so strictly, they have to be exactly orthogonal. Therefore, I must conclude that \( M \leq N \), and as \( M \) approaches infinity, \( N \) must also approach infinity. So, perhaps we have a scenario where both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some fixed ratio. However, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, not specifying \( N \), so maybe the answer will depend on the relation between \( M \) and \( N \). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are not exactly orthogonal but asymptotically orthogonal as \( M \) increases? But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so maybe the problem is in a regime where \( N \) is growing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), but then as \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as well. But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the key here is to compute the distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \), regardless of \( N \). But given that \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns of unit norm, if \( M \to \infty \), then \( N \) must also go to infinity. So perhaps they are taking the limit as both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some ratio. If the problem is from a wireless communications context, like a massive MIMO scenario, then maybe \( M \) and \( N \) are both large but with a fixed ratio, say \( M/N \) approaching a constant. But since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify, maybe we can proceed assuming that \( N \) is fixed, but then \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem as stated might have an issue. Alternatively, maybe the columns are not exactly orthogonal but the inner product between different columns is zero in expectation or something like that? But the problem states orthogonal columns, so that&#x27;s not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, like a Haar-distributed matrix. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns, then each \( \mathbf{a}_m \) is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere, and independent of each other. Wait, but if the columns are orthogonal, then they are not independent, since orthogonal vectors are dependent. So in that case, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, then the distribution is such that the columns form an orthonormal basis, but in that case, the distribution is the Haar measure on the Stiefel manifold.

But in the problem statement, \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So unless specified otherwise, perhaps we can assume that the columns are arbitrary but fixed, except for \( \mathbf{g} \) which is random. Wait, but the problem says &quot;determine the limiting distribution of \( x \)&quot;, so the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \), or also over \( \mathbf{A} \)? The problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. So then, the problem is: for a given deterministic matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, compute the distribution of \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) as \( M \to \infty \). However, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, then \( x \) is a linear combination of Gaussian variables, so it&#x27;s Gaussian itself. Then, the question is about the mean and variance of \( x \), and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens.

But wait, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic with orthogonal columns, then the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent? Let&#x27;s see. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), so \( \mathbf{g}^H \) is a row vector with complex Gaussian entries. Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, the projections onto different \( \mathbf{a}_m \)&#x27;s are uncorrelated. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian, they are independent.

Therefore, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian random variable. Let me check. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), the inner product \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian variable. The mean is zero, because \( \mathbf{g} \) has zero mean. The variance is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_m = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{I} \mathbf{a}_m = \|\mathbf{a}_m\|^2 = 1 \), since each column has unit norm. Therefore, each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is distributed as \( CN(0,1) \). Furthermore, since the columns \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, for \( m \neq n \), the covariance between \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) and \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_n \) is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_n = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). Therefore, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent and identically distributed as \( CN(0,1) \).

Therefore, \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. Since they are independent, the sum would be \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), the variance becomes \( \frac{1}{M^2} \times M = \frac{1}{M} \). Therefore, \( x \sim CN\left(0, \frac{1}{M}\right) \). As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) tends to zero, so the distribution of \( x \) converges in probability to zero. In other words, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function at zero. But the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, which usually refers to convergence in distribution. However, if the variance is going to zero and the mean is zero, then the limiting distribution is a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me confirm. Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), so the real and imaginary parts are each \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/2) \). So when you take the average of \( M \) such terms, the real part is \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/(2M)) \) and the imaginary part is the same. So as \( M \to \infty \), both the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution, hence the entire complex random variable converges to zero in distribution.

But perhaps the problem expects a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem? Wait, but we are averaging independent complex Gaussians, so the average is also a complex Gaussian with decreasing variance. However, if we consider the real or imaginary part, each is a real Gaussian with variance \( 1/(2M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, hence the distribution becomes a delta function. So there&#x27;s a contradiction here: if we take the average of Gaussians with variance \( 1/M \), then yes, it tends to zero. However, maybe if \( N \) is also changing with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that.

Wait, the problem says \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \). If \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) must have orthogonal columns, which is impossible for \( M &gt; N \). Therefore, the problem might be in a regime where \( N \) is also increasing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), so \( \mathbf{A} \) is a square unitary matrix when \( M = N \). If \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as \( M \). Then, in that case, the columns are orthonormal, and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens to the average \( x \).

But even if \( N = M \), then each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), independent, so the average is \( CN(0, 1/M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), variance tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), as long as \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, and \( M \to \infty \), then \( x \) converges to zero in distribution.

But wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me check again. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns, then the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are in \( \mathbb{C}^N \) and are orthogonal. Therefore, if \( M \leq N \), they form an orthonormal set. If \( M &gt; N \), such a matrix cannot exist. Therefore, if the problem states \( M \) approaching infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity with \( M \leq N \). However, without loss of generality, if \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, the problem is ill-posed because \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem must assume that both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, perhaps with \( M = N \), or \( M \) growing proportionally to \( N \).

But the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed, but that&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is allowed to have approximately orthogonal columns? For example, in large MIMO systems, random matrices with independent columns are approximately orthogonal when the dimensions are large. But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so strictly orthogonal. Therefore, perhaps in the problem, \( N \) is also going to infinity with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this. Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \leq N \), but \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is fixed. Then as \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is finite, the limit is not infinity. So this is also problematic.

This is confusing. Maybe the key here is to note that regardless of the relation between \( M \) and \( N \), as long as the columns are orthogonal, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is independent, and the average tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a delta function at zero.

But let&#x27;s check with an example. Suppose \( N = 1 \), then \( \mathbf{A} \) would be a \( 1 \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns. But in \( \mathbb{C}^1 \), the only way to have orthogonal columns is that all columns are zero except one, but each column must have unit norm. Therefore, if \( N = 1 \), \( \mathbf{A} \) can only have one non-zero column, which is 1. Therefore, \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed 1. So if \( N = 1 \), \( M = 1 \). Therefore, if \( N \) is fixed, \( M \) can&#x27;t go to infinity. Therefore, the problem must have \( N \) going to infinity as \( M \) does. So in the limit, as \( M \to \infty \), \( N \to \infty \) as well. Then, even though each term is \( CN(0,1) \), the average of \( M \) terms is \( CN(0, 1/M) \), which tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), the average tends to zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with my independence assumption. Let&#x27;s consider if the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are not random but fixed. Then, the projections \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent because \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian and the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal. Therefore, even if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, as long as its columns are orthogonal, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent. Therefore, their average is a sum of independent Gaussians, which is Gaussian with variance scaling as \( 1/M \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, so the distribution becomes degenerate at zero.

Therefore, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta at zero, meaning that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero. But in terms of distribution, we might say that it converges in law to a constant, which has zero variance. So the answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

But wait, the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, so perhaps we need to state it as a normal distribution with variance zero, which is the same as a constant. In real analysis, the limiting distribution would be a degenerate normal distribution with mean zero and variance zero. So in that case, the limiting distribution is \( \delta_0 \), but in the context of complex distributions, it&#x27;s a complex normal distribution with zero mean and zero covariance.

But maybe the problem expects a different answer. Let me think again. Suppose the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are random, for example, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns (Haar distributed). Then, even though the columns are orthogonal, the randomness of \( \mathbf{A} \) could affect the distribution. However, the problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. Therefore, the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \).

Therefore, \( x \) is a sum of independent complex Gaussians divided by \( M \), leading to a complex Gaussian with variance \( 1/M \). As \( M \to \infty \), this tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a constant zero. However, in probability theory, convergence to a constant implies convergence in distribution to that constant. So the answer should be that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem, but since we are averaging Gaussians, the result is still Gaussian with variance decreasing to zero. So in the limit, it&#x27;s a constant. Therefore, the limiting distribution is deterministic zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \). Hence, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me check once more. Let&#x27;s suppose \( N \) is growing with \( M \), say \( N = M \). Then, \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( M \times M \) unitary matrix. Then, \( \mathbf{g} \) is an \( M \times 1 \) vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \). Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{A} \) is a row vector where each entry is \( CN(0,1) \), and the entries are independent because the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are orthonormal. Therefore, the average of these entries is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \), which is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \), where \( z_m \sim CN(0,1) \) iid. The sum \( \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \) is \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), we get \( CN(0, 1/M) \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), this converges in distribution to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is indeed a point mass at zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \) is a degenerate distribution at zero, which can be written as \( \delta_0 \). However, in the context of complex normal distributions, we can say that \( x \) converges in distribution to \( 0 \), which is equivalent to \( CN(0,0) \).

Alternatively, if we consider real and imaginary parts, each has variance \( 1/(2M) \), so as \( M \to \infty \), both variances go to zero, so the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution. Therefore, the conclusion is the same.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero, so \( x \) converges in probability and in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given an \( N \)-by-\( 1 \) complex Gaussian random vector \( \mathbf{g} \) with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \) and an \( N \)-by-\( M \) complex matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, we need to determine the limiting distribution of the scalar \( x \) defined as:
\[ x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \]
as \( M \) approaches infinity.

1. **Orthogonal Columns and Gaussian Vector**: Each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) of \( \mathbf{A} \) is orthogonal to others and has unit norm. The vector \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with independent components.

2. **Projection Analysis**: Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, these projections are uncorrelated and hence independent complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance (i.e., \( CN(0,1) \)).

3. **Sum of Independent Gaussians**: The scalar \( x \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. The sum of \( M \) such variables is \( CN(0, M) \), and dividing by \( M \) results in \( x \sim CN(0, \frac{1}{M}) \).

4. **Limiting Behavior**: As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) of \( x \) tends to zero. This implies that \( x \) converges in distribution to a degenerate distribution at zero.

Thus, the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

Problem: Determine the limiting distribution of the scalar value \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity, where \( \mathbf{g} \) is an \( N \)-by-\( 1 \) complex Gaussian random vector with a \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \) distribution, and \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \)-by-\( M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm.

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limiting distribution of the scalar value \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity. The setup is that \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), and \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns each of unit norm. The scalar \( x \) is defined as the average of \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) over all columns \( m \) from 1 to \( M \).

First, let me parse the problem. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector, meaning each component is a complex normal random variable, independent, with zero mean and unit variance. The matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns with unit norm, so each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) satisfies \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_m = 1 \), and for \( m \neq n \), \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). However, since \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \), if \( M &gt; N \), the columns can&#x27;t all be orthogonal in \( \mathbb{C}^N \). Wait, but orthogonal columns in an \( N \times M \) matrix require that \( M \leq N \), right? Because in a space of dimension \( N \), you can have at most \( N \) orthogonal vectors. So maybe in this problem, \( M \) is approaching infinity, but \( N \) is also going to infinity? Wait, the problem states that \( M \) approaches infinity, but it doesn&#x27;t specify the behavior of \( N \). Hmm, this is a bit unclear. If \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, that would require \( M \leq N \), so if \( M \) is going to infinity, then \( N \) must also be going to infinity. So perhaps in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, but with some relation? Or maybe \( N \) is fixed, and the question is ill-posed? Wait, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed. But then, how can \( \mathbf{A} \) have \( M \) orthogonal columns if \( M &gt; N \)? That&#x27;s impossible. So perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is semi-unitary, meaning that when \( M \leq N \), the columns are orthonormal, but here since \( M \) is approaching infinity, maybe \( N \) is also approaching infinity with \( M \), such that \( M/N \) approaches some constant? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous here.

Wait, let me check again. The problem states that \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So each column has unit norm, and different columns are orthogonal. So if \( M \leq N \), such a matrix can exist, but if \( M &gt; N \), it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, if \( M \) approaches infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity to allow \( M \leq N \). So likely, in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with \( M \leq N \), but the problem states &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is some function of \( M \), perhaps \( N \geq M \). However, since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify the relation between \( N \) and \( M \), perhaps we need to assume that \( N \) is fixed and \( M \leq N \), but then taking \( M \) to infinity would require \( N \) to be infinite as well, which is not possible. This seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows \( \mathbf{A} \) to have approximately orthogonal columns when \( M \) is large, but that&#x27;s not stated. The problem says &quot;orthogonal columns of unit norm&quot;, so strictly, they have to be exactly orthogonal. Therefore, I must conclude that \( M \leq N \), and as \( M \) approaches infinity, \( N \) must also approach infinity. So, perhaps we have a scenario where both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some fixed ratio. However, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, not specifying \( N \), so maybe the answer will depend on the relation between \( M \) and \( N \). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are not exactly orthogonal but asymptotically orthogonal as \( M \) increases? But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so maybe the problem is in a regime where \( N \) is growing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), but then as \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as well. But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the key here is to compute the distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \), regardless of \( N \). But given that \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns of unit norm, if \( M \to \infty \), then \( N \) must also go to infinity. So perhaps they are taking the limit as both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some ratio. If the problem is from a wireless communications context, like a massive MIMO scenario, then maybe \( M \) and \( N \) are both large but with a fixed ratio, say \( M/N \) approaching a constant. But since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify, maybe we can proceed assuming that \( N \) is fixed, but then \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem as stated might have an issue. Alternatively, maybe the columns are not exactly orthogonal but the inner product between different columns is zero in expectation or something like that? But the problem states orthogonal columns, so that&#x27;s not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, like a Haar-distributed matrix. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns, then each \( \mathbf{a}_m \) is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere, and independent of each other. Wait, but if the columns are orthogonal, then they are not independent, since orthogonal vectors are dependent. So in that case, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, then the distribution is such that the columns form an orthonormal basis, but in that case, the distribution is the Haar measure on the Stiefel manifold.

But in the problem statement, \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So unless specified otherwise, perhaps we can assume that the columns are arbitrary but fixed, except for \( \mathbf{g} \) which is random. Wait, but the problem says &quot;determine the limiting distribution of \( x \)&quot;, so the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \), or also over \( \mathbf{A} \)? The problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. So then, the problem is: for a given deterministic matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, compute the distribution of \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) as \( M \to \infty \). However, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, then \( x \) is a linear combination of Gaussian variables, so it&#x27;s Gaussian itself. Then, the question is about the mean and variance of \( x \), and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens.

But wait, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic with orthogonal columns, then the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent? Let&#x27;s see. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), so \( \mathbf{g}^H \) is a row vector with complex Gaussian entries. Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, the projections onto different \( \mathbf{a}_m \)&#x27;s are uncorrelated. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian, they are independent.

Therefore, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian random variable. Let me check. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), the inner product \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian variable. The mean is zero, because \( \mathbf{g} \) has zero mean. The variance is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_m = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{I} \mathbf{a}_m = \|\mathbf{a}_m\|^2 = 1 \), since each column has unit norm. Therefore, each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is distributed as \( CN(0,1) \). Furthermore, since the columns \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, for \( m \neq n \), the covariance between \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) and \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_n \) is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_n = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). Therefore, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent and identically distributed as \( CN(0,1) \).

Therefore, \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. Since they are independent, the sum would be \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), the variance becomes \( \frac{1}{M^2} \times M = \frac{1}{M} \). Therefore, \( x \sim CN\left(0, \frac{1}{M}\right) \). As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) tends to zero, so the distribution of \( x \) converges in probability to zero. In other words, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function at zero. But the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, which usually refers to convergence in distribution. However, if the variance is going to zero and the mean is zero, then the limiting distribution is a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me confirm. Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), so the real and imaginary parts are each \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/2) \). So when you take the average of \( M \) such terms, the real part is \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/(2M)) \) and the imaginary part is the same. So as \( M \to \infty \), both the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution, hence the entire complex random variable converges to zero in distribution.

But perhaps the problem expects a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem? Wait, but we are averaging independent complex Gaussians, so the average is also a complex Gaussian with decreasing variance. However, if we consider the real or imaginary part, each is a real Gaussian with variance \( 1/(2M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, hence the distribution becomes a delta function. So there&#x27;s a contradiction here: if we take the average of Gaussians with variance \( 1/M \), then yes, it tends to zero. However, maybe if \( N \) is also changing with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that.

Wait, the problem says \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \). If \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) must have orthogonal columns, which is impossible for \( M &gt; N \). Therefore, the problem might be in a regime where \( N \) is also increasing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), so \( \mathbf{A} \) is a square unitary matrix when \( M = N \). If \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as \( M \). Then, in that case, the columns are orthonormal, and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens to the average \( x \).

But even if \( N = M \), then each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), independent, so the average is \( CN(0, 1/M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), variance tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), as long as \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, and \( M \to \infty \), then \( x \) converges to zero in distribution.

But wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me check again. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns, then the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are in \( \mathbb{C}^N \) and are orthogonal. Therefore, if \( M \leq N \), they form an orthonormal set. If \( M &gt; N \), such a matrix cannot exist. Therefore, if the problem states \( M \) approaching infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity with \( M \leq N \). However, without loss of generality, if \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, the problem is ill-posed because \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem must assume that both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, perhaps with \( M = N \), or \( M \) growing proportionally to \( N \).

But the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed, but that&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is allowed to have approximately orthogonal columns? For example, in large MIMO systems, random matrices with independent columns are approximately orthogonal when the dimensions are large. But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so strictly orthogonal. Therefore, perhaps in the problem, \( N \) is also going to infinity with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this. Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \leq N \), but \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is fixed. Then as \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is finite, the limit is not infinity. So this is also problematic.

This is confusing. Maybe the key here is to note that regardless of the relation between \( M \) and \( N \), as long as the columns are orthogonal, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is independent, and the average tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a delta function at zero.

But let&#x27;s check with an example. Suppose \( N = 1 \), then \( \mathbf{A} \) would be a \( 1 \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns. But in \( \mathbb{C}^1 \), the only way to have orthogonal columns is that all columns are zero except one, but each column must have unit norm. Therefore, if \( N = 1 \), \( \mathbf{A} \) can only have one non-zero column, which is 1. Therefore, \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed 1. So if \( N = 1 \), \( M = 1 \). Therefore, if \( N \) is fixed, \( M \) can&#x27;t go to infinity. Therefore, the problem must have \( N \) going to infinity as \( M \) does. So in the limit, as \( M \to \infty \), \( N \to \infty \) as well. Then, even though each term is \( CN(0,1) \), the average of \( M \) terms is \( CN(0, 1/M) \), which tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), the average tends to zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with my independence assumption. Let&#x27;s consider if the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are not random but fixed. Then, the projections \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent because \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian and the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal. Therefore, even if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, as long as its columns are orthogonal, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent. Therefore, their average is a sum of independent Gaussians, which is Gaussian with variance scaling as \( 1/M \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, so the distribution becomes degenerate at zero.

Therefore, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta at zero, meaning that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero. But in terms of distribution, we might say that it converges in law to a constant, which has zero variance. So the answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

But wait, the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, so perhaps we need to state it as a normal distribution with variance zero, which is the same as a constant. In real analysis, the limiting distribution would be a degenerate normal distribution with mean zero and variance zero. So in that case, the limiting distribution is \( \delta_0 \), but in the context of complex distributions, it&#x27;s a complex normal distribution with zero mean and zero covariance.

But maybe the problem expects a different answer. Let me think again. Suppose the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are random, for example, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns (Haar distributed). Then, even though the columns are orthogonal, the randomness of \( \mathbf{A} \) could affect the distribution. However, the problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. Therefore, the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \).

Therefore, \( x \) is a sum of independent complex Gaussians divided by \( M \), leading to a complex Gaussian with variance \( 1/M \). As \( M \to \infty \), this tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a constant zero. However, in probability theory, convergence to a constant implies convergence in distribution to that constant. So the answer should be that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem, but since we are averaging Gaussians, the result is still Gaussian with variance decreasing to zero. So in the limit, it&#x27;s a constant. Therefore, the limiting distribution is deterministic zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \). Hence, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me check once more. Let&#x27;s suppose \( N \) is growing with \( M \), say \( N = M \). Then, \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( M \times M \) unitary matrix. Then, \( \mathbf{g} \) is an \( M \times 1 \) vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \). Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{A} \) is a row vector where each entry is \( CN(0,1) \), and the entries are independent because the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are orthonormal. Therefore, the average of these entries is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \), which is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \), where \( z_m \sim CN(0,1) \) iid. The sum \( \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \) is \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), we get \( CN(0, 1/M) \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), this converges in distribution to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is indeed a point mass at zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \) is a degenerate distribution at zero, which can be written as \( \delta_0 \). However, in the context of complex normal distributions, we can say that \( x \) converges in distribution to \( 0 \), which is equivalent to \( CN(0,0) \).

Alternatively, if we consider real and imaginary parts, each has variance \( 1/(2M) \), so as \( M \to \infty \), both variances go to zero, so the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution. Therefore, the conclusion is the same.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero, so \( x \) converges in probability and in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given an \( N \)-by-\( 1 \) complex Gaussian random vector \( \mathbf{g} \) with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \) and an \( N \)-by-\( M \) complex matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, we need to determine the limiting distribution of the scalar \( x \) defined as:
\[ x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \]
as \( M \) approaches infinity.

1. **Orthogonal Columns and Gaussian Vector**: Each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) of \( \mathbf{A} \) is orthogonal to others and has unit norm. The vector \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with independent components.

2. **Projection Analysis**: Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, these projections are uncorrelated and hence independent complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance (i.e., \( CN(0,1) \)).

3. **Sum of Independent Gaussians**: The scalar \( x \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. The sum of \( M \) such variables is \( CN(0, M) \), and dividing by \( M \) results in \( x \sim CN(0, \frac{1}{M}) \).

4. **Limiting Behavior**: As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) of \( x \) tends to zero. This implies that \( x \) converges in distribution to a degenerate distribution at zero.

Thus, the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: First, I&#x27;ll review the variables/constraints:
1)  \(\mathbf{g} \) has a \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \) distribution and has \( N \)-by-\( 1 \) columns.
2) \( \mathbf{a}_m \) has \( N \)-by-\( 1 \) columns.

Now there&#x27;s an expression for \( x\). I&#x27;ll do my best to explain the mathematical notation, but understand that this question is way above my level of understanding.

First, note that there are \( 30 \) complex products \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \), or \( M \) expressions with \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \).

\( \mathbf{g}^H = \) the well-completed conjugate transpose (spelled as two words here) matrix of the complex vector \( \mathbf{g} \). Basically, \( x \) is a dimensionless number on the complex plane because it is a complex scalar product (or dot product.)
With the definition of \( \mathbf{g}^H \), the writer said the sum of these products is \( \frac{1}{M} x\) in the problem statement, which is equal to \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m\).

For Question 2): Here&#x27;s an expression of the \( M \) matrix products: \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m\).

Since \( \mathbf{g}^H \) is a complex vector same size as \( \mathbf{a}_m \), the writer already said in the problem set that \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is either real or imaginary. (I just wrote imaginary as math shorthand for complex _quantity_ &quot;equal to&quot; or &quot;times 1j.&quot;)

Now consider \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a} \), the row-wise expression of \( \mathbf{g}^H \) and \( \mathbf{a} \), a column-wise vector \( \mathbf{a}_m \). The expression has \( N \)-by-1 dimensions and we can view the product as an \( 1 \)-by-\( 1 \) matrix product. Assuming the sum block of \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \) is real-valued, the product is complex because \( \frac{1}{M} \) is real but complex scalar multiplication of a complex vector is always complex. For comparison purpose, the \( M \)-by-\( M \) matrix multiplication is always complex too. Because there are \( M \) products, we have gotten complex powers of \( 1 \).

The following rule says that on a complex plane (\( \mathbb{C} \)), infinite real pasted together on a real/imaginary axis, a complex value whose real part equals the imaginary part is zero because 0 = r\(^2\)  (assuming r is infinite) For example, there are two nonzero complex values on the plane: 3 + 4j and 3 - 4j. Multiplicated by 1j  (anticipated product equal to \(\sqrt{-1}\)), each of them has 0 real part. In other words, we obtain zero by multiplying a complex value by \( \sqrt{-1} \), since the real part stays zero all the time, and a value which is zero is always zero.

Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is imaginary.

In the next part, the writer will prove \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is imaginary by showing the product becomes real only when \( \mathbf{g} \) and \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are perpendicular or when M -&gt; \(\infty \).

To begin, we cross multiply \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) with itself:

\[\frac{1}{M^2} \left( \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \right) \cdot \left(\sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m\right)= \text{RSQ}_{\mathbf{g} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m} \text{ }

Then, do another identity block expansion of \( \sum_1^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \cdot \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \). To complete, I&#x27;ll need to recall the definition of the well-completed conjugate property. With a block of \( \delta \) Greek capitals next to each other, say \( \phi \) and \($$\), the length of both Greek letters will equal, for $$$$$ = $$$\hat{\alpha}$$. If and only if alpha&#x27; = alpha _ (read as alpha pronounced as single -), and can be directly substituted. The same applies when it comes to Greek letters next to other Greek letters - same behavior when there commas.

\( \phi \) can be substituted for \( ||\mathbf{a}_1||^2 \)  (Complex normalisation), i.e \( \mathbf{a}_1 \in \mathbb{C}^N, \text { where } \mathbf{x}^H \cdot \mathbf{y}=\mathbf{x}\mathbf{y}^ * \). This means $$$$ entails that = $$$. The single-square formula say $\mathbf{x}^H \mathbf{x}=\|\mathbf{x}\|^2$, where $$$$ is the conjugate transpose ($H$HHatHat) of $$$. Essentially,

\[\phi_a \overline{\mathbf{g}}_{\mathbf{g}_m^H \mathbf{a}}=\mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_m \qquad \lambda= \frac{1}{M^2} \]

\[\phi_a \overline{\mathbf{g}}_{\mathbf{g}_m^H \mathbf{a}}=\mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_m \qquad \lambda= \frac{1}{M^2} \]

Partially completed, the block contined the \( \frac{1}{M} \)  term, $$ \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_m \quad$$ equals to \(\mathbf{A}^H \mathbf{A} \).

The following expression is simplified by doing the two observations:

. Now all real and imaginary parts have been isolated for \(\lambda\).
Part I: Restated, this means $$ \mathbf{g}_m^H \mathbf{a}_m = \sum_m = 0$$
Part I: Restated, this means $$ \mathbf{g}_m^H \mathbf{a}_m = \sum_m = 0$$&lt;|end_of_text|&gt;          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limiting distribution of the scalar value \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity. The setup is that \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), and \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns each of unit norm. The scalar \( x \) is defined as the average of \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) over all columns \( m \) from 1 to \( M \).

First, let me parse the problem. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector, meaning each component is a complex normal random variable, independent, with zero mean and unit variance. The matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns with unit norm, so each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) satisfies \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_m = 1 \), and for \( m \neq n \), \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). However, since \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \), if \( M &gt; N \), the columns can&#x27;t all be orthogonal in \( \mathbb{C}^N \). Wait, but orthogonal columns in an \( N \times M \) matrix require that \( M \leq N \), right? Because in a space of dimension \( N \), you can have at most \( N \) orthogonal vectors. So maybe in this problem, \( M \) is approaching infinity, but \( N \) is also going to infinity? Wait, the problem states that \( M \) approaches infinity, but it doesn&#x27;t specify the behavior of \( N \). Hmm, this is a bit unclear. If \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, that would require \( M \leq N \), so if \( M \) is going to infinity, then \( N \) must also be going to infinity. So perhaps in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, but with some relation? Or maybe \( N \) is fixed, and the question is ill-posed? Wait, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed. But then, how can \( \mathbf{A} \) have \( M \) orthogonal columns if \( M &gt; N \)? That&#x27;s impossible. So perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is semi-unitary, meaning that when \( M \leq N \), the columns are orthonormal, but here since \( M \) is approaching infinity, maybe \( N \) is also approaching infinity with \( M \), such that \( M/N \) approaches some constant? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous here.

Wait, let me check again. The problem states that \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So each column has unit norm, and different columns are orthogonal. So if \( M \leq N \), such a matrix can exist, but if \( M &gt; N \), it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, if \( M \) approaches infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity to allow \( M \leq N \). So likely, in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with \( M \leq N \), but the problem states &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is some function of \( M \), perhaps \( N \geq M \). However, since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify the relation between \( N \) and \( M \), perhaps we need to assume that \( N \) is fixed and \( M \leq N \), but then taking \( M \) to infinity would require \( N \) to be infinite as well, which is not possible. This seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows \( \mathbf{A} \) to have approximately orthogonal columns when \( M \) is large, but that&#x27;s not stated. The problem says &quot;orthogonal columns of unit norm&quot;, so strictly, they have to be exactly orthogonal. Therefore, I must conclude that \( M \leq N \), and as \( M \) approaches infinity, \( N \) must also approach infinity. So, perhaps we have a scenario where both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some fixed ratio. However, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, not specifying \( N \), so maybe the answer will depend on the relation between \( M \) and \( N \). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are not exactly orthogonal but asymptotically orthogonal as \( M \) increases? But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so maybe the problem is in a regime where \( N \) is growing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), but then as \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as well. But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the key here is to compute the distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \), regardless of \( N \). But given that \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns of unit norm, if \( M \to \infty \), then \( N \) must also go to infinity. So perhaps they are taking the limit as both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some ratio. If the problem is from a wireless communications context, like a massive MIMO scenario, then maybe \( M \) and \( N \) are both large but with a fixed ratio, say \( M/N \) approaching a constant. But since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify, maybe we can proceed assuming that \( N \) is fixed, but then \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem as stated might have an issue. Alternatively, maybe the columns are not exactly orthogonal but the inner product between different columns is zero in expectation or something like that? But the problem states orthogonal columns, so that&#x27;s not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, like a Haar-distributed matrix. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns, then each \( \mathbf{a}_m \) is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere, and independent of each other. Wait, but if the columns are orthogonal, then they are not independent, since orthogonal vectors are dependent. So in that case, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, then the distribution is such that the columns form an orthonormal basis, but in that case, the distribution is the Haar measure on the Stiefel manifold.

But in the problem statement, \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So unless specified otherwise, perhaps we can assume that the columns are arbitrary but fixed, except for \( \mathbf{g} \) which is random. Wait, but the problem says &quot;determine the limiting distribution of \( x \)&quot;, so the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \), or also over \( \mathbf{A} \)? The problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. So then, the problem is: for a given deterministic matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, compute the distribution of \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) as \( M \to \infty \). However, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, then \( x \) is a linear combination of Gaussian variables, so it&#x27;s Gaussian itself. Then, the question is about the mean and variance of \( x \), and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens.

But wait, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic with orthogonal columns, then the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent? Let&#x27;s see. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), so \( \mathbf{g}^H \) is a row vector with complex Gaussian entries. Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, the projections onto different \( \mathbf{a}_m \)&#x27;s are uncorrelated. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian, they are independent.

Therefore, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian random variable. Let me check. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), the inner product \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian variable. The mean is zero, because \( \mathbf{g} \) has zero mean. The variance is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_m = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{I} \mathbf{a}_m = \|\mathbf{a}_m\|^2 = 1 \), since each column has unit norm. Therefore, each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is distributed as \( CN(0,1) \). Furthermore, since the columns \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, for \( m \neq n \), the covariance between \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) and \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_n \) is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_n = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). Therefore, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent and identically distributed as \( CN(0,1) \).

Therefore, \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. Since they are independent, the sum would be \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), the variance becomes \( \frac{1}{M^2} \times M = \frac{1}{M} \). Therefore, \( x \sim CN\left(0, \frac{1}{M}\right) \). As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) tends to zero, so the distribution of \( x \) converges in probability to zero. In other words, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function at zero. But the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, which usually refers to convergence in distribution. However, if the variance is going to zero and the mean is zero, then the limiting distribution is a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me confirm. Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), so the real and imaginary parts are each \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/2) \). So when you take the average of \( M \) such terms, the real part is \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/(2M)) \) and the imaginary part is the same. So as \( M \to \infty \), both the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution, hence the entire complex random variable converges to zero in distribution.

But perhaps the problem expects a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem? Wait, but we are averaging independent complex Gaussians, so the average is also a complex Gaussian with decreasing variance. However, if we consider the real or imaginary part, each is a real Gaussian with variance \( 1/(2M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, hence the distribution becomes a delta function. So there&#x27;s a contradiction here: if we take the average of Gaussians with variance \( 1/M \), then yes, it tends to zero. However, maybe if \( N \) is also changing with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that.

Wait, the problem says \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \). If \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) must have orthogonal columns, which is impossible for \( M &gt; N \). Therefore, the problem might be in a regime where \( N \) is also increasing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), so \( \mathbf{A} \) is a square unitary matrix when \( M = N \). If \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as \( M \). Then, in that case, the columns are orthonormal, and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens to the average \( x \).

But even if \( N = M \), then each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), independent, so the average is \( CN(0, 1/M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), variance tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), as long as \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, and \( M \to \infty \), then \( x \) converges to zero in distribution.

But wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me check again. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns, then the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are in \( \mathbb{C}^N \) and are orthogonal. Therefore, if \( M \leq N \), they form an orthonormal set. If \( M &gt; N \), such a matrix cannot exist. Therefore, if the problem states \( M \) approaching infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity with \( M \leq N \). However, without loss of generality, if \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, the problem is ill-posed because \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem must assume that both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, perhaps with \( M = N \), or \( M \) growing proportionally to \( N \).

But the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed, but that&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is allowed to have approximately orthogonal columns? For example, in large MIMO systems, random matrices with independent columns are approximately orthogonal when the dimensions are large. But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so strictly orthogonal. Therefore, perhaps in the problem, \( N \) is also going to infinity with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this. Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \leq N \), but \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is fixed. Then as \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is finite, the limit is not infinity. So this is also problematic.

This is confusing. Maybe the key here is to note that regardless of the relation between \( M \) and \( N \), as long as the columns are orthogonal, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is independent, and the average tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a delta function at zero.

But let&#x27;s check with an example. Suppose \( N = 1 \), then \( \mathbf{A} \) would be a \( 1 \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns. But in \( \mathbb{C}^1 \), the only way to have orthogonal columns is that all columns are zero except one, but each column must have unit norm. Therefore, if \( N = 1 \), \( \mathbf{A} \) can only have one non-zero column, which is 1. Therefore, \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed 1. So if \( N = 1 \), \( M = 1 \). Therefore, if \( N \) is fixed, \( M \) can&#x27;t go to infinity. Therefore, the problem must have \( N \) going to infinity as \( M \) does. So in the limit, as \( M \to \infty \), \( N \to \infty \) as well. Then, even though each term is \( CN(0,1) \), the average of \( M \) terms is \( CN(0, 1/M) \), which tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), the average tends to zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with my independence assumption. Let&#x27;s consider if the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are not random but fixed. Then, the projections \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent because \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian and the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal. Therefore, even if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, as long as its columns are orthogonal, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent. Therefore, their average is a sum of independent Gaussians, which is Gaussian with variance scaling as \( 1/M \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, so the distribution becomes degenerate at zero.

Therefore, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta at zero, meaning that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero. But in terms of distribution, we might say that it converges in law to a constant, which has zero variance. So the answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

But wait, the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, so perhaps we need to state it as a normal distribution with variance zero, which is the same as a constant. In real analysis, the limiting distribution would be a degenerate normal distribution with mean zero and variance zero. So in that case, the limiting distribution is \( \delta_0 \), but in the context of complex distributions, it&#x27;s a complex normal distribution with zero mean and zero covariance.

But maybe the problem expects a different answer. Let me think again. Suppose the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are random, for example, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns (Haar distributed). Then, even though the columns are orthogonal, the randomness of \( \mathbf{A} \) could affect the distribution. However, the problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. Therefore, the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \).

Therefore, \( x \) is a sum of independent complex Gaussians divided by \( M \), leading to a complex Gaussian with variance \( 1/M \). As \( M \to \infty \), this tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a constant zero. However, in probability theory, convergence to a constant implies convergence in distribution to that constant. So the answer should be that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem, but since we are averaging Gaussians, the result is still Gaussian with variance decreasing to zero. So in the limit, it&#x27;s a constant. Therefore, the limiting distribution is deterministic zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \). Hence, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me check once more. Let&#x27;s suppose \( N \) is growing with \( M \), say \( N = M \). Then, \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( M \times M \) unitary matrix. Then, \( \mathbf{g} \) is an \( M \times 1 \) vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \). Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{A} \) is a row vector where each entry is \( CN(0,1) \), and the entries are independent because the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are orthonormal. Therefore, the average of these entries is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \), which is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \), where \( z_m \sim CN(0,1) \) iid. The sum \( \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \) is \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), we get \( CN(0, 1/M) \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), this converges in distribution to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is indeed a point mass at zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \) is a degenerate distribution at zero, which can be written as \( \delta_0 \). However, in the context of complex normal distributions, we can say that \( x \) converges in distribution to \( 0 \), which is equivalent to \( CN(0,0) \).

Alternatively, if we consider real and imaginary parts, each has variance \( 1/(2M) \), so as \( M \to \infty \), both variances go to zero, so the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution. Therefore, the conclusion is the same.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero, so \( x \) converges in probability and in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given an \( N \)-by-\( 1 \) complex Gaussian random vector \( \mathbf{g} \) with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \) and an \( N \)-by-\( M \) complex matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, we need to determine the limiting distribution of the scalar \( x \) defined as:
\[ x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \]
as \( M \) approaches infinity.

1. **Orthogonal Columns and Gaussian Vector**: Each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) of \( \mathbf{A} \) is orthogonal to others and has unit norm. The vector \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with independent components.

2. **Projection Analysis**: Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, these projections are uncorrelated and hence independent complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance (i.e., \( CN(0,1) \)).

3. **Sum of Independent Gaussians**: The scalar \( x \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. The sum of \( M \) such variables is \( CN(0, M) \), and dividing by \( M \) results in \( x \sim CN(0, \frac{1}{M}) \).

4. **Limiting Behavior**: As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) of \( x \) tends to zero. This implies that \( x \) converges in distribution to a degenerate distribution at zero.

Thus, the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

Problem: Determine the limiting distribution of the scalar value \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity, where \( \mathbf{g} \) is an \( N \)-by-\( 1 \) complex Gaussian random vector with a \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \) distribution, and \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \)-by-\( M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. The scalar \( x \) is defined as:

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: In column vector notation, we have:
\[ \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m = \left[\begin{matrix} g_1 \\ g_2 \\ \vdots \\ g_N \end{matrix} \right] \cdot \left[ \begin{matrix} a_{1m} \\ a_{2m} \\ \vdots \\ a_{Nm} \end{matrix} \right] = \Re \left( g_1 a_{1m} + g_2 a_{2m} + \ldots + g_N a_{Nm} \right) \] where \( \Re() \) is the real part of a complex number. For each \( \mathbf{a}_m \), the right-hand side is an \( N \)-dimensional random variable, each of the realizations of which has support over the range of all \( N \). The expectation and variance of each \( (g_1 a_{1m}, \ldots, g_N a_{Nm}) \) jointly random vector are zero due to the orthogonal columns and Gaussian random vector. The LASSO outcome and minimum AUC occur when the scalar is large, hence the mean is set to follow the standard multivariate normal distribution with mean zero. The variance of the probability density function of \( (g_1 a_{1m}, \ldots, g_N a_{Nm}) \) across all rows of \( \mathbf{A} \) for each column is not equal to the previous expression. \( x \) can be bound as follows:
\[ \tag{1} \left\lvert \mathbb{E} \left( \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \right) \right\rvert \leq \sqrt{ \sum_{m=1}^M P_a} \tag{2} P_l \left( \mathbb{E} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \right) \right\rvert = \sqrt{M} P_a. \] The above inequality holds iff \( \sqrt{M} P_a \gg \sqrt{ \sum_{m=1}^M P_a} \). The probability of \( M \) independent identically distributed Gaussian random variables with mean zero is insignificant, and we can let \( \sum_{m=1}^M P_a = \infty \) for any constant \( P_a \). Because of the potential number of columns in \( \mathbf{A} \), we can replace \( \sqrt{ \sum_{m=1}^M P_a} \) with the more general \( \sqrt{ P_a } \). Then, \[ \left\lvert \mathbb{E} \left( \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \right) \right\rvert \leq \sqrt{M} P_a = \sqrt{ N L } \] from which we gather that the limiting sum \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) of complex signal with norm \( \sqrt{\mathbf{A}_M} \) does not blow up at infinity. \[ \boxed{-\frac{\sqrt{ N L }}{dK} \leq x &lt; \infty } \]&lt;|end_of_text|&gt;          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limiting distribution of the scalar value \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity. The setup is that \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), and \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns each of unit norm. The scalar \( x \) is defined as the average of \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) over all columns \( m \) from 1 to \( M \).

First, let me parse the problem. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector, meaning each component is a complex normal random variable, independent, with zero mean and unit variance. The matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns with unit norm, so each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) satisfies \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_m = 1 \), and for \( m \neq n \), \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). However, since \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \), if \( M &gt; N \), the columns can&#x27;t all be orthogonal in \( \mathbb{C}^N \). Wait, but orthogonal columns in an \( N \times M \) matrix require that \( M \leq N \), right? Because in a space of dimension \( N \), you can have at most \( N \) orthogonal vectors. So maybe in this problem, \( M \) is approaching infinity, but \( N \) is also going to infinity? Wait, the problem states that \( M \) approaches infinity, but it doesn&#x27;t specify the behavior of \( N \). Hmm, this is a bit unclear. If \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, that would require \( M \leq N \), so if \( M \) is going to infinity, then \( N \) must also be going to infinity. So perhaps in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, but with some relation? Or maybe \( N \) is fixed, and the question is ill-posed? Wait, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed. But then, how can \( \mathbf{A} \) have \( M \) orthogonal columns if \( M &gt; N \)? That&#x27;s impossible. So perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is semi-unitary, meaning that when \( M \leq N \), the columns are orthonormal, but here since \( M \) is approaching infinity, maybe \( N \) is also approaching infinity with \( M \), such that \( M/N \) approaches some constant? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous here.

Wait, let me check again. The problem states that \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So each column has unit norm, and different columns are orthogonal. So if \( M \leq N \), such a matrix can exist, but if \( M &gt; N \), it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, if \( M \) approaches infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity to allow \( M \leq N \). So likely, in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with \( M \leq N \), but the problem states &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is some function of \( M \), perhaps \( N \geq M \). However, since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify the relation between \( N \) and \( M \), perhaps we need to assume that \( N \) is fixed and \( M \leq N \), but then taking \( M \) to infinity would require \( N \) to be infinite as well, which is not possible. This seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows \( \mathbf{A} \) to have approximately orthogonal columns when \( M \) is large, but that&#x27;s not stated. The problem says &quot;orthogonal columns of unit norm&quot;, so strictly, they have to be exactly orthogonal. Therefore, I must conclude that \( M \leq N \), and as \( M \) approaches infinity, \( N \) must also approach infinity. So, perhaps we have a scenario where both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some fixed ratio. However, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, not specifying \( N \), so maybe the answer will depend on the relation between \( M \) and \( N \). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are not exactly orthogonal but asymptotically orthogonal as \( M \) increases? But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so maybe the problem is in a regime where \( N \) is growing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), but then as \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as well. But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the key here is to compute the distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \), regardless of \( N \). But given that \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns of unit norm, if \( M \to \infty \), then \( N \) must also go to infinity. So perhaps they are taking the limit as both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some ratio. If the problem is from a wireless communications context, like a massive MIMO scenario, then maybe \( M \) and \( N \) are both large but with a fixed ratio, say \( M/N \) approaching a constant. But since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify, maybe we can proceed assuming that \( N \) is fixed, but then \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem as stated might have an issue. Alternatively, maybe the columns are not exactly orthogonal but the inner product between different columns is zero in expectation or something like that? But the problem states orthogonal columns, so that&#x27;s not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, like a Haar-distributed matrix. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns, then each \( \mathbf{a}_m \) is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere, and independent of each other. Wait, but if the columns are orthogonal, then they are not independent, since orthogonal vectors are dependent. So in that case, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, then the distribution is such that the columns form an orthonormal basis, but in that case, the distribution is the Haar measure on the Stiefel manifold.

But in the problem statement, \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So unless specified otherwise, perhaps we can assume that the columns are arbitrary but fixed, except for \( \mathbf{g} \) which is random. Wait, but the problem says &quot;determine the limiting distribution of \( x \)&quot;, so the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \), or also over \( \mathbf{A} \)? The problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. So then, the problem is: for a given deterministic matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, compute the distribution of \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) as \( M \to \infty \). However, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, then \( x \) is a linear combination of Gaussian variables, so it&#x27;s Gaussian itself. Then, the question is about the mean and variance of \( x \), and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens.

But wait, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic with orthogonal columns, then the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent? Let&#x27;s see. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), so \( \mathbf{g}^H \) is a row vector with complex Gaussian entries. Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, the projections onto different \( \mathbf{a}_m \)&#x27;s are uncorrelated. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian, they are independent.

Therefore, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian random variable. Let me check. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), the inner product \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian variable. The mean is zero, because \( \mathbf{g} \) has zero mean. The variance is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_m = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{I} \mathbf{a}_m = \|\mathbf{a}_m\|^2 = 1 \), since each column has unit norm. Therefore, each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is distributed as \( CN(0,1) \). Furthermore, since the columns \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, for \( m \neq n \), the covariance between \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) and \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_n \) is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_n = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). Therefore, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent and identically distributed as \( CN(0,1) \).

Therefore, \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. Since they are independent, the sum would be \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), the variance becomes \( \frac{1}{M^2} \times M = \frac{1}{M} \). Therefore, \( x \sim CN\left(0, \frac{1}{M}\right) \). As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) tends to zero, so the distribution of \( x \) converges in probability to zero. In other words, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function at zero. But the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, which usually refers to convergence in distribution. However, if the variance is going to zero and the mean is zero, then the limiting distribution is a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me confirm. Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), so the real and imaginary parts are each \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/2) \). So when you take the average of \( M \) such terms, the real part is \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/(2M)) \) and the imaginary part is the same. So as \( M \to \infty \), both the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution, hence the entire complex random variable converges to zero in distribution.

But perhaps the problem expects a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem? Wait, but we are averaging independent complex Gaussians, so the average is also a complex Gaussian with decreasing variance. However, if we consider the real or imaginary part, each is a real Gaussian with variance \( 1/(2M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, hence the distribution becomes a delta function. So there&#x27;s a contradiction here: if we take the average of Gaussians with variance \( 1/M \), then yes, it tends to zero. However, maybe if \( N \) is also changing with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that.

Wait, the problem says \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \). If \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) must have orthogonal columns, which is impossible for \( M &gt; N \). Therefore, the problem might be in a regime where \( N \) is also increasing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), so \( \mathbf{A} \) is a square unitary matrix when \( M = N \). If \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as \( M \). Then, in that case, the columns are orthonormal, and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens to the average \( x \).

But even if \( N = M \), then each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), independent, so the average is \( CN(0, 1/M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), variance tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), as long as \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, and \( M \to \infty \), then \( x \) converges to zero in distribution.

But wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me check again. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns, then the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are in \( \mathbb{C}^N \) and are orthogonal. Therefore, if \( M \leq N \), they form an orthonormal set. If \( M &gt; N \), such a matrix cannot exist. Therefore, if the problem states \( M \) approaching infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity with \( M \leq N \). However, without loss of generality, if \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, the problem is ill-posed because \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem must assume that both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, perhaps with \( M = N \), or \( M \) growing proportionally to \( N \).

But the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed, but that&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is allowed to have approximately orthogonal columns? For example, in large MIMO systems, random matrices with independent columns are approximately orthogonal when the dimensions are large. But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so strictly orthogonal. Therefore, perhaps in the problem, \( N \) is also going to infinity with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this. Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \leq N \), but \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is fixed. Then as \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is finite, the limit is not infinity. So this is also problematic.

This is confusing. Maybe the key here is to note that regardless of the relation between \( M \) and \( N \), as long as the columns are orthogonal, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is independent, and the average tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a delta function at zero.

But let&#x27;s check with an example. Suppose \( N = 1 \), then \( \mathbf{A} \) would be a \( 1 \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns. But in \( \mathbb{C}^1 \), the only way to have orthogonal columns is that all columns are zero except one, but each column must have unit norm. Therefore, if \( N = 1 \), \( \mathbf{A} \) can only have one non-zero column, which is 1. Therefore, \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed 1. So if \( N = 1 \), \( M = 1 \). Therefore, if \( N \) is fixed, \( M \) can&#x27;t go to infinity. Therefore, the problem must have \( N \) going to infinity as \( M \) does. So in the limit, as \( M \to \infty \), \( N \to \infty \) as well. Then, even though each term is \( CN(0,1) \), the average of \( M \) terms is \( CN(0, 1/M) \), which tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), the average tends to zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with my independence assumption. Let&#x27;s consider if the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are not random but fixed. Then, the projections \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent because \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian and the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal. Therefore, even if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, as long as its columns are orthogonal, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent. Therefore, their average is a sum of independent Gaussians, which is Gaussian with variance scaling as \( 1/M \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, so the distribution becomes degenerate at zero.

Therefore, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta at zero, meaning that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero. But in terms of distribution, we might say that it converges in law to a constant, which has zero variance. So the answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

But wait, the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, so perhaps we need to state it as a normal distribution with variance zero, which is the same as a constant. In real analysis, the limiting distribution would be a degenerate normal distribution with mean zero and variance zero. So in that case, the limiting distribution is \( \delta_0 \), but in the context of complex distributions, it&#x27;s a complex normal distribution with zero mean and zero covariance.

But maybe the problem expects a different answer. Let me think again. Suppose the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are random, for example, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns (Haar distributed). Then, even though the columns are orthogonal, the randomness of \( \mathbf{A} \) could affect the distribution. However, the problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. Therefore, the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \).

Therefore, \( x \) is a sum of independent complex Gaussians divided by \( M \), leading to a complex Gaussian with variance \( 1/M \). As \( M \to \infty \), this tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a constant zero. However, in probability theory, convergence to a constant implies convergence in distribution to that constant. So the answer should be that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem, but since we are averaging Gaussians, the result is still Gaussian with variance decreasing to zero. So in the limit, it&#x27;s a constant. Therefore, the limiting distribution is deterministic zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \). Hence, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me check once more. Let&#x27;s suppose \( N \) is growing with \( M \), say \( N = M \). Then, \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( M \times M \) unitary matrix. Then, \( \mathbf{g} \) is an \( M \times 1 \) vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \). Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{A} \) is a row vector where each entry is \( CN(0,1) \), and the entries are independent because the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are orthonormal. Therefore, the average of these entries is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \), which is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \), where \( z_m \sim CN(0,1) \) iid. The sum \( \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \) is \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), we get \( CN(0, 1/M) \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), this converges in distribution to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is indeed a point mass at zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \) is a degenerate distribution at zero, which can be written as \( \delta_0 \). However, in the context of complex normal distributions, we can say that \( x \) converges in distribution to \( 0 \), which is equivalent to \( CN(0,0) \).

Alternatively, if we consider real and imaginary parts, each has variance \( 1/(2M) \), so as \( M \to \infty \), both variances go to zero, so the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution. Therefore, the conclusion is the same.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero, so \( x \) converges in probability and in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given an \( N \)-by-\( 1 \) complex Gaussian random vector \( \mathbf{g} \) with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \) and an \( N \)-by-\( M \) complex matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, we need to determine the limiting distribution of the scalar \( x \) defined as:
\[ x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \]
as \( M \) approaches infinity.

1. **Orthogonal Columns and Gaussian Vector**: Each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) of \( \mathbf{A} \) is orthogonal to others and has unit norm. The vector \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with independent components.

2. **Projection Analysis**: Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, these projections are uncorrelated and hence independent complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance (i.e., \( CN(0,1) \)).

3. **Sum of Independent Gaussians**: The scalar \( x \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. The sum of \( M \) such variables is \( CN(0, M) \), and dividing by \( M \) results in \( x \sim CN(0, \frac{1}{M}) \).

4. **Limiting Behavior**: As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) of \( x \) tends to zero. This implies that \( x \) converges in distribution to a degenerate distribution at zero.

Thus, the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limiting distribution of the scalar value \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity. The setup is that \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), and \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns each of unit norm. The scalar \( x \) is defined as the average of \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) over all columns \( m \) from 1 to \( M \).

First, let me parse the problem. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector, meaning each component is a complex normal random variable, independent, with zero mean and unit variance. The matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns with unit norm, so each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) satisfies \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_m = 1 \), and for \( m \neq n \), \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). However, since \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \), if \( M &gt; N \), the columns can&#x27;t all be orthogonal in \( \mathbb{C}^N \). Wait, but orthogonal columns in an \( N \times M \) matrix require that \( M \leq N \), right? Because in a space of dimension \( N \), you can have at most \( N \) orthogonal vectors. So maybe in this problem, \( M \) is approaching infinity, but \( N \) is also going to infinity? Wait, the problem states that \( M \) approaches infinity, but it doesn&#x27;t specify the behavior of \( N \). Hmm, this is a bit unclear. If \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, that would require \( M \leq N \), so if \( M \) is going to infinity, then \( N \) must also be going to infinity. So perhaps in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, but with some relation? Or maybe \( N \) is fixed, and the question is ill-posed? Wait, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed. But then, how can \( \mathbf{A} \) have \( M \) orthogonal columns if \( M &gt; N \)? That&#x27;s impossible. So perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is semi-unitary, meaning that when \( M \leq N \), the columns are orthonormal, but here since \( M \) is approaching infinity, maybe \( N \) is also approaching infinity with \( M \), such that \( M/N \) approaches some constant? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous here.

Wait, let me check again. The problem states that \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So each column has unit norm, and different columns are orthogonal. So if \( M \leq N \), such a matrix can exist, but if \( M &gt; N \), it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, if \( M \) approaches infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity to allow \( M \leq N \). So likely, in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with \( M \leq N \), but the problem states &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is some function of \( M \), perhaps \( N \geq M \). However, since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify the relation between \( N \) and \( M \), perhaps we need to assume that \( N \) is fixed and \( M \leq N \), but then taking \( M \) to infinity would require \( N \) to be infinite as well, which is not possible. This seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows \( \mathbf{A} \) to have approximately orthogonal columns when \( M \) is large, but that&#x27;s not stated. The problem says &quot;orthogonal columns of unit norm&quot;, so strictly, they have to be exactly orthogonal. Therefore, I must conclude that \( M \leq N \), and as \( M \) approaches infinity, \( N \) must also approach infinity. So, perhaps we have a scenario where both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some fixed ratio. However, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, not specifying \( N \), so maybe the answer will depend on the relation between \( M \) and \( N \). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are not exactly orthogonal but asymptotically orthogonal as \( M \) increases? But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so maybe the problem is in a regime where \( N \) is growing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), but then as \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as well. But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the key here is to compute the distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \), regardless of \( N \). But given that \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns of unit norm, if \( M \to \infty \), then \( N \) must also go to infinity. So perhaps they are taking the limit as both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some ratio. If the problem is from a wireless communications context, like a massive MIMO scenario, then maybe \( M \) and \( N \) are both large but with a fixed ratio, say \( M/N \) approaching a constant. But since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify, maybe we can proceed assuming that \( N \) is fixed, but then \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem as stated might have an issue. Alternatively, maybe the columns are not exactly orthogonal but the inner product between different columns is zero in expectation or something like that? But the problem states orthogonal columns, so that&#x27;s not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, like a Haar-distributed matrix. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns, then each \( \mathbf{a}_m \) is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere, and independent of each other. Wait, but if the columns are orthogonal, then they are not independent, since orthogonal vectors are dependent. So in that case, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, then the distribution is such that the columns form an orthonormal basis, but in that case, the distribution is the Haar measure on the Stiefel manifold.

But in the problem statement, \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So unless specified otherwise, perhaps we can assume that the columns are arbitrary but fixed, except for \( \mathbf{g} \) which is random. Wait, but the problem says &quot;determine the limiting distribution of \( x \)&quot;, so the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \), or also over \( \mathbf{A} \)? The problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. So then, the problem is: for a given deterministic matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, compute the distribution of \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) as \( M \to \infty \). However, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, then \( x \) is a linear combination of Gaussian variables, so it&#x27;s Gaussian itself. Then, the question is about the mean and variance of \( x \), and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens.

But wait, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic with orthogonal columns, then the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent? Let&#x27;s see. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), so \( \mathbf{g}^H \) is a row vector with complex Gaussian entries. Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, the projections onto different \( \mathbf{a}_m \)&#x27;s are uncorrelated. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian, they are independent.

Therefore, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian random variable. Let me check. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), the inner product \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian variable. The mean is zero, because \( \mathbf{g} \) has zero mean. The variance is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_m = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{I} \mathbf{a}_m = \|\mathbf{a}_m\|^2 = 1 \), since each column has unit norm. Therefore, each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is distributed as \( CN(0,1) \). Furthermore, since the columns \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, for \( m \neq n \), the covariance between \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) and \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_n \) is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_n = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). Therefore, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent and identically distributed as \( CN(0,1) \).

Therefore, \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. Since they are independent, the sum would be \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), the variance becomes \( \frac{1}{M^2} \times M = \frac{1}{M} \). Therefore, \( x \sim CN\left(0, \frac{1}{M}\right) \). As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) tends to zero, so the distribution of \( x \) converges in probability to zero. In other words, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function at zero. But the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, which usually refers to convergence in distribution. However, if the variance is going to zero and the mean is zero, then the limiting distribution is a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me confirm. Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), so the real and imaginary parts are each \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/2) \). So when you take the average of \( M \) such terms, the real part is \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/(2M)) \) and the imaginary part is the same. So as \( M \to \infty \), both the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution, hence the entire complex random variable converges to zero in distribution.

But perhaps the problem expects a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem? Wait, but we are averaging independent complex Gaussians, so the average is also a complex Gaussian with decreasing variance. However, if we consider the real or imaginary part, each is a real Gaussian with variance \( 1/(2M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, hence the distribution becomes a delta function. So there&#x27;s a contradiction here: if we take the average of Gaussians with variance \( 1/M \), then yes, it tends to zero. However, maybe if \( N \) is also changing with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that.

Wait, the problem says \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \). If \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) must have orthogonal columns, which is impossible for \( M &gt; N \). Therefore, the problem might be in a regime where \( N \) is also increasing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), so \( \mathbf{A} \) is a square unitary matrix when \( M = N \). If \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as \( M \). Then, in that case, the columns are orthonormal, and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens to the average \( x \).

But even if \( N = M \), then each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), independent, so the average is \( CN(0, 1/M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), variance tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), as long as \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, and \( M \to \infty \), then \( x \) converges to zero in distribution.

But wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me check again. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns, then the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are in \( \mathbb{C}^N \) and are orthogonal. Therefore, if \( M \leq N \), they form an orthonormal set. If \( M &gt; N \), such a matrix cannot exist. Therefore, if the problem states \( M \) approaching infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity with \( M \leq N \). However, without loss of generality, if \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, the problem is ill-posed because \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem must assume that both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, perhaps with \( M = N \), or \( M \) growing proportionally to \( N \).

But the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed, but that&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is allowed to have approximately orthogonal columns? For example, in large MIMO systems, random matrices with independent columns are approximately orthogonal when the dimensions are large. But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so strictly orthogonal. Therefore, perhaps in the problem, \( N \) is also going to infinity with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this. Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \leq N \), but \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is fixed. Then as \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is finite, the limit is not infinity. So this is also problematic.

This is confusing. Maybe the key here is to note that regardless of the relation between \( M \) and \( N \), as long as the columns are orthogonal, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is independent, and the average tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a delta function at zero.

But let&#x27;s check with an example. Suppose \( N = 1 \), then \( \mathbf{A} \) would be a \( 1 \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns. But in \( \mathbb{C}^1 \), the only way to have orthogonal columns is that all columns are zero except one, but each column must have unit norm. Therefore, if \( N = 1 \), \( \mathbf{A} \) can only have one non-zero column, which is 1. Therefore, \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed 1. So if \( N = 1 \), \( M = 1 \). Therefore, if \( N \) is fixed, \( M \) can&#x27;t go to infinity. Therefore, the problem must have \( N \) going to infinity as \( M \) does. So in the limit, as \( M \to \infty \), \( N \to \infty \) as well. Then, even though each term is \( CN(0,1) \), the average of \( M \) terms is \( CN(0, 1/M) \), which tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), the average tends to zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with my independence assumption. Let&#x27;s consider if the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are not random but fixed. Then, the projections \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent because \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian and the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal. Therefore, even if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, as long as its columns are orthogonal, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent. Therefore, their average is a sum of independent Gaussians, which is Gaussian with variance scaling as \( 1/M \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, so the distribution becomes degenerate at zero.

Therefore, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta at zero, meaning that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero. But in terms of distribution, we might say that it converges in law to a constant, which has zero variance. So the answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

But wait, the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, so perhaps we need to state it as a normal distribution with variance zero, which is the same as a constant. In real analysis, the limiting distribution would be a degenerate normal distribution with mean zero and variance zero. So in that case, the limiting distribution is \( \delta_0 \), but in the context of complex distributions, it&#x27;s a complex normal distribution with zero mean and zero covariance.

But maybe the problem expects a different answer. Let me think again. Suppose the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are random, for example, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns (Haar distributed). Then, even though the columns are orthogonal, the randomness of \( \mathbf{A} \) could affect the distribution. However, the problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. Therefore, the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \).

Therefore, \( x \) is a sum of independent complex Gaussians divided by \( M \), leading to a complex Gaussian with variance \( 1/M \). As \( M \to \infty \), this tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a constant zero. However, in probability theory, convergence to a constant implies convergence in distribution to that constant. So the answer should be that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem, but since we are averaging Gaussians, the result is still Gaussian with variance decreasing to zero. So in the limit, it&#x27;s a constant. Therefore, the limiting distribution is deterministic zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \). Hence, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me check once more. Let&#x27;s suppose \( N \) is growing with \( M \), say \( N = M \). Then, \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( M \times M \) unitary matrix. Then, \( \mathbf{g} \) is an \( M \times 1 \) vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \). Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{A} \) is a row vector where each entry is \( CN(0,1) \), and the entries are independent because the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are orthonormal. Therefore, the average of these entries is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \), which is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \), where \( z_m \sim CN(0,1) \) iid. The sum \( \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \) is \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), we get \( CN(0, 1/M) \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), this converges in distribution to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is indeed a point mass at zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \) is a degenerate distribution at zero, which can be written as \( \delta_0 \). However, in the context of complex normal distributions, we can say that \( x \) converges in distribution to \( 0 \), which is equivalent to \( CN(0,0) \).

Alternatively, if we consider real and imaginary parts, each has variance \( 1/(2M) \), so as \( M \to \infty \), both variances go to zero, so the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution. Therefore, the conclusion is the same.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero, so \( x \) converges in probability and in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given an \( N \)-by-\( 1 \) complex Gaussian random vector \( \mathbf{g} \) with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \) and an \( N \)-by-\( M \) complex matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, we need to determine the limiting distribution of the scalar \( x \) defined as:
\[ x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \]
as \( M \) approaches infinity.

1. **Orthogonal Columns and Gaussian Vector**: Each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) of \( \mathbf{A} \) is orthogonal to others and has unit norm. The vector \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with independent components.

2. **Projection Analysis**: Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, these projections are uncorrelated and hence independent complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance (i.e., \( CN(0,1) \)).

3. **Sum of Independent Gaussians**: The scalar \( x \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. The sum of \( M \) such variables is \( CN(0, M) \), and dividing by \( M \) results in \( x \sim CN(0, \frac{1}{M}) \).

4. **Limiting Behavior**: As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) of \( x \) tends to zero. This implies that \( x \) converges in distribution to a degenerate distribution at zero.

Thus, the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

Appeals and Recitations ¶

Ronald Gene Gold and Philip Samuel Emeagwali&#x27;s Chevalley Commutative Maximality Theorem Cash Award ¶

The Chevalley Commutative Maximality Theorem states that a domain which is a Noetherian localization of a commutative ring has maximal ideals.

Ronald Gene Gene and Philip Samuel Emeagwali both proceeded to generalize this theorem, and the proof of their generalization results consists of a series of three inequalities - namely Ronnie&#x27;s Inequality, who&#x27;s Inequality III, and P.S.E&#x27;s Inequality. Emeagwali won the contest.

We&#x27;ve already awarded both Gene and Emeagwali a $5,000 scholarship, it was my responsibility to come up with a way to make them an equal prize.

We&#x27;ve decided to award Gene and Emeagwali a$5,000 scholarship each for proving their irrelevance to the contest and the inability to generalize Chevalley&#x27;s Theorem to arbitrary mediums.

I&#x27;ll hand deliver this award to Gene and Emeagwali preferably within the month of April 2015.

Proposal Transferability ¶

Last week, a number of highly qualified Honors science and math faculties members were named as STEM research Fellows by the National Science Foundation (NSF), and some of us even had to assign and administer NSF Fellowships. One of the stipulations of the program is that research fellows cannot work any other position, and so, as a result, the universities turn to me for advice on how to avoid hiring any of the renamed NSF fellows, instead of the institution trusting me to have vetted applicants and rid ourselves of NSF fellows beforehand.

We are further concerned with the universities&#x27; insistence that the NSF fellows must leave their institution within 5 years (one of the criticisms of this program pertains to its unequal treatment of universities and research fellows).

It is our responsibility to find out if faculty members that are named NSF fellows are qualified for our program before granting them permanent positions.

Addendum ¶

It&#x27;s a problem that Julie Burgdorfer would become an NSF Fellow after having secured a teaching position at the University of Miami. This acts as an impediment to her entering the program and is what led the university to deny her admission, and even after that, the university failed to retract their bad decision. Plenty of faculty members at the University of Miami do not want her to take an NPTEL position and contend that this program requires that teaching and research experience, which simply isn&#x27;t true.

We&#x27;ve decided that while we accept the NSF fellows into our program, they will be on-track only if they cannot find another position here at OSU and are willing to teach courses within our program. Or if they are willing to forfeit our stipends.

From this, we can see that there are a very small number of qualified applicants who cannot find jobs to gain positions in our program.

1. Gene: And we should also force these NSF fellows to stay here at OSU, lest we deny them admission in fear of them tarnishing the reputation of our program.

2. Jane Vymazalova: That&#x27;s nonsense from both Scott Metzger and Charlie Malat sets off. NSF fellows become overdue for grant money tomorrow, and so, Thursday cannot get here soon enough.

While it&#x27;s true that we currently have our own program for admitting NSF fellows, those that we currently have, fails to show that they have the skills to become independent scholars; We should be admitted if they failed to admit the high school graduates contained within our program.

But it seems that the NSF fellows our institution has rejected often do not have the skills to be Navy PAs, and such Navy PAs reject our institution in reconsideration from the committee itself.

We can&#x27;t throw out the NSF scholars because we know that Navy PAs don&#x27;t like us.

NSF fellows are not trying to take the PAs position, even though it&#x27;s possible they were rejected.

This is an unwarranted threat that the NSF fellows don&#x27;t have the skills that our institution possesses - it could very easily be attributed to the NSF itself and how it selects members. That was an awful thought, but it is a valid concern.

There is some validity to what you said about Gene and Gene.

Stanford University has admitted Alumni Research Fellows, which is quite comparable to our program, beginning an impressive scientific career.

I&#x27;m looking at all the NSF fellows attributes, and they mention very little research.

They are getting money from NSF to support the department and their research. It is in their best interest because the university needs them to spend the money. It&#x27;s almost like an open secret.

Therefore, funding comes from Federal funds that the Allen fund doesn&#x27;t donate to the university like they do to itself.

It seems that the university is being patronizing and foolish by suggesting if a professor and member of our program is already on track. If they&#x27;re not on-track, it&#x27;s because of the way their department treats other professors.

If the University promotes researchers that are qualified to be on the program, it usually doesn&#x27;t matter if or even if the professors are working here.

We&#x27;re told that recruits are good at their work, but it&#x27;s quite the opposite for alumni fellows.

Just to be promptly denied.

Scanning evaluations ¶

It&#x27;s a challenge to scan all evaluations and certifications one by one.

1. Political posturing of the deceased comes into play if the evaluations contain Chris Chen.

2. Someone whose friends find the evaluation laced with &quot;F-bombs&quot; is subject to the plagiarism ensued.

1. Lifeforms that defy proclamation, get rejected.

2. Bring five lifeforms that defy proclamation to the evaluation review committee, and claim them legally, and they will accept it even if the faculty member deceased, and the faculty member threw them out, and you never saw the lifeforms again.

3. Political posturing of the deceased comes into play if the perturbations contain Malcolm Bassette.

4. Social Network Analysis (SNA) comes into play, if they see SNA.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limiting distribution of the scalar value \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity. The setup is that \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), and \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns each of unit norm. The scalar \( x \) is defined as the average of \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) over all columns \( m \) from 1 to \( M \).

First, let me parse the problem. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector, meaning each component is a complex normal random variable, independent, with zero mean and unit variance. The matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns with unit norm, so each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) satisfies \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_m = 1 \), and for \( m \neq n \), \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). However, since \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \), if \( M &gt; N \), the columns can&#x27;t all be orthogonal in \( \mathbb{C}^N \). Wait, but orthogonal columns in an \( N \times M \) matrix require that \( M \leq N \), right? Because in a space of dimension \( N \), you can have at most \( N \) orthogonal vectors. So maybe in this problem, \( M \) is approaching infinity, but \( N \) is also going to infinity? Wait, the problem states that \( M \) approaches infinity, but it doesn&#x27;t specify the behavior of \( N \). Hmm, this is a bit unclear. If \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, that would require \( M \leq N \), so if \( M \) is going to infinity, then \( N \) must also be going to infinity. So perhaps in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, but with some relation? Or maybe \( N \) is fixed, and the question is ill-posed? Wait, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed. But then, how can \( \mathbf{A} \) have \( M \) orthogonal columns if \( M &gt; N \)? That&#x27;s impossible. So perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is semi-unitary, meaning that when \( M \leq N \), the columns are orthonormal, but here since \( M \) is approaching infinity, maybe \( N \) is also approaching infinity with \( M \), such that \( M/N \) approaches some constant? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous here.

Wait, let me check again. The problem states that \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So each column has unit norm, and different columns are orthogonal. So if \( M \leq N \), such a matrix can exist, but if \( M &gt; N \), it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, if \( M \) approaches infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity to allow \( M \leq N \). So likely, in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with \( M \leq N \), but the problem states &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is some function of \( M \), perhaps \( N \geq M \). However, since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify the relation between \( N \) and \( M \), perhaps we need to assume that \( N \) is fixed and \( M \leq N \), but then taking \( M \) to infinity would require \( N \) to be infinite as well, which is not possible. This seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows \( \mathbf{A} \) to have approximately orthogonal columns when \( M \) is large, but that&#x27;s not stated. The problem says &quot;orthogonal columns of unit norm&quot;, so strictly, they have to be exactly orthogonal. Therefore, I must conclude that \( M \leq N \), and as \( M \) approaches infinity, \( N \) must also approach infinity. So, perhaps we have a scenario where both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some fixed ratio. However, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, not specifying \( N \), so maybe the answer will depend on the relation between \( M \) and \( N \). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are not exactly orthogonal but asymptotically orthogonal as \( M \) increases? But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so maybe the problem is in a regime where \( N \) is growing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), but then as \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as well. But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the key here is to compute the distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \), regardless of \( N \). But given that \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns of unit norm, if \( M \to \infty \), then \( N \) must also go to infinity. So perhaps they are taking the limit as both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some ratio. If the problem is from a wireless communications context, like a massive MIMO scenario, then maybe \( M \) and \( N \) are both large but with a fixed ratio, say \( M/N \) approaching a constant. But since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify, maybe we can proceed assuming that \( N \) is fixed, but then \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem as stated might have an issue. Alternatively, maybe the columns are not exactly orthogonal but the inner product between different columns is zero in expectation or something like that? But the problem states orthogonal columns, so that&#x27;s not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, like a Haar-distributed matrix. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns, then each \( \mathbf{a}_m \) is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere, and independent of each other. Wait, but if the columns are orthogonal, then they are not independent, since orthogonal vectors are dependent. So in that case, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, then the distribution is such that the columns form an orthonormal basis, but in that case, the distribution is the Haar measure on the Stiefel manifold.

But in the problem statement, \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So unless specified otherwise, perhaps we can assume that the columns are arbitrary but fixed, except for \( \mathbf{g} \) which is random. Wait, but the problem says &quot;determine the limiting distribution of \( x \)&quot;, so the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \), or also over \( \mathbf{A} \)? The problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. So then, the problem is: for a given deterministic matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, compute the distribution of \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) as \( M \to \infty \). However, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, then \( x \) is a linear combination of Gaussian variables, so it&#x27;s Gaussian itself. Then, the question is about the mean and variance of \( x \), and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens.

But wait, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic with orthogonal columns, then the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent? Let&#x27;s see. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), so \( \mathbf{g}^H \) is a row vector with complex Gaussian entries. Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, the projections onto different \( \mathbf{a}_m \)&#x27;s are uncorrelated. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian, they are independent.

Therefore, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian random variable. Let me check. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), the inner product \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian variable. The mean is zero, because \( \mathbf{g} \) has zero mean. The variance is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_m = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{I} \mathbf{a}_m = \|\mathbf{a}_m\|^2 = 1 \), since each column has unit norm. Therefore, each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is distributed as \( CN(0,1) \). Furthermore, since the columns \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, for \( m \neq n \), the covariance between \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) and \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_n \) is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_n = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). Therefore, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent and identically distributed as \( CN(0,1) \).

Therefore, \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. Since they are independent, the sum would be \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), the variance becomes \( \frac{1}{M^2} \times M = \frac{1}{M} \). Therefore, \( x \sim CN\left(0, \frac{1}{M}\right) \). As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) tends to zero, so the distribution of \( x \) converges in probability to zero. In other words, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function at zero. But the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, which usually refers to convergence in distribution. However, if the variance is going to zero and the mean is zero, then the limiting distribution is a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me confirm. Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), so the real and imaginary parts are each \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/2) \). So when you take the average of \( M \) such terms, the real part is \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/(2M)) \) and the imaginary part is the same. So as \( M \to \infty \), both the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution, hence the entire complex random variable converges to zero in distribution.

But perhaps the problem expects a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem? Wait, but we are averaging independent complex Gaussians, so the average is also a complex Gaussian with decreasing variance. However, if we consider the real or imaginary part, each is a real Gaussian with variance \( 1/(2M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, hence the distribution becomes a delta function. So there&#x27;s a contradiction here: if we take the average of Gaussians with variance \( 1/M \), then yes, it tends to zero. However, maybe if \( N \) is also changing with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that.

Wait, the problem says \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \). If \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) must have orthogonal columns, which is impossible for \( M &gt; N \). Therefore, the problem might be in a regime where \( N \) is also increasing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), so \( \mathbf{A} \) is a square unitary matrix when \( M = N \). If \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as \( M \). Then, in that case, the columns are orthonormal, and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens to the average \( x \).

But even if \( N = M \), then each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), independent, so the average is \( CN(0, 1/M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), variance tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), as long as \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, and \( M \to \infty \), then \( x \) converges to zero in distribution.

But wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me check again. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns, then the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are in \( \mathbb{C}^N \) and are orthogonal. Therefore, if \( M \leq N \), they form an orthonormal set. If \( M &gt; N \), such a matrix cannot exist. Therefore, if the problem states \( M \) approaching infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity with \( M \leq N \). However, without loss of generality, if \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, the problem is ill-posed because \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem must assume that both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, perhaps with \( M = N \), or \( M \) growing proportionally to \( N \).

But the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed, but that&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is allowed to have approximately orthogonal columns? For example, in large MIMO systems, random matrices with independent columns are approximately orthogonal when the dimensions are large. But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so strictly orthogonal. Therefore, perhaps in the problem, \( N \) is also going to infinity with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this. Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \leq N \), but \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is fixed. Then as \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is finite, the limit is not infinity. So this is also problematic.

This is confusing. Maybe the key here is to note that regardless of the relation between \( M \) and \( N \), as long as the columns are orthogonal, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is independent, and the average tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a delta function at zero.

But let&#x27;s check with an example. Suppose \( N = 1 \), then \( \mathbf{A} \) would be a \( 1 \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns. But in \( \mathbb{C}^1 \), the only way to have orthogonal columns is that all columns are zero except one, but each column must have unit norm. Therefore, if \( N = 1 \), \( \mathbf{A} \) can only have one non-zero column, which is 1. Therefore, \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed 1. So if \( N = 1 \), \( M = 1 \). Therefore, if \( N \) is fixed, \( M \) can&#x27;t go to infinity. Therefore, the problem must have \( N \) going to infinity as \( M \) does. So in the limit, as \( M \to \infty \), \( N \to \infty \) as well. Then, even though each term is \( CN(0,1) \), the average of \( M \) terms is \( CN(0, 1/M) \), which tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), the average tends to zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with my independence assumption. Let&#x27;s consider if the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are not random but fixed. Then, the projections \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent because \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian and the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal. Therefore, even if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, as long as its columns are orthogonal, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent. Therefore, their average is a sum of independent Gaussians, which is Gaussian with variance scaling as \( 1/M \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, so the distribution becomes degenerate at zero.

Therefore, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta at zero, meaning that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero. But in terms of distribution, we might say that it converges in law to a constant, which has zero variance. So the answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

But wait, the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, so perhaps we need to state it as a normal distribution with variance zero, which is the same as a constant. In real analysis, the limiting distribution would be a degenerate normal distribution with mean zero and variance zero. So in that case, the limiting distribution is \( \delta_0 \), but in the context of complex distributions, it&#x27;s a complex normal distribution with zero mean and zero covariance.

But maybe the problem expects a different answer. Let me think again. Suppose the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are random, for example, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns (Haar distributed). Then, even though the columns are orthogonal, the randomness of \( \mathbf{A} \) could affect the distribution. However, the problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. Therefore, the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \).

Therefore, \( x \) is a sum of independent complex Gaussians divided by \( M \), leading to a complex Gaussian with variance \( 1/M \). As \( M \to \infty \), this tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a constant zero. However, in probability theory, convergence to a constant implies convergence in distribution to that constant. So the answer should be that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem, but since we are averaging Gaussians, the result is still Gaussian with variance decreasing to zero. So in the limit, it&#x27;s a constant. Therefore, the limiting distribution is deterministic zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \). Hence, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me check once more. Let&#x27;s suppose \( N \) is growing with \( M \), say \( N = M \). Then, \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( M \times M \) unitary matrix. Then, \( \mathbf{g} \) is an \( M \times 1 \) vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \). Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{A} \) is a row vector where each entry is \( CN(0,1) \), and the entries are independent because the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are orthonormal. Therefore, the average of these entries is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \), which is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \), where \( z_m \sim CN(0,1) \) iid. The sum \( \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \) is \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), we get \( CN(0, 1/M) \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), this converges in distribution to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is indeed a point mass at zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \) is a degenerate distribution at zero, which can be written as \( \delta_0 \). However, in the context of complex normal distributions, we can say that \( x \) converges in distribution to \( 0 \), which is equivalent to \( CN(0,0) \).

Alternatively, if we consider real and imaginary parts, each has variance \( 1/(2M) \), so as \( M \to \infty \), both variances go to zero, so the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution. Therefore, the conclusion is the same.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero, so \( x \) converges in probability and in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given an \( N \)-by-\( 1 \) complex Gaussian random vector \( \mathbf{g} \) with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \) and an \( N \)-by-\( M \) complex matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, we need to determine the limiting distribution of the scalar \( x \) defined as:
\[ x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \]
as \( M \) approaches infinity.

1. **Orthogonal Columns and Gaussian Vector**: Each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) of \( \mathbf{A} \) is orthogonal to others and has unit norm. The vector \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with independent components.

2. **Projection Analysis**: Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, these projections are uncorrelated and hence independent complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance (i.e., \( CN(0,1) \)).

3. **Sum of Independent Gaussians**: The scalar \( x \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. The sum of \( M \) such variables is \( CN(0, M) \), and dividing by \( M \) results in \( x \sim CN(0, \frac{1}{M}) \).

4. **Limiting Behavior**: As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) of \( x \) tends to zero. This implies that \( x \) converges in distribution to a degenerate distribution at zero.

Thus, the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

Response: Apparently we have \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_m = 1 \). Let&#x27;s let \(\mathbf{w}=\sum_m \mathbf{a}_m\) be some \(M \times N\) matrix such that each column is \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Then our \(x \) is: \(x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m. \) Our goal is to find the distribution of \(x\) as \(M \rightarrow \infty \). We can do that by finding \(E \{x\}\) and \(\text{var}(x)\) and see what happens as \(M \rightarrow \infty \). To find \(E \{x\}\), we notice that \[E \{x\} = E \left\{\frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \right \} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} E \left\{ \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \right \} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} E \left\{\mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{g} \right \} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \sum_{m=1}^{N} a_m(g_n) \mathbf{a}_{m,n} = M \sum_{n=1}^{N} a_n(g_n) = \mathbf{w}^H g. \] And to find \(\text{var}(x)\), we notice that \(\text{var}(x) = \text{var}\left( (\sum_a \alpha) \mathbf{a}_i \right) \). Using the fact that vacanares through 2 plus 3 and subtracting, we get that \(\text{var}(x)\) is: \(\text{var}(x) = \text{var}\left( \sum_a \alpha \right) \mathbf{a}_{i,i} + \text{var}\left( \mathbf{a}_{i}\right) \mathbf{a}_{i,i} = \text{var}\left( \sum_a \alpha \right) + \mathbf{a}_{i,i} = \mathbf{a}_{i,i}\) since \( \sum a \) has 0 variance. So our \(x\) should converge to a random scalar \(y\) such that \(E\{\psi [2]\} = \sum_i \psi [ 2] \mathbf{a}_{i,i} \) and \(D_{JL}(y) = \sum_i D_{JL} (\psi [2]) \mathbf{a}_{i,i}\) \boxed{ \sum_i D_{JL} (\psi [2]) \mathbf{a}_{i,i} \}. Answer: \boxed{ \sum_i D_{JL} (\psi [2]) \mathbf{a}_{i,i} }.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limiting distribution of the scalar value \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity. The setup is that \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), and \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns each of unit norm. The scalar \( x \) is defined as the average of \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) over all columns \( m \) from 1 to \( M \).

First, let me parse the problem. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector, meaning each component is a complex normal random variable, independent, with zero mean and unit variance. The matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns with unit norm, so each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) satisfies \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_m = 1 \), and for \( m \neq n \), \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). However, since \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \), if \( M &gt; N \), the columns can&#x27;t all be orthogonal in \( \mathbb{C}^N \). Wait, but orthogonal columns in an \( N \times M \) matrix require that \( M \leq N \), right? Because in a space of dimension \( N \), you can have at most \( N \) orthogonal vectors. So maybe in this problem, \( M \) is approaching infinity, but \( N \) is also going to infinity? Wait, the problem states that \( M \) approaches infinity, but it doesn&#x27;t specify the behavior of \( N \). Hmm, this is a bit unclear. If \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, that would require \( M \leq N \), so if \( M \) is going to infinity, then \( N \) must also be going to infinity. So perhaps in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, but with some relation? Or maybe \( N \) is fixed, and the question is ill-posed? Wait, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed. But then, how can \( \mathbf{A} \) have \( M \) orthogonal columns if \( M &gt; N \)? That&#x27;s impossible. So perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is semi-unitary, meaning that when \( M \leq N \), the columns are orthonormal, but here since \( M \) is approaching infinity, maybe \( N \) is also approaching infinity with \( M \), such that \( M/N \) approaches some constant? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous here.

Wait, let me check again. The problem states that \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) complex matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So each column has unit norm, and different columns are orthogonal. So if \( M \leq N \), such a matrix can exist, but if \( M &gt; N \), it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, if \( M \) approaches infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity to allow \( M \leq N \). So likely, in this problem, both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with \( M \leq N \), but the problem states &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is some function of \( M \), perhaps \( N \geq M \). However, since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify the relation between \( N \) and \( M \), perhaps we need to assume that \( N \) is fixed and \( M \leq N \), but then taking \( M \) to infinity would require \( N \) to be infinite as well, which is not possible. This seems contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows \( \mathbf{A} \) to have approximately orthogonal columns when \( M \) is large, but that&#x27;s not stated. The problem says &quot;orthogonal columns of unit norm&quot;, so strictly, they have to be exactly orthogonal. Therefore, I must conclude that \( M \leq N \), and as \( M \) approaches infinity, \( N \) must also approach infinity. So, perhaps we have a scenario where both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some fixed ratio. However, the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, not specifying \( N \), so maybe the answer will depend on the relation between \( M \) and \( N \). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are not exactly orthogonal but asymptotically orthogonal as \( M \) increases? But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so maybe the problem is in a regime where \( N \) is growing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), but then as \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as well. But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the key here is to compute the distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \), regardless of \( N \). But given that \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns of unit norm, if \( M \to \infty \), then \( N \) must also go to infinity. So perhaps they are taking the limit as both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity with some ratio. If the problem is from a wireless communications context, like a massive MIMO scenario, then maybe \( M \) and \( N \) are both large but with a fixed ratio, say \( M/N \) approaching a constant. But since the problem doesn&#x27;t specify, maybe we can proceed assuming that \( N \) is fixed, but then \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem as stated might have an issue. Alternatively, maybe the columns are not exactly orthogonal but the inner product between different columns is zero in expectation or something like that? But the problem states orthogonal columns, so that&#x27;s not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, like a Haar-distributed matrix. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns, then each \( \mathbf{a}_m \) is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere, and independent of each other. Wait, but if the columns are orthogonal, then they are not independent, since orthogonal vectors are dependent. So in that case, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthogonal columns, then the distribution is such that the columns form an orthonormal basis, but in that case, the distribution is the Haar measure on the Stiefel manifold.

But in the problem statement, \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns of unit norm. So unless specified otherwise, perhaps we can assume that the columns are arbitrary but fixed, except for \( \mathbf{g} \) which is random. Wait, but the problem says &quot;determine the limiting distribution of \( x \)&quot;, so the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \), or also over \( \mathbf{A} \)? The problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. So then, the problem is: for a given deterministic matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, compute the distribution of \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) as \( M \to \infty \). However, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, then \( x \) is a linear combination of Gaussian variables, so it&#x27;s Gaussian itself. Then, the question is about the mean and variance of \( x \), and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens.

But wait, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic with orthogonal columns, then the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent? Let&#x27;s see. \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), so \( \mathbf{g}^H \) is a row vector with complex Gaussian entries. Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, the projections onto different \( \mathbf{a}_m \)&#x27;s are uncorrelated. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian, they are independent.

Therefore, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian random variable. Let me check. Since \( \mathbf{g} \) is \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \), the inner product \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a complex Gaussian variable. The mean is zero, because \( \mathbf{g} \) has zero mean. The variance is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_m = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{I} \mathbf{a}_m = \|\mathbf{a}_m\|^2 = 1 \), since each column has unit norm. Therefore, each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is distributed as \( CN(0,1) \). Furthermore, since the columns \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, for \( m \neq n \), the covariance between \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) and \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_n \) is \( \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{g} \mathbf{g}^H] \mathbf{a}_n = \mathbf{a}_m^H \mathbf{a}_n = 0 \). Therefore, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent and identically distributed as \( CN(0,1) \).

Therefore, \( x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. Since they are independent, the sum would be \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), the variance becomes \( \frac{1}{M^2} \times M = \frac{1}{M} \). Therefore, \( x \sim CN\left(0, \frac{1}{M}\right) \). As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) tends to zero, so the distribution of \( x \) converges in probability to zero. In other words, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function at zero. But the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, which usually refers to convergence in distribution. However, if the variance is going to zero and the mean is zero, then the limiting distribution is a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me confirm. Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), so the real and imaginary parts are each \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/2) \). So when you take the average of \( M \) such terms, the real part is \( \mathcal{N}(0, 1/(2M)) \) and the imaginary part is the same. So as \( M \to \infty \), both the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution, hence the entire complex random variable converges to zero in distribution.

But perhaps the problem expects a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem? Wait, but we are averaging independent complex Gaussians, so the average is also a complex Gaussian with decreasing variance. However, if we consider the real or imaginary part, each is a real Gaussian with variance \( 1/(2M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, hence the distribution becomes a delta function. So there&#x27;s a contradiction here: if we take the average of Gaussians with variance \( 1/M \), then yes, it tends to zero. However, maybe if \( N \) is also changing with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that.

Wait, the problem says \( \mathbf{A} \) is \( N \times M \). If \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \) approaches infinity, but \( \mathbf{A} \) must have orthogonal columns, which is impossible for \( M &gt; N \). Therefore, the problem might be in a regime where \( N \) is also increasing with \( M \), such that \( M \leq N \). For example, if \( N = M \), so \( \mathbf{A} \) is a square unitary matrix when \( M = N \). If \( M \) increases, \( N \) increases as \( M \). Then, in that case, the columns are orthonormal, and as \( M \to \infty \), what happens to the average \( x \).

But even if \( N = M \), then each \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is \( CN(0,1) \), independent, so the average is \( CN(0, 1/M) \). So as \( M \to \infty \), variance tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), as long as \( \mathbf{A} \) has orthogonal columns, and \( M \to \infty \), then \( x \) converges to zero in distribution.

But wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me check again. If \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( N \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns, then the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are in \( \mathbb{C}^N \) and are orthogonal. Therefore, if \( M \leq N \), they form an orthonormal set. If \( M &gt; N \), such a matrix cannot exist. Therefore, if the problem states \( M \) approaching infinity, then \( N \) must also approach infinity with \( M \leq N \). However, without loss of generality, if \( N \) is fixed and \( M \) approaches infinity, the problem is ill-posed because \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed \( N \). Therefore, the problem must assume that both \( M \) and \( N \) go to infinity, perhaps with \( M = N \), or \( M \) growing proportionally to \( N \).

But the problem says &quot;as \( M \) approaches infinity&quot;, so maybe \( N \) is fixed, but that&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, perhaps the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) is allowed to have approximately orthogonal columns? For example, in large MIMO systems, random matrices with independent columns are approximately orthogonal when the dimensions are large. But the problem says &quot;orthogonal columns&quot;, so strictly orthogonal. Therefore, perhaps in the problem, \( N \) is also going to infinity with \( M \), but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this. Hmmm.

Alternatively, maybe \( N \) is fixed, and \( M \leq N \), but \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is fixed. Then as \( M \) approaches \( N \), which is finite, the limit is not infinity. So this is also problematic.

This is confusing. Maybe the key here is to note that regardless of the relation between \( M \) and \( N \), as long as the columns are orthogonal, each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is independent, and the average tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a delta function at zero.

But let&#x27;s check with an example. Suppose \( N = 1 \), then \( \mathbf{A} \) would be a \( 1 \times M \) matrix with orthogonal columns. But in \( \mathbb{C}^1 \), the only way to have orthogonal columns is that all columns are zero except one, but each column must have unit norm. Therefore, if \( N = 1 \), \( \mathbf{A} \) can only have one non-zero column, which is 1. Therefore, \( M \) can&#x27;t exceed 1. So if \( N = 1 \), \( M = 1 \). Therefore, if \( N \) is fixed, \( M \) can&#x27;t go to infinity. Therefore, the problem must have \( N \) going to infinity as \( M \) does. So in the limit, as \( M \to \infty \), \( N \to \infty \) as well. Then, even though each term is \( CN(0,1) \), the average of \( M \) terms is \( CN(0, 1/M) \), which tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of \( N \), the average tends to zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with my independence assumption. Let&#x27;s consider if the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are not random but fixed. Then, the projections \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent because \( \mathbf{g} \) is Gaussian and the vectors \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal. Therefore, even if \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic, as long as its columns are orthogonal, the terms \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) are independent. Therefore, their average is a sum of independent Gaussians, which is Gaussian with variance scaling as \( 1/M \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), the variance goes to zero, so the distribution becomes degenerate at zero.

Therefore, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta at zero, meaning that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero. But in terms of distribution, we might say that it converges in law to a constant, which has zero variance. So the answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

But wait, the problem says &quot;limiting distribution&quot;, so perhaps we need to state it as a normal distribution with variance zero, which is the same as a constant. In real analysis, the limiting distribution would be a degenerate normal distribution with mean zero and variance zero. So in that case, the limiting distribution is \( \delta_0 \), but in the context of complex distributions, it&#x27;s a complex normal distribution with zero mean and zero covariance.

But maybe the problem expects a different answer. Let me think again. Suppose the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are random, for example, if \( \mathbf{A} \) is a random matrix with orthonormal columns (Haar distributed). Then, even though the columns are orthogonal, the randomness of \( \mathbf{A} \) could affect the distribution. However, the problem states \( \mathbf{g} \) is a random vector, but \( \mathbf{A} \) is just given as a matrix with orthogonal columns. So unless specified, \( \mathbf{A} \) is deterministic. Therefore, the randomness is only over \( \mathbf{g} \).

Therefore, \( x \) is a sum of independent complex Gaussians divided by \( M \), leading to a complex Gaussian with variance \( 1/M \). As \( M \to \infty \), this tends to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is a constant zero. However, in probability theory, convergence to a constant implies convergence in distribution to that constant. So the answer should be that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem, but since we are averaging Gaussians, the result is still Gaussian with variance decreasing to zero. So in the limit, it&#x27;s a constant. Therefore, the limiting distribution is deterministic zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that \( x \) converges in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \). Hence, the limiting distribution is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

But let me check once more. Let&#x27;s suppose \( N \) is growing with \( M \), say \( N = M \). Then, \( \mathbf{A} \) is an \( M \times M \) unitary matrix. Then, \( \mathbf{g} \) is an \( M \times 1 \) vector \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \). Then, \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{A} \) is a row vector where each entry is \( CN(0,1) \), and the entries are independent because the columns of \( \mathbf{A} \) are orthonormal. Therefore, the average of these entries is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \), which is \( \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \), where \( z_m \sim CN(0,1) \) iid. The sum \( \sum_{m=1}^M z_m \) is \( CN(0, M) \), so dividing by \( M \), we get \( CN(0, 1/M) \). Therefore, as \( M \to \infty \), this converges in distribution to zero. Therefore, the limiting distribution is indeed a point mass at zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is that the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \to \infty \) is a degenerate distribution at zero, which can be written as \( \delta_0 \). However, in the context of complex normal distributions, we can say that \( x \) converges in distribution to \( 0 \), which is equivalent to \( CN(0,0) \).

Alternatively, if we consider real and imaginary parts, each has variance \( 1/(2M) \), so as \( M \to \infty \), both variances go to zero, so the real and imaginary parts converge to zero in distribution. Therefore, the conclusion is the same.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is that the limiting distribution is a point mass at zero, so \( x \) converges in probability and in distribution to zero as \( M \to \infty \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}

Given an \( N \)-by-\( 1 \) complex Gaussian random vector \( \mathbf{g} \) with distribution \( CN(0, \mathbf{I}) \) and an \( N \)-by-\( M \) complex matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) with orthogonal columns of unit norm, we need to determine the limiting distribution of the scalar \( x \) defined as:
\[ x = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \]
as \( M \) approaches infinity.

1. **Orthogonal Columns and Gaussian Vector**: Each column \( \mathbf{a}_m \) of \( \mathbf{A} \) is orthogonal to others and has unit norm. The vector \( \mathbf{g} \) is a complex Gaussian random vector with independent components.

2. **Projection Analysis**: Each term \( \mathbf{g}^H \mathbf{a}_m \) is a projection of \( \mathbf{g} \) onto \( \mathbf{a}_m \). Since \( \mathbf{a}_m \) are orthogonal, these projections are uncorrelated and hence independent complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance (i.e., \( CN(0,1) \)).

3. **Sum of Independent Gaussians**: The scalar \( x \) is the average of \( M \) independent \( CN(0,1) \) random variables. The sum of \( M \) such variables is \( CN(0, M) \), and dividing by \( M \) results in \( x \sim CN(0, \frac{1}{M}) \).

4. **Limiting Behavior**: As \( M \to \infty \), the variance \( \frac{1}{M} \) of \( x \) tends to zero. This implies that \( x \) converges in distribution to a degenerate distribution at zero.

Thus, the limiting distribution of \( x \) as \( M \) approaches infinity is a Dirac delta function centered at zero, or equivalently, a degenerate distribution at zero.

Problem: Consider a sequence of integer-valued random variables \( \{ X_{n}(\omega)\} \) on a probability space \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})\) such that \( X_{n}\overset{a.s.}{\to} c \), where \( c \) is an integer constant. Define \( N(\omega) = \min \{n_{2} \geq 1: X_{n}(\omega) = c, \forall n &gt; n_{2}\} \). Is it true that \( \mathbb{P}[N &lt; \infty] = 1 \)? Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: We can&#x27;t say this, as the sequence of variable \( X_{n} \) is just an approximation of \( c \) and hence the constant random variable may not have any linear trend.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about almost sure convergence of integer-valued random variables to a constant integer and whether the random variable N, defined as the minimum n₂ such that from that point onward all Xₙ are equal to c, is almost surely finite. So, we need to determine if ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

First, let me recall what almost sure convergence means. Xₙ converges almost surely to c if the probability that Xₙ approaches c as n goes to infinity is 1. Formally, ℙ[ω ∈ Ω : limₙ→∞ Xₙ(ω) = c] = 1. This means that for almost every ω (except possibly a set of measure zero), the sequence Xₙ(ω) will eventually equal c and stay there forever. Wait, actually, does almost sure convergence necessarily mean that the sequence will eventually equal c and stay there, or just that it gets arbitrarily close?

But here, the random variables are integer-valued. So c is an integer, and each Xₙ takes integer values. So if Xₙ converges to c almost surely, then for almost every ω, there exists some N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Because in the integers, to converge to c, you have to be eventually equal to c. Because otherwise, if the sequence doesn&#x27;t eventually become c, there would be some ε &gt; 0 such that infinitely many Xₙ are at least ε away from c. But since we&#x27;re dealing with integers, the distance between c and any other integer is at least 1. So if Xₙ(ω) doesn&#x27;t eventually stay at c, then there are infinitely many n where |Xₙ(ω) - c| ≥ 1, which would contradict convergence to c. Therefore, almost sure convergence in this context implies that for almost every ω, Xₙ(ω) is eventually equal to c.

Therefore, the definition of N(ω) as the minimal n₂ such that for all n &gt; n₂, Xₙ(ω) = c, should be almost surely finite. Because for almost every ω, such an n₂ exists. Therefore, N(ω) is finite almost surely. Hence, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] should be 1.

Wait, but let me check if this reasoning is correct. Let me formalize it a bit.

Suppose Xₙ → c almost surely. Then, by definition, the set A = {ω ∈ Ω : limₙ→∞ Xₙ(ω) = c} has ℙ(A) = 1. For any ω ∈ A, since the limit is c, and Xₙ(ω) are integers, then there exists N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Because if not, then there would be infinitely many n with Xₙ(ω) ≠ c, but since the variables are integer-valued, |Xₙ(ω) - c| ≥ 1 for those n, contradicting the convergence to c. Therefore, for every ω in A, N(ω) is finite. Since ℙ(A) = 1, it follows that ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose someone argues that convergence almost surely allows for some ω where convergence doesn&#x27;t hold, but those ω have probability zero. So N(ω) is finite for all ω in A, which has probability 1, hence N is almost surely finite.

But perhaps I should be careful here. Let&#x27;s write it more formally.

Given Xₙ → c a.s., which means that there exists a set B ∈ F with ℙ(B) = 1 such that for all ω ∈ B, limₙ→∞ Xₙ(ω) = c. For each ω ∈ B, since Xₙ(ω) converges to c and takes integer values, there exists an integer N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is finite for all ω ∈ B, which has probability 1. Therefore, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] ≥ ℙ(B) = 1, so ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

Therefore, yes, it is true that ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

But let me check with an example. Suppose we have a sequence where Xₙ = c for all n ≥ some random time N, and before that, Xₙ can be different. If N is finite almost surely, then yes. But here, the question is whether the almost sure convergence implies that such an N exists almost surely.

Wait, another angle: almost sure convergence is equivalent to ℙ(lim supₙ→∞ |Xₙ - c| ≥ ε) = 0 for all ε &gt; 0. For integer-valued variables, take ε = 1/2. Then |Xₙ - c| ≥ 1/2 is equivalent to Xₙ ≠ c. Therefore, ℙ(lim supₙ→∞ {Xₙ ≠ c}) = 0. But lim sup {Xₙ ≠ c} is the event that Xₙ ≠ c infinitely often. So ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, if the events {Xₙ ≠ c} are such that their probabilities are summable, then ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0. But here we don&#x27;t know if the probabilities are summable, we only know that the lim sup has probability zero. However, in general, if ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0, that is equivalent to Xₙ → c almost surely. Then, this implies that almost surely, only finitely many Xₙ differ from c. Hence, there exists some N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is the last time that Xₙ(ω) ≠ c, plus one. So if there are only finitely many exceptions, N(ω) is finite. Therefore, again, ℙ(N &lt; ∞) = 1.

Yes, that seems to confirm the conclusion.

Alternatively, suppose we model a simple case where each Xₙ is c with probability 1 - pₙ and some other integer with probability pₙ. If ∑ pₙ &lt; ∞, then by Borel-Cantelli, almost surely only finitely many Xₙ are not c, so N is finite a.s. But even if ∑ pₙ is not finite, but Xₙ → c a.s., then even though infinitely many Xₙ may be different from c with positive probability, the definition of a.s. convergence would require that lim Xₙ = c, which in integers requires that Xₙ is eventually c. So even if there are infinitely many n with Xₙ ≠ c, the limit existing and being c would force that beyond some N(ω), all Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is finite.

Wait, but in that case, how can you have infinitely many Xₙ ≠ c but still have Xₙ → c? In integers, you can&#x27;t. If Xₙ is equal to c for all sufficiently large n, then the limit is c. If not, there are infinitely many n with Xₙ ≠ c, which in integers means |Xₙ - c| ≥ 1, so the limit would not exist or not be c. Therefore, convergence in the integers to c a.s. implies that the sequence is eventually constant c. Therefore, N(ω) is the last time it differs from c, which is finite.

Hence, in conclusion, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

Given a sequence of integer-valued random variables \( \{ X_{n}(\omega) \} \) on a probability space \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})\) such that \( X_{n} \overset{a.s.}{\to} c \), where \( c \) is an integer constant, we need to determine if \( \mathbb{P}[N &lt; \infty] = 1 \) for \( N(\omega) = \min \{ n_{2} \geq 1 : X_{n}(\omega) = c, \forall n &gt; n_{2} \} \).

1. **Almost Sure Convergence**: By definition, \( X_{n} \overset{a.s.}{\to} c \) means there exists a set \( A \subseteq \Omega \) with \( \mathbb{P}(A) = 1 \) such that for every \( \omega \in A \), \( \lim_{n \to \infty} X_{n}(\omega) = c \).

2. **Convergence in Integer-Valued Sequences**: For integer-valued random variables, convergence to an integer \( c \) implies that the sequence must eventually be equal to \( c \). This is because the distance between any integer different from \( c \) and \( c \) is at least 1. Hence, if \( X_{n}(\omega) \) converges to \( c \), there must exist some \( N(\omega) \) such that for all \( n \geq N(\omega) \), \( X_{n}(\omega) = c \).

3. **Implications for \( N(\omega) \)**: For each \( \omega \in A \), \( N(\omega) \) is the smallest integer such that \( X_{n}(\omega) = c \) for all \( n &gt; N(\omega) \). Since \( \mathbb{P}(A) = 1 \), it follows that \( N(\omega) \) is finite for almost every \( \omega \).

4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}[N &lt; \infty] = 1 \) because the set where \( N(\omega) \) is infinite is a subset of the complement of \( A \), which has measure zero.

Problem: Consider a sequence of integer-valued random variables \( \{ X_{n}(\omega)\} \) on a probability space \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})\) such that \( X_{n}\overset{a.s.}{\to} c \), where \( c \) is an integer constant.

Response: Let&#x27;s think about the distribution of \( X_{n}(\omega) \) and the density \( f_{N}(t) \) of \( N \). Since \( X_{n} \overset{a.s.}{\to} c \), \( X_{n}(\omega) = c \\) for some index \( n_{2} \). So the density of \( N \) is 0 for \( t &lt; n_{2} \) and 1 for \( t \geq n_{2} \) because if we observe \( X_{n} = c \) for \( n &gt; n_{2} \), then \( N(\omega) = n_{2} \). \boxed{Yes}          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about almost sure convergence of integer-valued random variables to a constant integer and whether the random variable N, defined as the minimum n₂ such that from that point onward all Xₙ are equal to c, is almost surely finite. So, we need to determine if ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

First, let me recall what almost sure convergence means. Xₙ converges almost surely to c if the probability that Xₙ approaches c as n goes to infinity is 1. Formally, ℙ[ω ∈ Ω : limₙ→∞ Xₙ(ω) = c] = 1. This means that for almost every ω (except possibly a set of measure zero), the sequence Xₙ(ω) will eventually equal c and stay there forever. Wait, actually, does almost sure convergence necessarily mean that the sequence will eventually equal c and stay there, or just that it gets arbitrarily close?

But here, the random variables are integer-valued. So c is an integer, and each Xₙ takes integer values. So if Xₙ converges to c almost surely, then for almost every ω, there exists some N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Because in the integers, to converge to c, you have to be eventually equal to c. Because otherwise, if the sequence doesn&#x27;t eventually become c, there would be some ε &gt; 0 such that infinitely many Xₙ are at least ε away from c. But since we&#x27;re dealing with integers, the distance between c and any other integer is at least 1. So if Xₙ(ω) doesn&#x27;t eventually stay at c, then there are infinitely many n where |Xₙ(ω) - c| ≥ 1, which would contradict convergence to c. Therefore, almost sure convergence in this context implies that for almost every ω, Xₙ(ω) is eventually equal to c.

Therefore, the definition of N(ω) as the minimal n₂ such that for all n &gt; n₂, Xₙ(ω) = c, should be almost surely finite. Because for almost every ω, such an n₂ exists. Therefore, N(ω) is finite almost surely. Hence, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] should be 1.

Wait, but let me check if this reasoning is correct. Let me formalize it a bit.

Suppose Xₙ → c almost surely. Then, by definition, the set A = {ω ∈ Ω : limₙ→∞ Xₙ(ω) = c} has ℙ(A) = 1. For any ω ∈ A, since the limit is c, and Xₙ(ω) are integers, then there exists N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Because if not, then there would be infinitely many n with Xₙ(ω) ≠ c, but since the variables are integer-valued, |Xₙ(ω) - c| ≥ 1 for those n, contradicting the convergence to c. Therefore, for every ω in A, N(ω) is finite. Since ℙ(A) = 1, it follows that ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose someone argues that convergence almost surely allows for some ω where convergence doesn&#x27;t hold, but those ω have probability zero. So N(ω) is finite for all ω in A, which has probability 1, hence N is almost surely finite.

But perhaps I should be careful here. Let&#x27;s write it more formally.

Given Xₙ → c a.s., which means that there exists a set B ∈ F with ℙ(B) = 1 such that for all ω ∈ B, limₙ→∞ Xₙ(ω) = c. For each ω ∈ B, since Xₙ(ω) converges to c and takes integer values, there exists an integer N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is finite for all ω ∈ B, which has probability 1. Therefore, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] ≥ ℙ(B) = 1, so ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

Therefore, yes, it is true that ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

But let me check with an example. Suppose we have a sequence where Xₙ = c for all n ≥ some random time N, and before that, Xₙ can be different. If N is finite almost surely, then yes. But here, the question is whether the almost sure convergence implies that such an N exists almost surely.

Wait, another angle: almost sure convergence is equivalent to ℙ(lim supₙ→∞ |Xₙ - c| ≥ ε) = 0 for all ε &gt; 0. For integer-valued variables, take ε = 1/2. Then |Xₙ - c| ≥ 1/2 is equivalent to Xₙ ≠ c. Therefore, ℙ(lim supₙ→∞ {Xₙ ≠ c}) = 0. But lim sup {Xₙ ≠ c} is the event that Xₙ ≠ c infinitely often. So ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, if the events {Xₙ ≠ c} are such that their probabilities are summable, then ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0. But here we don&#x27;t know if the probabilities are summable, we only know that the lim sup has probability zero. However, in general, if ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0, that is equivalent to Xₙ → c almost surely. Then, this implies that almost surely, only finitely many Xₙ differ from c. Hence, there exists some N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is the last time that Xₙ(ω) ≠ c, plus one. So if there are only finitely many exceptions, N(ω) is finite. Therefore, again, ℙ(N &lt; ∞) = 1.

Yes, that seems to confirm the conclusion.

Alternatively, suppose we model a simple case where each Xₙ is c with probability 1 - pₙ and some other integer with probability pₙ. If ∑ pₙ &lt; ∞, then by Borel-Cantelli, almost surely only finitely many Xₙ are not c, so N is finite a.s. But even if ∑ pₙ is not finite, but Xₙ → c a.s., then even though infinitely many Xₙ may be different from c with positive probability, the definition of a.s. convergence would require that lim Xₙ = c, which in integers requires that Xₙ is eventually c. So even if there are infinitely many n with Xₙ ≠ c, the limit existing and being c would force that beyond some N(ω), all Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is finite.

Wait, but in that case, how can you have infinitely many Xₙ ≠ c but still have Xₙ → c? In integers, you can&#x27;t. If Xₙ is equal to c for all sufficiently large n, then the limit is c. If not, there are infinitely many n with Xₙ ≠ c, which in integers means |Xₙ - c| ≥ 1, so the limit would not exist or not be c. Therefore, convergence in the integers to c a.s. implies that the sequence is eventually constant c. Therefore, N(ω) is the last time it differs from c, which is finite.

Hence, in conclusion, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

Given a sequence of integer-valued random variables \( \{ X_{n}(\omega) \} \) on a probability space \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})\) such that \( X_{n} \overset{a.s.}{\to} c \), where \( c \) is an integer constant, we need to determine if \( \mathbb{P}[N &lt; \infty] = 1 \) for \( N(\omega) = \min \{ n_{2} \geq 1 : X_{n}(\omega) = c, \forall n &gt; n_{2} \} \).

1. **Almost Sure Convergence**: By definition, \( X_{n} \overset{a.s.}{\to} c \) means there exists a set \( A \subseteq \Omega \) with \( \mathbb{P}(A) = 1 \) such that for every \( \omega \in A \), \( \lim_{n \to \infty} X_{n}(\omega) = c \).

2. **Convergence in Integer-Valued Sequences**: For integer-valued random variables, convergence to an integer \( c \) implies that the sequence must eventually be equal to \( c \). This is because the distance between any integer different from \( c \) and \( c \) is at least 1. Hence, if \( X_{n}(\omega) \) converges to \( c \), there must exist some \( N(\omega) \) such that for all \( n \geq N(\omega) \), \( X_{n}(\omega) = c \).

3. **Implications for \( N(\omega) \)**: For each \( \omega \in A \), \( N(\omega) \) is the smallest integer such that \( X_{n}(\omega) = c \) for all \( n &gt; N(\omega) \). Since \( \mathbb{P}(A) = 1 \), it follows that \( N(\omega) \) is finite for almost every \( \omega \).

4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}[N &lt; \infty] = 1 \) because the set where \( N(\omega) \) is infinite is a subset of the complement of \( A \), which has measure zero.

2. **Convergence in Integer-Valued Sequences**: For integer-valued random variables, convergence to an integer \( c \) implies that the sequence must eventually be equal to \( c \). This is because the distance between any integer different from \( c \) and \( c \) is at least 1. Hence, if \( X_{n}(\omega) \) converges to \( c \), there must exist some \( N(\omega) \) such that for all \( n \geq N(\omega) \), \( X_{n}(\omega) = c \).

3. **Implications for \( N(\omega) \)**: For each \( \omega \in A \), \( N(\omega) \) is the smallest integer such that \( X_{n}(\omega) = c \) for all \( n &gt; N(\omega) \). Since \( \mathbb{P}(A) = 1 \), it follows that \( N(\omega) \) is finite for almost every \( \omega \).

4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}[N &lt; \infty] = 1 \) because the set where \( N(\omega) \) is infinite is a subset of the complement of \( A \), which has measure zero.

Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about almost sure convergence of integer-valued random variables to a constant integer and whether the random variable N, defined as the minimum n₂ such that from that point onward all Xₙ are equal to c, is almost surely finite. So, we need to determine if ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

First, let me recall what almost sure convergence means. Xₙ converges almost surely to c if the probability that Xₙ approaches c as n goes to infinity is 1. Formally, ℙ[ω ∈ Ω : limₙ→∞ Xₙ(ω) = c] = 1. This means that for almost every ω (except possibly a set of measure zero), the sequence Xₙ(ω) will eventually equal c and stay there forever. Wait, actually, does almost sure convergence necessarily mean that the sequence will eventually equal c and stay there, or just that it gets arbitrarily close?

But here, the random variables are integer-valued. So c is an integer, and each Xₙ takes integer values. So if Xₙ converges to c almost surely, then for almost every ω, there exists some N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Because in the integers, to converge to c, you have to be eventually equal to c. Because otherwise, if the sequence doesn&#x27;t eventually become c, there would be some ε &gt; 0 such that infinitely many Xₙ are at least ε away from c. But since we&#x27;re dealing with integers, the distance between c and any other integer is at least 1. So if Xₙ(ω) doesn&#x27;t eventually stay at c, then there are infinitely many n where |Xₙ(ω) - c| ≥ 1, which would contradict convergence to c. Therefore, almost sure convergence in this context implies that for almost every ω, Xₙ(ω) is eventually equal to c.

Therefore, the definition of N(ω) as the minimal n₂ such that for all n &gt; n₂, Xₙ(ω) = c, should be almost surely finite. Because for almost every ω, such an n₂ exists. Therefore, N(ω) is finite almost surely. Hence, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] should be 1.

Wait, but let me check if this reasoning is correct. Let me formalize it a bit.

Suppose Xₙ → c almost surely. Then, by definition, the set A = {ω ∈ Ω : limₙ→∞ Xₙ(ω) = c} has ℙ(A) = 1. For any ω ∈ A, since the limit is c, and Xₙ(ω) are integers, then there exists N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Because if not, then there would be infinitely many n with Xₙ(ω) ≠ c, but since the variables are integer-valued, |Xₙ(ω) - c| ≥ 1 for those n, contradicting the convergence to c. Therefore, for every ω in A, N(ω) is finite. Since ℙ(A) = 1, it follows that ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose someone argues that convergence almost surely allows for some ω where convergence doesn&#x27;t hold, but those ω have probability zero. So N(ω) is finite for all ω in A, which has probability 1, hence N is almost surely finite.

But perhaps I should be careful here. Let&#x27;s write it more formally.

Given Xₙ → c a.s., which means that there exists a set B ∈ F with ℙ(B) = 1 such that for all ω ∈ B, limₙ→∞ Xₙ(ω) = c. For each ω ∈ B, since Xₙ(ω) converges to c and takes integer values, there exists an integer N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is finite for all ω ∈ B, which has probability 1. Therefore, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] ≥ ℙ(B) = 1, so ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

Therefore, yes, it is true that ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

But let me check with an example. Suppose we have a sequence where Xₙ = c for all n ≥ some random time N, and before that, Xₙ can be different. If N is finite almost surely, then yes. But here, the question is whether the almost sure convergence implies that such an N exists almost surely.

Wait, another angle: almost sure convergence is equivalent to ℙ(lim supₙ→∞ |Xₙ - c| ≥ ε) = 0 for all ε &gt; 0. For integer-valued variables, take ε = 1/2. Then |Xₙ - c| ≥ 1/2 is equivalent to Xₙ ≠ c. Therefore, ℙ(lim supₙ→∞ {Xₙ ≠ c}) = 0. But lim sup {Xₙ ≠ c} is the event that Xₙ ≠ c infinitely often. So ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, if the events {Xₙ ≠ c} are such that their probabilities are summable, then ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0. But here we don&#x27;t know if the probabilities are summable, we only know that the lim sup has probability zero. However, in general, if ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0, that is equivalent to Xₙ → c almost surely. Then, this implies that almost surely, only finitely many Xₙ differ from c. Hence, there exists some N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is the last time that Xₙ(ω) ≠ c, plus one. So if there are only finitely many exceptions, N(ω) is finite. Therefore, again, ℙ(N &lt; ∞) = 1.

Yes, that seems to confirm the conclusion.

Alternatively, suppose we model a simple case where each Xₙ is c with probability 1 - pₙ and some other integer with probability pₙ. If ∑ pₙ &lt; ∞, then by Borel-Cantelli, almost surely only finitely many Xₙ are not c, so N is finite a.s. But even if ∑ pₙ is not finite, but Xₙ → c a.s., then even though infinitely many Xₙ may be different from c with positive probability, the definition of a.s. convergence would require that lim Xₙ = c, which in integers requires that Xₙ is eventually c. So even if there are infinitely many n with Xₙ ≠ c, the limit existing and being c would force that beyond some N(ω), all Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is finite.

Wait, but in that case, how can you have infinitely many Xₙ ≠ c but still have Xₙ → c? In integers, you can&#x27;t. If Xₙ is equal to c for all sufficiently large n, then the limit is c. If not, there are infinitely many n with Xₙ ≠ c, which in integers means |Xₙ - c| ≥ 1, so the limit would not exist or not be c. Therefore, convergence in the integers to c a.s. implies that the sequence is eventually constant c. Therefore, N(ω) is the last time it differs from c, which is finite.

Hence, in conclusion, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

Response: In essence, this means that the sequence \( X_{n} \) should converge to a constant \( c \).

If ∑ pₙ &lt; ∞, then by Borel-Cantelli, almost surely only finitely many Xₙ are not c, so N is finite a.s. But even if ∑ pₙ is not finite, but Xₙ → c a.s., then even though infinitely many Xₙ may be different from c with positive probability, the definition of a.s. convergence would require that lim Xₙ = c, which in integers requires that Xₙ is eventually c. So even if there are infinitely many n with Xₙ ≠ c, the limit existing and being c would force that beyond some N(ω), all Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is finite.

Wait, but in that case, how can you have infinitely many Xₙ ≠ c but still have Xₙ → c? In integers, you can&#x27;t. If Xₙ is equal to c for all sufficiently large n, then the limit is c. If not, there are infinitely many n with Xₙ ≠ c, which in integers means |Xₙ - c| ≥ 1, so the limit would not exist or not be c. Therefore, convergence in the integers to c a.s. implies that the sequence is eventually constant c. Therefore, N(ω) is the last time it differs from c, which is finite.

Hence, in conclusion, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

Given a sequence of integer-valued random variables \( \{ X_{n}(\omega) \} \) on a probability space \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})\) such that \( X_{n} \overset{a.s.}{\to} c \), where \( c \) is an integer constant, we need to determine if \( \mathbb{P}[N &lt; \infty] = 1 \) for \( N(\omega) = \min \{ n_{2} \geq 1 : X_{n}(\omega) = c, \forall n &gt; n_{2} \} \).

1. **Almost Sure Convergence**: By definition, \( X_{n} \overset{a.s.}{\to} c \) means there exists a set \( A \subseteq \Omega \) with \( \mathbb{P}(A) = 1 \) such that for every \( \omega \in A \), \( \lim_{n \to \infty} X_{n}(\omega) = c \).

2. **Convergence in Integer-Valued Sequences**: For integer-valued random variables, convergence to an integer \( c \) implies that the sequence must eventually be equal to \( c \). This is because the distance between any integer different from \( c \) and \( c \) is at least 1. Hence, if \( X_{n}(\omega) \) converges to \( c \), there must exist some \( N(\omega) \) such that for all \( n \geq N(\omega) \), \( X_{n}(\omega) = c \).

3. **Implications for \( N(\omega) \)**: For each \( \omega \in A \), \( N(\omega) \) is the smallest integer such that \( X_{n}(\omega) = c \) for all \( n &gt; N(\omega) \). Since \( \mathbb{P}(A) = 1 \), it follows that \( N(\omega) \) is finite for almost every \( \omega \).

4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}[N &lt; \infty] = 1 \) because the set where \( N(\omega) \) is infinite is a subset of the complement of \( A \), which has measure zero.

Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about almost sure convergence of integer-valued random variables to a constant integer and whether the random variable N, defined as the minimum n₂ such that from that point onward all Xₙ are equal to c, is almost surely finite. So, we need to determine if ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

First, let me recall what almost sure convergence means. Xₙ converges almost surely to c if the probability that Xₙ approaches c as n goes to infinity is 1. Formally, ℙ[ω ∈ Ω : limₙ→∞ Xₙ(ω) = c] = 1. This means that for almost every ω (except possibly a set of measure zero), the sequence Xₙ(ω) will eventually equal c and stay there forever. Wait, actually, does almost sure convergence necessarily mean that the sequence will eventually equal c and stay there, or just that it gets arbitrarily close?

But here, the random variables are integer-valued. So c is an integer, and each Xₙ takes integer values. So if Xₙ converges to c almost surely, then for almost every ω, there exists some N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Because in the integers, to converge to c, you have to be eventually equal to c. Because otherwise, if the sequence doesn&#x27;t eventually become c, there would be some ε &gt; 0 such that infinitely many Xₙ are at least ε away from c. But since we&#x27;re dealing with integers, the distance between c and any other integer is at least 1. So if Xₙ(ω) doesn&#x27;t eventually stay at c, then there are infinitely many n where |Xₙ(ω) - c| ≥ 1, which would contradict convergence to c. Therefore, almost sure convergence in this context implies that for almost every ω, Xₙ(ω) is eventually equal to c.

Therefore, the definition of N(ω) as the minimal n₂ such that for all n &gt; n₂, Xₙ(ω) = c, should be almost surely finite. Because for almost every ω, such an n₂ exists. Therefore, N(ω) is finite almost surely. Hence, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] should be 1.

Wait, but let me check if this reasoning is correct. Let me formalize it a bit.

Suppose Xₙ → c almost surely. Then, by definition, the set A = {ω ∈ Ω : limₙ→∞ Xₙ(ω) = c} has ℙ(A) = 1. For any ω ∈ A, since the limit is c, and Xₙ(ω) are integers, then there exists N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Because if not, then there would be infinitely many n with Xₙ(ω) ≠ c, but since the variables are integer-valued, |Xₙ(ω) - c| ≥ 1 for those n, contradicting the convergence to c. Therefore, for every ω in A, N(ω) is finite. Since ℙ(A) = 1, it follows that ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose someone argues that convergence almost surely allows for some ω where convergence doesn&#x27;t hold, but those ω have probability zero. So N(ω) is finite for all ω in A, which has probability 1, hence N is almost surely finite.

But perhaps I should be careful here. Let&#x27;s write it more formally.

Given Xₙ → c a.s., which means that there exists a set B ∈ F with ℙ(B) = 1 such that for all ω ∈ B, limₙ→∞ Xₙ(ω) = c. For each ω ∈ B, since Xₙ(ω) converges to c and takes integer values, there exists an integer N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is finite for all ω ∈ B, which has probability 1. Therefore, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] ≥ ℙ(B) = 1, so ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

Therefore, yes, it is true that ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

But let me check with an example. Suppose we have a sequence where Xₙ = c for all n ≥ some random time N, and before that, Xₙ can be different. If N is finite almost surely, then yes. But here, the question is whether the almost sure convergence implies that such an N exists almost surely.

Wait, another angle: almost sure convergence is equivalent to ℙ(lim supₙ→∞ |Xₙ - c| ≥ ε) = 0 for all ε &gt; 0. For integer-valued variables, take ε = 1/2. Then |Xₙ - c| ≥ 1/2 is equivalent to Xₙ ≠ c. Therefore, ℙ(lim supₙ→∞ {Xₙ ≠ c}) = 0. But lim sup {Xₙ ≠ c} is the event that Xₙ ≠ c infinitely often. So ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, if the events {Xₙ ≠ c} are such that their probabilities are summable, then ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0. But here we don&#x27;t know if the probabilities are summable, we only know that the lim sup has probability zero. However, in general, if ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0, that is equivalent to Xₙ → c almost surely. Then, this implies that almost surely, only finitely many Xₙ differ from c. Hence, there exists some N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is the last time that Xₙ(ω) ≠ c, plus one. So if there are only finitely many exceptions, N(ω) is finite. Therefore, again, ℙ(N &lt; ∞) = 1.

Yes, that seems to confirm the conclusion.

Alternatively, suppose we model a simple case where each Xₙ is c with probability 1 - pₙ and some other integer with probability pₙ. If ∑ pₙ &lt; ∞, then by Borel-Cantelli, almost surely only finitely many Xₙ are not c, so N is finite a.s. But even if ∑ pₙ is not finite, but Xₙ → c a.s., then even though infinitely many Xₙ may be different from c with positive probability, the definition of a.s. convergence would require that lim Xₙ = c, which in integers requires that Xₙ is eventually c. So even if there are infinitely many n with Xₙ ≠ c, the limit existing and being c would force that beyond some N(ω), all Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is finite.

Wait, another angle: almost sure convergence is equivalent to ℙ(lim supₙ→∞ |Xₙ - c| ≥ ε) = 0 for all ε &gt; 0. For integer-valued variables, take ε = 1/2. Then |Xₙ - c| ≥ 1/2 is equivalent to Xₙ ≠ c. Therefore, ℙ(lim supₙ→∞ {Xₙ ≠ c}) = 0. But lim sup {Xₙ ≠ c} is the event that Xₙ ≠ c infinitely often. So ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, if the events {Xₙ ≠ c} are such that their probabilities are summable, then ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0. But here we don&#x27;t know if the probabilities are summable, we only know that the lim sup has probability zero. However, in general, if ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0, that is equivalent to Xₙ → c almost surely. Then, this implies that almost surely, only finitely many Xₙ differ from c. Hence, there exists some N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is the last time that Xₙ(ω) ≠ c, plus one. So if there are only finitely many exceptions, N(ω) is finite. Therefore, again, ℙ(N &lt; ∞) = 1.

Yes, that seems to confirm the conclusion.

Alternatively, suppose we model a simple case where each Xₙ is c with probability 1 - pₙ and some other integer with probability pₙ. If ∑ pₙ &lt; ∞, then by Borel-Cantelli, almost surely only finitely many Xₙ are not c, so N is finite a.s. But even if ∑ pₙ is not finite, but Xₙ → c a.s., then even though infinitely many Xₙ may be different from c with positive probability, the definition of a.s. convergence would require that lim Xₙ = c, which in integers requires that Xₙ is eventually c. So even if there are infinitely many n with Xₙ ≠ c, the limit existing and being c would force that beyond some N(ω), all Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is finite.

Wait, but in that case, how can you have infinitely many Xₙ ≠ c but still have Xₙ → c? In integers, you can&#x27;t. If Xₙ is equal to c for all sufficiently large n, then the limit is c. If not, there are infinitely many n with Xₙ ≠ c, which in integers means |Xₙ - c| ≥ 1, so the limit would not exist or not be c. Therefore, convergence in the integers to c a.s. implies that the sequence is eventually constant c. Therefore, N(ω) is the last time it differs from c, which is finite.

Hence, in conclusion, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

Given a sequence of integer-valued random variables \( \{ X_{n}(\omega) \} \) on a probability space \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})\) such that \( X_{n} \overset{a.s.}{\to} c \), where \( c \) is an integer constant, we need to determine if \( \mathbb{P}[N &lt; \infty] = 1 \) for \( N(\omega) = \min \{ n_{2} \geq 1 : X_{n}(\omega) = c, \forall n &gt; n_{2} \} \).

1. **Almost Sure Convergence**: By definition, \( X_{n} \overset{a.s.}{\to} c \) means there exists a set \( A \subseteq \Omega \) with \( \mathbb{P}(A) = 1 \) such that for every \( \omega \in A \), \( \lim_{n \to \infty} X_{n}(\omega) = c \).

2. **Convergence in Integer-Valued Sequences**: For integer-valued random variables, convergence to an integer \( c \) implies that the sequence must eventually be equal to \( c \). This is because the distance between any integer different from \( c \) and \( c \) is at least 1. Hence, if \( X_{n}(\omega) \) converges to \( c \), there must exist some \( N(\omega) \) such that for all \( n \geq N(\omega) \), \( X_{n}(\omega) = c \).

3. **Implications for \( N(\omega) \)**: For each \( \omega \in A \), \( N(\omega) \) is the smallest integer such that \( X_{n}(\omega) = c \) for all \( n &gt; N(\omega) \). Since \( \mathbb{P}(A) = 1 \), it follows that \( N(\omega) \) is finite for almost every \( \omega \).

4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}[N &lt; \infty] = 1 \) because the set where \( N(\omega) \) is infinite is a subset of the complement of \( A \), which has measure zero.

Problem: Consider a sequence of integer-valued random variables \( \{ X_{n}(\omega)\} \) on a probability space \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})\) such that \( X_{n}\overset{a.s.}{\to} c \), where \( c \) is an integer constant.

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Why is this true? It&#x27;s true because every random variable is almost surely equal to some finite number (the value of that random variable). In other words, for pretty much any random variable, we always get infinity! So every subsequence will contain a term equal to a constant, and by definition, \( N \) is the index of the first index such that all terms are the same constant. Since \( X \) is almost surely equal to a constant (it&#x27;s the constant, technically, but we&#x27;ll ignore that little caveat here), the probability that \( N \) is less than infinity is total probability. \( \boxed{1} \)          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about almost sure convergence of integer-valued random variables to a constant integer and whether the random variable N, defined as the minimum n₂ such that from that point onward all Xₙ are equal to c, is almost surely finite. So, we need to determine if ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

First, let me recall what almost sure convergence means. Xₙ converges almost surely to c if the probability that Xₙ approaches c as n goes to infinity is 1. Formally, ℙ[ω ∈ Ω : limₙ→∞ Xₙ(ω) = c] = 1. This means that for almost every ω (except possibly a set of measure zero), the sequence Xₙ(ω) will eventually equal c and stay there forever. Wait, actually, does almost sure convergence necessarily mean that the sequence will eventually equal c and stay there, or just that it gets arbitrarily close?

But here, the random variables are integer-valued. So c is an integer, and each Xₙ takes integer values. So if Xₙ converges to c almost surely, then for almost every ω, there exists some N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Because in the integers, to converge to c, you have to be eventually equal to c. Because otherwise, if the sequence doesn&#x27;t eventually become c, there would be some ε &gt; 0 such that infinitely many Xₙ are at least ε away from c. But since we&#x27;re dealing with integers, the distance between c and any other integer is at least 1. So if Xₙ(ω) doesn&#x27;t eventually stay at c, then there are infinitely many n where |Xₙ(ω) - c| ≥ 1, which would contradict convergence to c. Therefore, almost sure convergence in this context implies that for almost every ω, Xₙ(ω) is eventually equal to c.

Therefore, the definition of N(ω) as the minimal n₂ such that for all n &gt; n₂, Xₙ(ω) = c, should be almost surely finite. Because for almost every ω, such an n₂ exists. Therefore, N(ω) is finite almost surely. Hence, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] should be 1.

Wait, but let me check if this reasoning is correct. Let me formalize it a bit.

Suppose Xₙ → c almost surely. Then, by definition, the set A = {ω ∈ Ω : limₙ→∞ Xₙ(ω) = c} has ℙ(A) = 1. For any ω ∈ A, since the limit is c, and Xₙ(ω) are integers, then there exists N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Because if not, then there would be infinitely many n with Xₙ(ω) ≠ c, but since the variables are integer-valued, |Xₙ(ω) - c| ≥ 1 for those n, contradicting the convergence to c. Therefore, for every ω in A, N(ω) is finite. Since ℙ(A) = 1, it follows that ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose someone argues that convergence almost surely allows for some ω where convergence doesn&#x27;t hold, but those ω have probability zero. So N(ω) is finite for all ω in A, which has probability 1, hence N is almost surely finite.

But perhaps I should be careful here. Let&#x27;s write it more formally.

Given Xₙ → c a.s., which means that there exists a set B ∈ F with ℙ(B) = 1 such that for all ω ∈ B, limₙ→∞ Xₙ(ω) = c. For each ω ∈ B, since Xₙ(ω) converges to c and takes integer values, there exists an integer N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is finite for all ω ∈ B, which has probability 1. Therefore, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] ≥ ℙ(B) = 1, so ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

Therefore, yes, it is true that ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

But let me check with an example. Suppose we have a sequence where Xₙ = c for all n ≥ some random time N, and before that, Xₙ can be different. If N is finite almost surely, then yes. But here, the question is whether the almost sure convergence implies that such an N exists almost surely.

Therefore, ℙ(lim supₙ→∞ {Xₙ ≠ c}) = 0. But lim sup {Xₙ ≠ c} is the event that Xₙ ≠ c infinitely often. So ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, if the events {Xₙ ≠ c} are such that their probabilities are summable, then ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0. But here we don&#x27;t know if the probabilities are summable, we only know that the lim sup has probability zero. However, in general, if ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0, that is equivalent to Xₙ → c almost surely. Then, this implies that almost surely, only finitely many Xₙ differ from c. Hence, there exists some N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is the last time that Xₙ(ω) ≠ c, plus one. So if there are only finitely many exceptions, N(ω) is finite. Therefore, again, ℙ(N &lt; ∞) = 1.

Yes, that seems to confirm the conclusion.

If ∑ pₙ &lt; ∞, then by Borel-Cantelli, almost surely only finitely many Xₙ are not c, so N is finite a.s. But even if ∑ pₙ is not finite, but Xₙ → c a.s., then even though infinitely many Xₙ may be different from c with positive probability, the definition of a.s. convergence would require that lim Xₙ = c, which in integers requires that Xₙ is eventually c. So even if there are infinitely many n with Xₙ ≠ c, the limit existing and being c would force that beyond some N(ω), all Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is finite.

Because if not, then there would be infinitely many n with Xₙ(ω) ≠ c, but since the variables are integer-valued, |Xₙ(ω) - c| ≥ 1 for those n, contradicting the convergence to c. Therefore, for every ω in A, N(ω) is finite. Since ℙ(A) = 1, it follows that ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose someone argues that convergence almost surely allows for some ω where convergence doesn&#x27;t hold, but those ω have probability zero. So N(ω) is finite for all ω in A, which has probability 1, hence N is almost surely finite.

But perhaps I should be careful here. Let&#x27;s write it more formally.

Given Xₙ → c a.s., which means that there exists a set B ∈ F with ℙ(B) = 1 such that for all ω ∈ B, limₙ→∞ Xₙ(ω) = c. For each ω ∈ B, since Xₙ(ω) converges to c and takes integer values, there exists an integer N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is finite for all ω ∈ B, which has probability 1. Therefore, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] ≥ ℙ(B) = 1, so ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

Therefore, yes, it is true that ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

But let me check with an example. Suppose we have a sequence where Xₙ = c for all n ≥ some random time N, and before that, Xₙ can be different. If N is finite almost surely, then yes. But here, the question is whether the almost sure convergence implies that such an N exists almost surely.

Wait, another angle: almost sure convergence is equivalent to ℙ(lim supₙ→∞ |Xₙ - c| ≥ ε) = 0 for all ε &gt; 0. For integer-valued variables, take ε = 1/2. Then |Xₙ - c| ≥ 1/2 is equivalent to Xₙ ≠ c. Therefore, ℙ(lim supₙ→∞ {Xₙ ≠ c}) = 0. But lim sup {Xₙ ≠ c} is the event that Xₙ ≠ c infinitely often. So ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, if the events {Xₙ ≠ c} are such that their probabilities are summable, then ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0. But here we don&#x27;t know if the probabilities are summable, we only know that the lim sup has probability zero. However, in general, if ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0, that is equivalent to Xₙ → c almost surely. Then, this implies that almost surely, only finitely many Xₙ differ from c. Hence, there exists some N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is the last time that Xₙ(ω) ≠ c, plus one. So if there are only finitely many exceptions, N(ω) is finite. Therefore, again, ℙ(N &lt; ∞) = 1.

Yes, that seems to confirm the conclusion.

Alternatively, suppose we model a simple case where each Xₙ is c with probability 1 - pₙ and some other integer with probability pₙ. If ∑ pₙ &lt; ∞, then by Borel-Cantelli, almost surely only finitely many Xₙ are not c, so N is finite a.s. But even if ∑ pₙ is not finite, but Xₙ → c a.s., then even though infinitely many Xₙ may be different from c with positive probability, the definition of a.s. convergence would require that lim Xₙ = c, which in integers requires that Xₙ is eventually c. So even if there are infinitely many n with Xₙ ≠ c, the limit existing and being c would force that beyond some N(ω), all Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is finite.

Wait, but in that case, how can you have infinitely many Xₙ ≠ c but still have Xₙ → c? In integers, you can&#x27;t. If Xₙ is equal to c for all sufficiently large n, then the limit is c. If not, there are infinitely many n with Xₙ ≠ c, which in integers means |Xₙ - c| ≥ 1, so the limit would not exist or not be c. Therefore, convergence in the integers to c a.s. implies that the sequence is eventually constant c. Therefore, N(ω) is the last time it differs from c, which is finite.

Hence, in conclusion, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}

Given a sequence of integer-valued random variables \( \{ X_{n}(\omega) \} \) on a probability space \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})\) such that \( X_{n} \overset{a.s.}{\to} c \), where \( c \) is an integer constant, we need to determine if \( \mathbb{P}[N &lt; \infty] = 1 \) for \( N(\omega) = \min \{ n_{2} \geq 1 : X_{n}(\omega) = c, \forall n &gt; n_{2} \} \).

1. **Almost Sure Convergence**: By definition, \( X_{n} \overset{a.s.}{\to} c \) means there exists a set \( A \subseteq \Omega \) with \( \mathbb{P}(A) = 1 \) such that for every \( \omega \in A \), \( \lim_{n \to \infty} X_{n}(\omega) = c \).

2. **Convergence in Integer-Valued Sequences**: For integer-valued random variables, convergence to an integer \( c \) implies that the sequence must eventually be equal to \( c \). This is because the distance between any integer different from \( c \) and \( c \) is at least 1. Hence, if \( X_{n}(\omega) \) converges to \( c \), there must exist some \( N(\omega) \) such that for all \( n \geq N(\omega) \), \( X_{n}(\omega) = c \).

3. **Implications for \( N(\omega) \)**: For each \( \omega \in A \), \( N(\omega) \) is the smallest integer such that \( X_{n}(\omega) = c \) for all \( n &gt; N(\omega) \). Since \( \mathbb{P}(A) = 1 \), it follows that \( N(\omega) \) is finite for almost every \( \omega \).

4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}[N &lt; \infty] = 1 \) because the set where \( N(\omega) \) is infinite is a subset of the complement of \( A \), which has measure zero.

Reference Answer: Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The question is about almost sure convergence of integer-valued random variables to a constant integer and whether the random variable N, defined as the minimum n₂ such that from that point onward all Xₙ are equal to c, is almost surely finite. So, we need to determine if ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

First, let me recall what almost sure convergence means. Xₙ converges almost surely to c if the probability that Xₙ approaches c as n goes to infinity is 1. Formally, ℙ[ω ∈ Ω : limₙ→∞ Xₙ(ω) = c] = 1. This means that for almost every ω (except possibly a set of measure zero), the sequence Xₙ(ω) will eventually equal c and stay there forever. Wait, actually, does almost sure convergence necessarily mean that the sequence will eventually equal c and stay there, or just that it gets arbitrarily close?

But here, the random variables are integer-valued. So c is an integer, and each Xₙ takes integer values. So if Xₙ converges to c almost surely, then for almost every ω, there exists some N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Because in the integers, to converge to c, you have to be eventually equal to c. Because otherwise, if the sequence doesn&#x27;t eventually become c, there would be some ε &gt; 0 such that infinitely many Xₙ are at least ε away from c. But since we&#x27;re dealing with integers, the distance between c and any other integer is at least 1. So if Xₙ(ω) doesn&#x27;t eventually stay at c, then there are infinitely many n where |Xₙ(ω) - c| ≥ 1, which would contradict convergence to c. Therefore, almost sure convergence in this context implies that for almost every ω, Xₙ(ω) is eventually equal to c.

Therefore, the definition of N(ω) as the minimal n₂ such that for all n &gt; n₂, Xₙ(ω) = c, should be almost surely finite. Because for almost every ω, such an n₂ exists. Therefore, N(ω) is finite almost surely. Hence, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] should be 1.

Wait, but let me check if this reasoning is correct. Let me formalize it a bit.

Suppose Xₙ → c almost surely. Then, by definition, the set A = {ω ∈ Ω : limₙ→∞ Xₙ(ω) = c} has ℙ(A) = 1. For any ω ∈ A, since the limit is c, and Xₙ(ω) are integers, then there exists N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Because if not, then there would be infinitely many n with Xₙ(ω) ≠ c, but since the variables are integer-valued, |Xₙ(ω) - c| ≥ 1 for those n, contradicting the convergence to c. Therefore, for every ω in A, N(ω) is finite. Since ℙ(A) = 1, it follows that ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose someone argues that convergence almost surely allows for some ω where convergence doesn&#x27;t hold, but those ω have probability zero. So N(ω) is finite for all ω in A, which has probability 1, hence N is almost surely finite.

But perhaps I should be careful here. Let&#x27;s write it more formally.

Given Xₙ → c a.s., which means that there exists a set B ∈ F with ℙ(B) = 1 such that for all ω ∈ B, limₙ→∞ Xₙ(ω) = c. For each ω ∈ B, since Xₙ(ω) converges to c and takes integer values, there exists an integer N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is finite for all ω ∈ B, which has probability 1. Therefore, ℙ[N &lt; ∞] ≥ ℙ(B) = 1, so ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

Therefore, yes, it is true that ℙ[N &lt; ∞] = 1.

But let me check with an example. Suppose we have a sequence where Xₙ = c for all n ≥ some random time N, and before that, Xₙ can be different. If N is finite almost surely, then yes. But here, the question is whether the almost sure convergence implies that such an N exists almost surely.

Therefore, ℙ(lim supₙ→∞ {Xₙ ≠ c}) = 0. But lim sup {Xₙ ≠ c} is the event that Xₙ ≠ c infinitely often. So ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, if the events {Xₙ ≠ c} are such that their probabilities are summable, then ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0. But here we don&#x27;t know if the probabilities are summable, we only know that the lim sup has probability zero. However, in general, if ℙ(Xₙ ≠ c i.o.) = 0, that is equivalent to Xₙ → c almost surely. Then, this implies that almost surely, only finitely many Xₙ differ from c. Hence, there exists some N(ω) such that for all n ≥ N(ω), Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is the last time that Xₙ(ω) ≠ c, plus one. So if there are only finitely many exceptions, N(ω) is finite. Therefore, again, ℙ(N &lt; ∞) = 1.

Yes, that seems to confirm the conclusion.

Alternatively, suppose we model a simple case where each Xₙ is c with probability 1 - pₙ and some other integer with probability pₙ. If ∑ pₙ &lt; ∞, then by Borel-Cantelli, almost surely only finitely many Xₙ are not c, so N is finite a.s. But even if ∑ pₙ is not finite, but Xₙ → c a.s., then even though infinitely many Xₙ may be different from c with positive probability, the definition of a.s. convergence would require that lim Xₙ = c, which in integers requires that Xₙ is eventually c. So even if there are infinitely many n with Xₙ ≠ c, the limit existing and being c would force that beyond some N(ω), all Xₙ(ω) = c. Therefore, N(ω) is finite.
