Problem: Determine whether the torsion is zero for an osculating curve in Euclidean space. A curve is called an osculating curve if its position vector lies on its osculating plane. The osculating plane for the curve \( \alpha(s) \) at some point is generated by the tangent vector and normal vector of \( \alpha \) at that point, i.e., \( \alpha(s)=\lambda_1(s)t(s)+\lambda_2(s)n(s) \) for some functions \( \lambda_1(s) \) and \( \lambda_2(s) \). Is the torsion zero for such a curve? Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Let \( \alpha(s) \) be a non-trivial osculating curve on the Euclidean space. We know that 
\[ T(s) = \lambda_1(s) t(s)+\lambda_2(s) \]
where \( t(s) \) is the tangent vector of \( \alpha \) and \( n(s) \) is its normal vector.

Rearranging this equation, we get \[ \alpha(s)= \lambda_1(s)t(s)
+\lambda_2(s)n(s)+\alpha(s)&#x27;
\]
Since this is an osculating curve, by definition it means \( \alpha(s)= \lambda_1(s)t(s)
+\lambda_2(s)n(s) \), so \alpha(s)&#x27;
= 0. Since this is true for any \( s \), we have \[v(s)=\lambda_2(s
t(s)-n(s))=0 \] for all \( s \), so \( v(s)=\lambda_1(s)=0
\). Therefore, only \( \lambda_2(s) \) is nonzero, so \( T(s) = \lambda_1(s)d_z
+ 0\cdot d_x + 0\cdot d_y \). \boxed{No}          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the torsion is zero for an osculating curve in Euclidean space. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts. An osculating curve is defined as a curve whose position vector lies entirely within its osculating plane. The osculating plane at a point on a curve is the plane spanned by the tangent vector and the normal vector. So, for such a curve, we can write the position vector α(s) as a linear combination of the tangent vector t(s) and the normal vector n(s), right? That is, α(s) = λ₁(s)t(s) + λ₂(s)n(s) for some scalar functions λ₁ and λ₂.

Now, the question is about torsion. Torsion τ measures how much the curve twists out of the osculating plane. If the torsion is zero, the curve lies entirely within a fixed plane, making it a plane curve. So, intuitively, if the position vector is always in the osculating plane, maybe the curve doesn&#x27;t twist out of that plane, implying zero torsion. But I need to verify this mathematically.

Let me recall the Frenet-Serret formulas for a curve parameterized by arc length s:

t&#x27;(s) = κ(s)n(s)
n&#x27;(s) = -κ(s)t(s) + τ(s)b(s)
b&#x27;(s) = -τ(s)n(s)

Here, t is the tangent vector, n is the normal vector, b is the binormal vector, κ is the curvature, and τ is the torsion.

Since the position vector α(s) lies in the osculating plane, it can be expressed as α(s) = λ₁(s)t(s) + λ₂(s)n(s). Let me differentiate this expression with respect to s to see if I can derive relations involving κ and τ.

First, compute α&#x27;(s). Since α is parameterized by arc length, α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Differentiating the given expression:

α&#x27;(s) = d/ds [λ₁ t + λ₂ n]
= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ t&#x27; + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ n&#x27;

Using the Frenet-Serret formulas, substitute t&#x27; = κ n and n&#x27; = -κ t + τ b:

= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ (κ n) + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ (-κ t + τ b)
= (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) t + (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) n + (λ₂ τ) b

But we know that α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Therefore, equating components:

1. The coefficient of t: (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) = 1
2. The coefficient of n: (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) = 0
3. The coefficient of b: λ₂ τ = 0

So, from the third equation, we have λ₂ τ = 0. This equation must hold for all s. If λ₂ is not identically zero, then τ must be zero. However, if λ₂ is zero everywhere, then from the second equation, λ₁ κ = 0. If κ is not zero (since we are dealing with a curve with an osculating plane, curvature can&#x27;t be zero?), then λ₁ must be zero. But then from the first equation, 0 - 0 = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, λ₂ cannot be identically zero.

Therefore, since λ₂ is not identically zero, from λ₂ τ = 0, it follows that τ must be identically zero. Hence, the torsion is zero for an osculating curve.

Wait, let me check this again. Suppose λ₂ is not zero at some point, then τ must be zero at that point. But since we have to hold for all s, unless λ₂ is zero everywhere, which we saw leads to a contradiction, τ must be zero everywhere. Therefore, the torsion is zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a case where λ₂ is zero at some points but not others. For example, if λ₂ is zero in some intervals and non-zero in others. But then in the intervals where λ₂ is non-zero, τ would have to be zero. However, torsion is a smooth function, so if τ is zero on an interval, and the curve is analytic, it would be zero everywhere. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify analyticity, so torsion could be zero on some parts and non-zero on others where λ₂ is zero. However, in the regions where λ₂ is zero, from the second equation, λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27; = 0. If λ₂ is zero in an interval, then λ₂&#x27; is also zero there, so λ₁ κ = 0. If κ ≠ 0, then λ₁ = 0. Then from the first equation, λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂ = 0 - 0 = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, even if λ₂ is zero in an interval, we get a contradiction, so λ₂ cannot be zero in any interval. Therefore, τ must be zero everywhere.

Therefore, the torsion τ is zero for an osculating curve.

Wait, but let me think of an example. A plane curve has τ = 0, and its position vector lies in the plane, which is the osculating plane. So, yes, plane curves are osculating curves with τ = 0. But are there non-plane curves (with τ ≠ 0) that are osculating curves? According to the above reasoning, no. Because if the position vector lies in the osculating plane everywhere, then τ must be zero.

Alternatively, maybe a circular helix? But the position vector of a helix doesn&#x27;t lie in the osculating plane. Let me check. The osculating plane of a helix is the plane spanned by t and n. The position vector for a helix is (a cos t, a sin t, bt). The tangent vector t is (-a sin t, a cos t, b)/sqrt(a² + b²), and the normal vector n is (-cos t, -sin t, 0). So, the osculating plane is spanned by t and n. The position vector would have components in the t, n, and b directions? Maybe not lying entirely in the osculating plane. So probably, helices are not osculating curves.

Therefore, the conclusion is that torsion must be zero. Therefore, the answer is yes, the torsion is zero for such a curve.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the torsion is zero for an osculating curve in Euclidean space, we start by noting that an osculating curve has its position vector lying in the osculating plane. This means the position vector \(\alpha(s)\) can be expressed as \(\alpha(s) = \lambda_1(s)t(s) + \lambda_2(s)n(s)\) for some scalar functions \(\lambda_1(s)\) and \(\lambda_2(s)\).

Using the Frenet-Serret formulas for a curve parameterized by arc length \(s\):
\[
\begin{aligned}
t&#x27;(s) &amp;= \kappa(s)n(s), \\
n&#x27;(s) &amp;= -\kappa(s)t(s) + \tau(s)b(s), \\
b&#x27;(s) &amp;= -\tau(s)n(s),
\end{aligned}
\]
we differentiate the position vector \(\alpha(s)\):
\[
\alpha&#x27;(s) = \frac{d}{ds}[\lambda_1 t + \lambda_2 n] = \lambda_1&#x27; t + \lambda_1 t&#x27; + \lambda_2&#x27; n + \lambda_2 n&#x27;.
\]
Substituting \(t&#x27; = \kappa n\) and \(n&#x27; = -\kappa t + \tau b\), we get:
\[
\alpha&#x27;(s) = (\lambda_1&#x27; - \kappa \lambda_2) t + (\lambda_1 \kappa + \lambda_2&#x27;) n + (\lambda_2 \tau) b.
\]
Since \(\alpha&#x27;(s) = t(s)\), equating the components of the tangent, normal, and binormal vectors gives:
\[
\begin{aligned}
1. &amp;\quad \lambda_1&#x27; - \kappa \lambda_2 = 1, \\
2. &amp;\quad \lambda_1 \kappa + \lambda_2&#x27; = 0, \\
3. &amp;\quad \lambda_2 \tau = 0.
\end{aligned}
\]
From the third equation, \(\lambda_2 \tau = 0\). If \(\lambda_2 \neq 0\), then \(\tau = 0\). If \(\lambda_2 = 0\) in some interval, the second equation implies \(\lambda_1 \kappa = 0\). If \(\kappa \neq 0\), then \(\lambda_1 = 0\), leading to a contradiction in the first equation. Thus, \(\lambda_2\) cannot be zero in any interval, implying \(\tau = 0\) everywhere.

Therefore, the torsion \(\tau\) must be zero for an osculating curve.

t&#x27;(s) = κ(s)n(s)
n&#x27;(s) = -κ(s)t(s) + τ(s)b(s)
b&#x27;(s) = -τ(s)n(s)

Here, t is the tangent vector, n is the normal vector, b is the binormal vector, κ is the curvature, and τ is the torsion.

Since the position vector α(s) lies in the osculating plane, it can be expressed as α(s) = λ₁(s)t(s) + λ₂(s)n(s). Let me differentiate this expression with respect to s to see if I can derive relations involving κ and τ.

First, compute α&#x27;(s). Since α is parameterized by arc length, α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Differentiating the given expression:

α&#x27;(s) = d/ds [λ₁ t + λ₂ n]
= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ t&#x27; + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ n&#x27;

Using the Frenet-Serret formulas, substitute t&#x27; = κ n and n&#x27; = -κ t + τ b:

= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ (κ n) + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ (-κ t + τ b)
= (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) t + (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) n + (λ₂ τ) b

But we know that α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Therefore, equating components:

1. The coefficient of t: (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) = 1
2. The coefficient of n: (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) = 0
3. The coefficient of b: λ₂ τ = 0

So, from the third equation, we have λ₂ τ = 0. This equation must hold for all s. If λ₂ is not identically zero, then τ must be zero. However, if λ₂ is zero everywhere, then from the second equation, λ₁ κ = 0. If κ is not zero (since we are dealing with a curve with an osculating plane, curvature can&#x27;t be zero?), then λ₁ must be zero. But then from the first equation, 0 - 0 = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, λ₂ cannot be identically zero.

Therefore, since λ₂ is not identically zero, from λ₂ τ = 0, it follows that τ must be identically zero. Hence, the torsion is zero for an osculating curve.

This means the position vector \(\alpha(s)\) can be expressed as \(\alpha(s) = \lambda_1(s)t(s) + \lambda_2(s)n(s)\) for some scalar functions \(\lambda_1(s)\) and \(\lambda_2(s)\).

Using the Frenet-Serret formulas for a curve parameterized by arc length \(s\):
\[
\begin{aligned}
t&#x27;(s) &amp;= \kappa(s)n(s), \\
n&#x27;(s) &amp;= -\kappa(s)t(s) + \tau(s)b(s), \\
b&#x27;(s) &amp;= -\tau(s)n(s),
\end{aligned}
\]
we differentiate the position vector \(\alpha(s)\):
\[
\alpha&#x27;(s) = \frac{d}{ds}[\lambda_1 t + \lambda_2 n] = \lambda_1&#x27; t + \lambda_1 t&#x27; + \lambda_2&#x27; n + \lambda_2 n&#x27;.
\]
Substituting \(t&#x27; = \kappa n\) and \(n&#x27; = -\kappa t + \tau b\), we get:
\[
\alpha&#x27;(s) = (\lambda_1&#x27; - \kappa \lambda_2) t + (\lambda_1 \kappa + \lambda_2&#x27;) n + (\lambda_2 \tau) b.
\]
Since \(\alpha&#x27;(s) = t(s)\), equating the components of the tangent, normal, and binormal vectors gives:
\[
\begin{aligned}
1. &amp;\quad \lambda_1&#x27; - \kappa \lambda_2 = 1, \\
2. &amp;\quad \lambda_1 \kappa + \lambda_2&#x27; = 0, \\
3. &amp;\quad \lambda_2 \tau = 0.
\end{aligned}
\]
From the third equation, \(\lambda_2 \tau = 0\). If \(\lambda_2 \neq 0\), then \(\tau = 0\). If \(\lambda_2 = 0\) in some interval, the second equation implies \(\lambda_1 \kappa = 0\). If \(\kappa \neq 0\), then \(\lambda_1 = 0\), leading to a contradiction in the first equation. Thus, \(\lambda_2\) cannot be zero in any interval, implying \(\tau = 0\) everywhere.

Therefore, the torsion \(\tau\) must be zero for an osculating curve.

Here, t is the tangent vector, n is the normal vector, b is the binormal vector, κ is the curvature, and τ is the torsion.

Since the position vector α(s) lies in the osculating plane, it can be expressed as α(s) = λ₁(s)t(s) + λ₂(s)n(s). Let me differentiate this expression with respect to s to see if I can derive relations involving κ and τ.

First, compute α&#x27;(s). Since α is parameterized by arc length, α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Differentiating the given expression:

α&#x27;(s) = d/ds [λ₁ t + λ₂ n]
= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ t&#x27; + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ n&#x27;

Using the Frenet-Serret formulas, substitute t&#x27; = κ n and n&#x27; = -κ t + τ b:

= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ (κ n) + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ (-κ t + τ b)
= (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) t + (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) n + (λ₂ τ) b

But we know that α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Therefore, equating components:

1. The coefficient of t: (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) = 1
2. The coefficient of n: (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) = 0
3. The coefficient of b: λ₂ τ = 0

So, from the third equation, we have λ₂ τ = 0. This equation must hold for all s. If λ₂ is not identically zero, then τ must be zero. However, if λ₂ is zero everywhere, then from the second equation, λ₁ κ = 0. If κ is not zero (since we are dealing with a curve with an osculating plane, curvature can&#x27;t be zero?), then λ₁ must be zero. But then from the first equation, 0 - 0 = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, λ₂ cannot be identically zero.

Therefore, since λ₂ is not identically zero, from λ₂ τ = 0, it follows that τ must be identically zero. Hence, the torsion is zero for an osculating curve.

Wait, let me check this again. Suppose λ₂ is not zero at some point, then τ must be zero at that point. But since we have to hold for all s, unless λ₂ is zero everywhere, which we saw leads to a contradiction, τ must be zero everywhere. Therefore, the torsion is zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a case where λ₂ is zero at some points but not others. For example, if λ₂ is zero in some intervals and non-zero in others. But then in the intervals where λ₂ is non-zero, τ would have to be zero. However, torsion is a smooth function, so if τ is zero on an interval, and the curve is analytic, it would be zero everywhere. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify analyticity, so torsion could be zero on some parts and non-zero on others where λ₂ is zero. However, in the regions where λ₂ is zero, from the second equation, λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27; = 0. If λ₂ is zero in an interval, then λ₂&#x27; is also zero there, so λ₁ κ = 0. If κ ≠ 0, then λ₁ = 0. Then from the first equation, λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂ = 0 - 0 = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, even if λ₂ is zero in an interval, we get a contradiction, so λ₂ cannot be zero in any interval. Therefore, τ must be zero everywhere.

Therefore, the torsion τ is zero for an osculating curve.

Wait, but let me think of an example. A plane curve has τ = 0, and its position vector lies in the plane, which is the osculating plane. So, yes, plane curves are osculating curves with τ = 0. But are there non-plane curves (with τ ≠ 0) that are osculating curves? According to the above reasoning, no. Because if the position vector lies in the osculating plane everywhere, then τ must be zero.

Alternatively, maybe a circular helix? But the position vector of a helix doesn&#x27;t lie in the osculating plane. Let me check. The osculating plane of a helix is the plane spanned by t and n. The position vector for a helix is (a cos t, a sin t, bt). The tangent vector t is (-a sin t, a cos t, b)/sqrt(a² + b²), and the normal vector n is (-cos t, -sin t, 0). So, the osculating plane is spanned by t and n. The position vector would have components in the t, n, and b directions? Maybe not lying entirely in the osculating plane. So probably, helices are not osculating curves.

Therefore, the conclusion is that torsion must be zero. Therefore, the answer is yes, the torsion is zero for such a curve.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the torsion is zero for an osculating curve in Euclidean space, we start by noting that an osculating curve has its position vector lying in the osculating plane. This means the position vector \(\alpha(s)\) can be expressed as \(\alpha(s) = \lambda_1(s)t(s) + \lambda_2(s)n(s)\) for some scalar functions \(\lambda_1(s)\) and \(\lambda_2(s)\).

Using the Frenet-Serret formulas for a curve parameterized by arc length \(s\):
\[
\begin{aligned}
t&#x27;(s) &amp;= \kappa(s)n(s), \\
n&#x27;(s) &amp;= -\kappa(s)t(s) + \tau(s)b(s), \\
b&#x27;(s) &amp;= -\tau(s)n(s),
\end{aligned}
\]
we differentiate the position vector \(\alpha(s)\):
\[
\alpha&#x27;(s) = \frac{d}{ds}[\lambda_1 t + \lambda_2 n] = \lambda_1&#x27; t + \lambda_1 t&#x27; + \lambda_2&#x27; n + \lambda_2 n&#x27;.
\]
Substituting \(t&#x27; = \kappa n\) and \(n&#x27; = -\kappa t + \tau b\), we get:
\[
\alpha&#x27;(s) = (\lambda_1&#x27; - \kappa \lambda_2) t + (\lambda_1 \kappa + \lambda_2&#x27;) n + (\lambda_2 \tau) b.
\]
Since \(\alpha&#x27;(s) = t(s)\), equating the components of the tangent, normal, and binormal vectors gives:
\[
\begin{aligned}
1. &amp;\quad \lambda_1&#x27; - \kappa \lambda_2 = 1, \\
2. &amp;\quad \lambda_1 \kappa + \lambda_2&#x27; = 0, \\
3. &amp;\quad \lambda_2 \tau = 0.
\end{aligned}
\]
From the third equation, \(\lambda_2 \tau = 0\). If \(\lambda_2 \neq 0\), then \(\tau = 0\). If \(\lambda_2 = 0\) in some interval, the second equation implies \(\lambda_1 \kappa = 0\). If \(\kappa \neq 0\), then \(\lambda_1 = 0\), leading to a contradiction in the first equation. Thus, \(\lambda_2\) cannot be zero in any interval, implying \(\tau = 0\) everywhere.

Therefore, the torsion \(\tau\) must be zero for an osculating curve.

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the torsion is zero for an osculating curve in Euclidean space. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts. An osculating curve is defined as a curve whose position vector lies entirely within its osculating plane. The osculating plane at a point on a curve is the plane spanned by the tangent vector and the normal vector. So, for such a curve, we can write the position vector α(s) as a linear combination of the tangent vector t(s) and the normal vector n(s), right? That is, α(s) = λ₁(s)t(s) + λ₂(s)n(s) for some scalar functions λ₁ and λ₂.

Now, the question is about torsion. Torsion τ measures how much the curve twists out of the osculating plane. If the torsion is zero, the curve lies entirely within a fixed plane, making it a plane curve. So, intuitively, if the position vector is always in the osculating plane, maybe the curve doesn&#x27;t twist out of that plane, implying zero torsion. But I need to verify this mathematically.

Let me recall the Frenet-Serret formulas for a curve parameterized by arc length s:

t&#x27;(s) = κ(s)n(s)
n&#x27;(s) = -κ(s)t(s) + τ(s)b(s)
b&#x27;(s) = -τ(s)n(s)

Here, t is the tangent vector, n is the normal vector, b is the binormal vector, κ is the curvature, and τ is the torsion.

Since the position vector α(s) lies in the osculating plane, it can be expressed as α(s) = λ₁(s)t(s) + λ₂(s)n(s). Let me differentiate this expression with respect to s to see if I can derive relations involving κ and τ.

First, compute α&#x27;(s). Since α is parameterized by arc length, α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Differentiating the given expression:

α&#x27;(s) = d/ds [λ₁ t + λ₂ n]
= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ t&#x27; + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ n&#x27;

Using the Frenet-Serret formulas, substitute t&#x27; = κ n and n&#x27; = -κ t + τ b:

= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ (κ n) + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ (-κ t + τ b)
= (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) t + (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) n + (λ₂ τ) b

But we know that α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Therefore, equating components:

1. The coefficient of t: (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) = 1
2. The coefficient of n: (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) = 0
3. The coefficient of b: λ₂ τ = 0

So, from the third equation, we have λ₂ τ = 0. This equation must hold for all s. If λ₂ is not identically zero, then τ must be zero. However, if λ₂ is zero everywhere, then from the second equation, λ₁ κ = 0. If κ is not zero (since we are dealing with a curve with an osculating plane, curvature can&#x27;t be zero?), then λ₁ must be zero. But then from the first equation, 0 - 0 = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, λ₂ cannot be identically zero.

Therefore, since λ₂ is not identically zero, from λ₂ τ = 0, it follows that τ must be identically zero. Hence, the torsion is zero for an osculating curve.

Wait, let me check this again. Suppose λ₂ is not zero at some point, then τ must be zero at that point. But since we have to hold for all s, unless λ₂ is zero everywhere, which we saw leads to a contradiction, τ must be zero everywhere. Therefore, the torsion is zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a case where λ₂ is zero at some points but not others. For example, if λ₂ is zero in some intervals and non-zero in others. But then in the intervals where λ₂ is non-zero, τ would have to be zero. However, torsion is a smooth function, so if τ is zero on an interval, and the curve is analytic, it would be zero everywhere.

However, in the regions where λ₂ is zero, from the second equation, λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27; = 0. If λ₂ is zero in an interval, then λ₂&#x27; is also zero there, so λ₁ κ = 0. If κ ≠ 0, then λ₁ = 0. Then from the first equation, λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂ = 0 - 0 = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, even if λ₂ is zero in an interval, we get a contradiction, so λ₂ cannot be zero in any interval. Therefore, τ must be zero everywhere.

Therefore, the torsion τ is zero for an osculating curve.

Wait, but let me think of an example. A plane curve has τ = 0, and its position vector lies in the plane, which is the osculating plane. So, yes, plane curves are osculating curves with τ = 0. But are there non-plane curves (with τ ≠ 0) that are osculating curves? According to the above reasoning, no.

n&#x27;(s) &amp;= -\kappa(s)t(s) + \tau(s)b(s), \\
b&#x27;(s) &amp;= -\tau(s)n(s),

\]
we differentiate the position vector \(\alpha(s)\):
\[
\alpha&#x27;(s) = \frac{d}{ds}[\lambda_1 t + \lambda_2 n] = \lambda_1&#x27; t + \lambda_1 t&#x27; + \lambda_2&#x27; n + \lambda_2 n&#x27;.
\]
Substituting \(t&#x27; = \kappa n\) and \(n&#x27; = -\kappa t + \tau b\), we get:
\[
\alpha&#x27;(s) = (\lambda_1&#x27; - \kappa \lambda_2) t + (\lambda_1 \kappa + \lambda_2&#x27;) n + (\lambda_2 \tau) b.
\]
Since \(\alpha&#x27;(s) = t(s)\), equating the components of the tangent, normal, and binormal vectors gives:
\[
\begin{aligned}
1. &amp;\quad \lambda_1&#x27; - \kappa \lambda_2 = 1, \\
2. &amp;\quad \lambda_1 \kappa + \lambda_2&#x27; = 0, \\
3. &amp;\quad \lambda_2 \tau = 0.

From the third equation, \(\lambda_2 \tau = 0\). If \(\lambda_2 \neq 0\), then \(\tau = 0\). If \(\lambda_2 = 0\) in some interval, the second equation implies \(\lambda_1 \kappa = 0\).

we differentiate the position vector \(\alpha(s)\):

Response: A vector r is tangent if and only if it is aligned with the first factor r_1, and it is normal if it is perpendicular to both r_1 and r_2, i.e. it lies in the space perpendicular to r_1 and r_2.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the torsion is zero for an osculating curve in Euclidean space. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts. An osculating curve is defined as a curve whose position vector lies entirely within its osculating plane. The osculating plane at a point on a curve is the plane spanned by the tangent vector and the normal vector. So, for such a curve, we can write the position vector α(s) as a linear combination of the tangent vector t(s) and the normal vector n(s), right? That is, α(s) = λ₁(s)t(s) + λ₂(s)n(s) for some scalar functions λ₁ and λ₂.

Now, the question is about torsion. Torsion τ measures how much the curve twists out of the osculating plane. If the torsion is zero, the curve lies entirely within a fixed plane, making it a plane curve. So, intuitively, if the position vector is always in the osculating plane, maybe the curve doesn&#x27;t twist out of that plane, implying zero torsion. But I need to verify this mathematically.

Let me recall the Frenet-Serret formulas for a curve parameterized by arc length s:

t&#x27;(s) = κ(s)n(s)
n&#x27;(s) = -κ(s)t(s) + τ(s)b(s)
b&#x27;(s) = -τ(s)n(s)

Here, t is the tangent vector, n is the normal vector, b is the binormal vector, κ is the curvature, and τ is the torsion.

Since the position vector α(s) lies in the osculating plane, it can be expressed as α(s) = λ₁(s)t(s) + λ₂(s)n(s). Let me differentiate this expression with respect to s to see if I can derive relations involving κ and τ.

First, compute α&#x27;(s). Since α is parameterized by arc length, α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Differentiating the given expression:

α&#x27;(s) = d/ds [λ₁ t + λ₂ n]
= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ t&#x27; + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ n&#x27;

Using the Frenet-Serret formulas, substitute t&#x27; = κ n and n&#x27; = -κ t + τ b:

= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ (κ n) + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ (-κ t + τ b)
= (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) t + (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) n + (λ₂ τ) b

But we know that α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Therefore, equating components:

1. The coefficient of t: (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) = 1
2. The coefficient of n: (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) = 0
3. The coefficient of b: λ₂ τ = 0

So, from the third equation, we have λ₂ τ = 0. This equation must hold for all s. If λ₂ is not identically zero, then τ must be zero. However, if λ₂ is zero everywhere, then from the second equation, λ₁ κ = 0. If κ is not zero (since we are dealing with a curve with an osculating plane, curvature can&#x27;t be zero?), then λ₁ must be zero. But then from the first equation, 0 - 0 = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, λ₂ cannot be identically zero.

Therefore, since λ₂ is not identically zero, from λ₂ τ = 0, it follows that τ must be identically zero. Hence, the torsion is zero for an osculating curve.

Wait, let me check this again. Suppose λ₂ is not zero at some point, then τ must be zero at that point. But since we have to hold for all s, unless λ₂ is zero everywhere, which we saw leads to a contradiction, τ must be zero everywhere. Therefore, the torsion is zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a case where λ₂ is zero at some points but not others. For example, if λ₂ is zero in some intervals and non-zero in others. But then in the intervals where λ₂ is non-zero, τ would have to be zero. However, torsion is a smooth function, so if τ is zero on an interval, and the curve is analytic, it would be zero everywhere. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify analyticity, so torsion could be zero on some parts and non-zero on others where λ₂ is zero. However, in the regions where λ₂ is zero, from the second equation, λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27; = 0. If λ₂ is zero in an interval, then λ₂&#x27; is also zero there, so λ₁ κ = 0. If κ ≠ 0, then λ₁ = 0. Then from the first equation, λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂ = 0 - 0 = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, even if λ₂ is zero in an interval, we get a contradiction, so λ₂ cannot be zero in any interval. Therefore, τ must be zero everywhere.

Therefore, the torsion τ is zero for an osculating curve.

Wait, but let me think of an example. A plane curve has τ = 0, and its position vector lies in the plane, which is the osculating plane. So, yes, plane curves are osculating curves with τ = 0. But are there non-plane curves (with τ ≠ 0) that are osculating curves? According to the above reasoning, no. Because if the position vector lies in the osculating plane everywhere, then τ must be zero.

Alternatively, maybe a circular helix? But the position vector of a helix doesn&#x27;t lie in the osculating plane. Let me check. The osculating plane of a helix is the plane spanned by t and n. The position vector for a helix is (a cos t, a sin t, bt). The tangent vector t is (-a sin t, a cos t, b)/sqrt(a² + b²), and the normal vector n is (-cos t, -sin t, 0). So, the osculating plane is spanned by t and n. The position vector would have components in the t, n, and b directions? Maybe not lying entirely in the osculating plane. So probably, helices are not osculating curves.

Therefore, the conclusion is that torsion must be zero. Therefore, the answer is yes, the torsion is zero for such a curve.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the torsion is zero for an osculating curve in Euclidean space, we start by noting that an osculating curve has its position vector lying in the osculating plane. This means the position vector \(\alpha(s)\) can be expressed as \(\alpha(s) = \lambda_1(s)t(s) + \lambda_2(s)n(s)\) for some scalar functions \(\lambda_1(s)\) and \(\lambda_2(s)\).

Using the Frenet-Serret formulas for a curve parameterized by arc length \(s\):
\[
\begin{aligned}
t&#x27;(s) &amp;= \kappa(s)n(s), \\
n&#x27;(s) &amp;= -\kappa(s)t(s) + \tau(s)b(s), \\
b&#x27;(s) &amp;= -\tau(s)n(s),
\end{aligned}
\]
we differentiate the position vector \(\alpha(s)\):
\[
\alpha&#x27;(s) = \frac{d}{ds}[\lambda_1 t + \lambda_2 n] = \lambda_1&#x27; t + \lambda_1 t&#x27; + \lambda_2&#x27; n + \lambda_2 n&#x27;.
\]
Substituting \(t&#x27; = \kappa n\) and \(n&#x27; = -\kappa t + \tau b\), we get:
\[
\alpha&#x27;(s) = (\lambda_1&#x27; - \kappa \lambda_2) t + (\lambda_1 \kappa + \lambda_2&#x27;) n + (\lambda_2 \tau) b.
\]
Since \(\alpha&#x27;(s) = t(s)\), equating the components of the tangent, normal, and binormal vectors gives:
\[
\begin{aligned}
1. &amp;\quad \lambda_1&#x27; - \kappa \lambda_2 = 1, \\
2. &amp;\quad \lambda_1 \kappa + \lambda_2&#x27; = 0, \\
3. &amp;\quad \lambda_2 \tau = 0.
\end{aligned}
\]
From the third equation, \(\lambda_2 \tau = 0\). If \(\lambda_2 \neq 0\), then \(\tau = 0\). If \(\lambda_2 = 0\) in some interval, the second equation implies \(\lambda_1 \kappa = 0\). If \(\kappa \neq 0\), then \(\lambda_1 = 0\), leading to a contradiction in the first equation. Thus, \(\lambda_2\) cannot be zero in any interval, implying \(\tau = 0\) everywhere.

Therefore, the torsion \(\tau\) must be zero for an osculating curve.

α&#x27;(s) = d/ds [λ₁ t + λ₂ n]

Using the Frenet-Serret formulas, substitute t&#x27; = κ n and n&#x27; = -κ t + τ b:

= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ (κ n) + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ (-κ t + τ b)
= (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) t + (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) n + (λ₂ τ) b

But we know that α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Therefore, equating components:

1. The coefficient of t: (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) = 1
2. The coefficient of n: (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) = 0
3. The coefficient of b: λ₂ τ = 0

So, from the third equation, we have λ₂ τ = 0. This equation must hold for all s. If λ₂ is not identically zero, then τ must be zero. However, if λ₂ is zero everywhere, then from the second equation, λ₁ κ = 0. If κ is not zero (since we are dealing with a curve with an osculating plane, curvature can&#x27;t be zero?), then λ₁ must be zero. But then from the first equation, 0 - 0 = 1, which is impossible.

b&#x27;(s) = -τ(s)n(s)

Here, t is the tangent vector, n is the normal vector, b is the binormal vector, κ is the curvature, and τ is the torsion.

Since the position vector α(s) lies in the osculating plane, it can be expressed as α(s) = λ₁(s)t(s) + λ₂(s)n(s). Let me differentiate this expression with respect to s to see if I can derive relations involving κ and τ.

α&#x27;(s) = d/ds [λ₁ t + λ₂ n]

Using the Frenet-Serret formulas, substitute t&#x27; = κ n and n&#x27; = -κ t + τ b:

= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ (κ n) + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ (-κ t + τ b)
= (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) t + (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) n + (λ₂ τ) b

But we know that α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Therefore, equating components:

1. The coefficient of t: (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) = 1
2. The coefficient of n: (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) = 0
3. The coefficient of b: λ₂ τ = 0

So, from the third equation, we have λ₂ τ = 0. This equation must hold for all s. If λ₂ is not identically zero, then τ must be zero. However, if λ₂ is zero everywhere, then from the second equation, λ₁ κ = 0. If κ is not zero (since we are dealing with a curve with an osculating plane, curvature can&#x27;t be zero?), then λ₁ must be zero. But then from the first equation, 0 - 0 = 1, which is impossible.

we differentiate the position vector \(\alpha(s)\):

\alpha&#x27;(s) = \frac{d}{ds}[\lambda_1 t + \lambda_2 n] = \lambda_1&#x27; t + \lambda_1 t&#x27; + \lambda_2&#x27; n + \lambda_2 n&#x27;.
\]
Substituting \(t&#x27; = \kappa n\) and \(n&#x27; = -\kappa t + \tau b\), we get:
\[
\alpha&#x27;(s) = (\lambda_1&#x27; - \kappa \lambda_2) t + (\lambda_1 \kappa + \lambda_2&#x27;) n + (\lambda_2 \tau) b.

Since \(\alpha&#x27;(s) = t(s)\), equating the components of the tangent, normal, and binormal vectors gives:

2. &amp;\quad \lambda_1 \kappa + \lambda_2&#x27; = 0, \\
3. &amp;\quad \lambda_2 \tau = 0.
\end{aligned}
\]
From the third equation, \(\lambda_2 \tau = 0\). If \(\lambda_2 \neq 0\), then \(\tau = 0\). If \(\lambda_2 = 0\) in some interval, the second equation implies \(\lambda_1 \kappa = 0\). If \(\kappa \neq 0\), then \(\lambda_1 = 0\), leading to a contradiction in the first equation. Thus, \(\lambda_2\) cannot be zero in any interval, implying \(\tau = 0\) everywhere.

Therefore, the torsion \(\tau\) must be zero for an osculating curve.

Problem: Determine whether the torsion is zero for an osculating curve in Euclidean space. A curve is called an osculating curve if its position vector lies on its osculating plane. The osculating plane for the curve \( \alpha(s) \) at some point is generated by the tangent vector and normal vector of \( \alpha \) at that point, i.e., \( \alpha(s)=\lambda_1(s)t(s)+\lambda_2(s)n(s) \) for some functions \( \lambda_1(s) \) and \( \lambda_2(s) \). Is the torsion zero for such a curve? Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Yes, the torsion is zero. Let \( \lambda_1(s) \) be the Euclidean length of the tangent vector and let \( \lambda_2(s) \) be its dot product with our base vector \( e_{1} \). Then its osculating curve can be written \( \alpha(s)=\lambda_1(s)t(s)=\lambda_1(s)e_{1}t(s)+\lambda_2(s)e_{2}t(s) \). This differs from the definition of \( \alpha(s) \) by the first coordinate, which is zero. Therefore, the osculating plane is just an element of the family \( r_{1}e_{1}+r_{2}e_{2} \) of planes that keep the base vector \( e_{1} \). If there exists a point \( x \in \mathbb{E}^{3} \) such that \( \alpha(s)=\lambda_1(s)t(s) \) for some \( s \), then \( x=r_{1}e_{1} \), so, if the \( e_{1} \)-coordinate of \( x \) is nonzero, the osculating plane reduces to \( e_{1} \), and \( \lambda_1(s)=1 \), so we can write \( x=\mu t(s) \) for some function \( \mu(s) \), contradicting the definition of \( \alpha(s) \). Thus \( \lambda_1(s)=0 \) for all \( s \), and \( \lambda_2(s)=0 \) for all \( s \), so \( \tfrac{\partial\alpha}{\partial s}=\lambda_1\left(1t+w=\alpha=0t+w=0\right)=e_{2}n(s) \), where \( n(s)=t(s)\times w(s) \) is a normal vector, and \( \lambda_1(t)=0 \) for all \( t \), so \( \lVert n \rVert=\lVert n \rVert \) at all times, which means \( n(s)\) is constant, so \( n(s)=n \) for all \( s \), and \( t(s)\times n \) is also a normal vector, which means \( n(t)\times n=s \) for all \( t \), so, since \( n\neq 0 \) at some \( t_{0} \), we must have \( \lambda_{2}(t_{0})=s_{1}=0 \), at all \( t \), so \( n(t)=n \) for all \( t \). Thus, our curve \( \alpha(s)=\lambda_1(s)t(s)+\lambda_2(s)n \) has a constant normal, which we can re-write as a composition of functions \( \alpha(s)=\lambda\left(\lambda_{1}(s)n\right)+\lambda_2(s)n \) where \( \lambda \) is a scalar function at all \( s \). Taking the derivative we see that \( \tfrac{d\alpha}{d\tau}=\tfrac{\partial\alpha}{\partial\lambda_{1}}\tfrac{d \lambda_{1}}{ds}+\tfrac{\partial\alpha}{\partial\lambda_{2}}\tfrac{d \lambda_{2}}{ds} \), so the torsion is zero. \boxed{Yes}&lt;|end_of_text|&gt;          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the torsion is zero for an osculating curve in Euclidean space. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts. An osculating curve is defined as a curve whose position vector lies entirely within its osculating plane. The osculating plane at a point on a curve is the plane spanned by the tangent vector and the normal vector. So, for such a curve, we can write the position vector α(s) as a linear combination of the tangent vector t(s) and the normal vector n(s), right? That is, α(s) = λ₁(s)t(s) + λ₂(s)n(s) for some scalar functions λ₁ and λ₂.

Now, the question is about torsion. Torsion τ measures how much the curve twists out of the osculating plane. If the torsion is zero, the curve lies entirely within a fixed plane, making it a plane curve. So, intuitively, if the position vector is always in the osculating plane, maybe the curve doesn&#x27;t twist out of that plane, implying zero torsion. But I need to verify this mathematically.

Let me recall the Frenet-Serret formulas for a curve parameterized by arc length s:

t&#x27;(s) = κ(s)n(s)
n&#x27;(s) = -κ(s)t(s) + τ(s)b(s)
b&#x27;(s) = -τ(s)n(s)

Here, t is the tangent vector, n is the normal vector, b is the binormal vector, κ is the curvature, and τ is the torsion.

Since the position vector α(s) lies in the osculating plane, it can be expressed as α(s) = λ₁(s)t(s) + λ₂(s)n(s). Let me differentiate this expression with respect to s to see if I can derive relations involving κ and τ.

First, compute α&#x27;(s). Since α is parameterized by arc length, α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Differentiating the given expression:

α&#x27;(s) = d/ds [λ₁ t + λ₂ n]
= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ t&#x27; + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ n&#x27;

Using the Frenet-Serret formulas, substitute t&#x27; = κ n and n&#x27; = -κ t + τ b:

= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ (κ n) + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ (-κ t + τ b)
= (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) t + (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) n + (λ₂ τ) b

But we know that α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Therefore, equating components:

1. The coefficient of t: (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) = 1
2. The coefficient of n: (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) = 0
3. The coefficient of b: λ₂ τ = 0

So, from the third equation, we have λ₂ τ = 0. This equation must hold for all s. If λ₂ is not identically zero, then τ must be zero. However, if λ₂ is zero everywhere, then from the second equation, λ₁ κ = 0. If κ is not zero (since we are dealing with a curve with an osculating plane, curvature can&#x27;t be zero?), then λ₁ must be zero. But then from the first equation, 0 - 0 = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, λ₂ cannot be identically zero.

Therefore, since λ₂ is not identically zero, from λ₂ τ = 0, it follows that τ must be identically zero. Hence, the torsion is zero for an osculating curve.

Wait, let me check this again. Suppose λ₂ is not zero at some point, then τ must be zero at that point. But since we have to hold for all s, unless λ₂ is zero everywhere, which we saw leads to a contradiction, τ must be zero everywhere. Therefore, the torsion is zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a case where λ₂ is zero at some points but not others. For example, if λ₂ is zero in some intervals and non-zero in others. But then in the intervals where λ₂ is non-zero, τ would have to be zero. However, torsion is a smooth function, so if τ is zero on an interval, and the curve is analytic, it would be zero everywhere. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify analyticity, so torsion could be zero on some parts and non-zero on others where λ₂ is zero. However, in the regions where λ₂ is zero, from the second equation, λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27; = 0. If λ₂ is zero in an interval, then λ₂&#x27; is also zero there, so λ₁ κ = 0. If κ ≠ 0, then λ₁ = 0. Then from the first equation, λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂ = 0 - 0 = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, even if λ₂ is zero in an interval, we get a contradiction, so λ₂ cannot be zero in any interval. Therefore, τ must be zero everywhere.

Therefore, the torsion τ is zero for an osculating curve.

Wait, but let me think of an example. A plane curve has τ = 0, and its position vector lies in the plane, which is the osculating plane. So, yes, plane curves are osculating curves with τ = 0. But are there non-plane curves (with τ ≠ 0) that are osculating curves? According to the above reasoning, no. Because if the position vector lies in the osculating plane everywhere, then τ must be zero.

Alternatively, maybe a circular helix? But the position vector of a helix doesn&#x27;t lie in the osculating plane. Let me check. The osculating plane of a helix is the plane spanned by t and n. The position vector for a helix is (a cos t, a sin t, bt). The tangent vector t is (-a sin t, a cos t, b)/sqrt(a² + b²), and the normal vector n is (-cos t, -sin t, 0). So, the osculating plane is spanned by t and n. The position vector would have components in the t, n, and b directions? Maybe not lying entirely in the osculating plane. So probably, helices are not osculating curves.

Therefore, the conclusion is that torsion must be zero. Therefore, the answer is yes, the torsion is zero for such a curve.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the torsion is zero for an osculating curve in Euclidean space, we start by noting that an osculating curve has its position vector lying in the osculating plane. This means the position vector \(\alpha(s)\) can be expressed as \(\alpha(s) = \lambda_1(s)t(s) + \lambda_2(s)n(s)\) for some scalar functions \(\lambda_1(s)\) and \(\lambda_2(s)\).

Using the Frenet-Serret formulas for a curve parameterized by arc length \(s\):
\[
\begin{aligned}
t&#x27;(s) &amp;= \kappa(s)n(s), \\
n&#x27;(s) &amp;= -\kappa(s)t(s) + \tau(s)b(s), \\
b&#x27;(s) &amp;= -\tau(s)n(s),
\end{aligned}
\]
we differentiate the position vector \(\alpha(s)\):
\[
\alpha&#x27;(s) = \frac{d}{ds}[\lambda_1 t + \lambda_2 n] = \lambda_1&#x27; t + \lambda_1 t&#x27; + \lambda_2&#x27; n + \lambda_2 n&#x27;.
\]
Substituting \(t&#x27; = \kappa n\) and \(n&#x27; = -\kappa t + \tau b\), we get:
\[
\alpha&#x27;(s) = (\lambda_1&#x27; - \kappa \lambda_2) t + (\lambda_1 \kappa + \lambda_2&#x27;) n + (\lambda_2 \tau) b.
\]
Since \(\alpha&#x27;(s) = t(s)\), equating the components of the tangent, normal, and binormal vectors gives:
\[
\begin{aligned}
1. &amp;\quad \lambda_1&#x27; - \kappa \lambda_2 = 1, \\
2. &amp;\quad \lambda_1 \kappa + \lambda_2&#x27; = 0, \\
3. &amp;\quad \lambda_2 \tau = 0.
\end{aligned}
\]
From the third equation, \(\lambda_2 \tau = 0\). If \(\lambda_2 \neq 0\), then \(\tau = 0\). If \(\lambda_2 = 0\) in some interval, the second equation implies \(\lambda_1 \kappa = 0\). If \(\kappa \neq 0\), then \(\lambda_1 = 0\), leading to a contradiction in the first equation. Thus, \(\lambda_2\) cannot be zero in any interval, implying \(\tau = 0\) everywhere.

Therefore, the torsion \(\tau\) must be zero for an osculating curve.

= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ (κ n) + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ (-κ t + τ b)
= (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) t + (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) n + (λ₂ τ) b

But we know that α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Therefore, equating components:

1. The coefficient of t: (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) = 1
2. The coefficient of n: (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) = 0
3. The coefficient of b: λ₂ τ = 0

So, from the third equation, we have λ₂ τ = 0. This equation must hold for all s. If λ₂ is not identically zero, then τ must be zero. However, if λ₂ is zero everywhere, then from the second equation, λ₁ κ = 0.

Here, t is the tangent vector, n is the normal vector, b is the binormal vector, κ is the curvature, and τ is the torsion.

Since the position vector α(s) lies in the osculating plane, it can be expressed as α(s) = λ₁(s)t(s) + λ₂(s)n(s). Let me differentiate this expression with respect to s to see if I can derive relations involving κ and τ.

First, compute α&#x27;(s). Since α is parameterized by arc length, α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Differentiating the given expression:

α&#x27;(s) = d/ds [λ₁ t + λ₂ n]
= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ t&#x27; + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ n&#x27;

Using the Frenet-Serret formulas, substitute t&#x27; = κ n and n&#x27; = -κ t + τ b:

= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ (κ n) + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ (-κ t + τ b)
= (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) t + (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) n + (λ₂ τ) b

But we know that α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Therefore, equating components:

1. The coefficient of t: (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) = 1
2. The coefficient of n: (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) = 0
3. The coefficient of b: λ₂ τ = 0

So, from the third equation, we have λ₂ τ = 0. This equation must hold for all s. If λ₂ is not identically zero, then τ must be zero. However, if λ₂ is zero everywhere, then from the second equation, λ₁ κ = 0. If κ is not zero (since we are dealing with a curve with an osculating plane, curvature can&#x27;t be zero?), then λ₁ must be zero. But then from the first equation, 0 - 0 = 1, which is impossible.

However, in the regions where λ₂ is zero, from the second equation, λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27; = 0. If λ₂ is zero in an interval, then λ₂&#x27; is also zero there, so λ₁ κ = 0. If κ ≠ 0, then λ₁ = 0. Then from the first equation, λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂ = 0 - 0 = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, even if λ₂ is zero in an interval, we get a contradiction, so λ₂ cannot be zero in any interval. Therefore, τ must be zero everywhere.

Therefore, the torsion τ is zero for an osculating curve.

Wait, but let me think of an example. A plane curve has τ = 0, and its position vector lies in the plane, which is the osculating plane. So, yes, plane curves are osculating curves with τ = 0. But are there non-plane curves (with τ ≠ 0) that are osculating curves? According to the above reasoning, no. Because if the position vector lies in the osculating plane everywhere, then τ must be zero.

Alternatively, maybe a circular helix? But the position vector of a helix doesn&#x27;t lie in the osculating plane. Let me check. The osculating plane of a helix is the plane spanned by t and n. The position vector for a helix is (a cos t, a sin t, bt). The tangent vector t is (-a sin t, a cos t, b)/sqrt(a² + b²), and the normal vector n is (-cos t, -sin t, 0). So, the osculating plane is spanned by t and n. The position vector would have components in the t, n, and b directions? Maybe not lying entirely in the osculating plane. So probably, helices are not osculating curves.

Therefore, the conclusion is that torsion must be zero. Therefore, the answer is yes, the torsion is zero for such a curve.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the torsion is zero for an osculating curve in Euclidean space, we start by noting that an osculating curve has its position vector lying in the osculating plane. This means the position vector \(\alpha(s)\) can be expressed as \(\alpha(s) = \lambda_1(s)t(s) + \lambda_2(s)n(s)\) for some scalar functions \(\lambda_1(s)\) and \(\lambda_2(s)\).

Using the Frenet-Serret formulas for a curve parameterized by arc length \(s\):
\[
\begin{aligned}
t&#x27;(s) &amp;= \kappa(s)n(s), \\
n&#x27;(s) &amp;= -\kappa(s)t(s) + \tau(s)b(s), \\
b&#x27;(s) &amp;= -\tau(s)n(s),
\end{aligned}
\]
we differentiate the position vector \(\alpha(s)\):
\[
\alpha&#x27;(s) = \frac{d}{ds}[\lambda_1 t + \lambda_2 n] = \lambda_1&#x27; t + \lambda_1 t&#x27; + \lambda_2&#x27; n + \lambda_2 n&#x27;.
\]
Substituting \(t&#x27; = \kappa n\) and \(n&#x27; = -\kappa t + \tau b\), we get:
\[
\alpha&#x27;(s) = (\lambda_1&#x27; - \kappa \lambda_2) t + (\lambda_1 \kappa + \lambda_2&#x27;) n + (\lambda_2 \tau) b.
\]
Since \(\alpha&#x27;(s) = t(s)\), equating the components of the tangent, normal, and binormal vectors gives:
\[
\begin{aligned}
1. &amp;\quad \lambda_1&#x27; - \kappa \lambda_2 = 1, \\
2. &amp;\quad \lambda_1 \kappa + \lambda_2&#x27; = 0, \\
3. &amp;\quad \lambda_2 \tau = 0.
\end{aligned}
\]
From the third equation, \(\lambda_2 \tau = 0\). If \(\lambda_2 \neq 0\), then \(\tau = 0\). If \(\lambda_2 = 0\) in some interval, the second equation implies \(\lambda_1 \kappa = 0\). If \(\kappa \neq 0\), then \(\lambda_1 = 0\), leading to a contradiction in the first equation. Thus, \(\lambda_2\) cannot be zero in any interval, implying \(\tau = 0\) everywhere.

Therefore, the torsion \(\tau\) must be zero for an osculating curve.

Problem: Determine whether the torsion is zero for an osculating curve in Euclidean space. A curve is called an osculating curve if its position vector lies on its osculating plane. The osculating plane for the curve \( \alpha(s) \) at some point is generated by the tangent vector and normal vector of \( \alpha \) at that point, i.e., \( \alpha(s)=\lambda_1(s)t(s)+\lambda_2(s)n(s) \) for some functions \( \lambda_1(s) \) and \( \lambda_2(s) \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the torsion is zero for an osculating curve in Euclidean space. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts. An osculating curve is defined as a curve whose position vector lies entirely within its osculating plane. The osculating plane at a point on a curve is the plane spanned by the tangent vector and the normal vector. So, for such a curve, we can write the position vector α(s) as a linear combination of the tangent vector t(s) and the normal vector n(s), right? That is, α(s) = λ₁(s)t(s) + λ₂(s)n(s) for some scalar functions λ₁ and λ₂.

Now, the question is about torsion. Torsion τ measures how much the curve twists out of the osculating plane. If the torsion is zero, the curve lies entirely within a fixed plane, making it a plane curve. So, intuitively, if the position vector is always in the osculating plane, maybe the curve doesn&#x27;t twist out of that plane, implying zero torsion. But I need to verify this mathematically.

Let me recall the Frenet-Serret formulas for a curve parameterized by arc length s:

t&#x27;(s) = κ(s)n(s)
n&#x27;(s) = -κ(s)t(s) + τ(s)b(s)
b&#x27;(s) = -τ(s)n(s)

Here, t is the tangent vector, n is the normal vector, b is the binormal vector, κ is the curvature, and τ is the torsion.

Since the position vector α(s) lies in the osculating plane, it can be expressed as α(s) = λ₁(s)t(s) + λ₂(s)n(s). Let me differentiate this expression with respect to s to see if I can derive relations involving κ and τ.

First, compute α&#x27;(s). Since α is parameterized by arc length, α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Differentiating the given expression:

α&#x27;(s) = d/ds [λ₁ t + λ₂ n]
= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ t&#x27; + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ n&#x27;

Using the Frenet-Serret formulas, substitute t&#x27; = κ n and n&#x27; = -κ t + τ b:

= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ (κ n) + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ (-κ t + τ b)
= (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) t + (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) n + (λ₂ τ) b

But we know that α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Therefore, equating components:

1. The coefficient of t: (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) = 1
2. The coefficient of n: (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) = 0
3. The coefficient of b: λ₂ τ = 0

So, from the third equation, we have λ₂ τ = 0. This equation must hold for all s. If λ₂ is not identically zero, then τ must be zero. However, if λ₂ is zero everywhere, then from the second equation, λ₁ κ = 0. If κ is not zero (since we are dealing with a curve with an osculating plane, curvature can&#x27;t be zero?), then λ₁ must be zero. But then from the first equation, 0 - 0 = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, λ₂ cannot be identically zero.

Therefore, since λ₂ is not identically zero, from λ₂ τ = 0, it follows that τ must be identically zero. Hence, the torsion is zero for an osculating curve.

Wait, let me check this again. Suppose λ₂ is not zero at some point, then τ must be zero at that point. But since we have to hold for all s, unless λ₂ is zero everywhere, which we saw leads to a contradiction, τ must be zero everywhere. Therefore, the torsion is zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a case where λ₂ is zero at some points but not others. For example, if λ₂ is zero in some intervals and non-zero in others. But then in the intervals where λ₂ is non-zero, τ would have to be zero. However, torsion is a smooth function, so if τ is zero on an interval, and the curve is analytic, it would be zero everywhere. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify analyticity, so torsion could be zero on some parts and non-zero on others where λ₂ is zero. However, in the regions where λ₂ is zero, from the second equation, λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27; = 0. If λ₂ is zero in an interval, then λ₂&#x27; is also zero there, so λ₁ κ = 0. If κ ≠ 0, then λ₁ = 0. Then from the first equation, λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂ = 0 - 0 = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, even if λ₂ is zero in an interval, we get a contradiction, so λ₂ cannot be zero in any interval. Therefore, τ must be zero everywhere.

Therefore, the torsion τ is zero for an osculating curve.

Let me recall the Frenet-Serret formulas for a curve parameterized by arc length s:

t&#x27;(s) = κ(s)n(s)
n&#x27;(s) = -κ(s)t(s) + τ(s)b(s)
b&#x27;(s) = -τ(s)n(s)

Here, t is the tangent vector, n is the normal vector, b is the binormal vector, κ is the curvature, and τ is the torsion.

Since the position vector α(s) lies in the osculating plane, it can be expressed as α(s) = λ₁(s)t(s) + λ₂(s)n(s). Let me differentiate this expression with respect to s to see if I can derive relations involving κ and τ.

First, compute α&#x27;(s). Since α is parameterized by arc length, α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Differentiating the given expression:

α&#x27;(s) = d/ds [λ₁ t + λ₂ n]
= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ t&#x27; + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ n&#x27;

Using the Frenet-Serret formulas, substitute t&#x27; = κ n and n&#x27; = -κ t + τ b:

= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ (κ n) + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ (-κ t + τ b)
= (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) t + (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) n + (λ₂ τ) b

But we know that α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Therefore, equating components:

1. The coefficient of t: (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) = 1
2. The coefficient of n: (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) = 0
3. The coefficient of b: λ₂ τ = 0

So, from the third equation, we have λ₂ τ = 0. This equation must hold for all s. If λ₂ is not identically zero, then τ must be zero. However, if λ₂ is zero everywhere, then from the second equation, λ₁ κ = 0. If κ is not zero (since we are dealing with a curve with an osculating plane, curvature can&#x27;t be zero?), then λ₁ must be zero. But then from the first equation, 0 - 0 = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, λ₂ cannot be identically zero.

Therefore, since λ₂ is not identically zero, from λ₂ τ = 0, it follows that τ must be identically zero. Hence, the torsion is zero for an osculating curve.

Wait, let me check this again. Suppose λ₂ is not zero at some point, then τ must be zero at that point. But since we have to hold for all s, unless λ₂ is zero everywhere, which we saw leads to a contradiction, τ must be zero everywhere. Therefore, the torsion is zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a case where λ₂ is zero at some points but not others. For example, if λ₂ is zero in some intervals and non-zero in others. But then in the intervals where λ₂ is non-zero, τ would have to be zero. However, torsion is a smooth function, so if τ is zero on an interval, and the curve is analytic, it would be zero everywhere. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify analyticity, so torsion could be zero on some parts and non-zero on others where λ₂ is zero. However, in the regions where λ₂ is zero, from the second equation, λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27; = 0. If λ₂ is zero in an interval, then λ₂&#x27; is also zero there, so λ₁ κ = 0. If κ ≠ 0, then λ₁ = 0. Then from the first equation, λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂ = 0 - 0 = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, even if λ₂ is zero in an interval, we get a contradiction, so λ₂ cannot be zero in any interval. Therefore, τ must be zero everywhere.

Therefore, the torsion τ is zero for an osculating curve.

Wait, but let me think of an example. A plane curve has τ = 0, and its position vector lies in the plane, which is the osculating plane. So, yes, plane curves are osculating curves with τ = 0. But are there non-plane curves (with τ ≠ 0) that are osculating curves? According to the above reasoning, no. Because if the position vector lies in the osculating plane everywhere, then τ must be zero.

Alternatively, maybe a circular helix? But the position vector of a helix doesn&#x27;t lie in the osculating plane. Let me check. The osculating plane of a helix is the plane spanned by t and n. The position vector for a helix is (a cos t, a sin t, bt). The tangent vector t is (-a sin t, a cos t, b)/sqrt(a² + b²), and the normal vector n is (-cos t, -sin t, 0). So, the osculating plane is spanned by t and n. The position vector would have components in the t, n, and b directions? Maybe not lying entirely in the osculating plane. So probably, helices are not osculating curves.

Therefore, the conclusion is that torsion must be zero. Therefore, the answer is yes, the torsion is zero for such a curve.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the torsion is zero for an osculating curve in Euclidean space, we start by noting that an osculating curve has its position vector lying in the osculating plane. This means the position vector \(\alpha(s)\) can be expressed as \(\alpha(s) = \lambda_1(s)t(s) + \lambda_2(s)n(s)\) for some scalar functions \(\lambda_1(s)\) and \(\lambda_2(s)\).

Using the Frenet-Serret formulas for a curve parameterized by arc length \(s\):
\[
\begin{aligned}
t&#x27;(s) &amp;= \kappa(s)n(s), \\
n&#x27;(s) &amp;= -\kappa(s)t(s) + \tau(s)b(s), \\
b&#x27;(s) &amp;= -\tau(s)n(s),
\end{aligned}
\]
we differentiate the position vector \(\alpha(s)\):
\[
\alpha&#x27;(s) = \frac{d}{ds}[\lambda_1 t + \lambda_2 n] = \lambda_1&#x27; t + \lambda_1 t&#x27; + \lambda_2&#x27; n + \lambda_2 n&#x27;.
\]
Substituting \(t&#x27; = \kappa n\) and \(n&#x27; = -\kappa t + \tau b\), we get:
\[
\alpha&#x27;(s) = (\lambda_1&#x27; - \kappa \lambda_2) t + (\lambda_1 \kappa + \lambda_2&#x27;) n + (\lambda_2 \tau) b.
\]
Since \(\alpha&#x27;(s) = t(s)\), equating the components of the tangent, normal, and binormal vectors gives:
\[
\begin{aligned}
1. &amp;\quad \lambda_1&#x27; - \kappa \lambda_2 = 1, \\
2. &amp;\quad \lambda_1 \kappa + \lambda_2&#x27; = 0, \\
3. &amp;\quad \lambda_2 \tau = 0.
\end{aligned}
\]
From the third equation, \(\lambda_2 \tau = 0\). If \(\lambda_2 \neq 0\), then \(\tau = 0\). If \(\lambda_2 = 0\) in some interval, the second equation implies \(\lambda_1 \kappa = 0\). If \(\kappa \neq 0\), then \(\lambda_1 = 0\), leading to a contradiction in the first equation. Thus, \(\lambda_2\) cannot be zero in any interval, implying \(\tau = 0\) everywhere.

Therefore, the torsion \(\tau\) must be zero for an osculating curve.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the torsion is zero for an osculating curve in Euclidean space. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts. An osculating curve is defined as a curve whose position vector lies entirely within its osculating plane. The osculating plane at a point on a curve is the plane spanned by the tangent vector and the normal vector. So, for such a curve, we can write the position vector α(s) as a linear combination of the tangent vector t(s) and the normal vector n(s), right? That is, α(s) = λ₁(s)t(s) + λ₂(s)n(s) for some scalar functions λ₁ and λ₂.

Now, the question is about torsion. Torsion τ measures how much the curve twists out of the osculating plane. If the torsion is zero, the curve lies entirely within a fixed plane, making it a plane curve. So, intuitively, if the position vector is always in the osculating plane, maybe the curve doesn&#x27;t twist out of that plane, implying zero torsion. But I need to verify this mathematically.

Let me recall the Frenet-Serret formulas for a curve parameterized by arc length s:

t&#x27;(s) = κ(s)n(s)
n&#x27;(s) = -κ(s)t(s) + τ(s)b(s)
b&#x27;(s) = -τ(s)n(s)

Here, t is the tangent vector, n is the normal vector, b is the binormal vector, κ is the curvature, and τ is the torsion.

Since the position vector α(s) lies in the osculating plane, it can be expressed as α(s) = λ₁(s)t(s) + λ₂(s)n(s). Let me differentiate this expression with respect to s to see if I can derive relations involving κ and τ.

First, compute α&#x27;(s). Since α is parameterized by arc length, α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Differentiating the given expression:

α&#x27;(s) = d/ds [λ₁ t + λ₂ n]
= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ t&#x27; + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ n&#x27;

Using the Frenet-Serret formulas, substitute t&#x27; = κ n and n&#x27; = -κ t + τ b:

= λ₁&#x27; t + λ₁ (κ n) + λ₂&#x27; n + λ₂ (-κ t + τ b)
= (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) t + (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) n + (λ₂ τ) b

But we know that α&#x27;(s) = t(s). Therefore, equating components:

1. The coefficient of t: (λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂) = 1
2. The coefficient of n: (λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27;) = 0
3. The coefficient of b: λ₂ τ = 0

So, from the third equation, we have λ₂ τ = 0. This equation must hold for all s. If λ₂ is not identically zero, then τ must be zero. However, if λ₂ is zero everywhere, then from the second equation, λ₁ κ = 0. If κ is not zero (since we are dealing with a curve with an osculating plane, curvature can&#x27;t be zero?), then λ₁ must be zero. But then from the first equation, 0 - 0 = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, λ₂ cannot be identically zero.

Therefore, since λ₂ is not identically zero, from λ₂ τ = 0, it follows that τ must be identically zero. Hence, the torsion is zero for an osculating curve.

Wait, let me check this again. Suppose λ₂ is not zero at some point, then τ must be zero at that point. But since we have to hold for all s, unless λ₂ is zero everywhere, which we saw leads to a contradiction, τ must be zero everywhere. Therefore, the torsion is zero.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s a case where λ₂ is zero at some points but not others. For example, if λ₂ is zero in some intervals and non-zero in others. But then in the intervals where λ₂ is non-zero, τ would have to be zero. However, torsion is a smooth function, so if τ is zero on an interval, and the curve is analytic, it would be zero everywhere.

However, in the regions where λ₂ is zero, from the second equation, λ₁ κ + λ₂&#x27; = 0. If λ₂ is zero in an interval, then λ₂&#x27; is also zero there, so λ₁ κ = 0. If κ ≠ 0, then λ₁ = 0. Then from the first equation, λ₁&#x27; - κ λ₂ = 0 - 0 = 1, which is impossible. Therefore, even if λ₂ is zero in an interval, we get a contradiction, so λ₂ cannot be zero in any interval. Therefore, τ must be zero everywhere.

Therefore, the torsion τ is zero for an osculating curve.

n&#x27;(s) &amp;= -\kappa(s)t(s) + \tau(s)b(s), \\
b&#x27;(s) &amp;= -\tau(s)n(s),

\]
we differentiate the position vector \(\alpha(s)\):
\[
\alpha&#x27;(s) = \frac{d}{ds}[\lambda_1 t + \lambda_2 n] = \lambda_1&#x27; t + \lambda_1 t&#x27; + \lambda_2&#x27; n + \lambda_2 n&#x27;.
\]
Substituting \(t&#x27; = \kappa n\) and \(n&#x27; = -\kappa t + \tau b\), we get:
\[
\alpha&#x27;(s) = (\lambda_1&#x27; - \kappa \lambda_2) t + (\lambda_1 \kappa + \lambda_2&#x27;) n + (\lambda_2 \tau) b.
\]
Since \(\alpha&#x27;(s) = t(s)\), equating the components of the tangent, normal, and binormal vectors gives:
\[
\begin{aligned}
1. &amp;\quad \lambda_1&#x27; - \kappa \lambda_2 = 1, \\
2. &amp;\quad \lambda_1 \kappa + \lambda_2&#x27; = 0, \\

we differentiate the position vector \(\alpha(s)\):

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to evaluate this improper integral: \( \int_{0}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos x \sin \sqrt{1+x^{2}}}{\sqrt{1+x^{2}}} \, dx \). Hmm, let&#x27;s see. First, this looks a bit intimidating because of the combination of cosine and sine functions with the square root in the denominator. But maybe there&#x27;s a substitution or a trick that can simplify this.

Let me start by analyzing the integrand. The denominator is \(\sqrt{1 + x^2}\), which reminds me of hyperbolic identities because if I set \(x = \sinh t\), then \(\sqrt{1 + x^2} = \cosh t\), and \(dx = \cosh t \, dt\). Maybe that substitution would help here. Let me try that.

Let’s set \(x = \sinh t\). Then, \(dx = \cosh t \, dt\), and when \(x = 0\), \(t = 0\), and as \(x \to \infty\), \(t \to \infty\). Substituting into the integral, the denominator becomes \(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t} = \cosh t\), so the denominator cancels out with the \(\cosh t\) from the substitution. That simplifies the denominator part. So the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\cos(\sinh t) \sin(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t})}{\cosh t} \cdot \cosh t \, dt = \int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Wait, because \(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t} = \cosh t\), right? So the sine term becomes \(\sin(\cosh t)\). So the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Hmm, that seems a bit simpler, but still not straightforward. Maybe there&#x27;s a trigonometric identity I can use here. The product of cosine and sine can be written as a sum of sines:

\[
\cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(A + B) + \sin(B - A)]
\]

Let me apply that identity here with \(A = \sinh t\) and \(B = \cosh t\). Then:

\[
\cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(\cosh t + \sinh t) + \sin(\cosh t - \sinh t)]
\]

Now, \(\cosh t + \sinh t = e^t\) because \(\cosh t = \frac{e^t + e^{-t}}{2}\) and \(\sinh t = \frac{e^t - e^{-t}}{2}\), so adding them gives \(e^t\). Similarly, \(\cosh t - \sinh t = e^{-t}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})]
\]

Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})] \, dt
\]

So now, I need to evaluate two integrals:

1. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \)
2. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^{-t}) \, dt \)

Let me handle them one by one.

Starting with the second integral because it might be simpler. Let’s make a substitution for the second integral:

Let \(u = e^{-t}\). Then, \(du = -e^{-t} dt\), which implies \(dt = -\frac{du}{u}\). When \(t = 0\), \(u = 1\), and as \(t \to \infty\), \(u \to 0\). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{0} \sin(u) \left(-\frac{du}{u}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du
\]

Oh, that&#x27;s a familiar integral. The integral of \(\frac{\sin u}{u}\) from 0 to 1 is known as the sine integral function, denoted \(\text{Si}(1)\). But in general, \(\int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du\) doesn&#x27;t have an elementary closed-form, but maybe we can leave it as \(\text{Si}(1)\) for now. Wait, but perhaps when combined with the first integral, something cancels or simplifies.

Now, let&#x27;s look at the first integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \).

Let me make a substitution here as well. Let \(v = e^t\), so that \(dv = e^t dt\), which means \(dt = \frac{dv}{v}\). When \(t = 0\), \(v = 1\), and as \(t \to \infty\), \(v \to \infty\). So the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \sin(v) \cdot \frac{dv}{v} = \frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv
\]

Again, this is another sine integral, but from 1 to infinity. The integral of \(\frac{\sin v}{v}\) from 1 to infinity is equal to \(\frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1)\), since the total integral from 0 to infinity is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Therefore:

\[
\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv = \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1)
\]

So putting both integrals together, we have:

Original integral = First integral + Second integral

= \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right ) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \)

Simplifying this, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel out:

= \( \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify that.

Yes, because:

First integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right ) \)

Second integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \)

Adding them together:

\( \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Yes, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel each other out. Therefore, the value of the original integral is \(\frac{\pi}{4}\).

But let me check once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in substitution steps.

Starting from the substitution \(x = \sinh t\), leading to the integral in terms of \(t\), which then splits into two parts. Each substitution for the two integrals seems correct. The integral of \(\sin(e^{-t})\) from 0 to infinity becomes the integral of \(\sin u / u\) from 0 to 1, and the integral of \(\sin(e^t)\) from 0 to infinity becomes the integral of \(\sin v / v\) from 1 to infinity. Then, since the total integral of \(\sin v / v\) from 0 to infinity is \(\pi/2\), the part from 1 to infinity is \(\pi/2 - \text{Si}(1)\), and the part from 0 to 1 is \(\text{Si}(1)\). Then adding the two integrals multiplied by 1/2 cancels the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms.

Hence, the result is indeed \(\pi/4\). That seems correct. Therefore, the value of the integral is \(\pi/4\).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{4}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the improper integral \( \int_{0}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos x \sin \sqrt{1+x^{2}}}{\sqrt{1+x^{2}}} \, dx \), we start by using the substitution \( x = \sinh t \). This transforms the integral into:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Using the trigonometric identity \( \cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(A + B) + \sin(B - A)] \) with \( A = \sinh t \) and \( B = \cosh t \), we rewrite the integrand as:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})]
\]

This splits the integral into two parts:

1. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \)
2. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^{-t}) \, dt \)

For the first integral, substitute \( v = e^t \), transforming it into:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv
\]

This evaluates to \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right) \).

For the second integral, substitute \( u = e^{-t \), transforming it into:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du
\]

This evaluates to \( \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \).

Combining these results, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel out, leaving:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4}
\]

Thus, the value of the integral is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{4}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to evaluate this improper integral: \( \int_{0}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos x \sin \sqrt{1+x^{2}}}{\sqrt{1+x^{2}}} \, dx \). Hmm, let&#x27;s see. First, this looks a bit intimidating because of the combination of cosine and sine functions with the square root in the denominator. But maybe there&#x27;s a substitution or a trick that can simplify this.

Let me start by analyzing the integrand. The denominator is \(\sqrt{1 + x^2}\), which reminds me of hyperbolic identities because if I set \(x = \sinh t\), then \(\sqrt{1 + x^2} = \cosh t\), and \(dx = \cosh t \, dt\). Maybe that substitution would help here. Let me try that.

Let’s set \(x = \sinh t\). Then, \(dx = \cosh t \, dt\), and when \(x = 0\), \(t = 0\), and as \(x \to \infty\), \(t \to \infty\). Substituting into the integral, the denominator becomes \(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t} = \cosh t\), so the denominator cancels out with the \(\cosh t\) from the substitution. That simplifies the denominator part. So the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\cos(\sinh t) \sin(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t})}{\cosh t} \cdot \cosh t \, dt = \int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Wait, because \(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t} = \cosh t\), right? So the sine term becomes \(\sin(\cosh t)\). So the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Hmm, that seems a bit simpler, but still not straightforward. Maybe there&#x27;s a trigonometric identity I can use here. The product of cosine and sine can be written as a sum of sines:

\[
\cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(A + B) + \sin(B - A)]
\]

Let me apply that identity here with \(A = \sinh t\) and \(B = \cosh t\). Then:

\[
\cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(\cosh t + \sinh t) + \sin(\cosh t - \sinh t)]
\]

Now, \(\cosh t + \sinh t = e^t\) because \(\cosh t = \frac{e^t + e^{-t}}{2}\) and \(\sinh t = \frac{e^t - e^{-t}}{2}\), so adding them gives \(e^t\). Similarly, \(\cosh t - \sinh t = e^{-t}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})]
\]

Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})] \, dt
\]

So now, I need to evaluate two integrals:

1. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \)
2. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^{-t}) \, dt \)

Let me handle them one by one.

Starting with the second integral because it might be simpler. Let’s make a substitution for the second integral:

Let \(u = e^{-t}\). Then, \(du = -e^{-t} dt\), which implies \(dt = -\frac{du}{u}\). When \(t = 0\), \(u = 1\), and as \(t \to \infty\), \(u \to 0\). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{0} \sin(u) \left(-\frac{du}{u}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du
\]

Oh, that&#x27;s a familiar integral. The integral of \(\frac{\sin u}{u}\) from 0 to 1 is known as the sine integral function, denoted \(\text{Si}(1)\). But in general, \(\int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du\) doesn&#x27;t have an elementary closed-form, but maybe we can leave it as \(\text{Si}(1)\) for now. Wait, but perhaps when combined with the first integral, something cancels or simplifies.

Now, let&#x27;s look at the first integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \).

Let me make a substitution here as well. Let \(v = e^t\), so that \(dv = e^t dt\), which means \(dt = \frac{dv}{v}\). When \(t = 0\), \(v = 1\), and as \(t \to \infty\), \(v \to \infty\). So the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \sin(v) \cdot \frac{dv}{v} = \frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv
\]

Again, this is another sine integral, but from 1 to infinity. The integral of \(\frac{\sin v}{v}\) from 1 to infinity is equal to \(\frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1)\), since the total integral from 0 to infinity is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Therefore:

\[
\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv = \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1)
\]

So putting both integrals together, we have:

Original integral = First integral + Second integral

= \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right ) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \)

Simplifying this, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel out:

= \( \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify that.

Yes, because:

First integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right ) \)

Second integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \)

Adding them together:

\( \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Yes, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel each other out. Therefore, the value of the original integral is \(\frac{\pi}{4}\).

But let me check once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in substitution steps.

Starting from the substitution \(x = \sinh t\), leading to the integral in terms of \(t\), which then splits into two parts. Each substitution for the two integrals seems correct. The integral of \(\sin(e^{-t})\) from 0 to infinity becomes the integral of \(\sin u / u\) from 0 to 1, and the integral of \(\sin(e^t)\) from 0 to infinity becomes the integral of \(\sin v / v\) from 1 to infinity. Then, since the total integral of \(\sin v / v\) from 0 to infinity is \(\pi/2\), the part from 1 to infinity is \(\pi/2 - \text{Si}(1)\), and the part from 0 to 1 is \(\text{Si}(1)\). Then adding the two integrals multiplied by 1/2 cancels the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms.

Hence, the result is indeed \(\pi/4\). That seems correct. Therefore, the value of the integral is \(\pi/4\).

Commentor: \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) looks like a reasonable estimate, but proving it works usually takes a while.

Assistant: You can use the bigO notation to evaluate the error: \[ \frac{\pi}{2} = 1+\left\lfloor\frac{\pi}{2}\right\rfloor = 1-\left\lfloor\frac{3 \pi}{2}\right\rfloor \] First we note that \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) is in it&#x27;s required range to be \(\mathrm{POW}\left(1,2\right)\), but it&#x27;s a bit smaller. Next, we evaluate the divisions and minus signs using the behavior of the floor function. The error is \[  \left (\frac{\pi}{2}-\frac{3 \pi}{2}\right ) \frac{\ln\left (\frac{{\pi}^{2}/4}{\left(3 \pi /2\right) ^2}\right )- \ln \left(\frac{\pi }{2}\right )}{-\left(1+\left\lfloor\frac{3\pi }{4}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{\pi }{2}\right\rfloor \right) \ln 2} = \pi \frac{ \ln \left(\ln 2\right) - \ln \pi }{1 \ln 2} \] Since neither \(\ln \left(\ln 2\right)\) nor \(\ln \pi\) is small compared to \(\ln 2\), \(\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\) appears to be the best approximation. \boxed{\frac{\pi}{2}}


Commentor: \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) looks promising. I&#x27;m glad you calculated the error, but \(\frac{\ln\left(\ln 2\right)}{1}\approx \(1 + 1.09 \) is very small. So, theoretically, it&#x27;s as good as \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Can you find a useful trick for calculating the error?

Assistant: However \[ \frac{1}{2} \le \frac{\ln \left(\ln 2\right)}{\ln\pi} \le \frac{1}{2} \left(1 + \frac{1}{\ln 2}\right) = \frac{1+10^{-2}}{2} = \frac{3}{4} \] So, the error is between \(1/4\) and \(1\). In this example, a lot of 1s are helpful. We like approximations for which the error is at most \(1 = 10^{0}\). Otheraccuracy ranges tend to come in powers of 10, e.g. \(10^{-2}\) for \(2\) significant digits. \(\boxed{\frac{\pi}{2}}\)

Commentor: Still, you need a time or money estimate for this to be practical. Even factoring in that you&#x27;re an expert in this and could get up to speed in this quickly, \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) still looks good enough to me.

Assistant: We don&#x27;t have to do anything at all with the problem set to solve it if that&#x27;s what you want. If you want a calculator long enough to show its emotion, I&#x27;d suggest a simple one like this: \[ \begin{eqnarray*} \pi \approx 1+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n}\mathcal{B}_n}{n!} &amp; \approx 1+\left (\mathcal{B}_1+ \frac{\mathcal{B}_3}{3} + \frac{\mathcal{B}_5}{5} + \cdots\right ) \\ &amp; \approx 1 + \left (1+\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} + \cdots\right )\\ &amp; \approx 1 + \frac{1}{1} = 1+\boxed{\frac{1}{1}} = \boxed{2} \\ \end{eqnarray*} \] It’s easy to get up to speed if you stare at the numbers enough. Then, it only remains to show the series is convergent. This usually means you only stare at the numbers moderately, which should be reasonably fast. \(\frac{\pi}{2}\)

Yes, very easy.

Substituting into the integral, the denominator becomes \(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t} = \cosh t\), so the denominator cancels out with the \(\cosh t\) from the substitution. That simplifies the denominator part. So the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\cos(\sinh t) \sin(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t})}{\cosh t} \cdot \cosh t \, dt = \int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Wait, because \(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t} = \cosh t\), right? So the sine term becomes \(\sin(\cosh t)\). So the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Hmm, that seems a bit simpler, but still not straightforward. Maybe there&#x27;s a trigonometric identity I can use here. The product of cosine and sine can be written as a sum of sines:

\[
\cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(A + B) + \sin(B - A)]
\]

Let me apply that identity here with \(A = \sinh t\) and \(B = \cosh t\). Then:

\[
\cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(\cosh t + \sinh t) + \sin(\cosh t - \sinh t)]
\]

Now, \(\cosh t + \sinh t = e^t\) because \(\cosh t = \frac{e^t + e^{-t}}{2}\) and \(\sinh t = \frac{e^t - e^{-t}}{2}\), so adding them gives \(e^t\). Similarly, \(\cosh t - \sinh t = e^{-t}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})]
\]

Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})] \, dt
\]

So now, I need to evaluate two integrals:

1. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \)
2. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^{-t}) \, dt \)

Let me handle them one by one.

Starting with the second integral because it might be simpler. Let’s make a substitution for the second integral:

Let \(u = e^{-t}\). Then, \(du = -e^{-t} dt\), which implies \(dt = -\frac{du}{u}\). When \(t = 0\), \(u = 1\), and as \(t \to \infty\), \(u \to 0\). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{0} \sin(u) \left(-\frac{du}{u}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du
\]

Oh, that&#x27;s a familiar integral. The integral of \(\frac{\sin u}{u}\) from 0 to 1 is known as the sine integral function, denoted \(\text{Si}(1)\). But in general, \(\int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du\) doesn&#x27;t have an elementary closed-form, but maybe we can leave it as \(\text{Si}(1)\) for now. Wait, but perhaps when combined with the first integral, something cancels or simplifies.

Now, let&#x27;s look at the first integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \).

Let me make a substitution here as well. Let \(v = e^t\), so that \(dv = e^t dt\), which means \(dt = \frac{dv}{v}\). When \(t = 0\), \(v = 1\), and as \(t \to \infty\), \(v \to \infty\). So the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \sin(v) \cdot \frac{dv}{v} = \frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv
\]

Again, this is another sine integral, but from 1 to infinity. The integral of \(\frac{\sin v}{v}\) from 1 to infinity is equal to \(\frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1)\), since the total integral from 0 to infinity is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Therefore:

\[
\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv = \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1)
\]

So putting both integrals together, we have:

Original integral = First integral + Second integral

= \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right ) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \)

Simplifying this, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel out:

= \( \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify that.

Yes, because:

First integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right ) \)

Second integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \)

Adding them together:

\( \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Yes, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel each other out. Therefore, the value of the original integral is \(\frac{\pi}{4}\).

But let me check once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in substitution steps.

Starting from the substitution \(x = \sinh t\), leading to the integral in terms of \(t\), which then splits into two parts. Each substitution for the two integrals seems correct. The integral of \(\sin(e^{-t})\) from 0 to infinity becomes the integral of \(\sin u / u\) from 0 to 1, and the integral of \(\sin(e^t)\) from 0 to infinity becomes the integral of \(\sin v / v\) from 1 to infinity. Then, since the total integral of \(\sin v / v\) from 0 to infinity is \(\pi/2\), the part from 1 to infinity is \(\pi/2 - \text{Si}(1)\), and the part from 0 to 1 is \(\text{Si}(1)\). Then adding the two integrals multiplied by 1/2 cancels the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms.

Hence, the result is indeed \(\pi/4\). That seems correct. Therefore, the value of the integral is \(\pi/4\).

Response: We use the sine integral as follows: \[\int \frac{\cos x \sin \sqrt{1+x^{2}}}{\sqrt{1+x^{2}}} \mathrm{~d}x = \sin \sqrt{1+x^{2}} (\cos \sqrt{1+x^{2}}+ \sqrt{2} \int{ \sqrt{1+x^{2}} \cos x \mathrm{~d}x})+ C\] Multiplying out the cosine integral and using the identity \(2\sin^2 \alpha =1+ \cos \, 2 \alpha\) results in \(\boxed{ \frac{\pi}{2} - \pi \tan^{-1} \sqrt{1+x^{2}}- \sqrt{2} \int \cos x \sqrt{1+x^{2}}(1+ \cos 2 x) \mathrm{~d}x } \). We see that \(2x \cos x \sin x = \sin 2x\). Therefore, we have \(\boxed{ \frac{\pi}{2} - \pi \tan^{-1} \sqrt{1+x^{2}}-2 \sqrt{2} \int (\sqrt{x^{2}+1+ \sin x} + \sqrt{2}\sin x)(\sin x) \mathrm{~d}x } \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to evaluate this improper integral: \( \int_{0}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos x \sin \sqrt{1+x^{2}}}{\sqrt{1+x^{2}}} \, dx \). Hmm, let&#x27;s see. First, this looks a bit intimidating because of the combination of cosine and sine functions with the square root in the denominator. But maybe there&#x27;s a substitution or a trick that can simplify this.

Let me start by analyzing the integrand. The denominator is \(\sqrt{1 + x^2}\), which reminds me of hyperbolic identities because if I set \(x = \sinh t\), then \(\sqrt{1 + x^2} = \cosh t\), and \(dx = \cosh t \, dt\). Maybe that substitution would help here. Let me try that.

Let’s set \(x = \sinh t\). Then, \(dx = \cosh t \, dt\), and when \(x = 0\), \(t = 0\), and as \(x \to \infty\), \(t \to \infty\). Substituting into the integral, the denominator becomes \(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t} = \cosh t\), so the denominator cancels out with the \(\cosh t\) from the substitution. That simplifies the denominator part. So the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\cos(\sinh t) \sin(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t})}{\cosh t} \cdot \cosh t \, dt = \int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Wait, because \(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t} = \cosh t\), right? So the sine term becomes \(\sin(\cosh t)\). So the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Hmm, that seems a bit simpler, but still not straightforward. Maybe there&#x27;s a trigonometric identity I can use here. The product of cosine and sine can be written as a sum of sines:

\[
\cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(A + B) + \sin(B - A)]
\]

Let me apply that identity here with \(A = \sinh t\) and \(B = \cosh t\). Then:

\[
\cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(\cosh t + \sinh t) + \sin(\cosh t - \sinh t)]
\]

Now, \(\cosh t + \sinh t = e^t\) because \(\cosh t = \frac{e^t + e^{-t}}{2}\) and \(\sinh t = \frac{e^t - e^{-t}}{2}\), so adding them gives \(e^t\). Similarly, \(\cosh t - \sinh t = e^{-t}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})]
\]

Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})] \, dt
\]

So now, I need to evaluate two integrals:

1. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \)
2. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^{-t}) \, dt \)

Let me handle them one by one.

Starting with the second integral because it might be simpler. Let’s make a substitution for the second integral:

Let \(u = e^{-t}\). Then, \(du = -e^{-t} dt\), which implies \(dt = -\frac{du}{u}\). When \(t = 0\), \(u = 1\), and as \(t \to \infty\), \(u \to 0\). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{0} \sin(u) \left(-\frac{du}{u}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du
\]

Oh, that&#x27;s a familiar integral. The integral of \(\frac{\sin u}{u}\) from 0 to 1 is known as the sine integral function, denoted \(\text{Si}(1)\). But in general, \(\int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du\) doesn&#x27;t have an elementary closed-form, but maybe we can leave it as \(\text{Si}(1)\) for now. Wait, but perhaps when combined with the first integral, something cancels or simplifies.

Now, let&#x27;s look at the first integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \).

Let me make a substitution here as well. Let \(v = e^t\), so that \(dv = e^t dt\), which means \(dt = \frac{dv}{v}\). When \(t = 0\), \(v = 1\), and as \(t \to \infty\), \(v \to \infty\). So the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \sin(v) \cdot \frac{dv}{v} = \frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv
\]

Again, this is another sine integral, but from 1 to infinity. The integral of \(\frac{\sin v}{v}\) from 1 to infinity is equal to \(\frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1)\), since the total integral from 0 to infinity is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Therefore:

\[
\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv = \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1)
\]

So putting both integrals together, we have:

Original integral = First integral + Second integral

= \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right ) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \)

Simplifying this, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel out:

= \( \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify that.

Yes, because:

First integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right ) \)

Second integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \)

Adding them together:

\( \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Yes, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel each other out. Therefore, the value of the original integral is \(\frac{\pi}{4}\).

But let me check once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in substitution steps.

Starting from the substitution \(x = \sinh t\), leading to the integral in terms of \(t\), which then splits into two parts. Each substitution for the two integrals seems correct. The integral of \(\sin(e^{-t})\) from 0 to infinity becomes the integral of \(\sin u / u\) from 0 to 1, and the integral of \(\sin(e^t)\) from 0 to infinity becomes the integral of \(\sin v / v\) from 1 to infinity. Then, since the total integral of \(\sin v / v\) from 0 to infinity is \(\pi/2\), the part from 1 to infinity is \(\pi/2 - \text{Si}(1)\), and the part from 0 to 1 is \(\text{Si}(1)\). Then adding the two integrals multiplied by 1/2 cancels the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms.

Hence, the result is indeed \(\pi/4\). That seems correct. Therefore, the value of the integral is \(\pi/4\).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{4}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the improper integral \( \int_{0}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos x \sin \sqrt{1+x^{2}}}{\sqrt{1+x^{2}}} \, dx \), we start by using the substitution \( x = \sinh t \). This transforms the integral into:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Using the trigonometric identity \( \cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(A + B) + \sin(B - A)] \) with \( A = \sinh t \) and \( B = \cosh t \), we rewrite the integrand as:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})]
\]

This splits the integral into two parts:

1. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \)
2. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^{-t}) \, dt \)

For the first integral, substitute \( v = e^t \), transforming it into:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv
\]

This evaluates to \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right) \).

For the second integral, substitute \( u = e^{-t \), transforming it into:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du
\]

This evaluates to \( \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \).

Combining these results, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel out, leaving:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4}
\]

Thus, the value of the integral is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{4}}

Therefore, the integral becomes:

\( \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Yes, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel each other out. Therefore, the value of the original integral is \(\frac{\pi}{4}\).

But let me check once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in substitution steps.

Starting from the substitution \(x = \sinh t\), leading to the integral in terms of \(t\), which then splits into two parts. Each substitution for the two integrals seems correct. The integral of \(\sin(e^{-t})\) from 0 to infinity becomes the integral of \(\sin u / u\) from 0 to 1, and the integral of \(\sin(e^t)\) from 0 to infinity becomes the integral of \(\sin v / v\) from 1 to infinity. Then, since the total integral of \(\sin v / v\) from 0 to infinity is \(\pi/2\), the part from 1 to infinity is \(\pi/2 - \text{Si}(1)\), and the part from 0 to 1 is \(\text{Si}(1)\). Then adding the two integrals multiplied by 1/2 cancels the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms.

Hence, the result is indeed \(\pi/4\). That seems correct. Therefore, the value of the integral is \(\pi/4\).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{4}}

To evaluate the improper integral \( \int_{0}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos x \sin \sqrt{1+x^{2}}}{\sqrt{1+x^{2}}} \, dx \), we start by using the substitution \( x = \sinh t \). This transforms the integral into:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Using the trigonometric identity \( \cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(A + B) + \sin(B - A)] \) with \( A = \sinh t \) and \( B = \cosh t \), we rewrite the integrand as:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})]
\]

This splits the integral into two parts:

1. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \)
2. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^{-t}) \, dt \)

For the first integral, substitute \( v = e^t \), transforming it into:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv
\]

This evaluates to \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right) \).

For the second integral, substitute \( u = e^{-t \), transforming it into:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du
\]

This evaluates to \( \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \).

Combining these results, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel out, leaving:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4}
\]

Thus, the value of the integral is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{4}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to evaluate this improper integral: \( \int_{0}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos x \sin \sqrt{1+x^{2}}}{\sqrt{1+x^{2}}} \, dx \). Hmm, let&#x27;s see. First, this looks a bit intimidating because of the combination of cosine and sine functions with the square root in the denominator. But maybe there&#x27;s a substitution or a trick that can simplify this.

Let me start by analyzing the integrand. The denominator is \(\sqrt{1 + x^2}\), which reminds me of hyperbolic identities because if I set \(x = \sinh t\), then \(\sqrt{1 + x^2} = \cosh t\), and \(dx = \cosh t \, dt\). Maybe that substitution would help here. Let me try that.

Let’s set \(x = \sinh t\). Then, \(dx = \cosh t \, dt\), and when \(x = 0\), \(t = 0\), and as \(x \to \infty\), \(t \to \infty\). Substituting into the integral, the denominator becomes \(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t} = \cosh t\), so the denominator cancels out with the \(\cosh t\) from the substitution. That simplifies the denominator part. So the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\cos(\sinh t) \sin(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t})}{\cosh t} \cdot \cosh t \, dt = \int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Wait, because \(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t} = \cosh t\), right? So the sine term becomes \(\sin(\cosh t)\). So the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Hmm, that seems a bit simpler, but still not straightforward. Maybe there&#x27;s a trigonometric identity I can use here. The product of cosine and sine can be written as a sum of sines:

\[
\cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(A + B) + \sin(B - A)]
\]

Let me apply that identity here with \(A = \sinh t\) and \(B = \cosh t\). Then:

\[
\cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(\cosh t + \sinh t) + \sin(\cosh t - \sinh t)]
\]

Now, \(\cosh t + \sinh t = e^t\) because \(\cosh t = \frac{e^t + e^{-t}}{2}\) and \(\sinh t = \frac{e^t - e^{-t}}{2}\), so adding them gives \(e^t\). Similarly, \(\cosh t - \sinh t = e^{-t}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})]
\]

Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})] \, dt
\]

So now, I need to evaluate two integrals:

1. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \)
2. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^{-t}) \, dt \)

Let me handle them one by one.

Starting with the second integral because it might be simpler. Let’s make a substitution for the second integral:

Let \(u = e^{-t}\). Then, \(du = -e^{-t} dt\), which implies \(dt = -\frac{du}{u}\). When \(t = 0\), \(u = 1\), and as \(t \to \infty\), \(u \to 0\). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{0} \sin(u) \left(-\frac{du}{u}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du
\]

Oh, that&#x27;s a familiar integral. The integral of \(\frac{\sin u}{u}\) from 0 to 1 is known as the sine integral function, denoted \(\text{Si}(1)\). But in general, \(\int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du\) doesn&#x27;t have an elementary closed-form, but maybe we can leave it as \(\text{Si}(1)\) for now. Wait, but perhaps when combined with the first integral, something cancels or simplifies.

Now, let&#x27;s look at the first integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \).

Let me make a substitution here as well. Let \(v = e^t\), so that \(dv = e^t dt\), which means \(dt = \frac{dv}{v}\). When \(t = 0\), \(v = 1\), and as \(t \to \infty\), \(v \to \infty\). So the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \sin(v) \cdot \frac{dv}{v} = \frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv
\]

Again, this is another sine integral, but from 1 to infinity. The integral of \(\frac{\sin v}{v}\) from 1 to infinity is equal to \(\frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1)\), since the total integral from 0 to infinity is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Therefore:

\[
\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv = \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1)
\]

So putting both integrals together, we have:

Original integral = First integral + Second integral

= \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right ) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \)

Simplifying this, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel out:

= \( \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify that.

Yes, because:

First integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right ) \)

Second integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \)

Adding them together:

\( \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Yes, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel each other out. Therefore, the value of the original integral is \(\frac{\pi}{4}\).

But let me check once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in substitution steps.

Starting from the substitution \(x = \sinh t\), leading to the integral in terms of \(t\), which then splits into two parts. Each substitution for the two integrals seems correct. The integral of \(\sin(e^{-t})\) from 0 to infinity becomes the integral of \(\sin u / u\) from 0 to 1, and the integral of \(\sin(e^t)\) from 0 to infinity becomes the integral of \(\sin v / v\) from 1 to infinity. Then, since the total integral of \(\sin v / v\) from 0 to infinity is \(\pi/2\), the part from 1 to infinity is \(\pi/2 - \text{Si}(1)\), and the part from 0 to 1 is \(\text{Si}(1)\). Then adding the two integrals multiplied by 1/2 cancels the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms.

Oh, that&#x27;s a familiar integral. The integral of \(\frac{\sin u}{u}\) from 0 to 1 is known as the sine integral function, denoted \(\text{Si}(1)\). But in general, \(\int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du\) doesn&#x27;t have an elementary closed-form, but maybe we can leave it as \(\text{Si}(1)\) for now. Wait, but perhaps when combined with the first integral, something cancels or simplifies.

Now, let&#x27;s look at the first integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \).

Let me make a substitution here as well. Let \(v = e^t\), so that \(dv = e^t dt\), which means \(dt = \frac{dv}{v}\). When \(t = 0\), \(v = 1\), and as \(t \to \infty\), \(v \to \infty\). So the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \sin(v) \cdot \frac{dv}{v} = \frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv
\]

Again, this is another sine integral, but from 1 to infinity. The integral of \(\frac{\sin v}{v}\) from 1 to infinity is equal to \(\frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1)\), since the total integral from 0 to infinity is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Therefore:

\[
\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv = \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1)
\]

So putting both integrals together, we have:

Original integral = First integral + Second integral

= \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right ) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \)

Simplifying this, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel out:

= \( \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify that.

Yes, because:

First integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right ) \)

Second integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \)

Adding them together:

\( \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Yes, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel each other out. Therefore, the value of the original integral is \(\frac{\pi}{4}\).

But let me check once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in substitution steps.

Starting from the substitution \(x = \sinh t\), leading to the integral in terms of \(t\), which then splits into two parts. Each substitution for the two integrals seems correct. The integral of \(\sin(e^{-t})\) from 0 to infinity becomes the integral of \(\sin u / u\) from 0 to 1, and the integral of \(\sin(e^t)\) from 0 to infinity becomes the integral of \(\sin v / v\) from 1 to infinity. Then, since the total integral of \(\sin v / v\) from 0 to infinity is \(\pi/2\), the part from 1 to infinity is \(\pi/2 - \text{Si}(1)\), and the part from 0 to 1 is \(\text{Si}(1)\). Then adding the two integrals multiplied by 1/2 cancels the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms.

Hence, the result is indeed \(\pi/4\). That seems correct. Therefore, the value of the integral is \(\pi/4\).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{4}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the improper integral \( \int_{0}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos x \sin \sqrt{1+x^{2}}}{\sqrt{1+x^{2}}} \, dx \), we start by using the substitution \( x = \sinh t \). This transforms the integral into:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Using the trigonometric identity \( \cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(A + B) + \sin(B - A)] \) with \( A = \sinh t \) and \( B = \cosh t \), we rewrite the integrand as:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})]
\]

This splits the integral into two parts:

1. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \)
2. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^{-t}) \, dt \)

For the first integral, substitute \( v = e^t \), transforming it into:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv
\]

This evaluates to \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right) \).

For the second integral, substitute \( u = e^{-t \), transforming it into:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du
\]

This evaluates to \( \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \).

Combining these results, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel out, leaving:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4}
\]

Thus, the value of the integral is:

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to evaluate this improper integral: \( \int_{0}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos x \sin \sqrt{1+x^{2}}}{\sqrt{1+x^{2}}} \, dx \). Hmm, let&#x27;s see. First, this looks a bit intimidating because of the combination of cosine and sine functions with the square root in the denominator. But maybe there&#x27;s a substitution or a trick that can simplify this.

Let me start by analyzing the integrand. The denominator is \(\sqrt{1 + x^2}\), which reminds me of hyperbolic identities because if I set \(x = \sinh t\), then \(\sqrt{1 + x^2} = \cosh t\), and \(dx = \cosh t \, dt\). Maybe that substitution would help here. Let me try that.

Let’s set \(x = \sinh t\). Then, \(dx = \cosh t \, dt\), and when \(x = 0\), \(t = 0\), and as \(x \to \infty\), \(t \to \infty\). Substituting into the integral, the denominator becomes \(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t} = \cosh t\), so the denominator cancels out with the \(\cosh t\) from the substitution. That simplifies the denominator part. So the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\cos(\sinh t) \sin(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t})}{\cosh t} \cdot \cosh t \, dt = \int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Wait, because \(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t} = \cosh t\), right? So the sine term becomes \(\sin(\cosh t)\). So the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Hmm, that seems a bit simpler, but still not straightforward. Maybe there&#x27;s a trigonometric identity I can use here. The product of cosine and sine can be written as a sum of sines:

\[
\cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(A + B) + \sin(B - A)]
\]

Let me apply that identity here with \(A = \sinh t\) and \(B = \cosh t\). Then:

\[
\cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(\cosh t + \sinh t) + \sin(\cosh t - \sinh t)]
\]

Now, \(\cosh t + \sinh t = e^t\) because \(\cosh t = \frac{e^t + e^{-t}}{2}\) and \(\sinh t = \frac{e^t - e^{-t}}{2}\), so adding them gives \(e^t\). Similarly, \(\cosh t - \sinh t = e^{-t}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})]
\]

Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})] \, dt
\]

So now, I need to evaluate two integrals:

1. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \)
2. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^{-t}) \, dt \)

Let me handle them one by one.

Starting with the second integral because it might be simpler. Let’s make a substitution for the second integral:

Let \(u = e^{-t}\). Then, \(du = -e^{-t} dt\), which implies \(dt = -\frac{du}{u}\). When \(t = 0\), \(u = 1\), and as \(t \to \infty\), \(u \to 0\). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{0} \sin(u) \left(-\frac{du}{u}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du
\]

Oh, that&#x27;s a familiar integral. The integral of \(\frac{\sin u}{u}\) from 0 to 1 is known as the sine integral function, denoted \(\text{Si}(1)\). But in general, \(\int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du\) doesn&#x27;t have an elementary closed-form, but maybe we can leave it as \(\text{Si}(1)\) for now. Wait, but perhaps when combined with the first integral, something cancels or simplifies.

Now, let&#x27;s look at the first integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \).

Let me make a substitution here as well. Let \(v = e^t\), so that \(dv = e^t dt\), which means \(dt = \frac{dv}{v}\). When \(t = 0\), \(v = 1\), and as \(t \to \infty\), \(v \to \infty\). So the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \sin(v) \cdot \frac{dv}{v} = \frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv
\]

Again, this is another sine integral, but from 1 to infinity. The integral of \(\frac{\sin v}{v}\) from 1 to infinity is equal to \(\frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1)\), since the total integral from 0 to infinity is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Therefore:

\[
\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv = \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1)
\]

So putting both integrals together, we have:

Original integral = First integral + Second integral

= \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right ) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \)

Simplifying this, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel out:

= \( \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify that.

Yes, because:

First integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right ) \)

Second integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \)

\( \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Wait, because \(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t} = \cosh t\), right? So the sine term becomes \(\sin(\cosh t)\). So the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Hmm, that seems a bit simpler, but still not straightforward. Maybe there&#x27;s a trigonometric identity I can use here. The product of cosine and sine can be written as a sum of sines:

\[
\cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(A + B) + \sin(B - A)]
\]

Let me apply that identity here with \(A = \sinh t\) and \(B = \cosh t\). Then:

\[
\cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(\cosh t + \sinh t) + \sin(\cosh t - \sinh t)]
\]

Now, \(\cosh t + \sinh t = e^t\) because \(\cosh t = \frac{e^t + e^{-t}}{2}\) and \(\sinh t = \frac{e^t - e^{-t}}{2}\), so adding them gives \(e^t\). Similarly, \(\cosh t - \sinh t = e^{-t}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})]
\]

Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})] \, dt
\]

So now, I need to evaluate two integrals:

1. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \)
2. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^{-t}) \, dt \)

Let me handle them one by one.

Starting with the second integral because it might be simpler. Let’s make a substitution for the second integral:

Let \(u = e^{-t}\). Then, \(du = -e^{-t} dt\), which implies \(dt = -\frac{du}{u}\). When \(t = 0\), \(u = 1\), and as \(t \to \infty\), \(u \to 0\). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{0} \sin(u) \left(-\frac{du}{u}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du
\]

Oh, that&#x27;s a familiar integral. The integral of \(\frac{\sin u}{u}\) from 0 to 1 is known as the sine integral function, denoted \(\text{Si}(1)\). But in general, \(\int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du\) doesn&#x27;t have an elementary closed-form, but maybe we can leave it as \(\text{Si}(1)\) for now. Wait, but perhaps when combined with the first integral, something cancels or simplifies.

Now, let&#x27;s look at the first integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \).

Let me make a substitution here as well. Let \(v = e^t\), so that \(dv = e^t dt\), which means \(dt = \frac{dv}{v}\). When \(t = 0\), \(v = 1\), and as \(t \to \infty\), \(v \to \infty\). So the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \sin(v) \cdot \frac{dv}{v} = \frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv
\]

Again, this is another sine integral, but from 1 to infinity. The integral of \(\frac{\sin v}{v}\) from 1 to infinity is equal to \(\frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1)\), since the total integral from 0 to infinity is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Therefore:

\[
\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv = \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1)
\]

So putting both integrals together, we have:

Original integral = First integral + Second integral

= \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right ) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \)

Simplifying this, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel out:

= \( \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify that.

Yes, because:

First integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right ) \)

Second integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \)

Adding them together:

\( \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Yes, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel each other out. Therefore, the value of the original integral is \(\frac{\pi}{4}\).

But let me check once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in substitution steps.

Starting from the substitution \(x = \sinh t\), leading to the integral in terms of \(t\), which then splits into two parts. Each substitution for the two integrals seems correct. The integral of \(\sin(e^{-t})\) from 0 to infinity becomes the integral of \(\sin u / u\) from 0 to 1, and the integral of \(\sin(e^t)\) from 0 to infinity becomes the integral of \(\sin v / v\) from 1 to infinity. Then, since the total integral of \(\sin v / v\) from 0 to infinity is \(\pi/2\), the part from 1 to infinity is \(\pi/2 - \text{Si}(1)\), and the part from 0 to 1 is \(\text{Si}(1)\). Then adding the two integrals multiplied by 1/2 cancels the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms.

Hence, the result is indeed \(\pi/4\). That seems correct. Therefore, the value of the integral is \(\pi/4\).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{4}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the improper integral \( \int_{0}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos x \sin \sqrt{1+x^{2}}}{\sqrt{1+x^{2}}} \, dx \), we start by using the substitution \( x = \sinh t \). This transforms the integral into:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Using the trigonometric identity \( \cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(A + B) + \sin(B - A)] \) with \( A = \sinh t \) and \( B = \cosh t \), we rewrite the integrand as:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})]
\]

This splits the integral into two parts:

1. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \)
2. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^{-t}) \, dt \)

For the first integral, substitute \( v = e^t \), transforming it into:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv
\]

This evaluates to \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right) \).

For the second integral, substitute \( u = e^{-t \), transforming it into:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du
\]

This evaluates to \( \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \).

Combining these results, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel out, leaving:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4}
\]

Thus, the value of the integral is:

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to evaluate this improper integral: \( \int_{0}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos x \sin \sqrt{1+x^{2}}}{\sqrt{1+x^{2}}} \, dx \). Hmm, let&#x27;s see. First, this looks a bit intimidating because of the combination of cosine and sine functions with the square root in the denominator. But maybe there&#x27;s a substitution or a trick that can simplify this.

Let me start by analyzing the integrand. The denominator is \(\sqrt{1 + x^2}\), which reminds me of hyperbolic identities because if I set \(x = \sinh t\), then \(\sqrt{1 + x^2} = \cosh t\), and \(dx = \cosh t \, dt\). Maybe that substitution would help here. Let me try that.

Let’s set \(x = \sinh t\). Then, \(dx = \cosh t \, dt\), and when \(x = 0\), \(t = 0\), and as \(x \to \infty\), \(t \to \infty\). Substituting into the integral, the denominator becomes \(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t} = \cosh t\), so the denominator cancels out with the \(\cosh t\) from the substitution. That simplifies the denominator part. So the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\cos(\sinh t) \sin(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t})}{\cosh t} \cdot \cosh t \, dt = \int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Wait, because \(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t} = \cosh t\), right? So the sine term becomes \(\sin(\cosh t)\). So the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Hmm, that seems a bit simpler, but still not straightforward. Maybe there&#x27;s a trigonometric identity I can use here. The product of cosine and sine can be written as a sum of sines:

\[
\cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(A + B) + \sin(B - A)]
\]

Let me apply that identity here with \(A = \sinh t\) and \(B = \cosh t\). Then:

\[
\cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(\cosh t + \sinh t) + \sin(\cosh t - \sinh t)]
\]

Now, \(\cosh t + \sinh t = e^t\) because \(\cosh t = \frac{e^t + e^{-t}}{2}\) and \(\sinh t = \frac{e^t - e^{-t}}{2}\), so adding them gives \(e^t\). Similarly, \(\cosh t - \sinh t = e^{-t}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})]
\]

Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})] \, dt
\]

So now, I need to evaluate two integrals:

1. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \)
2. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^{-t}) \, dt \)

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{0} \sin(u) \left(-\frac{du}{u}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du
\]

Oh, that&#x27;s a familiar integral. The integral of \(\frac{\sin u}{u}\) from 0 to 1 is known as the sine integral function, denoted \(\text{Si}(1)\). But in general, \(\int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du\) doesn&#x27;t have an elementary closed-form, but maybe we can leave it as \(\text{Si}(1)\) for now.

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \sin(v) \cdot \frac{dv}{v} = \frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv
\]

Again, this is another sine integral, but from 1 to infinity. The integral of \(\frac{\sin v}{v}\) from 1 to infinity is equal to \(\frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1)\), since the total integral from 0 to infinity is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Therefore:

\[
\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv = \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1)
\]

So putting both integrals together, we have:

Original integral = First integral + Second integral

= \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right ) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \)

Simplifying this, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel out:

= \( \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify that.

Yes, because:

First integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right ) \)

Second integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \)

Adding them together:

\( \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Yes, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel each other out. Therefore, the value of the original integral is \(\frac{\pi}{4}\).

That simplifies the denominator part. So the integral becomes:

\cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(A + B) + \sin(B - A)]

Let me apply that identity here with \(A = \sinh t\) and \(B = \cosh t\). Then:

\[
\cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(\cosh t + \sinh t) + \sin(\cosh t - \sinh t)]
\]

Now, \(\cosh t + \sinh t = e^t\) because \(\cosh t = \frac{e^t + e^{-t}}{2}\) and \(\sinh t = \frac{e^t - e^{-t}}{2}\), so adding them gives \(e^t\). Similarly, \(\cosh t - \sinh t = e^{-t}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})]
\]

Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})] \, dt
\]

So now, I need to evaluate two integrals:

Oh, that&#x27;s a familiar integral. The integral of \(\frac{\sin u}{u}\) from 0 to 1 is known as the sine integral function, denoted \(\text{Si}(1)\).

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \sin(v) \cdot \frac{dv}{v} = \frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv
\]

Again, this is another sine integral, but from 1 to infinity. The integral of \(\frac{\sin v}{v}\) from 1 to infinity is equal to \(\frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1)\), since the total integral from 0 to infinity is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Therefore:

\[

Yes, because:

First integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right ) \)

\( \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Yes, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel each other out. Therefore, the value of the original integral is \(\frac{\pi}{4}\).

This evaluates to \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right) \).

For the second integral, substitute \( u = e^{-t \), transforming it into:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du
\]

This evaluates to \( \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \).

Combining these results, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel out, leaving:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4}
\]

Thus, the value of the integral is:

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to evaluate this improper integral: \( \int_{0}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos x \sin \sqrt{1+x^{2}}}{\sqrt{1+x^{2}}} \, dx \). Hmm, let&#x27;s see. First, this looks a bit intimidating because of the combination of cosine and sine functions with the square root in the denominator. But maybe there&#x27;s a substitution or a trick that can simplify this.

Let me start by analyzing the integrand. The denominator is \(\sqrt{1 + x^2}\), which reminds me of hyperbolic identities because if I set \(x = \sinh t\), then \(\sqrt{1 + x^2} = \cosh t\), and \(dx = \cosh t \, dt\). Maybe that substitution would help here. Let me try that.

Let’s set \(x = \sinh t\). Then, \(dx = \cosh t \, dt\), and when \(x = 0\), \(t = 0\), and as \(x \to \infty\), \(t \to \infty\). Substituting into the integral, the denominator becomes \(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t} = \cosh t\), so the denominator cancels out with the \(\cosh t\) from the substitution. That simplifies the denominator part. So the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\cos(\sinh t) \sin(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t})}{\cosh t} \cdot \cosh t \, dt = \int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Wait, because \(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2 t} = \cosh t\), right? So the sine term becomes \(\sin(\cosh t)\). So the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Hmm, that seems a bit simpler, but still not straightforward. Maybe there&#x27;s a trigonometric identity I can use here. The product of cosine and sine can be written as a sum of sines:

\[
\cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(A + B) + \sin(B - A)]
\]

Let me apply that identity here with \(A = \sinh t\) and \(B = \cosh t\). Then:

\[
\cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(\cosh t + \sinh t) + \sin(\cosh t - \sinh t)]
\]

Now, \(\cosh t + \sinh t = e^t\) because \(\cosh t = \frac{e^t + e^{-t}}{2}\) and \(\sinh t = \frac{e^t - e^{-t}}{2}\), so adding them gives \(e^t\). Similarly, \(\cosh t - \sinh t = e^{-t}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})]
\]

Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})] \, dt
\]

So now, I need to evaluate two integrals:

1. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \)
2. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^{-t}) \, dt \)

Let me handle them one by one.

Starting with the second integral because it might be simpler. Let’s make a substitution for the second integral:

Let \(u = e^{-t}\). Then, \(du = -e^{-t} dt\), which implies \(dt = -\frac{du}{u}\). When \(t = 0\), \(u = 1\), and as \(t \to \infty\), \(u \to 0\). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{0} \sin(u) \left(-\frac{du}{u}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du
\]

Oh, that&#x27;s a familiar integral. The integral of \(\frac{\sin u}{u}\) from 0 to 1 is known as the sine integral function, denoted \(\text{Si}(1)\). But in general, \(\int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du\) doesn&#x27;t have an elementary closed-form, but maybe we can leave it as \(\text{Si}(1)\) for now. Wait, but perhaps when combined with the first integral, something cancels or simplifies.

Now, let&#x27;s look at the first integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \).

Let me make a substitution here as well. Let \(v = e^t\), so that \(dv = e^t dt\), which means \(dt = \frac{dv}{v}\). When \(t = 0\), \(v = 1\), and as \(t \to \infty\), \(v \to \infty\). So the integral becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \sin(v) \cdot \frac{dv}{v} = \frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv
\]

Again, this is another sine integral, but from 1 to infinity. The integral of \(\frac{\sin v}{v}\) from 1 to infinity is equal to \(\frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1)\), since the total integral from 0 to infinity is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Therefore:

\[
\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv = \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1)
\]

So putting both integrals together, we have:

Original integral = First integral + Second integral

= \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right ) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \)

Simplifying this, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel out:

= \( \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify that.

Yes, because:

First integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right ) \)

Second integral: \( \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \)

Adding them together:

\( \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) + \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4} \)

Yes, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel each other out. Therefore, the value of the original integral is \(\frac{\pi}{4}\).

But let me check once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in substitution steps.

Starting from the substitution \(x = \sinh t\), leading to the integral in terms of \(t\), which then splits into two parts. Each substitution for the two integrals seems correct. The integral of \(\sin(e^{-t})\) from 0 to infinity becomes the integral of \(\sin u / u\) from 0 to 1, and the integral of \(\sin(e^t)\) from 0 to infinity becomes the integral of \(\sin v / v\) from 1 to infinity. Then, since the total integral of \(\sin v / v\) from 0 to infinity is \(\pi/2\), the part from 1 to infinity is \(\pi/2 - \text{Si}(1)\), and the part from 0 to 1 is \(\text{Si}(1)\). Then adding the two integrals multiplied by 1/2 cancels the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms.

Hence, the result is indeed \(\pi/4\). That seems correct. Therefore, the value of the integral is \(\pi/4\).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{4}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the improper integral \( \int_{0}^{+\infty} \frac{\cos x \sin \sqrt{1+x^{2}}}{\sqrt{1+x^{2}}} \, dx \), we start by using the substitution \( x = \sinh t \). This transforms the integral into:

\[
\int_{0}^{\infty} \cos(\sinh t) \sin(\cosh t) \, dt
\]

Using the trigonometric identity \( \cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin(A + B) + \sin(B - A)] \) with \( A = \sinh t \) and \( B = \cosh t \), we rewrite the integrand as:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\sin(e^t) + \sin(e^{-t})]
\]

This splits the integral into two parts:

1. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^t) \, dt \)
2. \( \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sin(e^{-t}) \, dt \)

For the first integral, substitute \( v = e^t \), transforming it into:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin v}{v} \, dv
\]

This evaluates to \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \text{Si}(1) \right) \).

For the second integral, substitute \( u = e^{-t \), transforming it into:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{1} \frac{\sin u}{u} \, du
\]

This evaluates to \( \frac{1}{2} \text{Si}(1) \).

Combining these results, the \(\text{Si}(1)\) terms cancel out, leaving:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4}
\]

Thus, the value of the integral is:

Response: $x=4$ is perpendicular to $y=b-x$ and the equation of the perpendicular meniscus line is $\frac{x}{5}+\frac{y}{1}=1$. \boxed{\sqrt{\frac{16}{25}}}&lt;|end_of_text|&gt;          </p>

Reference Answer: The line $y=b-x$ intersects the $x$-axis at the point where $0 = b-x$, or $x=b$.  So, we seek the $x$-coordinate of point $Q$.

Since the $y$-axis is parallel to the line $x = 4$, we see that $\angle QSR = \angle QPO$.  Also $QOP = QRS = 90$.  Thus $\triangle QOP \sim \triangle QRS$, so $\frac{[QRS]}{[QOP]} =\left(\frac{QR}{QO}\right)^2$, which means we have $\left(\frac{QR}{QO}\right)^2=\frac{9}{25}$, so $\frac{QR}{QO} = \frac35$.  Since $QR + QO= 4$, we have $\frac35QO + QO = 4$, and $QO =4\cdot \frac58 = \frac52$.  Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of $Q$ is $\frac52 = \boxed{2.5}$.          </p>

Response: We apply the equation from question 2 to every point on $y=b-x$ to get the slope of that line as $b$ and then use the $y$-intercept to get the $y$-value expressed as a function of $x$ to find the ratio of areas. The slope_$b$_-axis_to_$x=4$is calculated by the following tables:

$-\$$ \!420

\(85\$$\!100

\(25\$$\!900

\(125\$$\!2250

\(175\$$\!1400

\(1\$$\!1122

\(7\$$\!14825

\(23\$$\!9730

$$-$$\!22525

$$-$$\!234766

So the slopes are all positive and increase from bottom left to top right. The height of triangle $QRS$ is 5. Then the area of triangle $QRS$ is found by having the coordinates make up its four corners: $OPQRS=-1,0,5,7$ and its area is ${5\over2} \cdot 7$. The area of triangle $QRS$ is 22.5. Next, $OQP=-1,0,-1,1$ and its area is found by averaging the coordinates of its corners so \({1+0-1\over2}\cdot 7=5.5\), or 5.5 square units. So the area of triangle $QOP$ is 9.75 square units, and the ratio of the areas is $9\over25$ which is approximately $0.36$. Substituting this ratio and $x=4$ into the equation $\dfrac{Area\,ofQRS}{Area\,ofQOP}=9:25$, we get 0.2993. Writing this number as a decimal with two places after the decimal point, we get $0.2993$. The final answer is \boxed{0.3} \big)\* (2 pts).

Assistant: Instead of using ratios of areas, we can also use coordinate distance as follows. Since the $x$-coordinates are the same for both sides, all that remains is to add and subtract the $y$-coordinates. Doing so, we get...

$-1 + (-1) + 5 - 5 = 0 + 0 - 0 = 0$

$1 - 0 + 5 - (-4.5) = 1 - 0 +5 +8.5 = 1 + 13.5 = 14.5$

Doing so above, we get area 45 for triangle $QRS$ and area 0 for triangle $QOP$, leading to a ratio of 14.5:0, or a ratio of 45:0, which is the same as 45:1, or a ratio of 45:900, which is the same as $45/900=1/20$. Expressing this number as a decimal with two places after the decimal point, we get $0.05$. Substituting this ratio and $x=4$ into the equation $\dfrac{Area\,ofQRS}{Area\,ofQOP}=9:25$, we get 2.0. Writing this number as a decimal with one place after the decimal point, we get $2.0$. The final answer is \boxed{2} \big)\* (2 pts).

Since $QR + QO= 4$, we have $\frac35QO + QO = 4$, and $QO =4\cdot \frac58 = \frac52$.  Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of $Q$ is $\frac52 = \boxed{2.5}$.          </p>

Response: Recall that the equation of a line is given by $y = m*x + b$, where $m$ is the slope and any number $b$ will work (i.e. $m*x+b$ can describe any point on a line.) We look for a value of $b$ that satisfies $y = b-x$ and the condition that the line must meet the $y$-axis at $P$. Then we look at $x=4$ and move 4 units to the right along the $x$-axis. We count and find 9 triangles. IE we have 9 triangles for $x=2.5$ which is 2.5 times larger. Thus, $\boxed{b=2.25}$. QED.          </p>

Response: Well, $b-x$ is just $4-y$, so line $y=4$ is $x=4-y$. The parts of this that are furthest apart are the parts at $y=4$, so those are (4,0) and (4,-1.5)=(4,0)-(4,-1.5)=(4,0)-5=RQ. For the triangle $QOS$, the height is the entire path from Q to the y-axis (which is the whole thing, since $b&lt;4$), and the width is the distance between the $y$-axis and S (which is also 4). The area is $(4/2)*4=(4)^2/2=4^2$. Now the area of triangle $QOP$is (b/2)*(OS)=(b*4)/2=b*4, and the ratio is 4 to (4/2)=2. So \boxed{b=4}.          </p>

Response: Let $x = OP$, $y = QS$, $z = QR$, and $w = QO$. Since $x = OP = \frac{w}{2}$, we know that $$z=x+y(\frac{1}{9}) = \frac{{w}{2}}{9}.$$ So, in triangle $OQR$, the area is \boxed{0.1x}. In triangle $OQO$, the area is \boxed{0.5x}. $$\text{Area (triangle $QOQ$): } 0.5 \times \frac{w}{2} = \frac{0.5 w}{4}.$$ $$\frac{\text{area (triangle $OQR$)}}{\text{area (triangle $OQO$)}} = \boxed{0.1 \div 0.5} = \boxed{0.2}.$$ Recall that $b = 4-x$.

Response: At $P$, we have $x=0$ and the equation $y = b$. At $S$, we have $b=x-4 = 0$. For the area to be less than that of any triangle in the second quadrant, we must have $b = 2$. \boxed{2}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: The line $y=b-x$ intersects the $x$-axis at the point where $0 = b-x$, or $x=b$.  So, we seek the $x$-coordinate of point $Q$.

Since the $y$-axis is parallel to the line $x = 4$, we see that $\angle QSR = \angle QPO$.  Also $QOP = QRS = 90$.  Thus $\triangle QOP \sim \triangle QRS$, so $\frac{[QRS]}{[QOP]} =\left(\frac{QR}{QO}\right)^2$, which means we have $\left(\frac{QR}{QO}\right)^2=\frac{9}{25}$, so $\frac{QR}{QO} = \frac35$.  Since $QR + QO= 4$, we have $\frac35QO + QO = 4$, and $QO =4\cdot \frac58 = \frac52$.  Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of $Q$ is $\frac52 = \boxed{2.5}$.          </p>

Response: We see from the diagram below that there are two right triangles. The two triangles are $QRS$ and $QBS$ (which can be flipped $180^\circ$ to distinguish the two). We know that the two triangles have the ratio of areas 9:25, since we&#x27;re told that the ratio is 9:25, and $b$ is the height of our triangle $QBS$ and as such it appears to be the same height as $y=4-b=3-b$. Since area is proportional to $1/2$ bases*heights, we know that 1) We know the ratio of bases is $6:2$, since it is 1 unit apart and the missing base is $b/2$, then \boxed{9:25} \boxed{3:4/5} 1) 1) 1) 1) 1) 2) We know that base = 1.5, as it&#x27;s the center of our two triangles, stretch $x$-axis for the non-overlapping triangles, then $1+x-x)1.5=1.5-1.5$ \boxed{b = 3} \boxed{b = \frac{5}{2}} \boxed{b = 3} \boxed{b = 5/2} 2) 2) 1) 1) 1) 3) If $b$ is the smallest side and the hypotenuse is 4, then $b$ is 3; multiply both of these equations to find the answer. \boxed{3} \boxed{11/4} \boxed{3} \boxed{11/4} 3) 3) 4) The other triangles, $QSR$ and $QBR$, are the same as $QBS$ (with base area 1.5) scaled by $2.5,4/5$. \boxed{9:75} \boxed{4:13} \boxed{9:25} \boxed{4 :13} 4) 4) 5) Triangles whose base is $y=3-b$, and whose heights are base length or b/2.

The length of AP is a3 then the distance between P_k and y is \boxed{a/a+1}+a \\ \boxed{[a+1]/(a+1)}+a \\ \boxed{1}+a \\ \boxed{a + 1} \\ \boxed{81} \\ \boxed{80} 8) 8) 9) We see $5:2$ already exists for 4:5, $3:2, 5:3$ and $4:3$ also exist. Triangles $RSB$ and $QOO$ are cut and scaled down by 2 as the $SO$ side. \boxed{5:4} \boxed{5:4} \boxed{4:5} \boxed{5:4} 9) 9) 10) Like Problem 6 (the final product is 4, chopped 2 scale down and the last two miss 13) \boxed{4} \boxed{4:6} \boxed{1.2} \boxed{4 :6} 10) 10) 11) Look at the model from Problem 2. We have that $10=5a$. The length AB is equal to $a+1$, since we found the same ratio [\boxed{6:2}] as we did with [QO] in the previous question. We know that triangle [POO] is square, since the whole diagram is a right triangle and we see that $\frac{1}{2}[PO] = (a+1)[BK] \sqrt2$; since $1\sqrt2= \frac{1}{2}\sqrt2+ 4= \sqrt2+2$ we know that $4\sqrt2$ must be [PC]; this means that $[PS] = [CK] + [PC] = \sqrt2+2$ (let&#x27;s ignore [CB], since it&#x27;s just a small strip) Using setup 1,2, etc, \boxed{4\sqrt2+2} \boxed{25} \boxed{2} \boxed{4\sqrt2 + 2} 11) 11) 12) Simplify the equation, it&#x27;s just $10a$. We do $1- \frac{1}{12}= b^2$. \boxed{10a} \boxed{10a} \boxed{10a} \boxed{10a} 12) 12) 13) We could say that $QSR$ is a triangle with area [1.2/2]*[\sqrt2/2] = [1.2/4] \sqrt2$. Using triangle rule, $[SR]=1.2+1.2 \sqrt2 = 2[\sqrt2]\sqrt2 = 4 \sqrt2$ \boxed{5:4} \boxed{5\sqrt{2}} \boxed{81/14} \boxed{5\sqrt{2}} 13) 13) 14) The area of the triangle [OBK] = base length of [OQ] * height of [QK], in this case we know that it&#x27;s $( 2 + 1.\sqrt2) \sqrt2$. Make two right triangles with this side from the [OBK] part and the [OQ]&#x27;s, we get sides $\sqrt2$ and $\sqrt2+1$ each, which cancel out, leaving us with one real length of\sqrt2,\sqrt2+1$ for our area ($\sqrt2 \sqrt2 = 1$). The side length we add is $1$, and we know we missed $2 (sqrt2) \sqrt2$; we know that triangles $RKB$ and $KOB$ are \boxed{2\sqrt2+1} \boxed{2\sqrt2+1} \boxed{1} \boxed{2\sqrt2+1} 14) 14) 15) View diagram on Khan Academy and make clear triangle $QRB$. Apply triangle rule to this and make a like-triangle rectangle _ (the $b$ side). \boxed{BX=13} \boxed{4} \boxed{BX ≥ 13} \boxed{4} 15) 15) 16) Since triangle $RAR$ is good fit for area formula, we should find how high [RA] is, since that will tell us how much [AB] goes. $[RAR]=\sqrt{BP^2-BA^2}=3\sqrt 2$; If [BA]=2\sqrt 2, then [AB] ≈ [2\sqrt 2] - 3.72 \boxed{[AB] ≈ 2\sqrt2-3.72} \boxed{[AB] ≈ 0.28\sqrt2} 16) 16) 17) $\frac{1}{2}[BR^2] = [\frac{1}{2}BP(2 + \frac{\sqrt2}{2}- \frac{\sqrt2}{2})]$.

Response: The point of intersection $P$ with the $y$-axis is at $(0,2.5)$, and the point of intersection with the line $x = 4$ at $(4,-1.5)$. The ratio of the area is $9:25$.

Response: I&#x27;m tempted to use my regular old &quot;completing the square wouldn&#x27;t be a lot of fun method&quot; to solve this. That might work, but really, we should give it a shot. Some things to notice: we know that the $x$-intercept will be 0. We also know that $b=4-s$. Finally, I think the question means you take the base of the height of $SQ$ and multiply to get the area of triangle $QRS$, not the height of $SQ$ itself. But let&#x27;s just number our points first. $P(0,b),Q(2.5,0),R(4,0),S(4,4-b),O(0,0)$. We can find the slope of $QOS$: given that the $x$-intercept is 0, the slope is $-1$. Therefore, by the Pythagorean Theorem, $\triangle QOS$ has base length 3.5 and height 2, so its area is 3.5*2=$7$. The height of $\triangle QRP$ is $4-b$; we have two other sides, $x=4, OP=SQ$, which is the same as $RQ$ by the Pythagorean Theorem. So $\triangle QRP$ must be a 45-45-90 triangle, with base 3.5 and height $\frac{3.5}{\sqrt{2}}$. Its area is $\frac{3.5^2}{2}=\frac{3.5}{2}$ Thus the area ratio: 7:3.5=2:1, so 9:25=3:5, so b=3.5, for a final answer of \boxed{3.5}.          </p>

Problem: Find the directional derivative of the function \( f(x,y) = \begin{cases}\frac{x^3+y^3}{x^2-y^2},\ x^2-y^2\neq 0 \\\ \,\ \,\ 0 \,\ \,\ ,x^2-y^2=0\end{cases} \) at the point \((0,0)\) in the direction of the vector \(\langle\frac{4}{5},\frac{3}{5} \rangle\). Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Treat the word like a fraction. Combine terms and simplify. First, substitute \(x =-1\) and \(y =0\): \(f(-1,0) = \frac{(-1)^3 +0^3}{(-1)^2-0^2} = \frac{1}{-1} = -1 \). Using the quotient rule to handle the derivative, we have: \( f_x = \frac{3x^2 +y^3}{(x^2-y^2)^2}\). We need a partial derivative with respect to \(x\), so we differentiate the numerator and denominator as always, and set \(y\) equal to \(0\): \(f_{xy} = \frac{6x}{(x^2-0^2)^2} = \frac{6x}{x^2} = 6x\). \(f_{xx} = \frac{12}{x^2}\). Plugging into the quotient rule, first we find: \(f_{xxy} = \frac{12}{-3x^2} + \frac{3x^2}{(x^2-0^2)^3}\). Now, we use that \(\frac{f&#x27;(x,y)}{h}\) equals \(f_x +yf_{xy} +x f_{xy}\), and substitute \(x=0\): \(\frac{f&#x27;(-2/5,3/5)}{h} = \frac{-6}{5^3} + \frac{6x}{5^4} = -\frac{24}{125} + 0 =-\frac{-18}{125} = \boxed{0.72}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the directional derivative of this piecewise function at (0,0) in the direction of the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩. Let me start by recalling what a directional derivative is. The directional derivative of a function f at a point P in the direction of a unit vector u is the rate at which f changes at P in the direction u. The formula for it is the dot product of the gradient of f at P and the unit vector u. But wait, does this function have a gradient at (0,0)? Hmm, the function is defined piecewise, with the value 0 at (0,0) since x² - y² = 0 there. For other points where x² - y² ≠ 0, it&#x27;s (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

First, I need to check if the function is differentiable at (0,0). If it isn&#x27;t, then the gradient might not exist, and I can&#x27;t use the standard gradient formula. Alternatively, even if the gradient doesn&#x27;t exist, the directional derivative might still exist using the limit definition. The directional derivative D_u f(0,0) can be computed as the limit as h approaches 0 of [f((0,0) + h*u) - f(0,0)] / h. Since f(0,0) is 0, that simplifies to the limit as h approaches 0 of f(h*(4/5), h*(3/5)) / h.

So maybe I should use this limit definition directly? Let&#x27;s try that. Let me set up the limit. The direction vector is ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which is already a unit vector because (4/5)² + (3/5)² = 16/25 + 9/25 = 25/25 = 1. So I don&#x27;t need to normalize it. Then, moving along this direction from (0,0), the point after a step h is (4h/5, 3h/5). Now, I need to compute f at this point and then divide by h, taking the limit as h approaches 0.

So let&#x27;s compute f(4h/5, 3h/5). First, check if x² - y² ≠ 0. Let&#x27;s compute x² - y² at (4h/5, 3h/5):

x² - y² = (4h/5)² - (3h/5)² = (16h²/25) - (9h²/25) = 7h²/25. Since h ≠ 0 (we&#x27;re taking the limit as h approaches 0), this is not zero. Therefore, we use the first case of f: (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

So compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = (64h³/125) + (27h³/125) = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = 7h²/25 as above.

Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91h³/125) * (25/(7h²)) = (91h * 25) / (125 * 7) = (91h * 5) / (25 * 7) [because 25/125 = 1/5] Wait, maybe simplifying step by step:

First, 91/7 = 13, so 91 divided by 7 is 13. Then, 25/125 = 1/5. So:

(91/7)*(25/125)*h = 13*(1/5)*h = (13/5)h. Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (13/5)h.

Then, the directional derivative is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(4h/5, 3h/5)] / h = (13/5 h) / h = 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Wait, let&#x27;s verify the calculations again step by step to be sure.

First, substituting x = 4h/5, y = 3h/5.

Compute numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3. Let&#x27;s compute each term:

(4h/5)^3 = 64h³ / 125

(3h/5)^3 = 27h³ / 125

Sum: 64 + 27 = 91, so numerator is 91h³ / 125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (4h/5)^2 - (3h/5)^2 = 16h²/25 - 9h²/25 = 7h²/25.

Thus, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/125)/(7/25) * h = (91/125)*(25/7) * h = (91*25)/(125*7) * h. Simplify 25/125 = 1/5, and 91/7 =13. So 13 * 1/5 = 13/5. Therefore, f(x,y) = (13/5)h.

Then, [f(h) - f(0,0)] / h = (13/5 h - 0)/h = 13/5. So the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5, which exists. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5.

Wait, but I should check if there are any issues with approaching from different directions. But since we are approaching along the specific direction given by the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which parametrizes the line through (0,0) in that direction, the calculation seems valid. Since the limit exists, the directional derivative exists and is 13/5.

But let me think again: sometimes functions can have directional derivatives in all directions but still not be differentiable at a point. However, the question here only asks for the directional derivative in this specific direction, so even if the function isn&#x27;t differentiable at (0,0), as long as the limit exists along this direction, that&#x27;s the answer. 

Is there a possibility that the limit doesn&#x27;t exist here? Let me see. The expression simplified neatly to 13/5 h over h, so 13/5, which is a constant, so the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5. So that&#x27;s straightforward. Therefore, I think the directional derivative is 13/5.

But let me confirm once more. Another way is to parametrize the direction. Let’s suppose we approach along the direction (4/5, 3/5). So we can write x = 4t/5 and y = 3t/5, where t is a parameter approaching 0. Then f(x,y) = [ ( (4t/5)^3 + (3t/5)^3 ) / ( (4t/5)^2 - (3t/5)^2 ) ] = [ (64t³ + 27t³)/125 ] / [ (16t² - 9t²)/25 ] = [91t³/125] / [7t²/25] = (91t³/125) * (25/7t²) = (91*25)/(125*7) * t = (91/35) * (25/125) * t. Wait, but 91/35 is 13/5, since 35*2=70, 91-70=21, 35*2.6=91? Wait, no. Wait 35*2 = 70, 35*2.6 = 70 + 35*0.6 = 70 + 21 = 91. So 91/35 = 2.6, which is 13/5. And 25/125 = 1/5. Wait, no, actually, (91/125)*(25/7) = (91/7)*(25/125) = 13*(1/5) = 13/5. Therefore, it&#x27;s 13/5 * t. Then, [f(t) - f(0)] / t = (13/5 t - 0)/t = 13/5. So same result. So yes, the directional derivative is 13/5. 

Alternatively, if I use the definition of directional derivative: D_u f(0,0) = lim_{h→0} [f(0 + h*(4/5), 0 + h*(3/5)) - f(0,0)] / h. Which is exactly what I computed. So this seems consistent.

Wait, but another thought: since the function is defined as 0 at (0,0), which is on the line x² - y² =0, which at (0,0) is just the origin. But when approaching along the direction (4/5, 3/5), the path x=4h/5, y=3h/5 is such that x² - y² =7h²/25 ≠0 for h≠0, so we are approaching along a path that stays in the region where f is defined by (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). Therefore, the calculation is valid. If we had approached along a direction where x² - y² =0, like along y = x or y = -x, then we would have different behavior. But here, the direction is such that x² - y² ≠0 along that path (except at h=0). Therefore, the limit only involves the expression (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²), which simplifies to 13/5 as h approaches 0.

Therefore, I think the answer is 13/5. Let me check if I made a mistake in simplifying fractions. Let&#x27;s go through the computation again:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = 64h³/125 + 27h³/125 = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (16h²/25 -9h²/25) =7h²/25.

Therefore, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/7)*(h³/h²)*(25/125) =13*(h)*(1/5)=13h/5. Then, [f(x,y) - 0]/h = (13h/5)/h =13/5. Yep, that&#x27;s consistent.

So, even after multiple checks, the answer seems to be 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative at (0,0) in the direction ⟨4/5,3/5⟩ is 13/5.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the directional derivative of the function \( f(x,y) = \begin{cases}\frac{x^3+y^3}{x^2-y^2},\ x^2-y^2\neq 0 \\ 0, \ x^2-y^2=0\end{cases} \) at the point \((0,0)\) in the direction of the vector \(\langle\frac{4}{5},\frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we use the limit definition of the directional derivative.

The directional derivative \( D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) \) in the direction of a unit vector \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is given by:
\[
D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f((0,0) + h\mathbf{u}) - f(0,0)}{h}
\]

Substituting \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we evaluate \( f \) at the point \(( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} )\):

1. **Check the denominator \( x^2 - y^2 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^2 = \frac{16h^2}{25} - \frac{9h^2}{25} = \frac{7h^2}{25} \neq 0 \text{ for } h \neq 0
   \]

2. **Compute the numerator \( x^3 + y^3 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^3 + \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^3 = \frac{64h^3}{125} + \frac{27h^3}{125} = \frac{91h^3}{125}
   \]

3. **Evaluate \( f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) \):**
   \[
   f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) = \frac{\frac{91h^3}{125}}{\frac{7h^2}{25}} = \frac{91h^3}{125} \times \frac{25}{7h^2} = \frac{91h \times 25}{125 \times 7} = \frac{13h}{5}
   \]

4. **Compute the directional derivative:**
   \[
   D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{13h}{5}}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{13}{5} = \frac{13}{5}
   \]

Thus, the directional derivative of the function at \((0,0)\) in the direction of \(\langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the directional derivative of this piecewise function at (0,0) in the direction of the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩. Let me start by recalling what a directional derivative is. The directional derivative of a function f at a point P in the direction of a unit vector u is the rate at which f changes at P in the direction u. The formula for it is the dot product of the gradient of f at P and the unit vector u. But wait, does this function have a gradient at (0,0)? Hmm, the function is defined piecewise, with the value 0 at (0,0) since x² - y² = 0 there. For other points where x² - y² ≠ 0, it&#x27;s (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

First, I need to check if the function is differentiable at (0,0). If it isn&#x27;t, then the gradient might not exist, and I can&#x27;t use the standard gradient formula. Alternatively, even if the gradient doesn&#x27;t exist, the directional derivative might still exist using the limit definition. The directional derivative D_u f(0,0) can be computed as the limit as h approaches 0 of [f((0,0) + h*u) - f(0,0)] / h. Since f(0,0) is 0, that simplifies to the limit as h approaches 0 of f(h*(4/5), h*(3/5)) / h.

So maybe I should use this limit definition directly? Let&#x27;s try that. Let me set up the limit. The direction vector is ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which is already a unit vector because (4/5)² + (3/5)² = 16/25 + 9/25 = 25/25 = 1. So I don&#x27;t need to normalize it. Then, moving along this direction from (0,0), the point after a step h is (4h/5, 3h/5). Now, I need to compute f at this point and then divide by h, taking the limit as h approaches 0.

So let&#x27;s compute f(4h/5, 3h/5). First, check if x² - y² ≠ 0. Let&#x27;s compute x² - y² at (4h/5, 3h/5):

x² - y² = (4h/5)² - (3h/5)² = (16h²/25) - (9h²/25) = 7h²/25. Since h ≠ 0 (we&#x27;re taking the limit as h approaches 0), this is not zero. Therefore, we use the first case of f: (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

So compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = (64h³/125) + (27h³/125) = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = 7h²/25 as above.

Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91h³/125) * (25/(7h²)) = (91h * 25) / (125 * 7) = (91h * 5) / (25 * 7) [because 25/125 = 1/5] Wait, maybe simplifying step by step:

First, 91/7 = 13, so 91 divided by 7 is 13. Then, 25/125 = 1/5. So:

(91/7)*(25/125)*h = 13*(1/5)*h = (13/5)h. Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (13/5)h.

Then, the directional derivative is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(4h/5, 3h/5)] / h = (13/5 h) / h = 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Wait, let&#x27;s verify the calculations again step by step to be sure.

First, substituting x = 4h/5, y = 3h/5.

Compute numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3. Let&#x27;s compute each term:

(4h/5)^3 = 64h³ / 125

(3h/5)^3 = 27h³ / 125

Sum: 64 + 27 = 91, so numerator is 91h³ / 125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (4h/5)^2 - (3h/5)^2 = 16h²/25 - 9h²/25 = 7h²/25.

Thus, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/125)/(7/25) * h = (91/125)*(25/7) * h = (91*25)/(125*7) * h. Simplify 25/125 = 1/5, and 91/7 =13. So 13 * 1/5 = 13/5. Therefore, f(x,y) = (13/5)h.

Then, [f(h) - f(0,0)] / h = (13/5 h - 0)/h = 13/5. So the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5, which exists. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5.

Wait, but I should check if there are any issues with approaching from different directions. But since we are approaching along the specific direction given by the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which parametrizes the line through (0,0) in that direction, the calculation seems valid. Since the limit exists, the directional derivative exists and is 13/5.

But let me think again: sometimes functions can have directional derivatives in all directions but still not be differentiable at a point. However, the question here only asks for the directional derivative in this specific direction, so even if the function isn&#x27;t differentiable at (0,0), as long as the limit exists along this direction, that&#x27;s the answer. 

Is there a possibility that the limit doesn&#x27;t exist here? Let me see. The expression simplified neatly to 13/5 h over h, so 13/5, which is a constant, so the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5. So that&#x27;s straightforward. Therefore, I think the directional derivative is 13/5.

But let me confirm once more. Another way is to parametrize the direction. Let’s suppose we approach along the direction (4/5, 3/5). So we can write x = 4t/5 and y = 3t/5, where t is a parameter approaching 0. Then f(x,y) = [ ( (4t/5)^3 + (3t/5)^3 ) / ( (4t/5)^2 - (3t/5)^2 ) ] = [ (64t³ + 27t³)/125 ] / [ (16t² - 9t²)/25 ] = [91t³/125] / [7t²/25] = (91t³/125) * (25/7t²) = (91*25)/(125*7) * t = (91/35) * (25/125) * t. Wait, but 91/35 is 13/5, since 35*2=70, 91-70=21, 35*2.6=91? Wait, no. Wait 35*2 = 70, 35*2.6 = 70 + 35*0.6 = 70 + 21 = 91. So 91/35 = 2.6, which is 13/5. And 25/125 = 1/5. Wait, no, actually, (91/125)*(25/7) = (91/7)*(25/125) = 13*(1/5) = 13/5. Therefore, it&#x27;s 13/5 * t. Then, [f(t) - f(0)] / t = (13/5 t - 0)/t = 13/5. So same result. So yes, the directional derivative is 13/5. 

Alternatively, if I use the definition of directional derivative: D_u f(0,0) = lim_{h→0} [f(0 + h*(4/5), 0 + h*(3/5)) - f(0,0)] / h. Which is exactly what I computed. So this seems consistent.

Wait, but another thought: since the function is defined as 0 at (0,0), which is on the line x² - y² =0, which at (0,0) is just the origin. But when approaching along the direction (4/5, 3/5), the path x=4h/5, y=3h/5 is such that x² - y² =7h²/25 ≠0 for h≠0, so we are approaching along a path that stays in the region where f is defined by (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). Therefore, the calculation is valid. If we had approached along a direction where x² - y² =0, like along y = x or y = -x, then we would have different behavior. But here, the direction is such that x² - y² ≠0 along that path (except at h=0). Therefore, the limit only involves the expression (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²), which simplifies to 13/5 as h approaches 0.

Therefore, I think the answer is 13/5. Let me check if I made a mistake in simplifying fractions. Let&#x27;s go through the computation again:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = 64h³/125 + 27h³/125 = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (16h²/25 -9h²/25) =7h²/25.

Therefore, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/7)*(h³/h²)*(25/125) =13*(h)*(1/5)=13h/5. Then, [f(x,y) - 0]/h = (13h/5)/h =13/5. Yep, that&#x27;s consistent.

So, even after multiple checks, the answer seems to be 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative at (0,0) in the direction ⟨4/5,3/5⟩ is 13/5.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}

To find the directional derivative of the function \( f(x,y) = \begin{cases}\frac{x^3+y^3}{x^2-y^2},\ x^2-y^2\neq 0 \\ 0, \ x^2-y^2=0\end{cases} \) at the point \((0,0)\) in the direction of the vector \(\langle\frac{4}{5},\frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we use the limit definition of the directional derivative.

The directional derivative \( D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) \) in the direction of a unit vector \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is given by:
\[
D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f((0,0) + h\mathbf{u}) - f(0,0)}{h}
\]

Substituting \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we evaluate \( f \) at the point \(( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} )\):

1. **Check the denominator \( x^2 - y^2 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^2 = \frac{16h^2}{25} - \frac{9h^2}{25} = \frac{7h^2}{25} \neq 0 \text{ for } h \neq 0
   \]

2. **Compute the numerator \( x^3 + y^3 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^3 + \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^3 = \frac{64h^3}{125} + \frac{27h^3}{125} = \frac{91h^3}{125}
   \]

3. **Evaluate \( f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) \):**
   \[
   f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) = \frac{\frac{91h^3}{125}}{\frac{7h^2}{25}} = \frac{91h^3}{125} \times \frac{25}{7h^2} = \frac{91h \times 25}{125 \times 7} = \frac{13h}{5}
   \]

4. **Compute the directional derivative:**
   \[
   D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{13h}{5}}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{13}{5} = \frac{13}{5}
   \]

Thus, the directional derivative of the function at \((0,0)\) in the direction of \(\langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the directional derivative of this piecewise function at (0,0) in the direction of the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩. Let me start by recalling what a directional derivative is. The directional derivative of a function f at a point P in the direction of a unit vector u is the rate at which f changes at P in the direction u. The formula for it is the dot product of the gradient of f at P and the unit vector u. But wait, does this function have a gradient at (0,0)? Hmm, the function is defined piecewise, with the value 0 at (0,0) since x² - y² = 0 there. For other points where x² - y² ≠ 0, it&#x27;s (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

First, I need to check if the function is differentiable at (0,0). If it isn&#x27;t, then the gradient might not exist, and I can&#x27;t use the standard gradient formula. Alternatively, even if the gradient doesn&#x27;t exist, the directional derivative might still exist using the limit definition. The directional derivative D_u f(0,0) can be computed as the limit as h approaches 0 of [f((0,0) + h*u) - f(0,0)] / h. Since f(0,0) is 0, that simplifies to the limit as h approaches 0 of f(h*(4/5), h*(3/5)) / h.

So maybe I should use this limit definition directly? Let&#x27;s try that. Let me set up the limit. The direction vector is ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which is already a unit vector because (4/5)² + (3/5)² = 16/25 + 9/25 = 25/25 = 1. So I don&#x27;t need to normalize it. Then, moving along this direction from (0,0), the point after a step h is (4h/5, 3h/5). Now, I need to compute f at this point and then divide by h, taking the limit as h approaches 0.

So let&#x27;s compute f(4h/5, 3h/5). First, check if x² - y² ≠ 0. Let&#x27;s compute x² - y² at (4h/5, 3h/5):

x² - y² = (4h/5)² - (3h/5)² = (16h²/25) - (9h²/25) = 7h²/25. Since h ≠ 0 (we&#x27;re taking the limit as h approaches 0), this is not zero. Therefore, we use the first case of f: (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

So compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = (64h³/125) + (27h³/125) = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = 7h²/25 as above.

Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91h³/125) * (25/(7h²)) = (91h * 25) / (125 * 7) = (91h * 5) / (25 * 7) [because 25/125 = 1/5] Wait, maybe simplifying step by step:

First, 91/7 = 13, so 91 divided by 7 is 13. Then, 25/125 = 1/5. So:

(91/7)*(25/125)*h = 13*(1/5)*h = (13/5)h. Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (13/5)h.

Then, the directional derivative is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(4h/5, 3h/5)] / h = (13/5 h) / h = 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Wait, let&#x27;s verify the calculations again step by step to be sure.

First, substituting x = 4h/5, y = 3h/5.

Compute numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3. Let&#x27;s compute each term:

(4h/5)^3 = 64h³ / 125

(3h/5)^3 = 27h³ / 125

Sum: 64 + 27 = 91, so numerator is 91h³ / 125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (4h/5)^2 - (3h/5)^2 = 16h²/25 - 9h²/25 = 7h²/25.

Thus, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/125)/(7/25) * h = (91/125)*(25/7) * h = (91*25)/(125*7) * h. Simplify 25/125 = 1/5, and 91/7 =13. So 13 * 1/5 = 13/5. Therefore, f(x,y) = (13/5)h.

Then, [f(h) - f(0,0)] / h = (13/5 h - 0)/h = 13/5. So the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5, which exists. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5.

Wait, but I should check if there are any issues with approaching from different directions. But since we are approaching along the specific direction given by the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which parametrizes the line through (0,0) in that direction, the calculation seems valid. Since the limit exists, the directional derivative exists and is 13/5.

But let me think again: sometimes functions can have directional derivatives in all directions but still not be differentiable at a point. However, the question here only asks for the directional derivative in this specific direction, so even if the function isn&#x27;t differentiable at (0,0), as long as the limit exists along this direction, that&#x27;s the answer. 

Is there a possibility that the limit doesn&#x27;t exist here? Let me see. The expression simplified neatly to 13/5 h over h, so 13/5, which is a constant, so the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5. So that&#x27;s straightforward. Therefore, I think the directional derivative is 13/5.

But let me confirm once more. Another way is to parametrize the direction. Let’s suppose we approach along the direction (4/5, 3/5). So we can write x = 4t/5 and y = 3t/5, where t is a parameter approaching 0. Then f(x,y) = [ ( (4t/5)^3 + (3t/5)^3 ) / ( (4t/5)^2 - (3t/5)^2 ) ] = [ (64t³ + 27t³)/125 ] / [ (16t² - 9t²)/25 ] = [91t³/125] / [7t²/25] = (91t³/125) * (25/7t²) = (91*25)/(125*7) * t = (91/35) * (25/125) * t. Wait, but 91/35 is 13/5, since 35*2=70, 91-70=21, 35*2.6=91? Wait, no. Wait 35*2 = 70, 35*2.6 = 70 + 35*0.6 = 70 + 21 = 91. So 91/35 = 2.6, which is 13/5. And 25/125 = 1/5. Wait, no, actually, (91/125)*(25/7) = (91/7)*(25/125) = 13*(1/5) = 13/5. Therefore, it&#x27;s 13/5 * t. Then, [f(t) - f(0)] / t = (13/5 t - 0)/t = 13/5. So same result. So yes, the directional derivative is 13/5. 

Alternatively, if I use the definition of directional derivative: D_u f(0,0) = lim_{h→0} [f(0 + h*(4/5), 0 + h*(3/5)) - f(0,0)] / h. Which is exactly what I computed. So this seems consistent.

Wait, but another thought: since the function is defined as 0 at (0,0), which is on the line x² - y² =0, which at (0,0) is just the origin. But when approaching along the direction (4/5, 3/5), the path x=4h/5, y=3h/5 is such that x² - y² =7h²/25 ≠0 for h≠0, so we are approaching along a path that stays in the region where f is defined by (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). Therefore, the calculation is valid. If we had approached along a direction where x² - y² =0, like along y = x or y = -x, then we would have different behavior. But here, the direction is such that x² - y² ≠0 along that path (except at h=0). Therefore, the limit only involves the expression (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²), which simplifies to 13/5 as h approaches 0.

Therefore, I think the answer is 13/5. Let me check if I made a mistake in simplifying fractions. Let&#x27;s go through the computation again:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = 64h³/125 + 27h³/125 = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (16h²/25 -9h²/25) =7h²/25.

Therefore, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/7)*(h³/h²)*(25/125) =13*(h)*(1/5)=13h/5. Then, [f(x,y) - 0]/h = (13h/5)/h =13/5. Yep, that&#x27;s consistent.

So, even after multiple checks, the answer seems to be 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative at (0,0) in the direction ⟨4/5,3/5⟩ is 13/5.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the directional derivative of the function \( f(x,y) = \begin{cases}\frac{x^3+y^3}{x^2-y^2},\ x^2-y^2\neq 0 \\ 0, \ x^2-y^2=0\end{cases} \) at the point \((0,0)\) in the direction of the vector \(\langle\frac{4}{5},\frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we use the limit definition of the directional derivative.

The directional derivative \( D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) \) in the direction of a unit vector \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is given by:
\[
D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f((0,0) + h\mathbf{u}) - f(0,0)}{h}
\]

Substituting \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we evaluate \( f \) at the point \(( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} )\):

1. **Check the denominator \( x^2 - y^2 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^2 = \frac{16h^2}{25} - \frac{9h^2}{25} = \frac{7h^2}{25} \neq 0 \text{ for } h \neq 0
   \]

2. **Compute the numerator \( x^3 + y^3 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^3 + \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^3 = \frac{64h^3}{125} + \frac{27h^3}{125} = \frac{91h^3}{125}
   \]

3. **Evaluate \( f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) \):**
   \[
   f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) = \frac{\frac{91h^3}{125}}{\frac{7h^2}{25}} = \frac{91h^3}{125} \times \frac{25}{7h^2} = \frac{91h \times 25}{125 \times 7} = \frac{13h}{5}
   \]

4. **Compute the directional derivative:**
   \[
   D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{13h}{5}}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{13}{5} = \frac{13}{5}
   \]

Thus, the directional derivative of the function at \((0,0)\) in the direction of \(\langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}\).          </p>

Response: (In terms of x and y, the partial derivative of a function with respect to x is to be found by holding all other variables constant and taking the ordinary derivative.)

Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the directional derivative of this piecewise function at (0,0) in the direction of the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩. Let me start by recalling what a directional derivative is. The directional derivative of a function f at a point P in the direction of a unit vector u is the rate at which f changes at P in the direction u. The formula for it is the dot product of the gradient of f at P and the unit vector u. But wait, does this function have a gradient at (0,0)? Hmm, the function is defined piecewise, with the value 0 at (0,0) since x² - y² = 0 there. For other points where x² - y² ≠ 0, it&#x27;s (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

First, I need to check if the function is differentiable at (0,0). If it isn&#x27;t, then the gradient might not exist, and I can&#x27;t use the standard gradient formula. Alternatively, even if the gradient doesn&#x27;t exist, the directional derivative might still exist using the limit definition. The directional derivative D_u f(0,0) can be computed as the limit as h approaches 0 of [f((0,0) + h*u) - f(0,0)] / h. Since f(0,0) is 0, that simplifies to the limit as h approaches 0 of f(h*(4/5), h*(3/5)) / h.

So maybe I should use this limit definition directly? Let&#x27;s try that. Let me set up the limit. The direction vector is ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which is already a unit vector because (4/5)² + (3/5)² = 16/25 + 9/25 = 25/25 = 1. So I don&#x27;t need to normalize it. Then, moving along this direction from (0,0), the point after a step h is (4h/5, 3h/5). Now, I need to compute f at this point and then divide by h, taking the limit as h approaches 0.

So let&#x27;s compute f(4h/5, 3h/5). First, check if x² - y² ≠ 0. Let&#x27;s compute x² - y² at (4h/5, 3h/5):

x² - y² = (4h/5)² - (3h/5)² = (16h²/25) - (9h²/25) = 7h²/25. Since h ≠ 0 (we&#x27;re taking the limit as h approaches 0), this is not zero. Therefore, we use the first case of f: (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

So compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = (64h³/125) + (27h³/125) = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = 7h²/25 as above.

Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91h³/125) * (25/(7h²)) = (91h * 25) / (125 * 7) = (91h * 5) / (25 * 7) [because 25/125 = 1/5] Wait, maybe simplifying step by step:

First, 91/7 = 13, so 91 divided by 7 is 13. Then, 25/125 = 1/5. So:

(91/7)*(25/125)*h = 13*(1/5)*h = (13/5)h. Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (13/5)h.

Then, the directional derivative is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(4h/5, 3h/5)] / h = (13/5 h) / h = 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Wait, let&#x27;s verify the calculations again step by step to be sure.

First, substituting x = 4h/5, y = 3h/5.

Compute numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3. Let&#x27;s compute each term:

(4h/5)^3 = 64h³ / 125

(3h/5)^3 = 27h³ / 125

Sum: 64 + 27 = 91, so numerator is 91h³ / 125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (4h/5)^2 - (3h/5)^2 = 16h²/25 - 9h²/25 = 7h²/25.

Thus, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/125)/(7/25) * h = (91/125)*(25/7) * h = (91*25)/(125*7) * h. Simplify 25/125 = 1/5, and 91/7 =13. So 13 * 1/5 = 13/5. Therefore, f(x,y) = (13/5)h.

Then, [f(h) - f(0,0)] / h = (13/5 h - 0)/h = 13/5. So the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5, which exists. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5.

Wait, but I should check if there are any issues with approaching from different directions. But since we are approaching along the specific direction given by the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which parametrizes the line through (0,0) in that direction, the calculation seems valid. Since the limit exists, the directional derivative exists and is 13/5.

But let me think again: sometimes functions can have directional derivatives in all directions but still not be differentiable at a point. However, the question here only asks for the directional derivative in this specific direction, so even if the function isn&#x27;t differentiable at (0,0), as long as the limit exists along this direction, that&#x27;s the answer. 

Is there a possibility that the limit doesn&#x27;t exist here? Let me see. The expression simplified neatly to 13/5 h over h, so 13/5, which is a constant, so the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5. So that&#x27;s straightforward. Therefore, I think the directional derivative is 13/5.

But let me confirm once more. Another way is to parametrize the direction. Let’s suppose we approach along the direction (4/5, 3/5). So we can write x = 4t/5 and y = 3t/5, where t is a parameter approaching 0. Then f(x,y) = [ ( (4t/5)^3 + (3t/5)^3 ) / ( (4t/5)^2 - (3t/5)^2 ) ] = [ (64t³ + 27t³)/125 ] / [ (16t² - 9t²)/25 ] = [91t³/125] / [7t²/25] = (91t³/125) * (25/7t²) = (91*25)/(125*7) * t = (91/35) * (25/125) * t. Wait, but 91/35 is 13/5, since 35*2=70, 91-70=21, 35*2.6=91? Wait, no. Wait 35*2 = 70, 35*2.6 = 70 + 35*0.6 = 70 + 21 = 91. So 91/35 = 2.6, which is 13/5. And 25/125 = 1/5. Wait, no, actually, (91/125)*(25/7) = (91/7)*(25/125) = 13*(1/5) = 13/5. Therefore, it&#x27;s 13/5 * t. Then, [f(t) - f(0)] / t = (13/5 t - 0)/t = 13/5. So same result. So yes, the directional derivative is 13/5. 

Alternatively, if I use the definition of directional derivative: D_u f(0,0) = lim_{h→0} [f(0 + h*(4/5), 0 + h*(3/5)) - f(0,0)] / h. Which is exactly what I computed. So this seems consistent.

Wait, but another thought: since the function is defined as 0 at (0,0), which is on the line x² - y² =0, which at (0,0) is just the origin. But when approaching along the direction (4/5, 3/5), the path x=4h/5, y=3h/5 is such that x² - y² =7h²/25 ≠0 for h≠0, so we are approaching along a path that stays in the region where f is defined by (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). Therefore, the calculation is valid. If we had approached along a direction where x² - y² =0, like along y = x or y = -x, then we would have different behavior. But here, the direction is such that x² - y² ≠0 along that path (except at h=0). Therefore, the limit only involves the expression (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²), which simplifies to 13/5 as h approaches 0.

Therefore, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/7)*(h³/h²)*(25/125) =13*(h)*(1/5)=13h/5. Then, [f(x,y) - 0]/h = (13h/5)/h =13/5. Yep, that&#x27;s consistent.

So, even after multiple checks, the answer seems to be 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative at (0,0) in the direction ⟨4/5,3/5⟩ is 13/5.

To find the directional derivative of the function \( f(x,y) = \begin{cases}\frac{x^3+y^3}{x^2-y^2},\ x^2-y^2\neq 0 \\ 0, \ x^2-y^2=0\end{cases} \) at the point \((0,0)\) in the direction of the vector \(\langle\frac{4}{5},\frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we use the limit definition of the directional derivative.

The directional derivative \( D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) \) in the direction of a unit vector \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is given by:
\[
D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f((0,0) + h\mathbf{u}) - f(0,0)}{h}
\]

Substituting \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we evaluate \( f \) at the point \(( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} )\):

1. **Check the denominator \( x^2 - y^2 \):**

   \]

2. **Compute the numerator \( x^3 + y^3 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^3 + \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^3 = \frac{64h^3}{125} + \frac{27h^3}{125} = \frac{91h^3}{125}
   \]

3. **Evaluate \( f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) \):**
   \[
   f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) = \frac{\frac{91h^3}{125}}{\frac{7h^2}{25}} = \frac{91h^3}{125} \times \frac{25}{7h^2} = \frac{91h \times 25}{125 \times 7} = \frac{13h}{5}

Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the directional derivative of this piecewise function at (0,0) in the direction of the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩. Let me start by recalling what a directional derivative is. The directional derivative of a function f at a point P in the direction of a unit vector u is the rate at which f changes at P in the direction u. The formula for it is the dot product of the gradient of f at P and the unit vector u. But wait, does this function have a gradient at (0,0)? Hmm, the function is defined piecewise, with the value 0 at (0,0) since x² - y² = 0 there. For other points where x² - y² ≠ 0, it&#x27;s (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

First, I need to check if the function is differentiable at (0,0). If it isn&#x27;t, then the gradient might not exist, and I can&#x27;t use the standard gradient formula. Alternatively, even if the gradient doesn&#x27;t exist, the directional derivative might still exist using the limit definition. The directional derivative D_u f(0,0) can be computed as the limit as h approaches 0 of [f((0,0) + h*u) - f(0,0)] / h. Since f(0,0) is 0, that simplifies to the limit as h approaches 0 of f(h*(4/5), h*(3/5)) / h.

So maybe I should use this limit definition directly? Let&#x27;s try that. Let me set up the limit. The direction vector is ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which is already a unit vector because (4/5)² + (3/5)² = 16/25 + 9/25 = 25/25 = 1. So I don&#x27;t need to normalize it. Then, moving along this direction from (0,0), the point after a step h is (4h/5, 3h/5). Now, I need to compute f at this point and then divide by h, taking the limit as h approaches 0.

So let&#x27;s compute f(4h/5, 3h/5). First, check if x² - y² ≠ 0. Let&#x27;s compute x² - y² at (4h/5, 3h/5):

x² - y² = (4h/5)² - (3h/5)² = (16h²/25) - (9h²/25) = 7h²/25. Since h ≠ 0 (we&#x27;re taking the limit as h approaches 0), this is not zero. Therefore, we use the first case of f: (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

So compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = (64h³/125) + (27h³/125) = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = 7h²/25 as above.

Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91h³/125) * (25/(7h²)) = (91h * 25) / (125 * 7) = (91h * 5) / (25 * 7) [because 25/125 = 1/5] Wait, maybe simplifying step by step:

First, 91/7 = 13, so 91 divided by 7 is 13. Then, 25/125 = 1/5. So:

(91/7)*(25/125)*h = 13*(1/5)*h = (13/5)h. Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (13/5)h.

Then, the directional derivative is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(4h/5, 3h/5)] / h = (13/5 h) / h = 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Wait, let&#x27;s verify the calculations again step by step to be sure.

First, substituting x = 4h/5, y = 3h/5.

Compute numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3. Let&#x27;s compute each term:

(4h/5)^3 = 64h³ / 125

(3h/5)^3 = 27h³ / 125

Sum: 64 + 27 = 91, so numerator is 91h³ / 125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (4h/5)^2 - (3h/5)^2 = 16h²/25 - 9h²/25 = 7h²/25.

Thus, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/125)/(7/25) * h = (91/125)*(25/7) * h = (91*25)/(125*7) * h. Simplify 25/125 = 1/5, and 91/7 =13. So 13 * 1/5 = 13/5. Therefore, f(x,y) = (13/5)h.

Then, [f(h) - f(0,0)] / h = (13/5 h - 0)/h = 13/5. So the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5, which exists. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5.

Wait, but I should check if there are any issues with approaching from different directions. But since we are approaching along the specific direction given by the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which parametrizes the line through (0,0) in that direction, the calculation seems valid. Since the limit exists, the directional derivative exists and is 13/5.

But let me think again: sometimes functions can have directional derivatives in all directions but still not be differentiable at a point. However, the question here only asks for the directional derivative in this specific direction, so even if the function isn&#x27;t differentiable at (0,0), as long as the limit exists along this direction, that&#x27;s the answer. 

Is there a possibility that the limit doesn&#x27;t exist here? Let me see. The expression simplified neatly to 13/5 h over h, so 13/5, which is a constant, so the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5. So that&#x27;s straightforward. Therefore, I think the directional derivative is 13/5.

But let me confirm once more. Another way is to parametrize the direction. Let’s suppose we approach along the direction (4/5, 3/5). So we can write x = 4t/5 and y = 3t/5, where t is a parameter approaching 0. Then f(x,y) = [ ( (4t/5)^3 + (3t/5)^3 ) / ( (4t/5)^2 - (3t/5)^2 ) ] = [ (64t³ + 27t³)/125 ] / [ (16t² - 9t²)/25 ] = [91t³/125] / [7t²/25] = (91t³/125) * (25/7t²) = (91*25)/(125*7) * t = (91/35) * (25/125) * t. Wait, but 91/35 is 13/5, since 35*2=70, 91-70=21, 35*2.6=91? Wait, no. Wait 35*2 = 70, 35*2.6 = 70 + 35*0.6 = 70 + 21 = 91. So 91/35 = 2.6, which is 13/5. And 25/125 = 1/5. Wait, no, actually, (91/125)*(25/7) = (91/7)*(25/125) = 13*(1/5) = 13/5. Therefore, it&#x27;s 13/5 * t. Then, [f(t) - f(0)] / t = (13/5 t - 0)/t = 13/5. So same result. So yes, the directional derivative is 13/5. 

Alternatively, if I use the definition of directional derivative: D_u f(0,0) = lim_{h→0} [f(0 + h*(4/5), 0 + h*(3/5)) - f(0,0)] / h. Which is exactly what I computed. So this seems consistent.

Wait, but another thought: since the function is defined as 0 at (0,0), which is on the line x² - y² =0, which at (0,0) is just the origin. But when approaching along the direction (4/5, 3/5), the path x=4h/5, y=3h/5 is such that x² - y² =7h²/25 ≠0 for h≠0, so we are approaching along a path that stays in the region where f is defined by (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). Therefore, the calculation is valid. If we had approached along a direction where x² - y² =0, like along y = x or y = -x, then we would have different behavior. But here, the direction is such that x² - y² ≠0 along that path (except at h=0). Therefore, the limit only involves the expression (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²), which simplifies to 13/5 as h approaches 0.

Therefore, I think the answer is 13/5. Let me check if I made a mistake in simplifying fractions. Let&#x27;s go through the computation again:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = 64h³/125 + 27h³/125 = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (16h²/25 -9h²/25) =7h²/25.

Therefore, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/7)*(h³/h²)*(25/125) =13*(h)*(1/5)=13h/5. Then, [f(x,y) - 0]/h = (13h/5)/h =13/5. Yep, that&#x27;s consistent.

So, even after multiple checks, the answer seems to be 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative at (0,0) in the direction ⟨4/5,3/5⟩ is 13/5.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the directional derivative of the function \( f(x,y) = \begin{cases}\frac{x^3+y^3}{x^2-y^2},\ x^2-y^2\neq 0 \\ 0, \ x^2-y^2=0\end{cases} \) at the point \((0,0)\) in the direction of the vector \(\langle\frac{4}{5},\frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we use the limit definition of the directional derivative.

The directional derivative \( D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) \) in the direction of a unit vector \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is given by:
\[
D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f((0,0) + h\mathbf{u}) - f(0,0)}{h}
\]

Substituting \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we evaluate \( f \) at the point \(( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} )\):

1. **Check the denominator \( x^2 - y^2 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^2 = \frac{16h^2}{25} - \frac{9h^2}{25} = \frac{7h^2}{25} \neq 0 \text{ for } h \neq 0
   \]

2. **Compute the numerator \( x^3 + y^3 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^3 + \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^3 = \frac{64h^3}{125} + \frac{27h^3}{125} = \frac{91h^3}{125}
   \]

3. **Evaluate \( f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) \):**
   \[
   f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) = \frac{\frac{91h^3}{125}}{\frac{7h^2}{25}} = \frac{91h^3}{125} \times \frac{25}{7h^2} = \frac{91h \times 25}{125 \times 7} = \frac{13h}{5}
   \]

4. **Compute the directional derivative:**
   \[
   D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{13h}{5}}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{13}{5} = \frac{13}{5}
   \]

Thus, the directional derivative of the function at \((0,0)\) in the direction of \(\langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}\).          </p>

Response: First we need to figure out the slope of a line we can draw to approximate the function. To do this we can substitute other values for variables. Try a common test value for each variable, like 1 or 2. \(\frac{\frac{1^3+1^3}{1^2-1^2}}{1^2-1^2}\,\text{or}\,\,\frac{\frac12+\frac24}{1-1}\) The common test inputs are the same, but the calculations vary because the function is not defined at the line manipulated. We can make better approximations by changing the value of the variables closer to the origin. Use the values from your first test inputs, and for the variables use the common value of 0. Since the straight line \(y=mx\) is just one degree of freedom, we can use any value we want for \(x\), but we have to change \(y\) appropriately to get a line passing through the 0. We find \(y=mx\) works at \(x=0--&gt;y=0\). Now we have value to sub for the variables, \(f(0,0)=0\). As for the slope, because \(m=0\), we have the slope as 0. \(\boxed{0}\)          </p>

Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the directional derivative of this piecewise function at (0,0) in the direction of the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩. Let me start by recalling what a directional derivative is. The directional derivative of a function f at a point P in the direction of a unit vector u is the rate at which f changes at P in the direction u. The formula for it is the dot product of the gradient of f at P and the unit vector u. But wait, does this function have a gradient at (0,0)? Hmm, the function is defined piecewise, with the value 0 at (0,0) since x² - y² = 0 there. For other points where x² - y² ≠ 0, it&#x27;s (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

First, I need to check if the function is differentiable at (0,0). If it isn&#x27;t, then the gradient might not exist, and I can&#x27;t use the standard gradient formula. Alternatively, even if the gradient doesn&#x27;t exist, the directional derivative might still exist using the limit definition. The directional derivative D_u f(0,0) can be computed as the limit as h approaches 0 of [f((0,0) + h*u) - f(0,0)] / h. Since f(0,0) is 0, that simplifies to the limit as h approaches 0 of f(h*(4/5), h*(3/5)) / h.

So maybe I should use this limit definition directly? Let&#x27;s try that. Let me set up the limit. The direction vector is ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which is already a unit vector because (4/5)² + (3/5)² = 16/25 + 9/25 = 25/25 = 1. So I don&#x27;t need to normalize it. Then, moving along this direction from (0,0), the point after a step h is (4h/5, 3h/5). Now, I need to compute f at this point and then divide by h, taking the limit as h approaches 0.

So let&#x27;s compute f(4h/5, 3h/5). First, check if x² - y² ≠ 0. Let&#x27;s compute x² - y² at (4h/5, 3h/5):

x² - y² = (4h/5)² - (3h/5)² = (16h²/25) - (9h²/25) = 7h²/25. Since h ≠ 0 (we&#x27;re taking the limit as h approaches 0), this is not zero. Therefore, we use the first case of f: (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

So compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = (64h³/125) + (27h³/125) = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = 7h²/25 as above.

Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91h³/125) * (25/(7h²)) = (91h * 25) / (125 * 7) = (91h * 5) / (25 * 7) [because 25/125 = 1/5] Wait, maybe simplifying step by step:

First, 91/7 = 13, so 91 divided by 7 is 13. Then, 25/125 = 1/5. So:

(91/7)*(25/125)*h = 13*(1/5)*h = (13/5)h. Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (13/5)h.

Then, the directional derivative is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(4h/5, 3h/5)] / h = (13/5 h) / h = 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Wait, let&#x27;s verify the calculations again step by step to be sure.

First, substituting x = 4h/5, y = 3h/5.

Compute numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3. Let&#x27;s compute each term:

(4h/5)^3 = 64h³ / 125

(3h/5)^3 = 27h³ / 125

Sum: 64 + 27 = 91, so numerator is 91h³ / 125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (4h/5)^2 - (3h/5)^2 = 16h²/25 - 9h²/25 = 7h²/25.

Thus, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/125)/(7/25) * h = (91/125)*(25/7) * h = (91*25)/(125*7) * h. Simplify 25/125 = 1/5, and 91/7 =13. So 13 * 1/5 = 13/5. Therefore, f(x,y) = (13/5)h.

Then, [f(h) - f(0,0)] / h = (13/5 h - 0)/h = 13/5. So the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5, which exists. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5.

Wait, but I should check if there are any issues with approaching from different directions. But since we are approaching along the specific direction given by the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which parametrizes the line through (0,0) in that direction, the calculation seems valid. Since the limit exists, the directional derivative exists and is 13/5.

But let me think again: sometimes functions can have directional derivatives in all directions but still not be differentiable at a point. However, the question here only asks for the directional derivative in this specific direction, so even if the function isn&#x27;t differentiable at (0,0), as long as the limit exists along this direction, that&#x27;s the answer. 

Is there a possibility that the limit doesn&#x27;t exist here? Let me see. The expression simplified neatly to 13/5 h over h, so 13/5, which is a constant, so the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5. So that&#x27;s straightforward. Therefore, I think the directional derivative is 13/5.

But let me confirm once more. Another way is to parametrize the direction. Let’s suppose we approach along the direction (4/5, 3/5). So we can write x = 4t/5 and y = 3t/5, where t is a parameter approaching 0. Then f(x,y) = [ ( (4t/5)^3 + (3t/5)^3 ) / ( (4t/5)^2 - (3t/5)^2 ) ] = [ (64t³ + 27t³)/125 ] / [ (16t² - 9t²)/25 ] = [91t³/125] / [7t²/25] = (91t³/125) * (25/7t²) = (91*25)/(125*7) * t = (91/35) * (25/125) * t. Wait, but 91/35 is 13/5, since 35*2=70, 91-70=21, 35*2.6=91? Wait, no. Wait 35*2 = 70, 35*2.6 = 70 + 35*0.6 = 70 + 21 = 91. So 91/35 = 2.6, which is 13/5. And 25/125 = 1/5. Wait, no, actually, (91/125)*(25/7) = (91/7)*(25/125) = 13*(1/5) = 13/5. Therefore, it&#x27;s 13/5 * t. Then, [f(t) - f(0)] / t = (13/5 t - 0)/t = 13/5. So same result. So yes, the directional derivative is 13/5. 

Alternatively, if I use the definition of directional derivative: D_u f(0,0) = lim_{h→0} [f(0 + h*(4/5), 0 + h*(3/5)) - f(0,0)] / h. Which is exactly what I computed. So this seems consistent.

Wait, but another thought: since the function is defined as 0 at (0,0), which is on the line x² - y² =0, which at (0,0) is just the origin. But when approaching along the direction (4/5, 3/5), the path x=4h/5, y=3h/5 is such that x² - y² =7h²/25 ≠0 for h≠0, so we are approaching along a path that stays in the region where f is defined by (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). Therefore, the calculation is valid. If we had approached along a direction where x² - y² =0, like along y = x or y = -x, then we would have different behavior. But here, the direction is such that x² - y² ≠0 along that path (except at h=0). Therefore, the limit only involves the expression (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²), which simplifies to 13/5 as h approaches 0.

Therefore, I think the answer is 13/5. Let me check if I made a mistake in simplifying fractions. Let&#x27;s go through the computation again:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = 64h³/125 + 27h³/125 = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (16h²/25 -9h²/25) =7h²/25.

Therefore, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/7)*(h³/h²)*(25/125) =13*(h)*(1/5)=13h/5. Then, [f(x,y) - 0]/h = (13h/5)/h =13/5. Yep, that&#x27;s consistent.

So, even after multiple checks, the answer seems to be 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative at (0,0) in the direction ⟨4/5,3/5⟩ is 13/5.

To find the directional derivative of the function \( f(x,y) = \begin{cases}\frac{x^3+y^3}{x^2-y^2},\ x^2-y^2\neq 0 \\ 0, \ x^2-y^2=0\end{cases} \) at the point \((0,0)\) in the direction of the vector \(\langle\frac{4}{5},\frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we use the limit definition of the directional derivative.

The directional derivative \( D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) \) in the direction of a unit vector \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is given by:
\[
D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f((0,0) + h\mathbf{u}) - f(0,0)}{h}
\]

Substituting \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we evaluate \( f \) at the point \(( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} )\):

1. **Check the denominator \( x^2 - y^2 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^2 = \frac{16h^2}{25} - \frac{9h^2}{25} = \frac{7h^2}{25} \neq 0 \text{ for } h \neq 0
   \]

2. **Compute the numerator \( x^3 + y^3 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^3 + \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^3 = \frac{64h^3}{125} + \frac{27h^3}{125} = \frac{91h^3}{125}
   \]

3. **Evaluate \( f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) \):**
   \[
   f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) = \frac{\frac{91h^3}{125}}{\frac{7h^2}{25}} = \frac{91h^3}{125} \times \frac{25}{7h^2} = \frac{91h \times 25}{125 \times 7} = \frac{13h}{5}
   \]

4. **Compute the directional derivative:**
   \[
   D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{13h}{5}}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{13}{5} = \frac{13}{5}
   \]

Thus, the directional derivative of the function at \((0,0)\) in the direction of \(\langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the directional derivative of this piecewise function at (0,0) in the direction of the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩. Let me start by recalling what a directional derivative is. The directional derivative of a function f at a point P in the direction of a unit vector u is the rate at which f changes at P in the direction u. The formula for it is the dot product of the gradient of f at P and the unit vector u. But wait, does this function have a gradient at (0,0)? Hmm, the function is defined piecewise, with the value 0 at (0,0) since x² - y² = 0 there. For other points where x² - y² ≠ 0, it&#x27;s (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

First, I need to check if the function is differentiable at (0,0). If it isn&#x27;t, then the gradient might not exist, and I can&#x27;t use the standard gradient formula. Alternatively, even if the gradient doesn&#x27;t exist, the directional derivative might still exist using the limit definition. The directional derivative D_u f(0,0) can be computed as the limit as h approaches 0 of [f((0,0) + h*u) - f(0,0)] / h. Since f(0,0) is 0, that simplifies to the limit as h approaches 0 of f(h*(4/5), h*(3/5)) / h.

So maybe I should use this limit definition directly? Let&#x27;s try that. Let me set up the limit. The direction vector is ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which is already a unit vector because (4/5)² + (3/5)² = 16/25 + 9/25 = 25/25 = 1. So I don&#x27;t need to normalize it. Then, moving along this direction from (0,0), the point after a step h is (4h/5, 3h/5). Now, I need to compute f at this point and then divide by h, taking the limit as h approaches 0.

So let&#x27;s compute f(4h/5, 3h/5). First, check if x² - y² ≠ 0. Let&#x27;s compute x² - y² at (4h/5, 3h/5):

x² - y² = (4h/5)² - (3h/5)² = (16h²/25) - (9h²/25) = 7h²/25. Since h ≠ 0 (we&#x27;re taking the limit as h approaches 0), this is not zero. Therefore, we use the first case of f: (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

So compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = (64h³/125) + (27h³/125) = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = 7h²/25 as above.

Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91h³/125) * (25/(7h²)) = (91h * 25) / (125 * 7) = (91h * 5) / (25 * 7) [because 25/125 = 1/5] Wait, maybe simplifying step by step:

First, 91/7 = 13, so 91 divided by 7 is 13. Then, 25/125 = 1/5. So:

(91/7)*(25/125)*h = 13*(1/5)*h = (13/5)h. Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (13/5)h.

Then, the directional derivative is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(4h/5, 3h/5)] / h = (13/5 h) / h = 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Wait, let&#x27;s verify the calculations again step by step to be sure.

First, substituting x = 4h/5, y = 3h/5.

Compute numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3. Let&#x27;s compute each term:

(4h/5)^3 = 64h³ / 125

(3h/5)^3 = 27h³ / 125

Sum: 64 + 27 = 91, so numerator is 91h³ / 125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (4h/5)^2 - (3h/5)^2 = 16h²/25 - 9h²/25 = 7h²/25.

Thus, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/125)/(7/25) * h = (91/125)*(25/7) * h = (91*25)/(125*7) * h. Simplify 25/125 = 1/5, and 91/7 =13. So 13 * 1/5 = 13/5. Therefore, f(x,y) = (13/5)h.

Then, [f(h) - f(0,0)] / h = (13/5 h - 0)/h = 13/5. So the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5, which exists. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5.

Wait, but I should check if there are any issues with approaching from different directions. But since we are approaching along the specific direction given by the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which parametrizes the line through (0,0) in that direction, the calculation seems valid. Since the limit exists, the directional derivative exists and is 13/5.

But let me think again: sometimes functions can have directional derivatives in all directions but still not be differentiable at a point. However, the question here only asks for the directional derivative in this specific direction, so even if the function isn&#x27;t differentiable at (0,0), as long as the limit exists along this direction, that&#x27;s the answer. 

Is there a possibility that the limit doesn&#x27;t exist here? Let me see. The expression simplified neatly to 13/5 h over h, so 13/5, which is a constant, so the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5. So that&#x27;s straightforward. Therefore, I think the directional derivative is 13/5.

But let me confirm once more. Another way is to parametrize the direction. Let’s suppose we approach along the direction (4/5, 3/5). So we can write x = 4t/5 and y = 3t/5, where t is a parameter approaching 0. Then f(x,y) = [ ( (4t/5)^3 + (3t/5)^3 ) / ( (4t/5)^2 - (3t/5)^2 ) ] = [ (64t³ + 27t³)/125 ] / [ (16t² - 9t²)/25 ] = [91t³/125] / [7t²/25] = (91t³/125) * (25/7t²) = (91*25)/(125*7) * t = (91/35) * (25/125) * t. Wait, but 91/35 is 13/5, since 35*2=70, 91-70=21, 35*2.6=91? Wait, no. Wait 35*2 = 70, 35*2.6 = 70 + 35*0.6 = 70 + 21 = 91. So 91/35 = 2.6, which is 13/5. And 25/125 = 1/5. Wait, no, actually, (91/125)*(25/7) = (91/7)*(25/125) = 13*(1/5) = 13/5. Therefore, it&#x27;s 13/5 * t. Then, [f(t) - f(0)] / t = (13/5 t - 0)/t = 13/5. So same result. So yes, the directional derivative is 13/5. 

Alternatively, if I use the definition of directional derivative: D_u f(0,0) = lim_{h→0} [f(0 + h*(4/5), 0 + h*(3/5)) - f(0,0)] / h. Which is exactly what I computed. So this seems consistent.

Wait, but another thought: since the function is defined as 0 at (0,0), which is on the line x² - y² =0, which at (0,0) is just the origin. But when approaching along the direction (4/5, 3/5), the path x=4h/5, y=3h/5 is such that x² - y² =7h²/25 ≠0 for h≠0, so we are approaching along a path that stays in the region where f is defined by (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). Therefore, the calculation is valid. If we had approached along a direction where x² - y² =0, like along y = x or y = -x, then we would have different behavior. But here, the direction is such that x² - y² ≠0 along that path (except at h=0). Therefore, the limit only involves the expression (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²), which simplifies to 13/5 as h approaches 0.

Therefore, I think the answer is 13/5. Let me check if I made a mistake in simplifying fractions. Let&#x27;s go through the computation again:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = 64h³/125 + 27h³/125 = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (16h²/25 -9h²/25) =7h²/25.

Therefore, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/7)*(h³/h²)*(25/125) =13*(h)*(1/5)=13h/5. Then, [f(x,y) - 0]/h = (13h/5)/h =13/5. Yep, that&#x27;s consistent.

So, even after multiple checks, the answer seems to be 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative at (0,0) in the direction ⟨4/5,3/5⟩ is 13/5.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the directional derivative of the function \( f(x,y) = \begin{cases}\frac{x^3+y^3}{x^2-y^2},\ x^2-y^2\neq 0 \\ 0, \ x^2-y^2=0\end{cases} \) at the point \((0,0)\) in the direction of the vector \(\langle\frac{4}{5},\frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we use the limit definition of the directional derivative.

The directional derivative \( D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) \) in the direction of a unit vector \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is given by:
\[
D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f((0,0) + h\mathbf{u}) - f(0,0)}{h}
\]

Substituting \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we evaluate \( f \) at the point \(( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} )\):

1. **Check the denominator \( x^2 - y^2 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^2 = \frac{16h^2}{25} - \frac{9h^2}{25} = \frac{7h^2}{25} \neq 0 \text{ for } h \neq 0
   \]

2. **Compute the numerator \( x^3 + y^3 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^3 + \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^3 = \frac{64h^3}{125} + \frac{27h^3}{125} = \frac{91h^3}{125}
   \]

3. **Evaluate \( f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) \):**
   \[
   f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) = \frac{\frac{91h^3}{125}}{\frac{7h^2}{25}} = \frac{91h^3}{125} \times \frac{25}{7h^2} = \frac{91h \times 25}{125 \times 7} = \frac{13h}{5}
   \]

4. **Compute the directional derivative:**
   \[
   D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{13h}{5}}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{13}{5} = \frac{13}{5}
   \]

Thus, the directional derivative of the function at \((0,0)\) in the direction of \(\langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the directional derivative of this piecewise function at (0,0) in the direction of the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩. Let me start by recalling what a directional derivative is. The directional derivative of a function f at a point P in the direction of a unit vector u is the rate at which f changes at P in the direction u. The formula for it is the dot product of the gradient of f at P and the unit vector u. But wait, does this function have a gradient at (0,0)? Hmm, the function is defined piecewise, with the value 0 at (0,0) since x² - y² = 0 there. For other points where x² - y² ≠ 0, it&#x27;s (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

First, I need to check if the function is differentiable at (0,0). If it isn&#x27;t, then the gradient might not exist, and I can&#x27;t use the standard gradient formula. Alternatively, even if the gradient doesn&#x27;t exist, the directional derivative might still exist using the limit definition. The directional derivative D_u f(0,0) can be computed as the limit as h approaches 0 of [f((0,0) + h*u) - f(0,0)] / h. Since f(0,0) is 0, that simplifies to the limit as h approaches 0 of f(h*(4/5), h*(3/5)) / h.

So maybe I should use this limit definition directly? Let&#x27;s try that. Let me set up the limit. The direction vector is ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which is already a unit vector because (4/5)² + (3/5)² = 16/25 + 9/25 = 25/25 = 1. So I don&#x27;t need to normalize it. Then, moving along this direction from (0,0), the point after a step h is (4h/5, 3h/5). Now, I need to compute f at this point and then divide by h, taking the limit as h approaches 0.

So let&#x27;s compute f(4h/5, 3h/5). First, check if x² - y² ≠ 0. Let&#x27;s compute x² - y² at (4h/5, 3h/5):

x² - y² = (4h/5)² - (3h/5)² = (16h²/25) - (9h²/25) = 7h²/25. Since h ≠ 0 (we&#x27;re taking the limit as h approaches 0), this is not zero. Therefore, we use the first case of f: (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

So compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = (64h³/125) + (27h³/125) = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = 7h²/25 as above.

Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91h³/125) * (25/(7h²)) = (91h * 25) / (125 * 7) = (91h * 5) / (25 * 7) [because 25/125 = 1/5] Wait, maybe simplifying step by step:

First, 91/7 = 13, so 91 divided by 7 is 13. Then, 25/125 = 1/5. So:

(91/7)*(25/125)*h = 13*(1/5)*h = (13/5)h. Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (13/5)h.

Then, the directional derivative is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(4h/5, 3h/5)] / h = (13/5 h) / h = 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Wait, let&#x27;s verify the calculations again step by step to be sure.

First, substituting x = 4h/5, y = 3h/5.

Compute numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3. Let&#x27;s compute each term:

(4h/5)^3 = 64h³ / 125

(3h/5)^3 = 27h³ / 125

Sum: 64 + 27 = 91, so numerator is 91h³ / 125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (4h/5)^2 - (3h/5)^2 = 16h²/25 - 9h²/25 = 7h²/25.

Thus, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/125)/(7/25) * h = (91/125)*(25/7) * h = (91*25)/(125*7) * h. Simplify 25/125 = 1/5, and 91/7 =13. So 13 * 1/5 = 13/5. Therefore, f(x,y) = (13/5)h.

Then, [f(h) - f(0,0)] / h = (13/5 h - 0)/h = 13/5. So the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5, which exists. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5.

Wait, but I should check if there are any issues with approaching from different directions. But since we are approaching along the specific direction given by the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which parametrizes the line through (0,0) in that direction, the calculation seems valid. Since the limit exists, the directional derivative exists and is 13/5.

But let me think again: sometimes functions can have directional derivatives in all directions but still not be differentiable at a point. However, the question here only asks for the directional derivative in this specific direction, so even if the function isn&#x27;t differentiable at (0,0), as long as the limit exists along this direction, that&#x27;s the answer. 

Is there a possibility that the limit doesn&#x27;t exist here? Let me see. The expression simplified neatly to 13/5 h over h, so 13/5, which is a constant, so the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5. So that&#x27;s straightforward. Therefore, I think the directional derivative is 13/5.

But let me confirm once more. Another way is to parametrize the direction. Let’s suppose we approach along the direction (4/5, 3/5). So we can write x = 4t/5 and y = 3t/5, where t is a parameter approaching 0. Then f(x,y) = [ ( (4t/5)^3 + (3t/5)^3 ) / ( (4t/5)^2 - (3t/5)^2 ) ] = [ (64t³ + 27t³)/125 ] / [ (16t² - 9t²)/25 ] = [91t³/125] / [7t²/25] = (91t³/125) * (25/7t²) = (91*25)/(125*7) * t = (91/35) * (25/125) * t. Wait, but 91/35 is 13/5, since 35*2=70, 91-70=21, 35*2.6=91? Wait, no. Wait 35*2 = 70, 35*2.6 = 70 + 35*0.6 = 70 + 21 = 91. So 91/35 = 2.6, which is 13/5. And 25/125 = 1/5. Wait, no, actually, (91/125)*(25/7) = (91/7)*(25/125) = 13*(1/5) = 13/5. Therefore, it&#x27;s 13/5 * t. Then, [f(t) - f(0)] / t = (13/5 t - 0)/t = 13/5. So same result. So yes, the directional derivative is 13/5. 

Alternatively, if I use the definition of directional derivative: D_u f(0,0) = lim_{h→0} [f(0 + h*(4/5), 0 + h*(3/5)) - f(0,0)] / h. Which is exactly what I computed. So this seems consistent.

Wait, but another thought: since the function is defined as 0 at (0,0), which is on the line x² - y² =0, which at (0,0) is just the origin. But when approaching along the direction (4/5, 3/5), the path x=4h/5, y=3h/5 is such that x² - y² =7h²/25 ≠0 for h≠0, so we are approaching along a path that stays in the region where f is defined by (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). Therefore, the calculation is valid. If we had approached along a direction where x² - y² =0, like along y = x or y = -x, then we would have different behavior. But here, the direction is such that x² - y² ≠0 along that path (except at h=0). Therefore, the limit only involves the expression (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²), which simplifies to 13/5 as h approaches 0.

Therefore, I think the answer is 13/5. Let me check if I made a mistake in simplifying fractions. Let&#x27;s go through the computation again:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = 64h³/125 + 27h³/125 = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (16h²/25 -9h²/25) =7h²/25.

Therefore, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/7)*(h³/h²)*(25/125) =13*(h)*(1/5)=13h/5. Then, [f(x,y) - 0]/h = (13h/5)/h =13/5. Yep, that&#x27;s consistent.

So, even after multiple checks, the answer seems to be 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative at (0,0) in the direction ⟨4/5,3/5⟩ is 13/5.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}

To find the directional derivative of the function \( f(x,y) = \begin{cases}\frac{x^3+y^3}{x^2-y^2},\ x^2-y^2\neq 0 \\ 0, \ x^2-y^2=0\end{cases} \) at the point \((0,0)\) in the direction of the vector \(\langle\frac{4}{5},\frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we use the limit definition of the directional derivative.

The directional derivative \( D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) \) in the direction of a unit vector \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is given by:
\[
D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f((0,0) + h\mathbf{u}) - f(0,0)}{h}
\]

Substituting \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we evaluate \( f \) at the point \(( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} )\):

1. **Check the denominator \( x^2 - y^2 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^2 = \frac{16h^2}{25} - \frac{9h^2}{25} = \frac{7h^2}{25} \neq 0 \text{ for } h \neq 0
   \]

2. **Compute the numerator \( x^3 + y^3 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^3 + \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^3 = \frac{64h^3}{125} + \frac{27h^3}{125} = \frac{91h^3}{125}
   \]

3. **Evaluate \( f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) \):**
   \[
   f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) = \frac{\frac{91h^3}{125}}{\frac{7h^2}{25}} = \frac{91h^3}{125} \times \frac{25}{7h^2} = \frac{91h \times 25}{125 \times 7} = \frac{13h}{5}
   \]

4. **Compute the directional derivative:**
   \[
   D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{13h}{5}}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{13}{5} = \frac{13}{5}
   \]

Thus, the directional derivative of the function at \((0,0)\) in the direction of \(\langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the directional derivative of this piecewise function at (0,0) in the direction of the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩. Let me start by recalling what a directional derivative is. The directional derivative of a function f at a point P in the direction of a unit vector u is the rate at which f changes at P in the direction u. The formula for it is the dot product of the gradient of f at P and the unit vector u. But wait, does this function have a gradient at (0,0)? Hmm, the function is defined piecewise, with the value 0 at (0,0) since x² - y² = 0 there. For other points where x² - y² ≠ 0, it&#x27;s (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

First, I need to check if the function is differentiable at (0,0). If it isn&#x27;t, then the gradient might not exist, and I can&#x27;t use the standard gradient formula. Alternatively, even if the gradient doesn&#x27;t exist, the directional derivative might still exist using the limit definition. The directional derivative D_u f(0,0) can be computed as the limit as h approaches 0 of [f((0,0) + h*u) - f(0,0)] / h. Since f(0,0) is 0, that simplifies to the limit as h approaches 0 of f(h*(4/5), h*(3/5)) / h.

So maybe I should use this limit definition directly? Let&#x27;s try that. Let me set up the limit. The direction vector is ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which is already a unit vector because (4/5)² + (3/5)² = 16/25 + 9/25 = 25/25 = 1. So I don&#x27;t need to normalize it. Then, moving along this direction from (0,0), the point after a step h is (4h/5, 3h/5). Now, I need to compute f at this point and then divide by h, taking the limit as h approaches 0.

So let&#x27;s compute f(4h/5, 3h/5). First, check if x² - y² ≠ 0. Let&#x27;s compute x² - y² at (4h/5, 3h/5):

x² - y² = (4h/5)² - (3h/5)² = (16h²/25) - (9h²/25) = 7h²/25. Since h ≠ 0 (we&#x27;re taking the limit as h approaches 0), this is not zero. Therefore, we use the first case of f: (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

So compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = (64h³/125) + (27h³/125) = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = 7h²/25 as above.

Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91h³/125) * (25/(7h²)) = (91h * 25) / (125 * 7) = (91h * 5) / (25 * 7) [because 25/125 = 1/5] Wait, maybe simplifying step by step:

First, 91/7 = 13, so 91 divided by 7 is 13. Then, 25/125 = 1/5. So:

(91/7)*(25/125)*h = 13*(1/5)*h = (13/5)h. Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (13/5)h.

Then, the directional derivative is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(4h/5, 3h/5)] / h = (13/5 h) / h = 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Wait, let&#x27;s verify the calculations again step by step to be sure.

First, substituting x = 4h/5, y = 3h/5.

Compute numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3. Let&#x27;s compute each term:

(4h/5)^3 = 64h³ / 125

(3h/5)^3 = 27h³ / 125

Sum: 64 + 27 = 91, so numerator is 91h³ / 125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (4h/5)^2 - (3h/5)^2 = 16h²/25 - 9h²/25 = 7h²/25.

Thus, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/125)/(7/25) * h = (91/125)*(25/7) * h = (91*25)/(125*7) * h. Simplify 25/125 = 1/5, and 91/7 =13. So 13 * 1/5 = 13/5. Therefore, f(x,y) = (13/5)h.

Then, [f(h) - f(0,0)] / h = (13/5 h - 0)/h = 13/5. So the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5, which exists. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5.

Wait, but I should check if there are any issues with approaching from different directions. But since we are approaching along the specific direction given by the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which parametrizes the line through (0,0) in that direction, the calculation seems valid. Since the limit exists, the directional derivative exists and is 13/5.

But let me think again: sometimes functions can have directional derivatives in all directions but still not be differentiable at a point. However, the question here only asks for the directional derivative in this specific direction, so even if the function isn&#x27;t differentiable at (0,0), as long as the limit exists along this direction, that&#x27;s the answer. 

Is there a possibility that the limit doesn&#x27;t exist here? Let me see. The expression simplified neatly to 13/5 h over h, so 13/5, which is a constant, so the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5. So that&#x27;s straightforward. Therefore, I think the directional derivative is 13/5.

But let me confirm once more. Another way is to parametrize the direction. Let’s suppose we approach along the direction (4/5, 3/5). So we can write x = 4t/5 and y = 3t/5, where t is a parameter approaching 0. Then f(x,y) = [ ( (4t/5)^3 + (3t/5)^3 ) / ( (4t/5)^2 - (3t/5)^2 ) ] = [ (64t³ + 27t³)/125 ] / [ (16t² - 9t²)/25 ] = [91t³/125] / [7t²/25] = (91t³/125) * (25/7t²) = (91*25)/(125*7) * t = (91/35) * (25/125) * t. Wait, but 91/35 is 13/5, since 35*2=70, 91-70=21, 35*2.6=91? Wait, no. Wait 35*2 = 70, 35*2.6 = 70 + 35*0.6 = 70 + 21 = 91. So 91/35 = 2.6, which is 13/5. And 25/125 = 1/5. Wait, no, actually, (91/125)*(25/7) = (91/7)*(25/125) = 13*(1/5) = 13/5. Therefore, it&#x27;s 13/5 * t. Then, [f(t) - f(0)] / t = (13/5 t - 0)/t = 13/5. So same result. So yes, the directional derivative is 13/5. 

Alternatively, if I use the definition of directional derivative: D_u f(0,0) = lim_{h→0} [f(0 + h*(4/5), 0 + h*(3/5)) - f(0,0)] / h. Which is exactly what I computed. So this seems consistent.

Wait, but another thought: since the function is defined as 0 at (0,0), which is on the line x² - y² =0, which at (0,0) is just the origin. But when approaching along the direction (4/5, 3/5), the path x=4h/5, y=3h/5 is such that x² - y² =7h²/25 ≠0 for h≠0, so we are approaching along a path that stays in the region where f is defined by (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). Therefore, the calculation is valid. If we had approached along a direction where x² - y² =0, like along y = x or y = -x, then we would have different behavior. But here, the direction is such that x² - y² ≠0 along that path (except at h=0). Therefore, the limit only involves the expression (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²), which simplifies to 13/5 as h approaches 0.

Therefore, I think the answer is 13/5. Let me check if I made a mistake in simplifying fractions. Let&#x27;s go through the computation again:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = 64h³/125 + 27h³/125 = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (16h²/25 -9h²/25) =7h²/25.

Therefore, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/7)*(h³/h²)*(25/125) =13*(h)*(1/5)=13h/5. Then, [f(x,y) - 0]/h = (13h/5)/h =13/5. Yep, that&#x27;s consistent.

So, even after multiple checks, the answer seems to be 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative at (0,0) in the direction ⟨4/5,3/5⟩ is 13/5.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the directional derivative of the function \( f(x,y) = \begin{cases}\frac{x^3+y^3}{x^2-y^2},\ x^2-y^2\neq 0 \\ 0, \ x^2-y^2=0\end{cases} \) at the point \((0,0)\) in the direction of the vector \(\langle\frac{4}{5},\frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we use the limit definition of the directional derivative.

The directional derivative \( D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) \) in the direction of a unit vector \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is given by:
\[
D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f((0,0) + h\mathbf{u}) - f(0,0)}{h}
\]

Substituting \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we evaluate \( f \) at the point \(( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} )\):

1. **Check the denominator \( x^2 - y^2 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^2 = \frac{16h^2}{25} - \frac{9h^2}{25} = \frac{7h^2}{25} \neq 0 \text{ for } h \neq 0
   \]

2. **Compute the numerator \( x^3 + y^3 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^3 + \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^3 = \frac{64h^3}{125} + \frac{27h^3}{125} = \frac{91h^3}{125}
   \]

3. **Evaluate \( f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) \):**
   \[
   f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) = \frac{\frac{91h^3}{125}}{\frac{7h^2}{25}} = \frac{91h^3}{125} \times \frac{25}{7h^2} = \frac{91h \times 25}{125 \times 7} = \frac{13h}{5}
   \]

4. **Compute the directional derivative:**
   \[
   D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{13h}{5}}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{13}{5} = \frac{13}{5}
   \]

Thus, the directional derivative of the function at \((0,0)\) in the direction of \(\langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the directional derivative of this piecewise function at (0,0) in the direction of the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩. Let me start by recalling what a directional derivative is. The directional derivative of a function f at a point P in the direction of a unit vector u is the rate at which f changes at P in the direction u. The formula for it is the dot product of the gradient of f at P and the unit vector u. But wait, does this function have a gradient at (0,0)? Hmm, the function is defined piecewise, with the value 0 at (0,0) since x² - y² = 0 there. For other points where x² - y² ≠ 0, it&#x27;s (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

First, I need to check if the function is differentiable at (0,0). If it isn&#x27;t, then the gradient might not exist, and I can&#x27;t use the standard gradient formula. Alternatively, even if the gradient doesn&#x27;t exist, the directional derivative might still exist using the limit definition. The directional derivative D_u f(0,0) can be computed as the limit as h approaches 0 of [f((0,0) + h*u) - f(0,0)] / h. Since f(0,0) is 0, that simplifies to the limit as h approaches 0 of f(h*(4/5), h*(3/5)) / h.

So maybe I should use this limit definition directly? Let&#x27;s try that. Let me set up the limit. The direction vector is ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which is already a unit vector because (4/5)² + (3/5)² = 16/25 + 9/25 = 25/25 = 1. So I don&#x27;t need to normalize it. Then, moving along this direction from (0,0), the point after a step h is (4h/5, 3h/5). Now, I need to compute f at this point and then divide by h, taking the limit as h approaches 0.

So let&#x27;s compute f(4h/5, 3h/5). First, check if x² - y² ≠ 0. Let&#x27;s compute x² - y² at (4h/5, 3h/5):

x² - y² = (4h/5)² - (3h/5)² = (16h²/25) - (9h²/25) = 7h²/25. Since h ≠ 0 (we&#x27;re taking the limit as h approaches 0), this is not zero. Therefore, we use the first case of f: (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

So compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = (64h³/125) + (27h³/125) = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = 7h²/25 as above.

Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91h³/125) * (25/(7h²)) = (91h * 25) / (125 * 7) = (91h * 5) / (25 * 7) [because 25/125 = 1/5] Wait, maybe simplifying step by step:

First, 91/7 = 13, so 91 divided by 7 is 13. Then, 25/125 = 1/5. So:

(91/7)*(25/125)*h = 13*(1/5)*h = (13/5)h. Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (13/5)h.

Then, the directional derivative is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(4h/5, 3h/5)] / h = (13/5 h) / h = 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Wait, let&#x27;s verify the calculations again step by step to be sure.

First, substituting x = 4h/5, y = 3h/5.

Compute numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3. Let&#x27;s compute each term:

(4h/5)^3 = 64h³ / 125

(3h/5)^3 = 27h³ / 125

Sum: 64 + 27 = 91, so numerator is 91h³ / 125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (4h/5)^2 - (3h/5)^2 = 16h²/25 - 9h²/25 = 7h²/25.

Thus, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/125)/(7/25) * h = (91/125)*(25/7) * h = (91*25)/(125*7) * h. Simplify 25/125 = 1/5, and 91/7 =13. So 13 * 1/5 = 13/5. Therefore, f(x,y) = (13/5)h.

Then, [f(h) - f(0,0)] / h = (13/5 h - 0)/h = 13/5. So the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5, which exists. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5.

Wait, but I should check if there are any issues with approaching from different directions. But since we are approaching along the specific direction given by the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which parametrizes the line through (0,0) in that direction, the calculation seems valid. Since the limit exists, the directional derivative exists and is 13/5.

But let me think again: sometimes functions can have directional derivatives in all directions but still not be differentiable at a point.

Wait, but 91/35 is 13/5, since 35*2=70, 91-70=21, 35*2.6=91? Wait, no. Wait 35*2 = 70, 35*2.6 = 70 + 35*0.6 = 70 + 21 = 91. So 91/35 = 2.6, which is 13/5. And 25/125 = 1/5. Wait, no, actually, (91/125)*(25/7) = (91/7)*(25/125) = 13*(1/5) = 13/5. Therefore, it&#x27;s 13/5 * t. Then, [f(t) - f(0)] / t = (13/5 t - 0)/t = 13/5. So same result. So yes, the directional derivative is 13/5. 

Alternatively, if I use the definition of directional derivative: D_u f(0,0) = lim_{h→0} [f(0 + h*(4/5), 0 + h*(3/5)) - f(0,0)] / h. Which is exactly what I computed. So this seems consistent.

Wait, but another thought: since the function is defined as 0 at (0,0), which is on the line x² - y² =0, which at (0,0) is just the origin. But when approaching along the direction (4/5, 3/5), the path x=4h/5, y=3h/5 is such that x² - y² =7h²/25 ≠0 for h≠0, so we are approaching along a path that stays in the region where f is defined by (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). Therefore, the calculation is valid. If we had approached along a direction where x² - y² =0, like along y = x or y = -x, then we would have different behavior. But here, the direction is such that x² - y² ≠0 along that path (except at h=0). Therefore, the limit only involves the expression (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²), which simplifies to 13/5 as h approaches 0.

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = 64h³/125 + 27h³/125 = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (16h²/25 -9h²/25) =7h²/25.

Therefore, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/7)*(h³/h²)*(25/125) =13*(h)*(1/5)=13h/5. Then, [f(x,y) - 0]/h = (13h/5)/h =13/5. Yep, that&#x27;s consistent.

So, even after multiple checks, the answer seems to be 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative at (0,0) in the direction ⟨4/5,3/5⟩ is 13/5.

To find the directional derivative of the function \( f(x,y) = \begin{cases}\frac{x^3+y^3}{x^2-y^2},\ x^2-y^2\neq 0 \\ 0, \ x^2-y^2=0\end{cases} \) at the point \((0,0)\) in the direction of the vector \(\langle\frac{4}{5},\frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we use the limit definition of the directional derivative.

Substituting \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we evaluate \( f \) at the point \(( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} )\):

   \]

3. **Evaluate \( f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) \):**
   \[
   f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) = \frac{\frac{91h^3}{125}}{\frac{7h^2}{25}} = \frac{91h^3}{125} \times \frac{25}{7h^2} = \frac{91h \times 25}{125 \times 7} = \frac{13h}{5}

The directional derivative D_u f(0,0) can be computed as the limit as h approaches 0 of [f((0,0) + h*u) - f(0,0)] / h. Since f(0,0) is 0, that simplifies to the limit as h approaches 0 of f(h*(4/5), h*(3/5)) / h.

So maybe I should use this limit definition directly? Let&#x27;s try that. Let me set up the limit. The direction vector is ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which is already a unit vector because (4/5)² + (3/5)² = 16/25 + 9/25 = 25/25 = 1. So I don&#x27;t need to normalize it. Then, moving along this direction from (0,0), the point after a step h is (4h/5, 3h/5). Now, I need to compute f at this point and then divide by h, taking the limit as h approaches 0.

So let&#x27;s compute f(4h/5, 3h/5). First, check if x² - y² ≠ 0. Let&#x27;s compute x² - y² at (4h/5, 3h/5):

x² - y² = (4h/5)² - (3h/5)² = (16h²/25) - (9h²/25) = 7h²/25. Since h ≠ 0 (we&#x27;re taking the limit as h approaches 0), this is not zero. Therefore, we use the first case of f: (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

So compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = (64h³/125) + (27h³/125) = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = 7h²/25 as above.

Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91h³/125) * (25/(7h²)) = (91h * 25) / (125 * 7) = (91h * 5) / (25 * 7) [because 25/125 = 1/5] Wait, maybe simplifying step by step:

First, 91/7 = 13, so 91 divided by 7 is 13. Then, 25/125 = 1/5. So:

(91/7)*(25/125)*h = 13*(1/5)*h = (13/5)h. Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (13/5)h.

Then, the directional derivative is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(4h/5, 3h/5)] / h = (13/5 h) / h = 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Wait, let&#x27;s verify the calculations again step by step to be sure.

First, substituting x = 4h/5, y = 3h/5.

Compute numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3. Let&#x27;s compute each term:

(4h/5)^3 = 64h³ / 125

(3h/5)^3 = 27h³ / 125

Sum: 64 + 27 = 91, so numerator is 91h³ / 125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (4h/5)^2 - (3h/5)^2 = 16h²/25 - 9h²/25 = 7h²/25.

Thus, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/125)/(7/25) * h = (91/125)*(25/7) * h = (91*25)/(125*7) * h. Simplify 25/125 = 1/5, and 91/7 =13. So 13 * 1/5 = 13/5. Therefore, f(x,y) = (13/5)h.

Then, [f(h) - f(0,0)] / h = (13/5 h - 0)/h = 13/5. So the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5, which exists. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5.

Wait, but I should check if there are any issues with approaching from different directions. But since we are approaching along the specific direction given by the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which parametrizes the line through (0,0) in that direction, the calculation seems valid. Since the limit exists, the directional derivative exists and is 13/5.

But let me think again: sometimes functions can have directional derivatives in all directions but still not be differentiable at a point. However, the question here only asks for the directional derivative in this specific direction, so even if the function isn&#x27;t differentiable at (0,0), as long as the limit exists along this direction, that&#x27;s the answer. 

Is there a possibility that the limit doesn&#x27;t exist here? Let me see. The expression simplified neatly to 13/5 h over h, so 13/5, which is a constant, so the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5. So that&#x27;s straightforward. Therefore, I think the directional derivative is 13/5.

But let me confirm once more. Another way is to parametrize the direction. Let’s suppose we approach along the direction (4/5, 3/5). So we can write x = 4t/5 and y = 3t/5, where t is a parameter approaching 0. Then f(x,y) = [ ( (4t/5)^3 + (3t/5)^3 ) / ( (4t/5)^2 - (3t/5)^2 ) ] = [ (64t³ + 27t³)/125 ] / [ (16t² - 9t²)/25 ] = [91t³/125] / [7t²/25] = (91t³/125) * (25/7t²) = (91*25)/(125*7) * t = (91/35) * (25/125) * t. Wait, but 91/35 is 13/5, since 35*2=70, 91-70=21, 35*2.6=91? Wait, no. Wait 35*2 = 70, 35*2.6 = 70 + 35*0.6 = 70 + 21 = 91. So 91/35 = 2.6, which is 13/5. And 25/125 = 1/5. Wait, no, actually, (91/125)*(25/7) = (91/7)*(25/125) = 13*(1/5) = 13/5. Therefore, it&#x27;s 13/5 * t. Then, [f(t) - f(0)] / t = (13/5 t - 0)/t = 13/5. So same result. So yes, the directional derivative is 13/5. 

Alternatively, if I use the definition of directional derivative: D_u f(0,0) = lim_{h→0} [f(0 + h*(4/5), 0 + h*(3/5)) - f(0,0)] / h. Which is exactly what I computed. So this seems consistent.

Wait, but another thought: since the function is defined as 0 at (0,0), which is on the line x² - y² =0, which at (0,0) is just the origin. But when approaching along the direction (4/5, 3/5), the path x=4h/5, y=3h/5 is such that x² - y² =7h²/25 ≠0 for h≠0, so we are approaching along a path that stays in the region where f is defined by (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). Therefore, the calculation is valid. If we had approached along a direction where x² - y² =0, like along y = x or y = -x, then we would have different behavior. But here, the direction is such that x² - y² ≠0 along that path (except at h=0). Therefore, the limit only involves the expression (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²), which simplifies to 13/5 as h approaches 0.

Therefore, I think the answer is 13/5. Let me check if I made a mistake in simplifying fractions. Let&#x27;s go through the computation again:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = 64h³/125 + 27h³/125 = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (16h²/25 -9h²/25) =7h²/25.

Therefore, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/7)*(h³/h²)*(25/125) =13*(h)*(1/5)=13h/5. Then, [f(x,y) - 0]/h = (13h/5)/h =13/5. Yep, that&#x27;s consistent.

So, even after multiple checks, the answer seems to be 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative at (0,0) in the direction ⟨4/5,3/5⟩ is 13/5.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the directional derivative of the function \( f(x,y) = \begin{cases}\frac{x^3+y^3}{x^2-y^2},\ x^2-y^2\neq 0 \\ 0, \ x^2-y^2=0\end{cases} \) at the point \((0,0)\) in the direction of the vector \(\langle\frac{4}{5},\frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we use the limit definition of the directional derivative.

The directional derivative \( D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) \) in the direction of a unit vector \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is given by:
\[
D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f((0,0) + h\mathbf{u}) - f(0,0)}{h}
\]

Substituting \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we evaluate \( f \) at the point \(( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} )\):

1. **Check the denominator \( x^2 - y^2 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^2 = \frac{16h^2}{25} - \frac{9h^2}{25} = \frac{7h^2}{25} \neq 0 \text{ for } h \neq 0
   \]

2. **Compute the numerator \( x^3 + y^3 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^3 + \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^3 = \frac{64h^3}{125} + \frac{27h^3}{125} = \frac{91h^3}{125}
   \]

3. **Evaluate \( f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) \):**
   \[
   f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) = \frac{\frac{91h^3}{125}}{\frac{7h^2}{25}} = \frac{91h^3}{125} \times \frac{25}{7h^2} = \frac{91h \times 25}{125 \times 7} = \frac{13h}{5}
   \]

4. **Compute the directional derivative:**
   \[
   D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{13h}{5}}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{13}{5} = \frac{13}{5}
   \]

Thus, the directional derivative of the function at \((0,0)\) in the direction of \(\langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the directional derivative of this piecewise function at (0,0) in the direction of the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩. Let me start by recalling what a directional derivative is. The directional derivative of a function f at a point P in the direction of a unit vector u is the rate at which f changes at P in the direction u. The formula for it is the dot product of the gradient of f at P and the unit vector u. But wait, does this function have a gradient at (0,0)? Hmm, the function is defined piecewise, with the value 0 at (0,0) since x² - y² = 0 there. For other points where x² - y² ≠ 0, it&#x27;s (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

First, I need to check if the function is differentiable at (0,0). If it isn&#x27;t, then the gradient might not exist, and I can&#x27;t use the standard gradient formula. Alternatively, even if the gradient doesn&#x27;t exist, the directional derivative might still exist using the limit definition. The directional derivative D_u f(0,0) can be computed as the limit as h approaches 0 of [f((0,0) + h*u) - f(0,0)] / h. Since f(0,0) is 0, that simplifies to the limit as h approaches 0 of f(h*(4/5), h*(3/5)) / h.

So maybe I should use this limit definition directly? Let&#x27;s try that. Let me set up the limit. The direction vector is ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which is already a unit vector because (4/5)² + (3/5)² = 16/25 + 9/25 = 25/25 = 1. So I don&#x27;t need to normalize it. Then, moving along this direction from (0,0), the point after a step h is (4h/5, 3h/5). Now, I need to compute f at this point and then divide by h, taking the limit as h approaches 0.

So let&#x27;s compute f(4h/5, 3h/5). First, check if x² - y² ≠ 0. Let&#x27;s compute x² - y² at (4h/5, 3h/5):

x² - y² = (4h/5)² - (3h/5)² = (16h²/25) - (9h²/25) = 7h²/25. Since h ≠ 0 (we&#x27;re taking the limit as h approaches 0), this is not zero. Therefore, we use the first case of f: (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

So compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = (64h³/125) + (27h³/125) = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = 7h²/25 as above.

Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91h³/125) * (25/(7h²)) = (91h * 25) / (125 * 7) = (91h * 5) / (25 * 7) [because 25/125 = 1/5] Wait, maybe simplifying step by step:

First, 91/7 = 13, so 91 divided by 7 is 13. Then, 25/125 = 1/5. So:

(91/7)*(25/125)*h = 13*(1/5)*h = (13/5)h. Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (13/5)h.

Then, the directional derivative is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(4h/5, 3h/5)] / h = (13/5 h) / h = 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Wait, let&#x27;s verify the calculations again step by step to be sure.

First, substituting x = 4h/5, y = 3h/5.

Compute numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3. Let&#x27;s compute each term:

(4h/5)^3 = 64h³ / 125

(3h/5)^3 = 27h³ / 125

Sum: 64 + 27 = 91, so numerator is 91h³ / 125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (4h/5)^2 - (3h/5)^2 = 16h²/25 - 9h²/25 = 7h²/25.

Thus, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/125)/(7/25) * h = (91/125)*(25/7) * h = (91*25)/(125*7) * h. Simplify 25/125 = 1/5, and 91/7 =13. So 13 * 1/5 = 13/5. Therefore, f(x,y) = (13/5)h.

Then, [f(h) - f(0,0)] / h = (13/5 h - 0)/h = 13/5. So the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5, which exists. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5.

Wait, but 91/35 is 13/5, since 35*2=70, 91-70=21, 35*2.6=91? Wait, no. Wait 35*2 = 70, 35*2.6 = 70 + 35*0.6 = 70 + 21 = 91. So 91/35 = 2.6, which is 13/5. And 25/125 = 1/5. Wait, no, actually, (91/125)*(25/7) = (91/7)*(25/125) = 13*(1/5) = 13/5. Therefore, it&#x27;s 13/5 * t. Then, [f(t) - f(0)] / t = (13/5 t - 0)/t = 13/5. So same result. So yes, the directional derivative is 13/5. 

Alternatively, if I use the definition of directional derivative: D_u f(0,0) = lim_{h→0} [f(0 + h*(4/5), 0 + h*(3/5)) - f(0,0)] / h. Which is exactly what I computed. So this seems consistent.

Wait, but another thought: since the function is defined as 0 at (0,0), which is on the line x² - y² =0, which at (0,0) is just the origin. But when approaching along the direction (4/5, 3/5), the path x=4h/5, y=3h/5 is such that x² - y² =7h²/25 ≠0 for h≠0, so we are approaching along a path that stays in the region where f is defined by (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²).

Therefore, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/7)*(h³/h²)*(25/125) =13*(h)*(1/5)=13h/5. Then, [f(x,y) - 0]/h = (13h/5)/h =13/5. Yep, that&#x27;s consistent.

So, even after multiple checks, the answer seems to be 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative at (0,0) in the direction ⟨4/5,3/5⟩ is 13/5.

Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the directional derivative of this piecewise function at (0,0) in the direction of the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩. Let me start by recalling what a directional derivative is. The directional derivative of a function f at a point P in the direction of a unit vector u is the rate at which f changes at P in the direction u. The formula for it is the dot product of the gradient of f at P and the unit vector u. But wait, does this function have a gradient at (0,0)? Hmm, the function is defined piecewise, with the value 0 at (0,0) since x² - y² = 0 there. For other points where x² - y² ≠ 0, it&#x27;s (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

First, I need to check if the function is differentiable at (0,0). If it isn&#x27;t, then the gradient might not exist, and I can&#x27;t use the standard gradient formula. Alternatively, even if the gradient doesn&#x27;t exist, the directional derivative might still exist using the limit definition. The directional derivative D_u f(0,0) can be computed as the limit as h approaches 0 of [f((0,0) + h*u) - f(0,0)] / h. Since f(0,0) is 0, that simplifies to the limit as h approaches 0 of f(h*(4/5), h*(3/5)) / h.

So maybe I should use this limit definition directly? Let&#x27;s try that. Let me set up the limit. The direction vector is ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which is already a unit vector because (4/5)² + (3/5)² = 16/25 + 9/25 = 25/25 = 1. So I don&#x27;t need to normalize it. Then, moving along this direction from (0,0), the point after a step h is (4h/5, 3h/5). Now, I need to compute f at this point and then divide by h, taking the limit as h approaches 0.

So let&#x27;s compute f(4h/5, 3h/5). First, check if x² - y² ≠ 0. Let&#x27;s compute x² - y² at (4h/5, 3h/5):

x² - y² = (4h/5)² - (3h/5)² = (16h²/25) - (9h²/25) = 7h²/25. Since h ≠ 0 (we&#x27;re taking the limit as h approaches 0), this is not zero. Therefore, we use the first case of f: (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

So compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = (64h³/125) + (27h³/125) = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = 7h²/25 as above.

Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91h³/125) * (25/(7h²)) = (91h * 25) / (125 * 7) = (91h * 5) / (25 * 7) [because 25/125 = 1/5] Wait, maybe simplifying step by step:

First, 91/7 = 13, so 91 divided by 7 is 13. Then, 25/125 = 1/5. So:

(91/7)*(25/125)*h = 13*(1/5)*h = (13/5)h. Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (13/5)h.

Then, the directional derivative is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(4h/5, 3h/5)] / h = (13/5 h) / h = 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Wait, let&#x27;s verify the calculations again step by step to be sure.

First, substituting x = 4h/5, y = 3h/5.

Compute numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3. Let&#x27;s compute each term:

(4h/5)^3 = 64h³ / 125

(3h/5)^3 = 27h³ / 125

Sum: 64 + 27 = 91, so numerator is 91h³ / 125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (4h/5)^2 - (3h/5)^2 = 16h²/25 - 9h²/25 = 7h²/25.

Thus, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/125)/(7/25) * h = (91/125)*(25/7) * h = (91*25)/(125*7) * h. Simplify 25/125 = 1/5, and 91/7 =13. So 13 * 1/5 = 13/5. Therefore, f(x,y) = (13/5)h.

Then, [f(h) - f(0,0)] / h = (13/5 h - 0)/h = 13/5. So the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5, which exists. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5.

Wait, but I should check if there are any issues with approaching from different directions. But since we are approaching along the specific direction given by the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which parametrizes the line through (0,0) in that direction, the calculation seems valid. Since the limit exists, the directional derivative exists and is 13/5.

But let me think again: sometimes functions can have directional derivatives in all directions but still not be differentiable at a point. However, the question here only asks for the directional derivative in this specific direction, so even if the function isn&#x27;t differentiable at (0,0), as long as the limit exists along this direction, that&#x27;s the answer. 

Is there a possibility that the limit doesn&#x27;t exist here? Let me see. The expression simplified neatly to 13/5 h over h, so 13/5, which is a constant, so the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5. So that&#x27;s straightforward. Therefore, I think the directional derivative is 13/5.

But let me confirm once more. Another way is to parametrize the direction. Let’s suppose we approach along the direction (4/5, 3/5). So we can write x = 4t/5 and y = 3t/5, where t is a parameter approaching 0. Then f(x,y) = [ ( (4t/5)^3 + (3t/5)^3 ) / ( (4t/5)^2 - (3t/5)^2 ) ] = [ (64t³ + 27t³)/125 ] / [ (16t² - 9t²)/25 ] = [91t³/125] / [7t²/25] = (91t³/125) * (25/7t²) = (91*25)/(125*7) * t = (91/35) * (25/125) * t. Wait, but 91/35 is 13/5, since 35*2=70, 91-70=21, 35*2.6=91? Wait, no. Wait 35*2 = 70, 35*2.6 = 70 + 35*0.6 = 70 + 21 = 91. So 91/35 = 2.6, which is 13/5. And 25/125 = 1/5. Wait, no, actually, (91/125)*(25/7) = (91/7)*(25/125) = 13*(1/5) = 13/5. Therefore, it&#x27;s 13/5 * t. Then, [f(t) - f(0)] / t = (13/5 t - 0)/t = 13/5. So same result. So yes, the directional derivative is 13/5. 

Alternatively, if I use the definition of directional derivative: D_u f(0,0) = lim_{h→0} [f(0 + h*(4/5), 0 + h*(3/5)) - f(0,0)] / h. Which is exactly what I computed. So this seems consistent.

Wait, but another thought: since the function is defined as 0 at (0,0), which is on the line x² - y² =0, which at (0,0) is just the origin. But when approaching along the direction (4/5, 3/5), the path x=4h/5, y=3h/5 is such that x² - y² =7h²/25 ≠0 for h≠0, so we are approaching along a path that stays in the region where f is defined by (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). Therefore, the calculation is valid. If we had approached along a direction where x² - y² =0, like along y = x or y = -x, then we would have different behavior. But here, the direction is such that x² - y² ≠0 along that path (except at h=0). Therefore, the limit only involves the expression (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²), which simplifies to 13/5 as h approaches 0.

Therefore, I think the answer is 13/5. Let me check if I made a mistake in simplifying fractions. Let&#x27;s go through the computation again:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = 64h³/125 + 27h³/125 = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (16h²/25 -9h²/25) =7h²/25.

Therefore, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/7)*(h³/h²)*(25/125) =13*(h)*(1/5)=13h/5. Then, [f(x,y) - 0]/h = (13h/5)/h =13/5. Yep, that&#x27;s consistent.

So, even after multiple checks, the answer seems to be 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative at (0,0) in the direction ⟨4/5,3/5⟩ is 13/5.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the directional derivative of the function \( f(x,y) = \begin{cases}\frac{x^3+y^3}{x^2-y^2},\ x^2-y^2\neq 0 \\ 0, \ x^2-y^2=0\end{cases} \) at the point \((0,0)\) in the direction of the vector \(\langle\frac{4}{5},\frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we use the limit definition of the directional derivative.

The directional derivative \( D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) \) in the direction of a unit vector \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is given by:
\[
D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f((0,0) + h\mathbf{u}) - f(0,0)}{h}
\]

Substituting \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we evaluate \( f \) at the point \(( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} )\):

1. **Check the denominator \( x^2 - y^2 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^2 = \frac{16h^2}{25} - \frac{9h^2}{25} = \frac{7h^2}{25} \neq 0 \text{ for } h \neq 0
   \]

2. **Compute the numerator \( x^3 + y^3 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^3 + \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^3 = \frac{64h^3}{125} + \frac{27h^3}{125} = \frac{91h^3}{125}
   \]

3. **Evaluate \( f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) \):**
   \[
   f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) = \frac{\frac{91h^3}{125}}{\frac{7h^2}{25}} = \frac{91h^3}{125} \times \frac{25}{7h^2} = \frac{91h \times 25}{125 \times 7} = \frac{13h}{5}
   \]

4. **Compute the directional derivative:**
   \[
   D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{13h}{5}}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{13}{5} = \frac{13}{5}
   \]

Thus, the directional derivative of the function at \((0,0)\) in the direction of \(\langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the directional derivative of this piecewise function at (0,0) in the direction of the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩. Let me start by recalling what a directional derivative is. The directional derivative of a function f at a point P in the direction of a unit vector u is the rate at which f changes at P in the direction u. The formula for it is the dot product of the gradient of f at P and the unit vector u. But wait, does this function have a gradient at (0,0)? Hmm, the function is defined piecewise, with the value 0 at (0,0) since x² - y² = 0 there. For other points where x² - y² ≠ 0, it&#x27;s (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

First, I need to check if the function is differentiable at (0,0). If it isn&#x27;t, then the gradient might not exist, and I can&#x27;t use the standard gradient formula. Alternatively, even if the gradient doesn&#x27;t exist, the directional derivative might still exist using the limit definition. The directional derivative D_u f(0,0) can be computed as the limit as h approaches 0 of [f((0,0) + h*u) - f(0,0)] / h. Since f(0,0) is 0, that simplifies to the limit as h approaches 0 of f(h*(4/5), h*(3/5)) / h.

So maybe I should use this limit definition directly? Let&#x27;s try that. Let me set up the limit. The direction vector is ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which is already a unit vector because (4/5)² + (3/5)² = 16/25 + 9/25 = 25/25 = 1. So I don&#x27;t need to normalize it. Then, moving along this direction from (0,0), the point after a step h is (4h/5, 3h/5). Now, I need to compute f at this point and then divide by h, taking the limit as h approaches 0.

So let&#x27;s compute f(4h/5, 3h/5). First, check if x² - y² ≠ 0. Let&#x27;s compute x² - y² at (4h/5, 3h/5):

x² - y² = (4h/5)² - (3h/5)² = (16h²/25) - (9h²/25) = 7h²/25. Since h ≠ 0 (we&#x27;re taking the limit as h approaches 0), this is not zero. Therefore, we use the first case of f: (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

So compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = (64h³/125) + (27h³/125) = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = 7h²/25 as above.

Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91h³/125) * (25/(7h²)) = (91h * 25) / (125 * 7) = (91h * 5) / (25 * 7) [because 25/125 = 1/5] Wait, maybe simplifying step by step:

First, 91/7 = 13, so 91 divided by 7 is 13. Then, 25/125 = 1/5. So:

(91/7)*(25/125)*h = 13*(1/5)*h = (13/5)h. Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (13/5)h.

Then, the directional derivative is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(4h/5, 3h/5)] / h = (13/5 h) / h = 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Wait, let&#x27;s verify the calculations again step by step to be sure.

First, substituting x = 4h/5, y = 3h/5.

Compute numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3. Let&#x27;s compute each term:

(4h/5)^3 = 64h³ / 125

(3h/5)^3 = 27h³ / 125

Sum: 64 + 27 = 91, so numerator is 91h³ / 125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (4h/5)^2 - (3h/5)^2 = 16h²/25 - 9h²/25 = 7h²/25.

Thus, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/125)/(7/25) * h = (91/125)*(25/7) * h = (91*25)/(125*7) * h. Simplify 25/125 = 1/5, and 91/7 =13. So 13 * 1/5 = 13/5. Therefore, f(x,y) = (13/5)h.

Then, [f(h) - f(0,0)] / h = (13/5 h - 0)/h = 13/5. So the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5, which exists. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5.

Wait, but I should check if there are any issues with approaching from different directions. But since we are approaching along the specific direction given by the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which parametrizes the line through (0,0) in that direction, the calculation seems valid. Since the limit exists, the directional derivative exists and is 13/5.

But let me think again: sometimes functions can have directional derivatives in all directions but still not be differentiable at a point. However, the question here only asks for the directional derivative in this specific direction, so even if the function isn&#x27;t differentiable at (0,0), as long as the limit exists along this direction, that&#x27;s the answer.

But let me confirm once more. Another way is to parametrize the direction. Let’s suppose we approach along the direction (4/5, 3/5). So we can write x = 4t/5 and y = 3t/5, where t is a parameter approaching 0. Then f(x,y) = [ ( (4t/5)^3 + (3t/5)^3 ) / ( (4t/5)^2 - (3t/5)^2 ) ] = [ (64t³ + 27t³)/125 ] / [ (16t² - 9t²)/25 ] = [91t³/125] / [7t²/25] = (91t³/125) * (25/7t²) = (91*25)/(125*7) * t = (91/35) * (25/125) * t. Wait, but 91/35 is 13/5, since 35*2=70, 91-70=21, 35*2.6=91? Wait, no. Wait 35*2 = 70, 35*2.6 = 70 + 35*0.6 = 70 + 21 = 91. So 91/35 = 2.6, which is 13/5. And 25/125 = 1/5. Wait, no, actually, (91/125)*(25/7) = (91/7)*(25/125) = 13*(1/5) = 13/5. Therefore, it&#x27;s 13/5 * t. Then, [f(t) - f(0)] / t = (13/5 t - 0)/t = 13/5. So same result. So yes, the directional derivative is 13/5. 

Alternatively, if I use the definition of directional derivative: D_u f(0,0) = lim_{h→0} [f(0 + h*(4/5), 0 + h*(3/5)) - f(0,0)] / h. Which is exactly what I computed. So this seems consistent.

Wait, but another thought: since the function is defined as 0 at (0,0), which is on the line x² - y² =0, which at (0,0) is just the origin. But when approaching along the direction (4/5, 3/5), the path x=4h/5, y=3h/5 is such that x² - y² =7h²/25 ≠0 for h≠0, so we are approaching along a path that stays in the region where f is defined by (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). Therefore, the calculation is valid. If we had approached along a direction where x² - y² =0, like along y = x or y = -x, then we would have different behavior. But here, the direction is such that x² - y² ≠0 along that path (except at h=0). Therefore, the limit only involves the expression (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²), which simplifies to 13/5 as h approaches 0.

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = 64h³/125 + 27h³/125 = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (16h²/25 -9h²/25) =7h²/25.

Therefore, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/7)*(h³/h²)*(25/125) =13*(h)*(1/5)=13h/5. Then, [f(x,y) - 0]/h = (13h/5)/h =13/5. Yep, that&#x27;s consistent.

So, even after multiple checks, the answer seems to be 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative at (0,0) in the direction ⟨4/5,3/5⟩ is 13/5.

To find the directional derivative of the function \( f(x,y) = \begin{cases}\frac{x^3+y^3}{x^2-y^2},\ x^2-y^2\neq 0 \\ 0, \ x^2-y^2=0\end{cases} \) at the point \((0,0)\) in the direction of the vector \(\langle\frac{4}{5},\frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we use the limit definition of the directional derivative.

The directional derivative \( D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) \) in the direction of a unit vector \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is given by:
\[
D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f((0,0) + h\mathbf{u}) - f(0,0)}{h}
\]

Substituting \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we evaluate \( f \) at the point \(( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} )\):

1. **Check the denominator \( x^2 - y^2 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^2 = \frac{16h^2}{25} - \frac{9h^2}{25} = \frac{7h^2}{25} \neq 0 \text{ for } h \neq 0
   \]

2. **Compute the numerator \( x^3 + y^3 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^3 + \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^3 = \frac{64h^3}{125} + \frac{27h^3}{125} = \frac{91h^3}{125}
   \]

3. **Evaluate \( f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) \):**
   \[
   f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) = \frac{\frac{91h^3}{125}}{\frac{7h^2}{25}} = \frac{91h^3}{125} \times \frac{25}{7h^2} = \frac{91h \times 25}{125 \times 7} = \frac{13h}{5}
   \]

4. **Compute the directional derivative:**
   \[
   D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{13h}{5}}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{13}{5} = \frac{13}{5}

Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the directional derivative of this piecewise function at (0,0) in the direction of the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩. Let me start by recalling what a directional derivative is. The directional derivative of a function f at a point P in the direction of a unit vector u is the rate at which f changes at P in the direction u. The formula for it is the dot product of the gradient of f at P and the unit vector u. But wait, does this function have a gradient at (0,0)? Hmm, the function is defined piecewise, with the value 0 at (0,0) since x² - y² = 0 there. For other points where x² - y² ≠ 0, it&#x27;s (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

First, I need to check if the function is differentiable at (0,0). If it isn&#x27;t, then the gradient might not exist, and I can&#x27;t use the standard gradient formula. Alternatively, even if the gradient doesn&#x27;t exist, the directional derivative might still exist using the limit definition. The directional derivative D_u f(0,0) can be computed as the limit as h approaches 0 of [f((0,0) + h*u) - f(0,0)] / h. Since f(0,0) is 0, that simplifies to the limit as h approaches 0 of f(h*(4/5), h*(3/5)) / h.

So maybe I should use this limit definition directly? Let&#x27;s try that. Let me set up the limit. The direction vector is ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which is already a unit vector because (4/5)² + (3/5)² = 16/25 + 9/25 = 25/25 = 1. So I don&#x27;t need to normalize it. Then, moving along this direction from (0,0), the point after a step h is (4h/5, 3h/5). Now, I need to compute f at this point and then divide by h, taking the limit as h approaches 0.

So let&#x27;s compute f(4h/5, 3h/5). First, check if x² - y² ≠ 0. Let&#x27;s compute x² - y² at (4h/5, 3h/5):

x² - y² = (4h/5)² - (3h/5)² = (16h²/25) - (9h²/25) = 7h²/25. Since h ≠ 0 (we&#x27;re taking the limit as h approaches 0), this is not zero. Therefore, we use the first case of f: (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

So compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = (64h³/125) + (27h³/125) = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = 7h²/25 as above.

Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91h³/125) * (25/(7h²)) = (91h * 25) / (125 * 7) = (91h * 5) / (25 * 7) [because 25/125 = 1/5] Wait, maybe simplifying step by step:

First, 91/7 = 13, so 91 divided by 7 is 13. Then, 25/125 = 1/5. So:

(91/7)*(25/125)*h = 13*(1/5)*h = (13/5)h. Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (13/5)h.

Then, the directional derivative is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(4h/5, 3h/5)] / h = (13/5 h) / h = 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Wait, let&#x27;s verify the calculations again step by step to be sure.

First, substituting x = 4h/5, y = 3h/5.

Compute numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3. Let&#x27;s compute each term:

(4h/5)^3 = 64h³ / 125

(3h/5)^3 = 27h³ / 125

Sum: 64 + 27 = 91, so numerator is 91h³ / 125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (4h/5)^2 - (3h/5)^2 = 16h²/25 - 9h²/25 = 7h²/25.

Thus, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/125)/(7/25) * h = (91/125)*(25/7) * h = (91*25)/(125*7) * h. Simplify 25/125 = 1/5, and 91/7 =13. So 13 * 1/5 = 13/5. Therefore, f(x,y) = (13/5)h.

Then, [f(h) - f(0,0)] / h = (13/5 h - 0)/h = 13/5. So the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5, which exists. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5.

Wait, but I should check if there are any issues with approaching from different directions. But since we are approaching along the specific direction given by the vector ⟨4/5, 3/5⟩, which parametrizes the line through (0,0) in that direction, the calculation seems valid. Since the limit exists, the directional derivative exists and is 13/5.

But let me think again: sometimes functions can have directional derivatives in all directions but still not be differentiable at a point. However, the question here only asks for the directional derivative in this specific direction, so even if the function isn&#x27;t differentiable at (0,0), as long as the limit exists along this direction, that&#x27;s the answer. 

Is there a possibility that the limit doesn&#x27;t exist here? Let me see. The expression simplified neatly to 13/5 h over h, so 13/5, which is a constant, so the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5. So that&#x27;s straightforward. Therefore, I think the directional derivative is 13/5.

But let me confirm once more. Another way is to parametrize the direction. Let’s suppose we approach along the direction (4/5, 3/5). So we can write x = 4t/5 and y = 3t/5, where t is a parameter approaching 0. Then f(x,y) = [ ( (4t/5)^3 + (3t/5)^3 ) / ( (4t/5)^2 - (3t/5)^2 ) ] = [ (64t³ + 27t³)/125 ] / [ (16t² - 9t²)/25 ] = [91t³/125] / [7t²/25] = (91t³/125) * (25/7t²) = (91*25)/(125*7) * t = (91/35) * (25/125) * t. Wait, but 91/35 is 13/5, since 35*2=70, 91-70=21, 35*2.6=91? Wait, no. Wait 35*2 = 70, 35*2.6 = 70 + 35*0.6 = 70 + 21 = 91. So 91/35 = 2.6, which is 13/5. And 25/125 = 1/5. Wait, no, actually, (91/125)*(25/7) = (91/7)*(25/125) = 13*(1/5) = 13/5. Therefore, it&#x27;s 13/5 * t. Then, [f(t) - f(0)] / t = (13/5 t - 0)/t = 13/5. So same result. So yes, the directional derivative is 13/5. 

Alternatively, if I use the definition of directional derivative: D_u f(0,0) = lim_{h→0} [f(0 + h*(4/5), 0 + h*(3/5)) - f(0,0)] / h. Which is exactly what I computed. So this seems consistent.

Wait, but another thought: since the function is defined as 0 at (0,0), which is on the line x² - y² =0, which at (0,0) is just the origin. But when approaching along the direction (4/5, 3/5), the path x=4h/5, y=3h/5 is such that x² - y² =7h²/25 ≠0 for h≠0, so we are approaching along a path that stays in the region where f is defined by (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). Therefore, the calculation is valid. If we had approached along a direction where x² - y² =0, like along y = x or y = -x, then we would have different behavior. But here, the direction is such that x² - y² ≠0 along that path (except at h=0). Therefore, the limit only involves the expression (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²), which simplifies to 13/5 as h approaches 0.

Therefore, I think the answer is 13/5. Let me check if I made a mistake in simplifying fractions. Let&#x27;s go through the computation again:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = 64h³/125 + 27h³/125 = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = (16h²/25 -9h²/25) =7h²/25.

Therefore, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/7)*(h³/h²)*(25/125) =13*(h)*(1/5)=13h/5. Then, [f(x,y) - 0]/h = (13h/5)/h =13/5. Yep, that&#x27;s consistent.

So, even after multiple checks, the answer seems to be 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative at (0,0) in the direction ⟨4/5,3/5⟩ is 13/5.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the directional derivative of the function \( f(x,y) = \begin{cases}\frac{x^3+y^3}{x^2-y^2},\ x^2-y^2\neq 0 \\ 0, \ x^2-y^2=0\end{cases} \) at the point \((0,0)\) in the direction of the vector \(\langle\frac{4}{5},\frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we use the limit definition of the directional derivative.

The directional derivative \( D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) \) in the direction of a unit vector \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is given by:
\[
D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f((0,0) + h\mathbf{u}) - f(0,0)}{h}
\]

Substituting \(\mathbf{u} = \langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\), we evaluate \( f \) at the point \(( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} )\):

1. **Check the denominator \( x^2 - y^2 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^2 = \frac{16h^2}{25} - \frac{9h^2}{25} = \frac{7h^2}{25} \neq 0 \text{ for } h \neq 0
   \]

2. **Compute the numerator \( x^3 + y^3 \):**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4h}{5} \right)^3 + \left( \frac{3h}{5} \right)^3 = \frac{64h^3}{125} + \frac{27h^3}{125} = \frac{91h^3}{125}
   \]

3. **Evaluate \( f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) \):**
   \[
   f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) = \frac{\frac{91h^3}{125}}{\frac{7h^2}{25}} = \frac{91h^3}{125} \times \frac{25}{7h^2} = \frac{91h \times 25}{125 \times 7} = \frac{13h}{5}
   \]

4. **Compute the directional derivative:**
   \[
   D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{13h}{5}}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{13}{5} = \frac{13}{5}
   \]

Thus, the directional derivative of the function at \((0,0)\) in the direction of \(\langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}\).          </p>

Response: First, we use the definition of the directional derivative, and substitute in the vector \(\langle\frac{4}{5},\frac{3}{5} \rangle\).

Let me start by recalling what a directional derivative is. The directional derivative of a function f at a point P in the direction of a unit vector u is the rate at which f changes at P in the direction u. The formula for it is the dot product of the gradient of f at P and the unit vector u. But wait, does this function have a gradient at (0,0)? Hmm, the function is defined piecewise, with the value 0 at (0,0) since x² - y² = 0 there. For other points where x² - y² ≠ 0, it&#x27;s (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²).

Then, moving along this direction from (0,0), the point after a step h is (4h/5, 3h/5). Now, I need to compute f at this point and then divide by h, taking the limit as h approaches 0.

So let&#x27;s compute f(4h/5, 3h/5). First, check if x² - y² ≠ 0. Let&#x27;s compute x² - y² at (4h/5, 3h/5):

x² - y² = (4h/5)² - (3h/5)² = (16h²/25) - (9h²/25) = 7h²/25. Since h ≠ 0 (we&#x27;re taking the limit as h approaches 0), this is not zero. Therefore, we use the first case of f: (x³ + y³)/(x² - y²). 

So compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x³ + y³ = (4h/5)^3 + (3h/5)^3 = (64h³/125) + (27h³/125) = 91h³/125.

Denominator: x² - y² = 7h²/25 as above.

Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91h³/125) * (25/(7h²)) = (91h * 25) / (125 * 7) = (91h * 5) / (25 * 7) [because 25/125 = 1/5] Wait, maybe simplifying step by step:

First, 91/7 = 13, so 91 divided by 7 is 13. Then, 25/125 = 1/5. So:

(91/7)*(25/125)*h = 13*(1/5)*h = (13/5)h. Therefore, f(4h/5, 3h/5) = (13/5)h.

Then, the directional derivative is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(4h/5, 3h/5)] / h = (13/5 h) / h = 13/5. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Denominator: x² - y² = (4h/5)^2 - (3h/5)^2 = 16h²/25 - 9h²/25 = 7h²/25.

Thus, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/125)/(7/25) * h = (91/125)*(25/7) * h = (91*25)/(125*7) * h. Simplify 25/125 = 1/5, and 91/7 =13. So 13 * 1/5 = 13/5. Therefore, f(x,y) = (13/5)h.

Then, [f(h) - f(0,0)] / h = (13/5 h - 0)/h = 13/5. So the limit as h approaches 0 is 13/5, which exists. Therefore, the directional derivative is 13/5.

Therefore, f(x,y) = (91h³/125) / (7h²/25) = (91/7)*(h³/h²)*(25/125) =13*(h)*(1/5)=13h/5. Then, [f(x,y) - 0]/h = (13h/5)/h =13/5. Yep, that&#x27;s consistent.

   f \left( \frac{4h}{5}, \frac{3h}{5} \right) = \frac{\frac{91h^3}{125}}{\frac{7h^2}{25}} = \frac{91h^3}{125} \times \frac{25}{7h^2} = \frac{91h \times 25}{125 \times 7} = \frac{13h}{5}
   \]

4. **Compute the directional derivative:**
   \[
   D_{\mathbf{u}} f(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{13h}{5}}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{13}{5} = \frac{13}{5}
   \]

Thus, the directional derivative of the function at \((0,0)\) in the direction of \(\langle \frac{4}{5}, \frac{3}{5} \rangle\) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{13}{5}}\).          </p>
