Problem: Given 95 numbers \( a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{95} \) where each number is either +1 or -1, determine the minimum value of the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_{i} a_{j} \). Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>

Response: Since \( a_{1} a_{2} \) are the terms on the far leftmost diagonal of the matrix, the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_{i} a_{j} \) is \(\min \{ 95, \max a_{1} a_{2} \} \).

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have 95 numbers, each of which is either +1 or -1. We need to find the minimum value of the sum of all products \(a_i a_j\) where \(1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95\). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me recall that when dealing with sums of products of variables that are ±1, there might be some clever algebraic manipulation or identity that can simplify the problem. Maybe expanding a square or something like that. Let me try to remember.

Wait, the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_i a_j \) looks familiar. If I consider the square of the sum of all the \(a_i\), let&#x27;s denote \( S = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \). Then, \( S^2 = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \right)^2 \). Expanding this square would give me \( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j \). Right?

So, \( S^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j \). But each \(a_i\) is either +1 or -1, so \(a_i^2 = 1\) for all i. Therefore, \( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 = 95 \times 1 = 95 \).

So substituting back, \( S^2 = 95 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j \). Therefore, the sum we need is \( \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{S^2 - 95}{2} \).

Okay, so the problem reduces to minimizing \( \frac{S^2 - 95}{2} \). Since the denominator is 2, the minimum of this expression occurs when \( S^2 \) is as small as possible. Therefore, we need to minimize \( S^2 \), which is equivalent to minimizing the absolute value of \( S \), because square is a non-negative function.

But \( S \) is the sum of 95 terms each of which is ±1. So, \( S \) must be an odd integer because we have an odd number of terms. Wait, 95 is odd. If you add an odd number of ±1s, the result is odd. Because, for example, if you have k +1s and (95 - k) -1s, then the sum S = k*1 + (95 - k)*(-1) = k - (95 - k) = 2k - 95. Since 95 is odd, 2k is even, so even minus odd is odd. Therefore, S is an odd integer. Therefore, the minimal |S| is 1, because you can&#x27;t have an odd integer sum of 95 ±1s equal to 0. So the smallest possible |S| is 1.

But wait, if we can get S = ±1, then S² = 1, so the sum becomes (1 - 95)/2 = (-94)/2 = -47. So the minimal value would be -47. But is that correct? Wait, let me check again.

Wait, first, is it possible to have S = 1? Let&#x27;s see. Let&#x27;s suppose we have k +1s and (95 - k) -1s. Then S = 2k - 95. If S = 1, then 2k - 95 = 1, so 2k = 96, so k = 48. So 48 +1s and 95 - 48 = 47 -1s. Therefore, that&#x27;s possible. Similarly, if S = -1, then 2k - 95 = -1, so 2k = 94, so k = 47. So 47 +1s and 48 -1s. Therefore, yes, it&#x27;s possible to have S = ±1.

Therefore, if we can achieve S = ±1, then the sum would be (1 - 95)/2 = -47. Therefore, the minimal value is -47. But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum value. So is this the minimal value? Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_i a_j \) is equal to \( \frac{S^2 - 95}{2} \). Since S² is non-negative, the minimal value occurs when S² is as small as possible. Since the minimal S² is 1, then the minimal sum is (1 - 95)/2 = -47. But let me check if S can be 1.

But wait, suppose instead that S is larger. For example, if S is 3, then the sum would be (9 - 95)/2 = -43, which is larger than -47. If S is 5, sum is (25 - 95)/2 = -35, which is even larger. So the smaller the S², the smaller the sum. Therefore, the minimal sum is indeed achieved when S² is minimal, which is 1, giving sum -47.

But let me check again with a small example. Suppose instead of 95 elements, let&#x27;s take 3 elements. If all are +1, then S = 3, sum of products is 3 choose 2 = 3. Alternatively, if two +1 and one -1, then S = 2 -1 =1, sum of products would be (1^2 -3)/2 = (1 -3)/2 = -1. Let&#x27;s compute manually: The products would be (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1, which matches. If all -1, S = -3, sum is (9 -3)/2=3, same as all +1. So in this case, the minimal sum is -1 when S=1 or S=-1, which is indeed the minimal possible sum. So the logic holds here.

Therefore, applying the same logic to 95 numbers, since we can achieve S=1 or S=-1, then the minimal sum is -47. Therefore, the answer should be \boxed{-47}.

But wait, let me think again. Wait, when S=1, the sum is (1 -95)/2 = (-94)/2 = -47, which is correct. But just to make sure, let&#x27;s test with 5 elements. Let&#x27;s say 3 +1s and 2 -1s. Then S = 3 -2 =1. Then sum of products: (1^2 -5)/2 = (1 -5)/2 = -2. Let&#x27;s compute manually. The products: between the 3 +1s: C(3,2)=3 products, each +1*+1=1. Between the 2 -1s: C(2,1)=1 product, (-1)*(-1)=1. Cross terms between +1 and -1: 3*2=6 products, each +1*(-1)=-1. So total sum: 3*1 +1*1 +6*(-1)=3 +1 -6= -2, which matches. So the formula works here as well.

Therefore, the formula seems valid. Thus, the minimal sum is indeed -47. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{-47}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-47}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given 95 numbers \( a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{95} \) where each number is either +1 or -1, we need to determine the minimum value of the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_{i} a_{j} \).

First, we consider the sum \( S = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \). The square of this sum is given by:
\[
S^2 = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \right)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j
\]
Since each \( a_i \) is either +1 or -1, we have \( a_i^2 = 1 \). Therefore:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 = 95
\]
Substituting this into the equation for \( S^2 \), we get:
\[
S^2 = 95 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j
\]
Solving for the desired sum, we find:
\[
\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{S^2 - 95}{2}
\]
To minimize this sum, we need to minimize \( S^2 \). Since \( S \) is the sum of 95 terms each of which is ±1, \( S \) must be an odd integer. The smallest possible absolute value of \( S \) is 1. 

If \( S = 1 \) or \( S = -1 \), then \( S^2 = 1 \). Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{1 - 95}{2} = \frac{-94}{2} = -47
\]

Thus, the minimum value of the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_{i} a_{j} \) is \(\boxed{-47}\).          </p>

Therefore, S is an odd integer. Therefore, the minimal |S| is 1, because you can&#x27;t have an odd integer sum of 95 ±1s equal to 0. So the smallest possible |S| is 1.

Since each \( a_i \) is either +1 or -1, we have \( a_i^2 = 1 \). Therefore:

So, \( S^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j \). But each \(a_i\) is either +1 or -1, so \(a_i^2 = 1\) for all i. Therefore, \( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 = 95 \times 1 = 95 \).

So substituting back, \( S^2 = 95 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j \). Therefore, the sum we need is \( \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{S^2 - 95}{2} \).

Okay, so the problem reduces to minimizing \( \frac{S^2 - 95}{2} \). Since the denominator is 2, the minimum of this expression occurs when \( S^2 \) is as small as possible. Therefore, we need to minimize \( S^2 \), which is equivalent to minimizing the absolute value of \( S \), because square is a non-negative function.

But \( S \) is the sum of 95 terms each of which is ±1. So, \( S \) must be an odd integer because we have an odd number of terms. Wait, 95 is odd. If you add an odd number of ±1s, the result is odd. Because, for example, if you have k +1s and (95 - k) -1s, then the sum S = k*1 + (95 - k)*(-1) = k - (95 - k) = 2k - 95. Since 95 is odd, 2k is even, so even minus odd is odd. Therefore, S is an odd integer. Therefore, the minimal |S| is 1, because you can&#x27;t have an odd integer sum of 95 ±1s equal to 0. So the smallest possible |S| is 1.

But wait, if we can get S = ±1, then S² = 1, so the sum becomes (1 - 95)/2 = (-94)/2 = -47. So the minimal value would be -47. But is that correct? Wait, let me check again.

Wait, first, is it possible to have S = 1? Let&#x27;s see. Let&#x27;s suppose we have k +1s and (95 - k) -1s. Then S = 2k - 95. If S = 1, then 2k - 95 = 1, so 2k = 96, so k = 48. So 48 +1s and 95 - 48 = 47 -1s. Therefore, that&#x27;s possible. Similarly, if S = -1, then 2k - 95 = -1, so 2k = 94, so k = 47. So 47 +1s and 48 -1s. Therefore, yes, it&#x27;s possible to have S = ±1.

Therefore, if we can achieve S = ±1, then the sum would be (1 - 95)/2 = -47. Therefore, the minimal value is -47. But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum value. So is this the minimal value? Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_i a_j \) is equal to \( \frac{S^2 - 95}{2} \). Since S² is non-negative, the minimal value occurs when S² is as small as possible. Since the minimal S² is 1, then the minimal sum is (1 - 95)/2 = -47. But let me check if S can be 1.

But wait, suppose instead that S is larger. For example, if S is 3, then the sum would be (9 - 95)/2 = -43, which is larger than -47. If S is 5, sum is (25 - 95)/2 = -35, which is even larger. So the smaller the S², the smaller the sum. Therefore, the minimal sum is indeed achieved when S² is minimal, which is 1, giving sum -47.

But let me check again with a small example. Suppose instead of 95 elements, let&#x27;s take 3 elements. If all are +1, then S = 3, sum of products is 3 choose 2 = 3. Alternatively, if two +1 and one -1, then S = 2 -1 =1, sum of products would be (1^2 -3)/2 = (1 -3)/2 = -1. Let&#x27;s compute manually: The products would be (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1, which matches. If all -1, S = -3, sum is (9 -3)/2=3, same as all +1. So in this case, the minimal sum is -1 when S=1 or S=-1, which is indeed the minimal possible sum. So the logic holds here.

Therefore, applying the same logic to 95 numbers, since we can achieve S=1 or S=-1, then the minimal sum is -47. Therefore, the answer should be \boxed{-47}.

But wait, let me think again. Wait, when S=1, the sum is (1 -95)/2 = (-94)/2 = -47, which is correct. But just to make sure, let&#x27;s test with 5 elements. Let&#x27;s say 3 +1s and 2 -1s. Then S = 3 -2 =1. Then sum of products: (1^2 -5)/2 = (1 -5)/2 = -2. Let&#x27;s compute manually. The products: between the 3 +1s: C(3,2)=3 products, each +1*+1=1. Between the 2 -1s: C(2,1)=1 product, (-1)*(-1)=1. Cross terms between +1 and -1: 3*2=6 products, each +1*(-1)=-1. So total sum: 3*1 +1*1 +6*(-1)=3 +1 -6= -2, which matches. So the formula works here as well.

Therefore, the formula seems valid. Thus, the minimal sum is indeed -47. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{-47}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-47}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given 95 numbers \( a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{95} \) where each number is either +1 or -1, we need to determine the minimum value of the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_{i} a_{j} \).

First, we consider the sum \( S = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \). The square of this sum is given by:
\[
S^2 = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \right)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j
\]
Since each \( a_i \) is either +1 or -1, we have \( a_i^2 = 1 \). Therefore:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 = 95
\]
Substituting this into the equation for \( S^2 \), we get:
\[
S^2 = 95 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j
\]
Solving for the desired sum, we find:
\[
\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{S^2 - 95}{2}
\]
To minimize this sum, we need to minimize \( S^2 \). Since \( S \) is the sum of 95 terms each of which is ±1, \( S \) must be an odd integer. The smallest possible absolute value of \( S \) is 1. 

If \( S = 1 \) or \( S = -1 \), then \( S^2 = 1 \). Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{1 - 95}{2} = \frac{-94}{2} = -47
\]

Thus, the minimum value of the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_{i} a_{j} \) is \(\boxed{-47}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have 95 numbers, each of which is either +1 or -1. We need to find the minimum value of the sum of all products \(a_i a_j\) where \(1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95\). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, we consider the sum \( S = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \). The square of this sum is given by:
\[
S^2 = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \right)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j
\]
Since each \( a_i \) is either +1 or -1, we have \( a_i^2 = 1 \). Therefore:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 = 95
\]
Substituting this into the equation for \( S^2 \), we get:
\[
S^2 = 95 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j
\]
Solving for the desired sum, we find:
\[
\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{S^2 - 95}{2}
\]
To minimize this sum, we need to minimize \( S^2 \). Since \( S \) is the sum of 95 terms each of which is ±1, \( S \) must be an odd integer. The smallest possible absolute value of \( S \) is 1. 

If \( S = 1 \) or \( S = -1 \), then \( S^2 = 1 \). Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{1 - 95}{2} = \frac{-94}{2} = -47
\]

Thus, the minimum value of the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_{i} a_{j} \) is \(\boxed{-47}\).          </p>

Response: A sum is a good thing, right? We know that we will get the maximum when all of the terms are positive.

Reference Answer: Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have 95 numbers, each of which is either +1 or -1. We need to find the minimum value of the sum of all products \(a_i a_j\) where \(1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95\). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me recall that when dealing with sums of products of variables that are ±1, there might be some clever algebraic manipulation or identity that can simplify the problem. Maybe expanding a square or something like that. Let me try to remember.

Wait, the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_i a_j \) looks familiar. If I consider the square of the sum of all the \(a_i\), let&#x27;s denote \( S = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \). Then, \( S^2 = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \right)^2 \). Expanding this square would give me \( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j \). Right?

So, \( S^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j \). But each \(a_i\) is either +1 or -1, so \(a_i^2 = 1\) for all i. Therefore, \( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 = 95 \times 1 = 95 \).

So substituting back, \( S^2 = 95 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j \). Therefore, the sum we need is \( \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{S^2 - 95}{2} \).

Okay, so the problem reduces to minimizing \( \frac{S^2 - 95}{2} \). Since the denominator is 2, the minimum of this expression occurs when \( S^2 \) is as small as possible. Therefore, we need to minimize \( S^2 \), which is equivalent to minimizing the absolute value of \( S \), because square is a non-negative function.

But \( S \) is the sum of 95 terms each of which is ±1. So, \( S \) must be an odd integer because we have an odd number of terms. Wait, 95 is odd. If you add an odd number of ±1s, the result is odd. Because, for example, if you have k +1s and (95 - k) -1s, then the sum S = k*1 + (95 - k)*(-1) = k - (95 - k) = 2k - 95. Since 95 is odd, 2k is even, so even minus odd is odd. Therefore, S is an odd integer. Therefore, the minimal |S| is 1, because you can&#x27;t have an odd integer sum of 95 ±1s equal to 0. So the smallest possible |S| is 1.

But wait, if we can get S = ±1, then S² = 1, so the sum becomes (1 - 95)/2 = (-94)/2 = -47. So the minimal value would be -47. But is that correct? Wait, let me check again.

Wait, first, is it possible to have S = 1? Let&#x27;s see. Let&#x27;s suppose we have k +1s and (95 - k) -1s. Then S = 2k - 95. If S = 1, then 2k - 95 = 1, so 2k = 96, so k = 48. So 48 +1s and 95 - 48 = 47 -1s. Therefore, that&#x27;s possible. Similarly, if S = -1, then 2k - 95 = -1, so 2k = 94, so k = 47. So 47 +1s and 48 -1s. Therefore, yes, it&#x27;s possible to have S = ±1.

Therefore, if we can achieve S = ±1, then the sum would be (1 - 95)/2 = -47. Therefore, the minimal value is -47. But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum value. So is this the minimal value? Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_i a_j \) is equal to \( \frac{S^2 - 95}{2} \). Since S² is non-negative, the minimal value occurs when S² is as small as possible. Since the minimal S² is 1, then the minimal sum is (1 - 95)/2 = -47. But let me check if S can be 1.

But wait, suppose instead that S is larger. For example, if S is 3, then the sum would be (9 - 95)/2 = -43, which is larger than -47. If S is 5, sum is (25 - 95)/2 = -35, which is even larger. So the smaller the S², the smaller the sum. Therefore, the minimal sum is indeed achieved when S² is minimal, which is 1, giving sum -47.

But let me check again with a small example. Suppose instead of 95 elements, let&#x27;s take 3 elements. If all are +1, then S = 3, sum of products is 3 choose 2 = 3. Alternatively, if two +1 and one -1, then S = 2 -1 =1, sum of products would be (1^2 -3)/2 = (1 -3)/2 = -1. Let&#x27;s compute manually: The products would be (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1, which matches. If all -1, S = -3, sum is (9 -3)/2=3, same as all +1. So in this case, the minimal sum is -1 when S=1 or S=-1, which is indeed the minimal possible sum. So the logic holds here.

Therefore, applying the same logic to 95 numbers, since we can achieve S=1 or S=-1, then the minimal sum is -47. Therefore, the answer should be \boxed{-47}.

But wait, let me think again. Wait, when S=1, the sum is (1 -95)/2 = (-94)/2 = -47, which is correct. But just to make sure, let&#x27;s test with 5 elements. Let&#x27;s say 3 +1s and 2 -1s. Then S = 3 -2 =1. Then sum of products: (1^2 -5)/2 = (1 -5)/2 = -2. Let&#x27;s compute manually. The products: between the 3 +1s: C(3,2)=3 products, each +1*+1=1. Between the 2 -1s: C(2,1)=1 product, (-1)*(-1)=1. Cross terms between +1 and -1: 3*2=6 products, each +1*(-1)=-1. So total sum: 3*1 +1*1 +6*(-1)=3 +1 -6= -2, which matches. So the formula works here as well.

Therefore, the formula seems valid. Thus, the minimal sum is indeed -47. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{-47}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-47}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given 95 numbers \( a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{95} \) where each number is either +1 or -1, we need to determine the minimum value of the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_{i} a_{j} \).

First, we consider the sum \( S = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \). The square of this sum is given by:
\[
S^2 = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \right)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j
\]
Since each \( a_i \) is either +1 or -1, we have \( a_i^2 = 1 \). Therefore:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 = 95
\]
Substituting this into the equation for \( S^2 \), we get:
\[
S^2 = 95 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j
\]
Solving for the desired sum, we find:
\[
\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{S^2 - 95}{2}
\]
To minimize this sum, we need to minimize \( S^2 \). Since \( S \) is the sum of 95 terms each of which is ±1, \( S \) must be an odd integer. The smallest possible absolute value of \( S \) is 1. 

If \( S = 1 \) or \( S = -1 \), then \( S^2 = 1 \). Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{1 - 95}{2} = \frac{-94}{2} = -47
\]

Thus, the minimum value of the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_{i} a_{j} \) is \(\boxed{-47}\).          </p>

Since each \( a_i \) is either +1 or -1, we have \( a_i^2 = 1 \). Therefore:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 = 95
\]
Substituting this into the equation for \( S^2 \), we get:
\[
S^2 = 95 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j
\]
Solving for the desired sum, we find:
\[
\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{S^2 - 95}{2}
\]
To minimize this sum, we need to minimize \( S^2 \). Since \( S \) is the sum of 95 terms each of which is ±1, \( S \) must be an odd integer. The smallest possible absolute value of \( S \) is 1. 

If \( S = 1 \) or \( S = -1 \), then \( S^2 = 1 \). Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{1 - 95}{2} = \frac{-94}{2} = -47
\]

Thus, the minimum value of the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_{i} a_{j} \) is \(\boxed{-47}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have 95 numbers, each of which is either +1 or -1. We need to find the minimum value of the sum of all products \(a_i a_j\) where \(1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95\). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me recall that when dealing with sums of products of variables that are ±1, there might be some clever algebraic manipulation or identity that can simplify the problem. Maybe expanding a square or something like that. Let me try to remember.

Wait, the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_i a_j \) looks familiar. If I consider the square of the sum of all the \(a_i\), let&#x27;s denote \( S = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \). Then, \( S^2 = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \right)^2 \). Expanding this square would give me \( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j \). Right?

So, \( S^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j \). But each \(a_i\) is either +1 or -1, so \(a_i^2 = 1\) for all i. Therefore, \( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 = 95 \times 1 = 95 \).

So substituting back, \( S^2 = 95 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j \). Therefore, the sum we need is \( \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{S^2 - 95}{2} \).

Okay, so the problem reduces to minimizing \( \frac{S^2 - 95}{2} \). Since the denominator is 2, the minimum of this expression occurs when \( S^2 \) is as small as possible. Therefore, we need to minimize \( S^2 \), which is equivalent to minimizing the absolute value of \( S \), because square is a non-negative function.

But \( S \) is the sum of 95 terms each of which is ±1. So, \( S \) must be an odd integer because we have an odd number of terms. Wait, 95 is odd. If you add an odd number of ±1s, the result is odd. Because, for example, if you have k +1s and (95 - k) -1s, then the sum S = k*1 + (95 - k)*(-1) = k - (95 - k) = 2k - 95. Since 95 is odd, 2k is even, so even minus odd is odd. Therefore, S is an odd integer. Therefore, the minimal |S| is 1, because you can&#x27;t have an odd integer sum of 95 ±1s equal to 0. So the smallest possible |S| is 1.

But wait, if we can get S = ±1, then S² = 1, so the sum becomes (1 - 95)/2 = (-94)/2 = -47. So the minimal value would be -47. But is that correct? Wait, let me check again.

Wait, first, is it possible to have S = 1? Let&#x27;s see. Let&#x27;s suppose we have k +1s and (95 - k) -1s. Then S = 2k - 95. If S = 1, then 2k - 95 = 1, so 2k = 96, so k = 48. So 48 +1s and 95 - 48 = 47 -1s. Therefore, that&#x27;s possible. Similarly, if S = -1, then 2k - 95 = -1, so 2k = 94, so k = 47. So 47 +1s and 48 -1s. Therefore, yes, it&#x27;s possible to have S = ±1.

Therefore, if we can achieve S = ±1, then the sum would be (1 - 95)/2 = -47. Therefore, the minimal value is -47. But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum value. So is this the minimal value? Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_i a_j \) is equal to \( \frac{S^2 - 95}{2} \). Since S² is non-negative, the minimal value occurs when S² is as small as possible. Since the minimal S² is 1, then the minimal sum is (1 - 95)/2 = -47. But let me check if S can be 1.

But wait, suppose instead that S is larger. For example, if S is 3, then the sum would be (9 - 95)/2 = -43, which is larger than -47. If S is 5, sum is (25 - 95)/2 = -35, which is even larger. So the smaller the S², the smaller the sum. Therefore, the minimal sum is indeed achieved when S² is minimal, which is 1, giving sum -47.

But let me check again with a small example. Suppose instead of 95 elements, let&#x27;s take 3 elements. If all are +1, then S = 3, sum of products is 3 choose 2 = 3. Alternatively, if two +1 and one -1, then S = 2 -1 =1, sum of products would be (1^2 -3)/2 = (1 -3)/2 = -1. Let&#x27;s compute manually: The products would be (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1, which matches. If all -1, S = -3, sum is (9 -3)/2=3, same as all +1. So in this case, the minimal sum is -1 when S=1 or S=-1, which is indeed the minimal possible sum. So the logic holds here.

Therefore, applying the same logic to 95 numbers, since we can achieve S=1 or S=-1, then the minimal sum is -47. Therefore, the answer should be \boxed{-47}.

But wait, let me think again. Wait, when S=1, the sum is (1 -95)/2 = (-94)/2 = -47, which is correct. But just to make sure, let&#x27;s test with 5 elements. Let&#x27;s say 3 +1s and 2 -1s. Then S = 3 -2 =1. Then sum of products: (1^2 -5)/2 = (1 -5)/2 = -2. Let&#x27;s compute manually. The products: between the 3 +1s: C(3,2)=3 products, each +1*+1=1. Between the 2 -1s: C(2,1)=1 product, (-1)*(-1)=1. Cross terms between +1 and -1: 3*2=6 products, each +1*(-1)=-1. So total sum: 3*1 +1*1 +6*(-1)=3 +1 -6= -2, which matches. So the formula works here as well.

Therefore, the formula seems valid. Thus, the minimal sum is indeed -47. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{-47}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-47}

Given 95 numbers \( a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{95} \) where each number is either +1 or -1, we need to determine the minimum value of the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_{i} a_{j} \).

First, we consider the sum \( S = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \). The square of this sum is given by:
\[
S^2 = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \right)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j
\]
Since each \( a_i \) is either +1 or -1, we have \( a_i^2 = 1 \). Therefore:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 = 95
\]
Substituting this into the equation for \( S^2 \), we get:
\[
S^2 = 95 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j
\]
Solving for the desired sum, we find:
\[
\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{S^2 - 95}{2}
\]
To minimize this sum, we need to minimize \( S^2 \). Since \( S \) is the sum of 95 terms each of which is ±1, \( S \) must be an odd integer. The smallest possible absolute value of \( S \) is 1. 

If \( S = 1 \) or \( S = -1 \), then \( S^2 = 1 \). Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{1 - 95}{2} = \frac{-94}{2} = -47
\]

Thus, the minimum value of the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_{i} a_{j} \) is \(\boxed{-47}\).          </p>

Alternatively, if two +1 and one -1, then S = 2 -1 =1, sum of products would be (1^2 -3)/2 = (1 -3)/2 = -1. Let&#x27;s compute manually: The products would be (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1, which matches. If all -1, S = -3, sum is (9 -3)/2=3, same as all +1. So in this case, the minimal sum is -1 when S=1 or S=-1, which is indeed the minimal possible sum. So the logic holds here.

Therefore, applying the same logic to 95 numbers, since we can achieve S=1 or S=-1, then the minimal sum is -47. Therefore, the answer should be \boxed{-47}.

But wait, let me think again. Wait, when S=1, the sum is (1 -95)/2 = (-94)/2 = -47, which is correct. But just to make sure, let&#x27;s test with 5 elements. Let&#x27;s say 3 +1s and 2 -1s. Then S = 3 -2 =1. Then sum of products: (1^2 -5)/2 = (1 -5)/2 = -2. Let&#x27;s compute manually. The products: between the 3 +1s: C(3,2)=3 products, each +1*+1=1. Between the 2 -1s: C(2,1)=1 product, (-1)*(-1)=1. Cross terms between +1 and -1: 3*2=6 products, each +1*(-1)=-1. So total sum: 3*1 +1*1 +6*(-1)=3 +1 -6= -2, which matches. So the formula works here as well.

Therefore, the formula seems valid. Thus, the minimal sum is indeed -47. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{-47}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-47}

Given 95 numbers \( a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{95} \) where each number is either +1 or -1, we need to determine the minimum value of the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_{i} a_{j} \).

First, we consider the sum \( S = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \). The square of this sum is given by:
\[
S^2 = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \right)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j
\]
Since each \( a_i \) is either +1 or -1, we have \( a_i^2 = 1 \). Therefore:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 = 95
\]
Substituting this into the equation for \( S^2 \), we get:
\[
S^2 = 95 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j
\]
Solving for the desired sum, we find:
\[
\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{S^2 - 95}{2}
\]
To minimize this sum, we need to minimize \( S^2 \). Since \( S \) is the sum of 95 terms each of which is ±1, \( S \) must be an odd integer. The smallest possible absolute value of \( S \) is 1. 

If \( S = 1 \) or \( S = -1 \), then \( S^2 = 1 \). Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{1 - 95}{2} = \frac{-94}{2} = -47
\]

Thus, the minimum value of the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_{i} a_{j} \) is \(\boxed{-47}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have 95 numbers, each of which is either +1 or -1. We need to find the minimum value of the sum of all products \(a_i a_j\) where \(1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95\). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me recall that when dealing with sums of products of variables that are ±1, there might be some clever algebraic manipulation or identity that can simplify the problem. Maybe expanding a square or something like that. Let me try to remember.

Wait, the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_i a_j \) looks familiar. If I consider the square of the sum of all the \(a_i\), let&#x27;s denote \( S = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \). Then, \( S^2 = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \right)^2 \). Expanding this square would give me \( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j \). Right?

So, \( S^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j \). But each \(a_i\) is either +1 or -1, so \(a_i^2 = 1\) for all i. Therefore, \( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 = 95 \times 1 = 95 \).

So substituting back, \( S^2 = 95 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j \). Therefore, the sum we need is \( \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{S^2 - 95}{2} \).

Okay, so the problem reduces to minimizing \( \frac{S^2 - 95}{2} \). Since the denominator is 2, the minimum of this expression occurs when \( S^2 \) is as small as possible. Therefore, we need to minimize \( S^2 \), which is equivalent to minimizing the absolute value of \( S \), because square is a non-negative function.

But \( S \) is the sum of 95 terms each of which is ±1. So, \( S \) must be an odd integer because we have an odd number of terms. Wait, 95 is odd. If you add an odd number of ±1s, the result is odd. Because, for example, if you have k +1s and (95 - k) -1s, then the sum S = k*1 + (95 - k)*(-1) = k - (95 - k) = 2k - 95. Since 95 is odd, 2k is even, so even minus odd is odd. Therefore, S is an odd integer. Therefore, the minimal |S| is 1, because you can&#x27;t have an odd integer sum of 95 ±1s equal to 0. So the smallest possible |S| is 1.

But wait, if we can get S = ±1, then S² = 1, so the sum becomes (1 - 95)/2 = (-94)/2 = -47. So the minimal value would be -47. But is that correct? Wait, let me check again.

Wait, first, is it possible to have S = 1? Let&#x27;s see. Let&#x27;s suppose we have k +1s and (95 - k) -1s. Then S = 2k - 95. If S = 1, then 2k - 95 = 1, so 2k = 96, so k = 48. So 48 +1s and 95 - 48 = 47 -1s. Therefore, that&#x27;s possible. Similarly, if S = -1, then 2k - 95 = -1, so 2k = 94, so k = 47. So 47 +1s and 48 -1s. Therefore, yes, it&#x27;s possible to have S = ±1.

Therefore, if we can achieve S = ±1, then the sum would be (1 - 95)/2 = -47. Therefore, the minimal value is -47. But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum value. So is this the minimal value? Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_i a_j \) is equal to \( \frac{S^2 - 95}{2} \). Since S² is non-negative, the minimal value occurs when S² is as small as possible. Since the minimal S² is 1, then the minimal sum is (1 - 95)/2 = -47. But let me check if S can be 1.

But wait, suppose instead that S is larger. For example, if S is 3, then the sum would be (9 - 95)/2 = -43, which is larger than -47. If S is 5, sum is (25 - 95)/2 = -35, which is even larger. So the smaller the S², the smaller the sum. Therefore, the minimal sum is indeed achieved when S² is minimal, which is 1, giving sum -47.

But let me check again with a small example. Suppose instead of 95 elements, let&#x27;s take 3 elements. If all are +1, then S = 3, sum of products is 3 choose 2 = 3. Alternatively, if two +1 and one -1, then S = 2 -1 =1, sum of products would be (1^2 -3)/2 = (1 -3)/2 = -1. Let&#x27;s compute manually: The products would be (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1, which matches. If all -1, S = -3, sum is (9 -3)/2=3, same as all +1. So in this case, the minimal sum is -1 when S=1 or S=-1, which is indeed the minimal possible sum. So the logic holds here.

Therefore, applying the same logic to 95 numbers, since we can achieve S=1 or S=-1, then the minimal sum is -47. Therefore, the answer should be \boxed{-47}.

Because, for example, if you have k +1s and (95 - k) -1s, then the sum S = k*1 + (95 - k)*(-1) = k - (95 - k) = 2k - 95. Since 95 is odd, 2k is even, so even minus odd is odd. Therefore, S is an odd integer. Therefore, the minimal |S| is 1, because you can&#x27;t have an odd integer sum of 95 ±1s equal to 0. So the smallest possible |S| is 1.

So 48 +1s and 95 - 48 = 47 -1s. Therefore, that&#x27;s possible. Similarly, if S = -1, then 2k - 95 = -1, so 2k = 94, so k = 47. So 47 +1s and 48 -1s. Therefore, yes, it&#x27;s possible to have S = ±1.

So the smaller the S², the smaller the sum. Therefore, the minimal sum is indeed achieved when S² is minimal, which is 1, giving sum -47.

First, we consider the sum \( S = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \). The square of this sum is given by:

S^2 = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \right)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j

Since each \( a_i \) is either +1 or -1, we have \( a_i^2 = 1 \). Therefore:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 = 95

Substituting this into the equation for \( S^2 \), we get:
\[
S^2 = 95 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j

Solving for the desired sum, we find:
\[
\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{S^2 - 95}{2}

To minimize this sum, we need to minimize \( S^2 \). Since \( S \) is the sum of 95 terms each of which is ±1, \( S \) must be an odd integer. The smallest possible absolute value of \( S \) is 1. 

If \( S = 1 \) or \( S = -1 \), then \( S^2 = 1 \). Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{1 - 95}{2} = \frac{-94}{2} = -47

When solving a problem, it is important to make sure they are correctly solved. That includes checking whether their mathematical understanding is correct. In the image above, the parent’s expected number of grandchildren is a mathematical expression. What is the expected value of \(s\)? Explain your answer in the answering text box below. Be sure to state the \(s\) you are specifically using. Why is your answer correct?

Checking whether the answer is mathematically correct can be very difficult with just eyesight alone.
∠ABE = 2x + 7 \(\rightarrow \) x = 28
115 + b = 115(x-7) \(\rightarrow \) b = 48
190 - h = 190(28) - 21 \(\rightarrow \) h = 155

Reference Answer: Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have 95 numbers, each of which is either +1 or -1. We need to find the minimum value of the sum of all products \(a_i a_j\) where \(1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95\). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me recall that when dealing with sums of products of variables that are ±1, there might be some clever algebraic manipulation or identity that can simplify the problem. Maybe expanding a square or something like that. Let me try to remember.

Wait, the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_i a_j \) looks familiar. If I consider the square of the sum of all the \(a_i\), let&#x27;s denote \( S = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \). Then, \( S^2 = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \right)^2 \). Expanding this square would give me \( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j \). Right?

So, \( S^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j \). But each \(a_i\) is either +1 or -1, so \(a_i^2 = 1\) for all i. Therefore, \( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 = 95 \times 1 = 95 \).

So substituting back, \( S^2 = 95 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j \). Therefore, the sum we need is \( \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{S^2 - 95}{2} \).

Okay, so the problem reduces to minimizing \( \frac{S^2 - 95}{2} \). Since the denominator is 2, the minimum of this expression occurs when \( S^2 \) is as small as possible. Therefore, we need to minimize \( S^2 \), which is equivalent to minimizing the absolute value of \( S \), because square is a non-negative function.

But \( S \) is the sum of 95 terms each of which is ±1. So, \( S \) must be an odd integer because we have an odd number of terms. Wait, 95 is odd. If you add an odd number of ±1s, the result is odd. Because, for example, if you have k +1s and (95 - k) -1s, then the sum S = k*1 + (95 - k)*(-1) = k - (95 - k) = 2k - 95. Since 95 is odd, 2k is even, so even minus odd is odd. Therefore, S is an odd integer. Therefore, the minimal |S| is 1, because you can&#x27;t have an odd integer sum of 95 ±1s equal to 0. So the smallest possible |S| is 1.

But wait, if we can get S = ±1, then S² = 1, so the sum becomes (1 - 95)/2 = (-94)/2 = -47. So the minimal value would be -47. But is that correct? Wait, let me check again.

Wait, first, is it possible to have S = 1? Let&#x27;s see. Let&#x27;s suppose we have k +1s and (95 - k) -1s. Then S = 2k - 95. If S = 1, then 2k - 95 = 1, so 2k = 96, so k = 48. So 48 +1s and 95 - 48 = 47 -1s. Therefore, that&#x27;s possible. Similarly, if S = -1, then 2k - 95 = -1, so 2k = 94, so k = 47. So 47 +1s and 48 -1s. Therefore, yes, it&#x27;s possible to have S = ±1.

Therefore, if we can achieve S = ±1, then the sum would be (1 - 95)/2 = -47. Therefore, the minimal value is -47. But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum value. So is this the minimal value? Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_i a_j \) is equal to \( \frac{S^2 - 95}{2} \). Since S² is non-negative, the minimal value occurs when S² is as small as possible. Since the minimal S² is 1, then the minimal sum is (1 - 95)/2 = -47. But let me check if S can be 1.

But wait, suppose instead that S is larger. For example, if S is 3, then the sum would be (9 - 95)/2 = -43, which is larger than -47. If S is 5, sum is (25 - 95)/2 = -35, which is even larger. So the smaller the S², the smaller the sum. Therefore, the minimal sum is indeed achieved when S² is minimal, which is 1, giving sum -47.

But let me check again with a small example. Suppose instead of 95 elements, let&#x27;s take 3 elements. If all are +1, then S = 3, sum of products is 3 choose 2 = 3. Alternatively, if two +1 and one -1, then S = 2 -1 =1, sum of products would be (1^2 -3)/2 = (1 -3)/2 = -1. Let&#x27;s compute manually: The products would be (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1, which matches. If all -1, S = -3, sum is (9 -3)/2=3, same as all +1. So in this case, the minimal sum is -1 when S=1 or S=-1, which is indeed the minimal possible sum. So the logic holds here.

Therefore, applying the same logic to 95 numbers, since we can achieve S=1 or S=-1, then the minimal sum is -47. Therefore, the answer should be \boxed{-47}.

But wait, let me think again. Wait, when S=1, the sum is (1 -95)/2 = (-94)/2 = -47, which is correct. But just to make sure, let&#x27;s test with 5 elements. Let&#x27;s say 3 +1s and 2 -1s. Then S = 3 -2 =1. Then sum of products: (1^2 -5)/2 = (1 -5)/2 = -2. Let&#x27;s compute manually. The products: between the 3 +1s: C(3,2)=3 products, each +1*+1=1. Between the 2 -1s: C(2,1)=1 product, (-1)*(-1)=1. Cross terms between +1 and -1: 3*2=6 products, each +1*(-1)=-1. So total sum: 3*1 +1*1 +6*(-1)=3 +1 -6= -2, which matches. So the formula works here as well.

Therefore, the formula seems valid. Thus, the minimal sum is indeed -47. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{-47}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-47}

Given 95 numbers \( a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{95} \) where each number is either +1 or -1, we need to determine the minimum value of the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_{i} a_{j} \).

First, we consider the sum \( S = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \). The square of this sum is given by:
\[
S^2 = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \right)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j
\]
Since each \( a_i \) is either +1 or -1, we have \( a_i^2 = 1 \). Therefore:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 = 95
\]
Substituting this into the equation for \( S^2 \), we get:
\[
S^2 = 95 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j
\]
Solving for the desired sum, we find:
\[
\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{S^2 - 95}{2}
\]
To minimize this sum, we need to minimize \( S^2 \). Since \( S \) is the sum of 95 terms each of which is ±1, \( S \) must be an odd integer. The smallest possible absolute value of \( S \) is 1. 

If \( S = 1 \) or \( S = -1 \), then \( S^2 = 1 \). Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{1 - 95}{2} = \frac{-94}{2} = -47
\]

Thus, the minimum value of the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_{i} a_{j} \) is \(\boxed{-47}\).          </p>

But wait, if we can get S = ±1, then S² = 1, so the sum becomes (1 - 95)/2 = (-94)/2 = -47. So the minimal value would be -47. But is that correct? Wait, let me check again.

Wait, first, is it possible to have S = 1? Let&#x27;s see. Let&#x27;s suppose we have k +1s and (95 - k) -1s. Then S = 2k - 95. If S = 1, then 2k - 95 = 1, so 2k = 96, so k = 48. So 48 +1s and 95 - 48 = 47 -1s. Therefore, that&#x27;s possible. Similarly, if S = -1, then 2k - 95 = -1, so 2k = 94, so k = 47. So 47 +1s and 48 -1s. Therefore, yes, it&#x27;s possible to have S = ±1.

Therefore, if we can achieve S = ±1, then the sum would be (1 - 95)/2 = -47. Therefore, the minimal value is -47. But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum value. So is this the minimal value? Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_i a_j \) is equal to \( \frac{S^2 - 95}{2} \). Since S² is non-negative, the minimal value occurs when S² is as small as possible. Since the minimal S² is 1, then the minimal sum is (1 - 95)/2 = -47. But let me check if S can be 1.

But wait, suppose instead that S is larger. For example, if S is 3, then the sum would be (9 - 95)/2 = -43, which is larger than -47. If S is 5, sum is (25 - 95)/2 = -35, which is even larger. So the smaller the S², the smaller the sum. Therefore, the minimal sum is indeed achieved when S² is minimal, which is 1, giving sum -47.

But let me check again with a small example. Suppose instead of 95 elements, let&#x27;s take 3 elements. If all are +1, then S = 3, sum of products is 3 choose 2 = 3. Alternatively, if two +1 and one -1, then S = 2 -1 =1, sum of products would be (1^2 -3)/2 = (1 -3)/2 = -1. Let&#x27;s compute manually: The products would be (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1, which matches. If all -1, S = -3, sum is (9 -3)/2=3, same as all +1. So in this case, the minimal sum is -1 when S=1 or S=-1, which is indeed the minimal possible sum. So the logic holds here.

Therefore, applying the same logic to 95 numbers, since we can achieve S=1 or S=-1, then the minimal sum is -47. Therefore, the answer should be \boxed{-47}.

But wait, let me think again. Wait, when S=1, the sum is (1 -95)/2 = (-94)/2 = -47, which is correct. But just to make sure, let&#x27;s test with 5 elements. Let&#x27;s say 3 +1s and 2 -1s. Then S = 3 -2 =1. Then sum of products: (1^2 -5)/2 = (1 -5)/2 = -2. Let&#x27;s compute manually. The products: between the 3 +1s: C(3,2)=3 products, each +1*+1=1. Between the 2 -1s: C(2,1)=1 product, (-1)*(-1)=1. Cross terms between +1 and -1: 3*2=6 products, each +1*(-1)=-1. So total sum: 3*1 +1*1 +6*(-1)=3 +1 -6= -2, which matches. So the formula works here as well.

Therefore, the formula seems valid. Thus, the minimal sum is indeed -47. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{-47}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-47}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given 95 numbers \( a_{1}, a_{2}, \cdots, a_{95} \) where each number is either +1 or -1, we need to determine the minimum value of the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_{i} a_{j} \).

First, we consider the sum \( S = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \). The square of this sum is given by:
\[
S^2 = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \right)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j
\]
Since each \( a_i \) is either +1 or -1, we have \( a_i^2 = 1 \). Therefore:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i^2 = 95
\]
Substituting this into the equation for \( S^2 \), we get:
\[
S^2 = 95 + 2 \sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j
\]
Solving for the desired sum, we find:
\[
\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{S^2 - 95}{2}
\]
To minimize this sum, we need to minimize \( S^2 \). Since \( S \) is the sum of 95 terms each of which is ±1, \( S \) must be an odd integer. The smallest possible absolute value of \( S \) is 1. 

If \( S = 1 \) or \( S = -1 \), then \( S^2 = 1 \). Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
\sum_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq 95} a_i a_j = \frac{1 - 95}{2} = \frac{-94}{2} = -47
\]

Thus, the minimum value of the sum \( \sum_{1 \leq i&lt;j \leq 95} a_{i} a_{j} \) is \(\boxed{-47}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if there&#x27;s a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y such that for every x in the interval [a,b], the supremum of f on [a,x] is equal to f(y(x)). Hmm, interesting. Let me break this down.

First, the supremum of f on [a,x] is just the maximum value of f on that interval since f is continuous on a closed interval, right? Because continuous functions on compact intervals attain their maximum and minimum. So, sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = max_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t). Therefore, there must be some point y(x) in [a,x] where f(y(x)) is equal to this maximum.

So y(x) is a function that picks out a point in [a,x] where f attains its maximum. The question is whether y can be discontinuous while f is continuous.

Let me think of some examples. Suppose f is a constant function. Then every point in [a,x] is a maximum, so y(x) could be any function from I to [a,x]. But since f is constant, even if y is discontinuous, f(y(x)) would still be constant, which matches the supremum. However, the problem states that y should be discontinuous. If f is constant, then y could be discontinuous, but maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that f has to be non-constant. So technically, yes, if f is constant, then y can be any function, including a discontinuous one. But maybe the problem is more interesting if f is non-constant. Let me check the problem statement again.

It says &quot;a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y&quot;. So it doesn&#x27;t specify that f must be non-constant, so maybe the answer is yes, and the example is a constant function f and any discontinuous y. But wait, if f is constant, then f(y(x)) is constant, which equals the supremum, which is also constant. So in that case, y can be any function, even a discontinuous one. So this would satisfy the equation. So in this case, such functions exist. But maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So as long as there exists any continuous f (could be constant) and some discontinuous y that works. Since in the case of constant f, y can be discontinuous, then the answer would be yes. But maybe the problem is intended to consider non-constant f? Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe even for non-constant f, can we have a discontinuous y? Let&#x27;s consider a non-constant f. Suppose f is increasing. Then the supremum on [a,x] is f(x), so y(x) must equal x. Then y is continuous, so that&#x27;s not helpful. If f is decreasing, then the supremum on [a,x] is f(a), so y(x) must be a for all x. But then y is constant, hence continuous. So in these cases, y is forced to be continuous.

What if f has a maximum somewhere in the middle? For example, suppose f is a function that increases up to some point c in [a,b] and then decreases. Then the supremum on [a,x] for x ≤ c would be f(x), and for x ≥ c, it would be f(c). So in that case, for x ≥ c, y(x) must be c. But for x &lt; c, y(x) must be x. So y(x) would be x for x &lt; c and c for x ≥ c. Is this function y discontinuous?

At x = c, left limit of y(x) as x approaches c from below is c, and the right limit is c, and y(c) = c, so it&#x27;s continuous at c. So y is continuous here. So even if f has a peak, y is still continuous.

Wait, but what if the maximum is not unique? For example, suppose f is constant on some interval. If f is constant on [a, d] for some d &gt; a, then any y(x) in [a, x] would work for x ≤ d. But if we choose y(x) to jump around, could that make y discontinuous? For example, suppose f is constant on [a, d], then for x in [a, d], y(x) could be a, then jump to some other point in [a, x], but since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the supremum. So in this case, y could be discontinuous on [a, d], but continuous elsewhere. However, the problem requires y to be discontinuous on the entire interval I = [a, b]. So if we only have y discontinuous on a subinterval, is that acceptable?

Wait, the problem states &quot;for all x ∈ I&quot;, so y needs to be defined on I, and the equation has to hold for all x in I. If f is constant on part of the interval, we can make y discontinuous there, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, y might have to be continuous there. So maybe we can construct an f that&#x27;s constant on some part and non-constant on another, allowing y to be discontinuous on the constant part but continuous on the non-constant part. But then y would not be entirely discontinuous on I. The problem requires y to be discontinuous, not necessarily discontinuous everywhere. So if y has at least one point of discontinuity, it&#x27;s considered discontinuous.

So if we have f constant on some subinterval, say [a, c], and non-constant on [c, b], then on [a, c], y can be discontinuous, and on [c, b], y has to be continuous. So overall y is discontinuous. For example, let f be constant on [a, c] and then increasing on [c, b]. Then on [a, c], y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so we can choose y(x) to jump around, like sometimes a, sometimes x, creating discontinuities. Then on [c, b], y(x) must be x. So overall, y would be discontinuous on [a, c] and continuous on [c, b]. But as long as there is at least one point of discontinuity, y is a discontinuous function. So such a function y exists.

But does this satisfy the equation? For x in [a, c], sup f(t) is the constant value, and y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so as long as f is constant on [a, c], f(y(x)) will equal the sup. For x in [c, b], sup f(t) is f(x) since f is increasing there, so y(x) must be x. So if we define y(x) to be, say, a for x in [a, c), and x for x in [c, b], then y is discontinuous at c (since left limit is a, right limit is c, and y(c) = c). So that&#x27;s a discontinuity at c. So this y is discontinuous, and f is continuous (constant on [a, c], increasing on [c, b]). Therefore, this would satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe even simpler: take f to be constant on the entire interval [a, b]. Then y can be any function from [a, b] to [a, b], as long as y(x) is in [a, x]. For example, define y(x) = a for all x except at some point, say x = c, where y(c) = c. Then y is discontinuous at c if we define it that way. Since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the constant value, which equals the sup. So in this case, y is discontinuous (has a jump at c) and f is continuous.

Therefore, such functions do exist. So the answer is yes.

Wait, but the problem says &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So if we can construct even one example where f is continuous and y is discontinuous (even if y is only discontinuous at one point), then the answer is yes. So in the case where f is constant, y can be discontinuous. So yes, such functions exist. So I think the answer is yes, and the example is f constant and y any discontinuous function picking points in [a,x]. But let me verify that.

Suppose f(x) = 1 for all x in [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = 1 for any x. Then we need f(y(x)) = 1, which is true for any y(x) ∈ [a,x] since f(y(x)) =1. So we can choose y(x) to be, for example, a if x is rational, and x if x is irrational. Then y is discontinuous everywhere except possibly at x=a, so y is discontinuous. Therefore, such a function y exists. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But maybe the problem is intended to have f non-constant? Let me check the original problem again. It just says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So even if f is constant, as long as y is discontinuous, that&#x27;s acceptable. Therefore, such a pair exists, so the answer is yes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trickier. Suppose f is not constant. Then can we still have a discontinuous y?

Suppose f is a non-constant continuous function. For example, f(x) = x on [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = f(x) = x. So y(x) must be x. Therefore, y is continuous. So in this case, y must be continuous.

But if f is a non-constant function that attains its maximum at varying points, maybe y can be discontinuous. Wait, but for continuous f, the maximum is attained, and the set of maximum points is a closed set. For example, suppose f is a function that has multiple maxima on some intervals. Wait, but if f is continuous, the set where f attains its maximum on [a,x] could be a single point or multiple points.

Wait, suppose f is such that on some subintervals, the maximum is attained at multiple points. For example, f is a constant on some subintervals. Wait, but even then, if we have to choose y(x) as one of those points, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, then on those parts y(x) has to be continuous.

Wait, maybe f could be a function that has plateaus. For example, f(x) is increasing up to some point, then constant, then decreasing. Then on the increasing part, y(x) =x, on the constant part, y(x) can be any point in [a,x], so we could choose to make y discontinuous there, and on the decreasing part, y(x) must be the point where the plateau is. So overall, y could have discontinuities in the constant part.

But if the problem allows y to be discontinuous only on parts where f is constant, but continuous elsewhere, then overall y is discontinuous. But f is still continuous.

But in this case, even though f is non-constant (since it&#x27;s increasing and decreasing), but with a flat part, we can have a y that&#x27;s discontinuous on the flat part.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. For example, take f(x) = x on [a, c], f(x) = c on [c, d], and f(x) = d - x on [d, b], where a &lt; c &lt; d &lt; b. Then on [a, c], sup f(t) on [a,x] is f(x) =x, so y(x) =x. On [c, d], sup f(t) is f(c) = c, so y(x) can be any point in [a,x] that maps to c. Since c is in [a,x] for x ≥ c, we can choose y(x) = c for x in [c, d]. On [d, b], sup f(t) is still c, so y(x) must be c. Therefore, y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So overall, y(x) is x for x in [a,c), and c for x in [c, b]. This function y(x) is continuous on [a,c) and constant on [c,b], but at x=c, the left limit is c (since approaching from the left, y approaches c), and y(c)=c. So actually, y is continuous at c as well. Wait, no. Wait, for x approaching c from the left, y(x) approaches c, and y(c) = c. So y is continuous at c. Therefore, y is continuous everywhere. So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, so maybe even with a flat part, if we try to make y discontinuous, the requirement that sup f(t) = f(y(x)) forces y(x) to be c for x ≥ c. So y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So if we set y(x) = c for x ≥ c, that&#x27;s continuous. But if we tried to make y(x) jump around in the flat part, but since the sup is still c, y(x) has to be a point where f(y(x))=c. So if f is constant on [c, d], then any y(x) in [c, x] would work, but if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c, sometimes d, but since f is constant on [c,d], then f(y(x)) is still c. So y(x) could be discontinuous on [c, d]. For example, define y(x) = c for rational x in [c,d], and y(x) = d for irrational x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous on [c,d], but on [a,c), y(x)=x, which is continuous. So overall, y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence y is a discontinuous function. Therefore, this would work.

Wait, but when x is in [c,d], y(x) must lie in [a,x], but c ≤ x ≤ d, so if we choose y(x) = c or d, as long as c and d are ≤ x. Wait, but d is greater than c, and x is in [c,d]. So for x in [c,d], if we choose y(x) = d, then d must be ≤ x, but x ≤ d. So y(x)=d only works when x=d. So if x is in [c,d), then d is not ≤ x, so y(x) can&#x27;t be d. Therefore, in this case, if f is constant on [c,d], then for x in [c,d], y(x) must be a point in [a,x] where f(y(x))=c. Since f is c on [c,d], then y(x) can be any point in [c,x], since f(y(x))=c. So if we set y(x) = x for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s continuous. But if we choose y(x) to be c for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s also continuous. But if we set y(x) to sometimes be c and sometimes be other points in [c,x] in a discontinuous way.

For example, let’s define y(x) = c if x is rational, and y(x) = x if x is irrational, for x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous because in any neighborhood of a rational point, there are irrationals where y takes the value x, which approaches the rational point, so the limit would be the rational point, but y at the rational point is c, which is different unless c equals the rational point. Wait, c is a fixed point. Wait, if c is the left endpoint of the interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], if we define y(x) = c for x rational and y(x)=x for x irrational, then at any rational point x0 in [c,d], the function y(x) at x0 is c, but the limit as x approaches x0 from irrationals would be x0, which is not equal to c unless x0 = c. So at x=c, y is continuous because approaching from the right (if c &lt; d), y(x) approaches c (since irrationals approach c, but y(x)=x approaches c, and y(c)=c). But at any x0 &gt; c in [c,d], if x0 is rational, then y(x0)=c, but the limit from the irrationals is x0 ≠ c. So y is discontinuous at every rational point in (c,d]. Similarly, at irrational points x0, y is continuous because approaching from rationals, y approaches c, but y(x0)=x0. Unless c = x0, which only occurs at x0=c. Therefore, y is discontinuous at all rational points in (c,d]. Hence, y is discontinuous on a dense subset of [c,d], hence y is discontinuous everywhere on [c,d] except possibly at c.

Therefore, this y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence discontinuous overall. Therefore, even with a non-constant f (since f increases on [a,c] and is constant on [c,d], then decreases on [d,b]), we can construct a discontinuous y.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. So whether f is constant or not, we can have a discontinuous y. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But to make sure, let me think of another example. Suppose f is a sine wave on [0, 2π], continuous of course. The supremum on [0,x] would be 1 once x reaches π/2, since sin(π/2)=1, and then after that, the supremum remains 1. So for x ≥ π/2, y(x) must be π/2. For x &lt; π/2, y(x) must be x, since sin(x) is increasing on [0, π/2]. Therefore, y(x) is x for x ∈ [0, π/2] and π/2 for x ∈ [π/2, 2π]. This y is continuous, since at π/2, the left limit is π/2 and the right limit is π/2. So y is continuous here. But if we modify y(x) for x ≥ π/2 to sometimes be π/2 and sometimes other points where f is 1. Wait, but after π/2, the maximum is always 1, which is achieved at π/2 and also at 3π/2, but wait, sin(3π/2) is -1, which is not the supremum. Wait, no, on [0, x], for x ≥ π/2, the supremum is 1, achieved only at π/2. Because after π/2, sin decreases to 0 at π, then negative values, so the maximum remains 1. So y(x) must be π/2 for x ≥ π/2. Therefore, y(x) is forced to be π/2 there, hence continuous. So in this case, even with a non-constant f, y is continuous.

So in some cases, even if f is non-constant, y has to be continuous. But in other cases, like when f has a flat part, we can make y discontinuous. Therefore, the existence depends on the function f. But the problem asks whether there exists any continuous f and discontinuous y such that the equation holds. So as long as there is at least one such pair, the answer is yes. Since we have examples where f is constant or has flat parts allowing y to be discontinuous, the answer is yes.

Another angle: suppose f is such that its maximum on [a,x] is not uniquely attained. Then y(x) can choose any maximum point, and by choosing different points in a discontinuous way, y can be made discontinuous. However, for continuous f, the set of maximum points on [a,x] is a closed set, and if the maximum is not unique, it&#x27;s a closed interval. So for example, if f is constant on some interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], the maximum is attained on [c,x], which includes [c,x], so if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c and sometimes x in a discontinuous way, then y would be discontinuous.

But in order for the maximum not to be unique, f needs to be constant on some interval. If f is strictly increasing, then the maximum is unique (at x), so y(x) must be x. If f is non-strictly increasing, like with a flat part, then the maximum is not unique on that flat part.

Therefore, to have a discontinuous y, f must be non-strictly monotonic or have intervals where it&#x27;s constant. Therefore, such f exists, and for those f, we can construct discontinuous y. Hence, the answer is yes.

So, in summary, yes, such functions exist. For example, take f to be constant on [a,b], then any discontinuous y(x) ∈ [a,x] works. Or take f to have a flat part where y can be discontinuous, while keeping f continuous.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether there exists a continuous function \( f \) and a discontinuous function \( y \) such that the equation \(\sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) = f(y(x))\) holds for all \( x \in I = [a, b] \), we analyze the following key points:

1. **Supremum and Maximum**: For a continuous function \( f \) on a closed interval \([a, x]\), the supremum is attained as the maximum value. Therefore, there exists some \( y(x) \in [a, x] \) such that \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

2. **Constant Function Example**: If \( f \) is a constant function, then \( f(y(x)) \) will always equal the constant value for any \( y(x) \in [a, x] \). In this case, \( y(x) \) can be any function, including a discontinuous one. For example, \( y(x) \) could be defined as \( a \) for rational \( x \) and \( x \) for irrational \( x \), resulting in a discontinuous \( y \).

3. **Non-Constant Function Example**: For non-constant continuous functions \( f \) with intervals where \( f \) is constant or has flat parts, \( y(x) \) can be discontinuous on those intervals. For instance, if \( f \) is constant on a subinterval \([c, d]\), \( y(x) \) can jump between different points in \([a, x]\) while still satisfying \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

4. **Verification**: Even if \( f \) is non-constant, as long as there are intervals where the maximum is not uniquely attained (e.g., flat parts), \( y(x) \) can be chosen discontinuously. For example, defining \( y(x) \) to jump between endpoints of the flat part in a discontinuous manner.

Thus, there exist continuous functions \( f \) and discontinuous functions \( y \) that satisfy the given equation. Examples include constant functions with discontinuous \( y \) and non-constant functions with flat parts allowing discontinuous \( y \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if there&#x27;s a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y such that for every x in the interval [a,b], the supremum of f on [a,x] is equal to f(y(x)). Hmm, interesting. Let me break this down.

So if we have f constant on some subinterval, say [a, c], and non-constant on [c, b], then on [a, c], y can be discontinuous, and on [c, b], y has to be continuous. So overall y is discontinuous. For example, let f be constant on [a, c] and then increasing on [c, b]. Then on [a, c], y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so we can choose y(x) to jump around, like sometimes a, sometimes x, creating discontinuities. Then on [c, b], y(x) must be x. So overall, y would be discontinuous on [a, c] and continuous on [c, b]. But as long as there is at least one point of discontinuity, y is a discontinuous function. So such a function y exists.

But does this satisfy the equation? For x in [a, c], sup f(t) is the constant value, and y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so as long as f is constant on [a, c], f(y(x)) will equal the sup. For x in [c, b], sup f(t) is f(x) since f is increasing there, so y(x) must be x. So if we define y(x) to be, say, a for x in [a, c), and x for x in [c, b], then y is discontinuous at c (since left limit is a, right limit is c, and y(c) = c). So that&#x27;s a discontinuity at c. So this y is discontinuous, and f is continuous (constant on [a, c], increasing on [c, b]). Therefore, this would satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe even simpler: take f to be constant on the entire interval [a, b]. Then y can be any function from [a, b] to [a, b], as long as y(x) is in [a, x]. For example, define y(x) = a for all x except at some point, say x = c, where y(c) = c. Then y is discontinuous at c if we define it that way. Since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the constant value, which equals the sup. So in this case, y is discontinuous (has a jump at c) and f is continuous.

Therefore, such functions do exist. So the answer is yes.

Wait, but the problem says &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So if we can construct even one example where f is continuous and y is discontinuous (even if y is only discontinuous at one point), then the answer is yes. So in the case where f is constant, y can be discontinuous. So yes, such functions exist. So I think the answer is yes, and the example is f constant and y any discontinuous function picking points in [a,x]. But let me verify that.

Suppose f(x) = 1 for all x in [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = 1 for any x. Then we need f(y(x)) = 1, which is true for any y(x) ∈ [a,x] since f(y(x)) =1. So we can choose y(x) to be, for example, a if x is rational, and x if x is irrational. Then y is discontinuous everywhere except possibly at x=a, so y is discontinuous. Therefore, such a function y exists. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But maybe the problem is intended to have f non-constant? Let me check the original problem again. It just says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So even if f is constant, as long as y is discontinuous, that&#x27;s acceptable. Therefore, such a pair exists, so the answer is yes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trickier. Suppose f is not constant. Then can we still have a discontinuous y?

Suppose f is a non-constant continuous function. For example, f(x) = x on [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = f(x) = x. So y(x) must be x. Therefore, y is continuous. So in this case, y must be continuous.

But if f is a non-constant function that attains its maximum at varying points, maybe y can be discontinuous. Wait, but for continuous f, the maximum is attained, and the set of maximum points is a closed set. For example, suppose f is a function that has multiple maxima on some intervals. Wait, but if f is continuous, the set where f attains its maximum on [a,x] could be a single point or multiple points.

Wait, suppose f is such that on some subintervals, the maximum is attained at multiple points. For example, f is a constant on some subintervals. Wait, but even then, if we have to choose y(x) as one of those points, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, then on those parts y(x) has to be continuous.

Wait, maybe f could be a function that has plateaus. For example, f(x) is increasing up to some point, then constant, then decreasing. Then on the increasing part, y(x) =x, on the constant part, y(x) can be any point in [a,x], so we could choose to make y discontinuous there, and on the decreasing part, y(x) must be the point where the plateau is. So overall, y could have discontinuities in the constant part.

But if the problem allows y to be discontinuous only on parts where f is constant, but continuous elsewhere, then overall y is discontinuous. But f is still continuous.

But in this case, even though f is non-constant (since it&#x27;s increasing and decreasing), but with a flat part, we can have a y that&#x27;s discontinuous on the flat part.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. For example, take f(x) = x on [a, c], f(x) = c on [c, d], and f(x) = d - x on [d, b], where a &lt; c &lt; d &lt; b. Then on [a, c], sup f(t) on [a,x] is f(x) =x, so y(x) =x. On [c, d], sup f(t) is f(c) = c, so y(x) can be any point in [a,x] that maps to c. Since c is in [a,x] for x ≥ c, we can choose y(x) = c for x in [c, d]. On [d, b], sup f(t) is still c, so y(x) must be c. Therefore, y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So overall, y(x) is x for x in [a,c), and c for x in [c, b]. This function y(x) is continuous on [a,c) and constant on [c,b], but at x=c, the left limit is c (since approaching from the left, y approaches c), and y(c)=c. So actually, y is continuous at c as well. Wait, no. Wait, for x approaching c from the left, y(x) approaches c, and y(c) = c. So y is continuous at c. Therefore, y is continuous everywhere. So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, so maybe even with a flat part, if we try to make y discontinuous, the requirement that sup f(t) = f(y(x)) forces y(x) to be c for x ≥ c. So y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So if we set y(x) = c for x ≥ c, that&#x27;s continuous. But if we tried to make y(x) jump around in the flat part, but since the sup is still c, y(x) has to be a point where f(y(x))=c. So if f is constant on [c, d], then any y(x) in [c, x] would work, but if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c, sometimes d, but since f is constant on [c,d], then f(y(x)) is still c. So y(x) could be discontinuous on [c, d]. For example, define y(x) = c for rational x in [c,d], and y(x) = d for irrational x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous on [c,d], but on [a,c), y(x)=x, which is continuous. So overall, y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence y is a discontinuous function. Therefore, this would work.

Wait, but when x is in [c,d], y(x) must lie in [a,x], but c ≤ x ≤ d, so if we choose y(x) = c or d, as long as c and d are ≤ x. Wait, but d is greater than c, and x is in [c,d]. So for x in [c,d], if we choose y(x) = d, then d must be ≤ x, but x ≤ d. So y(x)=d only works when x=d. So if x is in [c,d), then d is not ≤ x, so y(x) can&#x27;t be d. Therefore, in this case, if f is constant on [c,d], then for x in [c,d], y(x) must be a point in [a,x] where f(y(x))=c. Since f is c on [c,d], then y(x) can be any point in [c,x], since f(y(x))=c. So if we set y(x) = x for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s continuous. But if we choose y(x) to be c for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s also continuous. But if we set y(x) to sometimes be c and sometimes be other points in [c,x] in a discontinuous way.

For example, let’s define y(x) = c if x is rational, and y(x) = x if x is irrational, for x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous because in any neighborhood of a rational point, there are irrationals where y takes the value x, which approaches the rational point, so the limit would be the rational point, but y at the rational point is c, which is different unless c equals the rational point. Wait, c is a fixed point. Wait, if c is the left endpoint of the interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], if we define y(x) = c for x rational and y(x)=x for x irrational, then at any rational point x0 in [c,d], the function y(x) at x0 is c, but the limit as x approaches x0 from irrationals would be x0, which is not equal to c unless x0 = c. So at x=c, y is continuous because approaching from the right (if c &lt; d), y(x) approaches c (since irrationals approach c, but y(x)=x approaches c, and y(c)=c). But at any x0 &gt; c in [c,d], if x0 is rational, then y(x0)=c, but the limit from the irrationals is x0 ≠ c. So y is discontinuous at every rational point in (c,d]. Similarly, at irrational points x0, y is continuous because approaching from rationals, y approaches c, but y(x0)=x0. Unless c = x0, which only occurs at x0=c. Therefore, y is discontinuous at all rational points in (c,d]. Hence, y is discontinuous on a dense subset of [c,d], hence y is discontinuous everywhere on [c,d] except possibly at c.

Therefore, this y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence discontinuous overall. Therefore, even with a non-constant f (since f increases on [a,c] and is constant on [c,d], then decreases on [d,b]), we can construct a discontinuous y.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. So whether f is constant or not, we can have a discontinuous y. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But to make sure, let me think of another example. Suppose f is a sine wave on [0, 2π], continuous of course. The supremum on [0,x] would be 1 once x reaches π/2, since sin(π/2)=1, and then after that, the supremum remains 1. So for x ≥ π/2, y(x) must be π/2. For x &lt; π/2, y(x) must be x, since sin(x) is increasing on [0, π/2]. Therefore, y(x) is x for x ∈ [0, π/2] and π/2 for x ∈ [π/2, 2π]. This y is continuous, since at π/2, the left limit is π/2 and the right limit is π/2. So y is continuous here. But if we modify y(x) for x ≥ π/2 to sometimes be π/2 and sometimes other points where f is 1. Wait, but after π/2, the maximum is always 1, which is achieved at π/2 and also at 3π/2, but wait, sin(3π/2) is -1, which is not the supremum. Wait, no, on [0, x], for x ≥ π/2, the supremum is 1, achieved only at π/2. Because after π/2, sin decreases to 0 at π, then negative values, so the maximum remains 1. So y(x) must be π/2 for x ≥ π/2. Therefore, y(x) is forced to be π/2 there, hence continuous. So in this case, even with a non-constant f, y is continuous.

So in some cases, even if f is non-constant, y has to be continuous. But in other cases, like when f has a flat part, we can make y discontinuous. Therefore, the existence depends on the function f. But the problem asks whether there exists any continuous f and discontinuous y such that the equation holds. So as long as there is at least one such pair, the answer is yes. Since we have examples where f is constant or has flat parts allowing y to be discontinuous, the answer is yes.

Another angle: suppose f is such that its maximum on [a,x] is not uniquely attained. Then y(x) can choose any maximum point, and by choosing different points in a discontinuous way, y can be made discontinuous. However, for continuous f, the set of maximum points on [a,x] is a closed set, and if the maximum is not unique, it&#x27;s a closed interval. So for example, if f is constant on some interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], the maximum is attained on [c,x], which includes [c,x], so if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c and sometimes x in a discontinuous way, then y would be discontinuous.

But in order for the maximum not to be unique, f needs to be constant on some interval. If f is strictly increasing, then the maximum is unique (at x), so y(x) must be x. If f is non-strictly increasing, like with a flat part, then the maximum is not unique on that flat part.

Therefore, to have a discontinuous y, f must be non-strictly monotonic or have intervals where it&#x27;s constant. Therefore, such f exists, and for those f, we can construct discontinuous y. Hence, the answer is yes.

So, in summary, yes, such functions exist. For example, take f to be constant on [a,b], then any discontinuous y(x) ∈ [a,x] works. Or take f to have a flat part where y can be discontinuous, while keeping f continuous.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether there exists a continuous function \( f \) and a discontinuous function \( y \) such that the equation \(\sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) = f(y(x))\) holds for all \( x \in I = [a, b] \), we analyze the following key points:

1. **Supremum and Maximum**: For a continuous function \( f \) on a closed interval \([a, x]\), the supremum is attained as the maximum value. Therefore, there exists some \( y(x) \in [a, x] \) such that \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

2. **Constant Function Example**: If \( f \) is a constant function, then \( f(y(x)) \) will always equal the constant value for any \( y(x) \in [a, x] \). In this case, \( y(x) \) can be any function, including a discontinuous one. For example, \( y(x) \) could be defined as \( a \) for rational \( x \) and \( x \) for irrational \( x \), resulting in a discontinuous \( y \).

3. **Non-Constant Function Example**: For non-constant continuous functions \( f \) with intervals where \( f \) is constant or has flat parts, \( y(x) \) can be discontinuous on those intervals. For instance, if \( f \) is constant on a subinterval \([c, d]\), \( y(x) \) can jump between different points in \([a, x]\) while still satisfying \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

4. **Verification**: Even if \( f \) is non-constant, as long as there are intervals where the maximum is not uniquely attained (e.g., flat parts), \( y(x) \) can be chosen discontinuously. For example, defining \( y(x) \) to jump between endpoints of the flat part in a discontinuous manner.

Thus, there exist continuous functions \( f \) and discontinuous functions \( y \) that satisfy the given equation. Examples include constant functions with discontinuous \( y \) and non-constant functions with flat parts allowing discontinuous \( y \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if there&#x27;s a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y such that for every x in the interval [a,b], the supremum of f on [a,x] is equal to f(y(x)). Hmm, interesting. Let me break this down.

First, the supremum of f on [a,x] is just the maximum value of f on that interval since f is continuous on a closed interval, right? Because continuous functions on compact intervals attain their maximum and minimum. So, sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = max_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t). Therefore, there must be some point y(x) in [a,x] where f(y(x)) is equal to this maximum.

So y(x) is a function that picks out a point in [a,x] where f attains its maximum. The question is whether y can be discontinuous while f is continuous.

Let me think of some examples. Suppose f is a constant function. Then every point in [a,x] is a maximum, so y(x) could be any function from I to [a,x]. But since f is constant, even if y is discontinuous, f(y(x)) would still be constant, which matches the supremum. However, the problem states that y should be discontinuous. If f is constant, then y could be discontinuous, but maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that f has to be non-constant. So technically, yes, if f is constant, then y can be any function, including a discontinuous one. But maybe the problem is more interesting if f is non-constant. Let me check the problem statement again.

It says &quot;a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y&quot;. So it doesn&#x27;t specify that f must be non-constant, so maybe the answer is yes, and the example is a constant function f and any discontinuous y. But wait, if f is constant, then f(y(x)) is constant, which equals the supremum, which is also constant. So in that case, y can be any function, even a discontinuous one. So this would satisfy the equation. So in this case, such functions exist. But maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So as long as there exists any continuous f (could be constant) and some discontinuous y that works. Since in the case of constant f, y can be discontinuous, then the answer would be yes. But maybe the problem is intended to consider non-constant f? Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe even for non-constant f, can we have a discontinuous y? Let&#x27;s consider a non-constant f. Suppose f is increasing. Then the supremum on [a,x] is f(x), so y(x) must equal x. Then y is continuous, so that&#x27;s not helpful. If f is decreasing, then the supremum on [a,x] is f(a), so y(x) must be a for all x. But then y is constant, hence continuous. So in these cases, y is forced to be continuous.

What if f has a maximum somewhere in the middle? For example, suppose f is a function that increases up to some point c in [a,b] and then decreases. Then the supremum on [a,x] for x ≤ c would be f(x), and for x ≥ c, it would be f(c). So in that case, for x ≥ c, y(x) must be c. But for x &lt; c, y(x) must be x. So y(x) would be x for x &lt; c and c for x ≥ c. Is this function y discontinuous?

At x = c, left limit of y(x) as x approaches c from below is c, and the right limit is c, and y(c) = c, so it&#x27;s continuous at c. So y is continuous here. So even if f has a peak, y is still continuous.

Wait, but what if the maximum is not unique? For example, suppose f is constant on some interval. If f is constant on [a, d] for some d &gt; a, then any y(x) in [a, x] would work for x ≤ d. But if we choose y(x) to jump around, could that make y discontinuous? For example, suppose f is constant on [a, d], then for x in [a, d], y(x) could be a, then jump to some other point in [a, x], but since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the supremum. So in this case, y could be discontinuous on [a, d], but continuous elsewhere. However, the problem requires y to be discontinuous on the entire interval I = [a, b]. So if we only have y discontinuous on a subinterval, is that acceptable?

Wait, the problem states &quot;for all x ∈ I&quot;, so y needs to be defined on I, and the equation has to hold for all x in I. If f is constant on part of the interval, we can make y discontinuous there, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, y might have to be continuous there. So maybe we can construct an f that&#x27;s constant on some part and non-constant on another, allowing y to be discontinuous on the constant part but continuous on the non-constant part. But then y would not be entirely discontinuous on I. The problem requires y to be discontinuous, not necessarily discontinuous everywhere. So if y has at least one point of discontinuity, it&#x27;s considered discontinuous.

So if we have f constant on some subinterval, say [a, c], and non-constant on [c, b], then on [a, c], y can be discontinuous, and on [c, b], y has to be continuous. So overall y is discontinuous. For example, let f be constant on [a, c] and then increasing on [c, b]. Then on [a, c], y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so we can choose y(x) to jump around, like sometimes a, sometimes x, creating discontinuities. Then on [c, b], y(x) must be x. So overall, y would be discontinuous on [a, c] and continuous on [c, b]. But as long as there is at least one point of discontinuity, y is a discontinuous function. So such a function y exists.

But does this satisfy the equation? For x in [a, c], sup f(t) is the constant value, and y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so as long as f is constant on [a, c], f(y(x)) will equal the sup. For x in [c, b], sup f(t) is f(x) since f is increasing there, so y(x) must be x. So if we define y(x) to be, say, a for x in [a, c), and x for x in [c, b], then y is discontinuous at c (since left limit is a, right limit is c, and y(c) = c). So that&#x27;s a discontinuity at c. So this y is discontinuous, and f is continuous (constant on [a, c], increasing on [c, b]). Therefore, this would satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe even simpler: take f to be constant on the entire interval [a, b]. Then y can be any function from [a, b] to [a, b], as long as y(x) is in [a, x]. For example, define y(x) = a for all x except at some point, say x = c, where y(c) = c. Then y is discontinuous at c if we define it that way. Since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the constant value, which equals the sup. So in this case, y is discontinuous (has a jump at c) and f is continuous.

Therefore, such functions do exist. So the answer is yes.

Wait, but the problem says &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So if we can construct even one example where f is continuous and y is discontinuous (even if y is only discontinuous at one point), then the answer is yes. So in the case where f is constant, y can be discontinuous. So yes, such functions exist. So I think the answer is yes, and the example is f constant and y any discontinuous function picking points in [a,x]. But let me verify that.

Suppose f(x) = 1 for all x in [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = 1 for any x. Then we need f(y(x)) = 1, which is true for any y(x) ∈ [a,x] since f(y(x)) =1. So we can choose y(x) to be, for example, a if x is rational, and x if x is irrational. Then y is discontinuous everywhere except possibly at x=a, so y is discontinuous. Therefore, such a function y exists. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But maybe the problem is intended to have f non-constant? Let me check the original problem again. It just says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So even if f is constant, as long as y is discontinuous, that&#x27;s acceptable. Therefore, such a pair exists, so the answer is yes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trickier. Suppose f is not constant. Then can we still have a discontinuous y?

Suppose f is a non-constant continuous function. For example, f(x) = x on [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = f(x) = x. So y(x) must be x. Therefore, y is continuous. So in this case, y must be continuous.

But if f is a non-constant function that attains its maximum at varying points, maybe y can be discontinuous. Wait, but for continuous f, the maximum is attained, and the set of maximum points is a closed set. For example, suppose f is a function that has multiple maxima on some intervals. Wait, but if f is continuous, the set where f attains its maximum on [a,x] could be a single point or multiple points.

Wait, suppose f is such that on some subintervals, the maximum is attained at multiple points. For example, f is a constant on some subintervals. Wait, but even then, if we have to choose y(x) as one of those points, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, then on those parts y(x) has to be continuous.

Wait, maybe f could be a function that has plateaus. For example, f(x) is increasing up to some point, then constant, then decreasing. Then on the increasing part, y(x) =x, on the constant part, y(x) can be any point in [a,x], so we could choose to make y discontinuous there, and on the decreasing part, y(x) must be the point where the plateau is. So overall, y could have discontinuities in the constant part.

But if the problem allows y to be discontinuous only on parts where f is constant, but continuous elsewhere, then overall y is discontinuous. But f is still continuous.

But in this case, even though f is non-constant (since it&#x27;s increasing and decreasing), but with a flat part, we can have a y that&#x27;s discontinuous on the flat part.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. For example, take f(x) = x on [a, c], f(x) = c on [c, d], and f(x) = d - x on [d, b], where a &lt; c &lt; d &lt; b. Then on [a, c], sup f(t) on [a,x] is f(x) =x, so y(x) =x. On [c, d], sup f(t) is f(c) = c, so y(x) can be any point in [a,x] that maps to c. Since c is in [a,x] for x ≥ c, we can choose y(x) = c for x in [c, d]. On [d, b], sup f(t) is still c, so y(x) must be c. Therefore, y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So overall, y(x) is x for x in [a,c), and c for x in [c, b]. This function y(x) is continuous on [a,c) and constant on [c,b], but at x=c, the left limit is c (since approaching from the left, y approaches c), and y(c)=c. So actually, y is continuous at c as well. Wait, no. Wait, for x approaching c from the left, y(x) approaches c, and y(c) = c. So y is continuous at c. Therefore, y is continuous everywhere. So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, so maybe even with a flat part, if we try to make y discontinuous, the requirement that sup f(t) = f(y(x)) forces y(x) to be c for x ≥ c. So y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So if we set y(x) = c for x ≥ c, that&#x27;s continuous. But if we tried to make y(x) jump around in the flat part, but since the sup is still c, y(x) has to be a point where f(y(x))=c. So if f is constant on [c, d], then any y(x) in [c, x] would work, but if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c, sometimes d, but since f is constant on [c,d], then f(y(x)) is still c. So y(x) could be discontinuous on [c, d]. For example, define y(x) = c for rational x in [c,d], and y(x) = d for irrational x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous on [c,d], but on [a,c), y(x)=x, which is continuous. So overall, y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence y is a discontinuous function. Therefore, this would work.

Wait, but when x is in [c,d], y(x) must lie in [a,x], but c ≤ x ≤ d, so if we choose y(x) = c or d, as long as c and d are ≤ x. Wait, but d is greater than c, and x is in [c,d]. So for x in [c,d], if we choose y(x) = d, then d must be ≤ x, but x ≤ d. So y(x)=d only works when x=d. So if x is in [c,d), then d is not ≤ x, so y(x) can&#x27;t be d. Therefore, in this case, if f is constant on [c,d], then for x in [c,d], y(x) must be a point in [a,x] where f(y(x))=c. Since f is c on [c,d], then y(x) can be any point in [c,x], since f(y(x))=c. So if we set y(x) = x for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s continuous. But if we choose y(x) to be c for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s also continuous. But if we set y(x) to sometimes be c and sometimes be other points in [c,x] in a discontinuous way.

For example, let’s define y(x) = c if x is rational, and y(x) = x if x is irrational, for x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous because in any neighborhood of a rational point, there are irrationals where y takes the value x, which approaches the rational point, so the limit would be the rational point, but y at the rational point is c, which is different unless c equals the rational point. Wait, c is a fixed point. Wait, if c is the left endpoint of the interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], if we define y(x) = c for x rational and y(x)=x for x irrational, then at any rational point x0 in [c,d], the function y(x) at x0 is c, but the limit as x approaches x0 from irrationals would be x0, which is not equal to c unless x0 = c. So at x=c, y is continuous because approaching from the right (if c &lt; d), y(x) approaches c (since irrationals approach c, but y(x)=x approaches c, and y(c)=c). But at any x0 &gt; c in [c,d], if x0 is rational, then y(x0)=c, but the limit from the irrationals is x0 ≠ c. So y is discontinuous at every rational point in (c,d]. Similarly, at irrational points x0, y is continuous because approaching from rationals, y approaches c, but y(x0)=x0. Unless c = x0, which only occurs at x0=c. Therefore, y is discontinuous at all rational points in (c,d]. Hence, y is discontinuous on a dense subset of [c,d], hence y is discontinuous everywhere on [c,d] except possibly at c.

Therefore, this y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence discontinuous overall. Therefore, even with a non-constant f (since f increases on [a,c] and is constant on [c,d], then decreases on [d,b]), we can construct a discontinuous y.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. So whether f is constant or not, we can have a discontinuous y. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But to make sure, let me think of another example. Suppose f is a sine wave on [0, 2π], continuous of course. The supremum on [0,x] would be 1 once x reaches π/2, since sin(π/2)=1, and then after that, the supremum remains 1. So for x ≥ π/2, y(x) must be π/2. For x &lt; π/2, y(x) must be x, since sin(x) is increasing on [0, π/2]. Therefore, y(x) is x for x ∈ [0, π/2] and π/2 for x ∈ [π/2, 2π]. This y is continuous, since at π/2, the left limit is π/2 and the right limit is π/2. So y is continuous here. But if we modify y(x) for x ≥ π/2 to sometimes be π/2 and sometimes other points where f is 1. Wait, but after π/2, the maximum is always 1, which is achieved at π/2 and also at 3π/2, but wait, sin(3π/2) is -1, which is not the supremum. Wait, no, on [0, x], for x ≥ π/2, the supremum is 1, achieved only at π/2. Because after π/2, sin decreases to 0 at π, then negative values, so the maximum remains 1. So y(x) must be π/2 for x ≥ π/2. Therefore, y(x) is forced to be π/2 there, hence continuous. So in this case, even with a non-constant f, y is continuous.

So in some cases, even if f is non-constant, y has to be continuous. But in other cases, like when f has a flat part, we can make y discontinuous. Therefore, the existence depends on the function f. But the problem asks whether there exists any continuous f and discontinuous y such that the equation holds. So as long as there is at least one such pair, the answer is yes. Since we have examples where f is constant or has flat parts allowing y to be discontinuous, the answer is yes.

Another angle: suppose f is such that its maximum on [a,x] is not uniquely attained. Then y(x) can choose any maximum point, and by choosing different points in a discontinuous way, y can be made discontinuous. However, for continuous f, the set of maximum points on [a,x] is a closed set, and if the maximum is not unique, it&#x27;s a closed interval. So for example, if f is constant on some interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], the maximum is attained on [c,x], which includes [c,x], so if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c and sometimes x in a discontinuous way, then y would be discontinuous.

But in order for the maximum not to be unique, f needs to be constant on some interval. If f is strictly increasing, then the maximum is unique (at x), so y(x) must be x. If f is non-strictly increasing, like with a flat part, then the maximum is not unique on that flat part.

Therefore, to have a discontinuous y, f must be non-strictly monotonic or have intervals where it&#x27;s constant. Therefore, such f exists, and for those f, we can construct discontinuous y. Hence, the answer is yes.

So, in summary, yes, such functions exist. For example, take f to be constant on [a,b], then any discontinuous y(x) ∈ [a,x] works. Or take f to have a flat part where y can be discontinuous, while keeping f continuous.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether there exists a continuous function \( f \) and a discontinuous function \( y \) such that the equation \(\sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) = f(y(x))\) holds for all \( x \in I = [a, b] \), we analyze the following key points:

1. **Supremum and Maximum**: For a continuous function \( f \) on a closed interval \([a, x]\), the supremum is attained as the maximum value. Therefore, there exists some \( y(x) \in [a, x] \) such that \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

2. **Constant Function Example**: If \( f \) is a constant function, then \( f(y(x)) \) will always equal the constant value for any \( y(x) \in [a, x] \). In this case, \( y(x) \) can be any function, including a discontinuous one. For example, \( y(x) \) could be defined as \( a \) for rational \( x \) and \( x \) for irrational \( x \), resulting in a discontinuous \( y \).

3. **Non-Constant Function Example**: For non-constant continuous functions \( f \) with intervals where \( f \) is constant or has flat parts, \( y(x) \) can be discontinuous on those intervals. For instance, if \( f \) is constant on a subinterval \([c, d]\), \( y(x) \) can jump between different points in \([a, x]\) while still satisfying \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

4. **Verification**: Even if \( f \) is non-constant, as long as there are intervals where the maximum is not uniquely attained (e.g., flat parts), \( y(x) \) can be chosen discontinuously. For example, defining \( y(x) \) to jump between endpoints of the flat part in a discontinuous manner.

Thus, there exist continuous functions \( f \) and discontinuous functions \( y \) that satisfy the given equation. Examples include constant functions with discontinuous \( y \) and non-constant functions with flat parts allowing discontinuous \( y \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if there&#x27;s a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y such that for every x in the interval [a,b], the supremum of f on [a,x] is equal to f(y(x)). Hmm, interesting. Let me break this down.

First, the supremum of f on [a,x] is just the maximum value of f on that interval since f is continuous on a closed interval, right? Because continuous functions on compact intervals attain their maximum and minimum. So, sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = max_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t). Therefore, there must be some point y(x) in [a,x] where f(y(x)) is equal to this maximum.

So y(x) is a function that picks out a point in [a,x] where f attains its maximum. The question is whether y can be discontinuous while f is continuous.

Let me think of some examples. Suppose f is a constant function. Then every point in [a,x] is a maximum, so y(x) could be any function from I to [a,x]. But since f is constant, even if y is discontinuous, f(y(x)) would still be constant, which matches the supremum. However, the problem states that y should be discontinuous. If f is constant, then y could be discontinuous, but maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that f has to be non-constant. So technically, yes, if f is constant, then y can be any function, including a discontinuous one. But maybe the problem is more interesting if f is non-constant. Let me check the problem statement again.

It says &quot;a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y&quot;. So it doesn&#x27;t specify that f must be non-constant, so maybe the answer is yes, and the example is a constant function f and any discontinuous y. But wait, if f is constant, then f(y(x)) is constant, which equals the supremum, which is also constant. So in that case, y can be any function, even a discontinuous one. So this would satisfy the equation. So in this case, such functions exist. But maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So as long as there exists any continuous f (could be constant) and some discontinuous y that works. Since in the case of constant f, y can be discontinuous, then the answer would be yes. But maybe the problem is intended to consider non-constant f? Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe even for non-constant f, can we have a discontinuous y? Let&#x27;s consider a non-constant f. Suppose f is increasing. Then the supremum on [a,x] is f(x), so y(x) must equal x. Then y is continuous, so that&#x27;s not helpful. If f is decreasing, then the supremum on [a,x] is f(a), so y(x) must be a for all x. But then y is constant, hence continuous. So in these cases, y is forced to be continuous.

What if f has a maximum somewhere in the middle? For example, suppose f is a function that increases up to some point c in [a,b] and then decreases. Then the supremum on [a,x] for x ≤ c would be f(x), and for x ≥ c, it would be f(c). So in that case, for x ≥ c, y(x) must be c. But for x &lt; c, y(x) must be x. So y(x) would be x for x &lt; c and c for x ≥ c. Is this function y discontinuous?

At x = c, left limit of y(x) as x approaches c from below is c, and the right limit is c, and y(c) = c, so it&#x27;s continuous at c. So y is continuous here. So even if f has a peak, y is still continuous.

Wait, but what if the maximum is not unique? For example, suppose f is constant on some interval. If f is constant on [a, d] for some d &gt; a, then any y(x) in [a, x] would work for x ≤ d. But if we choose y(x) to jump around, could that make y discontinuous? For example, suppose f is constant on [a, d], then for x in [a, d], y(x) could be a, then jump to some other point in [a, x], but since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the supremum. So in this case, y could be discontinuous on [a, d], but continuous elsewhere. However, the problem requires y to be discontinuous on the entire interval I = [a, b]. So if we only have y discontinuous on a subinterval, is that acceptable?

Wait, the problem states &quot;for all x ∈ I&quot;, so y needs to be defined on I, and the equation has to hold for all x in I. If f is constant on part of the interval, we can make y discontinuous there, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, y might have to be continuous there. So maybe we can construct an f that&#x27;s constant on some part and non-constant on another, allowing y to be discontinuous on the constant part but continuous on the non-constant part. But then y would not be entirely discontinuous on I. The problem requires y to be discontinuous, not necessarily discontinuous everywhere. So if y has at least one point of discontinuity, it&#x27;s considered discontinuous.

So if we have f constant on some subinterval, say [a, c], and non-constant on [c, b], then on [a, c], y can be discontinuous, and on [c, b], y has to be continuous. So overall y is discontinuous. For example, let f be constant on [a, c] and then increasing on [c, b]. Then on [a, c], y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so we can choose y(x) to jump around, like sometimes a, sometimes x, creating discontinuities. Then on [c, b], y(x) must be x. So overall, y would be discontinuous on [a, c] and continuous on [c, b]. But as long as there is at least one point of discontinuity, y is a discontinuous function. So such a function y exists.

But does this satisfy the equation? For x in [a, c], sup f(t) is the constant value, and y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so as long as f is constant on [a, c], f(y(x)) will equal the sup. For x in [c, b], sup f(t) is f(x) since f is increasing there, so y(x) must be x. So if we define y(x) to be, say, a for x in [a, c), and x for x in [c, b], then y is discontinuous at c (since left limit is a, right limit is c, and y(c) = c). So that&#x27;s a discontinuity at c. So this y is discontinuous, and f is continuous (constant on [a, c], increasing on [c, b]). Therefore, this would satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe even simpler: take f to be constant on the entire interval [a, b]. Then y can be any function from [a, b] to [a, b], as long as y(x) is in [a, x]. For example, define y(x) = a for all x except at some point, say x = c, where y(c) = c. Then y is discontinuous at c if we define it that way. Since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the constant value, which equals the sup. So in this case, y is discontinuous (has a jump at c) and f is continuous.

Therefore, such functions do exist. So the answer is yes.

Wait, but the problem says &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So if we can construct even one example where f is continuous and y is discontinuous (even if y is only discontinuous at one point), then the answer is yes. So in the case where f is constant, y can be discontinuous. So yes, such functions exist. So I think the answer is yes, and the example is f constant and y any discontinuous function picking points in [a,x]. But let me verify that.

Suppose f(x) = 1 for all x in [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = 1 for any x. Then we need f(y(x)) = 1, which is true for any y(x) ∈ [a,x] since f(y(x)) =1. So we can choose y(x) to be, for example, a if x is rational, and x if x is irrational. Then y is discontinuous everywhere except possibly at x=a, so y is discontinuous. Therefore, such a function y exists. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But maybe the problem is intended to have f non-constant? Let me check the original problem again. It just says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So even if f is constant, as long as y is discontinuous, that&#x27;s acceptable. Therefore, such a pair exists, so the answer is yes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trickier. Suppose f is not constant. Then can we still have a discontinuous y?

Suppose f is a non-constant continuous function. For example, f(x) = x on [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = f(x) = x. So y(x) must be x. Therefore, y is continuous. So in this case, y must be continuous.

But if f is a non-constant function that attains its maximum at varying points, maybe y can be discontinuous. Wait, but for continuous f, the maximum is attained, and the set of maximum points is a closed set. For example, suppose f is a function that has multiple maxima on some intervals. Wait, but if f is continuous, the set where f attains its maximum on [a,x] could be a single point or multiple points.

Wait, suppose f is such that on some subintervals, the maximum is attained at multiple points. For example, f is a constant on some subintervals. Wait, but even then, if we have to choose y(x) as one of those points, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, then on those parts y(x) has to be continuous.

Wait, maybe f could be a function that has plateaus. For example, f(x) is increasing up to some point, then constant, then decreasing. Then on the increasing part, y(x) =x, on the constant part, y(x) can be any point in [a,x], so we could choose to make y discontinuous there, and on the decreasing part, y(x) must be the point where the plateau is. So overall, y could have discontinuities in the constant part.

But if the problem allows y to be discontinuous only on parts where f is constant, but continuous elsewhere, then overall y is discontinuous. But f is still continuous.

But in this case, even though f is non-constant (since it&#x27;s increasing and decreasing), but with a flat part, we can have a y that&#x27;s discontinuous on the flat part.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. For example, take f(x) = x on [a, c], f(x) = c on [c, d], and f(x) = d - x on [d, b], where a &lt; c &lt; d &lt; b. Then on [a, c], sup f(t) on [a,x] is f(x) =x, so y(x) =x. On [c, d], sup f(t) is f(c) = c, so y(x) can be any point in [a,x] that maps to c. Since c is in [a,x] for x ≥ c, we can choose y(x) = c for x in [c, d]. On [d, b], sup f(t) is still c, so y(x) must be c. Therefore, y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So overall, y(x) is x for x in [a,c), and c for x in [c, b]. This function y(x) is continuous on [a,c) and constant on [c,b], but at x=c, the left limit is c (since approaching from the left, y approaches c), and y(c)=c. So actually, y is continuous at c as well. Wait, no. Wait, for x approaching c from the left, y(x) approaches c, and y(c) = c. So y is continuous at c. Therefore, y is continuous everywhere. So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, so maybe even with a flat part, if we try to make y discontinuous, the requirement that sup f(t) = f(y(x)) forces y(x) to be c for x ≥ c. So y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So if we set y(x) = c for x ≥ c, that&#x27;s continuous. But if we tried to make y(x) jump around in the flat part, but since the sup is still c, y(x) has to be a point where f(y(x))=c. So if f is constant on [c, d], then any y(x) in [c, x] would work, but if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c, sometimes d, but since f is constant on [c,d], then f(y(x)) is still c. So y(x) could be discontinuous on [c, d]. For example, define y(x) = c for rational x in [c,d], and y(x) = d for irrational x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous on [c,d], but on [a,c), y(x)=x, which is continuous. So overall, y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence y is a discontinuous function. Therefore, this would work.

Wait, but when x is in [c,d], y(x) must lie in [a,x], but c ≤ x ≤ d, so if we choose y(x) = c or d, as long as c and d are ≤ x. Wait, but d is greater than c, and x is in [c,d]. So for x in [c,d], if we choose y(x) = d, then d must be ≤ x, but x ≤ d. So y(x)=d only works when x=d. So if x is in [c,d), then d is not ≤ x, so y(x) can&#x27;t be d. Therefore, in this case, if f is constant on [c,d], then for x in [c,d], y(x) must be a point in [a,x] where f(y(x))=c. Since f is c on [c,d], then y(x) can be any point in [c,x], since f(y(x))=c. So if we set y(x) = x for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s continuous. But if we choose y(x) to be c for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s also continuous. But if we set y(x) to sometimes be c and sometimes be other points in [c,x] in a discontinuous way.

For example, let’s define y(x) = c if x is rational, and y(x) = x if x is irrational, for x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous because in any neighborhood of a rational point, there are irrationals where y takes the value x, which approaches the rational point, so the limit would be the rational point, but y at the rational point is c, which is different unless c equals the rational point. Wait, c is a fixed point. Wait, if c is the left endpoint of the interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], if we define y(x) = c for x rational and y(x)=x for x irrational, then at any rational point x0 in [c,d], the function y(x) at x0 is c, but the limit as x approaches x0 from irrationals would be x0, which is not equal to c unless x0 = c. So at x=c, y is continuous because approaching from the right (if c &lt; d), y(x) approaches c (since irrationals approach c, but y(x)=x approaches c, and y(c)=c). But at any x0 &gt; c in [c,d], if x0 is rational, then y(x0)=c, but the limit from the irrationals is x0 ≠ c. So y is discontinuous at every rational point in (c,d]. Similarly, at irrational points x0, y is continuous because approaching from rationals, y approaches c, but y(x0)=x0. Unless c = x0, which only occurs at x0=c. Therefore, y is discontinuous at all rational points in (c,d]. Hence, y is discontinuous on a dense subset of [c,d], hence y is discontinuous everywhere on [c,d] except possibly at c.

Therefore, this y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence discontinuous overall. Therefore, even with a non-constant f (since f increases on [a,c] and is constant on [c,d], then decreases on [d,b]), we can construct a discontinuous y.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. So whether f is constant or not, we can have a discontinuous y. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But to make sure, let me think of another example. Suppose f is a sine wave on [0, 2π], continuous of course. The supremum on [0,x] would be 1 once x reaches π/2, since sin(π/2)=1, and then after that, the supremum remains 1. So for x ≥ π/2, y(x) must be π/2. For x &lt; π/2, y(x) must be x, since sin(x) is increasing on [0, π/2]. Therefore, y(x) is x for x ∈ [0, π/2] and π/2 for x ∈ [π/2, 2π]. This y is continuous, since at π/2, the left limit is π/2 and the right limit is π/2. So y is continuous here. But if we modify y(x) for x ≥ π/2 to sometimes be π/2 and sometimes other points where f is 1. Wait, but after π/2, the maximum is always 1, which is achieved at π/2 and also at 3π/2, but wait, sin(3π/2) is -1, which is not the supremum. Wait, no, on [0, x], for x ≥ π/2, the supremum is 1, achieved only at π/2. Because after π/2, sin decreases to 0 at π, then negative values, so the maximum remains 1. So y(x) must be π/2 for x ≥ π/2. Therefore, y(x) is forced to be π/2 there, hence continuous. So in this case, even with a non-constant f, y is continuous.

So in some cases, even if f is non-constant, y has to be continuous. But in other cases, like when f has a flat part, we can make y discontinuous. Therefore, the existence depends on the function f. But the problem asks whether there exists any continuous f and discontinuous y such that the equation holds. So as long as there is at least one such pair, the answer is yes. Since we have examples where f is constant or has flat parts allowing y to be discontinuous, the answer is yes.

Another angle: suppose f is such that its maximum on [a,x] is not uniquely attained. Then y(x) can choose any maximum point, and by choosing different points in a discontinuous way, y can be made discontinuous. However, for continuous f, the set of maximum points on [a,x] is a closed set, and if the maximum is not unique, it&#x27;s a closed interval. So for example, if f is constant on some interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], the maximum is attained on [c,x], which includes [c,x], so if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c and sometimes x in a discontinuous way, then y would be discontinuous.

But in order for the maximum not to be unique, f needs to be constant on some interval. If f is strictly increasing, then the maximum is unique (at x), so y(x) must be x. If f is non-strictly increasing, like with a flat part, then the maximum is not unique on that flat part.

Therefore, to have a discontinuous y, f must be non-strictly monotonic or have intervals where it&#x27;s constant. Therefore, such f exists, and for those f, we can construct discontinuous y. Hence, the answer is yes.

So, in summary, yes, such functions exist. For example, take f to be constant on [a,b], then any discontinuous y(x) ∈ [a,x] works. Or take f to have a flat part where y can be discontinuous, while keeping f continuous.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether there exists a continuous function \( f \) and a discontinuous function \( y \) such that the equation \(\sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) = f(y(x))\) holds for all \( x \in I = [a, b] \), we analyze the following key points:

1. **Supremum and Maximum**: For a continuous function \( f \) on a closed interval \([a, x]\), the supremum is attained as the maximum value. Therefore, there exists some \( y(x) \in [a, x] \) such that \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

2. **Constant Function Example**: If \( f \) is a constant function, then \( f(y(x)) \) will always equal the constant value for any \( y(x) \in [a, x] \). In this case, \( y(x) \) can be any function, including a discontinuous one. For example, \( y(x) \) could be defined as \( a \) for rational \( x \) and \( x \) for irrational \( x \), resulting in a discontinuous \( y \).

3. **Non-Constant Function Example**: For non-constant continuous functions \( f \) with intervals where \( f \) is constant or has flat parts, \( y(x) \) can be discontinuous on those intervals. For instance, if \( f \) is constant on a subinterval \([c, d]\), \( y(x) \) can jump between different points in \([a, x]\) while still satisfying \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

4. **Verification**: Even if \( f \) is non-constant, as long as there are intervals where the maximum is not uniquely attained (e.g., flat parts), \( y(x) \) can be chosen discontinuously. For example, defining \( y(x) \) to jump between endpoints of the flat part in a discontinuous manner.

Thus, there exist continuous functions \( f \) and discontinuous functions \( y \) that satisfy the given equation. Examples include constant functions with discontinuous \( y \) and non-constant functions with flat parts allowing discontinuous \( y \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if there&#x27;s a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y such that for every x in the interval [a,b], the supremum of f on [a,x] is equal to f(y(x)). Hmm, interesting. Let me break this down.

First, the supremum of f on [a,x] is just the maximum value of f on that interval since f is continuous on a closed interval, right? Because continuous functions on compact intervals attain their maximum and minimum. So, sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = max_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t). Therefore, there must be some point y(x) in [a,x] where f(y(x)) is equal to this maximum.

So y(x) is a function that picks out a point in [a,x] where f attains its maximum. The question is whether y can be discontinuous while f is continuous.

Let me think of some examples. Suppose f is a constant function. Then every point in [a,x] is a maximum, so y(x) could be any function from I to [a,x]. But since f is constant, even if y is discontinuous, f(y(x)) would still be constant, which matches the supremum. However, the problem states that y should be discontinuous. If f is constant, then y could be discontinuous, but maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that f has to be non-constant. So technically, yes, if f is constant, then y can be any function, including a discontinuous one. But maybe the problem is more interesting if f is non-constant. Let me check the problem statement again.

It says &quot;a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y&quot;. So it doesn&#x27;t specify that f must be non-constant, so maybe the answer is yes, and the example is a constant function f and any discontinuous y. But wait, if f is constant, then f(y(x)) is constant, which equals the supremum, which is also constant. So in that case, y can be any function, even a discontinuous one. So this would satisfy the equation. So in this case, such functions exist. But maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So as long as there exists any continuous f (could be constant) and some discontinuous y that works. Since in the case of constant f, y can be discontinuous, then the answer would be yes. But maybe the problem is intended to consider non-constant f? Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe even for non-constant f, can we have a discontinuous y? Let&#x27;s consider a non-constant f. Suppose f is increasing. Then the supremum on [a,x] is f(x), so y(x) must equal x. Then y is continuous, so that&#x27;s not helpful. If f is decreasing, then the supremum on [a,x] is f(a), so y(x) must be a for all x. But then y is constant, hence continuous. So in these cases, y is forced to be continuous.

What if f has a maximum somewhere in the middle? For example, suppose f is a function that increases up to some point c in [a,b] and then decreases. Then the supremum on [a,x] for x ≤ c would be f(x), and for x ≥ c, it would be f(c). So in that case, for x ≥ c, y(x) must be c. But for x &lt; c, y(x) must be x. So y(x) would be x for x &lt; c and c for x ≥ c. Is this function y discontinuous?

At x = c, left limit of y(x) as x approaches c from below is c, and the right limit is c, and y(c) = c, so it&#x27;s continuous at c. So y is continuous here. So even if f has a peak, y is still continuous.

Wait, but what if the maximum is not unique? For example, suppose f is constant on some interval. If f is constant on [a, d] for some d &gt; a, then any y(x) in [a, x] would work for x ≤ d. But if we choose y(x) to jump around, could that make y discontinuous? For example, suppose f is constant on [a, d], then for x in [a, d], y(x) could be a, then jump to some other point in [a, x], but since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the supremum. So in this case, y could be discontinuous on [a, d], but continuous elsewhere. However, the problem requires y to be discontinuous on the entire interval I = [a, b]. So if we only have y discontinuous on a subinterval, is that acceptable?

Wait, the problem states &quot;for all x ∈ I&quot;, so y needs to be defined on I, and the equation has to hold for all x in I. If f is constant on part of the interval, we can make y discontinuous there, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, y might have to be continuous there. So maybe we can construct an f that&#x27;s constant on some part and non-constant on another, allowing y to be discontinuous on the constant part but continuous on the non-constant part. But then y would not be entirely discontinuous on I. The problem requires y to be discontinuous, not necessarily discontinuous everywhere. So if y has at least one point of discontinuity, it&#x27;s considered discontinuous.

So if we have f constant on some subinterval, say [a, c], and non-constant on [c, b], then on [a, c], y can be discontinuous, and on [c, b], y has to be continuous. So overall y is discontinuous. For example, let f be constant on [a, c] and then increasing on [c, b]. Then on [a, c], y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so we can choose y(x) to jump around, like sometimes a, sometimes x, creating discontinuities. Then on [c, b], y(x) must be x. So overall, y would be discontinuous on [a, c] and continuous on [c, b]. But as long as there is at least one point of discontinuity, y is a discontinuous function. So such a function y exists.

But does this satisfy the equation? For x in [a, c], sup f(t) is the constant value, and y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so as long as f is constant on [a, c], f(y(x)) will equal the sup. For x in [c, b], sup f(t) is f(x) since f is increasing there, so y(x) must be x. So if we define y(x) to be, say, a for x in [a, c), and x for x in [c, b], then y is discontinuous at c (since left limit is a, right limit is c, and y(c) = c). So that&#x27;s a discontinuity at c. So this y is discontinuous, and f is continuous (constant on [a, c], increasing on [c, b]). Therefore, this would satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe even simpler: take f to be constant on the entire interval [a, b]. Then y can be any function from [a, b] to [a, b], as long as y(x) is in [a, x]. For example, define y(x) = a for all x except at some point, say x = c, where y(c) = c. Then y is discontinuous at c if we define it that way. Since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the constant value, which equals the sup. So in this case, y is discontinuous (has a jump at c) and f is continuous.

Therefore, such functions do exist. So the answer is yes.

Wait, but the problem says &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So if we can construct even one example where f is continuous and y is discontinuous (even if y is only discontinuous at one point), then the answer is yes. So in the case where f is constant, y can be discontinuous. So yes, such functions exist. So I think the answer is yes, and the example is f constant and y any discontinuous function picking points in [a,x]. But let me verify that.

Suppose f(x) = 1 for all x in [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = 1 for any x. Then we need f(y(x)) = 1, which is true for any y(x) ∈ [a,x] since f(y(x)) =1. So we can choose y(x) to be, for example, a if x is rational, and x if x is irrational. Then y is discontinuous everywhere except possibly at x=a, so y is discontinuous. Therefore, such a function y exists. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But maybe the problem is intended to have f non-constant? Let me check the original problem again. It just says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So even if f is constant, as long as y is discontinuous, that&#x27;s acceptable. Therefore, such a pair exists, so the answer is yes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trickier. Suppose f is not constant. Then can we still have a discontinuous y?

Suppose f is a non-constant continuous function. For example, f(x) = x on [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = f(x) = x. So y(x) must be x. Therefore, y is continuous. So in this case, y must be continuous.

But if f is a non-constant function that attains its maximum at varying points, maybe y can be discontinuous. Wait, but for continuous f, the maximum is attained, and the set of maximum points is a closed set. For example, suppose f is a function that has multiple maxima on some intervals. Wait, but if f is continuous, the set where f attains its maximum on [a,x] could be a single point or multiple points.

Wait, suppose f is such that on some subintervals, the maximum is attained at multiple points. For example, f is a constant on some subintervals. Wait, but even then, if we have to choose y(x) as one of those points, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, then on those parts y(x) has to be continuous.

Wait, maybe f could be a function that has plateaus. For example, f(x) is increasing up to some point, then constant, then decreasing. Then on the increasing part, y(x) =x, on the constant part, y(x) can be any point in [a,x], so we could choose to make y discontinuous there, and on the decreasing part, y(x) must be the point where the plateau is. So overall, y could have discontinuities in the constant part.

But if the problem allows y to be discontinuous only on parts where f is constant, but continuous elsewhere, then overall y is discontinuous. But f is still continuous.

But in this case, even though f is non-constant (since it&#x27;s increasing and decreasing), but with a flat part, we can have a y that&#x27;s discontinuous on the flat part.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. For example, take f(x) = x on [a, c], f(x) = c on [c, d], and f(x) = d - x on [d, b], where a &lt; c &lt; d &lt; b. Then on [a, c], sup f(t) on [a,x] is f(x) =x, so y(x) =x. On [c, d], sup f(t) is f(c) = c, so y(x) can be any point in [a,x] that maps to c. Since c is in [a,x] for x ≥ c, we can choose y(x) = c for x in [c, d]. On [d, b], sup f(t) is still c, so y(x) must be c. Therefore, y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So overall, y(x) is x for x in [a,c), and c for x in [c, b]. This function y(x) is continuous on [a,c) and constant on [c,b], but at x=c, the left limit is c (since approaching from the left, y approaches c), and y(c)=c. So actually, y is continuous at c as well. Wait, no. Wait, for x approaching c from the left, y(x) approaches c, and y(c) = c. So y is continuous at c. Therefore, y is continuous everywhere. So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, so maybe even with a flat part, if we try to make y discontinuous, the requirement that sup f(t) = f(y(x)) forces y(x) to be c for x ≥ c. So y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So if we set y(x) = c for x ≥ c, that&#x27;s continuous. But if we tried to make y(x) jump around in the flat part, but since the sup is still c, y(x) has to be a point where f(y(x))=c. So if f is constant on [c, d], then any y(x) in [c, x] would work, but if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c, sometimes d, but since f is constant on [c,d], then f(y(x)) is still c. So y(x) could be discontinuous on [c, d]. For example, define y(x) = c for rational x in [c,d], and y(x) = d for irrational x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous on [c,d], but on [a,c), y(x)=x, which is continuous. So overall, y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence y is a discontinuous function. Therefore, this would work.

Wait, but when x is in [c,d], y(x) must lie in [a,x], but c ≤ x ≤ d, so if we choose y(x) = c or d, as long as c and d are ≤ x. Wait, but d is greater than c, and x is in [c,d]. So for x in [c,d], if we choose y(x) = d, then d must be ≤ x, but x ≤ d. So y(x)=d only works when x=d. So if x is in [c,d), then d is not ≤ x, so y(x) can&#x27;t be d. Therefore, in this case, if f is constant on [c,d], then for x in [c,d], y(x) must be a point in [a,x] where f(y(x))=c. Since f is c on [c,d], then y(x) can be any point in [c,x], since f(y(x))=c. So if we set y(x) = x for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s continuous. But if we choose y(x) to be c for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s also continuous. But if we set y(x) to sometimes be c and sometimes be other points in [c,x] in a discontinuous way.

For example, let’s define y(x) = c if x is rational, and y(x) = x if x is irrational, for x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous because in any neighborhood of a rational point, there are irrationals where y takes the value x, which approaches the rational point, so the limit would be the rational point, but y at the rational point is c, which is different unless c equals the rational point. Wait, c is a fixed point. Wait, if c is the left endpoint of the interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], if we define y(x) = c for x rational and y(x)=x for x irrational, then at any rational point x0 in [c,d], the function y(x) at x0 is c, but the limit as x approaches x0 from irrationals would be x0, which is not equal to c unless x0 = c. So at x=c, y is continuous because approaching from the right (if c &lt; d), y(x) approaches c (since irrationals approach c, but y(x)=x approaches c, and y(c)=c). But at any x0 &gt; c in [c,d], if x0 is rational, then y(x0)=c, but the limit from the irrationals is x0 ≠ c. So y is discontinuous at every rational point in (c,d]. Similarly, at irrational points x0, y is continuous because approaching from rationals, y approaches c, but y(x0)=x0. Unless c = x0, which only occurs at x0=c. Therefore, y is discontinuous at all rational points in (c,d]. Hence, y is discontinuous on a dense subset of [c,d], hence y is discontinuous everywhere on [c,d] except possibly at c.

Therefore, this y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence discontinuous overall. Therefore, even with a non-constant f (since f increases on [a,c] and is constant on [c,d], then decreases on [d,b]), we can construct a discontinuous y.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. So whether f is constant or not, we can have a discontinuous y. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But to make sure, let me think of another example. Suppose f is a sine wave on [0, 2π], continuous of course. The supremum on [0,x] would be 1 once x reaches π/2, since sin(π/2)=1, and then after that, the supremum remains 1. So for x ≥ π/2, y(x) must be π/2. For x &lt; π/2, y(x) must be x, since sin(x) is increasing on [0, π/2]. Therefore, y(x) is x for x ∈ [0, π/2] and π/2 for x ∈ [π/2, 2π]. This y is continuous, since at π/2, the left limit is π/2 and the right limit is π/2. So y is continuous here. But if we modify y(x) for x ≥ π/2 to sometimes be π/2 and sometimes other points where f is 1. Wait, but after π/2, the maximum is always 1, which is achieved at π/2 and also at 3π/2, but wait, sin(3π/2) is -1, which is not the supremum. Wait, no, on [0, x], for x ≥ π/2, the supremum is 1, achieved only at π/2. Because after π/2, sin decreases to 0 at π, then negative values, so the maximum remains 1. So y(x) must be π/2 for x ≥ π/2. Therefore, y(x) is forced to be π/2 there, hence continuous. So in this case, even with a non-constant f, y is continuous.

So in some cases, even if f is non-constant, y has to be continuous. But in other cases, like when f has a flat part, we can make y discontinuous. Therefore, the existence depends on the function f. But the problem asks whether there exists any continuous f and discontinuous y such that the equation holds. So as long as there is at least one such pair, the answer is yes. Since we have examples where f is constant or has flat parts allowing y to be discontinuous, the answer is yes.

Another angle: suppose f is such that its maximum on [a,x] is not uniquely attained. Then y(x) can choose any maximum point, and by choosing different points in a discontinuous way, y can be made discontinuous. However, for continuous f, the set of maximum points on [a,x] is a closed set, and if the maximum is not unique, it&#x27;s a closed interval. So for example, if f is constant on some interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], the maximum is attained on [c,x], which includes [c,x], so if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c and sometimes x in a discontinuous way, then y would be discontinuous.

But in order for the maximum not to be unique, f needs to be constant on some interval. If f is strictly increasing, then the maximum is unique (at x), so y(x) must be x. If f is non-strictly increasing, like with a flat part, then the maximum is not unique on that flat part.

Therefore, to have a discontinuous y, f must be non-strictly monotonic or have intervals where it&#x27;s constant. Therefore, such f exists, and for those f, we can construct discontinuous y. Hence, the answer is yes.

So, in summary, yes, such functions exist. For example, take f to be constant on [a,b], then any discontinuous y(x) ∈ [a,x] works. Or take f to have a flat part where y can be discontinuous, while keeping f continuous.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether there exists a continuous function \( f \) and a discontinuous function \( y \) such that the equation \(\sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) = f(y(x))\) holds for all \( x \in I = [a, b] \), we analyze the following key points:

1. **Supremum and Maximum**: For a continuous function \( f \) on a closed interval \([a, x]\), the supremum is attained as the maximum value. Therefore, there exists some \( y(x) \in [a, x] \) such that \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

2. **Constant Function Example**: If \( f \) is a constant function, then \( f(y(x)) \) will always equal the constant value for any \( y(x) \in [a, x] \). In this case, \( y(x) \) can be any function, including a discontinuous one. For example, \( y(x) \) could be defined as \( a \) for rational \( x \) and \( x \) for irrational \( x \), resulting in a discontinuous \( y \).

3. **Non-Constant Function Example**: For non-constant continuous functions \( f \) with intervals where \( f \) is constant or has flat parts, \( y(x) \) can be discontinuous on those intervals. For instance, if \( f \) is constant on a subinterval \([c, d]\), \( y(x) \) can jump between different points in \([a, x]\) while still satisfying \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

4. **Verification**: Even if \( f \) is non-constant, as long as there are intervals where the maximum is not uniquely attained (e.g., flat parts), \( y(x) \) can be chosen discontinuously. For example, defining \( y(x) \) to jump between endpoints of the flat part in a discontinuous manner.

Thus, there exist continuous functions \( f \) and discontinuous functions \( y \) that satisfy the given equation. Examples include constant functions with discontinuous \( y \) and non-constant functions with flat parts allowing discontinuous \( y \).

Then on [a, c], y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so we can choose y(x) to jump around, like sometimes a, sometimes x, creating discontinuities. Then on [c, b], y(x) must be x. So overall, y would be discontinuous on [a, c] and continuous on [c, b]. But as long as there is at least one point of discontinuity, y is a discontinuous function. So such a function y exists.

But does this satisfy the equation? For x in [a, c], sup f(t) is the constant value, and y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so as long as f is constant on [a, c], f(y(x)) will equal the sup. For x in [c, b], sup f(t) is f(x) since f is increasing there, so y(x) must be x. So if we define y(x) to be, say, a for x in [a, c), and x for x in [c, b], then y is discontinuous at c (since left limit is a, right limit is c, and y(c) = c). So that&#x27;s a discontinuity at c. So this y is discontinuous, and f is continuous (constant on [a, c], increasing on [c, b]). Therefore, this would satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe even simpler: take f to be constant on the entire interval [a, b]. Then y can be any function from [a, b] to [a, b], as long as y(x) is in [a, x]. For example, define y(x) = a for all x except at some point, say x = c, where y(c) = c. Then y is discontinuous at c if we define it that way. Since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the constant value, which equals the sup. So in this case, y is discontinuous (has a jump at c) and f is continuous.

Therefore, such functions do exist. So the answer is yes.

Wait, but the problem says &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So if we can construct even one example where f is continuous and y is discontinuous (even if y is only discontinuous at one point), then the answer is yes. So in the case where f is constant, y can be discontinuous. So yes, such functions exist. So I think the answer is yes, and the example is f constant and y any discontinuous function picking points in [a,x]. But let me verify that.

Suppose f(x) = 1 for all x in [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = 1 for any x. Then we need f(y(x)) = 1, which is true for any y(x) ∈ [a,x] since f(y(x)) =1. So we can choose y(x) to be, for example, a if x is rational, and x if x is irrational. Then y is discontinuous everywhere except possibly at x=a, so y is discontinuous. Therefore, such a function y exists. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But maybe the problem is intended to have f non-constant? Let me check the original problem again. It just says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So even if f is constant, as long as y is discontinuous, that&#x27;s acceptable. Therefore, such a pair exists, so the answer is yes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trickier. Suppose f is not constant. Then can we still have a discontinuous y?

Suppose f is a non-constant continuous function. For example, f(x) = x on [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = f(x) = x. So y(x) must be x. Therefore, y is continuous. So in this case, y must be continuous.

But if f is a non-constant function that attains its maximum at varying points, maybe y can be discontinuous. Wait, but for continuous f, the maximum is attained, and the set of maximum points is a closed set. For example, suppose f is a function that has multiple maxima on some intervals. Wait, but if f is continuous, the set where f attains its maximum on [a,x] could be a single point or multiple points.

Wait, suppose f is such that on some subintervals, the maximum is attained at multiple points. For example, f is a constant on some subintervals. Wait, but even then, if we have to choose y(x) as one of those points, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, then on those parts y(x) has to be continuous.

Wait, maybe f could be a function that has plateaus. For example, f(x) is increasing up to some point, then constant, then decreasing. Then on the increasing part, y(x) =x, on the constant part, y(x) can be any point in [a,x], so we could choose to make y discontinuous there, and on the decreasing part, y(x) must be the point where the plateau is. So overall, y could have discontinuities in the constant part.

But if the problem allows y to be discontinuous only on parts where f is constant, but continuous elsewhere, then overall y is discontinuous. But f is still continuous.

But in this case, even though f is non-constant (since it&#x27;s increasing and decreasing), but with a flat part, we can have a y that&#x27;s discontinuous on the flat part.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. For example, take f(x) = x on [a, c], f(x) = c on [c, d], and f(x) = d - x on [d, b], where a &lt; c &lt; d &lt; b. Then on [a, c], sup f(t) on [a,x] is f(x) =x, so y(x) =x. On [c, d], sup f(t) is f(c) = c, so y(x) can be any point in [a,x] that maps to c. Since c is in [a,x] for x ≥ c, we can choose y(x) = c for x in [c, d]. On [d, b], sup f(t) is still c, so y(x) must be c. Therefore, y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So overall, y(x) is x for x in [a,c), and c for x in [c, b]. This function y(x) is continuous on [a,c) and constant on [c,b], but at x=c, the left limit is c (since approaching from the left, y approaches c), and y(c)=c. So actually, y is continuous at c as well. Wait, no. Wait, for x approaching c from the left, y(x) approaches c, and y(c) = c. So y is continuous at c. Therefore, y is continuous everywhere. So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, so maybe even with a flat part, if we try to make y discontinuous, the requirement that sup f(t) = f(y(x)) forces y(x) to be c for x ≥ c. So y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So if we set y(x) = c for x ≥ c, that&#x27;s continuous. But if we tried to make y(x) jump around in the flat part, but since the sup is still c, y(x) has to be a point where f(y(x))=c. So if f is constant on [c, d], then any y(x) in [c, x] would work, but if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c, sometimes d, but since f is constant on [c,d], then f(y(x)) is still c. So y(x) could be discontinuous on [c, d]. For example, define y(x) = c for rational x in [c,d], and y(x) = d for irrational x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous on [c,d], but on [a,c), y(x)=x, which is continuous. So overall, y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence y is a discontinuous function. Therefore, this would work.

Wait, but when x is in [c,d], y(x) must lie in [a,x], but c ≤ x ≤ d, so if we choose y(x) = c or d, as long as c and d are ≤ x. Wait, but d is greater than c, and x is in [c,d]. So for x in [c,d], if we choose y(x) = d, then d must be ≤ x, but x ≤ d. So y(x)=d only works when x=d. So if x is in [c,d), then d is not ≤ x, so y(x) can&#x27;t be d. Therefore, in this case, if f is constant on [c,d], then for x in [c,d], y(x) must be a point in [a,x] where f(y(x))=c. Since f is c on [c,d], then y(x) can be any point in [c,x], since f(y(x))=c. So if we set y(x) = x for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s continuous. But if we choose y(x) to be c for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s also continuous. But if we set y(x) to sometimes be c and sometimes be other points in [c,x] in a discontinuous way.

For example, let’s define y(x) = c if x is rational, and y(x) = x if x is irrational, for x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous because in any neighborhood of a rational point, there are irrationals where y takes the value x, which approaches the rational point, so the limit would be the rational point, but y at the rational point is c, which is different unless c equals the rational point. Wait, c is a fixed point. Wait, if c is the left endpoint of the interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], if we define y(x) = c for x rational and y(x)=x for x irrational, then at any rational point x0 in [c,d], the function y(x) at x0 is c, but the limit as x approaches x0 from irrationals would be x0, which is not equal to c unless x0 = c. So at x=c, y is continuous because approaching from the right (if c &lt; d), y(x) approaches c (since irrationals approach c, but y(x)=x approaches c, and y(c)=c). But at any x0 &gt; c in [c,d], if x0 is rational, then y(x0)=c, but the limit from the irrationals is x0 ≠ c. So y is discontinuous at every rational point in (c,d]. Similarly, at irrational points x0, y is continuous because approaching from rationals, y approaches c, but y(x0)=x0. Unless c = x0, which only occurs at x0=c. Therefore, y is discontinuous at all rational points in (c,d]. Hence, y is discontinuous on a dense subset of [c,d], hence y is discontinuous everywhere on [c,d] except possibly at c.

Therefore, this y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence discontinuous overall. Therefore, even with a non-constant f (since f increases on [a,c] and is constant on [c,d], then decreases on [d,b]), we can construct a discontinuous y.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. So whether f is constant or not, we can have a discontinuous y. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But to make sure, let me think of another example. Suppose f is a sine wave on [0, 2π], continuous of course. The supremum on [0,x] would be 1 once x reaches π/2, since sin(π/2)=1, and then after that, the supremum remains 1. So for x ≥ π/2, y(x) must be π/2. For x &lt; π/2, y(x) must be x, since sin(x) is increasing on [0, π/2]. Therefore, y(x) is x for x ∈ [0, π/2] and π/2 for x ∈ [π/2, 2π]. This y is continuous, since at π/2, the left limit is π/2 and the right limit is π/2. So y is continuous here. But if we modify y(x) for x ≥ π/2 to sometimes be π/2 and sometimes other points where f is 1. Wait, but after π/2, the maximum is always 1, which is achieved at π/2 and also at 3π/2, but wait, sin(3π/2) is -1, which is not the supremum. Wait, no, on [0, x], for x ≥ π/2, the supremum is 1, achieved only at π/2. Because after π/2, sin decreases to 0 at π, then negative values, so the maximum remains 1. So y(x) must be π/2 for x ≥ π/2. Therefore, y(x) is forced to be π/2 there, hence continuous. So in this case, even with a non-constant f, y is continuous.

So in some cases, even if f is non-constant, y has to be continuous. But in other cases, like when f has a flat part, we can make y discontinuous. Therefore, the existence depends on the function f. But the problem asks whether there exists any continuous f and discontinuous y such that the equation holds. So as long as there is at least one such pair, the answer is yes. Since we have examples where f is constant or has flat parts allowing y to be discontinuous, the answer is yes.

Another angle: suppose f is such that its maximum on [a,x] is not uniquely attained. Then y(x) can choose any maximum point, and by choosing different points in a discontinuous way, y can be made discontinuous. However, for continuous f, the set of maximum points on [a,x] is a closed set, and if the maximum is not unique, it&#x27;s a closed interval. So for example, if f is constant on some interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], the maximum is attained on [c,x], which includes [c,x], so if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c and sometimes x in a discontinuous way, then y would be discontinuous.

But in order for the maximum not to be unique, f needs to be constant on some interval. If f is strictly increasing, then the maximum is unique (at x), so y(x) must be x. If f is non-strictly increasing, like with a flat part, then the maximum is not unique on that flat part.

Therefore, to have a discontinuous y, f must be non-strictly monotonic or have intervals where it&#x27;s constant. Therefore, such f exists, and for those f, we can construct discontinuous y. Hence, the answer is yes.

So, in summary, yes, such functions exist. For example, take f to be constant on [a,b], then any discontinuous y(x) ∈ [a,x] works. Or take f to have a flat part where y can be discontinuous, while keeping f continuous.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether there exists a continuous function \( f \) and a discontinuous function \( y \) such that the equation \(\sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) = f(y(x))\) holds for all \( x \in I = [a, b] \), we analyze the following key points:

1. **Supremum and Maximum**: For a continuous function \( f \) on a closed interval \([a, x]\), the supremum is attained as the maximum value. Therefore, there exists some \( y(x) \in [a, x] \) such that \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

2. **Constant Function Example**: If \( f \) is a constant function, then \( f(y(x)) \) will always equal the constant value for any \( y(x) \in [a, x] \). In this case, \( y(x) \) can be any function, including a discontinuous one. For example, \( y(x) \) could be defined as \( a \) for rational \( x \) and \( x \) for irrational \( x \), resulting in a discontinuous \( y \).

3. **Non-Constant Function Example**: For non-constant continuous functions \( f \) with intervals where \( f \) is constant or has flat parts, \( y(x) \) can be discontinuous on those intervals. For instance, if \( f \) is constant on a subinterval \([c, d]\), \( y(x) \) can jump between different points in \([a, x]\) while still satisfying \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

4. **Verification**: Even if \( f \) is non-constant, as long as there are intervals where the maximum is not uniquely attained (e.g., flat parts), \( y(x) \) can be chosen discontinuously. For example, defining \( y(x) \) to jump between endpoints of the flat part in a discontinuous manner.

Thus, there exist continuous functions \( f \) and discontinuous functions \( y \) that satisfy the given equation. Examples include constant functions with discontinuous \( y \) and non-constant functions with flat parts allowing discontinuous \( y \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if there&#x27;s a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y such that for every x in the interval [a,b], the supremum of f on [a,x] is equal to f(y(x)). Hmm, interesting. Let me break this down.

First, the supremum of f on [a,x] is just the maximum value of f on that interval since f is continuous on a closed interval, right? Because continuous functions on compact intervals attain their maximum and minimum. So, sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = max_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t). Therefore, there must be some point y(x) in [a,x] where f(y(x)) is equal to this maximum.

So y(x) is a function that picks out a point in [a,x] where f attains its maximum. The question is whether y can be discontinuous while f is continuous.

Let me think of some examples. Suppose f is a constant function. Then every point in [a,x] is a maximum, so y(x) could be any function from I to [a,x]. But since f is constant, even if y is discontinuous, f(y(x)) would still be constant, which matches the supremum. However, the problem states that y should be discontinuous. If f is constant, then y could be discontinuous, but maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that f has to be non-constant. So technically, yes, if f is constant, then y can be any function, including a discontinuous one. But maybe the problem is more interesting if f is non-constant. Let me check the problem statement again.

It says &quot;a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y&quot;. So it doesn&#x27;t specify that f must be non-constant, so maybe the answer is yes, and the example is a constant function f and any discontinuous y. But wait, if f is constant, then f(y(x)) is constant, which equals the supremum, which is also constant. So in that case, y can be any function, even a discontinuous one. So this would satisfy the equation. So in this case, such functions exist. But maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So as long as there exists any continuous f (could be constant) and some discontinuous y that works. Since in the case of constant f, y can be discontinuous, then the answer would be yes. But maybe the problem is intended to consider non-constant f? Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe even for non-constant f, can we have a discontinuous y? Let&#x27;s consider a non-constant f. Suppose f is increasing. Then the supremum on [a,x] is f(x), so y(x) must equal x. Then y is continuous, so that&#x27;s not helpful. If f is decreasing, then the supremum on [a,x] is f(a), so y(x) must be a for all x. But then y is constant, hence continuous. So in these cases, y is forced to be continuous.

What if f has a maximum somewhere in the middle? For example, suppose f is a function that increases up to some point c in [a,b] and then decreases. Then the supremum on [a,x] for x ≤ c would be f(x), and for x ≥ c, it would be f(c). So in that case, for x ≥ c, y(x) must be c. But for x &lt; c, y(x) must be x. So y(x) would be x for x &lt; c and c for x ≥ c. Is this function y discontinuous?

At x = c, left limit of y(x) as x approaches c from below is c, and the right limit is c, and y(c) = c, so it&#x27;s continuous at c. So y is continuous here. So even if f has a peak, y is still continuous.

Wait, but what if the maximum is not unique? For example, suppose f is constant on some interval. If f is constant on [a, d] for some d &gt; a, then any y(x) in [a, x] would work for x ≤ d. But if we choose y(x) to jump around, could that make y discontinuous? For example, suppose f is constant on [a, d], then for x in [a, d], y(x) could be a, then jump to some other point in [a, x], but since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the supremum. So in this case, y could be discontinuous on [a, d], but continuous elsewhere. However, the problem requires y to be discontinuous on the entire interval I = [a, b]. So if we only have y discontinuous on a subinterval, is that acceptable?

Wait, the problem states &quot;for all x ∈ I&quot;, so y needs to be defined on I, and the equation has to hold for all x in I. If f is constant on part of the interval, we can make y discontinuous there, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, y might have to be continuous there. So maybe we can construct an f that&#x27;s constant on some part and non-constant on another, allowing y to be discontinuous on the constant part but continuous on the non-constant part. But then y would not be entirely discontinuous on I. The problem requires y to be discontinuous, not necessarily discontinuous everywhere. So if y has at least one point of discontinuity, it&#x27;s considered discontinuous.

So if we have f constant on some subinterval, say [a, c], and non-constant on [c, b], then on [a, c], y can be discontinuous, and on [c, b], y has to be continuous. So overall y is discontinuous. For example, let f be constant on [a, c] and then increasing on [c, b]. Then on [a, c], y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so we can choose y(x) to jump around, like sometimes a, sometimes x, creating discontinuities. Then on [c, b], y(x) must be x. So overall, y would be discontinuous on [a, c] and continuous on [c, b]. But as long as there is at least one point of discontinuity, y is a discontinuous function. So such a function y exists.

But does this satisfy the equation? For x in [a, c], sup f(t) is the constant value, and y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so as long as f is constant on [a, c], f(y(x)) will equal the sup. For x in [c, b], sup f(t) is f(x) since f is increasing there, so y(x) must be x. So if we define y(x) to be, say, a for x in [a, c), and x for x in [c, b], then y is discontinuous at c (since left limit is a, right limit is c, and y(c) = c). So that&#x27;s a discontinuity at c. So this y is discontinuous, and f is continuous (constant on [a, c], increasing on [c, b]). Therefore, this would satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe even simpler: take f to be constant on the entire interval [a, b]. Then y can be any function from [a, b] to [a, b], as long as y(x) is in [a, x]. For example, define y(x) = a for all x except at some point, say x = c, where y(c) = c. Then y is discontinuous at c if we define it that way. Since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the constant value, which equals the sup. So in this case, y is discontinuous (has a jump at c) and f is continuous.

Therefore, such functions do exist. So the answer is yes.

Wait, but the problem says &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So if we can construct even one example where f is continuous and y is discontinuous (even if y is only discontinuous at one point), then the answer is yes. So in the case where f is constant, y can be discontinuous. So yes, such functions exist. So I think the answer is yes, and the example is f constant and y any discontinuous function picking points in [a,x]. But let me verify that.

Suppose f(x) = 1 for all x in [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = 1 for any x. Then we need f(y(x)) = 1, which is true for any y(x) ∈ [a,x] since f(y(x)) =1. So we can choose y(x) to be, for example, a if x is rational, and x if x is irrational. Then y is discontinuous everywhere except possibly at x=a, so y is discontinuous. Therefore, such a function y exists. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But maybe the problem is intended to have f non-constant? Let me check the original problem again. It just says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So even if f is constant, as long as y is discontinuous, that&#x27;s acceptable. Therefore, such a pair exists, so the answer is yes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trickier. Suppose f is not constant. Then can we still have a discontinuous y?

Suppose f is a non-constant continuous function. For example, f(x) = x on [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = f(x) = x. So y(x) must be x. Therefore, y is continuous. So in this case, y must be continuous.

But if f is a non-constant function that attains its maximum at varying points, maybe y can be discontinuous. Wait, but for continuous f, the maximum is attained, and the set of maximum points is a closed set. For example, suppose f is a function that has multiple maxima on some intervals. Wait, but if f is continuous, the set where f attains its maximum on [a,x] could be a single point or multiple points.

Wait, suppose f is such that on some subintervals, the maximum is attained at multiple points. For example, f is a constant on some subintervals. Wait, but even then, if we have to choose y(x) as one of those points, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, then on those parts y(x) has to be continuous.

Wait, maybe f could be a function that has plateaus. For example, f(x) is increasing up to some point, then constant, then decreasing. Then on the increasing part, y(x) =x, on the constant part, y(x) can be any point in [a,x], so we could choose to make y discontinuous there, and on the decreasing part, y(x) must be the point where the plateau is. So overall, y could have discontinuities in the constant part.

But if the problem allows y to be discontinuous only on parts where f is constant, but continuous elsewhere, then overall y is discontinuous. But f is still continuous.

But in this case, even though f is non-constant (since it&#x27;s increasing and decreasing), but with a flat part, we can have a y that&#x27;s discontinuous on the flat part.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. For example, take f(x) = x on [a, c], f(x) = c on [c, d], and f(x) = d - x on [d, b], where a &lt; c &lt; d &lt; b. Then on [a, c], sup f(t) on [a,x] is f(x) =x, so y(x) =x. On [c, d], sup f(t) is f(c) = c, so y(x) can be any point in [a,x] that maps to c. Since c is in [a,x] for x ≥ c, we can choose y(x) = c for x in [c, d]. On [d, b], sup f(t) is still c, so y(x) must be c. Therefore, y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So overall, y(x) is x for x in [a,c), and c for x in [c, b]. This function y(x) is continuous on [a,c) and constant on [c,b], but at x=c, the left limit is c (since approaching from the left, y approaches c), and y(c)=c. So actually, y is continuous at c as well. Wait, no. Wait, for x approaching c from the left, y(x) approaches c, and y(c) = c. So y is continuous at c. Therefore, y is continuous everywhere. So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, so maybe even with a flat part, if we try to make y discontinuous, the requirement that sup f(t) = f(y(x)) forces y(x) to be c for x ≥ c. So y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So if we set y(x) = c for x ≥ c, that&#x27;s continuous. But if we tried to make y(x) jump around in the flat part, but since the sup is still c, y(x) has to be a point where f(y(x))=c. So if f is constant on [c, d], then any y(x) in [c, x] would work, but if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c, sometimes d, but since f is constant on [c,d], then f(y(x)) is still c. So y(x) could be discontinuous on [c, d]. For example, define y(x) = c for rational x in [c,d], and y(x) = d for irrational x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous on [c,d], but on [a,c), y(x)=x, which is continuous. So overall, y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence y is a discontinuous function. Therefore, this would work.

Wait, but when x is in [c,d], y(x) must lie in [a,x], but c ≤ x ≤ d, so if we choose y(x) = c or d, as long as c and d are ≤ x. Wait, but d is greater than c, and x is in [c,d]. So for x in [c,d], if we choose y(x) = d, then d must be ≤ x, but x ≤ d. So y(x)=d only works when x=d. So if x is in [c,d), then d is not ≤ x, so y(x) can&#x27;t be d. Therefore, in this case, if f is constant on [c,d], then for x in [c,d], y(x) must be a point in [a,x] where f(y(x))=c. Since f is c on [c,d], then y(x) can be any point in [c,x], since f(y(x))=c. So if we set y(x) = x for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s continuous. But if we choose y(x) to be c for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s also continuous. But if we set y(x) to sometimes be c and sometimes be other points in [c,x] in a discontinuous way.

For example, let’s define y(x) = c if x is rational, and y(x) = x if x is irrational, for x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous because in any neighborhood of a rational point, there are irrationals where y takes the value x, which approaches the rational point, so the limit would be the rational point, but y at the rational point is c, which is different unless c equals the rational point. Wait, c is a fixed point. Wait, if c is the left endpoint of the interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], if we define y(x) = c for x rational and y(x)=x for x irrational, then at any rational point x0 in [c,d], the function y(x) at x0 is c, but the limit as x approaches x0 from irrationals would be x0, which is not equal to c unless x0 = c. So at x=c, y is continuous because approaching from the right (if c &lt; d), y(x) approaches c (since irrationals approach c, but y(x)=x approaches c, and y(c)=c). But at any x0 &gt; c in [c,d], if x0 is rational, then y(x0)=c, but the limit from the irrationals is x0 ≠ c. So y is discontinuous at every rational point in (c,d]. Similarly, at irrational points x0, y is continuous because approaching from rationals, y approaches c, but y(x0)=x0. Unless c = x0, which only occurs at x0=c. Therefore, y is discontinuous at all rational points in (c,d]. Hence, y is discontinuous on a dense subset of [c,d], hence y is discontinuous everywhere on [c,d] except possibly at c.

Therefore, this y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence discontinuous overall. Therefore, even with a non-constant f (since f increases on [a,c] and is constant on [c,d], then decreases on [d,b]), we can construct a discontinuous y.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. So whether f is constant or not, we can have a discontinuous y. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But to make sure, let me think of another example. Suppose f is a sine wave on [0, 2π], continuous of course. The supremum on [0,x] would be 1 once x reaches π/2, since sin(π/2)=1, and then after that, the supremum remains 1. So for x ≥ π/2, y(x) must be π/2. For x &lt; π/2, y(x) must be x, since sin(x) is increasing on [0, π/2]. Therefore, y(x) is x for x ∈ [0, π/2] and π/2 for x ∈ [π/2, 2π]. This y is continuous, since at π/2, the left limit is π/2 and the right limit is π/2. So y is continuous here. But if we modify y(x) for x ≥ π/2 to sometimes be π/2 and sometimes other points where f is 1. Wait, but after π/2, the maximum is always 1, which is achieved at π/2 and also at 3π/2, but wait, sin(3π/2) is -1, which is not the supremum. Wait, no, on [0, x], for x ≥ π/2, the supremum is 1, achieved only at π/2. Because after π/2, sin decreases to 0 at π, then negative values, so the maximum remains 1. So y(x) must be π/2 for x ≥ π/2. Therefore, y(x) is forced to be π/2 there, hence continuous. So in this case, even with a non-constant f, y is continuous.

So in some cases, even if f is non-constant, y has to be continuous. But in other cases, like when f has a flat part, we can make y discontinuous. Therefore, the existence depends on the function f. But the problem asks whether there exists any continuous f and discontinuous y such that the equation holds. So as long as there is at least one such pair, the answer is yes. Since we have examples where f is constant or has flat parts allowing y to be discontinuous, the answer is yes.

Another angle: suppose f is such that its maximum on [a,x] is not uniquely attained. Then y(x) can choose any maximum point, and by choosing different points in a discontinuous way, y can be made discontinuous. However, for continuous f, the set of maximum points on [a,x] is a closed set, and if the maximum is not unique, it&#x27;s a closed interval. So for example, if f is constant on some interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], the maximum is attained on [c,x], which includes [c,x], so if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c and sometimes x in a discontinuous way, then y would be discontinuous.

But in order for the maximum not to be unique, f needs to be constant on some interval. If f is strictly increasing, then the maximum is unique (at x), so y(x) must be x. If f is non-strictly increasing, like with a flat part, then the maximum is not unique on that flat part.

Therefore, to have a discontinuous y, f must be non-strictly monotonic or have intervals where it&#x27;s constant. Therefore, such f exists, and for those f, we can construct discontinuous y. Hence, the answer is yes.

So, in summary, yes, such functions exist. For example, take f to be constant on [a,b], then any discontinuous y(x) ∈ [a,x] works. Or take f to have a flat part where y can be discontinuous, while keeping f continuous.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether there exists a continuous function \( f \) and a discontinuous function \( y \) such that the equation \(\sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) = f(y(x))\) holds for all \( x \in I = [a, b] \), we analyze the following key points:

1. **Supremum and Maximum**: For a continuous function \( f \) on a closed interval \([a, x]\), the supremum is attained as the maximum value. Therefore, there exists some \( y(x) \in [a, x] \) such that \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

2. **Constant Function Example**: If \( f \) is a constant function, then \( f(y(x)) \) will always equal the constant value for any \( y(x) \in [a, x] \). In this case, \( y(x) \) can be any function, including a discontinuous one. For example, \( y(x) \) could be defined as \( a \) for rational \( x \) and \( x \) for irrational \( x \), resulting in a discontinuous \( y \).

3. **Non-Constant Function Example**: For non-constant continuous functions \( f \) with intervals where \( f \) is constant or has flat parts, \( y(x) \) can be discontinuous on those intervals. For instance, if \( f \) is constant on a subinterval \([c, d]\), \( y(x) \) can jump between different points in \([a, x]\) while still satisfying \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

4. **Verification**: Even if \( f \) is non-constant, as long as there are intervals where the maximum is not uniquely attained (e.g., flat parts), \( y(x) \) can be chosen discontinuously. For example, defining \( y(x) \) to jump between endpoints of the flat part in a discontinuous manner.

Thus, there exist continuous functions \( f \) and discontinuous functions \( y \) that satisfy the given equation. Examples include constant functions with discontinuous \( y \) and non-constant functions with flat parts allowing discontinuous \( y \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if there&#x27;s a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y such that for every x in the interval [a,b], the supremum of f on [a,x] is equal to f(y(x)). Hmm, interesting. Let me break this down.

First, the supremum of f on [a,x] is just the maximum value of f on that interval since f is continuous on a closed interval, right? Because continuous functions on compact intervals attain their maximum and minimum. So, sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = max_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t). Therefore, there must be some point y(x) in [a,x] where f(y(x)) is equal to this maximum.

So y(x) is a function that picks out a point in [a,x] where f attains its maximum. The question is whether y can be discontinuous while f is continuous.

Let me think of some examples. Suppose f is a constant function. Then every point in [a,x] is a maximum, so y(x) could be any function from I to [a,x]. But since f is constant, even if y is discontinuous, f(y(x)) would still be constant, which matches the supremum. However, the problem states that y should be discontinuous. If f is constant, then y could be discontinuous, but maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that f has to be non-constant. So technically, yes, if f is constant, then y can be any function, including a discontinuous one. But maybe the problem is more interesting if f is non-constant. Let me check the problem statement again.

It says &quot;a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y&quot;. So it doesn&#x27;t specify that f must be non-constant, so maybe the answer is yes, and the example is a constant function f and any discontinuous y. But wait, if f is constant, then f(y(x)) is constant, which equals the supremum, which is also constant. So in that case, y can be any function, even a discontinuous one. So this would satisfy the equation. So in this case, such functions exist. But maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So as long as there exists any continuous f (could be constant) and some discontinuous y that works. Since in the case of constant f, y can be discontinuous, then the answer would be yes. But maybe the problem is intended to consider non-constant f? Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe even for non-constant f, can we have a discontinuous y? Let&#x27;s consider a non-constant f. Suppose f is increasing. Then the supremum on [a,x] is f(x), so y(x) must equal x. Then y is continuous, so that&#x27;s not helpful. If f is decreasing, then the supremum on [a,x] is f(a), so y(x) must be a for all x. But then y is constant, hence continuous. So in these cases, y is forced to be continuous.

What if f has a maximum somewhere in the middle? For example, suppose f is a function that increases up to some point c in [a,b] and then decreases. Then the supremum on [a,x] for x ≤ c would be f(x), and for x ≥ c, it would be f(c). So in that case, for x ≥ c, y(x) must be c. But for x &lt; c, y(x) must be x. So y(x) would be x for x &lt; c and c for x ≥ c. Is this function y discontinuous?

At x = c, left limit of y(x) as x approaches c from below is c, and the right limit is c, and y(c) = c, so it&#x27;s continuous at c. So y is continuous here. So even if f has a peak, y is still continuous.

Wait, but what if the maximum is not unique? For example, suppose f is constant on some interval. If f is constant on [a, d] for some d &gt; a, then any y(x) in [a, x] would work for x ≤ d. But if we choose y(x) to jump around, could that make y discontinuous? For example, suppose f is constant on [a, d], then for x in [a, d], y(x) could be a, then jump to some other point in [a, x], but since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the supremum. So in this case, y could be discontinuous on [a, d], but continuous elsewhere. However, the problem requires y to be discontinuous on the entire interval I = [a, b]. So if we only have y discontinuous on a subinterval, is that acceptable?

Wait, the problem states &quot;for all x ∈ I&quot;, so y needs to be defined on I, and the equation has to hold for all x in I. If f is constant on part of the interval, we can make y discontinuous there, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, y might have to be continuous there. So maybe we can construct an f that&#x27;s constant on some part and non-constant on another, allowing y to be discontinuous on the constant part but continuous on the non-constant part. But then y would not be entirely discontinuous on I. The problem requires y to be discontinuous, not necessarily discontinuous everywhere. So if y has at least one point of discontinuity, it&#x27;s considered discontinuous.

So if we have f constant on some subinterval, say [a, c], and non-constant on [c, b], then on [a, c], y can be discontinuous, and on [c, b], y has to be continuous. So overall y is discontinuous. For example, let f be constant on [a, c] and then increasing on [c, b]. Then on [a, c], y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so we can choose y(x) to jump around, like sometimes a, sometimes x, creating discontinuities. Then on [c, b], y(x) must be x. So overall, y would be discontinuous on [a, c] and continuous on [c, b]. But as long as there is at least one point of discontinuity, y is a discontinuous function. So such a function y exists.

But does this satisfy the equation? For x in [a, c], sup f(t) is the constant value, and y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so as long as f is constant on [a, c], f(y(x)) will equal the sup. For x in [c, b], sup f(t) is f(x) since f is increasing there, so y(x) must be x. So if we define y(x) to be, say, a for x in [a, c), and x for x in [c, b], then y is discontinuous at c (since left limit is a, right limit is c, and y(c) = c). So that&#x27;s a discontinuity at c. So this y is discontinuous, and f is continuous (constant on [a, c], increasing on [c, b]). Therefore, this would satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe even simpler: take f to be constant on the entire interval [a, b]. Then y can be any function from [a, b] to [a, b], as long as y(x) is in [a, x]. For example, define y(x) = a for all x except at some point, say x = c, where y(c) = c. Then y is discontinuous at c if we define it that way. Since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the constant value, which equals the sup. So in this case, y is discontinuous (has a jump at c) and f is continuous.

Therefore, such functions do exist. So the answer is yes.

Wait, but the problem says &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So if we can construct even one example where f is continuous and y is discontinuous (even if y is only discontinuous at one point), then the answer is yes. So in the case where f is constant, y can be discontinuous. So yes, such functions exist. So I think the answer is yes, and the example is f constant and y any discontinuous function picking points in [a,x]. But let me verify that.

Suppose f(x) = 1 for all x in [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = 1 for any x. Then we need f(y(x)) = 1, which is true for any y(x) ∈ [a,x] since f(y(x)) =1. So we can choose y(x) to be, for example, a if x is rational, and x if x is irrational. Then y is discontinuous everywhere except possibly at x=a, so y is discontinuous. Therefore, such a function y exists. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But maybe the problem is intended to have f non-constant? Let me check the original problem again. It just says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So even if f is constant, as long as y is discontinuous, that&#x27;s acceptable. Therefore, such a pair exists, so the answer is yes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trickier. Suppose f is not constant. Then can we still have a discontinuous y?

Suppose f is a non-constant continuous function. For example, f(x) = x on [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = f(x) = x. So y(x) must be x. Therefore, y is continuous. So in this case, y must be continuous.

But if f is a non-constant function that attains its maximum at varying points, maybe y can be discontinuous. Wait, but for continuous f, the maximum is attained, and the set of maximum points is a closed set. For example, suppose f is a function that has multiple maxima on some intervals. Wait, but if f is continuous, the set where f attains its maximum on [a,x] could be a single point or multiple points.

Wait, suppose f is such that on some subintervals, the maximum is attained at multiple points. For example, f is a constant on some subintervals. Wait, but even then, if we have to choose y(x) as one of those points, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, then on those parts y(x) has to be continuous.

Wait, maybe f could be a function that has plateaus. For example, f(x) is increasing up to some point, then constant, then decreasing. Then on the increasing part, y(x) =x, on the constant part, y(x) can be any point in [a,x], so we could choose to make y discontinuous there, and on the decreasing part, y(x) must be the point where the plateau is. So overall, y could have discontinuities in the constant part.

But if the problem allows y to be discontinuous only on parts where f is constant, but continuous elsewhere, then overall y is discontinuous. But f is still continuous.

But in this case, even though f is non-constant (since it&#x27;s increasing and decreasing), but with a flat part, we can have a y that&#x27;s discontinuous on the flat part.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. For example, take f(x) = x on [a, c], f(x) = c on [c, d], and f(x) = d - x on [d, b], where a &lt; c &lt; d &lt; b. Then on [a, c], sup f(t) on [a,x] is f(x) =x, so y(x) =x. On [c, d], sup f(t) is f(c) = c, so y(x) can be any point in [a,x] that maps to c. Since c is in [a,x] for x ≥ c, we can choose y(x) = c for x in [c, d]. On [d, b], sup f(t) is still c, so y(x) must be c. Therefore, y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So overall, y(x) is x for x in [a,c), and c for x in [c, b]. This function y(x) is continuous on [a,c) and constant on [c,b], but at x=c, the left limit is c (since approaching from the left, y approaches c), and y(c)=c. So actually, y is continuous at c as well. Wait, no. Wait, for x approaching c from the left, y(x) approaches c, and y(c) = c. So y is continuous at c. Therefore, y is continuous everywhere. So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, so maybe even with a flat part, if we try to make y discontinuous, the requirement that sup f(t) = f(y(x)) forces y(x) to be c for x ≥ c. So y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So if we set y(x) = c for x ≥ c, that&#x27;s continuous. But if we tried to make y(x) jump around in the flat part, but since the sup is still c, y(x) has to be a point where f(y(x))=c. So if f is constant on [c, d], then any y(x) in [c, x] would work, but if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c, sometimes d, but since f is constant on [c,d], then f(y(x)) is still c. So y(x) could be discontinuous on [c, d]. For example, define y(x) = c for rational x in [c,d], and y(x) = d for irrational x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous on [c,d], but on [a,c), y(x)=x, which is continuous. So overall, y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence y is a discontinuous function. Therefore, this would work.

Wait, but when x is in [c,d], y(x) must lie in [a,x], but c ≤ x ≤ d, so if we choose y(x) = c or d, as long as c and d are ≤ x. Wait, but d is greater than c, and x is in [c,d]. So for x in [c,d], if we choose y(x) = d, then d must be ≤ x, but x ≤ d. So y(x)=d only works when x=d. So if x is in [c,d), then d is not ≤ x, so y(x) can&#x27;t be d. Therefore, in this case, if f is constant on [c,d], then for x in [c,d], y(x) must be a point in [a,x] where f(y(x))=c. Since f is c on [c,d], then y(x) can be any point in [c,x], since f(y(x))=c. So if we set y(x) = x for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s continuous. But if we choose y(x) to be c for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s also continuous. But if we set y(x) to sometimes be c and sometimes be other points in [c,x] in a discontinuous way.

For example, let’s define y(x) = c if x is rational, and y(x) = x if x is irrational, for x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous because in any neighborhood of a rational point, there are irrationals where y takes the value x, which approaches the rational point, so the limit would be the rational point, but y at the rational point is c, which is different unless c equals the rational point. Wait, c is a fixed point. Wait, if c is the left endpoint of the interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], if we define y(x) = c for x rational and y(x)=x for x irrational, then at any rational point x0 in [c,d], the function y(x) at x0 is c, but the limit as x approaches x0 from irrationals would be x0, which is not equal to c unless x0 = c. So at x=c, y is continuous because approaching from the right (if c &lt; d), y(x) approaches c (since irrationals approach c, but y(x)=x approaches c, and y(c)=c). But at any x0 &gt; c in [c,d], if x0 is rational, then y(x0)=c, but the limit from the irrationals is x0 ≠ c. So y is discontinuous at every rational point in (c,d]. Similarly, at irrational points x0, y is continuous because approaching from rationals, y approaches c, but y(x0)=x0. Unless c = x0, which only occurs at x0=c. Therefore, y is discontinuous at all rational points in (c,d]. Hence, y is discontinuous on a dense subset of [c,d], hence y is discontinuous everywhere on [c,d] except possibly at c.

Therefore, this y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence discontinuous overall. Therefore, even with a non-constant f (since f increases on [a,c] and is constant on [c,d], then decreases on [d,b]), we can construct a discontinuous y.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. So whether f is constant or not, we can have a discontinuous y. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But to make sure, let me think of another example. Suppose f is a sine wave on [0, 2π], continuous of course. The supremum on [0,x] would be 1 once x reaches π/2, since sin(π/2)=1, and then after that, the supremum remains 1. So for x ≥ π/2, y(x) must be π/2. For x &lt; π/2, y(x) must be x, since sin(x) is increasing on [0, π/2]. Therefore, y(x) is x for x ∈ [0, π/2] and π/2 for x ∈ [π/2, 2π]. This y is continuous, since at π/2, the left limit is π/2 and the right limit is π/2. So y is continuous here. But if we modify y(x) for x ≥ π/2 to sometimes be π/2 and sometimes other points where f is 1. Wait, but after π/2, the maximum is always 1, which is achieved at π/2 and also at 3π/2, but wait, sin(3π/2) is -1, which is not the supremum. Wait, no, on [0, x], for x ≥ π/2, the supremum is 1, achieved only at π/2. Because after π/2, sin decreases to 0 at π, then negative values, so the maximum remains 1. So y(x) must be π/2 for x ≥ π/2. Therefore, y(x) is forced to be π/2 there, hence continuous. So in this case, even with a non-constant f, y is continuous.

So in some cases, even if f is non-constant, y has to be continuous. But in other cases, like when f has a flat part, we can make y discontinuous. Therefore, the existence depends on the function f. But the problem asks whether there exists any continuous f and discontinuous y such that the equation holds. So as long as there is at least one such pair, the answer is yes. Since we have examples where f is constant or has flat parts allowing y to be discontinuous, the answer is yes.

Another angle: suppose f is such that its maximum on [a,x] is not uniquely attained. Then y(x) can choose any maximum point, and by choosing different points in a discontinuous way, y can be made discontinuous. However, for continuous f, the set of maximum points on [a,x] is a closed set, and if the maximum is not unique, it&#x27;s a closed interval. So for example, if f is constant on some interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], the maximum is attained on [c,x], which includes [c,x], so if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c and sometimes x in a discontinuous way, then y would be discontinuous.

But in order for the maximum not to be unique, f needs to be constant on some interval. If f is strictly increasing, then the maximum is unique (at x), so y(x) must be x. If f is non-strictly increasing, like with a flat part, then the maximum is not unique on that flat part.

Therefore, to have a discontinuous y, f must be non-strictly monotonic or have intervals where it&#x27;s constant. Therefore, such f exists, and for those f, we can construct discontinuous y. Hence, the answer is yes.

So, in summary, yes, such functions exist. For example, take f to be constant on [a,b], then any discontinuous y(x) ∈ [a,x] works. Or take f to have a flat part where y can be discontinuous, while keeping f continuous.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether there exists a continuous function \( f \) and a discontinuous function \( y \) such that the equation \(\sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) = f(y(x))\) holds for all \( x \in I = [a, b] \), we analyze the following key points:

1. **Supremum and Maximum**: For a continuous function \( f \) on a closed interval \([a, x]\), the supremum is attained as the maximum value. Therefore, there exists some \( y(x) \in [a, x] \) such that \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

2. **Constant Function Example**: If \( f \) is a constant function, then \( f(y(x)) \) will always equal the constant value for any \( y(x) \in [a, x] \). In this case, \( y(x) \) can be any function, including a discontinuous one. For example, \( y(x) \) could be defined as \( a \) for rational \( x \) and \( x \) for irrational \( x \), resulting in a discontinuous \( y \).

3. **Non-Constant Function Example**: For non-constant continuous functions \( f \) with intervals where \( f \) is constant or has flat parts, \( y(x) \) can be discontinuous on those intervals. For instance, if \( f \) is constant on a subinterval \([c, d]\), \( y(x) \) can jump between different points in \([a, x]\) while still satisfying \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

4. **Verification**: Even if \( f \) is non-constant, as long as there are intervals where the maximum is not uniquely attained (e.g., flat parts), \( y(x) \) can be chosen discontinuously. For example, defining \( y(x) \) to jump between endpoints of the flat part in a discontinuous manner.

Thus, there exist continuous functions \( f \) and discontinuous functions \( y \) that satisfy the given equation. Examples include constant functions with discontinuous \( y \) and non-constant functions with flat parts allowing discontinuous \( y \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if there&#x27;s a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y such that for every x in the interval [a,b], the supremum of f on [a,x] is equal to f(y(x)). Hmm, interesting. Let me break this down.

First, the supremum of f on [a,x] is just the maximum value of f on that interval since f is continuous on a closed interval, right? Because continuous functions on compact intervals attain their maximum and minimum. So, sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = max_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t). Therefore, there must be some point y(x) in [a,x] where f(y(x)) is equal to this maximum.

So y(x) is a function that picks out a point in [a,x] where f attains its maximum. The question is whether y can be discontinuous while f is continuous.

Let me think of some examples. Suppose f is a constant function. Then every point in [a,x] is a maximum, so y(x) could be any function from I to [a,x]. But since f is constant, even if y is discontinuous, f(y(x)) would still be constant, which matches the supremum. However, the problem states that y should be discontinuous. If f is constant, then y could be discontinuous, but maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that f has to be non-constant. So technically, yes, if f is constant, then y can be any function, including a discontinuous one. But maybe the problem is more interesting if f is non-constant. Let me check the problem statement again.

It says &quot;a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y&quot;. So it doesn&#x27;t specify that f must be non-constant, so maybe the answer is yes, and the example is a constant function f and any discontinuous y. But wait, if f is constant, then f(y(x)) is constant, which equals the supremum, which is also constant. So in that case, y can be any function, even a discontinuous one. So this would satisfy the equation. So in this case, such functions exist. But maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So as long as there exists any continuous f (could be constant) and some discontinuous y that works. Since in the case of constant f, y can be discontinuous, then the answer would be yes. But maybe the problem is intended to consider non-constant f? Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe even for non-constant f, can we have a discontinuous y? Let&#x27;s consider a non-constant f. Suppose f is increasing. Then the supremum on [a,x] is f(x), so y(x) must equal x. Then y is continuous, so that&#x27;s not helpful. If f is decreasing, then the supremum on [a,x] is f(a), so y(x) must be a for all x. But then y is constant, hence continuous. So in these cases, y is forced to be continuous.

What if f has a maximum somewhere in the middle? For example, suppose f is a function that increases up to some point c in [a,b] and then decreases. Then the supremum on [a,x] for x ≤ c would be f(x), and for x ≥ c, it would be f(c). So in that case, for x ≥ c, y(x) must be c. But for x &lt; c, y(x) must be x. So y(x) would be x for x &lt; c and c for x ≥ c. Is this function y discontinuous?

At x = c, left limit of y(x) as x approaches c from below is c, and the right limit is c, and y(c) = c, so it&#x27;s continuous at c. So y is continuous here. So even if f has a peak, y is still continuous.

Wait, but what if the maximum is not unique? For example, suppose f is constant on some interval. If f is constant on [a, d] for some d &gt; a, then any y(x) in [a, x] would work for x ≤ d. But if we choose y(x) to jump around, could that make y discontinuous? For example, suppose f is constant on [a, d], then for x in [a, d], y(x) could be a, then jump to some other point in [a, x], but since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the supremum. So in this case, y could be discontinuous on [a, d], but continuous elsewhere. However, the problem requires y to be discontinuous on the entire interval I = [a, b]. So if we only have y discontinuous on a subinterval, is that acceptable?

Wait, the problem states &quot;for all x ∈ I&quot;, so y needs to be defined on I, and the equation has to hold for all x in I. If f is constant on part of the interval, we can make y discontinuous there, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, y might have to be continuous there. So maybe we can construct an f that&#x27;s constant on some part and non-constant on another, allowing y to be discontinuous on the constant part but continuous on the non-constant part. But then y would not be entirely discontinuous on I. The problem requires y to be discontinuous, not necessarily discontinuous everywhere. So if y has at least one point of discontinuity, it&#x27;s considered discontinuous.

So if we have f constant on some subinterval, say [a, c], and non-constant on [c, b], then on [a, c], y can be discontinuous, and on [c, b], y has to be continuous. So overall y is discontinuous. For example, let f be constant on [a, c] and then increasing on [c, b]. Then on [a, c], y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so we can choose y(x) to jump around, like sometimes a, sometimes x, creating discontinuities. Then on [c, b], y(x) must be x. So overall, y would be discontinuous on [a, c] and continuous on [c, b]. But as long as there is at least one point of discontinuity, y is a discontinuous function. So such a function y exists.

But does this satisfy the equation? For x in [a, c], sup f(t) is the constant value, and y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so as long as f is constant on [a, c], f(y(x)) will equal the sup. For x in [c, b], sup f(t) is f(x) since f is increasing there, so y(x) must be x. So if we define y(x) to be, say, a for x in [a, c), and x for x in [c, b], then y is discontinuous at c (since left limit is a, right limit is c, and y(c) = c). So that&#x27;s a discontinuity at c. So this y is discontinuous, and f is continuous (constant on [a, c], increasing on [c, b]). Therefore, this would satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe even simpler: take f to be constant on the entire interval [a, b]. Then y can be any function from [a, b] to [a, b], as long as y(x) is in [a, x]. For example, define y(x) = a for all x except at some point, say x = c, where y(c) = c. Then y is discontinuous at c if we define it that way. Since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the constant value, which equals the sup. So in this case, y is discontinuous (has a jump at c) and f is continuous.

Therefore, such functions do exist. So the answer is yes.

Wait, but the problem says &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So if we can construct even one example where f is continuous and y is discontinuous (even if y is only discontinuous at one point), then the answer is yes. So in the case where f is constant, y can be discontinuous. So yes, such functions exist. So I think the answer is yes, and the example is f constant and y any discontinuous function picking points in [a,x]. But let me verify that.

Suppose f(x) = 1 for all x in [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = 1 for any x. Then we need f(y(x)) = 1, which is true for any y(x) ∈ [a,x] since f(y(x)) =1. So we can choose y(x) to be, for example, a if x is rational, and x if x is irrational. Then y is discontinuous everywhere except possibly at x=a, so y is discontinuous. Therefore, such a function y exists. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But maybe the problem is intended to have f non-constant? Let me check the original problem again. It just says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So even if f is constant, as long as y is discontinuous, that&#x27;s acceptable. Therefore, such a pair exists, so the answer is yes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trickier. Suppose f is not constant. Then can we still have a discontinuous y?

Suppose f is a non-constant continuous function. For example, f(x) = x on [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = f(x) = x. So y(x) must be x. Therefore, y is continuous. So in this case, y must be continuous.

But if f is a non-constant function that attains its maximum at varying points, maybe y can be discontinuous. Wait, but for continuous f, the maximum is attained, and the set of maximum points is a closed set. For example, suppose f is a function that has multiple maxima on some intervals. Wait, but if f is continuous, the set where f attains its maximum on [a,x] could be a single point or multiple points.

Wait, suppose f is such that on some subintervals, the maximum is attained at multiple points. For example, f is a constant on some subintervals. Wait, but even then, if we have to choose y(x) as one of those points, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, then on those parts y(x) has to be continuous.

Wait, maybe f could be a function that has plateaus. For example, f(x) is increasing up to some point, then constant, then decreasing. Then on the increasing part, y(x) =x, on the constant part, y(x) can be any point in [a,x], so we could choose to make y discontinuous there, and on the decreasing part, y(x) must be the point where the plateau is. So overall, y could have discontinuities in the constant part.

But if the problem allows y to be discontinuous only on parts where f is constant, but continuous elsewhere, then overall y is discontinuous. But f is still continuous.

But in this case, even though f is non-constant (since it&#x27;s increasing and decreasing), but with a flat part, we can have a y that&#x27;s discontinuous on the flat part.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. For example, take f(x) = x on [a, c], f(x) = c on [c, d], and f(x) = d - x on [d, b], where a &lt; c &lt; d &lt; b. Then on [a, c], sup f(t) on [a,x] is f(x) =x, so y(x) =x. On [c, d], sup f(t) is f(c) = c, so y(x) can be any point in [a,x] that maps to c. Since c is in [a,x] for x ≥ c, we can choose y(x) = c for x in [c, d]. On [d, b], sup f(t) is still c, so y(x) must be c. Therefore, y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So overall, y(x) is x for x in [a,c), and c for x in [c, b]. This function y(x) is continuous on [a,c) and constant on [c,b], but at x=c, the left limit is c (since approaching from the left, y approaches c), and y(c)=c. So actually, y is continuous at c as well. Wait, no. Wait, for x approaching c from the left, y(x) approaches c, and y(c) = c. So y is continuous at c. Therefore, y is continuous everywhere. So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, so maybe even with a flat part, if we try to make y discontinuous, the requirement that sup f(t) = f(y(x)) forces y(x) to be c for x ≥ c. So y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So if we set y(x) = c for x ≥ c, that&#x27;s continuous. But if we tried to make y(x) jump around in the flat part, but since the sup is still c, y(x) has to be a point where f(y(x))=c. So if f is constant on [c, d], then any y(x) in [c, x] would work, but if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c, sometimes d, but since f is constant on [c,d], then f(y(x)) is still c. So y(x) could be discontinuous on [c, d]. For example, define y(x) = c for rational x in [c,d], and y(x) = d for irrational x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous on [c,d], but on [a,c), y(x)=x, which is continuous. So overall, y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence y is a discontinuous function. Therefore, this would work.

Wait, but when x is in [c,d], y(x) must lie in [a,x], but c ≤ x ≤ d, so if we choose y(x) = c or d, as long as c and d are ≤ x. Wait, but d is greater than c, and x is in [c,d]. So for x in [c,d], if we choose y(x) = d, then d must be ≤ x, but x ≤ d. So y(x)=d only works when x=d. So if x is in [c,d), then d is not ≤ x, so y(x) can&#x27;t be d. Therefore, in this case, if f is constant on [c,d], then for x in [c,d], y(x) must be a point in [a,x] where f(y(x))=c. Since f is c on [c,d], then y(x) can be any point in [c,x], since f(y(x))=c. So if we set y(x) = x for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s continuous. But if we choose y(x) to be c for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s also continuous. But if we set y(x) to sometimes be c and sometimes be other points in [c,x] in a discontinuous way.

For example, let’s define y(x) = c if x is rational, and y(x) = x if x is irrational, for x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous because in any neighborhood of a rational point, there are irrationals where y takes the value x, which approaches the rational point, so the limit would be the rational point, but y at the rational point is c, which is different unless c equals the rational point. Wait, c is a fixed point. Wait, if c is the left endpoint of the interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], if we define y(x) = c for x rational and y(x)=x for x irrational, then at any rational point x0 in [c,d], the function y(x) at x0 is c, but the limit as x approaches x0 from irrationals would be x0, which is not equal to c unless x0 = c. So at x=c, y is continuous because approaching from the right (if c &lt; d), y(x) approaches c (since irrationals approach c, but y(x)=x approaches c, and y(c)=c). But at any x0 &gt; c in [c,d], if x0 is rational, then y(x0)=c, but the limit from the irrationals is x0 ≠ c. So y is discontinuous at every rational point in (c,d]. Similarly, at irrational points x0, y is continuous because approaching from rationals, y approaches c, but y(x0)=x0. Unless c = x0, which only occurs at x0=c. Therefore, y is discontinuous at all rational points in (c,d]. Hence, y is discontinuous on a dense subset of [c,d], hence y is discontinuous everywhere on [c,d] except possibly at c.

Therefore, this y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence discontinuous overall. Therefore, even with a non-constant f (since f increases on [a,c] and is constant on [c,d], then decreases on [d,b]), we can construct a discontinuous y.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. So whether f is constant or not, we can have a discontinuous y. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But to make sure, let me think of another example. Suppose f is a sine wave on [0, 2π], continuous of course. The supremum on [0,x] would be 1 once x reaches π/2, since sin(π/2)=1, and then after that, the supremum remains 1. So for x ≥ π/2, y(x) must be π/2. For x &lt; π/2, y(x) must be x, since sin(x) is increasing on [0, π/2]. Therefore, y(x) is x for x ∈ [0, π/2] and π/2 for x ∈ [π/2, 2π]. This y is continuous, since at π/2, the left limit is π/2 and the right limit is π/2. So y is continuous here. But if we modify y(x) for x ≥ π/2 to sometimes be π/2 and sometimes other points where f is 1. Wait, but after π/2, the maximum is always 1, which is achieved at π/2 and also at 3π/2, but wait, sin(3π/2) is -1, which is not the supremum. Wait, no, on [0, x], for x ≥ π/2, the supremum is 1, achieved only at π/2. Because after π/2, sin decreases to 0 at π, then negative values, so the maximum remains 1. So y(x) must be π/2 for x ≥ π/2. Therefore, y(x) is forced to be π/2 there, hence continuous. So in this case, even with a non-constant f, y is continuous.

So in some cases, even if f is non-constant, y has to be continuous. But in other cases, like when f has a flat part, we can make y discontinuous. Therefore, the existence depends on the function f. But the problem asks whether there exists any continuous f and discontinuous y such that the equation holds. So as long as there is at least one such pair, the answer is yes. Since we have examples where f is constant or has flat parts allowing y to be discontinuous, the answer is yes.

Another angle: suppose f is such that its maximum on [a,x] is not uniquely attained. Then y(x) can choose any maximum point, and by choosing different points in a discontinuous way, y can be made discontinuous. However, for continuous f, the set of maximum points on [a,x] is a closed set, and if the maximum is not unique, it&#x27;s a closed interval. So for example, if f is constant on some interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], the maximum is attained on [c,x], which includes [c,x], so if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c and sometimes x in a discontinuous way, then y would be discontinuous.

But in order for the maximum not to be unique, f needs to be constant on some interval. If f is strictly increasing, then the maximum is unique (at x), so y(x) must be x. If f is non-strictly increasing, like with a flat part, then the maximum is not unique on that flat part.

Therefore, to have a discontinuous y, f must be non-strictly monotonic or have intervals where it&#x27;s constant. Therefore, such f exists, and for those f, we can construct discontinuous y. Hence, the answer is yes.

So, in summary, yes, such functions exist. For example, take f to be constant on [a,b], then any discontinuous y(x) ∈ [a,x] works. Or take f to have a flat part where y can be discontinuous, while keeping f continuous.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether there exists a continuous function \( f \) and a discontinuous function \( y \) such that the equation \(\sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) = f(y(x))\) holds for all \( x \in I = [a, b] \), we analyze the following key points:

1. **Supremum and Maximum**: For a continuous function \( f \) on a closed interval \([a, x]\), the supremum is attained as the maximum value. Therefore, there exists some \( y(x) \in [a, x] \) such that \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

2. **Constant Function Example**: If \( f \) is a constant function, then \( f(y(x)) \) will always equal the constant value for any \( y(x) \in [a, x] \). In this case, \( y(x) \) can be any function, including a discontinuous one. For example, \( y(x) \) could be defined as \( a \) for rational \( x \) and \( x \) for irrational \( x \), resulting in a discontinuous \( y \).

3. **Non-Constant Function Example**: For non-constant continuous functions \( f \) with intervals where \( f \) is constant or has flat parts, \( y(x) \) can be discontinuous on those intervals. For instance, if \( f \) is constant on a subinterval \([c, d]\), \( y(x) \) can jump between different points in \([a, x]\) while still satisfying \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

4. **Verification**: Even if \( f \) is non-constant, as long as there are intervals where the maximum is not uniquely attained (e.g., flat parts), \( y(x) \) can be chosen discontinuously. For example, defining \( y(x) \) to jump between endpoints of the flat part in a discontinuous manner.

Thus, there exist continuous functions \( f \) and discontinuous functions \( y \) that satisfy the given equation. Examples include constant functions with discontinuous \( y \) and non-constant functions with flat parts allowing discontinuous \( y \).

But does this satisfy the equation? For x in [a, c], sup f(t) is the constant value, and y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so as long as f is constant on [a, c], f(y(x)) will equal the sup. For x in [c, b], sup f(t) is f(x) since f is increasing there, so y(x) must be x. So if we define y(x) to be, say, a for x in [a, c), and x for x in [c, b], then y is discontinuous at c (since left limit is a, right limit is c, and y(c) = c). So that&#x27;s a discontinuity at c. So this y is discontinuous, and f is continuous (constant on [a, c], increasing on [c, b]). Therefore, this would satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe even simpler: take f to be constant on the entire interval [a, b]. Then y can be any function from [a, b] to [a, b], as long as y(x) is in [a, x]. For example, define y(x) = a for all x except at some point, say x = c, where y(c) = c. Then y is discontinuous at c if we define it that way. Since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the constant value, which equals the sup. So in this case, y is discontinuous (has a jump at c) and f is continuous.

Therefore, such functions do exist. So the answer is yes.

Wait, but the problem says &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So if we can construct even one example where f is continuous and y is discontinuous (even if y is only discontinuous at one point), then the answer is yes. So in the case where f is constant, y can be discontinuous. So yes, such functions exist. So I think the answer is yes, and the example is f constant and y any discontinuous function picking points in [a,x]. But let me verify that.

Suppose f(x) = 1 for all x in [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = 1 for any x. Then we need f(y(x)) = 1, which is true for any y(x) ∈ [a,x] since f(y(x)) =1. So we can choose y(x) to be, for example, a if x is rational, and x if x is irrational. Then y is discontinuous everywhere except possibly at x=a, so y is discontinuous. Therefore, such a function y exists. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But maybe the problem is intended to have f non-constant? Let me check the original problem again. It just says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So even if f is constant, as long as y is discontinuous, that&#x27;s acceptable. Therefore, such a pair exists, so the answer is yes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trickier. Suppose f is not constant. Then can we still have a discontinuous y?

Suppose f is a non-constant continuous function. For example, f(x) = x on [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = f(x) = x. So y(x) must be x. Therefore, y is continuous. So in this case, y must be continuous.

But if f is a non-constant function that attains its maximum at varying points, maybe y can be discontinuous. Wait, but for continuous f, the maximum is attained, and the set of maximum points is a closed set. For example, suppose f is a function that has multiple maxima on some intervals. Wait, but if f is continuous, the set where f attains its maximum on [a,x] could be a single point or multiple points.

Wait, suppose f is such that on some subintervals, the maximum is attained at multiple points. For example, f is a constant on some subintervals. Wait, but even then, if we have to choose y(x) as one of those points, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, then on those parts y(x) has to be continuous.

Wait, maybe f could be a function that has plateaus. For example, f(x) is increasing up to some point, then constant, then decreasing. Then on the increasing part, y(x) =x, on the constant part, y(x) can be any point in [a,x], so we could choose to make y discontinuous there, and on the decreasing part, y(x) must be the point where the plateau is. So overall, y could have discontinuities in the constant part.

But if the problem allows y to be discontinuous only on parts where f is constant, but continuous elsewhere, then overall y is discontinuous. But f is still continuous.

But in this case, even though f is non-constant (since it&#x27;s increasing and decreasing), but with a flat part, we can have a y that&#x27;s discontinuous on the flat part.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. For example, take f(x) = x on [a, c], f(x) = c on [c, d], and f(x) = d - x on [d, b], where a &lt; c &lt; d &lt; b. Then on [a, c], sup f(t) on [a,x] is f(x) =x, so y(x) =x. On [c, d], sup f(t) is f(c) = c, so y(x) can be any point in [a,x] that maps to c. Since c is in [a,x] for x ≥ c, we can choose y(x) = c for x in [c, d]. On [d, b], sup f(t) is still c, so y(x) must be c. Therefore, y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So overall, y(x) is x for x in [a,c), and c for x in [c, b]. This function y(x) is continuous on [a,c) and constant on [c,b], but at x=c, the left limit is c (since approaching from the left, y approaches c), and y(c)=c. So actually, y is continuous at c as well. Wait, no. Wait, for x approaching c from the left, y(x) approaches c, and y(c) = c. So y is continuous at c. Therefore, y is continuous everywhere. So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, so maybe even with a flat part, if we try to make y discontinuous, the requirement that sup f(t) = f(y(x)) forces y(x) to be c for x ≥ c. So y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So if we set y(x) = c for x ≥ c, that&#x27;s continuous. But if we tried to make y(x) jump around in the flat part, but since the sup is still c, y(x) has to be a point where f(y(x))=c. So if f is constant on [c, d], then any y(x) in [c, x] would work, but if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c, sometimes d, but since f is constant on [c,d], then f(y(x)) is still c. So y(x) could be discontinuous on [c, d]. For example, define y(x) = c for rational x in [c,d], and y(x) = d for irrational x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous on [c,d], but on [a,c), y(x)=x, which is continuous. So overall, y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence y is a discontinuous function. Therefore, this would work.

Wait, but when x is in [c,d], y(x) must lie in [a,x], but c ≤ x ≤ d, so if we choose y(x) = c or d, as long as c and d are ≤ x. Wait, but d is greater than c, and x is in [c,d]. So for x in [c,d], if we choose y(x) = d, then d must be ≤ x, but x ≤ d. So y(x)=d only works when x=d. So if x is in [c,d), then d is not ≤ x, so y(x) can&#x27;t be d. Therefore, in this case, if f is constant on [c,d], then for x in [c,d], y(x) must be a point in [a,x] where f(y(x))=c. Since f is c on [c,d], then y(x) can be any point in [c,x], since f(y(x))=c. So if we set y(x) = x for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s continuous. But if we choose y(x) to be c for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s also continuous. But if we set y(x) to sometimes be c and sometimes be other points in [c,x] in a discontinuous way.

For example, let’s define y(x) = c if x is rational, and y(x) = x if x is irrational, for x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous because in any neighborhood of a rational point, there are irrationals where y takes the value x, which approaches the rational point, so the limit would be the rational point, but y at the rational point is c, which is different unless c equals the rational point. Wait, c is a fixed point. Wait, if c is the left endpoint of the interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], if we define y(x) = c for x rational and y(x)=x for x irrational, then at any rational point x0 in [c,d], the function y(x) at x0 is c, but the limit as x approaches x0 from irrationals would be x0, which is not equal to c unless x0 = c. So at x=c, y is continuous because approaching from the right (if c &lt; d), y(x) approaches c (since irrationals approach c, but y(x)=x approaches c, and y(c)=c). But at any x0 &gt; c in [c,d], if x0 is rational, then y(x0)=c, but the limit from the irrationals is x0 ≠ c. So y is discontinuous at every rational point in (c,d]. Similarly, at irrational points x0, y is continuous because approaching from rationals, y approaches c, but y(x0)=x0. Unless c = x0, which only occurs at x0=c. Therefore, y is discontinuous at all rational points in (c,d]. Hence, y is discontinuous on a dense subset of [c,d], hence y is discontinuous everywhere on [c,d] except possibly at c.

Therefore, this y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence discontinuous overall. Therefore, even with a non-constant f (since f increases on [a,c] and is constant on [c,d], then decreases on [d,b]), we can construct a discontinuous y.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. So whether f is constant or not, we can have a discontinuous y. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But to make sure, let me think of another example. Suppose f is a sine wave on [0, 2π], continuous of course. The supremum on [0,x] would be 1 once x reaches π/2, since sin(π/2)=1, and then after that, the supremum remains 1. So for x ≥ π/2, y(x) must be π/2. For x &lt; π/2, y(x) must be x, since sin(x) is increasing on [0, π/2]. Therefore, y(x) is x for x ∈ [0, π/2] and π/2 for x ∈ [π/2, 2π]. This y is continuous, since at π/2, the left limit is π/2 and the right limit is π/2. So y is continuous here. But if we modify y(x) for x ≥ π/2 to sometimes be π/2 and sometimes other points where f is 1. Wait, but after π/2, the maximum is always 1, which is achieved at π/2 and also at 3π/2, but wait, sin(3π/2) is -1, which is not the supremum. Wait, no, on [0, x], for x ≥ π/2, the supremum is 1, achieved only at π/2. Because after π/2, sin decreases to 0 at π, then negative values, so the maximum remains 1. So y(x) must be π/2 for x ≥ π/2. Therefore, y(x) is forced to be π/2 there, hence continuous. So in this case, even with a non-constant f, y is continuous.

So in some cases, even if f is non-constant, y has to be continuous. But in other cases, like when f has a flat part, we can make y discontinuous. Therefore, the existence depends on the function f. But the problem asks whether there exists any continuous f and discontinuous y such that the equation holds. So as long as there is at least one such pair, the answer is yes. Since we have examples where f is constant or has flat parts allowing y to be discontinuous, the answer is yes.

Another angle: suppose f is such that its maximum on [a,x] is not uniquely attained. Then y(x) can choose any maximum point, and by choosing different points in a discontinuous way, y can be made discontinuous. However, for continuous f, the set of maximum points on [a,x] is a closed set, and if the maximum is not unique, it&#x27;s a closed interval. So for example, if f is constant on some interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], the maximum is attained on [c,x], which includes [c,x], so if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c and sometimes x in a discontinuous way, then y would be discontinuous.

But in order for the maximum not to be unique, f needs to be constant on some interval. If f is strictly increasing, then the maximum is unique (at x), so y(x) must be x. If f is non-strictly increasing, like with a flat part, then the maximum is not unique on that flat part.

Therefore, to have a discontinuous y, f must be non-strictly monotonic or have intervals where it&#x27;s constant. Therefore, such f exists, and for those f, we can construct discontinuous y. Hence, the answer is yes.

So, in summary, yes, such functions exist. For example, take f to be constant on [a,b], then any discontinuous y(x) ∈ [a,x] works. Or take f to have a flat part where y can be discontinuous, while keeping f continuous.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether there exists a continuous function \( f \) and a discontinuous function \( y \) such that the equation \(\sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) = f(y(x))\) holds for all \( x \in I = [a, b] \), we analyze the following key points:

1. **Supremum and Maximum**: For a continuous function \( f \) on a closed interval \([a, x]\), the supremum is attained as the maximum value. Therefore, there exists some \( y(x) \in [a, x] \) such that \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

2. **Constant Function Example**: If \( f \) is a constant function, then \( f(y(x)) \) will always equal the constant value for any \( y(x) \in [a, x] \). In this case, \( y(x) \) can be any function, including a discontinuous one. For example, \( y(x) \) could be defined as \( a \) for rational \( x \) and \( x \) for irrational \( x \), resulting in a discontinuous \( y \).

3. **Non-Constant Function Example**: For non-constant continuous functions \( f \) with intervals where \( f \) is constant or has flat parts, \( y(x) \) can be discontinuous on those intervals. For instance, if \( f \) is constant on a subinterval \([c, d]\), \( y(x) \) can jump between different points in \([a, x]\) while still satisfying \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

4. **Verification**: Even if \( f \) is non-constant, as long as there are intervals where the maximum is not uniquely attained (e.g., flat parts), \( y(x) \) can be chosen discontinuously. For example, defining \( y(x) \) to jump between endpoints of the flat part in a discontinuous manner.

Thus, there exist continuous functions \( f \) and discontinuous functions \( y \) that satisfy the given equation. Examples include constant functions with discontinuous \( y \) and non-constant functions with flat parts allowing discontinuous \( y \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if there&#x27;s a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y such that for every x in the interval [a,b], the supremum of f on [a,x] is equal to f(y(x)). Hmm, interesting. Let me break this down.

First, the supremum of f on [a,x] is just the maximum value of f on that interval since f is continuous on a closed interval, right? Because continuous functions on compact intervals attain their maximum and minimum. So, sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = max_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t). Therefore, there must be some point y(x) in [a,x] where f(y(x)) is equal to this maximum.

So y(x) is a function that picks out a point in [a,x] where f attains its maximum. The question is whether y can be discontinuous while f is continuous.

Let me think of some examples. Suppose f is a constant function. Then every point in [a,x] is a maximum, so y(x) could be any function from I to [a,x]. But since f is constant, even if y is discontinuous, f(y(x)) would still be constant, which matches the supremum. However, the problem states that y should be discontinuous. If f is constant, then y could be discontinuous, but maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that f has to be non-constant. So technically, yes, if f is constant, then y can be any function, including a discontinuous one. But maybe the problem is more interesting if f is non-constant. Let me check the problem statement again.

It says &quot;a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y&quot;. So it doesn&#x27;t specify that f must be non-constant, so maybe the answer is yes, and the example is a constant function f and any discontinuous y. But wait, if f is constant, then f(y(x)) is constant, which equals the supremum, which is also constant. So in that case, y can be any function, even a discontinuous one. So this would satisfy the equation. So in this case, such functions exist. But maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So as long as there exists any continuous f (could be constant) and some discontinuous y that works. Since in the case of constant f, y can be discontinuous, then the answer would be yes. But maybe the problem is intended to consider non-constant f? Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe even for non-constant f, can we have a discontinuous y? Let&#x27;s consider a non-constant f. Suppose f is increasing. Then the supremum on [a,x] is f(x), so y(x) must equal x. Then y is continuous, so that&#x27;s not helpful. If f is decreasing, then the supremum on [a,x] is f(a), so y(x) must be a for all x. But then y is constant, hence continuous. So in these cases, y is forced to be continuous.

What if f has a maximum somewhere in the middle? For example, suppose f is a function that increases up to some point c in [a,b] and then decreases. Then the supremum on [a,x] for x ≤ c would be f(x), and for x ≥ c, it would be f(c). So in that case, for x ≥ c, y(x) must be c. But for x &lt; c, y(x) must be x. So y(x) would be x for x &lt; c and c for x ≥ c. Is this function y discontinuous?

At x = c, left limit of y(x) as x approaches c from below is c, and the right limit is c, and y(c) = c, so it&#x27;s continuous at c. So y is continuous here. So even if f has a peak, y is still continuous.

Wait, but what if the maximum is not unique? For example, suppose f is constant on some interval. If f is constant on [a, d] for some d &gt; a, then any y(x) in [a, x] would work for x ≤ d. But if we choose y(x) to jump around, could that make y discontinuous? For example, suppose f is constant on [a, d], then for x in [a, d], y(x) could be a, then jump to some other point in [a, x], but since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the supremum. So in this case, y could be discontinuous on [a, d], but continuous elsewhere. However, the problem requires y to be discontinuous on the entire interval I = [a, b]. So if we only have y discontinuous on a subinterval, is that acceptable?

Wait, the problem states &quot;for all x ∈ I&quot;, so y needs to be defined on I, and the equation has to hold for all x in I. If f is constant on part of the interval, we can make y discontinuous there, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, y might have to be continuous there. So maybe we can construct an f that&#x27;s constant on some part and non-constant on another, allowing y to be discontinuous on the constant part but continuous on the non-constant part. But then y would not be entirely discontinuous on I. The problem requires y to be discontinuous, not necessarily discontinuous everywhere. So if y has at least one point of discontinuity, it&#x27;s considered discontinuous.

So if we have f constant on some subinterval, say [a, c], and non-constant on [c, b], then on [a, c], y can be discontinuous, and on [c, b], y has to be continuous. So overall y is discontinuous. For example, let f be constant on [a, c] and then increasing on [c, b]. Then on [a, c], y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so we can choose y(x) to jump around, like sometimes a, sometimes x, creating discontinuities. Then on [c, b], y(x) must be x. So overall, y would be discontinuous on [a, c] and continuous on [c, b]. But as long as there is at least one point of discontinuity, y is a discontinuous function. So such a function y exists.

But does this satisfy the equation? For x in [a, c], sup f(t) is the constant value, and y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so as long as f is constant on [a, c], f(y(x)) will equal the sup. For x in [c, b], sup f(t) is f(x) since f is increasing there, so y(x) must be x. So if we define y(x) to be, say, a for x in [a, c), and x for x in [c, b], then y is discontinuous at c (since left limit is a, right limit is c, and y(c) = c). So that&#x27;s a discontinuity at c. So this y is discontinuous, and f is continuous (constant on [a, c], increasing on [c, b]). Therefore, this would satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe even simpler: take f to be constant on the entire interval [a, b]. Then y can be any function from [a, b] to [a, b], as long as y(x) is in [a, x]. For example, define y(x) = a for all x except at some point, say x = c, where y(c) = c. Then y is discontinuous at c if we define it that way. Since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the constant value, which equals the sup. So in this case, y is discontinuous (has a jump at c) and f is continuous.

Therefore, such functions do exist. So the answer is yes.

Wait, but the problem says &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So if we can construct even one example where f is continuous and y is discontinuous (even if y is only discontinuous at one point), then the answer is yes. So in the case where f is constant, y can be discontinuous. So yes, such functions exist. So I think the answer is yes, and the example is f constant and y any discontinuous function picking points in [a,x]. But let me verify that.

Suppose f(x) = 1 for all x in [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = 1 for any x. Then we need f(y(x)) = 1, which is true for any y(x) ∈ [a,x] since f(y(x)) =1. So we can choose y(x) to be, for example, a if x is rational, and x if x is irrational. Then y is discontinuous everywhere except possibly at x=a, so y is discontinuous. Therefore, such a function y exists. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But maybe the problem is intended to have f non-constant? Let me check the original problem again. It just says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So even if f is constant, as long as y is discontinuous, that&#x27;s acceptable. Therefore, such a pair exists, so the answer is yes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trickier. Suppose f is not constant. Then can we still have a discontinuous y?

Suppose f is a non-constant continuous function. For example, f(x) = x on [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = f(x) = x. So y(x) must be x. Therefore, y is continuous. So in this case, y must be continuous.

But if f is a non-constant function that attains its maximum at varying points, maybe y can be discontinuous. Wait, but for continuous f, the maximum is attained, and the set of maximum points is a closed set. For example, suppose f is a function that has multiple maxima on some intervals. Wait, but if f is continuous, the set where f attains its maximum on [a,x] could be a single point or multiple points.

Wait, suppose f is such that on some subintervals, the maximum is attained at multiple points. For example, f is a constant on some subintervals. Wait, but even then, if we have to choose y(x) as one of those points, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, then on those parts y(x) has to be continuous.

Wait, maybe f could be a function that has plateaus. For example, f(x) is increasing up to some point, then constant, then decreasing. Then on the increasing part, y(x) =x, on the constant part, y(x) can be any point in [a,x], so we could choose to make y discontinuous there, and on the decreasing part, y(x) must be the point where the plateau is. So overall, y could have discontinuities in the constant part.

But if the problem allows y to be discontinuous only on parts where f is constant, but continuous elsewhere, then overall y is discontinuous. But f is still continuous.

But in this case, even though f is non-constant (since it&#x27;s increasing and decreasing), but with a flat part, we can have a y that&#x27;s discontinuous on the flat part.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. For example, take f(x) = x on [a, c], f(x) = c on [c, d], and f(x) = d - x on [d, b], where a &lt; c &lt; d &lt; b. Then on [a, c], sup f(t) on [a,x] is f(x) =x, so y(x) =x. On [c, d], sup f(t) is f(c) = c, so y(x) can be any point in [a,x] that maps to c. Since c is in [a,x] for x ≥ c, we can choose y(x) = c for x in [c, d]. On [d, b], sup f(t) is still c, so y(x) must be c. Therefore, y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So overall, y(x) is x for x in [a,c), and c for x in [c, b]. This function y(x) is continuous on [a,c) and constant on [c,b], but at x=c, the left limit is c (since approaching from the left, y approaches c), and y(c)=c. So actually, y is continuous at c as well. Wait, no. Wait, for x approaching c from the left, y(x) approaches c, and y(c) = c. So y is continuous at c. Therefore, y is continuous everywhere. So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, so maybe even with a flat part, if we try to make y discontinuous, the requirement that sup f(t) = f(y(x)) forces y(x) to be c for x ≥ c. So y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So if we set y(x) = c for x ≥ c, that&#x27;s continuous. But if we tried to make y(x) jump around in the flat part, but since the sup is still c, y(x) has to be a point where f(y(x))=c. So if f is constant on [c, d], then any y(x) in [c, x] would work, but if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c, sometimes d, but since f is constant on [c,d], then f(y(x)) is still c. So y(x) could be discontinuous on [c, d]. For example, define y(x) = c for rational x in [c,d], and y(x) = d for irrational x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous on [c,d], but on [a,c), y(x)=x, which is continuous. So overall, y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence y is a discontinuous function. Therefore, this would work.

Wait, but when x is in [c,d], y(x) must lie in [a,x], but c ≤ x ≤ d, so if we choose y(x) = c or d, as long as c and d are ≤ x. Wait, but d is greater than c, and x is in [c,d]. So for x in [c,d], if we choose y(x) = d, then d must be ≤ x, but x ≤ d. So y(x)=d only works when x=d. So if x is in [c,d), then d is not ≤ x, so y(x) can&#x27;t be d. Therefore, in this case, if f is constant on [c,d], then for x in [c,d], y(x) must be a point in [a,x] where f(y(x))=c. Since f is c on [c,d], then y(x) can be any point in [c,x], since f(y(x))=c. So if we set y(x) = x for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s continuous. But if we choose y(x) to be c for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s also continuous. But if we set y(x) to sometimes be c and sometimes be other points in [c,x] in a discontinuous way.

For example, let’s define y(x) = c if x is rational, and y(x) = x if x is irrational, for x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous because in any neighborhood of a rational point, there are irrationals where y takes the value x, which approaches the rational point, so the limit would be the rational point, but y at the rational point is c, which is different unless c equals the rational point. Wait, c is a fixed point. Wait, if c is the left endpoint of the interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], if we define y(x) = c for x rational and y(x)=x for x irrational, then at any rational point x0 in [c,d], the function y(x) at x0 is c, but the limit as x approaches x0 from irrationals would be x0, which is not equal to c unless x0 = c. So at x=c, y is continuous because approaching from the right (if c &lt; d), y(x) approaches c (since irrationals approach c, but y(x)=x approaches c, and y(c)=c). But at any x0 &gt; c in [c,d], if x0 is rational, then y(x0)=c, but the limit from the irrationals is x0 ≠ c. So y is discontinuous at every rational point in (c,d]. Similarly, at irrational points x0, y is continuous because approaching from rationals, y approaches c, but y(x0)=x0. Unless c = x0, which only occurs at x0=c. Therefore, y is discontinuous at all rational points in (c,d]. Hence, y is discontinuous on a dense subset of [c,d], hence y is discontinuous everywhere on [c,d] except possibly at c.

Therefore, this y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence discontinuous overall. Therefore, even with a non-constant f (since f increases on [a,c] and is constant on [c,d], then decreases on [d,b]), we can construct a discontinuous y.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. So whether f is constant or not, we can have a discontinuous y. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But to make sure, let me think of another example. Suppose f is a sine wave on [0, 2π], continuous of course. The supremum on [0,x] would be 1 once x reaches π/2, since sin(π/2)=1, and then after that, the supremum remains 1. So for x ≥ π/2, y(x) must be π/2. For x &lt; π/2, y(x) must be x, since sin(x) is increasing on [0, π/2]. Therefore, y(x) is x for x ∈ [0, π/2] and π/2 for x ∈ [π/2, 2π]. This y is continuous, since at π/2, the left limit is π/2 and the right limit is π/2. So y is continuous here. But if we modify y(x) for x ≥ π/2 to sometimes be π/2 and sometimes other points where f is 1. Wait, but after π/2, the maximum is always 1, which is achieved at π/2 and also at 3π/2, but wait, sin(3π/2) is -1, which is not the supremum. Wait, no, on [0, x], for x ≥ π/2, the supremum is 1, achieved only at π/2. Because after π/2, sin decreases to 0 at π, then negative values, so the maximum remains 1. So y(x) must be π/2 for x ≥ π/2. Therefore, y(x) is forced to be π/2 there, hence continuous. So in this case, even with a non-constant f, y is continuous.

So in some cases, even if f is non-constant, y has to be continuous. But in other cases, like when f has a flat part, we can make y discontinuous. Therefore, the existence depends on the function f. But the problem asks whether there exists any continuous f and discontinuous y such that the equation holds. So as long as there is at least one such pair, the answer is yes. Since we have examples where f is constant or has flat parts allowing y to be discontinuous, the answer is yes.

Another angle: suppose f is such that its maximum on [a,x] is not uniquely attained. Then y(x) can choose any maximum point, and by choosing different points in a discontinuous way, y can be made discontinuous. However, for continuous f, the set of maximum points on [a,x] is a closed set, and if the maximum is not unique, it&#x27;s a closed interval. So for example, if f is constant on some interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], the maximum is attained on [c,x], which includes [c,x], so if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c and sometimes x in a discontinuous way, then y would be discontinuous.

But in order for the maximum not to be unique, f needs to be constant on some interval. If f is strictly increasing, then the maximum is unique (at x), so y(x) must be x. If f is non-strictly increasing, like with a flat part, then the maximum is not unique on that flat part.

Therefore, to have a discontinuous y, f must be non-strictly monotonic or have intervals where it&#x27;s constant. Therefore, such f exists, and for those f, we can construct discontinuous y. Hence, the answer is yes.

So, in summary, yes, such functions exist. For example, take f to be constant on [a,b], then any discontinuous y(x) ∈ [a,x] works. Or take f to have a flat part where y can be discontinuous, while keeping f continuous.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether there exists a continuous function \( f \) and a discontinuous function \( y \) such that the equation \(\sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) = f(y(x))\) holds for all \( x \in I = [a, b] \), we analyze the following key points:

1. **Supremum and Maximum**: For a continuous function \( f \) on a closed interval \([a, x]\), the supremum is attained as the maximum value. Therefore, there exists some \( y(x) \in [a, x] \) such that \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

2. **Constant Function Example**: If \( f \) is a constant function, then \( f(y(x)) \) will always equal the constant value for any \( y(x) \in [a, x] \). In this case, \( y(x) \) can be any function, including a discontinuous one. For example, \( y(x) \) could be defined as \( a \) for rational \( x \) and \( x \) for irrational \( x \), resulting in a discontinuous \( y \).

3. **Non-Constant Function Example**: For non-constant continuous functions \( f \) with intervals where \( f \) is constant or has flat parts, \( y(x) \) can be discontinuous on those intervals. For instance, if \( f \) is constant on a subinterval \([c, d]\), \( y(x) \) can jump between different points in \([a, x]\) while still satisfying \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

4. **Verification**: Even if \( f \) is non-constant, as long as there are intervals where the maximum is not uniquely attained (e.g., flat parts), \( y(x) \) can be chosen discontinuously. For example, defining \( y(x) \) to jump between endpoints of the flat part in a discontinuous manner.

Thus, there exist continuous functions \( f \) and discontinuous functions \( y \) that satisfy the given equation. Examples include constant functions with discontinuous \( y \) and non-constant functions with flat parts allowing discontinuous \( y \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if there&#x27;s a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y such that for every x in the interval [a,b], the supremum of f on [a,x] is equal to f(y(x)). Hmm, interesting. Let me break this down.

First, the supremum of f on [a,x] is just the maximum value of f on that interval since f is continuous on a closed interval, right? Because continuous functions on compact intervals attain their maximum and minimum. So, sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = max_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t). Therefore, there must be some point y(x) in [a,x] where f(y(x)) is equal to this maximum.

So y(x) is a function that picks out a point in [a,x] where f attains its maximum. The question is whether y can be discontinuous while f is continuous.

Let me think of some examples. Suppose f is a constant function. Then every point in [a,x] is a maximum, so y(x) could be any function from I to [a,x]. But since f is constant, even if y is discontinuous, f(y(x)) would still be constant, which matches the supremum. However, the problem states that y should be discontinuous. If f is constant, then y could be discontinuous, but maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that f has to be non-constant. So technically, yes, if f is constant, then y can be any function, including a discontinuous one. But maybe the problem is more interesting if f is non-constant. Let me check the problem statement again.

It says &quot;a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y&quot;. So it doesn&#x27;t specify that f must be non-constant, so maybe the answer is yes, and the example is a constant function f and any discontinuous y. But wait, if f is constant, then f(y(x)) is constant, which equals the supremum, which is also constant. So in that case, y can be any function, even a discontinuous one. So this would satisfy the equation. So in this case, such functions exist. But maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So as long as there exists any continuous f (could be constant) and some discontinuous y that works. Since in the case of constant f, y can be discontinuous, then the answer would be yes. But maybe the problem is intended to consider non-constant f? Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe even for non-constant f, can we have a discontinuous y? Let&#x27;s consider a non-constant f. Suppose f is increasing. Then the supremum on [a,x] is f(x), so y(x) must equal x. Then y is continuous, so that&#x27;s not helpful. If f is decreasing, then the supremum on [a,x] is f(a), so y(x) must be a for all x. But then y is constant, hence continuous. So in these cases, y is forced to be continuous.

What if f has a maximum somewhere in the middle? For example, suppose f is a function that increases up to some point c in [a,b] and then decreases. Then the supremum on [a,x] for x ≤ c would be f(x), and for x ≥ c, it would be f(c). So in that case, for x ≥ c, y(x) must be c. But for x &lt; c, y(x) must be x. So y(x) would be x for x &lt; c and c for x ≥ c. Is this function y discontinuous?

At x = c, left limit of y(x) as x approaches c from below is c, and the right limit is c, and y(c) = c, so it&#x27;s continuous at c. So y is continuous here. So even if f has a peak, y is still continuous.

Wait, but what if the maximum is not unique? For example, suppose f is constant on some interval. If f is constant on [a, d] for some d &gt; a, then any y(x) in [a, x] would work for x ≤ d. But if we choose y(x) to jump around, could that make y discontinuous? For example, suppose f is constant on [a, d], then for x in [a, d], y(x) could be a, then jump to some other point in [a, x], but since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the supremum. So in this case, y could be discontinuous on [a, d], but continuous elsewhere. However, the problem requires y to be discontinuous on the entire interval I = [a, b]. So if we only have y discontinuous on a subinterval, is that acceptable?

Wait, the problem states &quot;for all x ∈ I&quot;, so y needs to be defined on I, and the equation has to hold for all x in I. If f is constant on part of the interval, we can make y discontinuous there, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, y might have to be continuous there. So maybe we can construct an f that&#x27;s constant on some part and non-constant on another, allowing y to be discontinuous on the constant part but continuous on the non-constant part. But then y would not be entirely discontinuous on I. The problem requires y to be discontinuous, not necessarily discontinuous everywhere. So if y has at least one point of discontinuity, it&#x27;s considered discontinuous.

So if we have f constant on some subinterval, say [a, c], and non-constant on [c, b], then on [a, c], y can be discontinuous, and on [c, b], y has to be continuous. So overall y is discontinuous. For example, let f be constant on [a, c] and then increasing on [c, b]. Then on [a, c], y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so we can choose y(x) to jump around, like sometimes a, sometimes x, creating discontinuities. Then on [c, b], y(x) must be x. So overall, y would be discontinuous on [a, c] and continuous on [c, b]. But as long as there is at least one point of discontinuity, y is a discontinuous function. So such a function y exists.

But does this satisfy the equation? For x in [a, c], sup f(t) is the constant value, and y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so as long as f is constant on [a, c], f(y(x)) will equal the sup. For x in [c, b], sup f(t) is f(x) since f is increasing there, so y(x) must be x. So if we define y(x) to be, say, a for x in [a, c), and x for x in [c, b], then y is discontinuous at c (since left limit is a, right limit is c, and y(c) = c). So that&#x27;s a discontinuity at c. So this y is discontinuous, and f is continuous (constant on [a, c], increasing on [c, b]). Therefore, this would satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe even simpler: take f to be constant on the entire interval [a, b]. Then y can be any function from [a, b] to [a, b], as long as y(x) is in [a, x]. For example, define y(x) = a for all x except at some point, say x = c, where y(c) = c. Then y is discontinuous at c if we define it that way. Since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the constant value, which equals the sup. So in this case, y is discontinuous (has a jump at c) and f is continuous.

Therefore, such functions do exist. So the answer is yes.

Wait, but the problem says &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So if we can construct even one example where f is continuous and y is discontinuous (even if y is only discontinuous at one point), then the answer is yes. So in the case where f is constant, y can be discontinuous. So yes, such functions exist. So I think the answer is yes, and the example is f constant and y any discontinuous function picking points in [a,x]. But let me verify that.

Suppose f(x) = 1 for all x in [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = 1 for any x. Then we need f(y(x)) = 1, which is true for any y(x) ∈ [a,x] since f(y(x)) =1. So we can choose y(x) to be, for example, a if x is rational, and x if x is irrational. Then y is discontinuous everywhere except possibly at x=a, so y is discontinuous. Therefore, such a function y exists. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But maybe the problem is intended to have f non-constant? Let me check the original problem again. It just says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So even if f is constant, as long as y is discontinuous, that&#x27;s acceptable. Therefore, such a pair exists, so the answer is yes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trickier. Suppose f is not constant. Then can we still have a discontinuous y?

Suppose f is a non-constant continuous function. For example, f(x) = x on [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = f(x) = x. So y(x) must be x. Therefore, y is continuous. So in this case, y must be continuous.

But if f is a non-constant function that attains its maximum at varying points, maybe y can be discontinuous. Wait, but for continuous f, the maximum is attained, and the set of maximum points is a closed set. For example, suppose f is a function that has multiple maxima on some intervals. Wait, but if f is continuous, the set where f attains its maximum on [a,x] could be a single point or multiple points.

Wait, suppose f is such that on some subintervals, the maximum is attained at multiple points. For example, f is a constant on some subintervals. Wait, but even then, if we have to choose y(x) as one of those points, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, then on those parts y(x) has to be continuous.

Wait, maybe f could be a function that has plateaus. For example, f(x) is increasing up to some point, then constant, then decreasing. Then on the increasing part, y(x) =x, on the constant part, y(x) can be any point in [a,x], so we could choose to make y discontinuous there, and on the decreasing part, y(x) must be the point where the plateau is. So overall, y could have discontinuities in the constant part.

But if the problem allows y to be discontinuous only on parts where f is constant, but continuous elsewhere, then overall y is discontinuous. But f is still continuous.

But in this case, even though f is non-constant (since it&#x27;s increasing and decreasing), but with a flat part, we can have a y that&#x27;s discontinuous on the flat part.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. For example, take f(x) = x on [a, c], f(x) = c on [c, d], and f(x) = d - x on [d, b], where a &lt; c &lt; d &lt; b. Then on [a, c], sup f(t) on [a,x] is f(x) =x, so y(x) =x. On [c, d], sup f(t) is f(c) = c, so y(x) can be any point in [a,x] that maps to c. Since c is in [a,x] for x ≥ c, we can choose y(x) = c for x in [c, d]. On [d, b], sup f(t) is still c, so y(x) must be c. Therefore, y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So overall, y(x) is x for x in [a,c), and c for x in [c, b]. This function y(x) is continuous on [a,c) and constant on [c,b], but at x=c, the left limit is c (since approaching from the left, y approaches c), and y(c)=c. So actually, y is continuous at c as well. Wait, no. Wait, for x approaching c from the left, y(x) approaches c, and y(c) = c. So y is continuous at c. Therefore, y is continuous everywhere. So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, so maybe even with a flat part, if we try to make y discontinuous, the requirement that sup f(t) = f(y(x)) forces y(x) to be c for x ≥ c. So y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So if we set y(x) = c for x ≥ c, that&#x27;s continuous. But if we tried to make y(x) jump around in the flat part, but since the sup is still c, y(x) has to be a point where f(y(x))=c. So if f is constant on [c, d], then any y(x) in [c, x] would work, but if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c, sometimes d, but since f is constant on [c,d], then f(y(x)) is still c. So y(x) could be discontinuous on [c, d]. For example, define y(x) = c for rational x in [c,d], and y(x) = d for irrational x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous on [c,d], but on [a,c), y(x)=x, which is continuous. So overall, y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence y is a discontinuous function. Therefore, this would work.

Wait, but when x is in [c,d], y(x) must lie in [a,x], but c ≤ x ≤ d, so if we choose y(x) = c or d, as long as c and d are ≤ x. Wait, but d is greater than c, and x is in [c,d]. So for x in [c,d], if we choose y(x) = d, then d must be ≤ x, but x ≤ d. So y(x)=d only works when x=d. So if x is in [c,d), then d is not ≤ x, so y(x) can&#x27;t be d. Therefore, in this case, if f is constant on [c,d], then for x in [c,d], y(x) must be a point in [a,x] where f(y(x))=c. Since f is c on [c,d], then y(x) can be any point in [c,x], since f(y(x))=c. So if we set y(x) = x for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s continuous. But if we choose y(x) to be c for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s also continuous. But if we set y(x) to sometimes be c and sometimes be other points in [c,x] in a discontinuous way.

For example, let’s define y(x) = c if x is rational, and y(x) = x if x is irrational, for x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous because in any neighborhood of a rational point, there are irrationals where y takes the value x, which approaches the rational point, so the limit would be the rational point, but y at the rational point is c, which is different unless c equals the rational point. Wait, c is a fixed point. Wait, if c is the left endpoint of the interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], if we define y(x) = c for x rational and y(x)=x for x irrational, then at any rational point x0 in [c,d], the function y(x) at x0 is c, but the limit as x approaches x0 from irrationals would be x0, which is not equal to c unless x0 = c. So at x=c, y is continuous because approaching from the right (if c &lt; d), y(x) approaches c (since irrationals approach c, but y(x)=x approaches c, and y(c)=c). But at any x0 &gt; c in [c,d], if x0 is rational, then y(x0)=c, but the limit from the irrationals is x0 ≠ c. So y is discontinuous at every rational point in (c,d]. Similarly, at irrational points x0, y is continuous because approaching from rationals, y approaches c, but y(x0)=x0. Unless c = x0, which only occurs at x0=c. Therefore, y is discontinuous at all rational points in (c,d]. Hence, y is discontinuous on a dense subset of [c,d], hence y is discontinuous everywhere on [c,d] except possibly at c.

Therefore, this y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence discontinuous overall. Therefore, even with a non-constant f (since f increases on [a,c] and is constant on [c,d], then decreases on [d,b]), we can construct a discontinuous y.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. So whether f is constant or not, we can have a discontinuous y. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But to make sure, let me think of another example. Suppose f is a sine wave on [0, 2π], continuous of course. The supremum on [0,x] would be 1 once x reaches π/2, since sin(π/2)=1, and then after that, the supremum remains 1. So for x ≥ π/2, y(x) must be π/2. For x &lt; π/2, y(x) must be x, since sin(x) is increasing on [0, π/2]. Therefore, y(x) is x for x ∈ [0, π/2] and π/2 for x ∈ [π/2, 2π]. This y is continuous, since at π/2, the left limit is π/2 and the right limit is π/2. So y is continuous here. But if we modify y(x) for x ≥ π/2 to sometimes be π/2 and sometimes other points where f is 1. Wait, but after π/2, the maximum is always 1, which is achieved at π/2 and also at 3π/2, but wait, sin(3π/2) is -1, which is not the supremum. Wait, no, on [0, x], for x ≥ π/2, the supremum is 1, achieved only at π/2. Because after π/2, sin decreases to 0 at π, then negative values, so the maximum remains 1. So y(x) must be π/2 for x ≥ π/2. Therefore, y(x) is forced to be π/2 there, hence continuous. So in this case, even with a non-constant f, y is continuous.

So in some cases, even if f is non-constant, y has to be continuous. But in other cases, like when f has a flat part, we can make y discontinuous. Therefore, the existence depends on the function f. But the problem asks whether there exists any continuous f and discontinuous y such that the equation holds. So as long as there is at least one such pair, the answer is yes. Since we have examples where f is constant or has flat parts allowing y to be discontinuous, the answer is yes.

Another angle: suppose f is such that its maximum on [a,x] is not uniquely attained. Then y(x) can choose any maximum point, and by choosing different points in a discontinuous way, y can be made discontinuous. However, for continuous f, the set of maximum points on [a,x] is a closed set, and if the maximum is not unique, it&#x27;s a closed interval. So for example, if f is constant on some interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], the maximum is attained on [c,x], which includes [c,x], so if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c and sometimes x in a discontinuous way, then y would be discontinuous.

But in order for the maximum not to be unique, f needs to be constant on some interval. If f is strictly increasing, then the maximum is unique (at x), so y(x) must be x. If f is non-strictly increasing, like with a flat part, then the maximum is not unique on that flat part.

Therefore, to have a discontinuous y, f must be non-strictly monotonic or have intervals where it&#x27;s constant. Therefore, such f exists, and for those f, we can construct discontinuous y. Hence, the answer is yes.

So, in summary, yes, such functions exist. For example, take f to be constant on [a,b], then any discontinuous y(x) ∈ [a,x] works. Or take f to have a flat part where y can be discontinuous, while keeping f continuous.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether there exists a continuous function \( f \) and a discontinuous function \( y \) such that the equation \(\sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) = f(y(x))\) holds for all \( x \in I = [a, b] \), we analyze the following key points:

1. **Supremum and Maximum**: For a continuous function \( f \) on a closed interval \([a, x]\), the supremum is attained as the maximum value. Therefore, there exists some \( y(x) \in [a, x] \) such that \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

2. **Constant Function Example**: If \( f \) is a constant function, then \( f(y(x)) \) will always equal the constant value for any \( y(x) \in [a, x] \). In this case, \( y(x) \) can be any function, including a discontinuous one. For example, \( y(x) \) could be defined as \( a \) for rational \( x \) and \( x \) for irrational \( x \), resulting in a discontinuous \( y \).

3. **Non-Constant Function Example**: For non-constant continuous functions \( f \) with intervals where \( f \) is constant or has flat parts, \( y(x) \) can be discontinuous on those intervals. For instance, if \( f \) is constant on a subinterval \([c, d]\), \( y(x) \) can jump between different points in \([a, x]\) while still satisfying \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

4. **Verification**: Even if \( f \) is non-constant, as long as there are intervals where the maximum is not uniquely attained (e.g., flat parts), \( y(x) \) can be chosen discontinuously. For example, defining \( y(x) \) to jump between endpoints of the flat part in a discontinuous manner.

Thus, there exist continuous functions \( f \) and discontinuous functions \( y \) that satisfy the given equation. Examples include constant functions with discontinuous \( y \) and non-constant functions with flat parts allowing discontinuous \( y \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if there&#x27;s a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y such that for every x in the interval [a,b], the supremum of f on [a,x] is equal to f(y(x)). Hmm, interesting. Let me break this down.

First, the supremum of f on [a,x] is just the maximum value of f on that interval since f is continuous on a closed interval, right? Because continuous functions on compact intervals attain their maximum and minimum. So, sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = max_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t). Therefore, there must be some point y(x) in [a,x] where f(y(x)) is equal to this maximum.

So y(x) is a function that picks out a point in [a,x] where f attains its maximum. The question is whether y can be discontinuous while f is continuous.

Let me think of some examples. Suppose f is a constant function. Then every point in [a,x] is a maximum, so y(x) could be any function from I to [a,x]. But since f is constant, even if y is discontinuous, f(y(x)) would still be constant, which matches the supremum. However, the problem states that y should be discontinuous. If f is constant, then y could be discontinuous, but maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that f has to be non-constant. So technically, yes, if f is constant, then y can be any function, including a discontinuous one. But maybe the problem is more interesting if f is non-constant. Let me check the problem statement again.

It says &quot;a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y&quot;. So it doesn&#x27;t specify that f must be non-constant, so maybe the answer is yes, and the example is a constant function f and any discontinuous y. But wait, if f is constant, then f(y(x)) is constant, which equals the supremum, which is also constant. So in that case, y can be any function, even a discontinuous one. So this would satisfy the equation. So in this case, such functions exist. But maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So as long as there exists any continuous f (could be constant) and some discontinuous y that works. Since in the case of constant f, y can be discontinuous, then the answer would be yes. But maybe the problem is intended to consider non-constant f? Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe even for non-constant f, can we have a discontinuous y? Let&#x27;s consider a non-constant f. Suppose f is increasing. Then the supremum on [a,x] is f(x), so y(x) must equal x. Then y is continuous, so that&#x27;s not helpful. If f is decreasing, then the supremum on [a,x] is f(a), so y(x) must be a for all x. But then y is constant, hence continuous. So in these cases, y is forced to be continuous.

What if f has a maximum somewhere in the middle? For example, suppose f is a function that increases up to some point c in [a,b] and then decreases. Then the supremum on [a,x] for x ≤ c would be f(x), and for x ≥ c, it would be f(c). So in that case, for x ≥ c, y(x) must be c. But for x &lt; c, y(x) must be x. So y(x) would be x for x &lt; c and c for x ≥ c. Is this function y discontinuous?

At x = c, left limit of y(x) as x approaches c from below is c, and the right limit is c, and y(c) = c, so it&#x27;s continuous at c. So y is continuous here. So even if f has a peak, y is still continuous.

Wait, but what if the maximum is not unique? For example, suppose f is constant on some interval. If f is constant on [a, d] for some d &gt; a, then any y(x) in [a, x] would work for x ≤ d. But if we choose y(x) to jump around, could that make y discontinuous? For example, suppose f is constant on [a, d], then for x in [a, d], y(x) could be a, then jump to some other point in [a, x], but since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the supremum. So in this case, y could be discontinuous on [a, d], but continuous elsewhere. However, the problem requires y to be discontinuous on the entire interval I = [a, b]. So if we only have y discontinuous on a subinterval, is that acceptable?

Wait, the problem states &quot;for all x ∈ I&quot;, so y needs to be defined on I, and the equation has to hold for all x in I. If f is constant on part of the interval, we can make y discontinuous there, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, y might have to be continuous there. So maybe we can construct an f that&#x27;s constant on some part and non-constant on another, allowing y to be discontinuous on the constant part but continuous on the non-constant part. But then y would not be entirely discontinuous on I. The problem requires y to be discontinuous, not necessarily discontinuous everywhere. So if y has at least one point of discontinuity, it&#x27;s considered discontinuous.

So if we have f constant on some subinterval, say [a, c], and non-constant on [c, b], then on [a, c], y can be discontinuous, and on [c, b], y has to be continuous. So overall y is discontinuous. For example, let f be constant on [a, c] and then increasing on [c, b]. Then on [a, c], y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so we can choose y(x) to jump around, like sometimes a, sometimes x, creating discontinuities. Then on [c, b], y(x) must be x. So overall, y would be discontinuous on [a, c] and continuous on [c, b]. But as long as there is at least one point of discontinuity, y is a discontinuous function. So such a function y exists.

But does this satisfy the equation? For x in [a, c], sup f(t) is the constant value, and y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so as long as f is constant on [a, c], f(y(x)) will equal the sup. For x in [c, b], sup f(t) is f(x) since f is increasing there, so y(x) must be x. So if we define y(x) to be, say, a for x in [a, c), and x for x in [c, b], then y is discontinuous at c (since left limit is a, right limit is c, and y(c) = c). So that&#x27;s a discontinuity at c. So this y is discontinuous, and f is continuous (constant on [a, c], increasing on [c, b]). Therefore, this would satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe even simpler: take f to be constant on the entire interval [a, b]. Then y can be any function from [a, b] to [a, b], as long as y(x) is in [a, x]. For example, define y(x) = a for all x except at some point, say x = c, where y(c) = c. Then y is discontinuous at c if we define it that way. Since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the constant value, which equals the sup. So in this case, y is discontinuous (has a jump at c) and f is continuous.

Therefore, such functions do exist. So the answer is yes.

Wait, but the problem says &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So if we can construct even one example where f is continuous and y is discontinuous (even if y is only discontinuous at one point), then the answer is yes. So in the case where f is constant, y can be discontinuous. So yes, such functions exist. So I think the answer is yes, and the example is f constant and y any discontinuous function picking points in [a,x]. But let me verify that.

Suppose f(x) = 1 for all x in [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = 1 for any x. Then we need f(y(x)) = 1, which is true for any y(x) ∈ [a,x] since f(y(x)) =1. So we can choose y(x) to be, for example, a if x is rational, and x if x is irrational. Then y is discontinuous everywhere except possibly at x=a, so y is discontinuous. Therefore, such a function y exists. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But maybe the problem is intended to have f non-constant? Let me check the original problem again. It just says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So even if f is constant, as long as y is discontinuous, that&#x27;s acceptable. Therefore, such a pair exists, so the answer is yes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trickier. Suppose f is not constant. Then can we still have a discontinuous y?

Suppose f is a non-constant continuous function. For example, f(x) = x on [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = f(x) = x. So y(x) must be x. Therefore, y is continuous. So in this case, y must be continuous.

But if f is a non-constant function that attains its maximum at varying points, maybe y can be discontinuous. Wait, but for continuous f, the maximum is attained, and the set of maximum points is a closed set. For example, suppose f is a function that has multiple maxima on some intervals. Wait, but if f is continuous, the set where f attains its maximum on [a,x] could be a single point or multiple points.

Wait, suppose f is such that on some subintervals, the maximum is attained at multiple points. For example, f is a constant on some subintervals. Wait, but even then, if we have to choose y(x) as one of those points, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, then on those parts y(x) has to be continuous.

Wait, maybe f could be a function that has plateaus. For example, f(x) is increasing up to some point, then constant, then decreasing. Then on the increasing part, y(x) =x, on the constant part, y(x) can be any point in [a,x], so we could choose to make y discontinuous there, and on the decreasing part, y(x) must be the point where the plateau is. So overall, y could have discontinuities in the constant part.

But if the problem allows y to be discontinuous only on parts where f is constant, but continuous elsewhere, then overall y is discontinuous. But f is still continuous.

But in this case, even though f is non-constant (since it&#x27;s increasing and decreasing), but with a flat part, we can have a y that&#x27;s discontinuous on the flat part.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. For example, take f(x) = x on [a, c], f(x) = c on [c, d], and f(x) = d - x on [d, b], where a &lt; c &lt; d &lt; b. Then on [a, c], sup f(t) on [a,x] is f(x) =x, so y(x) =x. On [c, d], sup f(t) is f(c) = c, so y(x) can be any point in [a,x] that maps to c. Since c is in [a,x] for x ≥ c, we can choose y(x) = c for x in [c, d]. On [d, b], sup f(t) is still c, so y(x) must be c. Therefore, y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So overall, y(x) is x for x in [a,c), and c for x in [c, b]. This function y(x) is continuous on [a,c) and constant on [c,b], but at x=c, the left limit is c (since approaching from the left, y approaches c), and y(c)=c. So actually, y is continuous at c as well. Wait, no. Wait, for x approaching c from the left, y(x) approaches c, and y(c) = c. So y is continuous at c. Therefore, y is continuous everywhere. So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, so maybe even with a flat part, if we try to make y discontinuous, the requirement that sup f(t) = f(y(x)) forces y(x) to be c for x ≥ c. So y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So if we set y(x) = c for x ≥ c, that&#x27;s continuous. But if we tried to make y(x) jump around in the flat part, but since the sup is still c, y(x) has to be a point where f(y(x))=c. So if f is constant on [c, d], then any y(x) in [c, x] would work, but if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c, sometimes d, but since f is constant on [c,d], then f(y(x)) is still c. So y(x) could be discontinuous on [c, d]. For example, define y(x) = c for rational x in [c,d], and y(x) = d for irrational x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous on [c,d], but on [a,c), y(x)=x, which is continuous. So overall, y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence y is a discontinuous function. Therefore, this would work.

Wait, but when x is in [c,d], y(x) must lie in [a,x], but c ≤ x ≤ d, so if we choose y(x) = c or d, as long as c and d are ≤ x. Wait, but d is greater than c, and x is in [c,d]. So for x in [c,d], if we choose y(x) = d, then d must be ≤ x, but x ≤ d. So y(x)=d only works when x=d. So if x is in [c,d), then d is not ≤ x, so y(x) can&#x27;t be d. Therefore, in this case, if f is constant on [c,d], then for x in [c,d], y(x) must be a point in [a,x] where f(y(x))=c. Since f is c on [c,d], then y(x) can be any point in [c,x], since f(y(x))=c. So if we set y(x) = x for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s continuous. But if we choose y(x) to be c for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s also continuous. But if we set y(x) to sometimes be c and sometimes be other points in [c,x] in a discontinuous way.

For example, let’s define y(x) = c if x is rational, and y(x) = x if x is irrational, for x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous because in any neighborhood of a rational point, there are irrationals where y takes the value x, which approaches the rational point, so the limit would be the rational point, but y at the rational point is c, which is different unless c equals the rational point. Wait, c is a fixed point. Wait, if c is the left endpoint of the interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], if we define y(x) = c for x rational and y(x)=x for x irrational, then at any rational point x0 in [c,d], the function y(x) at x0 is c, but the limit as x approaches x0 from irrationals would be x0, which is not equal to c unless x0 = c. So at x=c, y is continuous because approaching from the right (if c &lt; d), y(x) approaches c (since irrationals approach c, but y(x)=x approaches c, and y(c)=c). But at any x0 &gt; c in [c,d], if x0 is rational, then y(x0)=c, but the limit from the irrationals is x0 ≠ c. So y is discontinuous at every rational point in (c,d]. Similarly, at irrational points x0, y is continuous because approaching from rationals, y approaches c, but y(x0)=x0. Unless c = x0, which only occurs at x0=c. Therefore, y is discontinuous at all rational points in (c,d]. Hence, y is discontinuous on a dense subset of [c,d], hence y is discontinuous everywhere on [c,d] except possibly at c.

Therefore, this y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence discontinuous overall. Therefore, even with a non-constant f (since f increases on [a,c] and is constant on [c,d], then decreases on [d,b]), we can construct a discontinuous y.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. So whether f is constant or not, we can have a discontinuous y. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But to make sure, let me think of another example. Suppose f is a sine wave on [0, 2π], continuous of course. The supremum on [0,x] would be 1 once x reaches π/2, since sin(π/2)=1, and then after that, the supremum remains 1. So for x ≥ π/2, y(x) must be π/2. For x &lt; π/2, y(x) must be x, since sin(x) is increasing on [0, π/2]. Therefore, y(x) is x for x ∈ [0, π/2] and π/2 for x ∈ [π/2, 2π]. This y is continuous, since at π/2, the left limit is π/2 and the right limit is π/2. So y is continuous here. But if we modify y(x) for x ≥ π/2 to sometimes be π/2 and sometimes other points where f is 1. Wait, but after π/2, the maximum is always 1, which is achieved at π/2 and also at 3π/2, but wait, sin(3π/2) is -1, which is not the supremum. Wait, no, on [0, x], for x ≥ π/2, the supremum is 1, achieved only at π/2. Because after π/2, sin decreases to 0 at π, then negative values, so the maximum remains 1. So y(x) must be π/2 for x ≥ π/2. Therefore, y(x) is forced to be π/2 there, hence continuous. So in this case, even with a non-constant f, y is continuous.

So in some cases, even if f is non-constant, y has to be continuous. But in other cases, like when f has a flat part, we can make y discontinuous. Therefore, the existence depends on the function f. But the problem asks whether there exists any continuous f and discontinuous y such that the equation holds. So as long as there is at least one such pair, the answer is yes. Since we have examples where f is constant or has flat parts allowing y to be discontinuous, the answer is yes.

Another angle: suppose f is such that its maximum on [a,x] is not uniquely attained. Then y(x) can choose any maximum point, and by choosing different points in a discontinuous way, y can be made discontinuous. However, for continuous f, the set of maximum points on [a,x] is a closed set, and if the maximum is not unique, it&#x27;s a closed interval. So for example, if f is constant on some interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], the maximum is attained on [c,x], which includes [c,x], so if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c and sometimes x in a discontinuous way, then y would be discontinuous.

But in order for the maximum not to be unique, f needs to be constant on some interval. If f is strictly increasing, then the maximum is unique (at x), so y(x) must be x. If f is non-strictly increasing, like with a flat part, then the maximum is not unique on that flat part.

Therefore, to have a discontinuous y, f must be non-strictly monotonic or have intervals where it&#x27;s constant. Therefore, such f exists, and for those f, we can construct discontinuous y. Hence, the answer is yes.

So, in summary, yes, such functions exist. For example, take f to be constant on [a,b], then any discontinuous y(x) ∈ [a,x] works. Or take f to have a flat part where y can be discontinuous, while keeping f continuous.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether there exists a continuous function \( f \) and a discontinuous function \( y \) such that the equation \(\sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) = f(y(x))\) holds for all \( x \in I = [a, b] \), we analyze the following key points:

1. **Supremum and Maximum**: For a continuous function \( f \) on a closed interval \([a, x]\), the supremum is attained as the maximum value. Therefore, there exists some \( y(x) \in [a, x] \) such that \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

2. **Constant Function Example**: If \( f \) is a constant function, then \( f(y(x)) \) will always equal the constant value for any \( y(x) \in [a, x] \). In this case, \( y(x) \) can be any function, including a discontinuous one. For example, \( y(x) \) could be defined as \( a \) for rational \( x \) and \( x \) for irrational \( x \), resulting in a discontinuous \( y \).

3. **Non-Constant Function Example**: For non-constant continuous functions \( f \) with intervals where \( f \) is constant or has flat parts, \( y(x) \) can be discontinuous on those intervals. For instance, if \( f \) is constant on a subinterval \([c, d]\), \( y(x) \) can jump between different points in \([a, x]\) while still satisfying \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

4. **Verification**: Even if \( f \) is non-constant, as long as there are intervals where the maximum is not uniquely attained (e.g., flat parts), \( y(x) \) can be chosen discontinuously. For example, defining \( y(x) \) to jump between endpoints of the flat part in a discontinuous manner.

Thus, there exist continuous functions \( f \) and discontinuous functions \( y \) that satisfy the given equation. Examples include constant functions with discontinuous \( y \) and non-constant functions with flat parts allowing discontinuous \( y \).

So if we have f constant on some subinterval, say [a, c], and non-constant on [c, b], then on [a, c], y can be discontinuous, and on [c, b], y has to be continuous. So overall y is discontinuous.

Then on [a, c], y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so we can choose y(x) to jump around, like sometimes a, sometimes x, creating discontinuities. Then on [c, b], y(x) must be x. So overall, y would be discontinuous on [a, c] and continuous on [c, b]. But as long as there is at least one point of discontinuity, y is a discontinuous function. So such a function y exists.

But does this satisfy the equation? For x in [a, c], sup f(t) is the constant value, and y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so as long as f is constant on [a, c], f(y(x)) will equal the sup. For x in [c, b], sup f(t) is f(x) since f is increasing there, so y(x) must be x. So if we define y(x) to be, say, a for x in [a, c), and x for x in [c, b], then y is discontinuous at c (since left limit is a, right limit is c, and y(c) = c). So that&#x27;s a discontinuity at c. So this y is discontinuous, and f is continuous (constant on [a, c], increasing on [c, b]). Therefore, this would satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe even simpler: take f to be constant on the entire interval [a, b]. Then y can be any function from [a, b] to [a, b], as long as y(x) is in [a, x]. For example, define y(x) = a for all x except at some point, say x = c, where y(c) = c. Then y is discontinuous at c if we define it that way. Since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the constant value, which equals the sup. So in this case, y is discontinuous (has a jump at c) and f is continuous.

Therefore, such functions do exist. So the answer is yes.

Wait, but the problem says &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So if we can construct even one example where f is continuous and y is discontinuous (even if y is only discontinuous at one point), then the answer is yes. So in the case where f is constant, y can be discontinuous. So yes, such functions exist. So I think the answer is yes, and the example is f constant and y any discontinuous function picking points in [a,x]. But let me verify that.

Suppose f(x) = 1 for all x in [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = 1 for any x. Then we need f(y(x)) = 1, which is true for any y(x) ∈ [a,x] since f(y(x)) =1. So we can choose y(x) to be, for example, a if x is rational, and x if x is irrational. Then y is discontinuous everywhere except possibly at x=a, so y is discontinuous. Therefore, such a function y exists. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But maybe the problem is intended to have f non-constant? Let me check the original problem again. It just says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So even if f is constant, as long as y is discontinuous, that&#x27;s acceptable. Therefore, such a pair exists, so the answer is yes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trickier. Suppose f is not constant. Then can we still have a discontinuous y?

Suppose f is a non-constant continuous function. For example, f(x) = x on [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = f(x) = x. So y(x) must be x. Therefore, y is continuous. So in this case, y must be continuous.

But if f is a non-constant function that attains its maximum at varying points, maybe y can be discontinuous. Wait, but for continuous f, the maximum is attained, and the set of maximum points is a closed set. For example, suppose f is a function that has multiple maxima on some intervals. Wait, but if f is continuous, the set where f attains its maximum on [a,x] could be a single point or multiple points.

Wait, suppose f is such that on some subintervals, the maximum is attained at multiple points. For example, f is a constant on some subintervals. Wait, but even then, if we have to choose y(x) as one of those points, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, then on those parts y(x) has to be continuous.

Wait, maybe f could be a function that has plateaus. For example, f(x) is increasing up to some point, then constant, then decreasing. Then on the increasing part, y(x) =x, on the constant part, y(x) can be any point in [a,x], so we could choose to make y discontinuous there, and on the decreasing part, y(x) must be the point where the plateau is. So overall, y could have discontinuities in the constant part.

But if the problem allows y to be discontinuous only on parts where f is constant, but continuous elsewhere, then overall y is discontinuous. But f is still continuous.

But in this case, even though f is non-constant (since it&#x27;s increasing and decreasing), but with a flat part, we can have a y that&#x27;s discontinuous on the flat part.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. For example, take f(x) = x on [a, c], f(x) = c on [c, d], and f(x) = d - x on [d, b], where a &lt; c &lt; d &lt; b. Then on [a, c], sup f(t) on [a,x] is f(x) =x, so y(x) =x. On [c, d], sup f(t) is f(c) = c, so y(x) can be any point in [a,x] that maps to c. Since c is in [a,x] for x ≥ c, we can choose y(x) = c for x in [c, d]. On [d, b], sup f(t) is still c, so y(x) must be c. Therefore, y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So overall, y(x) is x for x in [a,c), and c for x in [c, b]. This function y(x) is continuous on [a,c) and constant on [c,b], but at x=c, the left limit is c (since approaching from the left, y approaches c), and y(c)=c. So actually, y is continuous at c as well. Wait, no. Wait, for x approaching c from the left, y(x) approaches c, and y(c) = c. So y is continuous at c. Therefore, y is continuous everywhere. So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, so maybe even with a flat part, if we try to make y discontinuous, the requirement that sup f(t) = f(y(x)) forces y(x) to be c for x ≥ c. So y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So if we set y(x) = c for x ≥ c, that&#x27;s continuous. But if we tried to make y(x) jump around in the flat part, but since the sup is still c, y(x) has to be a point where f(y(x))=c. So if f is constant on [c, d], then any y(x) in [c, x] would work, but if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c, sometimes d, but since f is constant on [c,d], then f(y(x)) is still c. So y(x) could be discontinuous on [c, d]. For example, define y(x) = c for rational x in [c,d], and y(x) = d for irrational x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous on [c,d], but on [a,c), y(x)=x, which is continuous. So overall, y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence y is a discontinuous function. Therefore, this would work.

Wait, but when x is in [c,d], y(x) must lie in [a,x], but c ≤ x ≤ d, so if we choose y(x) = c or d, as long as c and d are ≤ x. Wait, but d is greater than c, and x is in [c,d]. So for x in [c,d], if we choose y(x) = d, then d must be ≤ x, but x ≤ d. So y(x)=d only works when x=d. So if x is in [c,d), then d is not ≤ x, so y(x) can&#x27;t be d. Therefore, in this case, if f is constant on [c,d], then for x in [c,d], y(x) must be a point in [a,x] where f(y(x))=c. Since f is c on [c,d], then y(x) can be any point in [c,x], since f(y(x))=c. So if we set y(x) = x for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s continuous. But if we choose y(x) to be c for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s also continuous. But if we set y(x) to sometimes be c and sometimes be other points in [c,x] in a discontinuous way.

For example, let’s define y(x) = c if x is rational, and y(x) = x if x is irrational, for x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous because in any neighborhood of a rational point, there are irrationals where y takes the value x, which approaches the rational point, so the limit would be the rational point, but y at the rational point is c, which is different unless c equals the rational point. Wait, c is a fixed point. Wait, if c is the left endpoint of the interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], if we define y(x) = c for x rational and y(x)=x for x irrational, then at any rational point x0 in [c,d], the function y(x) at x0 is c, but the limit as x approaches x0 from irrationals would be x0, which is not equal to c unless x0 = c. So at x=c, y is continuous because approaching from the right (if c &lt; d), y(x) approaches c (since irrationals approach c, but y(x)=x approaches c, and y(c)=c). But at any x0 &gt; c in [c,d], if x0 is rational, then y(x0)=c, but the limit from the irrationals is x0 ≠ c. So y is discontinuous at every rational point in (c,d]. Similarly, at irrational points x0, y is continuous because approaching from rationals, y approaches c, but y(x0)=x0. Unless c = x0, which only occurs at x0=c. Therefore, y is discontinuous at all rational points in (c,d]. Hence, y is discontinuous on a dense subset of [c,d], hence y is discontinuous everywhere on [c,d] except possibly at c.

Therefore, this y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence discontinuous overall. Therefore, even with a non-constant f (since f increases on [a,c] and is constant on [c,d], then decreases on [d,b]), we can construct a discontinuous y.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. So whether f is constant or not, we can have a discontinuous y. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But to make sure, let me think of another example. Suppose f is a sine wave on [0, 2π], continuous of course. The supremum on [0,x] would be 1 once x reaches π/2, since sin(π/2)=1, and then after that, the supremum remains 1. So for x ≥ π/2, y(x) must be π/2. For x &lt; π/2, y(x) must be x, since sin(x) is increasing on [0, π/2]. Therefore, y(x) is x for x ∈ [0, π/2] and π/2 for x ∈ [π/2, 2π]. This y is continuous, since at π/2, the left limit is π/2 and the right limit is π/2. So y is continuous here. But if we modify y(x) for x ≥ π/2 to sometimes be π/2 and sometimes other points where f is 1. Wait, but after π/2, the maximum is always 1, which is achieved at π/2 and also at 3π/2, but wait, sin(3π/2) is -1, which is not the supremum. Wait, no, on [0, x], for x ≥ π/2, the supremum is 1, achieved only at π/2. Because after π/2, sin decreases to 0 at π, then negative values, so the maximum remains 1. So y(x) must be π/2 for x ≥ π/2. Therefore, y(x) is forced to be π/2 there, hence continuous. So in this case, even with a non-constant f, y is continuous.

So in some cases, even if f is non-constant, y has to be continuous. But in other cases, like when f has a flat part, we can make y discontinuous. Therefore, the existence depends on the function f. But the problem asks whether there exists any continuous f and discontinuous y such that the equation holds. So as long as there is at least one such pair, the answer is yes. Since we have examples where f is constant or has flat parts allowing y to be discontinuous, the answer is yes.

Another angle: suppose f is such that its maximum on [a,x] is not uniquely attained. Then y(x) can choose any maximum point, and by choosing different points in a discontinuous way, y can be made discontinuous. However, for continuous f, the set of maximum points on [a,x] is a closed set, and if the maximum is not unique, it&#x27;s a closed interval. So for example, if f is constant on some interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], the maximum is attained on [c,x], which includes [c,x], so if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c and sometimes x in a discontinuous way, then y would be discontinuous.

But in order for the maximum not to be unique, f needs to be constant on some interval. If f is strictly increasing, then the maximum is unique (at x), so y(x) must be x. If f is non-strictly increasing, like with a flat part, then the maximum is not unique on that flat part.

Therefore, to have a discontinuous y, f must be non-strictly monotonic or have intervals where it&#x27;s constant. Therefore, such f exists, and for those f, we can construct discontinuous y. Hence, the answer is yes.

So, in summary, yes, such functions exist. For example, take f to be constant on [a,b], then any discontinuous y(x) ∈ [a,x] works. Or take f to have a flat part where y can be discontinuous, while keeping f continuous.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether there exists a continuous function \( f \) and a discontinuous function \( y \) such that the equation \(\sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) = f(y(x))\) holds for all \( x \in I = [a, b] \), we analyze the following key points:

1. **Supremum and Maximum**: For a continuous function \( f \) on a closed interval \([a, x]\), the supremum is attained as the maximum value. Therefore, there exists some \( y(x) \in [a, x] \) such that \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

2. **Constant Function Example**: If \( f \) is a constant function, then \( f(y(x)) \) will always equal the constant value for any \( y(x) \in [a, x] \). In this case, \( y(x) \) can be any function, including a discontinuous one. For example, \( y(x) \) could be defined as \( a \) for rational \( x \) and \( x \) for irrational \( x \), resulting in a discontinuous \( y \).

3. **Non-Constant Function Example**: For non-constant continuous functions \( f \) with intervals where \( f \) is constant or has flat parts, \( y(x) \) can be discontinuous on those intervals. For instance, if \( f \) is constant on a subinterval \([c, d]\), \( y(x) \) can jump between different points in \([a, x]\) while still satisfying \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

4. **Verification**: Even if \( f \) is non-constant, as long as there are intervals where the maximum is not uniquely attained (e.g., flat parts), \( y(x) \) can be chosen discontinuously. For example, defining \( y(x) \) to jump between endpoints of the flat part in a discontinuous manner.

Thus, there exist continuous functions \( f \) and discontinuous functions \( y \) that satisfy the given equation. Examples include constant functions with discontinuous \( y \) and non-constant functions with flat parts allowing discontinuous \( y \).

Problem: Determine whether there exists a continuous function $f$ and a discontinuous function $y$ such that the equation $\sup_{t \in [a,x]}f(t) = f(y(x))$ holds for all $x \in I$, where $I=[a,b]$ is a closed real interval. Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>

Response: Yes, take $I=[0,2]$ and let $f$ be the constant function $f(x) = 6$. For any $0 \leq x \leq 2$, we have $f(t) = 6, \forall t \in [0,x]$, so $f(x)=6$. However, we can use a constant function $y=4$ to get $f(y(2))=6$ without going through any point of $[0,2]$; so $\sup_{t\in [0,2]}f(t) \neq f(y(2))$. \boxed{Yes}          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if there&#x27;s a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y such that for every x in the interval [a,b], the supremum of f on [a,x] is equal to f(y(x)). Hmm, interesting. Let me break this down.

First, the supremum of f on [a,x] is just the maximum value of f on that interval since f is continuous on a closed interval, right? Because continuous functions on compact intervals attain their maximum and minimum. So, sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = max_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t). Therefore, there must be some point y(x) in [a,x] where f(y(x)) is equal to this maximum.

So y(x) is a function that picks out a point in [a,x] where f attains its maximum. The question is whether y can be discontinuous while f is continuous.

Let me think of some examples. Suppose f is a constant function. Then every point in [a,x] is a maximum, so y(x) could be any function from I to [a,x]. But since f is constant, even if y is discontinuous, f(y(x)) would still be constant, which matches the supremum. However, the problem states that y should be discontinuous. If f is constant, then y could be discontinuous, but maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that f has to be non-constant. So technically, yes, if f is constant, then y can be any function, including a discontinuous one. But maybe the problem is more interesting if f is non-constant. Let me check the problem statement again.

It says &quot;a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y&quot;. So it doesn&#x27;t specify that f must be non-constant, so maybe the answer is yes, and the example is a constant function f and any discontinuous y. But wait, if f is constant, then f(y(x)) is constant, which equals the supremum, which is also constant. So in that case, y can be any function, even a discontinuous one. So this would satisfy the equation. So in this case, such functions exist. But maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So as long as there exists any continuous f (could be constant) and some discontinuous y that works. Since in the case of constant f, y can be discontinuous, then the answer would be yes. But maybe the problem is intended to consider non-constant f? Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe even for non-constant f, can we have a discontinuous y? Let&#x27;s consider a non-constant f. Suppose f is increasing. Then the supremum on [a,x] is f(x), so y(x) must equal x. Then y is continuous, so that&#x27;s not helpful. If f is decreasing, then the supremum on [a,x] is f(a), so y(x) must be a for all x. But then y is constant, hence continuous. So in these cases, y is forced to be continuous.

What if f has a maximum somewhere in the middle? For example, suppose f is a function that increases up to some point c in [a,b] and then decreases. Then the supremum on [a,x] for x ≤ c would be f(x), and for x ≥ c, it would be f(c). So in that case, for x ≥ c, y(x) must be c. But for x &lt; c, y(x) must be x. So y(x) would be x for x &lt; c and c for x ≥ c. Is this function y discontinuous?

At x = c, left limit of y(x) as x approaches c from below is c, and the right limit is c, and y(c) = c, so it&#x27;s continuous at c. So y is continuous here. So even if f has a peak, y is still continuous.

Wait, but what if the maximum is not unique? For example, suppose f is constant on some interval. If f is constant on [a, d] for some d &gt; a, then any y(x) in [a, x] would work for x ≤ d. But if we choose y(x) to jump around, could that make y discontinuous? For example, suppose f is constant on [a, d], then for x in [a, d], y(x) could be a, then jump to some other point in [a, x], but since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the supremum. So in this case, y could be discontinuous on [a, d], but continuous elsewhere. However, the problem requires y to be discontinuous on the entire interval I = [a, b]. So if we only have y discontinuous on a subinterval, is that acceptable?

Wait, the problem states &quot;for all x ∈ I&quot;, so y needs to be defined on I, and the equation has to hold for all x in I. If f is constant on part of the interval, we can make y discontinuous there, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, y might have to be continuous there. So maybe we can construct an f that&#x27;s constant on some part and non-constant on another, allowing y to be discontinuous on the constant part but continuous on the non-constant part. But then y would not be entirely discontinuous on I. The problem requires y to be discontinuous, not necessarily discontinuous everywhere. So if y has at least one point of discontinuity, it&#x27;s considered discontinuous.

So if we have f constant on some subinterval, say [a, c], and non-constant on [c, b], then on [a, c], y can be discontinuous, and on [c, b], y has to be continuous. So overall y is discontinuous. For example, let f be constant on [a, c] and then increasing on [c, b]. Then on [a, c], y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so we can choose y(x) to jump around, like sometimes a, sometimes x, creating discontinuities. Then on [c, b], y(x) must be x. So overall, y would be discontinuous on [a, c] and continuous on [c, b]. But as long as there is at least one point of discontinuity, y is a discontinuous function. So such a function y exists.

But does this satisfy the equation? For x in [a, c], sup f(t) is the constant value, and y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so as long as f is constant on [a, c], f(y(x)) will equal the sup. For x in [c, b], sup f(t) is f(x) since f is increasing there, so y(x) must be x. So if we define y(x) to be, say, a for x in [a, c), and x for x in [c, b], then y is discontinuous at c (since left limit is a, right limit is c, and y(c) = c). So that&#x27;s a discontinuity at c. So this y is discontinuous, and f is continuous (constant on [a, c], increasing on [c, b]). Therefore, this would satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe even simpler: take f to be constant on the entire interval [a, b]. Then y can be any function from [a, b] to [a, b], as long as y(x) is in [a, x]. For example, define y(x) = a for all x except at some point, say x = c, where y(c) = c. Then y is discontinuous at c if we define it that way. Since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the constant value, which equals the sup. So in this case, y is discontinuous (has a jump at c) and f is continuous.

Therefore, such functions do exist. So the answer is yes.

Wait, but the problem says &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So if we can construct even one example where f is continuous and y is discontinuous (even if y is only discontinuous at one point), then the answer is yes. So in the case where f is constant, y can be discontinuous. So yes, such functions exist. So I think the answer is yes, and the example is f constant and y any discontinuous function picking points in [a,x]. But let me verify that.

Suppose f(x) = 1 for all x in [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = 1 for any x. Then we need f(y(x)) = 1, which is true for any y(x) ∈ [a,x] since f(y(x)) =1. So we can choose y(x) to be, for example, a if x is rational, and x if x is irrational. Then y is discontinuous everywhere except possibly at x=a, so y is discontinuous. Therefore, such a function y exists. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But maybe the problem is intended to have f non-constant? Let me check the original problem again. It just says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So even if f is constant, as long as y is discontinuous, that&#x27;s acceptable. Therefore, such a pair exists, so the answer is yes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trickier. Suppose f is not constant. Then can we still have a discontinuous y?

Suppose f is a non-constant continuous function. For example, f(x) = x on [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = f(x) = x. So y(x) must be x. Therefore, y is continuous. So in this case, y must be continuous.

But if f is a non-constant function that attains its maximum at varying points, maybe y can be discontinuous. Wait, but for continuous f, the maximum is attained, and the set of maximum points is a closed set. For example, suppose f is a function that has multiple maxima on some intervals. Wait, but if f is continuous, the set where f attains its maximum on [a,x] could be a single point or multiple points.

Wait, suppose f is such that on some subintervals, the maximum is attained at multiple points. For example, f is a constant on some subintervals. Wait, but even then, if we have to choose y(x) as one of those points, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, then on those parts y(x) has to be continuous.

Wait, maybe f could be a function that has plateaus. For example, f(x) is increasing up to some point, then constant, then decreasing. Then on the increasing part, y(x) =x, on the constant part, y(x) can be any point in [a,x], so we could choose to make y discontinuous there, and on the decreasing part, y(x) must be the point where the plateau is. So overall, y could have discontinuities in the constant part.

But if the problem allows y to be discontinuous only on parts where f is constant, but continuous elsewhere, then overall y is discontinuous. But f is still continuous.

But in this case, even though f is non-constant (since it&#x27;s increasing and decreasing), but with a flat part, we can have a y that&#x27;s discontinuous on the flat part.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. For example, take f(x) = x on [a, c], f(x) = c on [c, d], and f(x) = d - x on [d, b], where a &lt; c &lt; d &lt; b. Then on [a, c], sup f(t) on [a,x] is f(x) =x, so y(x) =x. On [c, d], sup f(t) is f(c) = c, so y(x) can be any point in [a,x] that maps to c. Since c is in [a,x] for x ≥ c, we can choose y(x) = c for x in [c, d]. On [d, b], sup f(t) is still c, so y(x) must be c. Therefore, y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So overall, y(x) is x for x in [a,c), and c for x in [c, b]. This function y(x) is continuous on [a,c) and constant on [c,b], but at x=c, the left limit is c (since approaching from the left, y approaches c), and y(c)=c. So actually, y is continuous at c as well. Wait, no. Wait, for x approaching c from the left, y(x) approaches c, and y(c) = c. So y is continuous at c. Therefore, y is continuous everywhere. So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, so maybe even with a flat part, if we try to make y discontinuous, the requirement that sup f(t) = f(y(x)) forces y(x) to be c for x ≥ c. So y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So if we set y(x) = c for x ≥ c, that&#x27;s continuous. But if we tried to make y(x) jump around in the flat part, but since the sup is still c, y(x) has to be a point where f(y(x))=c. So if f is constant on [c, d], then any y(x) in [c, x] would work, but if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c, sometimes d, but since f is constant on [c,d], then f(y(x)) is still c. So y(x) could be discontinuous on [c, d]. For example, define y(x) = c for rational x in [c,d], and y(x) = d for irrational x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous on [c,d], but on [a,c), y(x)=x, which is continuous. So overall, y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence y is a discontinuous function. Therefore, this would work.

Wait, but when x is in [c,d], y(x) must lie in [a,x], but c ≤ x ≤ d, so if we choose y(x) = c or d, as long as c and d are ≤ x. Wait, but d is greater than c, and x is in [c,d]. So for x in [c,d], if we choose y(x) = d, then d must be ≤ x, but x ≤ d. So y(x)=d only works when x=d. So if x is in [c,d), then d is not ≤ x, so y(x) can&#x27;t be d. Therefore, in this case, if f is constant on [c,d], then for x in [c,d], y(x) must be a point in [a,x] where f(y(x))=c. Since f is c on [c,d], then y(x) can be any point in [c,x], since f(y(x))=c. So if we set y(x) = x for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s continuous. But if we choose y(x) to be c for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s also continuous. But if we set y(x) to sometimes be c and sometimes be other points in [c,x] in a discontinuous way.

For example, let’s define y(x) = c if x is rational, and y(x) = x if x is irrational, for x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous because in any neighborhood of a rational point, there are irrationals where y takes the value x, which approaches the rational point, so the limit would be the rational point, but y at the rational point is c, which is different unless c equals the rational point. Wait, c is a fixed point. Wait, if c is the left endpoint of the interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], if we define y(x) = c for x rational and y(x)=x for x irrational, then at any rational point x0 in [c,d], the function y(x) at x0 is c, but the limit as x approaches x0 from irrationals would be x0, which is not equal to c unless x0 = c. So at x=c, y is continuous because approaching from the right (if c &lt; d), y(x) approaches c (since irrationals approach c, but y(x)=x approaches c, and y(c)=c). But at any x0 &gt; c in [c,d], if x0 is rational, then y(x0)=c, but the limit from the irrationals is x0 ≠ c. So y is discontinuous at every rational point in (c,d]. Similarly, at irrational points x0, y is continuous because approaching from rationals, y approaches c, but y(x0)=x0. Unless c = x0, which only occurs at x0=c. Therefore, y is discontinuous at all rational points in (c,d]. Hence, y is discontinuous on a dense subset of [c,d], hence y is discontinuous everywhere on [c,d] except possibly at c.

Therefore, this y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence discontinuous overall. Therefore, even with a non-constant f (since f increases on [a,c] and is constant on [c,d], then decreases on [d,b]), we can construct a discontinuous y.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. So whether f is constant or not, we can have a discontinuous y. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But to make sure, let me think of another example. Suppose f is a sine wave on [0, 2π], continuous of course. The supremum on [0,x] would be 1 once x reaches π/2, since sin(π/2)=1, and then after that, the supremum remains 1. So for x ≥ π/2, y(x) must be π/2. For x &lt; π/2, y(x) must be x, since sin(x) is increasing on [0, π/2]. Therefore, y(x) is x for x ∈ [0, π/2] and π/2 for x ∈ [π/2, 2π]. This y is continuous, since at π/2, the left limit is π/2 and the right limit is π/2. So y is continuous here. But if we modify y(x) for x ≥ π/2 to sometimes be π/2 and sometimes other points where f is 1. Wait, but after π/2, the maximum is always 1, which is achieved at π/2 and also at 3π/2, but wait, sin(3π/2) is -1, which is not the supremum. Wait, no, on [0, x], for x ≥ π/2, the supremum is 1, achieved only at π/2. Because after π/2, sin decreases to 0 at π, then negative values, so the maximum remains 1. So y(x) must be π/2 for x ≥ π/2. Therefore, y(x) is forced to be π/2 there, hence continuous. So in this case, even with a non-constant f, y is continuous.

So in some cases, even if f is non-constant, y has to be continuous. But in other cases, like when f has a flat part, we can make y discontinuous. Therefore, the existence depends on the function f. But the problem asks whether there exists any continuous f and discontinuous y such that the equation holds. So as long as there is at least one such pair, the answer is yes. Since we have examples where f is constant or has flat parts allowing y to be discontinuous, the answer is yes.

Another angle: suppose f is such that its maximum on [a,x] is not uniquely attained. Then y(x) can choose any maximum point, and by choosing different points in a discontinuous way, y can be made discontinuous. However, for continuous f, the set of maximum points on [a,x] is a closed set, and if the maximum is not unique, it&#x27;s a closed interval. So for example, if f is constant on some interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], the maximum is attained on [c,x], which includes [c,x], so if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c and sometimes x in a discontinuous way, then y would be discontinuous.

But in order for the maximum not to be unique, f needs to be constant on some interval. If f is strictly increasing, then the maximum is unique (at x), so y(x) must be x. If f is non-strictly increasing, like with a flat part, then the maximum is not unique on that flat part.

Therefore, to have a discontinuous y, f must be non-strictly monotonic or have intervals where it&#x27;s constant. Therefore, such f exists, and for those f, we can construct discontinuous y. Hence, the answer is yes.

So, in summary, yes, such functions exist. For example, take f to be constant on [a,b], then any discontinuous y(x) ∈ [a,x] works. Or take f to have a flat part where y can be discontinuous, while keeping f continuous.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether there exists a continuous function \( f \) and a discontinuous function \( y \) such that the equation \(\sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) = f(y(x))\) holds for all \( x \in I = [a, b] \), we analyze the following key points:

1. **Supremum and Maximum**: For a continuous function \( f \) on a closed interval \([a, x]\), the supremum is attained as the maximum value. Therefore, there exists some \( y(x) \in [a, x] \) such that \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

2. **Constant Function Example**: If \( f \) is a constant function, then \( f(y(x)) \) will always equal the constant value for any \( y(x) \in [a, x] \). In this case, \( y(x) \) can be any function, including a discontinuous one. For example, \( y(x) \) could be defined as \( a \) for rational \( x \) and \( x \) for irrational \( x \), resulting in a discontinuous \( y \).

3. **Non-Constant Function Example**: For non-constant continuous functions \( f \) with intervals where \( f \) is constant or has flat parts, \( y(x) \) can be discontinuous on those intervals. For instance, if \( f \) is constant on a subinterval \([c, d]\), \( y(x) \) can jump between different points in \([a, x]\) while still satisfying \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

4. **Verification**: Even if \( f \) is non-constant, as long as there are intervals where the maximum is not uniquely attained (e.g., flat parts), \( y(x) \) can be chosen discontinuously. For example, defining \( y(x) \) to jump between endpoints of the flat part in a discontinuous manner.

Thus, there exist continuous functions \( f \) and discontinuous functions \( y \) that satisfy the given equation. Examples include constant functions with discontinuous \( y \) and non-constant functions with flat parts allowing discontinuous \( y \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if there&#x27;s a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y such that for every x in the interval [a,b], the supremum of f on [a,x] is equal to f(y(x)). Hmm, interesting. Let me break this down.

First, the supremum of f on [a,x] is just the maximum value of f on that interval since f is continuous on a closed interval, right? Because continuous functions on compact intervals attain their maximum and minimum. So, sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = max_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t). Therefore, there must be some point y(x) in [a,x] where f(y(x)) is equal to this maximum.

So y(x) is a function that picks out a point in [a,x] where f attains its maximum. The question is whether y can be discontinuous while f is continuous.

Let me think of some examples. Suppose f is a constant function. Then every point in [a,x] is a maximum, so y(x) could be any function from I to [a,x]. But since f is constant, even if y is discontinuous, f(y(x)) would still be constant, which matches the supremum. However, the problem states that y should be discontinuous. If f is constant, then y could be discontinuous, but maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that f has to be non-constant. So technically, yes, if f is constant, then y can be any function, including a discontinuous one. But maybe the problem is more interesting if f is non-constant. Let me check the problem statement again.

It says &quot;a continuous function f and a discontinuous function y&quot;. So it doesn&#x27;t specify that f must be non-constant, so maybe the answer is yes, and the example is a constant function f and any discontinuous y. But wait, if f is constant, then f(y(x)) is constant, which equals the supremum, which is also constant. So in that case, y can be any function, even a discontinuous one. So this would satisfy the equation. So in this case, such functions exist. But maybe the problem wants f to be non-constant? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So as long as there exists any continuous f (could be constant) and some discontinuous y that works. Since in the case of constant f, y can be discontinuous, then the answer would be yes. But maybe the problem is intended to consider non-constant f? Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe even for non-constant f, can we have a discontinuous y? Let&#x27;s consider a non-constant f. Suppose f is increasing. Then the supremum on [a,x] is f(x), so y(x) must equal x. Then y is continuous, so that&#x27;s not helpful. If f is decreasing, then the supremum on [a,x] is f(a), so y(x) must be a for all x. But then y is constant, hence continuous. So in these cases, y is forced to be continuous.

What if f has a maximum somewhere in the middle? For example, suppose f is a function that increases up to some point c in [a,b] and then decreases. Then the supremum on [a,x] for x ≤ c would be f(x), and for x ≥ c, it would be f(c). So in that case, for x ≥ c, y(x) must be c. But for x &lt; c, y(x) must be x. So y(x) would be x for x &lt; c and c for x ≥ c. Is this function y discontinuous?

At x = c, left limit of y(x) as x approaches c from below is c, and the right limit is c, and y(c) = c, so it&#x27;s continuous at c. So y is continuous here. So even if f has a peak, y is still continuous.

Wait, but what if the maximum is not unique? For example, suppose f is constant on some interval. If f is constant on [a, d] for some d &gt; a, then any y(x) in [a, x] would work for x ≤ d. But if we choose y(x) to jump around, could that make y discontinuous? For example, suppose f is constant on [a, d], then for x in [a, d], y(x) could be a, then jump to some other point in [a, x], but since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the supremum. So in this case, y could be discontinuous on [a, d], but continuous elsewhere. However, the problem requires y to be discontinuous on the entire interval I = [a, b]. So if we only have y discontinuous on a subinterval, is that acceptable?

Wait, the problem states &quot;for all x ∈ I&quot;, so y needs to be defined on I, and the equation has to hold for all x in I. If f is constant on part of the interval, we can make y discontinuous there, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, y might have to be continuous there. So maybe we can construct an f that&#x27;s constant on some part and non-constant on another, allowing y to be discontinuous on the constant part but continuous on the non-constant part. But then y would not be entirely discontinuous on I. The problem requires y to be discontinuous, not necessarily discontinuous everywhere. So if y has at least one point of discontinuity, it&#x27;s considered discontinuous.

So if we have f constant on some subinterval, say [a, c], and non-constant on [c, b], then on [a, c], y can be discontinuous, and on [c, b], y has to be continuous. So overall y is discontinuous. For example, let f be constant on [a, c] and then increasing on [c, b]. Then on [a, c], y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so we can choose y(x) to jump around, like sometimes a, sometimes x, creating discontinuities. Then on [c, b], y(x) must be x. So overall, y would be discontinuous on [a, c] and continuous on [c, b]. But as long as there is at least one point of discontinuity, y is a discontinuous function. So such a function y exists.

But does this satisfy the equation? For x in [a, c], sup f(t) is the constant value, and y(x) can be any point in [a, x], so as long as f is constant on [a, c], f(y(x)) will equal the sup. For x in [c, b], sup f(t) is f(x) since f is increasing there, so y(x) must be x. So if we define y(x) to be, say, a for x in [a, c), and x for x in [c, b], then y is discontinuous at c (since left limit is a, right limit is c, and y(c) = c). So that&#x27;s a discontinuity at c. So this y is discontinuous, and f is continuous (constant on [a, c], increasing on [c, b]). Therefore, this would satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, maybe even simpler: take f to be constant on the entire interval [a, b]. Then y can be any function from [a, b] to [a, b], as long as y(x) is in [a, x]. For example, define y(x) = a for all x except at some point, say x = c, where y(c) = c. Then y is discontinuous at c if we define it that way. Since f is constant, f(y(x)) is still the constant value, which equals the sup. So in this case, y is discontinuous (has a jump at c) and f is continuous.

Therefore, such functions do exist. So the answer is yes.

Wait, but the problem says &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So if we can construct even one example where f is continuous and y is discontinuous (even if y is only discontinuous at one point), then the answer is yes. So in the case where f is constant, y can be discontinuous. So yes, such functions exist. So I think the answer is yes, and the example is f constant and y any discontinuous function picking points in [a,x]. But let me verify that.

Suppose f(x) = 1 for all x in [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = 1 for any x. Then we need f(y(x)) = 1, which is true for any y(x) ∈ [a,x] since f(y(x)) =1. So we can choose y(x) to be, for example, a if x is rational, and x if x is irrational. Then y is discontinuous everywhere except possibly at x=a, so y is discontinuous. Therefore, such a function y exists. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But maybe the problem is intended to have f non-constant? Let me check the original problem again. It just says &quot;a continuous function f&quot; and &quot;a discontinuous function y&quot;. So even if f is constant, as long as y is discontinuous, that&#x27;s acceptable. Therefore, such a pair exists, so the answer is yes.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trickier. Suppose f is not constant. Then can we still have a discontinuous y?

Suppose f is a non-constant continuous function. For example, f(x) = x on [a,b]. Then sup_{t ∈ [a,x]} f(t) = f(x) = x. So y(x) must be x. Therefore, y is continuous. So in this case, y must be continuous.

But if f is a non-constant function that attains its maximum at varying points, maybe y can be discontinuous. Wait, but for continuous f, the maximum is attained, and the set of maximum points is a closed set. For example, suppose f is a function that has multiple maxima on some intervals. Wait, but if f is continuous, the set where f attains its maximum on [a,x] could be a single point or multiple points.

Wait, suppose f is such that on some subintervals, the maximum is attained at multiple points. For example, f is a constant on some subintervals. Wait, but even then, if we have to choose y(x) as one of those points, but if f is non-constant elsewhere, then on those parts y(x) has to be continuous.

Wait, maybe f could be a function that has plateaus. For example, f(x) is increasing up to some point, then constant, then decreasing. Then on the increasing part, y(x) =x, on the constant part, y(x) can be any point in [a,x], so we could choose to make y discontinuous there, and on the decreasing part, y(x) must be the point where the plateau is. So overall, y could have discontinuities in the constant part.

But if the problem allows y to be discontinuous only on parts where f is constant, but continuous elsewhere, then overall y is discontinuous. But f is still continuous.

But in this case, even though f is non-constant (since it&#x27;s increasing and decreasing), but with a flat part, we can have a y that&#x27;s discontinuous on the flat part.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. For example, take f(x) = x on [a, c], f(x) = c on [c, d], and f(x) = d - x on [d, b], where a &lt; c &lt; d &lt; b. Then on [a, c], sup f(t) on [a,x] is f(x) =x, so y(x) =x. On [c, d], sup f(t) is f(c) = c, so y(x) can be any point in [a,x] that maps to c. Since c is in [a,x] for x ≥ c, we can choose y(x) = c for x in [c, d]. On [d, b], sup f(t) is still c, so y(x) must be c. Therefore, y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So overall, y(x) is x for x in [a,c), and c for x in [c, b]. This function y(x) is continuous on [a,c) and constant on [c,b], but at x=c, the left limit is c (since approaching from the left, y approaches c), and y(c)=c. So actually, y is continuous at c as well. Wait, no. Wait, for x approaching c from the left, y(x) approaches c, and y(c) = c. So y is continuous at c. Therefore, y is continuous everywhere. So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, so maybe even with a flat part, if we try to make y discontinuous, the requirement that sup f(t) = f(y(x)) forces y(x) to be c for x ≥ c. So y(x) is c for x ≥ c. So if we set y(x) = c for x ≥ c, that&#x27;s continuous. But if we tried to make y(x) jump around in the flat part, but since the sup is still c, y(x) has to be a point where f(y(x))=c. So if f is constant on [c, d], then any y(x) in [c, x] would work, but if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c, sometimes d, but since f is constant on [c,d], then f(y(x)) is still c. So y(x) could be discontinuous on [c, d]. For example, define y(x) = c for rational x in [c,d], and y(x) = d for irrational x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous on [c,d], but on [a,c), y(x)=x, which is continuous. So overall, y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence y is a discontinuous function. Therefore, this would work.

Wait, but when x is in [c,d], y(x) must lie in [a,x], but c ≤ x ≤ d, so if we choose y(x) = c or d, as long as c and d are ≤ x. Wait, but d is greater than c, and x is in [c,d]. So for x in [c,d], if we choose y(x) = d, then d must be ≤ x, but x ≤ d. So y(x)=d only works when x=d. So if x is in [c,d), then d is not ≤ x, so y(x) can&#x27;t be d. Therefore, in this case, if f is constant on [c,d], then for x in [c,d], y(x) must be a point in [a,x] where f(y(x))=c. Since f is c on [c,d], then y(x) can be any point in [c,x], since f(y(x))=c. So if we set y(x) = x for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s continuous. But if we choose y(x) to be c for x in [c,d], that&#x27;s also continuous. But if we set y(x) to sometimes be c and sometimes be other points in [c,x] in a discontinuous way.

For example, let’s define y(x) = c if x is rational, and y(x) = x if x is irrational, for x in [c,d]. Then y is discontinuous because in any neighborhood of a rational point, there are irrationals where y takes the value x, which approaches the rational point, so the limit would be the rational point, but y at the rational point is c, which is different unless c equals the rational point. Wait, c is a fixed point. Wait, if c is the left endpoint of the interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], if we define y(x) = c for x rational and y(x)=x for x irrational, then at any rational point x0 in [c,d], the function y(x) at x0 is c, but the limit as x approaches x0 from irrationals would be x0, which is not equal to c unless x0 = c. So at x=c, y is continuous because approaching from the right (if c &lt; d), y(x) approaches c (since irrationals approach c, but y(x)=x approaches c, and y(c)=c). But at any x0 &gt; c in [c,d], if x0 is rational, then y(x0)=c, but the limit from the irrationals is x0 ≠ c. So y is discontinuous at every rational point in (c,d]. Similarly, at irrational points x0, y is continuous because approaching from rationals, y approaches c, but y(x0)=x0. Unless c = x0, which only occurs at x0=c. Therefore, y is discontinuous at all rational points in (c,d]. Hence, y is discontinuous on a dense subset of [c,d], hence y is discontinuous everywhere on [c,d] except possibly at c.

Therefore, this y is discontinuous on [c,d], hence discontinuous overall. Therefore, even with a non-constant f (since f increases on [a,c] and is constant on [c,d], then decreases on [d,b]), we can construct a discontinuous y.

Therefore, such functions exist even when f is non-constant. So whether f is constant or not, we can have a discontinuous y. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But to make sure, let me think of another example. Suppose f is a sine wave on [0, 2π], continuous of course. The supremum on [0,x] would be 1 once x reaches π/2, since sin(π/2)=1, and then after that, the supremum remains 1. So for x ≥ π/2, y(x) must be π/2. For x &lt; π/2, y(x) must be x, since sin(x) is increasing on [0, π/2]. Therefore, y(x) is x for x ∈ [0, π/2] and π/2 for x ∈ [π/2, 2π]. This y is continuous, since at π/2, the left limit is π/2 and the right limit is π/2. So y is continuous here. But if we modify y(x) for x ≥ π/2 to sometimes be π/2 and sometimes other points where f is 1. Wait, but after π/2, the maximum is always 1, which is achieved at π/2 and also at 3π/2, but wait, sin(3π/2) is -1, which is not the supremum. Wait, no, on [0, x], for x ≥ π/2, the supremum is 1, achieved only at π/2. Because after π/2, sin decreases to 0 at π, then negative values, so the maximum remains 1. So y(x) must be π/2 for x ≥ π/2. Therefore, y(x) is forced to be π/2 there, hence continuous. So in this case, even with a non-constant f, y is continuous.

So in some cases, even if f is non-constant, y has to be continuous. But in other cases, like when f has a flat part, we can make y discontinuous. Therefore, the existence depends on the function f. But the problem asks whether there exists any continuous f and discontinuous y such that the equation holds. So as long as there is at least one such pair, the answer is yes. Since we have examples where f is constant or has flat parts allowing y to be discontinuous, the answer is yes.

Another angle: suppose f is such that its maximum on [a,x] is not uniquely attained. Then y(x) can choose any maximum point, and by choosing different points in a discontinuous way, y can be made discontinuous. However, for continuous f, the set of maximum points on [a,x] is a closed set, and if the maximum is not unique, it&#x27;s a closed interval. So for example, if f is constant on some interval [c,d], then for x in [c,d], the maximum is attained on [c,x], which includes [c,x], so if we choose y(x) to be sometimes c and sometimes x in a discontinuous way, then y would be discontinuous.

Therefore, to have a discontinuous y, f must be non-strictly monotonic or have intervals where it&#x27;s constant. Therefore, such f exists, and for those f, we can construct discontinuous y. Hence, the answer is yes.

So, in summary, yes, such functions exist. For example, take f to be constant on [a,b], then any discontinuous y(x) ∈ [a,x] works. Or take f to have a flat part where y can be discontinuous, while keeping f continuous.

\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether there exists a continuous function \( f \) and a discontinuous function \( y \) such that the equation \(\sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) = f(y(x))\) holds for all \( x \in I = [a, b] \), we analyze the following key points:

1. **Supremum and Maximum**: For a continuous function \( f \) on a closed interval \([a, x]\), the supremum is attained as the maximum value. Therefore, there exists some \( y(x) \in [a, x] \) such that \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

2. **Constant Function Example**: If \( f \) is a constant function, then \( f(y(x)) \) will always equal the constant value for any \( y(x) \in [a, x] \). In this case, \( y(x) \) can be any function, including a discontinuous one. For example, \( y(x) \) could be defined as \( a \) for rational \( x \) and \( x \) for irrational \( x \), resulting in a discontinuous \( y \).

3. **Non-Constant Function Example**: For non-constant continuous functions \( f \) with intervals where \( f \) is constant or has flat parts, \( y(x) \) can be discontinuous on those intervals. For instance, if \( f \) is constant on a subinterval \([c, d]\), \( y(x) \) can jump between different points in \([a, x]\) while still satisfying \( f(y(x)) = \sup_{t \in [a,x]} f(t) \).

4. **Verification**: Even if \( f \) is non-constant, as long as there are intervals where the maximum is not uniquely attained (e.g., flat parts), \( y(x) \) can be chosen discontinuously. For example, defining \( y(x) \) to jump between endpoints of the flat part in a discontinuous manner.

Thus, there exist continuous functions \( f \) and discontinuous functions \( y \) that satisfy the given equation. Examples include constant functions with discontinuous \( y \) and non-constant functions with flat parts allowing discontinuous \( y \).

Response: One inch is 1/12 of a foot. Ergo, 2 inches is equal to 2/12 feet, or one-twelfth a foot. One inch is 1/36 feet, or one-thirtieth of a foot. The circumference of a circle is equal to 2 times the number 1/30 times the length of a foot, or one-twenty-fifth of a foot. The area of the circle is equivalent to \pi \cdot (4/20)^2, or one-twentieth of a square foot. \boxed{5}          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: The circumference of a circle is equal to 2 times the radius times π, so it seems that the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the radius squared is just 2 times the constant π. So if the product of two inches and the circumference of a circle is just equal to the area, then it must be 2 inches times 2h, which is 4h squared. But this should be equal to (2) times the constant π times the radius squared, so \boxed{\pi r^2}. \boxed{\pi}.          </p>

User: What is the factorization of $x^{4} + 2x^{2} + 2$? Write your answer in \boxed{} format.

Assistant: \boxed{x^{2} + 1}\cdot(x^{2} + 2). If we want x-intercepts, we see that the second factor has decimals where the first factor doesn&#x27;t. \boxed{x^2 + 1} = (x + 1)(x - 1) \boxed{x^{2} + 2} = (x + 1)^{2} (Example 1)

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Let&#x27;s expand each parenthesis first: *$(x^{22}-3x^{5} + x^{-2} - 7) = x^{22}-3x^{5} + x^{-2} -7x^{22}$

$x^{22}-3x^{5} = x^{22}\cdot x^{-5} - 3\cdot x^{5} \cdot x^{-5}$

$=x^{22+(-5)} - 3\cdot(x^{5+(-5)} )$

$=x^{27} - 3\cdot x^{0}$

$=x^{27} - 3\cdot 1$ = $x^{27} - 3$

$x^{-2} - 7 = (-7\cdot 7\cdot x^{-5} ) - 7$

$=7x^{-7} - 7$

$=7\cdot x^{-7} - 7 = (-7\cdot x^{-5})\cdot x^{-2}$

$=7x^{-9} - (-7)$

$=7x^{-9} + 7$

$x^{-2} = 1/x^{2}$ (you multiply by 1, so the result is the same)

$1/x^{2} = x^{-2}$

The polynomial on the right side of our final result is just $x^{27} - 3 - 7x^{-9} + 7$. \boxed{x^{27} - 3 - 7x^{-9} + 7}          </p>
