Response: It is a Euclidean domain \boxed{Yes}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain. Hmm, let&#x27;s start by recalling some definitions. A Euclidean domain is an integral domain where we can perform the Euclidean algorithm, which basically means there&#x27;s a way to measure the &quot;size&quot; of elements (called a Euclidean function) such that for any two elements \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b \neq 0\)), there exist \(q\) and \(r\) where \(a = bq + r\) and either \(r = 0\) or the size of \(r\) is less than the size of \(b\).

First, let me make sure I understand the ring in question. The ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) consists of all numbers of the form \(a + b\left(\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers. Let me simplify that expression a bit. Let me denote \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\). So the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\).

I know that \(\theta\) is a root of a quadratic equation. Let me find its minimal polynomial. If \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\), then multiplying both sides by 2 gives \(2\theta = \sqrt{13} + 1\). Rearranging, \(\sqrt{13} = 2\theta - 1\). Squaring both sides, \(13 = (2\theta - 1)^2 = 4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1\). Then, moving everything to one side: \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1 - 13 = 0\), so \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta - 12 = 0\). Dividing both sides by 4: \(\theta^2 - \theta - 3 = 0\). So the minimal polynomial is \(x^2 - x - 3\). Therefore, \(\theta\) is an algebraic integer of degree 2, which means \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Wait, hold on. The ring of integers in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is typically \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{d}}{2}\right]\) when \(d \equiv 1 \mod 4\), and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]\) otherwise. Here, \(d = 13\), which is 1 mod 4, so the ring of integers should be \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). But in our case, the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\), which is the same as \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). So actually, this ring is the full ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Therefore, we are dealing with the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Now, I need to recall whether this ring is a Euclidean domain. I know that for quadratic fields, some rings of integers are Euclidean, and others are not. For example, \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) (Gaussian integers) and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]\) are Euclidean, but others like \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]\) are not even UFDs.

But since 13 is a positive square-free integer, we&#x27;re dealing with a real quadratic field. Now, the question is whether its ring of integers is Euclidean with respect to the norm. Sometimes real quadratic fields are Euclidean, sometimes not. I remember that for small discriminants, like 5, 8, 12, etc., some are Euclidean. But I need to check specifically for 13.

Wait, let me recall: The Minkowski bound for the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) can be used to check whether it is a PID. If the class number is 1, then it is a PID. Now, Euclidean domains are PIDs, but not all PIDs are Euclidean. So even if the class number is 1, it might not be Euclidean. But for some quadratic fields, it&#x27;s known whether they are Euclidean.

Looking up my memory, I think that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) has class number 1. Let me verify that. For real quadratic fields, the class number is more complicated, but I recall that 13 is a prime where the class number is 1. Wait, primes like 5, 13, 17... Hmm, I need to be careful. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\) has class number 1, but \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{10})\) does not. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall specific results. According to what I remember, the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed a PID, hence has class number 1. But is it Euclidean? Some references say that for real quadratic fields, Euclideanity is known for certain cases. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7})\), and some others are Euclidean with respect to the norm. However, for 13, I need to check.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: A real quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is norm-Euclidean if and only if \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, 73\). Wait, but I might be mixing up different sources. Let me verify.

Actually, according to some references, the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields are those with \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37,\) and \( 73\). So 13 is included here. Wait, but I need to check if this is accurate.

Alternatively, I can check specific literature. For example, in the case of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), the ring of integers is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\), which is the same as our ring. Now, according to some sources, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is norm-Euclidean. Let me recall that the norm in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is given by \(N(a + b\sqrt{d}) = a^2 - db^2\). But in our case, since the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) where \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the norm would be \(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;)\), where \(\theta&#x27;\) is the conjugate of \(\theta\). Since \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the conjugate is \(\theta&#x27; = \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}\). So expanding the norm:

\(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;) = a^2 + ab(\theta + \theta&#x27;) + b^2 \theta \theta&#x27;\).

We know from the minimal polynomial that \(\theta + \theta&#x27; = 1\) (since the coefficient of \(x\) in \(x^2 - x - 3\) is -1, so sum of roots is 1) and \(\theta \theta&#x27; = -3\) (the constant term). Therefore:

\(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab(1) + b^2(-3) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\).

So the norm here is \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). For the ring to be Euclidean, given any elements \(a\) and \(b\) in the ring (\(b \neq 0\)), there should exist \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\).

So to prove it&#x27;s Euclidean, we need to show that for any \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exists \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\).

Alternatively, this can sometimes be approached by showing that for any element \(\alpha / \beta\) in \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists an element \(\gamma\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\alpha/\beta - \gamma) &lt; 1\). This is equivalent to the ring being Euclidean, as the norm is multiplicative.

So, let me think about this. For any element \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), we need to find \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

Since \(\xi\) can be written as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\), we need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) by integers such that the norm of \((x - a) + (y - b)\theta\) is less than 1.

Let me write \(\xi = s + t\theta\), where \(s, t \in \mathbb{Q}\). Then, the norm of \(\xi - \gamma\) where \(\gamma = a + b\theta\) is:

\(N((s - a) + (t - b)\theta) = (s - a)^2 + (s - a)(t - b) - 3(t - b)^2\).

We need this to be less than 1.

To ensure this, we need to find integers \(a, b\) such that \(|s - a|\) and \(|t - b|\) are small enough such that the above expression is less than 1.

Alternatively, since \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is a lattice in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), the problem reduces to covering the plane with regions around each lattice point such that every point in the plane is within a distance less than 1 (in the norm) from some lattice point. If such a covering is possible, then the ring is Euclidean.

But visualizing this for the norm \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\) might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can use the geometry of numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I can check known results. If \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is known to be norm-Euclidean, then the answer is yes. Let me check my memory again. I recall that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed one of the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields. For example, according to the book &quot;Introductory Algebraic Number Theory&quot; by Alaca and Williams, the list of norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields includes those with discriminant 5, 8, 12, 13, 17, 21, 24, 28, 29, 33, 37, etc. So 13 is included. Therefore, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But to be thorough, let me attempt to outline why \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is Euclidean. Let&#x27;s consider the norm function \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). Suppose we have two elements \(\alpha, \beta \neq 0\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), and we want to divide \(\alpha\) by \(\beta\).

Compute \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Express \(\xi\) as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\). We need to find \(q = m + n\theta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Let \(x = m + \delta\) and \(y = n + \epsilon\), where \(m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(\delta, \epsilon \in (-1/2, 1/2]\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = (\delta + \epsilon \theta)^2 + (\delta + \epsilon \theta)(\epsilon) - 3\epsilon^2\).

Wait, maybe this approach isn&#x27;t straightforward. Let&#x27;s instead compute the norm directly:

\(N(\xi - q) = (x - m)^2 + (x - m)(y - n) - 3(y - n)^2\).

Let me set \(u = x - m\) and \(v = y - n\), so \(|u| \leq 1/2\) and \(|v| \leq 1/2\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

We need to show that this is less than 1 for some choice of \(m, n\) such that \(|u|, |v| \leq 1/2\).

Wait, but actually, \(u\) and \(v\) can be in the interval \((-1/2, 1/2]\), so we need to check the maximum possible value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) over that square.

But let me compute the maximum value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) for \(u, v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

To find the maximum, we can take partial derivatives. Let \(f(u, v) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

Compute \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = 2u + v\), and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = u - 6v\).

Setting the derivatives to zero:

1. \(2u + v = 0\)
2. \(u - 6v = 0\)

From the second equation: \(u = 6v\). Plugging into the first equation: \(2(6v) + v = 0 \implies 13v = 0 \implies v = 0\). Then \(u = 0\). So the critical point is at (0, 0), which is a minimum? Wait, check the second derivatives.

The Hessian matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; -6
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant is (2)(-6) - (1)(1) = -12 - 1 = -13 &lt; 0. So the critical point at (0,0) is a saddle point. Therefore, the maximum of \(f(u, v)\) on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) occurs on the boundary.

So let&#x27;s check the boundaries.

Case 1: \(u = 1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

Then, \(f(1/2, v) = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 + (1/2)v - 3v^2\).

This is a quadratic in v. The maximum occurs either at the vertex or endpoints.

Vertex at \(v = -b/(2a)\). Here, a = -3, b = 1/2.

So vertex at \(v = -(1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/6 = 1/12\). Within the interval [-1/2, 1/2].

Compute f(1/2, 1/12) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/12) - 3*(1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Convert to 48 denominators:

12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Compute endpoints:

At v = -1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3*(1/4) = 0 - 3/4 = -3/4.

At v = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum on this edge is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Case 2: \(u = -1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(-1/2, v) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 - (1/2)v - 3v^2.

Again, quadratic in v with a = -3, b = -1/2.

Vertex at v = -(-1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/(-6) = -1/12.

Compute f(-1/2, -1/12) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/12) - 3*(-1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Same as before, 12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

At endpoints:

v = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

v = 1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum here is 13/48.

Case 3: \(v = 1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, 1/2) = u^2 + u*(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = u^2 + u/2 - 3/4.

This is quadratic in u, opening upwards. The vertex is at u = -b/(2a) = -(1/2)/(2*1) = -1/4.

Compute f(-1/4, 1/2) = (-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

At endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = -1/4 as before.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum on this edge is -1/4, which is not higher than previous maxima.

Case 4: \(v = -1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, -1/2) = u^2 + u*(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = u^2 - u/2 - 3/4.

Quadratic in u, vertex at u = (1/2)/(2*1) = 1/4.

Compute f(1/4, -1/2) = (1/4)^2 - (1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

Endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = -3/4.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = (-1/2)^2 - (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum here is -1/4.

Case 5: Edges where u or v is fixed at 1/2 or -1/2, but we already covered all edges.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(N(\xi - q)\) over the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708, which is less than 1. Therefore, for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\). Hence, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is norm-Euclidean.

Wait, hold on. If the maximum of \(N(\xi - q)\) is 13/48 which is approximately 0.27, which is definitely less than 1. Therefore, this would imply that the norm is a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring is Euclidean.

But wait, this seems conflicting with my initial uncertainty, but according to the calculation, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain is less than 1, it is Euclidean. Therefore, the answer should be yes, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have two elements in the ring, say \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), and try to divide them. Let&#x27;s take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = 2\). Then, \(\xi = \theta / 2 = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4\). So we need to find \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Express \(\xi\) as \(0 + (1/4)\theta\). So \(x = 0\), \(y = 1/4\). We need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) with integers \(m\) and \(n\). The closest integers to \(x = 0\) is \(m = 0\), and to \(y = 1/4\) is \(n = 0\) or \(n = 1\). Let&#x27;s check both:

If \(n = 0\), then \(q = 0 + 0\theta = 0\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi\), and \(N(\xi) = (0)^2 + (0)(1/4) - 3*(1/4)^2 = -3/16\). The norm is negative, but in absolute value, 3/16, which is less than 1.

But wait, the norm can be negative here? The norm in a real quadratic field is \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\), which can indeed be negative. However, when we talk about the Euclidean function, we usually take the absolute value of the norm. So in this case, |N(\xi - q)| = 3/16 &lt; 1. So this works.

Alternatively, if we take \(n = 1\), then \(q = 0 + 1\theta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi - \theta = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4 - (1 + \sqrt{13})/2 = (-1 - \sqrt{13})/4\). Then, N(\xi - q) = [(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta] has norm:

Let me compute it:

(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta = -1/4 - (1/4)\theta. The norm is:

(-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(-1/4) - 3*(-1/4)^2 = 1/16 + 1/16 - 3/16 = (1 + 1 - 3)/16 = (-1)/16. Absolute value is 1/16, which is even smaller. So either way, the norm is less than 1. Therefore, in this case, we can write \(\theta = 2*0 + r\) where \(N(r) = 3/16 &lt; N(2) = 4\), but actually, in the division, since we are allowed to choose any q, even if the norm is negative, as long as the absolute value is less than N(b). Wait, but in the division algorithm, the remainder can have norm less than that of beta. However, in this case, the norm of beta is N(2) = 4. The remainder here has norm |N(r)| = 3/16, which is less than 4. But actually, in the standard division algorithm, we have \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\). However, in the case of negative norms, perhaps we need to take the absolute value? Wait, the norm here is actually the field norm, which can be positive or negative. But in the context of Euclidean domains, the Euclidean function is usually taken to be the absolute value of the norm.

Wait, but in the case of the Gaussian integers, the norm is always non-negative, so it&#x27;s clear. In real quadratic fields, the norm can be negative, but since we need the Euclidean function to map to non-negative integers, we take the absolute value. Therefore, the Euclidean function here is |N(a)|. Therefore, when we say \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\), it&#x27;s actually |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So even if r has a negative norm, as long as its absolute value is less than |N(b)|, it&#x27;s okay.

But in our calculation above, when we approximated \(\xi = \theta / 2\) by q = 0, we got |N(\(\xi - 0\))| = 3/16 &lt; |N(2)| = 4. Wait, but 3/16 is much less than 4. However, in the division algorithm, we need |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So in this case, 3/16 &lt; 4, so it&#x27;s fine. Therefore, the division works.

Another example: take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, dividing \(\theta\) by \(\theta\), we get \(\xi = 1\), which is already in the ring, so the remainder is 0.

Alternatively, take \(\alpha = 1 + \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi = (1 + \theta)/\theta = 1/\theta + 1\). Since \(\theta\) satisfies \(\theta^2 = \theta + 3\), so \(1/\theta = (\theta - 1)/3\). Therefore, \(\xi = (\theta - 1)/3 + 1 = (theta - 1 + 3)/3 = (theta + 2)/3. So approximate this by some q in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\). Let me compute the numerical values.

theta = (1 + sqrt(13))/2 ≈ (1 + 3.6055)/2 ≈ 4.6055/2 ≈ 2.30275.

So xi = (theta + 2)/3 ≈ (2.30275 + 2)/3 ≈ 4.30275/3 ≈ 1.43425.

So in terms of the basis {1, theta}, xi is approximately 1.43425. So express this as x + y theta, where x and y are rational numbers. Wait, but xi = (theta + 2)/3, which is (2)/3 + (1)/3 theta. So x = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 and y = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333. So we need to approximate x and y with integers m and n. The closest integers to x = 2/3 is m = 1 or 0. If we take m = 1, then n should be 0 or 1? Wait, y = 1/3. The closest integer to 1/3 is 0. So maybe take m = 1, n = 0. Then, q = 1 + 0*theta = 1. Then, the remainder is xi - q = (2/3 - 1) + (1/3 - 0) theta = (-1/3) + (1/3) theta. The norm of this is:

N(-1/3 + (1/3)theta) = (-1/3)^2 + (-1/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 1/9 - 1/9 - 3/9 = (-3)/9 = -1/3. Absolute value is 1/3, which is less than |N(beta)| = |N(theta)| = |1^2 + 1*1 - 3*1^2| = |1 + 1 - 3| = |-1| = 1. So 1/3 &lt; 1, which works. Therefore, the remainder has norm less than that of beta, so the division works.

Alternatively, if we choose m = 0 and n = 0, then q = 0. The remainder is xi - 0 = xi, whose norm is:

N(2/3 + (1/3)theta) = (2/3)^2 + (2/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 4/9 + 2/9 - 3/9 = (4 + 2 - 3)/9 = 3/9 = 1/3. Absolute value 1/3 &lt; 1. So either way, we get a remainder with smaller norm.

Therefore, these examples support the conclusion that the ring is Euclidean.

Additionally, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain was found to be 13/48 ≈ 0.27, which is less than 1, this implies that the ring is indeed norm-Euclidean.

Therefore, after this thorough check, I can conclude that \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain, we start by noting that this ring is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). The element \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\) is an algebraic integer with minimal polynomial \(x^2 - x - 3\), which confirms that \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is indeed the ring of integers.

A key property of Euclidean domains is the existence of a Euclidean function, typically the absolute value of the norm in quadratic fields. For the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), the norm of an element \(a + b\theta\) is given by \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). 

To verify the Euclidean property, we need to show that for any elements \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exist \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\). This is equivalent to showing that for any \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

By analyzing the norm function and checking the maximum value of \(N(\xi - \gamma)\) over the fundamental domain, we find that the maximum norm on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is \(\frac{13}{48}\), which is less than 1. This ensures that for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that the norm of the remainder is less than the norm of \(\beta\).

Examples and calculations confirm that the division algorithm holds, and the norm function serves as a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain. Hmm, let&#x27;s start by recalling some definitions. A Euclidean domain is an integral domain where we can perform the Euclidean algorithm, which basically means there&#x27;s a way to measure the &quot;size&quot; of elements (called a Euclidean function) such that for any two elements \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b \neq 0\)), there exist \(q\) and \(r\) where \(a = bq + r\) and either \(r = 0\) or the size of \(r\) is less than the size of \(b\).

First, let me make sure I understand the ring in question. The ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) consists of all numbers of the form \(a + b\left(\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers. Let me simplify that expression a bit. Let me denote \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\). So the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\).

I know that \(\theta\) is a root of a quadratic equation. Let me find its minimal polynomial. If \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\), then multiplying both sides by 2 gives \(2\theta = \sqrt{13} + 1\). Rearranging, \(\sqrt{13} = 2\theta - 1\). Squaring both sides, \(13 = (2\theta - 1)^2 = 4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1\). Then, moving everything to one side: \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1 - 13 = 0\), so \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta - 12 = 0\). Dividing both sides by 4: \(\theta^2 - \theta - 3 = 0\). So the minimal polynomial is \(x^2 - x - 3\). Therefore, \(\theta\) is an algebraic integer of degree 2, which means \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Wait, hold on. The ring of integers in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is typically \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{d}}{2}\right]\) when \(d \equiv 1 \mod 4\), and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]\) otherwise. Here, \(d = 13\), which is 1 mod 4, so the ring of integers should be \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). But in our case, the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\), which is the same as \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). So actually, this ring is the full ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Therefore, we are dealing with the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Now, I need to recall whether this ring is a Euclidean domain. I know that for quadratic fields, some rings of integers are Euclidean, and others are not. For example, \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) (Gaussian integers) and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]\) are Euclidean, but others like \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]\) are not even UFDs.

But since 13 is a positive square-free integer, we&#x27;re dealing with a real quadratic field. Now, the question is whether its ring of integers is Euclidean with respect to the norm. Sometimes real quadratic fields are Euclidean, sometimes not. I remember that for small discriminants, like 5, 8, 12, etc., some are Euclidean. But I need to check specifically for 13.

Wait, let me recall: The Minkowski bound for the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) can be used to check whether it is a PID. If the class number is 1, then it is a PID. Now, Euclidean domains are PIDs, but not all PIDs are Euclidean. So even if the class number is 1, it might not be Euclidean. But for some quadratic fields, it&#x27;s known whether they are Euclidean.

Looking up my memory, I think that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) has class number 1. Let me verify that. For real quadratic fields, the class number is more complicated, but I recall that 13 is a prime where the class number is 1. Wait, primes like 5, 13, 17... Hmm, I need to be careful. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\) has class number 1, but \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{10})\) does not. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall specific results. According to what I remember, the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed a PID, hence has class number 1. But is it Euclidean? Some references say that for real quadratic fields, Euclideanity is known for certain cases. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7})\), and some others are Euclidean with respect to the norm. However, for 13, I need to check.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: A real quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is norm-Euclidean if and only if \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, 73\). Wait, but I might be mixing up different sources. Let me verify.

Actually, according to some references, the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields are those with \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37,\) and \( 73\). So 13 is included here. Wait, but I need to check if this is accurate.

Alternatively, I can check specific literature. For example, in the case of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), the ring of integers is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\), which is the same as our ring. Now, according to some sources, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is norm-Euclidean. Let me recall that the norm in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is given by \(N(a + b\sqrt{d}) = a^2 - db^2\). But in our case, since the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) where \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the norm would be \(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;)\), where \(\theta&#x27;\) is the conjugate of \(\theta\). Since \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the conjugate is \(\theta&#x27; = \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}\). So expanding the norm:

\(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;) = a^2 + ab(\theta + \theta&#x27;) + b^2 \theta \theta&#x27;\).

We know from the minimal polynomial that \(\theta + \theta&#x27; = 1\) (since the coefficient of \(x\) in \(x^2 - x - 3\) is -1, so sum of roots is 1) and \(\theta \theta&#x27; = -3\) (the constant term). Therefore:

\(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab(1) + b^2(-3) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\).

So the norm here is \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). For the ring to be Euclidean, given any elements \(a\) and \(b\) in the ring (\(b \neq 0\)), there should exist \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\).

So to prove it&#x27;s Euclidean, we need to show that for any \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exists \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\).

Alternatively, this can sometimes be approached by showing that for any element \(\alpha / \beta\) in \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists an element \(\gamma\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\alpha/\beta - \gamma) &lt; 1\). This is equivalent to the ring being Euclidean, as the norm is multiplicative.

So, let me think about this. For any element \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), we need to find \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

Since \(\xi\) can be written as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\), we need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) by integers such that the norm of \((x - a) + (y - b)\theta\) is less than 1.

Let me write \(\xi = s + t\theta\), where \(s, t \in \mathbb{Q}\). Then, the norm of \(\xi - \gamma\) where \(\gamma = a + b\theta\) is:

\(N((s - a) + (t - b)\theta) = (s - a)^2 + (s - a)(t - b) - 3(t - b)^2\).

We need this to be less than 1.

To ensure this, we need to find integers \(a, b\) such that \(|s - a|\) and \(|t - b|\) are small enough such that the above expression is less than 1.

Alternatively, since \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is a lattice in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), the problem reduces to covering the plane with regions around each lattice point such that every point in the plane is within a distance less than 1 (in the norm) from some lattice point. If such a covering is possible, then the ring is Euclidean.

But visualizing this for the norm \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\) might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can use the geometry of numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I can check known results. If \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is known to be norm-Euclidean, then the answer is yes. Let me check my memory again. I recall that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed one of the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields. For example, according to the book &quot;Introductory Algebraic Number Theory&quot; by Alaca and Williams, the list of norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields includes those with discriminant 5, 8, 12, 13, 17, 21, 24, 28, 29, 33, 37, etc. So 13 is included. Therefore, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But to be thorough, let me attempt to outline why \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is Euclidean. Let&#x27;s consider the norm function \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). Suppose we have two elements \(\alpha, \beta \neq 0\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), and we want to divide \(\alpha\) by \(\beta\).

Compute \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Express \(\xi\) as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\). We need to find \(q = m + n\theta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Let \(x = m + \delta\) and \(y = n + \epsilon\), where \(m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(\delta, \epsilon \in (-1/2, 1/2]\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = (\delta + \epsilon \theta)^2 + (\delta + \epsilon \theta)(\epsilon) - 3\epsilon^2\).

Wait, maybe this approach isn&#x27;t straightforward. Let&#x27;s instead compute the norm directly:

\(N(\xi - q) = (x - m)^2 + (x - m)(y - n) - 3(y - n)^2\).

Let me set \(u = x - m\) and \(v = y - n\), so \(|u| \leq 1/2\) and \(|v| \leq 1/2\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

We need to show that this is less than 1 for some choice of \(m, n\) such that \(|u|, |v| \leq 1/2\).

Wait, but actually, \(u\) and \(v\) can be in the interval \((-1/2, 1/2]\), so we need to check the maximum possible value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) over that square.

But let me compute the maximum value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) for \(u, v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

To find the maximum, we can take partial derivatives. Let \(f(u, v) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

Compute \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = 2u + v\), and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = u - 6v\).

Setting the derivatives to zero:

1. \(2u + v = 0\)
2. \(u - 6v = 0\)

From the second equation: \(u = 6v\). Plugging into the first equation: \(2(6v) + v = 0 \implies 13v = 0 \implies v = 0\). Then \(u = 0\). So the critical point is at (0, 0), which is a minimum? Wait, check the second derivatives.

The Hessian matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; -6
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant is (2)(-6) - (1)(1) = -12 - 1 = -13 &lt; 0. So the critical point at (0,0) is a saddle point. Therefore, the maximum of \(f(u, v)\) on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) occurs on the boundary.

So let&#x27;s check the boundaries.

Case 1: \(u = 1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

Then, \(f(1/2, v) = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 + (1/2)v - 3v^2\).

This is a quadratic in v. The maximum occurs either at the vertex or endpoints.

Vertex at \(v = -b/(2a)\). Here, a = -3, b = 1/2.

So vertex at \(v = -(1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/6 = 1/12\). Within the interval [-1/2, 1/2].

Compute f(1/2, 1/12) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/12) - 3*(1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Convert to 48 denominators:

12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Compute endpoints:

At v = -1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3*(1/4) = 0 - 3/4 = -3/4.

At v = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum on this edge is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Case 2: \(u = -1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(-1/2, v) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 - (1/2)v - 3v^2.

Again, quadratic in v with a = -3, b = -1/2.

Vertex at v = -(-1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/(-6) = -1/12.

Compute f(-1/2, -1/12) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/12) - 3*(-1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Same as before, 12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

At endpoints:

v = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

v = 1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum here is 13/48.

Case 3: \(v = 1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, 1/2) = u^2 + u*(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = u^2 + u/2 - 3/4.

This is quadratic in u, opening upwards. The vertex is at u = -b/(2a) = -(1/2)/(2*1) = -1/4.

Compute f(-1/4, 1/2) = (-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

At endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = -1/4 as before.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum on this edge is -1/4, which is not higher than previous maxima.

Case 4: \(v = -1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, -1/2) = u^2 + u*(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = u^2 - u/2 - 3/4.

Quadratic in u, vertex at u = (1/2)/(2*1) = 1/4.

Compute f(1/4, -1/2) = (1/4)^2 - (1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

Endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = -3/4.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = (-1/2)^2 - (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum here is -1/4.

Case 5: Edges where u or v is fixed at 1/2 or -1/2, but we already covered all edges.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(N(\xi - q)\) over the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708, which is less than 1. Therefore, for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\). Hence, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is norm-Euclidean.

Wait, hold on. If the maximum of \(N(\xi - q)\) is 13/48 which is approximately 0.27, which is definitely less than 1. Therefore, this would imply that the norm is a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring is Euclidean.

But wait, this seems conflicting with my initial uncertainty, but according to the calculation, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain is less than 1, it is Euclidean. Therefore, the answer should be yes, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have two elements in the ring, say \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), and try to divide them. Let&#x27;s take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = 2\). Then, \(\xi = \theta / 2 = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4\). So we need to find \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Express \(\xi\) as \(0 + (1/4)\theta\). So \(x = 0\), \(y = 1/4\). We need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) with integers \(m\) and \(n\). The closest integers to \(x = 0\) is \(m = 0\), and to \(y = 1/4\) is \(n = 0\) or \(n = 1\). Let&#x27;s check both:

If \(n = 0\), then \(q = 0 + 0\theta = 0\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi\), and \(N(\xi) = (0)^2 + (0)(1/4) - 3*(1/4)^2 = -3/16\). The norm is negative, but in absolute value, 3/16, which is less than 1.

But wait, the norm can be negative here? The norm in a real quadratic field is \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\), which can indeed be negative. However, when we talk about the Euclidean function, we usually take the absolute value of the norm. So in this case, |N(\xi - q)| = 3/16 &lt; 1. So this works.

Alternatively, if we take \(n = 1\), then \(q = 0 + 1\theta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi - \theta = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4 - (1 + \sqrt{13})/2 = (-1 - \sqrt{13})/4\). Then, N(\xi - q) = [(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta] has norm:

Let me compute it:

(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta = -1/4 - (1/4)\theta. The norm is:

(-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(-1/4) - 3*(-1/4)^2 = 1/16 + 1/16 - 3/16 = (1 + 1 - 3)/16 = (-1)/16. Absolute value is 1/16, which is even smaller. So either way, the norm is less than 1. Therefore, in this case, we can write \(\theta = 2*0 + r\) where \(N(r) = 3/16 &lt; N(2) = 4\), but actually, in the division, since we are allowed to choose any q, even if the norm is negative, as long as the absolute value is less than N(b). Wait, but in the division algorithm, the remainder can have norm less than that of beta. However, in this case, the norm of beta is N(2) = 4. The remainder here has norm |N(r)| = 3/16, which is less than 4. But actually, in the standard division algorithm, we have \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\). However, in the case of negative norms, perhaps we need to take the absolute value? Wait, the norm here is actually the field norm, which can be positive or negative. But in the context of Euclidean domains, the Euclidean function is usually taken to be the absolute value of the norm.

Wait, but in the case of the Gaussian integers, the norm is always non-negative, so it&#x27;s clear. In real quadratic fields, the norm can be negative, but since we need the Euclidean function to map to non-negative integers, we take the absolute value. Therefore, the Euclidean function here is |N(a)|. Therefore, when we say \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\), it&#x27;s actually |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So even if r has a negative norm, as long as its absolute value is less than |N(b)|, it&#x27;s okay.

But in our calculation above, when we approximated \(\xi = \theta / 2\) by q = 0, we got |N(\(\xi - 0\))| = 3/16 &lt; |N(2)| = 4. Wait, but 3/16 is much less than 4. However, in the division algorithm, we need |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So in this case, 3/16 &lt; 4, so it&#x27;s fine. Therefore, the division works.

Another example: take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, dividing \(\theta\) by \(\theta\), we get \(\xi = 1\), which is already in the ring, so the remainder is 0.

Alternatively, take \(\alpha = 1 + \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi = (1 + \theta)/\theta = 1/\theta + 1\). Since \(\theta\) satisfies \(\theta^2 = \theta + 3\), so \(1/\theta = (\theta - 1)/3\). Therefore, \(\xi = (\theta - 1)/3 + 1 = (theta - 1 + 3)/3 = (theta + 2)/3. So approximate this by some q in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\). Let me compute the numerical values.

theta = (1 + sqrt(13))/2 ≈ (1 + 3.6055)/2 ≈ 4.6055/2 ≈ 2.30275.

So xi = (theta + 2)/3 ≈ (2.30275 + 2)/3 ≈ 4.30275/3 ≈ 1.43425.

So in terms of the basis {1, theta}, xi is approximately 1.43425. So express this as x + y theta, where x and y are rational numbers. Wait, but xi = (theta + 2)/3, which is (2)/3 + (1)/3 theta. So x = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 and y = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333. So we need to approximate x and y with integers m and n. The closest integers to x = 2/3 is m = 1 or 0. If we take m = 1, then n should be 0 or 1? Wait, y = 1/3. The closest integer to 1/3 is 0. So maybe take m = 1, n = 0. Then, q = 1 + 0*theta = 1. Then, the remainder is xi - q = (2/3 - 1) + (1/3 - 0) theta = (-1/3) + (1/3) theta. The norm of this is:

N(-1/3 + (1/3)theta) = (-1/3)^2 + (-1/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 1/9 - 1/9 - 3/9 = (-3)/9 = -1/3. Absolute value is 1/3, which is less than |N(beta)| = |N(theta)| = |1^2 + 1*1 - 3*1^2| = |1 + 1 - 3| = |-1| = 1. So 1/3 &lt; 1, which works. Therefore, the remainder has norm less than that of beta, so the division works.

Alternatively, if we choose m = 0 and n = 0, then q = 0. The remainder is xi - 0 = xi, whose norm is:

N(2/3 + (1/3)theta) = (2/3)^2 + (2/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 4/9 + 2/9 - 3/9 = (4 + 2 - 3)/9 = 3/9 = 1/3. Absolute value 1/3 &lt; 1. So either way, we get a remainder with smaller norm.

Therefore, these examples support the conclusion that the ring is Euclidean.

Additionally, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain was found to be 13/48 ≈ 0.27, which is less than 1, this implies that the ring is indeed norm-Euclidean.

Therefore, after this thorough check, I can conclude that \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain, we start by noting that this ring is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). The element \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\) is an algebraic integer with minimal polynomial \(x^2 - x - 3\), which confirms that \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is indeed the ring of integers.

A key property of Euclidean domains is the existence of a Euclidean function, typically the absolute value of the norm in quadratic fields. For the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), the norm of an element \(a + b\theta\) is given by \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). 

To verify the Euclidean property, we need to show that for any elements \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exist \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\). This is equivalent to showing that for any \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

By analyzing the norm function and checking the maximum value of \(N(\xi - \gamma)\) over the fundamental domain, we find that the maximum norm on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is \(\frac{13}{48}\), which is less than 1. This ensures that for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that the norm of the remainder is less than the norm of \(\beta\).

Examples and calculations confirm that the division algorithm holds, and the norm function serves as a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain. Hmm, let&#x27;s start by recalling some definitions. A Euclidean domain is an integral domain where we can perform the Euclidean algorithm, which basically means there&#x27;s a way to measure the &quot;size&quot; of elements (called a Euclidean function) such that for any two elements \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b \neq 0\)), there exist \(q\) and \(r\) where \(a = bq + r\) and either \(r = 0\) or the size of \(r\) is less than the size of \(b\).

First, let me make sure I understand the ring in question. The ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) consists of all numbers of the form \(a + b\left(\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers. Let me simplify that expression a bit. Let me denote \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\). So the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\).

I know that \(\theta\) is a root of a quadratic equation. Let me find its minimal polynomial. If \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\), then multiplying both sides by 2 gives \(2\theta = \sqrt{13} + 1\). Rearranging, \(\sqrt{13} = 2\theta - 1\). Squaring both sides, \(13 = (2\theta - 1)^2 = 4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1\). Then, moving everything to one side: \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1 - 13 = 0\), so \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta - 12 = 0\). Dividing both sides by 4: \(\theta^2 - \theta - 3 = 0\). So the minimal polynomial is \(x^2 - x - 3\). Therefore, \(\theta\) is an algebraic integer of degree 2, which means \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Wait, hold on. The ring of integers in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is typically \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{d}}{2}\right]\) when \(d \equiv 1 \mod 4\), and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]\) otherwise. Here, \(d = 13\), which is 1 mod 4, so the ring of integers should be \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). But in our case, the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\), which is the same as \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). So actually, this ring is the full ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Therefore, we are dealing with the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Now, I need to recall whether this ring is a Euclidean domain. I know that for quadratic fields, some rings of integers are Euclidean, and others are not. For example, \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) (Gaussian integers) and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]\) are Euclidean, but others like \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]\) are not even UFDs.

But since 13 is a positive square-free integer, we&#x27;re dealing with a real quadratic field. Now, the question is whether its ring of integers is Euclidean with respect to the norm. Sometimes real quadratic fields are Euclidean, sometimes not. I remember that for small discriminants, like 5, 8, 12, etc., some are Euclidean. But I need to check specifically for 13.

Wait, let me recall: The Minkowski bound for the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) can be used to check whether it is a PID. If the class number is 1, then it is a PID. Now, Euclidean domains are PIDs, but not all PIDs are Euclidean. So even if the class number is 1, it might not be Euclidean. But for some quadratic fields, it&#x27;s known whether they are Euclidean.

Looking up my memory, I think that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) has class number 1. Let me verify that. For real quadratic fields, the class number is more complicated, but I recall that 13 is a prime where the class number is 1. Wait, primes like 5, 13, 17... Hmm, I need to be careful. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\) has class number 1, but \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{10})\) does not. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall specific results. According to what I remember, the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed a PID, hence has class number 1. But is it Euclidean? Some references say that for real quadratic fields, Euclideanity is known for certain cases. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7})\), and some others are Euclidean with respect to the norm. However, for 13, I need to check.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: A real quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is norm-Euclidean if and only if \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, 73\). Wait, but I might be mixing up different sources. Let me verify.

Actually, according to some references, the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields are those with \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37,\) and \( 73\). So 13 is included here. Wait, but I need to check if this is accurate.

Alternatively, I can check specific literature. For example, in the case of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), the ring of integers is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\), which is the same as our ring. Now, according to some sources, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is norm-Euclidean. Let me recall that the norm in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is given by \(N(a + b\sqrt{d}) = a^2 - db^2\). But in our case, since the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) where \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the norm would be \(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;)\), where \(\theta&#x27;\) is the conjugate of \(\theta\). Since \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the conjugate is \(\theta&#x27; = \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}\). So expanding the norm:

\(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;) = a^2 + ab(\theta + \theta&#x27;) + b^2 \theta \theta&#x27;\).

We know from the minimal polynomial that \(\theta + \theta&#x27; = 1\) (since the coefficient of \(x\) in \(x^2 - x - 3\) is -1, so sum of roots is 1) and \(\theta \theta&#x27; = -3\) (the constant term). Therefore:

\(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab(1) + b^2(-3) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\).

So the norm here is \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). For the ring to be Euclidean, given any elements \(a\) and \(b\) in the ring (\(b \neq 0\)), there should exist \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\).

So to prove it&#x27;s Euclidean, we need to show that for any \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exists \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\).

Alternatively, this can sometimes be approached by showing that for any element \(\alpha / \beta\) in \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists an element \(\gamma\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\alpha/\beta - \gamma) &lt; 1\). This is equivalent to the ring being Euclidean, as the norm is multiplicative.

So, let me think about this. For any element \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), we need to find \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

Since \(\xi\) can be written as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\), we need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) by integers such that the norm of \((x - a) + (y - b)\theta\) is less than 1.

Let me write \(\xi = s + t\theta\), where \(s, t \in \mathbb{Q}\). Then, the norm of \(\xi - \gamma\) where \(\gamma = a + b\theta\) is:

\(N((s - a) + (t - b)\theta) = (s - a)^2 + (s - a)(t - b) - 3(t - b)^2\).

We need this to be less than 1.

To ensure this, we need to find integers \(a, b\) such that \(|s - a|\) and \(|t - b|\) are small enough such that the above expression is less than 1.

Alternatively, since \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is a lattice in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), the problem reduces to covering the plane with regions around each lattice point such that every point in the plane is within a distance less than 1 (in the norm) from some lattice point. If such a covering is possible, then the ring is Euclidean.

But visualizing this for the norm \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\) might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can use the geometry of numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I can check known results. If \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is known to be norm-Euclidean, then the answer is yes. Let me check my memory again. I recall that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed one of the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields. For example, according to the book &quot;Introductory Algebraic Number Theory&quot; by Alaca and Williams, the list of norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields includes those with discriminant 5, 8, 12, 13, 17, 21, 24, 28, 29, 33, 37, etc. So 13 is included. Therefore, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But to be thorough, let me attempt to outline why \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is Euclidean. Let&#x27;s consider the norm function \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). Suppose we have two elements \(\alpha, \beta \neq 0\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), and we want to divide \(\alpha\) by \(\beta\).

Compute \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Express \(\xi\) as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\). We need to find \(q = m + n\theta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Let \(x = m + \delta\) and \(y = n + \epsilon\), where \(m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(\delta, \epsilon \in (-1/2, 1/2]\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = (\delta + \epsilon \theta)^2 + (\delta + \epsilon \theta)(\epsilon) - 3\epsilon^2\).

Wait, maybe this approach isn&#x27;t straightforward. Let&#x27;s instead compute the norm directly:

\(N(\xi - q) = (x - m)^2 + (x - m)(y - n) - 3(y - n)^2\).

Let me set \(u = x - m\) and \(v = y - n\), so \(|u| \leq 1/2\) and \(|v| \leq 1/2\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

We need to show that this is less than 1 for some choice of \(m, n\) such that \(|u|, |v| \leq 1/2\).

Wait, but actually, \(u\) and \(v\) can be in the interval \((-1/2, 1/2]\), so we need to check the maximum possible value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) over that square.

But let me compute the maximum value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) for \(u, v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

To find the maximum, we can take partial derivatives. Let \(f(u, v) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

Compute \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = 2u + v\), and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = u - 6v\).

Setting the derivatives to zero:

1. \(2u + v = 0\)
2. \(u - 6v = 0\)

From the second equation: \(u = 6v\). Plugging into the first equation: \(2(6v) + v = 0 \implies 13v = 0 \implies v = 0\). Then \(u = 0\). So the critical point is at (0, 0), which is a minimum? Wait, check the second derivatives.

The Hessian matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; -6
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant is (2)(-6) - (1)(1) = -12 - 1 = -13 &lt; 0. So the critical point at (0,0) is a saddle point. Therefore, the maximum of \(f(u, v)\) on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) occurs on the boundary.

So let&#x27;s check the boundaries.

Case 1: \(u = 1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

Then, \(f(1/2, v) = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 + (1/2)v - 3v^2\).

This is a quadratic in v. The maximum occurs either at the vertex or endpoints.

Vertex at \(v = -b/(2a)\). Here, a = -3, b = 1/2.

So vertex at \(v = -(1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/6 = 1/12\). Within the interval [-1/2, 1/2].

Compute f(1/2, 1/12) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/12) - 3*(1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Convert to 48 denominators:

12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Compute endpoints:

At v = -1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3*(1/4) = 0 - 3/4 = -3/4.

At v = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum on this edge is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Case 2: \(u = -1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(-1/2, v) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 - (1/2)v - 3v^2.

Again, quadratic in v with a = -3, b = -1/2.

Vertex at v = -(-1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/(-6) = -1/12.

Compute f(-1/2, -1/12) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/12) - 3*(-1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Same as before, 12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

At endpoints:

v = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

v = 1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum here is 13/48.

Case 3: \(v = 1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, 1/2) = u^2 + u*(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = u^2 + u/2 - 3/4.

This is quadratic in u, opening upwards. The vertex is at u = -b/(2a) = -(1/2)/(2*1) = -1/4.

Compute f(-1/4, 1/2) = (-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

At endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = -1/4 as before.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum on this edge is -1/4, which is not higher than previous maxima.

Case 4: \(v = -1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, -1/2) = u^2 + u*(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = u^2 - u/2 - 3/4.

Quadratic in u, vertex at u = (1/2)/(2*1) = 1/4.

Compute f(1/4, -1/2) = (1/4)^2 - (1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

Endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = -3/4.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = (-1/2)^2 - (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum here is -1/4.

Case 5: Edges where u or v is fixed at 1/2 or -1/2, but we already covered all edges.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(N(\xi - q)\) over the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708, which is less than 1. Therefore, for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\). Hence, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is norm-Euclidean.

Wait, hold on. If the maximum of \(N(\xi - q)\) is 13/48 which is approximately 0.27, which is definitely less than 1. Therefore, this would imply that the norm is a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring is Euclidean.

But wait, this seems conflicting with my initial uncertainty, but according to the calculation, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain is less than 1, it is Euclidean. Therefore, the answer should be yes, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have two elements in the ring, say \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), and try to divide them. Let&#x27;s take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = 2\). Then, \(\xi = \theta / 2 = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4\). So we need to find \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Express \(\xi\) as \(0 + (1/4)\theta\). So \(x = 0\), \(y = 1/4\). We need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) with integers \(m\) and \(n\). The closest integers to \(x = 0\) is \(m = 0\), and to \(y = 1/4\) is \(n = 0\) or \(n = 1\). Let&#x27;s check both:

If \(n = 0\), then \(q = 0 + 0\theta = 0\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi\), and \(N(\xi) = (0)^2 + (0)(1/4) - 3*(1/4)^2 = -3/16\). The norm is negative, but in absolute value, 3/16, which is less than 1.

But wait, the norm can be negative here? The norm in a real quadratic field is \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\), which can indeed be negative. However, when we talk about the Euclidean function, we usually take the absolute value of the norm. So in this case, |N(\xi - q)| = 3/16 &lt; 1. So this works.

Alternatively, if we take \(n = 1\), then \(q = 0 + 1\theta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi - \theta = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4 - (1 + \sqrt{13})/2 = (-1 - \sqrt{13})/4\). Then, N(\xi - q) = [(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta] has norm:

Let me compute it:

(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta = -1/4 - (1/4)\theta. The norm is:

(-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(-1/4) - 3*(-1/4)^2 = 1/16 + 1/16 - 3/16 = (1 + 1 - 3)/16 = (-1)/16. Absolute value is 1/16, which is even smaller. So either way, the norm is less than 1. Therefore, in this case, we can write \(\theta = 2*0 + r\) where \(N(r) = 3/16 &lt; N(2) = 4\), but actually, in the division, since we are allowed to choose any q, even if the norm is negative, as long as the absolute value is less than N(b). Wait, but in the division algorithm, the remainder can have norm less than that of beta. However, in this case, the norm of beta is N(2) = 4. The remainder here has norm |N(r)| = 3/16, which is less than 4. But actually, in the standard division algorithm, we have \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\). However, in the case of negative norms, perhaps we need to take the absolute value? Wait, the norm here is actually the field norm, which can be positive or negative. But in the context of Euclidean domains, the Euclidean function is usually taken to be the absolute value of the norm.

Wait, but in the case of the Gaussian integers, the norm is always non-negative, so it&#x27;s clear. In real quadratic fields, the norm can be negative, but since we need the Euclidean function to map to non-negative integers, we take the absolute value. Therefore, the Euclidean function here is |N(a)|. Therefore, when we say \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\), it&#x27;s actually |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So even if r has a negative norm, as long as its absolute value is less than |N(b)|, it&#x27;s okay.

But in our calculation above, when we approximated \(\xi = \theta / 2\) by q = 0, we got |N(\(\xi - 0\))| = 3/16 &lt; |N(2)| = 4. Wait, but 3/16 is much less than 4. However, in the division algorithm, we need |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So in this case, 3/16 &lt; 4, so it&#x27;s fine. Therefore, the division works.

Another example: take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, dividing \(\theta\) by \(\theta\), we get \(\xi = 1\), which is already in the ring, so the remainder is 0.

Alternatively, take \(\alpha = 1 + \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi = (1 + \theta)/\theta = 1/\theta + 1\). Since \(\theta\) satisfies \(\theta^2 = \theta + 3\), so \(1/\theta = (\theta - 1)/3\). Therefore, \(\xi = (\theta - 1)/3 + 1 = (theta - 1 + 3)/3 = (theta + 2)/3. So approximate this by some q in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\). Let me compute the numerical values.

theta = (1 + sqrt(13))/2 ≈ (1 + 3.6055)/2 ≈ 4.6055/2 ≈ 2.30275.

So xi = (theta + 2)/3 ≈ (2.30275 + 2)/3 ≈ 4.30275/3 ≈ 1.43425.

So in terms of the basis {1, theta}, xi is approximately 1.43425. So express this as x + y theta, where x and y are rational numbers. Wait, but xi = (theta + 2)/3, which is (2)/3 + (1)/3 theta. So x = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 and y = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333. So we need to approximate x and y with integers m and n. The closest integers to x = 2/3 is m = 1 or 0. If we take m = 1, then n should be 0 or 1? Wait, y = 1/3. The closest integer to 1/3 is 0. So maybe take m = 1, n = 0. Then, q = 1 + 0*theta = 1. Then, the remainder is xi - q = (2/3 - 1) + (1/3 - 0) theta = (-1/3) + (1/3) theta. The norm of this is:

N(-1/3 + (1/3)theta) = (-1/3)^2 + (-1/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 1/9 - 1/9 - 3/9 = (-3)/9 = -1/3. Absolute value is 1/3, which is less than |N(beta)| = |N(theta)| = |1^2 + 1*1 - 3*1^2| = |1 + 1 - 3| = |-1| = 1. So 1/3 &lt; 1, which works. Therefore, the remainder has norm less than that of beta, so the division works.

Alternatively, if we choose m = 0 and n = 0, then q = 0. The remainder is xi - 0 = xi, whose norm is:

N(2/3 + (1/3)theta) = (2/3)^2 + (2/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 4/9 + 2/9 - 3/9 = (4 + 2 - 3)/9 = 3/9 = 1/3. Absolute value 1/3 &lt; 1. So either way, we get a remainder with smaller norm.

Therefore, these examples support the conclusion that the ring is Euclidean.

Additionally, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain was found to be 13/48 ≈ 0.27, which is less than 1, this implies that the ring is indeed norm-Euclidean.

Therefore, after this thorough check, I can conclude that \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain, we start by noting that this ring is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). The element \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\) is an algebraic integer with minimal polynomial \(x^2 - x - 3\), which confirms that \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is indeed the ring of integers.

A key property of Euclidean domains is the existence of a Euclidean function, typically the absolute value of the norm in quadratic fields. For the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), the norm of an element \(a + b\theta\) is given by \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). 

To verify the Euclidean property, we need to show that for any elements \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exist \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\). This is equivalent to showing that for any \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

By analyzing the norm function and checking the maximum value of \(N(\xi - \gamma)\) over the fundamental domain, we find that the maximum norm on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is \(\frac{13}{48}\), which is less than 1. This ensures that for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that the norm of the remainder is less than the norm of \(\beta\).

Examples and calculations confirm that the division algorithm holds, and the norm function serves as a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain. Hmm, let&#x27;s start by recalling some definitions. A Euclidean domain is an integral domain where we can perform the Euclidean algorithm, which basically means there&#x27;s a way to measure the &quot;size&quot; of elements (called a Euclidean function) such that for any two elements \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b \neq 0\)), there exist \(q\) and \(r\) where \(a = bq + r\) and either \(r = 0\) or the size of \(r\) is less than the size of \(b\).

First, let me make sure I understand the ring in question. The ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) consists of all numbers of the form \(a + b\left(\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers. Let me simplify that expression a bit. Let me denote \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\). So the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\).

I know that \(\theta\) is a root of a quadratic equation. Let me find its minimal polynomial. If \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\), then multiplying both sides by 2 gives \(2\theta = \sqrt{13} + 1\). Rearranging, \(\sqrt{13} = 2\theta - 1\). Squaring both sides, \(13 = (2\theta - 1)^2 = 4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1\). Then, moving everything to one side: \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1 - 13 = 0\), so \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta - 12 = 0\). Dividing both sides by 4: \(\theta^2 - \theta - 3 = 0\). So the minimal polynomial is \(x^2 - x - 3\). Therefore, \(\theta\) is an algebraic integer of degree 2, which means \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Wait, hold on. The ring of integers in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is typically \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{d}}{2}\right]\) when \(d \equiv 1 \mod 4\), and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]\) otherwise. Here, \(d = 13\), which is 1 mod 4, so the ring of integers should be \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). But in our case, the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\), which is the same as \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). So actually, this ring is the full ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Therefore, we are dealing with the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Now, I need to recall whether this ring is a Euclidean domain. I know that for quadratic fields, some rings of integers are Euclidean, and others are not. For example, \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) (Gaussian integers) and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]\) are Euclidean, but others like \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]\) are not even UFDs.

But since 13 is a positive square-free integer, we&#x27;re dealing with a real quadratic field. Now, the question is whether its ring of integers is Euclidean with respect to the norm. Sometimes real quadratic fields are Euclidean, sometimes not. I remember that for small discriminants, like 5, 8, 12, etc., some are Euclidean. But I need to check specifically for 13.

Wait, let me recall: The Minkowski bound for the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) can be used to check whether it is a PID. If the class number is 1, then it is a PID. Now, Euclidean domains are PIDs, but not all PIDs are Euclidean. So even if the class number is 1, it might not be Euclidean. But for some quadratic fields, it&#x27;s known whether they are Euclidean.

Looking up my memory, I think that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) has class number 1. Let me verify that. For real quadratic fields, the class number is more complicated, but I recall that 13 is a prime where the class number is 1. Wait, primes like 5, 13, 17... Hmm, I need to be careful. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\) has class number 1, but \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{10})\) does not. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall specific results. According to what I remember, the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed a PID, hence has class number 1. But is it Euclidean? Some references say that for real quadratic fields, Euclideanity is known for certain cases. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7})\), and some others are Euclidean with respect to the norm. However, for 13, I need to check.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: A real quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is norm-Euclidean if and only if \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, 73\). Wait, but I might be mixing up different sources. Let me verify.

Actually, according to some references, the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields are those with \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37,\) and \( 73\). So 13 is included here. Wait, but I need to check if this is accurate.

Alternatively, I can check specific literature. For example, in the case of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), the ring of integers is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\), which is the same as our ring. Now, according to some sources, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is norm-Euclidean. Let me recall that the norm in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is given by \(N(a + b\sqrt{d}) = a^2 - db^2\). But in our case, since the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) where \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the norm would be \(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;)\), where \(\theta&#x27;\) is the conjugate of \(\theta\). Since \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the conjugate is \(\theta&#x27; = \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}\). So expanding the norm:

\(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;) = a^2 + ab(\theta + \theta&#x27;) + b^2 \theta \theta&#x27;\).

We know from the minimal polynomial that \(\theta + \theta&#x27; = 1\) (since the coefficient of \(x\) in \(x^2 - x - 3\) is -1, so sum of roots is 1) and \(\theta \theta&#x27; = -3\) (the constant term). Therefore:

\(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab(1) + b^2(-3) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\).

So the norm here is \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). For the ring to be Euclidean, given any elements \(a\) and \(b\) in the ring (\(b \neq 0\)), there should exist \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\).

So to prove it&#x27;s Euclidean, we need to show that for any \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exists \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\).

Alternatively, this can sometimes be approached by showing that for any element \(\alpha / \beta\) in \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists an element \(\gamma\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\alpha/\beta - \gamma) &lt; 1\). This is equivalent to the ring being Euclidean, as the norm is multiplicative.

So, let me think about this. For any element \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), we need to find \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

Since \(\xi\) can be written as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\), we need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) by integers such that the norm of \((x - a) + (y - b)\theta\) is less than 1.

Let me write \(\xi = s + t\theta\), where \(s, t \in \mathbb{Q}\). Then, the norm of \(\xi - \gamma\) where \(\gamma = a + b\theta\) is:

\(N((s - a) + (t - b)\theta) = (s - a)^2 + (s - a)(t - b) - 3(t - b)^2\).

We need this to be less than 1.

To ensure this, we need to find integers \(a, b\) such that \(|s - a|\) and \(|t - b|\) are small enough such that the above expression is less than 1.

Alternatively, since \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is a lattice in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), the problem reduces to covering the plane with regions around each lattice point such that every point in the plane is within a distance less than 1 (in the norm) from some lattice point. If such a covering is possible, then the ring is Euclidean.

But visualizing this for the norm \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\) might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can use the geometry of numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I can check known results. If \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is known to be norm-Euclidean, then the answer is yes. Let me check my memory again. I recall that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed one of the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields. For example, according to the book &quot;Introductory Algebraic Number Theory&quot; by Alaca and Williams, the list of norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields includes those with discriminant 5, 8, 12, 13, 17, 21, 24, 28, 29, 33, 37, etc. So 13 is included. Therefore, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But to be thorough, let me attempt to outline why \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is Euclidean. Let&#x27;s consider the norm function \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). Suppose we have two elements \(\alpha, \beta \neq 0\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), and we want to divide \(\alpha\) by \(\beta\).

Compute \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Express \(\xi\) as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\). We need to find \(q = m + n\theta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Let \(x = m + \delta\) and \(y = n + \epsilon\), where \(m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(\delta, \epsilon \in (-1/2, 1/2]\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = (\delta + \epsilon \theta)^2 + (\delta + \epsilon \theta)(\epsilon) - 3\epsilon^2\).

Wait, maybe this approach isn&#x27;t straightforward. Let&#x27;s instead compute the norm directly:

\(N(\xi - q) = (x - m)^2 + (x - m)(y - n) - 3(y - n)^2\).

Let me set \(u = x - m\) and \(v = y - n\), so \(|u| \leq 1/2\) and \(|v| \leq 1/2\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

We need to show that this is less than 1 for some choice of \(m, n\) such that \(|u|, |v| \leq 1/2\).

Wait, but actually, \(u\) and \(v\) can be in the interval \((-1/2, 1/2]\), so we need to check the maximum possible value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) over that square.

But let me compute the maximum value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) for \(u, v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

To find the maximum, we can take partial derivatives. Let \(f(u, v) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

Compute \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = 2u + v\), and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = u - 6v\).

Setting the derivatives to zero:

1. \(2u + v = 0\)
2. \(u - 6v = 0\)

From the second equation: \(u = 6v\). Plugging into the first equation: \(2(6v) + v = 0 \implies 13v = 0 \implies v = 0\). Then \(u = 0\). So the critical point is at (0, 0), which is a minimum? Wait, check the second derivatives.

The Hessian matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; -6
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant is (2)(-6) - (1)(1) = -12 - 1 = -13 &lt; 0. So the critical point at (0,0) is a saddle point. Therefore, the maximum of \(f(u, v)\) on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) occurs on the boundary.

So let&#x27;s check the boundaries.

Case 1: \(u = 1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

Then, \(f(1/2, v) = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 + (1/2)v - 3v^2\).

This is a quadratic in v. The maximum occurs either at the vertex or endpoints.

Vertex at \(v = -b/(2a)\). Here, a = -3, b = 1/2.

So vertex at \(v = -(1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/6 = 1/12\). Within the interval [-1/2, 1/2].

Compute f(1/2, 1/12) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/12) - 3*(1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Convert to 48 denominators:

12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Compute endpoints:

At v = -1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3*(1/4) = 0 - 3/4 = -3/4.

At v = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum on this edge is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Case 2: \(u = -1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(-1/2, v) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 - (1/2)v - 3v^2.

Again, quadratic in v with a = -3, b = -1/2.

Vertex at v = -(-1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/(-6) = -1/12.

Compute f(-1/2, -1/12) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/12) - 3*(-1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Same as before, 12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

At endpoints:

v = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

v = 1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum here is 13/48.

Case 3: \(v = 1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, 1/2) = u^2 + u*(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = u^2 + u/2 - 3/4.

This is quadratic in u, opening upwards. The vertex is at u = -b/(2a) = -(1/2)/(2*1) = -1/4.

Compute f(-1/4, 1/2) = (-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

At endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = -1/4 as before.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum on this edge is -1/4, which is not higher than previous maxima.

Case 4: \(v = -1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, -1/2) = u^2 + u*(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = u^2 - u/2 - 3/4.

Quadratic in u, vertex at u = (1/2)/(2*1) = 1/4.

Compute f(1/4, -1/2) = (1/4)^2 - (1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

Endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = -3/4.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = (-1/2)^2 - (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum here is -1/4.

Case 5: Edges where u or v is fixed at 1/2 or -1/2, but we already covered all edges.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(N(\xi - q)\) over the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708, which is less than 1. Therefore, for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\). Hence, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is norm-Euclidean.

Wait, hold on. If the maximum of \(N(\xi - q)\) is 13/48 which is approximately 0.27, which is definitely less than 1. Therefore, this would imply that the norm is a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring is Euclidean.

But wait, this seems conflicting with my initial uncertainty, but according to the calculation, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain is less than 1, it is Euclidean. Therefore, the answer should be yes, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have two elements in the ring, say \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), and try to divide them. Let&#x27;s take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = 2\). Then, \(\xi = \theta / 2 = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4\). So we need to find \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Express \(\xi\) as \(0 + (1/4)\theta\). So \(x = 0\), \(y = 1/4\). We need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) with integers \(m\) and \(n\). The closest integers to \(x = 0\) is \(m = 0\), and to \(y = 1/4\) is \(n = 0\) or \(n = 1\). Let&#x27;s check both:

If \(n = 0\), then \(q = 0 + 0\theta = 0\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi\), and \(N(\xi) = (0)^2 + (0)(1/4) - 3*(1/4)^2 = -3/16\). The norm is negative, but in absolute value, 3/16, which is less than 1.

But wait, the norm can be negative here? The norm in a real quadratic field is \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\), which can indeed be negative. However, when we talk about the Euclidean function, we usually take the absolute value of the norm. So in this case, |N(\xi - q)| = 3/16 &lt; 1. So this works.

Alternatively, if we take \(n = 1\), then \(q = 0 + 1\theta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi - \theta = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4 - (1 + \sqrt{13})/2 = (-1 - \sqrt{13})/4\). Then, N(\xi - q) = [(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta] has norm:

Let me compute it:

(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta = -1/4 - (1/4)\theta. The norm is:

(-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(-1/4) - 3*(-1/4)^2 = 1/16 + 1/16 - 3/16 = (1 + 1 - 3)/16 = (-1)/16. Absolute value is 1/16, which is even smaller. So either way, the norm is less than 1. Therefore, in this case, we can write \(\theta = 2*0 + r\) where \(N(r) = 3/16 &lt; N(2) = 4\), but actually, in the division, since we are allowed to choose any q, even if the norm is negative, as long as the absolute value is less than N(b). Wait, but in the division algorithm, the remainder can have norm less than that of beta. However, in this case, the norm of beta is N(2) = 4. The remainder here has norm |N(r)| = 3/16, which is less than 4. But actually, in the standard division algorithm, we have \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\). However, in the case of negative norms, perhaps we need to take the absolute value? Wait, the norm here is actually the field norm, which can be positive or negative. But in the context of Euclidean domains, the Euclidean function is usually taken to be the absolute value of the norm.

Wait, but in the case of the Gaussian integers, the norm is always non-negative, so it&#x27;s clear. In real quadratic fields, the norm can be negative, but since we need the Euclidean function to map to non-negative integers, we take the absolute value. Therefore, the Euclidean function here is |N(a)|. Therefore, when we say \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\), it&#x27;s actually |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So even if r has a negative norm, as long as its absolute value is less than |N(b)|, it&#x27;s okay.

But in our calculation above, when we approximated \(\xi = \theta / 2\) by q = 0, we got |N(\(\xi - 0\))| = 3/16 &lt; |N(2)| = 4. Wait, but 3/16 is much less than 4. However, in the division algorithm, we need |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So in this case, 3/16 &lt; 4, so it&#x27;s fine. Therefore, the division works.

Another example: take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, dividing \(\theta\) by \(\theta\), we get \(\xi = 1\), which is already in the ring, so the remainder is 0.

Alternatively, take \(\alpha = 1 + \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi = (1 + \theta)/\theta = 1/\theta + 1\). Since \(\theta\) satisfies \(\theta^2 = \theta + 3\), so \(1/\theta = (\theta - 1)/3\). Therefore, \(\xi = (\theta - 1)/3 + 1 = (theta - 1 + 3)/3 = (theta + 2)/3. So approximate this by some q in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\). Let me compute the numerical values.

theta = (1 + sqrt(13))/2 ≈ (1 + 3.6055)/2 ≈ 4.6055/2 ≈ 2.30275.

So xi = (theta + 2)/3 ≈ (2.30275 + 2)/3 ≈ 4.30275/3 ≈ 1.43425.

So in terms of the basis {1, theta}, xi is approximately 1.43425. So express this as x + y theta, where x and y are rational numbers. Wait, but xi = (theta + 2)/3, which is (2)/3 + (1)/3 theta. So x = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 and y = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333. So we need to approximate x and y with integers m and n. The closest integers to x = 2/3 is m = 1 or 0. If we take m = 1, then n should be 0 or 1? Wait, y = 1/3. The closest integer to 1/3 is 0. So maybe take m = 1, n = 0. Then, q = 1 + 0*theta = 1. Then, the remainder is xi - q = (2/3 - 1) + (1/3 - 0) theta = (-1/3) + (1/3) theta. The norm of this is:

N(-1/3 + (1/3)theta) = (-1/3)^2 + (-1/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 1/9 - 1/9 - 3/9 = (-3)/9 = -1/3. Absolute value is 1/3, which is less than |N(beta)| = |N(theta)| = |1^2 + 1*1 - 3*1^2| = |1 + 1 - 3| = |-1| = 1. So 1/3 &lt; 1, which works. Therefore, the remainder has norm less than that of beta, so the division works.

Alternatively, if we choose m = 0 and n = 0, then q = 0. The remainder is xi - 0 = xi, whose norm is:

N(2/3 + (1/3)theta) = (2/3)^2 + (2/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 4/9 + 2/9 - 3/9 = (4 + 2 - 3)/9 = 3/9 = 1/3. Absolute value 1/3 &lt; 1. So either way, we get a remainder with smaller norm.

Therefore, these examples support the conclusion that the ring is Euclidean.

Additionally, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain was found to be 13/48 ≈ 0.27, which is less than 1, this implies that the ring is indeed norm-Euclidean.

Therefore, after this thorough check, I can conclude that \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain, we start by noting that this ring is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). The element \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\) is an algebraic integer with minimal polynomial \(x^2 - x - 3\), which confirms that \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is indeed the ring of integers.

A key property of Euclidean domains is the existence of a Euclidean function, typically the absolute value of the norm in quadratic fields. For the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), the norm of an element \(a + b\theta\) is given by \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). 

To verify the Euclidean property, we need to show that for any elements \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exist \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\). This is equivalent to showing that for any \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

By analyzing the norm function and checking the maximum value of \(N(\xi - \gamma)\) over the fundamental domain, we find that the maximum norm on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is \(\frac{13}{48}\), which is less than 1. This ensures that for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that the norm of the remainder is less than the norm of \(\beta\).

Examples and calculations confirm that the division algorithm holds, and the norm function serves as a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain. Hmm, let&#x27;s start by recalling some definitions. A Euclidean domain is an integral domain where we can perform the Euclidean algorithm, which basically means there&#x27;s a way to measure the &quot;size&quot; of elements (called a Euclidean function) such that for any two elements \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b \neq 0\)), there exist \(q\) and \(r\) where \(a = bq + r\) and either \(r = 0\) or the size of \(r\) is less than the size of \(b\).

First, let me make sure I understand the ring in question. The ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) consists of all numbers of the form \(a + b\left(\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers. Let me simplify that expression a bit. Let me denote \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\). So the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\).

I know that \(\theta\) is a root of a quadratic equation. Let me find its minimal polynomial. If \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\), then multiplying both sides by 2 gives \(2\theta = \sqrt{13} + 1\). Rearranging, \(\sqrt{13} = 2\theta - 1\). Squaring both sides, \(13 = (2\theta - 1)^2 = 4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1\). Then, moving everything to one side: \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1 - 13 = 0\), so \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta - 12 = 0\). Dividing both sides by 4: \(\theta^2 - \theta - 3 = 0\). So the minimal polynomial is \(x^2 - x - 3\). Therefore, \(\theta\) is an algebraic integer of degree 2, which means \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Wait, hold on. The ring of integers in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is typically \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{d}}{2}\right]\) when \(d \equiv 1 \mod 4\), and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]\) otherwise. Here, \(d = 13\), which is 1 mod 4, so the ring of integers should be \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). But in our case, the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\), which is the same as \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). So actually, this ring is the full ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Therefore, we are dealing with the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Now, I need to recall whether this ring is a Euclidean domain. I know that for quadratic fields, some rings of integers are Euclidean, and others are not. For example, \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) (Gaussian integers) and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]\) are Euclidean, but others like \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]\) are not even UFDs.

But since 13 is a positive square-free integer, we&#x27;re dealing with a real quadratic field. Now, the question is whether its ring of integers is Euclidean with respect to the norm. Sometimes real quadratic fields are Euclidean, sometimes not. I remember that for small discriminants, like 5, 8, 12, etc., some are Euclidean. But I need to check specifically for 13.

Wait, let me recall: The Minkowski bound for the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) can be used to check whether it is a PID. If the class number is 1, then it is a PID. Now, Euclidean domains are PIDs, but not all PIDs are Euclidean. So even if the class number is 1, it might not be Euclidean. But for some quadratic fields, it&#x27;s known whether they are Euclidean.

Looking up my memory, I think that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) has class number 1. Let me verify that. For real quadratic fields, the class number is more complicated, but I recall that 13 is a prime where the class number is 1. Wait, primes like 5, 13, 17... Hmm, I need to be careful. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\) has class number 1, but \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{10})\) does not. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall specific results. According to what I remember, the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed a PID, hence has class number 1. But is it Euclidean? Some references say that for real quadratic fields, Euclideanity is known for certain cases. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7})\), and some others are Euclidean with respect to the norm. However, for 13, I need to check.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: A real quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is norm-Euclidean if and only if \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, 73\). Wait, but I might be mixing up different sources. Let me verify.

Actually, according to some references, the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields are those with \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37,\) and \( 73\). So 13 is included here. Wait, but I need to check if this is accurate.

Alternatively, I can check specific literature. For example, in the case of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), the ring of integers is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\), which is the same as our ring. Now, according to some sources, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is norm-Euclidean. Let me recall that the norm in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is given by \(N(a + b\sqrt{d}) = a^2 - db^2\). But in our case, since the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) where \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the norm would be \(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;)\), where \(\theta&#x27;\) is the conjugate of \(\theta\). Since \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the conjugate is \(\theta&#x27; = \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}\). So expanding the norm:

\(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;) = a^2 + ab(\theta + \theta&#x27;) + b^2 \theta \theta&#x27;\).

We know from the minimal polynomial that \(\theta + \theta&#x27; = 1\) (since the coefficient of \(x\) in \(x^2 - x - 3\) is -1, so sum of roots is 1) and \(\theta \theta&#x27; = -3\) (the constant term). Therefore:

\(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab(1) + b^2(-3) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\).

So the norm here is \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). For the ring to be Euclidean, given any elements \(a\) and \(b\) in the ring (\(b \neq 0\)), there should exist \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\).

So to prove it&#x27;s Euclidean, we need to show that for any \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exists \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\).

Alternatively, this can sometimes be approached by showing that for any element \(\alpha / \beta\) in \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists an element \(\gamma\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\alpha/\beta - \gamma) &lt; 1\). This is equivalent to the ring being Euclidean, as the norm is multiplicative.

So, let me think about this. For any element \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), we need to find \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

Since \(\xi\) can be written as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\), we need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) by integers such that the norm of \((x - a) + (y - b)\theta\) is less than 1.

Let me write \(\xi = s + t\theta\), where \(s, t \in \mathbb{Q}\). Then, the norm of \(\xi - \gamma\) where \(\gamma = a + b\theta\) is:

\(N((s - a) + (t - b)\theta) = (s - a)^2 + (s - a)(t - b) - 3(t - b)^2\).

We need this to be less than 1.

To ensure this, we need to find integers \(a, b\) such that \(|s - a|\) and \(|t - b|\) are small enough such that the above expression is less than 1.

Alternatively, since \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is a lattice in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), the problem reduces to covering the plane with regions around each lattice point such that every point in the plane is within a distance less than 1 (in the norm) from some lattice point. If such a covering is possible, then the ring is Euclidean.

But visualizing this for the norm \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\) might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can use the geometry of numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I can check known results. If \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is known to be norm-Euclidean, then the answer is yes. Let me check my memory again. I recall that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed one of the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields. For example, according to the book &quot;Introductory Algebraic Number Theory&quot; by Alaca and Williams, the list of norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields includes those with discriminant 5, 8, 12, 13, 17, 21, 24, 28, 29, 33, 37, etc. So 13 is included. Therefore, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But to be thorough, let me attempt to outline why \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is Euclidean. Let&#x27;s consider the norm function \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). Suppose we have two elements \(\alpha, \beta \neq 0\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), and we want to divide \(\alpha\) by \(\beta\).

Compute \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Express \(\xi\) as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\). We need to find \(q = m + n\theta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Let \(x = m + \delta\) and \(y = n + \epsilon\), where \(m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(\delta, \epsilon \in (-1/2, 1/2]\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = (\delta + \epsilon \theta)^2 + (\delta + \epsilon \theta)(\epsilon) - 3\epsilon^2\).

Wait, maybe this approach isn&#x27;t straightforward. Let&#x27;s instead compute the norm directly:

\(N(\xi - q) = (x - m)^2 + (x - m)(y - n) - 3(y - n)^2\).

Let me set \(u = x - m\) and \(v = y - n\), so \(|u| \leq 1/2\) and \(|v| \leq 1/2\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

We need to show that this is less than 1 for some choice of \(m, n\) such that \(|u|, |v| \leq 1/2\).

Wait, but actually, \(u\) and \(v\) can be in the interval \((-1/2, 1/2]\), so we need to check the maximum possible value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) over that square.

But let me compute the maximum value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) for \(u, v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

To find the maximum, we can take partial derivatives. Let \(f(u, v) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

Compute \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = 2u + v\), and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = u - 6v\).

Setting the derivatives to zero:

1. \(2u + v = 0\)
2. \(u - 6v = 0\)

From the second equation: \(u = 6v\). Plugging into the first equation: \(2(6v) + v = 0 \implies 13v = 0 \implies v = 0\). Then \(u = 0\). So the critical point is at (0, 0), which is a minimum? Wait, check the second derivatives.

The Hessian matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; -6
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant is (2)(-6) - (1)(1) = -12 - 1 = -13 &lt; 0. So the critical point at (0,0) is a saddle point. Therefore, the maximum of \(f(u, v)\) on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) occurs on the boundary.

So let&#x27;s check the boundaries.

Case 1: \(u = 1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

Then, \(f(1/2, v) = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 + (1/2)v - 3v^2\).

This is a quadratic in v. The maximum occurs either at the vertex or endpoints.

Vertex at \(v = -b/(2a)\). Here, a = -3, b = 1/2.

So vertex at \(v = -(1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/6 = 1/12\). Within the interval [-1/2, 1/2].

Compute f(1/2, 1/12) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/12) - 3*(1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Convert to 48 denominators:

12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Compute endpoints:

At v = -1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3*(1/4) = 0 - 3/4 = -3/4.

At v = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum on this edge is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Case 2: \(u = -1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(-1/2, v) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 - (1/2)v - 3v^2.

Again, quadratic in v with a = -3, b = -1/2.

Vertex at v = -(-1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/(-6) = -1/12.

Compute f(-1/2, -1/12) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/12) - 3*(-1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Same as before, 12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

At endpoints:

v = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

v = 1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum here is 13/48.

Case 3: \(v = 1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, 1/2) = u^2 + u*(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = u^2 + u/2 - 3/4.

This is quadratic in u, opening upwards. The vertex is at u = -b/(2a) = -(1/2)/(2*1) = -1/4.

Compute f(-1/4, 1/2) = (-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

At endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = -1/4 as before.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum on this edge is -1/4, which is not higher than previous maxima.

Case 4: \(v = -1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, -1/2) = u^2 + u*(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = u^2 - u/2 - 3/4.

Quadratic in u, vertex at u = (1/2)/(2*1) = 1/4.

Compute f(1/4, -1/2) = (1/4)^2 - (1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

Endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = -3/4.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = (-1/2)^2 - (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum here is -1/4.

Case 5: Edges where u or v is fixed at 1/2 or -1/2, but we already covered all edges.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(N(\xi - q)\) over the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708, which is less than 1. Therefore, for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\). Hence, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is norm-Euclidean.

Wait, hold on. If the maximum of \(N(\xi - q)\) is 13/48 which is approximately 0.27, which is definitely less than 1. Therefore, this would imply that the norm is a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring is Euclidean.

But wait, this seems conflicting with my initial uncertainty, but according to the calculation, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain is less than 1, it is Euclidean. Therefore, the answer should be yes, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have two elements in the ring, say \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), and try to divide them. Let&#x27;s take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = 2\). Then, \(\xi = \theta / 2 = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4\). So we need to find \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Express \(\xi\) as \(0 + (1/4)\theta\). So \(x = 0\), \(y = 1/4\). We need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) with integers \(m\) and \(n\). The closest integers to \(x = 0\) is \(m = 0\), and to \(y = 1/4\) is \(n = 0\) or \(n = 1\). Let&#x27;s check both:

If \(n = 0\), then \(q = 0 + 0\theta = 0\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi\), and \(N(\xi) = (0)^2 + (0)(1/4) - 3*(1/4)^2 = -3/16\). The norm is negative, but in absolute value, 3/16, which is less than 1.

But wait, the norm can be negative here? The norm in a real quadratic field is \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\), which can indeed be negative. However, when we talk about the Euclidean function, we usually take the absolute value of the norm. So in this case, |N(\xi - q)| = 3/16 &lt; 1. So this works.

Alternatively, if we take \(n = 1\), then \(q = 0 + 1\theta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi - \theta = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4 - (1 + \sqrt{13})/2 = (-1 - \sqrt{13})/4\). Then, N(\xi - q) = [(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta] has norm:

Let me compute it:

(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta = -1/4 - (1/4)\theta. The norm is:

(-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(-1/4) - 3*(-1/4)^2 = 1/16 + 1/16 - 3/16 = (1 + 1 - 3)/16 = (-1)/16. Absolute value is 1/16, which is even smaller. So either way, the norm is less than 1. Therefore, in this case, we can write \(\theta = 2*0 + r\) where \(N(r) = 3/16 &lt; N(2) = 4\), but actually, in the division, since we are allowed to choose any q, even if the norm is negative, as long as the absolute value is less than N(b). Wait, but in the division algorithm, the remainder can have norm less than that of beta. However, in this case, the norm of beta is N(2) = 4. The remainder here has norm |N(r)| = 3/16, which is less than 4. But actually, in the standard division algorithm, we have \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\). However, in the case of negative norms, perhaps we need to take the absolute value? Wait, the norm here is actually the field norm, which can be positive or negative. But in the context of Euclidean domains, the Euclidean function is usually taken to be the absolute value of the norm.

Wait, but in the case of the Gaussian integers, the norm is always non-negative, so it&#x27;s clear. In real quadratic fields, the norm can be negative, but since we need the Euclidean function to map to non-negative integers, we take the absolute value. Therefore, the Euclidean function here is |N(a)|. Therefore, when we say \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\), it&#x27;s actually |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So even if r has a negative norm, as long as its absolute value is less than |N(b)|, it&#x27;s okay.

But in our calculation above, when we approximated \(\xi = \theta / 2\) by q = 0, we got |N(\(\xi - 0\))| = 3/16 &lt; |N(2)| = 4. Wait, but 3/16 is much less than 4. However, in the division algorithm, we need |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So in this case, 3/16 &lt; 4, so it&#x27;s fine. Therefore, the division works.

Another example: take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, dividing \(\theta\) by \(\theta\), we get \(\xi = 1\), which is already in the ring, so the remainder is 0.

Alternatively, take \(\alpha = 1 + \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi = (1 + \theta)/\theta = 1/\theta + 1\). Since \(\theta\) satisfies \(\theta^2 = \theta + 3\), so \(1/\theta = (\theta - 1)/3\). Therefore, \(\xi = (\theta - 1)/3 + 1 = (theta - 1 + 3)/3 = (theta + 2)/3. So approximate this by some q in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\). Let me compute the numerical values.

theta = (1 + sqrt(13))/2 ≈ (1 + 3.6055)/2 ≈ 4.6055/2 ≈ 2.30275.

So xi = (theta + 2)/3 ≈ (2.30275 + 2)/3 ≈ 4.30275/3 ≈ 1.43425.

So in terms of the basis {1, theta}, xi is approximately 1.43425. So express this as x + y theta, where x and y are rational numbers. Wait, but xi = (theta + 2)/3, which is (2)/3 + (1)/3 theta. So x = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 and y = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333. So we need to approximate x and y with integers m and n. The closest integers to x = 2/3 is m = 1 or 0. If we take m = 1, then n should be 0 or 1? Wait, y = 1/3. The closest integer to 1/3 is 0. So maybe take m = 1, n = 0. Then, q = 1 + 0*theta = 1. Then, the remainder is xi - q = (2/3 - 1) + (1/3 - 0) theta = (-1/3) + (1/3) theta. The norm of this is:

N(-1/3 + (1/3)theta) = (-1/3)^2 + (-1/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 1/9 - 1/9 - 3/9 = (-3)/9 = -1/3. Absolute value is 1/3, which is less than |N(beta)| = |N(theta)| = |1^2 + 1*1 - 3*1^2| = |1 + 1 - 3| = |-1| = 1. So 1/3 &lt; 1, which works. Therefore, the remainder has norm less than that of beta, so the division works.

Alternatively, if we choose m = 0 and n = 0, then q = 0. The remainder is xi - 0 = xi, whose norm is:

N(2/3 + (1/3)theta) = (2/3)^2 + (2/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 4/9 + 2/9 - 3/9 = (4 + 2 - 3)/9 = 3/9 = 1/3. Absolute value 1/3 &lt; 1. So either way, we get a remainder with smaller norm.

Therefore, these examples support the conclusion that the ring is Euclidean.

Additionally, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain was found to be 13/48 ≈ 0.27, which is less than 1, this implies that the ring is indeed norm-Euclidean.

Therefore, after this thorough check, I can conclude that \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain, we start by noting that this ring is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). The element \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\) is an algebraic integer with minimal polynomial \(x^2 - x - 3\), which confirms that \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is indeed the ring of integers.

A key property of Euclidean domains is the existence of a Euclidean function, typically the absolute value of the norm in quadratic fields. For the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), the norm of an element \(a + b\theta\) is given by \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). 

To verify the Euclidean property, we need to show that for any elements \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exist \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\). This is equivalent to showing that for any \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

By analyzing the norm function and checking the maximum value of \(N(\xi - \gamma)\) over the fundamental domain, we find that the maximum norm on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is \(\frac{13}{48}\), which is less than 1. This ensures that for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that the norm of the remainder is less than the norm of \(\beta\).

Examples and calculations confirm that the division algorithm holds, and the norm function serves as a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain. Hmm, let&#x27;s start by recalling some definitions. A Euclidean domain is an integral domain where we can perform the Euclidean algorithm, which basically means there&#x27;s a way to measure the &quot;size&quot; of elements (called a Euclidean function) such that for any two elements \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b \neq 0\)), there exist \(q\) and \(r\) where \(a = bq + r\) and either \(r = 0\) or the size of \(r\) is less than the size of \(b\).

First, let me make sure I understand the ring in question. The ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) consists of all numbers of the form \(a + b\left(\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers. Let me simplify that expression a bit. Let me denote \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\). So the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\).

I know that \(\theta\) is a root of a quadratic equation. Let me find its minimal polynomial. If \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\), then multiplying both sides by 2 gives \(2\theta = \sqrt{13} + 1\). Rearranging, \(\sqrt{13} = 2\theta - 1\). Squaring both sides, \(13 = (2\theta - 1)^2 = 4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1\). Then, moving everything to one side: \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1 - 13 = 0\), so \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta - 12 = 0\). Dividing both sides by 4: \(\theta^2 - \theta - 3 = 0\). So the minimal polynomial is \(x^2 - x - 3\). Therefore, \(\theta\) is an algebraic integer of degree 2, which means \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Wait, hold on. The ring of integers in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is typically \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{d}}{2}\right]\) when \(d \equiv 1 \mod 4\), and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]\) otherwise. Here, \(d = 13\), which is 1 mod 4, so the ring of integers should be \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). But in our case, the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\), which is the same as \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). So actually, this ring is the full ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Therefore, we are dealing with the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Now, I need to recall whether this ring is a Euclidean domain. I know that for quadratic fields, some rings of integers are Euclidean, and others are not. For example, \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) (Gaussian integers) and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]\) are Euclidean, but others like \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]\) are not even UFDs.

But since 13 is a positive square-free integer, we&#x27;re dealing with a real quadratic field. Now, the question is whether its ring of integers is Euclidean with respect to the norm. Sometimes real quadratic fields are Euclidean, sometimes not. I remember that for small discriminants, like 5, 8, 12, etc., some are Euclidean. But I need to check specifically for 13.

Wait, let me recall: The Minkowski bound for the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) can be used to check whether it is a PID. If the class number is 1, then it is a PID. Now, Euclidean domains are PIDs, but not all PIDs are Euclidean. So even if the class number is 1, it might not be Euclidean. But for some quadratic fields, it&#x27;s known whether they are Euclidean.

Looking up my memory, I think that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) has class number 1. Let me verify that. For real quadratic fields, the class number is more complicated, but I recall that 13 is a prime where the class number is 1. Wait, primes like 5, 13, 17... Hmm, I need to be careful. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\) has class number 1, but \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{10})\) does not. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall specific results. According to what I remember, the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed a PID, hence has class number 1. But is it Euclidean? Some references say that for real quadratic fields, Euclideanity is known for certain cases. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7})\), and some others are Euclidean with respect to the norm. However, for 13, I need to check.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: A real quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is norm-Euclidean if and only if \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, 73\). Wait, but I might be mixing up different sources. Let me verify.

Actually, according to some references, the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields are those with \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37,\) and \( 73\). So 13 is included here. Wait, but I need to check if this is accurate.

Alternatively, I can check specific literature. For example, in the case of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), the ring of integers is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\), which is the same as our ring. Now, according to some sources, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is norm-Euclidean. Let me recall that the norm in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is given by \(N(a + b\sqrt{d}) = a^2 - db^2\). But in our case, since the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) where \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the norm would be \(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;)\), where \(\theta&#x27;\) is the conjugate of \(\theta\). Since \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the conjugate is \(\theta&#x27; = \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}\). So expanding the norm:

\(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;) = a^2 + ab(\theta + \theta&#x27;) + b^2 \theta \theta&#x27;\).

We know from the minimal polynomial that \(\theta + \theta&#x27; = 1\) (since the coefficient of \(x\) in \(x^2 - x - 3\) is -1, so sum of roots is 1) and \(\theta \theta&#x27; = -3\) (the constant term). Therefore:

\(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab(1) + b^2(-3) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\).

So the norm here is \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). For the ring to be Euclidean, given any elements \(a\) and \(b\) in the ring (\(b \neq 0\)), there should exist \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\).

So to prove it&#x27;s Euclidean, we need to show that for any \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exists \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\).

Alternatively, this can sometimes be approached by showing that for any element \(\alpha / \beta\) in \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists an element \(\gamma\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\alpha/\beta - \gamma) &lt; 1\). This is equivalent to the ring being Euclidean, as the norm is multiplicative.

So, let me think about this. For any element \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), we need to find \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

Since \(\xi\) can be written as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\), we need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) by integers such that the norm of \((x - a) + (y - b)\theta\) is less than 1.

Let me write \(\xi = s + t\theta\), where \(s, t \in \mathbb{Q}\). Then, the norm of \(\xi - \gamma\) where \(\gamma = a + b\theta\) is:

\(N((s - a) + (t - b)\theta) = (s - a)^2 + (s - a)(t - b) - 3(t - b)^2\).

We need this to be less than 1.

To ensure this, we need to find integers \(a, b\) such that \(|s - a|\) and \(|t - b|\) are small enough such that the above expression is less than 1.

Alternatively, since \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is a lattice in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), the problem reduces to covering the plane with regions around each lattice point such that every point in the plane is within a distance less than 1 (in the norm) from some lattice point. If such a covering is possible, then the ring is Euclidean.

But visualizing this for the norm \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\) might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can use the geometry of numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I can check known results. If \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is known to be norm-Euclidean, then the answer is yes. Let me check my memory again. I recall that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed one of the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields. For example, according to the book &quot;Introductory Algebraic Number Theory&quot; by Alaca and Williams, the list of norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields includes those with discriminant 5, 8, 12, 13, 17, 21, 24, 28, 29, 33, 37, etc. So 13 is included. Therefore, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But to be thorough, let me attempt to outline why \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is Euclidean. Let&#x27;s consider the norm function \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). Suppose we have two elements \(\alpha, \beta \neq 0\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), and we want to divide \(\alpha\) by \(\beta\).

Compute \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Express \(\xi\) as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\). We need to find \(q = m + n\theta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Let \(x = m + \delta\) and \(y = n + \epsilon\), where \(m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(\delta, \epsilon \in (-1/2, 1/2]\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = (\delta + \epsilon \theta)^2 + (\delta + \epsilon \theta)(\epsilon) - 3\epsilon^2\).

Wait, maybe this approach isn&#x27;t straightforward. Let&#x27;s instead compute the norm directly:

\(N(\xi - q) = (x - m)^2 + (x - m)(y - n) - 3(y - n)^2\).

Let me set \(u = x - m\) and \(v = y - n\), so \(|u| \leq 1/2\) and \(|v| \leq 1/2\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

We need to show that this is less than 1 for some choice of \(m, n\) such that \(|u|, |v| \leq 1/2\).

Wait, but actually, \(u\) and \(v\) can be in the interval \((-1/2, 1/2]\), so we need to check the maximum possible value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) over that square.

But let me compute the maximum value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) for \(u, v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

To find the maximum, we can take partial derivatives. Let \(f(u, v) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

Compute \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = 2u + v\), and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = u - 6v\).

Setting the derivatives to zero:

1. \(2u + v = 0\)
2. \(u - 6v = 0\)

From the second equation: \(u = 6v\). Plugging into the first equation: \(2(6v) + v = 0 \implies 13v = 0 \implies v = 0\). Then \(u = 0\). So the critical point is at (0, 0), which is a minimum? Wait, check the second derivatives.

The Hessian matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; -6
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant is (2)(-6) - (1)(1) = -12 - 1 = -13 &lt; 0. So the critical point at (0,0) is a saddle point. Therefore, the maximum of \(f(u, v)\) on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) occurs on the boundary.

So let&#x27;s check the boundaries.

Case 1: \(u = 1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

Then, \(f(1/2, v) = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 + (1/2)v - 3v^2\).

This is a quadratic in v. The maximum occurs either at the vertex or endpoints.

Vertex at \(v = -b/(2a)\). Here, a = -3, b = 1/2.

So vertex at \(v = -(1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/6 = 1/12\). Within the interval [-1/2, 1/2].

Compute f(1/2, 1/12) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/12) - 3*(1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Convert to 48 denominators:

12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Compute endpoints:

At v = -1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3*(1/4) = 0 - 3/4 = -3/4.

At v = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum on this edge is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Case 2: \(u = -1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(-1/2, v) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 - (1/2)v - 3v^2.

Again, quadratic in v with a = -3, b = -1/2.

Vertex at v = -(-1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/(-6) = -1/12.

Compute f(-1/2, -1/12) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/12) - 3*(-1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Same as before, 12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

At endpoints:

v = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

v = 1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum here is 13/48.

Case 3: \(v = 1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, 1/2) = u^2 + u*(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = u^2 + u/2 - 3/4.

This is quadratic in u, opening upwards. The vertex is at u = -b/(2a) = -(1/2)/(2*1) = -1/4.

Compute f(-1/4, 1/2) = (-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

At endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = -1/4 as before.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum on this edge is -1/4, which is not higher than previous maxima.

Case 4: \(v = -1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, -1/2) = u^2 + u*(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = u^2 - u/2 - 3/4.

Quadratic in u, vertex at u = (1/2)/(2*1) = 1/4.

Compute f(1/4, -1/2) = (1/4)^2 - (1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

Endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = -3/4.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = (-1/2)^2 - (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum here is -1/4.

Case 5: Edges where u or v is fixed at 1/2 or -1/2, but we already covered all edges.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(N(\xi - q)\) over the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708, which is less than 1. Therefore, for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\). Hence, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is norm-Euclidean.

Wait, hold on. If the maximum of \(N(\xi - q)\) is 13/48 which is approximately 0.27, which is definitely less than 1. Therefore, this would imply that the norm is a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring is Euclidean.

But wait, this seems conflicting with my initial uncertainty, but according to the calculation, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain is less than 1, it is Euclidean. Therefore, the answer should be yes, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have two elements in the ring, say \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), and try to divide them. Let&#x27;s take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = 2\). Then, \(\xi = \theta / 2 = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4\). So we need to find \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Express \(\xi\) as \(0 + (1/4)\theta\). So \(x = 0\), \(y = 1/4\). We need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) with integers \(m\) and \(n\). The closest integers to \(x = 0\) is \(m = 0\), and to \(y = 1/4\) is \(n = 0\) or \(n = 1\). Let&#x27;s check both:

If \(n = 0\), then \(q = 0 + 0\theta = 0\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi\), and \(N(\xi) = (0)^2 + (0)(1/4) - 3*(1/4)^2 = -3/16\). The norm is negative, but in absolute value, 3/16, which is less than 1.

But wait, the norm can be negative here? The norm in a real quadratic field is \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\), which can indeed be negative. However, when we talk about the Euclidean function, we usually take the absolute value of the norm. So in this case, |N(\xi - q)| = 3/16 &lt; 1. So this works.

Alternatively, if we take \(n = 1\), then \(q = 0 + 1\theta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi - \theta = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4 - (1 + \sqrt{13})/2 = (-1 - \sqrt{13})/4\). Then, N(\xi - q) = [(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta] has norm:

Let me compute it:

(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta = -1/4 - (1/4)\theta. The norm is:

(-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(-1/4) - 3*(-1/4)^2 = 1/16 + 1/16 - 3/16 = (1 + 1 - 3)/16 = (-1)/16. Absolute value is 1/16, which is even smaller. So either way, the norm is less than 1. Therefore, in this case, we can write \(\theta = 2*0 + r\) where \(N(r) = 3/16 &lt; N(2) = 4\), but actually, in the division, since we are allowed to choose any q, even if the norm is negative, as long as the absolute value is less than N(b). Wait, but in the division algorithm, the remainder can have norm less than that of beta. However, in this case, the norm of beta is N(2) = 4. The remainder here has norm |N(r)| = 3/16, which is less than 4. But actually, in the standard division algorithm, we have \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\). However, in the case of negative norms, perhaps we need to take the absolute value? Wait, the norm here is actually the field norm, which can be positive or negative. But in the context of Euclidean domains, the Euclidean function is usually taken to be the absolute value of the norm.

Wait, but in the case of the Gaussian integers, the norm is always non-negative, so it&#x27;s clear. In real quadratic fields, the norm can be negative, but since we need the Euclidean function to map to non-negative integers, we take the absolute value. Therefore, the Euclidean function here is |N(a)|. Therefore, when we say \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\), it&#x27;s actually |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So even if r has a negative norm, as long as its absolute value is less than |N(b)|, it&#x27;s okay.

But in our calculation above, when we approximated \(\xi = \theta / 2\) by q = 0, we got |N(\(\xi - 0\))| = 3/16 &lt; |N(2)| = 4. Wait, but 3/16 is much less than 4. However, in the division algorithm, we need |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So in this case, 3/16 &lt; 4, so it&#x27;s fine. Therefore, the division works.

Another example: take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, dividing \(\theta\) by \(\theta\), we get \(\xi = 1\), which is already in the ring, so the remainder is 0.

Alternatively, take \(\alpha = 1 + \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi = (1 + \theta)/\theta = 1/\theta + 1\). Since \(\theta\) satisfies \(\theta^2 = \theta + 3\), so \(1/\theta = (\theta - 1)/3\). Therefore, \(\xi = (\theta - 1)/3 + 1 = (theta - 1 + 3)/3 = (theta + 2)/3. So approximate this by some q in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\). Let me compute the numerical values.

theta = (1 + sqrt(13))/2 ≈ (1 + 3.6055)/2 ≈ 4.6055/2 ≈ 2.30275.

So xi = (theta + 2)/3 ≈ (2.30275 + 2)/3 ≈ 4.30275/3 ≈ 1.43425.

So in terms of the basis {1, theta}, xi is approximately 1.43425. So express this as x + y theta, where x and y are rational numbers. Wait, but xi = (theta + 2)/3, which is (2)/3 + (1)/3 theta. So x = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 and y = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333. So we need to approximate x and y with integers m and n. The closest integers to x = 2/3 is m = 1 or 0. If we take m = 1, then n should be 0 or 1? Wait, y = 1/3. The closest integer to 1/3 is 0. So maybe take m = 1, n = 0. Then, q = 1 + 0*theta = 1. Then, the remainder is xi - q = (2/3 - 1) + (1/3 - 0) theta = (-1/3) + (1/3) theta. The norm of this is:

N(-1/3 + (1/3)theta) = (-1/3)^2 + (-1/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 1/9 - 1/9 - 3/9 = (-3)/9 = -1/3. Absolute value is 1/3, which is less than |N(beta)| = |N(theta)| = |1^2 + 1*1 - 3*1^2| = |1 + 1 - 3| = |-1| = 1. So 1/3 &lt; 1, which works. Therefore, the remainder has norm less than that of beta, so the division works.

Alternatively, if we choose m = 0 and n = 0, then q = 0. The remainder is xi - 0 = xi, whose norm is:

N(2/3 + (1/3)theta) = (2/3)^2 + (2/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 4/9 + 2/9 - 3/9 = (4 + 2 - 3)/9 = 3/9 = 1/3. Absolute value 1/3 &lt; 1. So either way, we get a remainder with smaller norm.

Therefore, these examples support the conclusion that the ring is Euclidean.

Additionally, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain was found to be 13/48 ≈ 0.27, which is less than 1, this implies that the ring is indeed norm-Euclidean.

Therefore, after this thorough check, I can conclude that \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain, we start by noting that this ring is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). The element \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\) is an algebraic integer with minimal polynomial \(x^2 - x - 3\), which confirms that \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is indeed the ring of integers.

A key property of Euclidean domains is the existence of a Euclidean function, typically the absolute value of the norm in quadratic fields. For the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), the norm of an element \(a + b\theta\) is given by \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). 

To verify the Euclidean property, we need to show that for any elements \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exist \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\). This is equivalent to showing that for any \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

By analyzing the norm function and checking the maximum value of \(N(\xi - \gamma)\) over the fundamental domain, we find that the maximum norm on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is \(\frac{13}{48}\), which is less than 1. This ensures that for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that the norm of the remainder is less than the norm of \(\beta\).

Examples and calculations confirm that the division algorithm holds, and the norm function serves as a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain. Hmm, let&#x27;s start by recalling some definitions. A Euclidean domain is an integral domain where we can perform the Euclidean algorithm, which basically means there&#x27;s a way to measure the &quot;size&quot; of elements (called a Euclidean function) such that for any two elements \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b \neq 0\)), there exist \(q\) and \(r\) where \(a = bq + r\) and either \(r = 0\) or the size of \(r\) is less than the size of \(b\).

First, let me make sure I understand the ring in question. The ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) consists of all numbers of the form \(a + b\left(\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers. Let me simplify that expression a bit. Let me denote \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\). So the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\).

I know that \(\theta\) is a root of a quadratic equation. Let me find its minimal polynomial. If \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\), then multiplying both sides by 2 gives \(2\theta = \sqrt{13} + 1\). Rearranging, \(\sqrt{13} = 2\theta - 1\). Squaring both sides, \(13 = (2\theta - 1)^2 = 4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1\). Then, moving everything to one side: \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1 - 13 = 0\), so \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta - 12 = 0\). Dividing both sides by 4: \(\theta^2 - \theta - 3 = 0\). So the minimal polynomial is \(x^2 - x - 3\). Therefore, \(\theta\) is an algebraic integer of degree 2, which means \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Wait, hold on. The ring of integers in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is typically \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{d}}{2}\right]\) when \(d \equiv 1 \mod 4\), and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]\) otherwise. Here, \(d = 13\), which is 1 mod 4, so the ring of integers should be \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). But in our case, the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\), which is the same as \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). So actually, this ring is the full ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Therefore, we are dealing with the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Now, I need to recall whether this ring is a Euclidean domain. I know that for quadratic fields, some rings of integers are Euclidean, and others are not. For example, \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) (Gaussian integers) and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]\) are Euclidean, but others like \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]\) are not even UFDs.

But since 13 is a positive square-free integer, we&#x27;re dealing with a real quadratic field. Now, the question is whether its ring of integers is Euclidean with respect to the norm. Sometimes real quadratic fields are Euclidean, sometimes not. I remember that for small discriminants, like 5, 8, 12, etc., some are Euclidean. But I need to check specifically for 13.

Wait, let me recall: The Minkowski bound for the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) can be used to check whether it is a PID. If the class number is 1, then it is a PID. Now, Euclidean domains are PIDs, but not all PIDs are Euclidean. So even if the class number is 1, it might not be Euclidean. But for some quadratic fields, it&#x27;s known whether they are Euclidean.

Looking up my memory, I think that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) has class number 1. Let me verify that. For real quadratic fields, the class number is more complicated, but I recall that 13 is a prime where the class number is 1. Wait, primes like 5, 13, 17... Hmm, I need to be careful. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\) has class number 1, but \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{10})\) does not. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall specific results. According to what I remember, the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed a PID, hence has class number 1. But is it Euclidean? Some references say that for real quadratic fields, Euclideanity is known for certain cases. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7})\), and some others are Euclidean with respect to the norm. However, for 13, I need to check.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: A real quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is norm-Euclidean if and only if \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, 73\). Wait, but I might be mixing up different sources. Let me verify.

Actually, according to some references, the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields are those with \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37,\) and \( 73\). So 13 is included here. Wait, but I need to check if this is accurate.

Alternatively, I can check specific literature. For example, in the case of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), the ring of integers is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\), which is the same as our ring. Now, according to some sources, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is norm-Euclidean. Let me recall that the norm in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is given by \(N(a + b\sqrt{d}) = a^2 - db^2\). But in our case, since the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) where \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the norm would be \(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;)\), where \(\theta&#x27;\) is the conjugate of \(\theta\). Since \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the conjugate is \(\theta&#x27; = \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}\). So expanding the norm:

\(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;) = a^2 + ab(\theta + \theta&#x27;) + b^2 \theta \theta&#x27;\).

We know from the minimal polynomial that \(\theta + \theta&#x27; = 1\) (since the coefficient of \(x\) in \(x^2 - x - 3\) is -1, so sum of roots is 1) and \(\theta \theta&#x27; = -3\) (the constant term). Therefore:

\(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab(1) + b^2(-3) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\).

So the norm here is \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). For the ring to be Euclidean, given any elements \(a\) and \(b\) in the ring (\(b \neq 0\)), there should exist \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\).

So to prove it&#x27;s Euclidean, we need to show that for any \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exists \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\).

Alternatively, this can sometimes be approached by showing that for any element \(\alpha / \beta\) in \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists an element \(\gamma\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\alpha/\beta - \gamma) &lt; 1\). This is equivalent to the ring being Euclidean, as the norm is multiplicative.

So, let me think about this. For any element \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), we need to find \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

Since \(\xi\) can be written as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\), we need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) by integers such that the norm of \((x - a) + (y - b)\theta\) is less than 1.

Let me write \(\xi = s + t\theta\), where \(s, t \in \mathbb{Q}\). Then, the norm of \(\xi - \gamma\) where \(\gamma = a + b\theta\) is:

\(N((s - a) + (t - b)\theta) = (s - a)^2 + (s - a)(t - b) - 3(t - b)^2\).

We need this to be less than 1.

To ensure this, we need to find integers \(a, b\) such that \(|s - a|\) and \(|t - b|\) are small enough such that the above expression is less than 1.

Alternatively, since \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is a lattice in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), the problem reduces to covering the plane with regions around each lattice point such that every point in the plane is within a distance less than 1 (in the norm) from some lattice point. If such a covering is possible, then the ring is Euclidean.

But visualizing this for the norm \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\) might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can use the geometry of numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I can check known results. If \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is known to be norm-Euclidean, then the answer is yes. Let me check my memory again. I recall that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed one of the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields. For example, according to the book &quot;Introductory Algebraic Number Theory&quot; by Alaca and Williams, the list of norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields includes those with discriminant 5, 8, 12, 13, 17, 21, 24, 28, 29, 33, 37, etc. So 13 is included. Therefore, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But to be thorough, let me attempt to outline why \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is Euclidean. Let&#x27;s consider the norm function \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). Suppose we have two elements \(\alpha, \beta \neq 0\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), and we want to divide \(\alpha\) by \(\beta\).

Compute \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Express \(\xi\) as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\). We need to find \(q = m + n\theta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Let \(x = m + \delta\) and \(y = n + \epsilon\), where \(m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(\delta, \epsilon \in (-1/2, 1/2]\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = (\delta + \epsilon \theta)^2 + (\delta + \epsilon \theta)(\epsilon) - 3\epsilon^2\).

Wait, maybe this approach isn&#x27;t straightforward. Let&#x27;s instead compute the norm directly:

\(N(\xi - q) = (x - m)^2 + (x - m)(y - n) - 3(y - n)^2\).

Let me set \(u = x - m\) and \(v = y - n\), so \(|u| \leq 1/2\) and \(|v| \leq 1/2\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

We need to show that this is less than 1 for some choice of \(m, n\) such that \(|u|, |v| \leq 1/2\).

Wait, but actually, \(u\) and \(v\) can be in the interval \((-1/2, 1/2]\), so we need to check the maximum possible value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) over that square.

But let me compute the maximum value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) for \(u, v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

To find the maximum, we can take partial derivatives. Let \(f(u, v) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

Compute \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = 2u + v\), and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = u - 6v\).

Setting the derivatives to zero:

1. \(2u + v = 0\)
2. \(u - 6v = 0\)

From the second equation: \(u = 6v\). Plugging into the first equation: \(2(6v) + v = 0 \implies 13v = 0 \implies v = 0\). Then \(u = 0\). So the critical point is at (0, 0), which is a minimum? Wait, check the second derivatives.

The Hessian matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; -6
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant is (2)(-6) - (1)(1) = -12 - 1 = -13 &lt; 0. So the critical point at (0,0) is a saddle point. Therefore, the maximum of \(f(u, v)\) on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) occurs on the boundary.

So let&#x27;s check the boundaries.

Case 1: \(u = 1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

Then, \(f(1/2, v) = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 + (1/2)v - 3v^2\).

This is a quadratic in v. The maximum occurs either at the vertex or endpoints.

Vertex at \(v = -b/(2a)\). Here, a = -3, b = 1/2.

So vertex at \(v = -(1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/6 = 1/12\). Within the interval [-1/2, 1/2].

Compute f(1/2, 1/12) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/12) - 3*(1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Convert to 48 denominators:

12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Compute endpoints:

At v = -1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3*(1/4) = 0 - 3/4 = -3/4.

At v = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum on this edge is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Case 2: \(u = -1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(-1/2, v) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 - (1/2)v - 3v^2.

Again, quadratic in v with a = -3, b = -1/2.

Vertex at v = -(-1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/(-6) = -1/12.

Compute f(-1/2, -1/12) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/12) - 3*(-1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Same as before, 12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

At endpoints:

v = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

v = 1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum here is 13/48.

Case 3: \(v = 1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, 1/2) = u^2 + u*(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = u^2 + u/2 - 3/4.

This is quadratic in u, opening upwards. The vertex is at u = -b/(2a) = -(1/2)/(2*1) = -1/4.

Compute f(-1/4, 1/2) = (-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

At endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = -1/4 as before.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum on this edge is -1/4, which is not higher than previous maxima.

Case 4: \(v = -1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, -1/2) = u^2 + u*(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = u^2 - u/2 - 3/4.

Quadratic in u, vertex at u = (1/2)/(2*1) = 1/4.

Compute f(1/4, -1/2) = (1/4)^2 - (1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

Endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = -3/4.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = (-1/2)^2 - (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum here is -1/4.

Case 5: Edges where u or v is fixed at 1/2 or -1/2, but we already covered all edges.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(N(\xi - q)\) over the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708, which is less than 1. Therefore, for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\). Hence, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is norm-Euclidean.

Wait, hold on. If the maximum of \(N(\xi - q)\) is 13/48 which is approximately 0.27, which is definitely less than 1. Therefore, this would imply that the norm is a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring is Euclidean.

But wait, this seems conflicting with my initial uncertainty, but according to the calculation, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain is less than 1, it is Euclidean. Therefore, the answer should be yes, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have two elements in the ring, say \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), and try to divide them. Let&#x27;s take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = 2\). Then, \(\xi = \theta / 2 = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4\). So we need to find \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Express \(\xi\) as \(0 + (1/4)\theta\). So \(x = 0\), \(y = 1/4\). We need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) with integers \(m\) and \(n\). The closest integers to \(x = 0\) is \(m = 0\), and to \(y = 1/4\) is \(n = 0\) or \(n = 1\). Let&#x27;s check both:

If \(n = 0\), then \(q = 0 + 0\theta = 0\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi\), and \(N(\xi) = (0)^2 + (0)(1/4) - 3*(1/4)^2 = -3/16\). The norm is negative, but in absolute value, 3/16, which is less than 1.

But wait, the norm can be negative here? The norm in a real quadratic field is \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\), which can indeed be negative. However, when we talk about the Euclidean function, we usually take the absolute value of the norm. So in this case, |N(\xi - q)| = 3/16 &lt; 1. So this works.

Alternatively, if we take \(n = 1\), then \(q = 0 + 1\theta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi - \theta = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4 - (1 + \sqrt{13})/2 = (-1 - \sqrt{13})/4\). Then, N(\xi - q) = [(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta] has norm:

Let me compute it:

(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta = -1/4 - (1/4)\theta. The norm is:

(-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(-1/4) - 3*(-1/4)^2 = 1/16 + 1/16 - 3/16 = (1 + 1 - 3)/16 = (-1)/16. Absolute value is 1/16, which is even smaller. So either way, the norm is less than 1. Therefore, in this case, we can write \(\theta = 2*0 + r\) where \(N(r) = 3/16 &lt; N(2) = 4\), but actually, in the division, since we are allowed to choose any q, even if the norm is negative, as long as the absolute value is less than N(b). Wait, but in the division algorithm, the remainder can have norm less than that of beta. However, in this case, the norm of beta is N(2) = 4. The remainder here has norm |N(r)| = 3/16, which is less than 4. But actually, in the standard division algorithm, we have \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\). However, in the case of negative norms, perhaps we need to take the absolute value? Wait, the norm here is actually the field norm, which can be positive or negative. But in the context of Euclidean domains, the Euclidean function is usually taken to be the absolute value of the norm.

Wait, but in the case of the Gaussian integers, the norm is always non-negative, so it&#x27;s clear. In real quadratic fields, the norm can be negative, but since we need the Euclidean function to map to non-negative integers, we take the absolute value. Therefore, the Euclidean function here is |N(a)|. Therefore, when we say \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\), it&#x27;s actually |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So even if r has a negative norm, as long as its absolute value is less than |N(b)|, it&#x27;s okay.

But in our calculation above, when we approximated \(\xi = \theta / 2\) by q = 0, we got |N(\(\xi - 0\))| = 3/16 &lt; |N(2)| = 4. Wait, but 3/16 is much less than 4. However, in the division algorithm, we need |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So in this case, 3/16 &lt; 4, so it&#x27;s fine. Therefore, the division works.

Another example: take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, dividing \(\theta\) by \(\theta\), we get \(\xi = 1\), which is already in the ring, so the remainder is 0.

Alternatively, take \(\alpha = 1 + \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi = (1 + \theta)/\theta = 1/\theta + 1\). Since \(\theta\) satisfies \(\theta^2 = \theta + 3\), so \(1/\theta = (\theta - 1)/3\). Therefore, \(\xi = (\theta - 1)/3 + 1 = (theta - 1 + 3)/3 = (theta + 2)/3. So approximate this by some q in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\). Let me compute the numerical values.

theta = (1 + sqrt(13))/2 ≈ (1 + 3.6055)/2 ≈ 4.6055/2 ≈ 2.30275.

So xi = (theta + 2)/3 ≈ (2.30275 + 2)/3 ≈ 4.30275/3 ≈ 1.43425.

So in terms of the basis {1, theta}, xi is approximately 1.43425. So express this as x + y theta, where x and y are rational numbers. Wait, but xi = (theta + 2)/3, which is (2)/3 + (1)/3 theta. So x = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 and y = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333. So we need to approximate x and y with integers m and n. The closest integers to x = 2/3 is m = 1 or 0. If we take m = 1, then n should be 0 or 1? Wait, y = 1/3. The closest integer to 1/3 is 0. So maybe take m = 1, n = 0. Then, q = 1 + 0*theta = 1. Then, the remainder is xi - q = (2/3 - 1) + (1/3 - 0) theta = (-1/3) + (1/3) theta. The norm of this is:

N(-1/3 + (1/3)theta) = (-1/3)^2 + (-1/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 1/9 - 1/9 - 3/9 = (-3)/9 = -1/3. Absolute value is 1/3, which is less than |N(beta)| = |N(theta)| = |1^2 + 1*1 - 3*1^2| = |1 + 1 - 3| = |-1| = 1. So 1/3 &lt; 1, which works. Therefore, the remainder has norm less than that of beta, so the division works.

Alternatively, if we choose m = 0 and n = 0, then q = 0. The remainder is xi - 0 = xi, whose norm is:

N(2/3 + (1/3)theta) = (2/3)^2 + (2/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 4/9 + 2/9 - 3/9 = (4 + 2 - 3)/9 = 3/9 = 1/3. Absolute value 1/3 &lt; 1. So either way, we get a remainder with smaller norm.

Therefore, these examples support the conclusion that the ring is Euclidean.

Additionally, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain was found to be 13/48 ≈ 0.27, which is less than 1, this implies that the ring is indeed norm-Euclidean.

Therefore, after this thorough check, I can conclude that \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain, we start by noting that this ring is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). The element \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\) is an algebraic integer with minimal polynomial \(x^2 - x - 3\), which confirms that \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is indeed the ring of integers.

A key property of Euclidean domains is the existence of a Euclidean function, typically the absolute value of the norm in quadratic fields. For the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), the norm of an element \(a + b\theta\) is given by \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). 

To verify the Euclidean property, we need to show that for any elements \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exist \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\). This is equivalent to showing that for any \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

By analyzing the norm function and checking the maximum value of \(N(\xi - \gamma)\) over the fundamental domain, we find that the maximum norm on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is \(\frac{13}{48}\), which is less than 1. This ensures that for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that the norm of the remainder is less than the norm of \(\beta\).

Examples and calculations confirm that the division algorithm holds, and the norm function serves as a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain. Hmm, let&#x27;s start by recalling some definitions. A Euclidean domain is an integral domain where we can perform the Euclidean algorithm, which basically means there&#x27;s a way to measure the &quot;size&quot; of elements (called a Euclidean function) such that for any two elements \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b \neq 0\)), there exist \(q\) and \(r\) where \(a = bq + r\) and either \(r = 0\) or the size of \(r\) is less than the size of \(b\).

First, let me make sure I understand the ring in question. The ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) consists of all numbers of the form \(a + b\left(\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers. Let me simplify that expression a bit. Let me denote \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\). So the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\).

I know that \(\theta\) is a root of a quadratic equation. Let me find its minimal polynomial. If \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\), then multiplying both sides by 2 gives \(2\theta = \sqrt{13} + 1\). Rearranging, \(\sqrt{13} = 2\theta - 1\). Squaring both sides, \(13 = (2\theta - 1)^2 = 4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1\). Then, moving everything to one side: \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1 - 13 = 0\), so \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta - 12 = 0\). Dividing both sides by 4: \(\theta^2 - \theta - 3 = 0\). So the minimal polynomial is \(x^2 - x - 3\). Therefore, \(\theta\) is an algebraic integer of degree 2, which means \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Wait, hold on. The ring of integers in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is typically \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{d}}{2}\right]\) when \(d \equiv 1 \mod 4\), and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]\) otherwise. Here, \(d = 13\), which is 1 mod 4, so the ring of integers should be \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). But in our case, the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\), which is the same as \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). So actually, this ring is the full ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Therefore, we are dealing with the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Now, I need to recall whether this ring is a Euclidean domain. I know that for quadratic fields, some rings of integers are Euclidean, and others are not. For example, \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) (Gaussian integers) and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]\) are Euclidean, but others like \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]\) are not even UFDs.

But since 13 is a positive square-free integer, we&#x27;re dealing with a real quadratic field. Now, the question is whether its ring of integers is Euclidean with respect to the norm. Sometimes real quadratic fields are Euclidean, sometimes not. I remember that for small discriminants, like 5, 8, 12, etc., some are Euclidean. But I need to check specifically for 13.

Wait, let me recall: The Minkowski bound for the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) can be used to check whether it is a PID. If the class number is 1, then it is a PID. Now, Euclidean domains are PIDs, but not all PIDs are Euclidean. So even if the class number is 1, it might not be Euclidean. But for some quadratic fields, it&#x27;s known whether they are Euclidean.

Looking up my memory, I think that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) has class number 1. Let me verify that. For real quadratic fields, the class number is more complicated, but I recall that 13 is a prime where the class number is 1. Wait, primes like 5, 13, 17... Hmm, I need to be careful. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\) has class number 1, but \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{10})\) does not. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall specific results. According to what I remember, the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed a PID, hence has class number 1. But is it Euclidean? Some references say that for real quadratic fields, Euclideanity is known for certain cases. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7})\), and some others are Euclidean with respect to the norm. However, for 13, I need to check.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: A real quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is norm-Euclidean if and only if \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, 73\). Wait, but I might be mixing up different sources. Let me verify.

Actually, according to some references, the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields are those with \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37,\) and \( 73\). So 13 is included here. Wait, but I need to check if this is accurate.

Alternatively, I can check specific literature. For example, in the case of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), the ring of integers is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\), which is the same as our ring. Now, according to some sources, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is norm-Euclidean. Let me recall that the norm in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is given by \(N(a + b\sqrt{d}) = a^2 - db^2\). But in our case, since the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) where \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the norm would be \(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;)\), where \(\theta&#x27;\) is the conjugate of \(\theta\). Since \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the conjugate is \(\theta&#x27; = \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}\). So expanding the norm:

\(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;) = a^2 + ab(\theta + \theta&#x27;) + b^2 \theta \theta&#x27;\).

We know from the minimal polynomial that \(\theta + \theta&#x27; = 1\) (since the coefficient of \(x\) in \(x^2 - x - 3\) is -1, so sum of roots is 1) and \(\theta \theta&#x27; = -3\) (the constant term). Therefore:

\(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab(1) + b^2(-3) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\).

So the norm here is \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). For the ring to be Euclidean, given any elements \(a\) and \(b\) in the ring (\(b \neq 0\)), there should exist \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\).

So to prove it&#x27;s Euclidean, we need to show that for any \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exists \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\).

Alternatively, this can sometimes be approached by showing that for any element \(\alpha / \beta\) in \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists an element \(\gamma\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\alpha/\beta - \gamma) &lt; 1\). This is equivalent to the ring being Euclidean, as the norm is multiplicative.

So, let me think about this. For any element \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), we need to find \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

Since \(\xi\) can be written as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\), we need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) by integers such that the norm of \((x - a) + (y - b)\theta\) is less than 1.

Let me write \(\xi = s + t\theta\), where \(s, t \in \mathbb{Q}\). Then, the norm of \(\xi - \gamma\) where \(\gamma = a + b\theta\) is:

\(N((s - a) + (t - b)\theta) = (s - a)^2 + (s - a)(t - b) - 3(t - b)^2\).

We need this to be less than 1.

To ensure this, we need to find integers \(a, b\) such that \(|s - a|\) and \(|t - b|\) are small enough such that the above expression is less than 1.

Alternatively, since \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is a lattice in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), the problem reduces to covering the plane with regions around each lattice point such that every point in the plane is within a distance less than 1 (in the norm) from some lattice point. If such a covering is possible, then the ring is Euclidean.

But visualizing this for the norm \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\) might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can use the geometry of numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I can check known results. If \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is known to be norm-Euclidean, then the answer is yes. Let me check my memory again. I recall that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed one of the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields. For example, according to the book &quot;Introductory Algebraic Number Theory&quot; by Alaca and Williams, the list of norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields includes those with discriminant 5, 8, 12, 13, 17, 21, 24, 28, 29, 33, 37, etc. So 13 is included. Therefore, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But to be thorough, let me attempt to outline why \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is Euclidean. Let&#x27;s consider the norm function \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). Suppose we have two elements \(\alpha, \beta \neq 0\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), and we want to divide \(\alpha\) by \(\beta\).

Compute \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Express \(\xi\) as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\). We need to find \(q = m + n\theta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Let \(x = m + \delta\) and \(y = n + \epsilon\), where \(m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(\delta, \epsilon \in (-1/2, 1/2]\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = (\delta + \epsilon \theta)^2 + (\delta + \epsilon \theta)(\epsilon) - 3\epsilon^2\).

Wait, maybe this approach isn&#x27;t straightforward. Let&#x27;s instead compute the norm directly:

\(N(\xi - q) = (x - m)^2 + (x - m)(y - n) - 3(y - n)^2\).

Let me set \(u = x - m\) and \(v = y - n\), so \(|u| \leq 1/2\) and \(|v| \leq 1/2\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

We need to show that this is less than 1 for some choice of \(m, n\) such that \(|u|, |v| \leq 1/2\).

Wait, but actually, \(u\) and \(v\) can be in the interval \((-1/2, 1/2]\), so we need to check the maximum possible value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) over that square.

But let me compute the maximum value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) for \(u, v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

To find the maximum, we can take partial derivatives. Let \(f(u, v) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

Compute \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = 2u + v\), and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = u - 6v\).

Setting the derivatives to zero:

1. \(2u + v = 0\)
2. \(u - 6v = 0\)

From the second equation: \(u = 6v\). Plugging into the first equation: \(2(6v) + v = 0 \implies 13v = 0 \implies v = 0\). Then \(u = 0\). So the critical point is at (0, 0), which is a minimum? Wait, check the second derivatives.

The Hessian matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; -6
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant is (2)(-6) - (1)(1) = -12 - 1 = -13 &lt; 0. So the critical point at (0,0) is a saddle point. Therefore, the maximum of \(f(u, v)\) on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) occurs on the boundary.

So let&#x27;s check the boundaries.

Case 1: \(u = 1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

Then, \(f(1/2, v) = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 + (1/2)v - 3v^2\).

This is a quadratic in v. The maximum occurs either at the vertex or endpoints.

Vertex at \(v = -b/(2a)\). Here, a = -3, b = 1/2.

So vertex at \(v = -(1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/6 = 1/12\). Within the interval [-1/2, 1/2].

Compute f(1/2, 1/12) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/12) - 3*(1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Convert to 48 denominators:

12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Compute endpoints:

At v = -1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3*(1/4) = 0 - 3/4 = -3/4.

At v = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum on this edge is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Case 2: \(u = -1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(-1/2, v) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 - (1/2)v - 3v^2.

Again, quadratic in v with a = -3, b = -1/2.

Vertex at v = -(-1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/(-6) = -1/12.

Compute f(-1/2, -1/12) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/12) - 3*(-1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Same as before, 12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

At endpoints:

v = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

v = 1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum here is 13/48.

Case 3: \(v = 1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, 1/2) = u^2 + u*(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = u^2 + u/2 - 3/4.

This is quadratic in u, opening upwards. The vertex is at u = -b/(2a) = -(1/2)/(2*1) = -1/4.

Compute f(-1/4, 1/2) = (-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

At endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = -1/4 as before.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum on this edge is -1/4, which is not higher than previous maxima.

Case 4: \(v = -1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, -1/2) = u^2 + u*(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = u^2 - u/2 - 3/4.

Quadratic in u, vertex at u = (1/2)/(2*1) = 1/4.

Compute f(1/4, -1/2) = (1/4)^2 - (1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

Endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = -3/4.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = (-1/2)^2 - (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum here is -1/4.

Case 5: Edges where u or v is fixed at 1/2 or -1/2, but we already covered all edges.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(N(\xi - q)\) over the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708, which is less than 1. Therefore, for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\). Hence, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is norm-Euclidean.

Wait, hold on. If the maximum of \(N(\xi - q)\) is 13/48 which is approximately 0.27, which is definitely less than 1. Therefore, this would imply that the norm is a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring is Euclidean.

But wait, this seems conflicting with my initial uncertainty, but according to the calculation, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain is less than 1, it is Euclidean. Therefore, the answer should be yes, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have two elements in the ring, say \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), and try to divide them. Let&#x27;s take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = 2\). Then, \(\xi = \theta / 2 = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4\). So we need to find \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Express \(\xi\) as \(0 + (1/4)\theta\). So \(x = 0\), \(y = 1/4\). We need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) with integers \(m\) and \(n\). The closest integers to \(x = 0\) is \(m = 0\), and to \(y = 1/4\) is \(n = 0\) or \(n = 1\). Let&#x27;s check both:

If \(n = 0\), then \(q = 0 + 0\theta = 0\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi\), and \(N(\xi) = (0)^2 + (0)(1/4) - 3*(1/4)^2 = -3/16\). The norm is negative, but in absolute value, 3/16, which is less than 1.

But wait, the norm can be negative here? The norm in a real quadratic field is \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\), which can indeed be negative. However, when we talk about the Euclidean function, we usually take the absolute value of the norm. So in this case, |N(\xi - q)| = 3/16 &lt; 1. So this works.

Alternatively, if we take \(n = 1\), then \(q = 0 + 1\theta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi - \theta = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4 - (1 + \sqrt{13})/2 = (-1 - \sqrt{13})/4\). Then, N(\xi - q) = [(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta] has norm:

Let me compute it:

(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta = -1/4 - (1/4)\theta. The norm is:

(-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(-1/4) - 3*(-1/4)^2 = 1/16 + 1/16 - 3/16 = (1 + 1 - 3)/16 = (-1)/16. Absolute value is 1/16, which is even smaller. So either way, the norm is less than 1. Therefore, in this case, we can write \(\theta = 2*0 + r\) where \(N(r) = 3/16 &lt; N(2) = 4\), but actually, in the division, since we are allowed to choose any q, even if the norm is negative, as long as the absolute value is less than N(b). Wait, but in the division algorithm, the remainder can have norm less than that of beta. However, in this case, the norm of beta is N(2) = 4. The remainder here has norm |N(r)| = 3/16, which is less than 4. But actually, in the standard division algorithm, we have \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\). However, in the case of negative norms, perhaps we need to take the absolute value? Wait, the norm here is actually the field norm, which can be positive or negative. But in the context of Euclidean domains, the Euclidean function is usually taken to be the absolute value of the norm.

Wait, but in the case of the Gaussian integers, the norm is always non-negative, so it&#x27;s clear. In real quadratic fields, the norm can be negative, but since we need the Euclidean function to map to non-negative integers, we take the absolute value. Therefore, the Euclidean function here is |N(a)|. Therefore, when we say \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\), it&#x27;s actually |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So even if r has a negative norm, as long as its absolute value is less than |N(b)|, it&#x27;s okay.

But in our calculation above, when we approximated \(\xi = \theta / 2\) by q = 0, we got |N(\(\xi - 0\))| = 3/16 &lt; |N(2)| = 4. Wait, but 3/16 is much less than 4. However, in the division algorithm, we need |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So in this case, 3/16 &lt; 4, so it&#x27;s fine. Therefore, the division works.

Another example: take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, dividing \(\theta\) by \(\theta\), we get \(\xi = 1\), which is already in the ring, so the remainder is 0.

Alternatively, take \(\alpha = 1 + \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi = (1 + \theta)/\theta = 1/\theta + 1\). Since \(\theta\) satisfies \(\theta^2 = \theta + 3\), so \(1/\theta = (\theta - 1)/3\). Therefore, \(\xi = (\theta - 1)/3 + 1 = (theta - 1 + 3)/3 = (theta + 2)/3. So approximate this by some q in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\). Let me compute the numerical values.

theta = (1 + sqrt(13))/2 ≈ (1 + 3.6055)/2 ≈ 4.6055/2 ≈ 2.30275.

So xi = (theta + 2)/3 ≈ (2.30275 + 2)/3 ≈ 4.30275/3 ≈ 1.43425.

So in terms of the basis {1, theta}, xi is approximately 1.43425. So express this as x + y theta, where x and y are rational numbers. Wait, but xi = (theta + 2)/3, which is (2)/3 + (1)/3 theta. So x = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 and y = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333. So we need to approximate x and y with integers m and n. The closest integers to x = 2/3 is m = 1 or 0. If we take m = 1, then n should be 0 or 1? Wait, y = 1/3. The closest integer to 1/3 is 0. So maybe take m = 1, n = 0. Then, q = 1 + 0*theta = 1. Then, the remainder is xi - q = (2/3 - 1) + (1/3 - 0) theta = (-1/3) + (1/3) theta. The norm of this is:

N(-1/3 + (1/3)theta) = (-1/3)^2 + (-1/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 1/9 - 1/9 - 3/9 = (-3)/9 = -1/3. Absolute value is 1/3, which is less than |N(beta)| = |N(theta)| = |1^2 + 1*1 - 3*1^2| = |1 + 1 - 3| = |-1| = 1. So 1/3 &lt; 1, which works. Therefore, the remainder has norm less than that of beta, so the division works.

Alternatively, if we choose m = 0 and n = 0, then q = 0. The remainder is xi - 0 = xi, whose norm is:

N(2/3 + (1/3)theta) = (2/3)^2 + (2/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 4/9 + 2/9 - 3/9 = (4 + 2 - 3)/9 = 3/9 = 1/3. Absolute value 1/3 &lt; 1. So either way, we get a remainder with smaller norm.

Therefore, these examples support the conclusion that the ring is Euclidean.

Additionally, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain was found to be 13/48 ≈ 0.27, which is less than 1, this implies that the ring is indeed norm-Euclidean.

Therefore, after this thorough check, I can conclude that \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain, we start by noting that this ring is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). The element \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\) is an algebraic integer with minimal polynomial \(x^2 - x - 3\), which confirms that \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is indeed the ring of integers.

A key property of Euclidean domains is the existence of a Euclidean function, typically the absolute value of the norm in quadratic fields. For the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), the norm of an element \(a + b\theta\) is given by \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). 

To verify the Euclidean property, we need to show that for any elements \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exist \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\). This is equivalent to showing that for any \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

By analyzing the norm function and checking the maximum value of \(N(\xi - \gamma)\) over the fundamental domain, we find that the maximum norm on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is \(\frac{13}{48}\), which is less than 1. This ensures that for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that the norm of the remainder is less than the norm of \(\beta\).

Examples and calculations confirm that the division algorithm holds, and the norm function serves as a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain. Hmm, let&#x27;s start by recalling some definitions. A Euclidean domain is an integral domain where we can perform the Euclidean algorithm, which basically means there&#x27;s a way to measure the &quot;size&quot; of elements (called a Euclidean function) such that for any two elements \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b \neq 0\)), there exist \(q\) and \(r\) where \(a = bq + r\) and either \(r = 0\) or the size of \(r\) is less than the size of \(b\).

First, let me make sure I understand the ring in question. The ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) consists of all numbers of the form \(a + b\left(\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers. Let me simplify that expression a bit. Let me denote \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\). So the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\).

I know that \(\theta\) is a root of a quadratic equation. Let me find its minimal polynomial. If \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\), then multiplying both sides by 2 gives \(2\theta = \sqrt{13} + 1\). Rearranging, \(\sqrt{13} = 2\theta - 1\). Squaring both sides, \(13 = (2\theta - 1)^2 = 4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1\). Then, moving everything to one side: \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1 - 13 = 0\), so \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta - 12 = 0\). Dividing both sides by 4: \(\theta^2 - \theta - 3 = 0\). So the minimal polynomial is \(x^2 - x - 3\). Therefore, \(\theta\) is an algebraic integer of degree 2, which means \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Wait, hold on. The ring of integers in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is typically \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{d}}{2}\right]\) when \(d \equiv 1 \mod 4\), and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]\) otherwise. Here, \(d = 13\), which is 1 mod 4, so the ring of integers should be \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). But in our case, the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\), which is the same as \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). So actually, this ring is the full ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Therefore, we are dealing with the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Now, I need to recall whether this ring is a Euclidean domain. I know that for quadratic fields, some rings of integers are Euclidean, and others are not. For example, \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) (Gaussian integers) and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]\) are Euclidean, but others like \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]\) are not even UFDs.

But since 13 is a positive square-free integer, we&#x27;re dealing with a real quadratic field. Now, the question is whether its ring of integers is Euclidean with respect to the norm. Sometimes real quadratic fields are Euclidean, sometimes not. I remember that for small discriminants, like 5, 8, 12, etc., some are Euclidean. But I need to check specifically for 13.

Wait, let me recall: The Minkowski bound for the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) can be used to check whether it is a PID. If the class number is 1, then it is a PID. Now, Euclidean domains are PIDs, but not all PIDs are Euclidean. So even if the class number is 1, it might not be Euclidean. But for some quadratic fields, it&#x27;s known whether they are Euclidean.

Looking up my memory, I think that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) has class number 1. Let me verify that. For real quadratic fields, the class number is more complicated, but I recall that 13 is a prime where the class number is 1. Wait, primes like 5, 13, 17... Hmm, I need to be careful. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\) has class number 1, but \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{10})\) does not. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall specific results. According to what I remember, the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed a PID, hence has class number 1. But is it Euclidean? Some references say that for real quadratic fields, Euclideanity is known for certain cases. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7})\), and some others are Euclidean with respect to the norm. However, for 13, I need to check.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: A real quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is norm-Euclidean if and only if \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, 73\). Wait, but I might be mixing up different sources. Let me verify.

Actually, according to some references, the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields are those with \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37,\) and \( 73\). So 13 is included here. Wait, but I need to check if this is accurate.

Alternatively, I can check specific literature. For example, in the case of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), the ring of integers is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\), which is the same as our ring. Now, according to some sources, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is norm-Euclidean. Let me recall that the norm in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is given by \(N(a + b\sqrt{d}) = a^2 - db^2\). But in our case, since the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) where \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the norm would be \(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;)\), where \(\theta&#x27;\) is the conjugate of \(\theta\). Since \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the conjugate is \(\theta&#x27; = \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}\). So expanding the norm:

\(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;) = a^2 + ab(\theta + \theta&#x27;) + b^2 \theta \theta&#x27;\).

We know from the minimal polynomial that \(\theta + \theta&#x27; = 1\) (since the coefficient of \(x\) in \(x^2 - x - 3\) is -1, so sum of roots is 1) and \(\theta \theta&#x27; = -3\) (the constant term). Therefore:

\(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab(1) + b^2(-3) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\).

So the norm here is \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). For the ring to be Euclidean, given any elements \(a\) and \(b\) in the ring (\(b \neq 0\)), there should exist \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\).

So to prove it&#x27;s Euclidean, we need to show that for any \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exists \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\).

Alternatively, this can sometimes be approached by showing that for any element \(\alpha / \beta\) in \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists an element \(\gamma\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\alpha/\beta - \gamma) &lt; 1\). This is equivalent to the ring being Euclidean, as the norm is multiplicative.

So, let me think about this. For any element \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), we need to find \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

Since \(\xi\) can be written as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\), we need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) by integers such that the norm of \((x - a) + (y - b)\theta\) is less than 1.

Let me write \(\xi = s + t\theta\), where \(s, t \in \mathbb{Q}\). Then, the norm of \(\xi - \gamma\) where \(\gamma = a + b\theta\) is:

\(N((s - a) + (t - b)\theta) = (s - a)^2 + (s - a)(t - b) - 3(t - b)^2\).

We need this to be less than 1.

To ensure this, we need to find integers \(a, b\) such that \(|s - a|\) and \(|t - b|\) are small enough such that the above expression is less than 1.

Alternatively, since \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is a lattice in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), the problem reduces to covering the plane with regions around each lattice point such that every point in the plane is within a distance less than 1 (in the norm) from some lattice point. If such a covering is possible, then the ring is Euclidean.

But visualizing this for the norm \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\) might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can use the geometry of numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I can check known results. If \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is known to be norm-Euclidean, then the answer is yes. Let me check my memory again. I recall that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed one of the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields. For example, according to the book &quot;Introductory Algebraic Number Theory&quot; by Alaca and Williams, the list of norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields includes those with discriminant 5, 8, 12, 13, 17, 21, 24, 28, 29, 33, 37, etc. So 13 is included. Therefore, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But to be thorough, let me attempt to outline why \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is Euclidean. Let&#x27;s consider the norm function \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). Suppose we have two elements \(\alpha, \beta \neq 0\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), and we want to divide \(\alpha\) by \(\beta\).

Compute \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Express \(\xi\) as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\). We need to find \(q = m + n\theta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Let \(x = m + \delta\) and \(y = n + \epsilon\), where \(m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(\delta, \epsilon \in (-1/2, 1/2]\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = (\delta + \epsilon \theta)^2 + (\delta + \epsilon \theta)(\epsilon) - 3\epsilon^2\).

Wait, maybe this approach isn&#x27;t straightforward. Let&#x27;s instead compute the norm directly:

\(N(\xi - q) = (x - m)^2 + (x - m)(y - n) - 3(y - n)^2\).

Let me set \(u = x - m\) and \(v = y - n\), so \(|u| \leq 1/2\) and \(|v| \leq 1/2\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

We need to show that this is less than 1 for some choice of \(m, n\) such that \(|u|, |v| \leq 1/2\).

Wait, but actually, \(u\) and \(v\) can be in the interval \((-1/2, 1/2]\), so we need to check the maximum possible value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) over that square.

But let me compute the maximum value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) for \(u, v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

To find the maximum, we can take partial derivatives. Let \(f(u, v) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

Compute \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = 2u + v\), and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = u - 6v\).

Setting the derivatives to zero:

1. \(2u + v = 0\)
2. \(u - 6v = 0\)

From the second equation: \(u = 6v\). Plugging into the first equation: \(2(6v) + v = 0 \implies 13v = 0 \implies v = 0\). Then \(u = 0\). So the critical point is at (0, 0), which is a minimum? Wait, check the second derivatives.

The Hessian matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; -6
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant is (2)(-6) - (1)(1) = -12 - 1 = -13 &lt; 0. So the critical point at (0,0) is a saddle point. Therefore, the maximum of \(f(u, v)\) on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) occurs on the boundary.

So let&#x27;s check the boundaries.

Case 1: \(u = 1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

Then, \(f(1/2, v) = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 + (1/2)v - 3v^2\).

This is a quadratic in v. The maximum occurs either at the vertex or endpoints.

Vertex at \(v = -b/(2a)\). Here, a = -3, b = 1/2.

So vertex at \(v = -(1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/6 = 1/12\). Within the interval [-1/2, 1/2].

Compute f(1/2, 1/12) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/12) - 3*(1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Convert to 48 denominators:

12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Compute endpoints:

At v = -1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3*(1/4) = 0 - 3/4 = -3/4.

At v = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum on this edge is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Case 2: \(u = -1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(-1/2, v) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 - (1/2)v - 3v^2.

Again, quadratic in v with a = -3, b = -1/2.

Vertex at v = -(-1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/(-6) = -1/12.

Compute f(-1/2, -1/12) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/12) - 3*(-1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Same as before, 12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

At endpoints:

v = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

v = 1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum here is 13/48.

Case 3: \(v = 1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, 1/2) = u^2 + u*(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = u^2 + u/2 - 3/4.

This is quadratic in u, opening upwards. The vertex is at u = -b/(2a) = -(1/2)/(2*1) = -1/4.

Compute f(-1/4, 1/2) = (-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

At endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = -1/4 as before.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum on this edge is -1/4, which is not higher than previous maxima.

Case 4: \(v = -1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, -1/2) = u^2 + u*(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = u^2 - u/2 - 3/4.

Quadratic in u, vertex at u = (1/2)/(2*1) = 1/4.

Compute f(1/4, -1/2) = (1/4)^2 - (1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

Endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = -3/4.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = (-1/2)^2 - (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum here is -1/4.

Case 5: Edges where u or v is fixed at 1/2 or -1/2, but we already covered all edges.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(N(\xi - q)\) over the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708, which is less than 1. Therefore, for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\). Hence, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is norm-Euclidean.

Wait, hold on. If the maximum of \(N(\xi - q)\) is 13/48 which is approximately 0.27, which is definitely less than 1. Therefore, this would imply that the norm is a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring is Euclidean.

But wait, this seems conflicting with my initial uncertainty, but according to the calculation, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain is less than 1, it is Euclidean. Therefore, the answer should be yes, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have two elements in the ring, say \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), and try to divide them. Let&#x27;s take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = 2\). Then, \(\xi = \theta / 2 = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4\). So we need to find \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Express \(\xi\) as \(0 + (1/4)\theta\). So \(x = 0\), \(y = 1/4\). We need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) with integers \(m\) and \(n\). The closest integers to \(x = 0\) is \(m = 0\), and to \(y = 1/4\) is \(n = 0\) or \(n = 1\). Let&#x27;s check both:

If \(n = 0\), then \(q = 0 + 0\theta = 0\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi\), and \(N(\xi) = (0)^2 + (0)(1/4) - 3*(1/4)^2 = -3/16\). The norm is negative, but in absolute value, 3/16, which is less than 1.

But wait, the norm can be negative here? The norm in a real quadratic field is \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\), which can indeed be negative. However, when we talk about the Euclidean function, we usually take the absolute value of the norm. So in this case, |N(\xi - q)| = 3/16 &lt; 1. So this works.

Alternatively, if we take \(n = 1\), then \(q = 0 + 1\theta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi - \theta = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4 - (1 + \sqrt{13})/2 = (-1 - \sqrt{13})/4\). Then, N(\xi - q) = [(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta] has norm:

Let me compute it:

(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta = -1/4 - (1/4)\theta. The norm is:

(-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(-1/4) - 3*(-1/4)^2 = 1/16 + 1/16 - 3/16 = (1 + 1 - 3)/16 = (-1)/16. Absolute value is 1/16, which is even smaller. So either way, the norm is less than 1. Therefore, in this case, we can write \(\theta = 2*0 + r\) where \(N(r) = 3/16 &lt; N(2) = 4\), but actually, in the division, since we are allowed to choose any q, even if the norm is negative, as long as the absolute value is less than N(b). Wait, but in the division algorithm, the remainder can have norm less than that of beta. However, in this case, the norm of beta is N(2) = 4. The remainder here has norm |N(r)| = 3/16, which is less than 4. But actually, in the standard division algorithm, we have \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\). However, in the case of negative norms, perhaps we need to take the absolute value? Wait, the norm here is actually the field norm, which can be positive or negative. But in the context of Euclidean domains, the Euclidean function is usually taken to be the absolute value of the norm.

Wait, but in the case of the Gaussian integers, the norm is always non-negative, so it&#x27;s clear. In real quadratic fields, the norm can be negative, but since we need the Euclidean function to map to non-negative integers, we take the absolute value. Therefore, the Euclidean function here is |N(a)|. Therefore, when we say \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\), it&#x27;s actually |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So even if r has a negative norm, as long as its absolute value is less than |N(b)|, it&#x27;s okay.

But in our calculation above, when we approximated \(\xi = \theta / 2\) by q = 0, we got |N(\(\xi - 0\))| = 3/16 &lt; |N(2)| = 4. Wait, but 3/16 is much less than 4. However, in the division algorithm, we need |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So in this case, 3/16 &lt; 4, so it&#x27;s fine. Therefore, the division works.

Another example: take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, dividing \(\theta\) by \(\theta\), we get \(\xi = 1\), which is already in the ring, so the remainder is 0.

Alternatively, take \(\alpha = 1 + \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi = (1 + \theta)/\theta = 1/\theta + 1\). Since \(\theta\) satisfies \(\theta^2 = \theta + 3\), so \(1/\theta = (\theta - 1)/3\). Therefore, \(\xi = (\theta - 1)/3 + 1 = (theta - 1 + 3)/3 = (theta + 2)/3. So approximate this by some q in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\). Let me compute the numerical values.

theta = (1 + sqrt(13))/2 ≈ (1 + 3.6055)/2 ≈ 4.6055/2 ≈ 2.30275.

So xi = (theta + 2)/3 ≈ (2.30275 + 2)/3 ≈ 4.30275/3 ≈ 1.43425.

So in terms of the basis {1, theta}, xi is approximately 1.43425. So express this as x + y theta, where x and y are rational numbers. Wait, but xi = (theta + 2)/3, which is (2)/3 + (1)/3 theta. So x = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 and y = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333. So we need to approximate x and y with integers m and n. The closest integers to x = 2/3 is m = 1 or 0. If we take m = 1, then n should be 0 or 1? Wait, y = 1/3. The closest integer to 1/3 is 0. So maybe take m = 1, n = 0. Then, q = 1 + 0*theta = 1. Then, the remainder is xi - q = (2/3 - 1) + (1/3 - 0) theta = (-1/3) + (1/3) theta. The norm of this is:

N(-1/3 + (1/3)theta) = (-1/3)^2 + (-1/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 1/9 - 1/9 - 3/9 = (-3)/9 = -1/3. Absolute value is 1/3, which is less than |N(beta)| = |N(theta)| = |1^2 + 1*1 - 3*1^2| = |1 + 1 - 3| = |-1| = 1. So 1/3 &lt; 1, which works. Therefore, the remainder has norm less than that of beta, so the division works.

Alternatively, if we choose m = 0 and n = 0, then q = 0. The remainder is xi - 0 = xi, whose norm is:

N(2/3 + (1/3)theta) = (2/3)^2 + (2/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 4/9 + 2/9 - 3/9 = (4 + 2 - 3)/9 = 3/9 = 1/3. Absolute value 1/3 &lt; 1. So either way, we get a remainder with smaller norm.

Therefore, these examples support the conclusion that the ring is Euclidean.

Additionally, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain was found to be 13/48 ≈ 0.27, which is less than 1, this implies that the ring is indeed norm-Euclidean.

Therefore, after this thorough check, I can conclude that \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain, we start by noting that this ring is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). The element \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\) is an algebraic integer with minimal polynomial \(x^2 - x - 3\), which confirms that \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is indeed the ring of integers.

A key property of Euclidean domains is the existence of a Euclidean function, typically the absolute value of the norm in quadratic fields. For the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), the norm of an element \(a + b\theta\) is given by \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). 

To verify the Euclidean property, we need to show that for any elements \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exist \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\). This is equivalent to showing that for any \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

By analyzing the norm function and checking the maximum value of \(N(\xi - \gamma)\) over the fundamental domain, we find that the maximum norm on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is \(\frac{13}{48}\), which is less than 1. This ensures that for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that the norm of the remainder is less than the norm of \(\beta\).

Examples and calculations confirm that the division algorithm holds, and the norm function serves as a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain. Hmm, let&#x27;s start by recalling some definitions. A Euclidean domain is an integral domain where we can perform the Euclidean algorithm, which basically means there&#x27;s a way to measure the &quot;size&quot; of elements (called a Euclidean function) such that for any two elements \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b \neq 0\)), there exist \(q\) and \(r\) where \(a = bq + r\) and either \(r = 0\) or the size of \(r\) is less than the size of \(b\).

First, let me make sure I understand the ring in question. The ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) consists of all numbers of the form \(a + b\left(\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers. Let me simplify that expression a bit. Let me denote \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\). So the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\).

I know that \(\theta\) is a root of a quadratic equation. Let me find its minimal polynomial. If \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\), then multiplying both sides by 2 gives \(2\theta = \sqrt{13} + 1\). Rearranging, \(\sqrt{13} = 2\theta - 1\). Squaring both sides, \(13 = (2\theta - 1)^2 = 4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1\). Then, moving everything to one side: \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1 - 13 = 0\), so \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta - 12 = 0\). Dividing both sides by 4: \(\theta^2 - \theta - 3 = 0\). So the minimal polynomial is \(x^2 - x - 3\). Therefore, \(\theta\) is an algebraic integer of degree 2, which means \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Wait, hold on. The ring of integers in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is typically \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{d}}{2}\right]\) when \(d \equiv 1 \mod 4\), and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]\) otherwise. Here, \(d = 13\), which is 1 mod 4, so the ring of integers should be \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). But in our case, the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\), which is the same as \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). So actually, this ring is the full ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Therefore, we are dealing with the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Now, I need to recall whether this ring is a Euclidean domain. I know that for quadratic fields, some rings of integers are Euclidean, and others are not. For example, \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) (Gaussian integers) and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]\) are Euclidean, but others like \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]\) are not even UFDs.

But since 13 is a positive square-free integer, we&#x27;re dealing with a real quadratic field. Now, the question is whether its ring of integers is Euclidean with respect to the norm. Sometimes real quadratic fields are Euclidean, sometimes not. I remember that for small discriminants, like 5, 8, 12, etc., some are Euclidean. But I need to check specifically for 13.

Wait, let me recall: The Minkowski bound for the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) can be used to check whether it is a PID. If the class number is 1, then it is a PID. Now, Euclidean domains are PIDs, but not all PIDs are Euclidean. So even if the class number is 1, it might not be Euclidean. But for some quadratic fields, it&#x27;s known whether they are Euclidean.

Looking up my memory, I think that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) has class number 1. Let me verify that. For real quadratic fields, the class number is more complicated, but I recall that 13 is a prime where the class number is 1. Wait, primes like 5, 13, 17... Hmm, I need to be careful. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\) has class number 1, but \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{10})\) does not. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall specific results. According to what I remember, the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed a PID, hence has class number 1. But is it Euclidean? Some references say that for real quadratic fields, Euclideanity is known for certain cases. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7})\), and some others are Euclidean with respect to the norm. However, for 13, I need to check.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: A real quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is norm-Euclidean if and only if \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, 73\). Wait, but I might be mixing up different sources. Let me verify.

Actually, according to some references, the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields are those with \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37,\) and \( 73\). So 13 is included here. Wait, but I need to check if this is accurate.

Alternatively, I can check specific literature. For example, in the case of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), the ring of integers is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\), which is the same as our ring. Now, according to some sources, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is norm-Euclidean. Let me recall that the norm in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is given by \(N(a + b\sqrt{d}) = a^2 - db^2\). But in our case, since the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) where \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the norm would be \(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;)\), where \(\theta&#x27;\) is the conjugate of \(\theta\). Since \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the conjugate is \(\theta&#x27; = \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}\). So expanding the norm:

\(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;) = a^2 + ab(\theta + \theta&#x27;) + b^2 \theta \theta&#x27;\).

We know from the minimal polynomial that \(\theta + \theta&#x27; = 1\) (since the coefficient of \(x\) in \(x^2 - x - 3\) is -1, so sum of roots is 1) and \(\theta \theta&#x27; = -3\) (the constant term). Therefore:

\(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab(1) + b^2(-3) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\).

So the norm here is \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). For the ring to be Euclidean, given any elements \(a\) and \(b\) in the ring (\(b \neq 0\)), there should exist \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\).

So to prove it&#x27;s Euclidean, we need to show that for any \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exists \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\).

Alternatively, this can sometimes be approached by showing that for any element \(\alpha / \beta\) in \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists an element \(\gamma\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\alpha/\beta - \gamma) &lt; 1\). This is equivalent to the ring being Euclidean, as the norm is multiplicative.

So, let me think about this. For any element \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), we need to find \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

Since \(\xi\) can be written as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\), we need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) by integers such that the norm of \((x - a) + (y - b)\theta\) is less than 1.

Let me write \(\xi = s + t\theta\), where \(s, t \in \mathbb{Q}\). Then, the norm of \(\xi - \gamma\) where \(\gamma = a + b\theta\) is:

\(N((s - a) + (t - b)\theta) = (s - a)^2 + (s - a)(t - b) - 3(t - b)^2\).

We need this to be less than 1.

To ensure this, we need to find integers \(a, b\) such that \(|s - a|\) and \(|t - b|\) are small enough such that the above expression is less than 1.

Alternatively, since \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is a lattice in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), the problem reduces to covering the plane with regions around each lattice point such that every point in the plane is within a distance less than 1 (in the norm) from some lattice point. If such a covering is possible, then the ring is Euclidean.

But visualizing this for the norm \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\) might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can use the geometry of numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I can check known results. If \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is known to be norm-Euclidean, then the answer is yes. Let me check my memory again. I recall that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed one of the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields. For example, according to the book &quot;Introductory Algebraic Number Theory&quot; by Alaca and Williams, the list of norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields includes those with discriminant 5, 8, 12, 13, 17, 21, 24, 28, 29, 33, 37, etc. So 13 is included. Therefore, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But to be thorough, let me attempt to outline why \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is Euclidean. Let&#x27;s consider the norm function \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). Suppose we have two elements \(\alpha, \beta \neq 0\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), and we want to divide \(\alpha\) by \(\beta\).

Compute \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Express \(\xi\) as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\). We need to find \(q = m + n\theta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Let \(x = m + \delta\) and \(y = n + \epsilon\), where \(m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(\delta, \epsilon \in (-1/2, 1/2]\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = (\delta + \epsilon \theta)^2 + (\delta + \epsilon \theta)(\epsilon) - 3\epsilon^2\).

Wait, maybe this approach isn&#x27;t straightforward. Let&#x27;s instead compute the norm directly:

\(N(\xi - q) = (x - m)^2 + (x - m)(y - n) - 3(y - n)^2\).

Let me set \(u = x - m\) and \(v = y - n\), so \(|u| \leq 1/2\) and \(|v| \leq 1/2\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

We need to show that this is less than 1 for some choice of \(m, n\) such that \(|u|, |v| \leq 1/2\).

Wait, but actually, \(u\) and \(v\) can be in the interval \((-1/2, 1/2]\), so we need to check the maximum possible value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) over that square.

But let me compute the maximum value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) for \(u, v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

To find the maximum, we can take partial derivatives. Let \(f(u, v) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

Compute \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = 2u + v\), and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = u - 6v\).

Setting the derivatives to zero:

1. \(2u + v = 0\)
2. \(u - 6v = 0\)

From the second equation: \(u = 6v\). Plugging into the first equation: \(2(6v) + v = 0 \implies 13v = 0 \implies v = 0\). Then \(u = 0\). So the critical point is at (0, 0), which is a minimum? Wait, check the second derivatives.

The Hessian matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; -6
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant is (2)(-6) - (1)(1) = -12 - 1 = -13 &lt; 0. So the critical point at (0,0) is a saddle point. Therefore, the maximum of \(f(u, v)\) on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) occurs on the boundary.

So let&#x27;s check the boundaries.

Case 1: \(u = 1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

Then, \(f(1/2, v) = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 + (1/2)v - 3v^2\).

This is a quadratic in v. The maximum occurs either at the vertex or endpoints.

Vertex at \(v = -b/(2a)\). Here, a = -3, b = 1/2.

So vertex at \(v = -(1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/6 = 1/12\). Within the interval [-1/2, 1/2].

Compute f(1/2, 1/12) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/12) - 3*(1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Convert to 48 denominators:

12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Compute endpoints:

At v = -1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3*(1/4) = 0 - 3/4 = -3/4.

At v = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum on this edge is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Case 2: \(u = -1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(-1/2, v) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 - (1/2)v - 3v^2.

Again, quadratic in v with a = -3, b = -1/2.

Vertex at v = -(-1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/(-6) = -1/12.

Compute f(-1/2, -1/12) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/12) - 3*(-1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Same as before, 12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

At endpoints:

v = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

v = 1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum here is 13/48.

Case 3: \(v = 1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, 1/2) = u^2 + u*(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = u^2 + u/2 - 3/4.

This is quadratic in u, opening upwards. The vertex is at u = -b/(2a) = -(1/2)/(2*1) = -1/4.

Compute f(-1/4, 1/2) = (-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

At endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = -1/4 as before.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum on this edge is -1/4, which is not higher than previous maxima.

Case 4: \(v = -1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, -1/2) = u^2 + u*(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = u^2 - u/2 - 3/4.

Quadratic in u, vertex at u = (1/2)/(2*1) = 1/4.

Compute f(1/4, -1/2) = (1/4)^2 - (1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

Endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = -3/4.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = (-1/2)^2 - (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum here is -1/4.

Case 5: Edges where u or v is fixed at 1/2 or -1/2, but we already covered all edges.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(N(\xi - q)\) over the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708, which is less than 1. Therefore, for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\). Hence, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is norm-Euclidean.

Wait, hold on. If the maximum of \(N(\xi - q)\) is 13/48 which is approximately 0.27, which is definitely less than 1. Therefore, this would imply that the norm is a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring is Euclidean.

But wait, this seems conflicting with my initial uncertainty, but according to the calculation, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain is less than 1, it is Euclidean. Therefore, the answer should be yes, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have two elements in the ring, say \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), and try to divide them. Let&#x27;s take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = 2\). Then, \(\xi = \theta / 2 = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4\). So we need to find \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Express \(\xi\) as \(0 + (1/4)\theta\). So \(x = 0\), \(y = 1/4\). We need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) with integers \(m\) and \(n\). The closest integers to \(x = 0\) is \(m = 0\), and to \(y = 1/4\) is \(n = 0\) or \(n = 1\). Let&#x27;s check both:

If \(n = 0\), then \(q = 0 + 0\theta = 0\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi\), and \(N(\xi) = (0)^2 + (0)(1/4) - 3*(1/4)^2 = -3/16\). The norm is negative, but in absolute value, 3/16, which is less than 1.

But wait, the norm can be negative here? The norm in a real quadratic field is \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\), which can indeed be negative. However, when we talk about the Euclidean function, we usually take the absolute value of the norm. So in this case, |N(\xi - q)| = 3/16 &lt; 1. So this works.

Alternatively, if we take \(n = 1\), then \(q = 0 + 1\theta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi - \theta = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4 - (1 + \sqrt{13})/2 = (-1 - \sqrt{13})/4\). Then, N(\xi - q) = [(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta] has norm:

Let me compute it:

(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta = -1/4 - (1/4)\theta. The norm is:

(-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(-1/4) - 3*(-1/4)^2 = 1/16 + 1/16 - 3/16 = (1 + 1 - 3)/16 = (-1)/16. Absolute value is 1/16, which is even smaller. So either way, the norm is less than 1. Therefore, in this case, we can write \(\theta = 2*0 + r\) where \(N(r) = 3/16 &lt; N(2) = 4\), but actually, in the division, since we are allowed to choose any q, even if the norm is negative, as long as the absolute value is less than N(b). Wait, but in the division algorithm, the remainder can have norm less than that of beta. However, in this case, the norm of beta is N(2) = 4. The remainder here has norm |N(r)| = 3/16, which is less than 4. But actually, in the standard division algorithm, we have \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\). However, in the case of negative norms, perhaps we need to take the absolute value? Wait, the norm here is actually the field norm, which can be positive or negative. But in the context of Euclidean domains, the Euclidean function is usually taken to be the absolute value of the norm.

Wait, but in the case of the Gaussian integers, the norm is always non-negative, so it&#x27;s clear. In real quadratic fields, the norm can be negative, but since we need the Euclidean function to map to non-negative integers, we take the absolute value. Therefore, the Euclidean function here is |N(a)|. Therefore, when we say \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\), it&#x27;s actually |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So even if r has a negative norm, as long as its absolute value is less than |N(b)|, it&#x27;s okay.

But in our calculation above, when we approximated \(\xi = \theta / 2\) by q = 0, we got |N(\(\xi - 0\))| = 3/16 &lt; |N(2)| = 4. Wait, but 3/16 is much less than 4. However, in the division algorithm, we need |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So in this case, 3/16 &lt; 4, so it&#x27;s fine. Therefore, the division works.

Another example: take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, dividing \(\theta\) by \(\theta\), we get \(\xi = 1\), which is already in the ring, so the remainder is 0.

Alternatively, take \(\alpha = 1 + \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi = (1 + \theta)/\theta = 1/\theta + 1\). Since \(\theta\) satisfies \(\theta^2 = \theta + 3\), so \(1/\theta = (\theta - 1)/3\). Therefore, \(\xi = (\theta - 1)/3 + 1 = (theta - 1 + 3)/3 = (theta + 2)/3. So approximate this by some q in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\). Let me compute the numerical values.

theta = (1 + sqrt(13))/2 ≈ (1 + 3.6055)/2 ≈ 4.6055/2 ≈ 2.30275.

So xi = (theta + 2)/3 ≈ (2.30275 + 2)/3 ≈ 4.30275/3 ≈ 1.43425.

So in terms of the basis {1, theta}, xi is approximately 1.43425. So express this as x + y theta, where x and y are rational numbers. Wait, but xi = (theta + 2)/3, which is (2)/3 + (1)/3 theta. So x = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 and y = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333. So we need to approximate x and y with integers m and n. The closest integers to x = 2/3 is m = 1 or 0. If we take m = 1, then n should be 0 or 1? Wait, y = 1/3. The closest integer to 1/3 is 0. So maybe take m = 1, n = 0. Then, q = 1 + 0*theta = 1. Then, the remainder is xi - q = (2/3 - 1) + (1/3 - 0) theta = (-1/3) + (1/3) theta. The norm of this is:

N(-1/3 + (1/3)theta) = (-1/3)^2 + (-1/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 1/9 - 1/9 - 3/9 = (-3)/9 = -1/3. Absolute value is 1/3, which is less than |N(beta)| = |N(theta)| = |1^2 + 1*1 - 3*1^2| = |1 + 1 - 3| = |-1| = 1. So 1/3 &lt; 1, which works. Therefore, the remainder has norm less than that of beta, so the division works.

Alternatively, if we choose m = 0 and n = 0, then q = 0. The remainder is xi - 0 = xi, whose norm is:

N(2/3 + (1/3)theta) = (2/3)^2 + (2/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 4/9 + 2/9 - 3/9 = (4 + 2 - 3)/9 = 3/9 = 1/3. Absolute value 1/3 &lt; 1. So either way, we get a remainder with smaller norm.

Therefore, these examples support the conclusion that the ring is Euclidean.

Additionally, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain was found to be 13/48 ≈ 0.27, which is less than 1, this implies that the ring is indeed norm-Euclidean.

Therefore, after this thorough check, I can conclude that \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain, we start by noting that this ring is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). The element \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\) is an algebraic integer with minimal polynomial \(x^2 - x - 3\), which confirms that \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is indeed the ring of integers.

A key property of Euclidean domains is the existence of a Euclidean function, typically the absolute value of the norm in quadratic fields. For the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), the norm of an element \(a + b\theta\) is given by \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). 

To verify the Euclidean property, we need to show that for any elements \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exist \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\). This is equivalent to showing that for any \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

By analyzing the norm function and checking the maximum value of \(N(\xi - \gamma)\) over the fundamental domain, we find that the maximum norm on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is \(\frac{13}{48}\), which is less than 1. This ensures that for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that the norm of the remainder is less than the norm of \(\beta\).

Examples and calculations confirm that the division algorithm holds, and the norm function serves as a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain. Hmm, let&#x27;s start by recalling some definitions. A Euclidean domain is an integral domain where we can perform the Euclidean algorithm, which basically means there&#x27;s a way to measure the &quot;size&quot; of elements (called a Euclidean function) such that for any two elements \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b \neq 0\)), there exist \(q\) and \(r\) where \(a = bq + r\) and either \(r = 0\) or the size of \(r\) is less than the size of \(b\).

First, let me make sure I understand the ring in question. The ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) consists of all numbers of the form \(a + b\left(\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers. Let me simplify that expression a bit. Let me denote \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\). So the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\).

I know that \(\theta\) is a root of a quadratic equation. Let me find its minimal polynomial. If \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\), then multiplying both sides by 2 gives \(2\theta = \sqrt{13} + 1\). Rearranging, \(\sqrt{13} = 2\theta - 1\). Squaring both sides, \(13 = (2\theta - 1)^2 = 4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1\). Then, moving everything to one side: \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1 - 13 = 0\), so \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta - 12 = 0\). Dividing both sides by 4: \(\theta^2 - \theta - 3 = 0\). So the minimal polynomial is \(x^2 - x - 3\). Therefore, \(\theta\) is an algebraic integer of degree 2, which means \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Wait, hold on. The ring of integers in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is typically \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{d}}{2}\right]\) when \(d \equiv 1 \mod 4\), and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]\) otherwise. Here, \(d = 13\), which is 1 mod 4, so the ring of integers should be \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). But in our case, the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\), which is the same as \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). So actually, this ring is the full ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Therefore, we are dealing with the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Now, I need to recall whether this ring is a Euclidean domain. I know that for quadratic fields, some rings of integers are Euclidean, and others are not. For example, \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) (Gaussian integers) and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]\) are Euclidean, but others like \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]\) are not even UFDs.

But since 13 is a positive square-free integer, we&#x27;re dealing with a real quadratic field. Now, the question is whether its ring of integers is Euclidean with respect to the norm. Sometimes real quadratic fields are Euclidean, sometimes not. I remember that for small discriminants, like 5, 8, 12, etc., some are Euclidean. But I need to check specifically for 13.

Wait, let me recall: The Minkowski bound for the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) can be used to check whether it is a PID. If the class number is 1, then it is a PID. Now, Euclidean domains are PIDs, but not all PIDs are Euclidean. So even if the class number is 1, it might not be Euclidean. But for some quadratic fields, it&#x27;s known whether they are Euclidean.

Looking up my memory, I think that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) has class number 1. Let me verify that. For real quadratic fields, the class number is more complicated, but I recall that 13 is a prime where the class number is 1. Wait, primes like 5, 13, 17... Hmm, I need to be careful. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\) has class number 1, but \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{10})\) does not. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall specific results. According to what I remember, the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed a PID, hence has class number 1. But is it Euclidean? Some references say that for real quadratic fields, Euclideanity is known for certain cases. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7})\), and some others are Euclidean with respect to the norm. However, for 13, I need to check.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: A real quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is norm-Euclidean if and only if \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, 73\). Wait, but I might be mixing up different sources. Let me verify.

Actually, according to some references, the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields are those with \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37,\) and \( 73\). So 13 is included here. Wait, but I need to check if this is accurate.

Alternatively, I can check specific literature. For example, in the case of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), the ring of integers is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\), which is the same as our ring. Now, according to some sources, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is norm-Euclidean. Let me recall that the norm in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is given by \(N(a + b\sqrt{d}) = a^2 - db^2\). But in our case, since the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) where \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the norm would be \(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;)\), where \(\theta&#x27;\) is the conjugate of \(\theta\). Since \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the conjugate is \(\theta&#x27; = \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}\). So expanding the norm:

\(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;) = a^2 + ab(\theta + \theta&#x27;) + b^2 \theta \theta&#x27;\).

We know from the minimal polynomial that \(\theta + \theta&#x27; = 1\) (since the coefficient of \(x\) in \(x^2 - x - 3\) is -1, so sum of roots is 1) and \(\theta \theta&#x27; = -3\) (the constant term). Therefore:

\(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab(1) + b^2(-3) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\).

So the norm here is \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). For the ring to be Euclidean, given any elements \(a\) and \(b\) in the ring (\(b \neq 0\)), there should exist \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\).

So to prove it&#x27;s Euclidean, we need to show that for any \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exists \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\).

Alternatively, this can sometimes be approached by showing that for any element \(\alpha / \beta\) in \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists an element \(\gamma\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\alpha/\beta - \gamma) &lt; 1\). This is equivalent to the ring being Euclidean, as the norm is multiplicative.

So, let me think about this. For any element \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), we need to find \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

Since \(\xi\) can be written as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\), we need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) by integers such that the norm of \((x - a) + (y - b)\theta\) is less than 1.

Let me write \(\xi = s + t\theta\), where \(s, t \in \mathbb{Q}\). Then, the norm of \(\xi - \gamma\) where \(\gamma = a + b\theta\) is:

\(N((s - a) + (t - b)\theta) = (s - a)^2 + (s - a)(t - b) - 3(t - b)^2\).

We need this to be less than 1.

To ensure this, we need to find integers \(a, b\) such that \(|s - a|\) and \(|t - b|\) are small enough such that the above expression is less than 1.

Alternatively, since \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is a lattice in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), the problem reduces to covering the plane with regions around each lattice point such that every point in the plane is within a distance less than 1 (in the norm) from some lattice point. If such a covering is possible, then the ring is Euclidean.

But visualizing this for the norm \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\) might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can use the geometry of numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I can check known results. If \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is known to be norm-Euclidean, then the answer is yes. Let me check my memory again. I recall that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed one of the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields. For example, according to the book &quot;Introductory Algebraic Number Theory&quot; by Alaca and Williams, the list of norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields includes those with discriminant 5, 8, 12, 13, 17, 21, 24, 28, 29, 33, 37, etc. So 13 is included. Therefore, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But to be thorough, let me attempt to outline why \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is Euclidean. Let&#x27;s consider the norm function \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). Suppose we have two elements \(\alpha, \beta \neq 0\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), and we want to divide \(\alpha\) by \(\beta\).

Compute \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Express \(\xi\) as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\). We need to find \(q = m + n\theta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Let \(x = m + \delta\) and \(y = n + \epsilon\), where \(m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(\delta, \epsilon \in (-1/2, 1/2]\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = (\delta + \epsilon \theta)^2 + (\delta + \epsilon \theta)(\epsilon) - 3\epsilon^2\).

Wait, maybe this approach isn&#x27;t straightforward. Let&#x27;s instead compute the norm directly:

\(N(\xi - q) = (x - m)^2 + (x - m)(y - n) - 3(y - n)^2\).

Let me set \(u = x - m\) and \(v = y - n\), so \(|u| \leq 1/2\) and \(|v| \leq 1/2\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

We need to show that this is less than 1 for some choice of \(m, n\) such that \(|u|, |v| \leq 1/2\).

Wait, but actually, \(u\) and \(v\) can be in the interval \((-1/2, 1/2]\), so we need to check the maximum possible value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) over that square.

But let me compute the maximum value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) for \(u, v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

To find the maximum, we can take partial derivatives. Let \(f(u, v) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

Compute \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = 2u + v\), and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = u - 6v\).

Setting the derivatives to zero:

1. \(2u + v = 0\)
2. \(u - 6v = 0\)

From the second equation: \(u = 6v\). Plugging into the first equation: \(2(6v) + v = 0 \implies 13v = 0 \implies v = 0\). Then \(u = 0\). So the critical point is at (0, 0), which is a minimum? Wait, check the second derivatives.

The Hessian matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; -6
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant is (2)(-6) - (1)(1) = -12 - 1 = -13 &lt; 0. So the critical point at (0,0) is a saddle point. Therefore, the maximum of \(f(u, v)\) on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) occurs on the boundary.

So let&#x27;s check the boundaries.

Case 1: \(u = 1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

Then, \(f(1/2, v) = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 + (1/2)v - 3v^2\).

This is a quadratic in v. The maximum occurs either at the vertex or endpoints.

Vertex at \(v = -b/(2a)\). Here, a = -3, b = 1/2.

So vertex at \(v = -(1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/6 = 1/12\). Within the interval [-1/2, 1/2].

Compute f(1/2, 1/12) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/12) - 3*(1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Convert to 48 denominators:

12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Compute endpoints:

At v = -1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3*(1/4) = 0 - 3/4 = -3/4.

At v = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum on this edge is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Case 2: \(u = -1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(-1/2, v) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 - (1/2)v - 3v^2.

Again, quadratic in v with a = -3, b = -1/2.

Vertex at v = -(-1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/(-6) = -1/12.

Compute f(-1/2, -1/12) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/12) - 3*(-1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Same as before, 12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

At endpoints:

v = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

v = 1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum here is 13/48.

Case 3: \(v = 1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, 1/2) = u^2 + u*(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = u^2 + u/2 - 3/4.

This is quadratic in u, opening upwards. The vertex is at u = -b/(2a) = -(1/2)/(2*1) = -1/4.

Compute f(-1/4, 1/2) = (-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

At endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = -1/4 as before.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum on this edge is -1/4, which is not higher than previous maxima.

Case 4: \(v = -1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, -1/2) = u^2 + u*(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = u^2 - u/2 - 3/4.

Quadratic in u, vertex at u = (1/2)/(2*1) = 1/4.

Compute f(1/4, -1/2) = (1/4)^2 - (1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

Endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = -3/4.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = (-1/2)^2 - (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum here is -1/4.

Case 5: Edges where u or v is fixed at 1/2 or -1/2, but we already covered all edges.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(N(\xi - q)\) over the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708, which is less than 1. Therefore, for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\). Hence, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is norm-Euclidean.

Wait, hold on. If the maximum of \(N(\xi - q)\) is 13/48 which is approximately 0.27, which is definitely less than 1. Therefore, this would imply that the norm is a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring is Euclidean.

But wait, this seems conflicting with my initial uncertainty, but according to the calculation, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain is less than 1, it is Euclidean. Therefore, the answer should be yes, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have two elements in the ring, say \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), and try to divide them. Let&#x27;s take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = 2\). Then, \(\xi = \theta / 2 = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4\). So we need to find \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Express \(\xi\) as \(0 + (1/4)\theta\). So \(x = 0\), \(y = 1/4\). We need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) with integers \(m\) and \(n\). The closest integers to \(x = 0\) is \(m = 0\), and to \(y = 1/4\) is \(n = 0\) or \(n = 1\). Let&#x27;s check both:

If \(n = 0\), then \(q = 0 + 0\theta = 0\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi\), and \(N(\xi) = (0)^2 + (0)(1/4) - 3*(1/4)^2 = -3/16\). The norm is negative, but in absolute value, 3/16, which is less than 1.

But wait, the norm can be negative here? The norm in a real quadratic field is \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\), which can indeed be negative. However, when we talk about the Euclidean function, we usually take the absolute value of the norm. So in this case, |N(\xi - q)| = 3/16 &lt; 1. So this works.

Alternatively, if we take \(n = 1\), then \(q = 0 + 1\theta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi - \theta = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4 - (1 + \sqrt{13})/2 = (-1 - \sqrt{13})/4\). Then, N(\xi - q) = [(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta] has norm:

Let me compute it:

(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta = -1/4 - (1/4)\theta. The norm is:

(-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(-1/4) - 3*(-1/4)^2 = 1/16 + 1/16 - 3/16 = (1 + 1 - 3)/16 = (-1)/16. Absolute value is 1/16, which is even smaller. So either way, the norm is less than 1. Therefore, in this case, we can write \(\theta = 2*0 + r\) where \(N(r) = 3/16 &lt; N(2) = 4\), but actually, in the division, since we are allowed to choose any q, even if the norm is negative, as long as the absolute value is less than N(b). Wait, but in the division algorithm, the remainder can have norm less than that of beta. However, in this case, the norm of beta is N(2) = 4. The remainder here has norm |N(r)| = 3/16, which is less than 4. But actually, in the standard division algorithm, we have \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\). However, in the case of negative norms, perhaps we need to take the absolute value? Wait, the norm here is actually the field norm, which can be positive or negative. But in the context of Euclidean domains, the Euclidean function is usually taken to be the absolute value of the norm.

Wait, but in the case of the Gaussian integers, the norm is always non-negative, so it&#x27;s clear. In real quadratic fields, the norm can be negative, but since we need the Euclidean function to map to non-negative integers, we take the absolute value. Therefore, the Euclidean function here is |N(a)|. Therefore, when we say \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\), it&#x27;s actually |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So even if r has a negative norm, as long as its absolute value is less than |N(b)|, it&#x27;s okay.

But in our calculation above, when we approximated \(\xi = \theta / 2\) by q = 0, we got |N(\(\xi - 0\))| = 3/16 &lt; |N(2)| = 4. Wait, but 3/16 is much less than 4. However, in the division algorithm, we need |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So in this case, 3/16 &lt; 4, so it&#x27;s fine. Therefore, the division works.

Another example: take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, dividing \(\theta\) by \(\theta\), we get \(\xi = 1\), which is already in the ring, so the remainder is 0.

Alternatively, take \(\alpha = 1 + \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi = (1 + \theta)/\theta = 1/\theta + 1\). Since \(\theta\) satisfies \(\theta^2 = \theta + 3\), so \(1/\theta = (\theta - 1)/3\). Therefore, \(\xi = (\theta - 1)/3 + 1 = (theta - 1 + 3)/3 = (theta + 2)/3. So approximate this by some q in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\). Let me compute the numerical values.

theta = (1 + sqrt(13))/2 ≈ (1 + 3.6055)/2 ≈ 4.6055/2 ≈ 2.30275.

So xi = (theta + 2)/3 ≈ (2.30275 + 2)/3 ≈ 4.30275/3 ≈ 1.43425.

So in terms of the basis {1, theta}, xi is approximately 1.43425. So express this as x + y theta, where x and y are rational numbers. Wait, but xi = (theta + 2)/3, which is (2)/3 + (1)/3 theta. So x = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 and y = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333. So we need to approximate x and y with integers m and n. The closest integers to x = 2/3 is m = 1 or 0. If we take m = 1, then n should be 0 or 1? Wait, y = 1/3. The closest integer to 1/3 is 0. So maybe take m = 1, n = 0. Then, q = 1 + 0*theta = 1. Then, the remainder is xi - q = (2/3 - 1) + (1/3 - 0) theta = (-1/3) + (1/3) theta. The norm of this is:

N(-1/3 + (1/3)theta) = (-1/3)^2 + (-1/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 1/9 - 1/9 - 3/9 = (-3)/9 = -1/3. Absolute value is 1/3, which is less than |N(beta)| = |N(theta)| = |1^2 + 1*1 - 3*1^2| = |1 + 1 - 3| = |-1| = 1. So 1/3 &lt; 1, which works. Therefore, the remainder has norm less than that of beta, so the division works.

Alternatively, if we choose m = 0 and n = 0, then q = 0. The remainder is xi - 0 = xi, whose norm is:

N(2/3 + (1/3)theta) = (2/3)^2 + (2/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 4/9 + 2/9 - 3/9 = (4 + 2 - 3)/9 = 3/9 = 1/3. Absolute value 1/3 &lt; 1. So either way, we get a remainder with smaller norm.

Therefore, these examples support the conclusion that the ring is Euclidean.

Additionally, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain was found to be 13/48 ≈ 0.27, which is less than 1, this implies that the ring is indeed norm-Euclidean.

Therefore, after this thorough check, I can conclude that \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}

To determine whether the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain, we start by noting that this ring is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). The element \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\) is an algebraic integer with minimal polynomial \(x^2 - x - 3\), which confirms that \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is indeed the ring of integers.

A key property of Euclidean domains is the existence of a Euclidean function, typically the absolute value of the norm in quadratic fields. For the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), the norm of an element \(a + b\theta\) is given by \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). 

To verify the Euclidean property, we need to show that for any elements \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exist \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\). This is equivalent to showing that for any \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

By analyzing the norm function and checking the maximum value of \(N(\xi - \gamma)\) over the fundamental domain, we find that the maximum norm on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is \(\frac{13}{48}\), which is less than 1. This ensures that for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that the norm of the remainder is less than the norm of \(\beta\).

Examples and calculations confirm that the division algorithm holds, and the norm function serves as a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain. Hmm, let&#x27;s start by recalling some definitions. A Euclidean domain is an integral domain where we can perform the Euclidean algorithm, which basically means there&#x27;s a way to measure the &quot;size&quot; of elements (called a Euclidean function) such that for any two elements \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b \neq 0\)), there exist \(q\) and \(r\) where \(a = bq + r\) and either \(r = 0\) or the size of \(r\) is less than the size of \(b\).

First, let me make sure I understand the ring in question. The ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) consists of all numbers of the form \(a + b\left(\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers. Let me simplify that expression a bit. Let me denote \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\). So the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\).

I know that \(\theta\) is a root of a quadratic equation. Let me find its minimal polynomial. If \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\), then multiplying both sides by 2 gives \(2\theta = \sqrt{13} + 1\). Rearranging, \(\sqrt{13} = 2\theta - 1\). Squaring both sides, \(13 = (2\theta - 1)^2 = 4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1\). Then, moving everything to one side: \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1 - 13 = 0\), so \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta - 12 = 0\). Dividing both sides by 4: \(\theta^2 - \theta - 3 = 0\). So the minimal polynomial is \(x^2 - x - 3\). Therefore, \(\theta\) is an algebraic integer of degree 2, which means \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Wait, hold on. The ring of integers in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is typically \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{d}}{2}\right]\) when \(d \equiv 1 \mod 4\), and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]\) otherwise. Here, \(d = 13\), which is 1 mod 4, so the ring of integers should be \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). But in our case, the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\), which is the same as \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). So actually, this ring is the full ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Therefore, we are dealing with the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Now, I need to recall whether this ring is a Euclidean domain. I know that for quadratic fields, some rings of integers are Euclidean, and others are not. For example, \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) (Gaussian integers) and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]\) are Euclidean, but others like \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]\) are not even UFDs.

But since 13 is a positive square-free integer, we&#x27;re dealing with a real quadratic field. Now, the question is whether its ring of integers is Euclidean with respect to the norm. Sometimes real quadratic fields are Euclidean, sometimes not. I remember that for small discriminants, like 5, 8, 12, etc., some are Euclidean. But I need to check specifically for 13.

Wait, let me recall: The Minkowski bound for the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) can be used to check whether it is a PID. If the class number is 1, then it is a PID. Now, Euclidean domains are PIDs, but not all PIDs are Euclidean. So even if the class number is 1, it might not be Euclidean. But for some quadratic fields, it&#x27;s known whether they are Euclidean.

Looking up my memory, I think that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) has class number 1. Let me verify that. For real quadratic fields, the class number is more complicated, but I recall that 13 is a prime where the class number is 1. Wait, primes like 5, 13, 17... Hmm, I need to be careful. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\) has class number 1, but \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{10})\) does not. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall specific results. According to what I remember, the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed a PID, hence has class number 1. But is it Euclidean? Some references say that for real quadratic fields, Euclideanity is known for certain cases. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7})\), and some others are Euclidean with respect to the norm. However, for 13, I need to check.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: A real quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is norm-Euclidean if and only if \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, 73\). Wait, but I might be mixing up different sources. Let me verify.

Actually, according to some references, the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields are those with \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37,\) and \( 73\). So 13 is included here. Wait, but I need to check if this is accurate.

Alternatively, I can check specific literature. For example, in the case of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), the ring of integers is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\), which is the same as our ring. Now, according to some sources, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is norm-Euclidean. Let me recall that the norm in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is given by \(N(a + b\sqrt{d}) = a^2 - db^2\). But in our case, since the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) where \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the norm would be \(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;)\), where \(\theta&#x27;\) is the conjugate of \(\theta\). Since \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the conjugate is \(\theta&#x27; = \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}\). So expanding the norm:

\(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;) = a^2 + ab(\theta + \theta&#x27;) + b^2 \theta \theta&#x27;\).

We know from the minimal polynomial that \(\theta + \theta&#x27; = 1\) (since the coefficient of \(x\) in \(x^2 - x - 3\) is -1, so sum of roots is 1) and \(\theta \theta&#x27; = -3\) (the constant term). Therefore:

\(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab(1) + b^2(-3) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\).

So the norm here is \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). For the ring to be Euclidean, given any elements \(a\) and \(b\) in the ring (\(b \neq 0\)), there should exist \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\).

So to prove it&#x27;s Euclidean, we need to show that for any \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exists \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\).

Alternatively, this can sometimes be approached by showing that for any element \(\alpha / \beta\) in \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists an element \(\gamma\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\alpha/\beta - \gamma) &lt; 1\). This is equivalent to the ring being Euclidean, as the norm is multiplicative.

So, let me think about this. For any element \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), we need to find \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

Since \(\xi\) can be written as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\), we need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) by integers such that the norm of \((x - a) + (y - b)\theta\) is less than 1.

Let me write \(\xi = s + t\theta\), where \(s, t \in \mathbb{Q}\). Then, the norm of \(\xi - \gamma\) where \(\gamma = a + b\theta\) is:

\(N((s - a) + (t - b)\theta) = (s - a)^2 + (s - a)(t - b) - 3(t - b)^2\).

We need this to be less than 1.

To ensure this, we need to find integers \(a, b\) such that \(|s - a|\) and \(|t - b|\) are small enough such that the above expression is less than 1.

Alternatively, since \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is a lattice in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), the problem reduces to covering the plane with regions around each lattice point such that every point in the plane is within a distance less than 1 (in the norm) from some lattice point. If such a covering is possible, then the ring is Euclidean.

But visualizing this for the norm \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\) might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can use the geometry of numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I can check known results. If \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is known to be norm-Euclidean, then the answer is yes. Let me check my memory again. I recall that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed one of the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields. For example, according to the book &quot;Introductory Algebraic Number Theory&quot; by Alaca and Williams, the list of norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields includes those with discriminant 5, 8, 12, 13, 17, 21, 24, 28, 29, 33, 37, etc. So 13 is included. Therefore, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But to be thorough, let me attempt to outline why \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is Euclidean. Let&#x27;s consider the norm function \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). Suppose we have two elements \(\alpha, \beta \neq 0\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), and we want to divide \(\alpha\) by \(\beta\).

Compute \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Express \(\xi\) as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\). We need to find \(q = m + n\theta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Let \(x = m + \delta\) and \(y = n + \epsilon\), where \(m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(\delta, \epsilon \in (-1/2, 1/2]\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = (\delta + \epsilon \theta)^2 + (\delta + \epsilon \theta)(\epsilon) - 3\epsilon^2\).

Wait, maybe this approach isn&#x27;t straightforward. Let&#x27;s instead compute the norm directly:

\(N(\xi - q) = (x - m)^2 + (x - m)(y - n) - 3(y - n)^2\).

Let me set \(u = x - m\) and \(v = y - n\), so \(|u| \leq 1/2\) and \(|v| \leq 1/2\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

We need to show that this is less than 1 for some choice of \(m, n\) such that \(|u|, |v| \leq 1/2\).

Wait, but actually, \(u\) and \(v\) can be in the interval \((-1/2, 1/2]\), so we need to check the maximum possible value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) over that square.

But let me compute the maximum value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) for \(u, v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

To find the maximum, we can take partial derivatives. Let \(f(u, v) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

Compute \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = 2u + v\), and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = u - 6v\).

Setting the derivatives to zero:

1. \(2u + v = 0\)
2. \(u - 6v = 0\)

From the second equation: \(u = 6v\). Plugging into the first equation: \(2(6v) + v = 0 \implies 13v = 0 \implies v = 0\). Then \(u = 0\). So the critical point is at (0, 0), which is a minimum? Wait, check the second derivatives.

The Hessian matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; -6
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant is (2)(-6) - (1)(1) = -12 - 1 = -13 &lt; 0. So the critical point at (0,0) is a saddle point. Therefore, the maximum of \(f(u, v)\) on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) occurs on the boundary.

So let&#x27;s check the boundaries.

Case 1: \(u = 1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

Then, \(f(1/2, v) = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 + (1/2)v - 3v^2\).

This is a quadratic in v. The maximum occurs either at the vertex or endpoints.

Vertex at \(v = -b/(2a)\). Here, a = -3, b = 1/2.

So vertex at \(v = -(1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/6 = 1/12\). Within the interval [-1/2, 1/2].

Compute f(1/2, 1/12) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/12) - 3*(1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Convert to 48 denominators:

12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Compute endpoints:

At v = -1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3*(1/4) = 0 - 3/4 = -3/4.

At v = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum on this edge is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Case 2: \(u = -1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(-1/2, v) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 - (1/2)v - 3v^2.

Again, quadratic in v with a = -3, b = -1/2.

Vertex at v = -(-1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/(-6) = -1/12.

Compute f(-1/2, -1/12) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/12) - 3*(-1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Same as before, 12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

At endpoints:

v = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

v = 1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum here is 13/48.

Case 3: \(v = 1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, 1/2) = u^2 + u*(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = u^2 + u/2 - 3/4.

This is quadratic in u, opening upwards. The vertex is at u = -b/(2a) = -(1/2)/(2*1) = -1/4.

Compute f(-1/4, 1/2) = (-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

At endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = -1/4 as before.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum on this edge is -1/4, which is not higher than previous maxima.

Case 4: \(v = -1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, -1/2) = u^2 + u*(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = u^2 - u/2 - 3/4.

Quadratic in u, vertex at u = (1/2)/(2*1) = 1/4.

Compute f(1/4, -1/2) = (1/4)^2 - (1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

Endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = -3/4.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = (-1/2)^2 - (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum here is -1/4.

Case 5: Edges where u or v is fixed at 1/2 or -1/2, but we already covered all edges.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(N(\xi - q)\) over the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708, which is less than 1. Therefore, for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\). Hence, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is norm-Euclidean.

Wait, hold on. If the maximum of \(N(\xi - q)\) is 13/48 which is approximately 0.27, which is definitely less than 1. Therefore, this would imply that the norm is a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring is Euclidean.

But wait, this seems conflicting with my initial uncertainty, but according to the calculation, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain is less than 1, it is Euclidean. Therefore, the answer should be yes, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have two elements in the ring, say \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), and try to divide them. Let&#x27;s take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = 2\). Then, \(\xi = \theta / 2 = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4\). So we need to find \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Express \(\xi\) as \(0 + (1/4)\theta\). So \(x = 0\), \(y = 1/4\). We need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) with integers \(m\) and \(n\). The closest integers to \(x = 0\) is \(m = 0\), and to \(y = 1/4\) is \(n = 0\) or \(n = 1\). Let&#x27;s check both:

If \(n = 0\), then \(q = 0 + 0\theta = 0\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi\), and \(N(\xi) = (0)^2 + (0)(1/4) - 3*(1/4)^2 = -3/16\). The norm is negative, but in absolute value, 3/16, which is less than 1.

But wait, the norm can be negative here? The norm in a real quadratic field is \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\), which can indeed be negative. However, when we talk about the Euclidean function, we usually take the absolute value of the norm. So in this case, |N(\xi - q)| = 3/16 &lt; 1. So this works.

Alternatively, if we take \(n = 1\), then \(q = 0 + 1\theta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi - \theta = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4 - (1 + \sqrt{13})/2 = (-1 - \sqrt{13})/4\). Then, N(\xi - q) = [(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta] has norm:

Let me compute it:

(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta = -1/4 - (1/4)\theta. The norm is:

(-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(-1/4) - 3*(-1/4)^2 = 1/16 + 1/16 - 3/16 = (1 + 1 - 3)/16 = (-1)/16. Absolute value is 1/16, which is even smaller. So either way, the norm is less than 1. Therefore, in this case, we can write \(\theta = 2*0 + r\) where \(N(r) = 3/16 &lt; N(2) = 4\), but actually, in the division, since we are allowed to choose any q, even if the norm is negative, as long as the absolute value is less than N(b). Wait, but in the division algorithm, the remainder can have norm less than that of beta. However, in this case, the norm of beta is N(2) = 4. The remainder here has norm |N(r)| = 3/16, which is less than 4. But actually, in the standard division algorithm, we have \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\). However, in the case of negative norms, perhaps we need to take the absolute value? Wait, the norm here is actually the field norm, which can be positive or negative. But in the context of Euclidean domains, the Euclidean function is usually taken to be the absolute value of the norm.

Wait, but in the case of the Gaussian integers, the norm is always non-negative, so it&#x27;s clear. In real quadratic fields, the norm can be negative, but since we need the Euclidean function to map to non-negative integers, we take the absolute value. Therefore, the Euclidean function here is |N(a)|. Therefore, when we say \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\), it&#x27;s actually |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So even if r has a negative norm, as long as its absolute value is less than |N(b)|, it&#x27;s okay.

But in our calculation above, when we approximated \(\xi = \theta / 2\) by q = 0, we got |N(\(\xi - 0\))| = 3/16 &lt; |N(2)| = 4. Wait, but 3/16 is much less than 4. However, in the division algorithm, we need |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So in this case, 3/16 &lt; 4, so it&#x27;s fine. Therefore, the division works.

Another example: take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, dividing \(\theta\) by \(\theta\), we get \(\xi = 1\), which is already in the ring, so the remainder is 0.

Alternatively, take \(\alpha = 1 + \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi = (1 + \theta)/\theta = 1/\theta + 1\). Since \(\theta\) satisfies \(\theta^2 = \theta + 3\), so \(1/\theta = (\theta - 1)/3\). Therefore, \(\xi = (\theta - 1)/3 + 1 = (theta - 1 + 3)/3 = (theta + 2)/3. So approximate this by some q in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\). Let me compute the numerical values.

theta = (1 + sqrt(13))/2 ≈ (1 + 3.6055)/2 ≈ 4.6055/2 ≈ 2.30275.

So xi = (theta + 2)/3 ≈ (2.30275 + 2)/3 ≈ 4.30275/3 ≈ 1.43425.

So in terms of the basis {1, theta}, xi is approximately 1.43425. So express this as x + y theta, where x and y are rational numbers. Wait, but xi = (theta + 2)/3, which is (2)/3 + (1)/3 theta. So x = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 and y = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333. So we need to approximate x and y with integers m and n. The closest integers to x = 2/3 is m = 1 or 0. If we take m = 1, then n should be 0 or 1? Wait, y = 1/3. The closest integer to 1/3 is 0. So maybe take m = 1, n = 0. Then, q = 1 + 0*theta = 1. Then, the remainder is xi - q = (2/3 - 1) + (1/3 - 0) theta = (-1/3) + (1/3) theta. The norm of this is:

N(-1/3 + (1/3)theta) = (-1/3)^2 + (-1/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 1/9 - 1/9 - 3/9 = (-3)/9 = -1/3. Absolute value is 1/3, which is less than |N(beta)| = |N(theta)| = |1^2 + 1*1 - 3*1^2| = |1 + 1 - 3| = |-1| = 1. So 1/3 &lt; 1, which works. Therefore, the remainder has norm less than that of beta, so the division works.

Alternatively, if we choose m = 0 and n = 0, then q = 0. The remainder is xi - 0 = xi, whose norm is:

N(2/3 + (1/3)theta) = (2/3)^2 + (2/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 4/9 + 2/9 - 3/9 = (4 + 2 - 3)/9 = 3/9 = 1/3. Absolute value 1/3 &lt; 1. So either way, we get a remainder with smaller norm.

Therefore, these examples support the conclusion that the ring is Euclidean.

Additionally, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain was found to be 13/48 ≈ 0.27, which is less than 1, this implies that the ring is indeed norm-Euclidean.

Therefore, after this thorough check, I can conclude that \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain, we start by noting that this ring is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). The element \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\) is an algebraic integer with minimal polynomial \(x^2 - x - 3\), which confirms that \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is indeed the ring of integers.

A key property of Euclidean domains is the existence of a Euclidean function, typically the absolute value of the norm in quadratic fields. For the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), the norm of an element \(a + b\theta\) is given by \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). 

To verify the Euclidean property, we need to show that for any elements \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exist \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\). This is equivalent to showing that for any \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

By analyzing the norm function and checking the maximum value of \(N(\xi - \gamma)\) over the fundamental domain, we find that the maximum norm on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is \(\frac{13}{48}\), which is less than 1. This ensures that for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that the norm of the remainder is less than the norm of \(\beta\).

Examples and calculations confirm that the division algorithm holds, and the norm function serves as a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain. Hmm, let&#x27;s start by recalling some definitions. A Euclidean domain is an integral domain where we can perform the Euclidean algorithm, which basically means there&#x27;s a way to measure the &quot;size&quot; of elements (called a Euclidean function) such that for any two elements \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b \neq 0\)), there exist \(q\) and \(r\) where \(a = bq + r\) and either \(r = 0\) or the size of \(r\) is less than the size of \(b\).

First, let me make sure I understand the ring in question. The ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) consists of all numbers of the form \(a + b\left(\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers. Let me simplify that expression a bit. Let me denote \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\). So the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\).

I know that \(\theta\) is a root of a quadratic equation. Let me find its minimal polynomial. If \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\), then multiplying both sides by 2 gives \(2\theta = \sqrt{13} + 1\). Rearranging, \(\sqrt{13} = 2\theta - 1\). Squaring both sides, \(13 = (2\theta - 1)^2 = 4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1\). Then, moving everything to one side: \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1 - 13 = 0\), so \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta - 12 = 0\). Dividing both sides by 4: \(\theta^2 - \theta - 3 = 0\). So the minimal polynomial is \(x^2 - x - 3\). Therefore, \(\theta\) is an algebraic integer of degree 2, which means \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Wait, hold on. The ring of integers in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is typically \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{d}}{2}\right]\) when \(d \equiv 1 \mod 4\), and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]\) otherwise. Here, \(d = 13\), which is 1 mod 4, so the ring of integers should be \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). But in our case, the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\), which is the same as \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). So actually, this ring is the full ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Therefore, we are dealing with the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Now, I need to recall whether this ring is a Euclidean domain. I know that for quadratic fields, some rings of integers are Euclidean, and others are not. For example, \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) (Gaussian integers) and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]\) are Euclidean, but others like \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]\) are not even UFDs.

But since 13 is a positive square-free integer, we&#x27;re dealing with a real quadratic field. Now, the question is whether its ring of integers is Euclidean with respect to the norm. Sometimes real quadratic fields are Euclidean, sometimes not. I remember that for small discriminants, like 5, 8, 12, etc., some are Euclidean. But I need to check specifically for 13.

Wait, let me recall: The Minkowski bound for the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) can be used to check whether it is a PID. If the class number is 1, then it is a PID. Now, Euclidean domains are PIDs, but not all PIDs are Euclidean. So even if the class number is 1, it might not be Euclidean. But for some quadratic fields, it&#x27;s known whether they are Euclidean.

Looking up my memory, I think that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) has class number 1. Let me verify that. For real quadratic fields, the class number is more complicated, but I recall that 13 is a prime where the class number is 1. Wait, primes like 5, 13, 17... Hmm, I need to be careful. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\) has class number 1, but \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{10})\) does not. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall specific results. According to what I remember, the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed a PID, hence has class number 1. But is it Euclidean? Some references say that for real quadratic fields, Euclideanity is known for certain cases. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7})\), and some others are Euclidean with respect to the norm. However, for 13, I need to check.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: A real quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is norm-Euclidean if and only if \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, 73\). Wait, but I might be mixing up different sources. Let me verify.

Actually, according to some references, the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields are those with \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37,\) and \( 73\). So 13 is included here. Wait, but I need to check if this is accurate.

Alternatively, I can check specific literature. For example, in the case of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), the ring of integers is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\), which is the same as our ring. Now, according to some sources, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is norm-Euclidean. Let me recall that the norm in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is given by \(N(a + b\sqrt{d}) = a^2 - db^2\). But in our case, since the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) where \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the norm would be \(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;)\), where \(\theta&#x27;\) is the conjugate of \(\theta\). Since \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the conjugate is \(\theta&#x27; = \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}\). So expanding the norm:

\(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;) = a^2 + ab(\theta + \theta&#x27;) + b^2 \theta \theta&#x27;\).

We know from the minimal polynomial that \(\theta + \theta&#x27; = 1\) (since the coefficient of \(x\) in \(x^2 - x - 3\) is -1, so sum of roots is 1) and \(\theta \theta&#x27; = -3\) (the constant term). Therefore:

\(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab(1) + b^2(-3) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\).

So the norm here is \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). For the ring to be Euclidean, given any elements \(a\) and \(b\) in the ring (\(b \neq 0\)), there should exist \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\).

So to prove it&#x27;s Euclidean, we need to show that for any \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exists \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\).

Alternatively, this can sometimes be approached by showing that for any element \(\alpha / \beta\) in \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists an element \(\gamma\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\alpha/\beta - \gamma) &lt; 1\). This is equivalent to the ring being Euclidean, as the norm is multiplicative.

So, let me think about this. For any element \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), we need to find \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

Since \(\xi\) can be written as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\), we need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) by integers such that the norm of \((x - a) + (y - b)\theta\) is less than 1.

Let me write \(\xi = s + t\theta\), where \(s, t \in \mathbb{Q}\). Then, the norm of \(\xi - \gamma\) where \(\gamma = a + b\theta\) is:

\(N((s - a) + (t - b)\theta) = (s - a)^2 + (s - a)(t - b) - 3(t - b)^2\).

We need this to be less than 1.

To ensure this, we need to find integers \(a, b\) such that \(|s - a|\) and \(|t - b|\) are small enough such that the above expression is less than 1.

Alternatively, since \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is a lattice in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), the problem reduces to covering the plane with regions around each lattice point such that every point in the plane is within a distance less than 1 (in the norm) from some lattice point. If such a covering is possible, then the ring is Euclidean.

But visualizing this for the norm \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\) might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can use the geometry of numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I can check known results. If \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is known to be norm-Euclidean, then the answer is yes. Let me check my memory again. I recall that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed one of the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields. For example, according to the book &quot;Introductory Algebraic Number Theory&quot; by Alaca and Williams, the list of norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields includes those with discriminant 5, 8, 12, 13, 17, 21, 24, 28, 29, 33, 37, etc. So 13 is included. Therefore, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But to be thorough, let me attempt to outline why \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is Euclidean. Let&#x27;s consider the norm function \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). Suppose we have two elements \(\alpha, \beta \neq 0\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), and we want to divide \(\alpha\) by \(\beta\).

Compute \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Express \(\xi\) as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\). We need to find \(q = m + n\theta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Let \(x = m + \delta\) and \(y = n + \epsilon\), where \(m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(\delta, \epsilon \in (-1/2, 1/2]\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = (\delta + \epsilon \theta)^2 + (\delta + \epsilon \theta)(\epsilon) - 3\epsilon^2\).

Wait, maybe this approach isn&#x27;t straightforward. Let&#x27;s instead compute the norm directly:

\(N(\xi - q) = (x - m)^2 + (x - m)(y - n) - 3(y - n)^2\).

Let me set \(u = x - m\) and \(v = y - n\), so \(|u| \leq 1/2\) and \(|v| \leq 1/2\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

We need to show that this is less than 1 for some choice of \(m, n\) such that \(|u|, |v| \leq 1/2\).

Wait, but actually, \(u\) and \(v\) can be in the interval \((-1/2, 1/2]\), so we need to check the maximum possible value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) over that square.

But let me compute the maximum value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) for \(u, v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

To find the maximum, we can take partial derivatives. Let \(f(u, v) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

Compute \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = 2u + v\), and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = u - 6v\).

Setting the derivatives to zero:

1. \(2u + v = 0\)
2. \(u - 6v = 0\)

From the second equation: \(u = 6v\). Plugging into the first equation: \(2(6v) + v = 0 \implies 13v = 0 \implies v = 0\). Then \(u = 0\). So the critical point is at (0, 0), which is a minimum? Wait, check the second derivatives.

The Hessian matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; -6
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant is (2)(-6) - (1)(1) = -12 - 1 = -13 &lt; 0. So the critical point at (0,0) is a saddle point. Therefore, the maximum of \(f(u, v)\) on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) occurs on the boundary.

So let&#x27;s check the boundaries.

Case 1: \(u = 1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

Then, \(f(1/2, v) = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 + (1/2)v - 3v^2\).

This is a quadratic in v. The maximum occurs either at the vertex or endpoints.

Vertex at \(v = -b/(2a)\). Here, a = -3, b = 1/2.

So vertex at \(v = -(1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/6 = 1/12\). Within the interval [-1/2, 1/2].

Compute f(1/2, 1/12) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/12) - 3*(1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Convert to 48 denominators:

12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Compute endpoints:

At v = -1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3*(1/4) = 0 - 3/4 = -3/4.

At v = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum on this edge is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Case 2: \(u = -1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(-1/2, v) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 - (1/2)v - 3v^2.

Again, quadratic in v with a = -3, b = -1/2.

Vertex at v = -(-1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/(-6) = -1/12.

Compute f(-1/2, -1/12) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/12) - 3*(-1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Same as before, 12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

At endpoints:

v = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

v = 1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum here is 13/48.

Case 3: \(v = 1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, 1/2) = u^2 + u*(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = u^2 + u/2 - 3/4.

This is quadratic in u, opening upwards. The vertex is at u = -b/(2a) = -(1/2)/(2*1) = -1/4.

Compute f(-1/4, 1/2) = (-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

At endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = -1/4 as before.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum on this edge is -1/4, which is not higher than previous maxima.

Case 4: \(v = -1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, -1/2) = u^2 + u*(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = u^2 - u/2 - 3/4.

Quadratic in u, vertex at u = (1/2)/(2*1) = 1/4.

Compute f(1/4, -1/2) = (1/4)^2 - (1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

Endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = -3/4.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = (-1/2)^2 - (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum here is -1/4.

Case 5: Edges where u or v is fixed at 1/2 or -1/2, but we already covered all edges.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(N(\xi - q)\) over the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708, which is less than 1. Therefore, for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\). Hence, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is norm-Euclidean.

Wait, hold on. If the maximum of \(N(\xi - q)\) is 13/48 which is approximately 0.27, which is definitely less than 1. Therefore, this would imply that the norm is a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring is Euclidean.

But wait, this seems conflicting with my initial uncertainty, but according to the calculation, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain is less than 1, it is Euclidean. Therefore, the answer should be yes, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have two elements in the ring, say \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), and try to divide them. Let&#x27;s take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = 2\). Then, \(\xi = \theta / 2 = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4\). So we need to find \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Express \(\xi\) as \(0 + (1/4)\theta\). So \(x = 0\), \(y = 1/4\). We need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) with integers \(m\) and \(n\). The closest integers to \(x = 0\) is \(m = 0\), and to \(y = 1/4\) is \(n = 0\) or \(n = 1\). Let&#x27;s check both:

If \(n = 0\), then \(q = 0 + 0\theta = 0\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi\), and \(N(\xi) = (0)^2 + (0)(1/4) - 3*(1/4)^2 = -3/16\). The norm is negative, but in absolute value, 3/16, which is less than 1.

But wait, the norm can be negative here? The norm in a real quadratic field is \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\), which can indeed be negative. However, when we talk about the Euclidean function, we usually take the absolute value of the norm. So in this case, |N(\xi - q)| = 3/16 &lt; 1. So this works.

Alternatively, if we take \(n = 1\), then \(q = 0 + 1\theta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi - \theta = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4 - (1 + \sqrt{13})/2 = (-1 - \sqrt{13})/4\). Then, N(\xi - q) = [(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta] has norm:

Let me compute it:

(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta = -1/4 - (1/4)\theta. The norm is:

(-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(-1/4) - 3*(-1/4)^2 = 1/16 + 1/16 - 3/16 = (1 + 1 - 3)/16 = (-1)/16. Absolute value is 1/16, which is even smaller. So either way, the norm is less than 1. Therefore, in this case, we can write \(\theta = 2*0 + r\) where \(N(r) = 3/16 &lt; N(2) = 4\), but actually, in the division, since we are allowed to choose any q, even if the norm is negative, as long as the absolute value is less than N(b). Wait, but in the division algorithm, the remainder can have norm less than that of beta. However, in this case, the norm of beta is N(2) = 4. The remainder here has norm |N(r)| = 3/16, which is less than 4. But actually, in the standard division algorithm, we have \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\). However, in the case of negative norms, perhaps we need to take the absolute value? Wait, the norm here is actually the field norm, which can be positive or negative. But in the context of Euclidean domains, the Euclidean function is usually taken to be the absolute value of the norm.

Wait, but in the case of the Gaussian integers, the norm is always non-negative, so it&#x27;s clear. In real quadratic fields, the norm can be negative, but since we need the Euclidean function to map to non-negative integers, we take the absolute value. Therefore, the Euclidean function here is |N(a)|. Therefore, when we say \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\), it&#x27;s actually |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So even if r has a negative norm, as long as its absolute value is less than |N(b)|, it&#x27;s okay.

But in our calculation above, when we approximated \(\xi = \theta / 2\) by q = 0, we got |N(\(\xi - 0\))| = 3/16 &lt; |N(2)| = 4. Wait, but 3/16 is much less than 4. However, in the division algorithm, we need |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So in this case, 3/16 &lt; 4, so it&#x27;s fine. Therefore, the division works.

Another example: take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, dividing \(\theta\) by \(\theta\), we get \(\xi = 1\), which is already in the ring, so the remainder is 0.

Alternatively, take \(\alpha = 1 + \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi = (1 + \theta)/\theta = 1/\theta + 1\). Since \(\theta\) satisfies \(\theta^2 = \theta + 3\), so \(1/\theta = (\theta - 1)/3\). Therefore, \(\xi = (\theta - 1)/3 + 1 = (theta - 1 + 3)/3 = (theta + 2)/3. So approximate this by some q in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\). Let me compute the numerical values.

theta = (1 + sqrt(13))/2 ≈ (1 + 3.6055)/2 ≈ 4.6055/2 ≈ 2.30275.

So xi = (theta + 2)/3 ≈ (2.30275 + 2)/3 ≈ 4.30275/3 ≈ 1.43425.

So in terms of the basis {1, theta}, xi is approximately 1.43425. So express this as x + y theta, where x and y are rational numbers. Wait, but xi = (theta + 2)/3, which is (2)/3 + (1)/3 theta. So x = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 and y = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333. So we need to approximate x and y with integers m and n. The closest integers to x = 2/3 is m = 1 or 0. If we take m = 1, then n should be 0 or 1? Wait, y = 1/3. The closest integer to 1/3 is 0. So maybe take m = 1, n = 0. Then, q = 1 + 0*theta = 1. Then, the remainder is xi - q = (2/3 - 1) + (1/3 - 0) theta = (-1/3) + (1/3) theta. The norm of this is:

N(-1/3 + (1/3)theta) = (-1/3)^2 + (-1/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 1/9 - 1/9 - 3/9 = (-3)/9 = -1/3. Absolute value is 1/3, which is less than |N(beta)| = |N(theta)| = |1^2 + 1*1 - 3*1^2| = |1 + 1 - 3| = |-1| = 1. So 1/3 &lt; 1, which works. Therefore, the remainder has norm less than that of beta, so the division works.

Alternatively, if we choose m = 0 and n = 0, then q = 0. The remainder is xi - 0 = xi, whose norm is:

N(2/3 + (1/3)theta) = (2/3)^2 + (2/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 4/9 + 2/9 - 3/9 = (4 + 2 - 3)/9 = 3/9 = 1/3. Absolute value 1/3 &lt; 1. So either way, we get a remainder with smaller norm.

Therefore, these examples support the conclusion that the ring is Euclidean.

Additionally, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain was found to be 13/48 ≈ 0.27, which is less than 1, this implies that the ring is indeed norm-Euclidean.

Therefore, after this thorough check, I can conclude that \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain, we start by noting that this ring is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). The element \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\) is an algebraic integer with minimal polynomial \(x^2 - x - 3\), which confirms that \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is indeed the ring of integers.

A key property of Euclidean domains is the existence of a Euclidean function, typically the absolute value of the norm in quadratic fields. For the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), the norm of an element \(a + b\theta\) is given by \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). 

To verify the Euclidean property, we need to show that for any elements \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exist \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\). This is equivalent to showing that for any \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

By analyzing the norm function and checking the maximum value of \(N(\xi - \gamma)\) over the fundamental domain, we find that the maximum norm on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is \(\frac{13}{48}\), which is less than 1. This ensures that for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that the norm of the remainder is less than the norm of \(\beta\).

Examples and calculations confirm that the division algorithm holds, and the norm function serves as a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain. Hmm, let&#x27;s start by recalling some definitions. A Euclidean domain is an integral domain where we can perform the Euclidean algorithm, which basically means there&#x27;s a way to measure the &quot;size&quot; of elements (called a Euclidean function) such that for any two elements \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b \neq 0\)), there exist \(q\) and \(r\) where \(a = bq + r\) and either \(r = 0\) or the size of \(r\) is less than the size of \(b\).

First, let me make sure I understand the ring in question. The ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) consists of all numbers of the form \(a + b\left(\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers. Let me simplify that expression a bit. Let me denote \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\). So the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\).

I know that \(\theta\) is a root of a quadratic equation. Let me find its minimal polynomial. If \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\), then multiplying both sides by 2 gives \(2\theta = \sqrt{13} + 1\). Rearranging, \(\sqrt{13} = 2\theta - 1\). Squaring both sides, \(13 = (2\theta - 1)^2 = 4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1\). Then, moving everything to one side: \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1 - 13 = 0\), so \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta - 12 = 0\). Dividing both sides by 4: \(\theta^2 - \theta - 3 = 0\). So the minimal polynomial is \(x^2 - x - 3\). Therefore, \(\theta\) is an algebraic integer of degree 2, which means \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Wait, hold on. The ring of integers in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is typically \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{d}}{2}\right]\) when \(d \equiv 1 \mod 4\), and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]\) otherwise. Here, \(d = 13\), which is 1 mod 4, so the ring of integers should be \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). But in our case, the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\), which is the same as \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). So actually, this ring is the full ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Therefore, we are dealing with the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Now, I need to recall whether this ring is a Euclidean domain. I know that for quadratic fields, some rings of integers are Euclidean, and others are not. For example, \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) (Gaussian integers) and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]\) are Euclidean, but others like \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]\) are not even UFDs.

But since 13 is a positive square-free integer, we&#x27;re dealing with a real quadratic field. Now, the question is whether its ring of integers is Euclidean with respect to the norm. Sometimes real quadratic fields are Euclidean, sometimes not. I remember that for small discriminants, like 5, 8, 12, etc., some are Euclidean. But I need to check specifically for 13.

Wait, let me recall: The Minkowski bound for the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) can be used to check whether it is a PID. If the class number is 1, then it is a PID. Now, Euclidean domains are PIDs, but not all PIDs are Euclidean. So even if the class number is 1, it might not be Euclidean. But for some quadratic fields, it&#x27;s known whether they are Euclidean.

Looking up my memory, I think that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) has class number 1. Let me verify that. For real quadratic fields, the class number is more complicated, but I recall that 13 is a prime where the class number is 1. Wait, primes like 5, 13, 17... Hmm, I need to be careful. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\) has class number 1, but \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{10})\) does not. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall specific results. According to what I remember, the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed a PID, hence has class number 1. But is it Euclidean? Some references say that for real quadratic fields, Euclideanity is known for certain cases. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7})\), and some others are Euclidean with respect to the norm. However, for 13, I need to check.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: A real quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is norm-Euclidean if and only if \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, 73\). Wait, but I might be mixing up different sources. Let me verify.

Actually, according to some references, the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields are those with \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37,\) and \( 73\). So 13 is included here. Wait, but I need to check if this is accurate.

Alternatively, I can check specific literature. For example, in the case of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), the ring of integers is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\), which is the same as our ring. Now, according to some sources, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is norm-Euclidean. Let me recall that the norm in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is given by \(N(a + b\sqrt{d}) = a^2 - db^2\). But in our case, since the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) where \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the norm would be \(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;)\), where \(\theta&#x27;\) is the conjugate of \(\theta\). Since \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the conjugate is \(\theta&#x27; = \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}\). So expanding the norm:

\(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;) = a^2 + ab(\theta + \theta&#x27;) + b^2 \theta \theta&#x27;\).

We know from the minimal polynomial that \(\theta + \theta&#x27; = 1\) (since the coefficient of \(x\) in \(x^2 - x - 3\) is -1, so sum of roots is 1) and \(\theta \theta&#x27; = -3\) (the constant term). Therefore:

\(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab(1) + b^2(-3) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\).

So the norm here is \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). For the ring to be Euclidean, given any elements \(a\) and \(b\) in the ring (\(b \neq 0\)), there should exist \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\).

So to prove it&#x27;s Euclidean, we need to show that for any \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exists \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\).

Alternatively, this can sometimes be approached by showing that for any element \(\alpha / \beta\) in \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists an element \(\gamma\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\alpha/\beta - \gamma) &lt; 1\). This is equivalent to the ring being Euclidean, as the norm is multiplicative.

So, let me think about this. For any element \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), we need to find \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

Since \(\xi\) can be written as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\), we need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) by integers such that the norm of \((x - a) + (y - b)\theta\) is less than 1.

Let me write \(\xi = s + t\theta\), where \(s, t \in \mathbb{Q}\). Then, the norm of \(\xi - \gamma\) where \(\gamma = a + b\theta\) is:

\(N((s - a) + (t - b)\theta) = (s - a)^2 + (s - a)(t - b) - 3(t - b)^2\).

We need this to be less than 1.

To ensure this, we need to find integers \(a, b\) such that \(|s - a|\) and \(|t - b|\) are small enough such that the above expression is less than 1.

Alternatively, since \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is a lattice in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), the problem reduces to covering the plane with regions around each lattice point such that every point in the plane is within a distance less than 1 (in the norm) from some lattice point. If such a covering is possible, then the ring is Euclidean.

But visualizing this for the norm \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\) might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can use the geometry of numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I can check known results. If \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is known to be norm-Euclidean, then the answer is yes. Let me check my memory again. I recall that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed one of the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields. For example, according to the book &quot;Introductory Algebraic Number Theory&quot; by Alaca and Williams, the list of norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields includes those with discriminant 5, 8, 12, 13, 17, 21, 24, 28, 29, 33, 37, etc. So 13 is included. Therefore, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But to be thorough, let me attempt to outline why \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is Euclidean. Let&#x27;s consider the norm function \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). Suppose we have two elements \(\alpha, \beta \neq 0\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), and we want to divide \(\alpha\) by \(\beta\).

Compute \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Express \(\xi\) as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\). We need to find \(q = m + n\theta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Let \(x = m + \delta\) and \(y = n + \epsilon\), where \(m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(\delta, \epsilon \in (-1/2, 1/2]\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = (\delta + \epsilon \theta)^2 + (\delta + \epsilon \theta)(\epsilon) - 3\epsilon^2\).

Wait, maybe this approach isn&#x27;t straightforward. Let&#x27;s instead compute the norm directly:

\(N(\xi - q) = (x - m)^2 + (x - m)(y - n) - 3(y - n)^2\).

Let me set \(u = x - m\) and \(v = y - n\), so \(|u| \leq 1/2\) and \(|v| \leq 1/2\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

We need to show that this is less than 1 for some choice of \(m, n\) such that \(|u|, |v| \leq 1/2\).

Wait, but actually, \(u\) and \(v\) can be in the interval \((-1/2, 1/2]\), so we need to check the maximum possible value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) over that square.

But let me compute the maximum value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) for \(u, v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

To find the maximum, we can take partial derivatives. Let \(f(u, v) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

Compute \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = 2u + v\), and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = u - 6v\).

Setting the derivatives to zero:

1. \(2u + v = 0\)
2. \(u - 6v = 0\)

From the second equation: \(u = 6v\). Plugging into the first equation: \(2(6v) + v = 0 \implies 13v = 0 \implies v = 0\). Then \(u = 0\). So the critical point is at (0, 0), which is a minimum? Wait, check the second derivatives.

The Hessian matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; -6
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant is (2)(-6) - (1)(1) = -12 - 1 = -13 &lt; 0. So the critical point at (0,0) is a saddle point. Therefore, the maximum of \(f(u, v)\) on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) occurs on the boundary.

So let&#x27;s check the boundaries.

Case 1: \(u = 1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

Then, \(f(1/2, v) = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 + (1/2)v - 3v^2\).

This is a quadratic in v. The maximum occurs either at the vertex or endpoints.

Vertex at \(v = -b/(2a)\). Here, a = -3, b = 1/2.

So vertex at \(v = -(1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/6 = 1/12\). Within the interval [-1/2, 1/2].

Compute f(1/2, 1/12) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/12) - 3*(1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Convert to 48 denominators:

12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Compute endpoints:

At v = -1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3*(1/4) = 0 - 3/4 = -3/4.

At v = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum on this edge is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Case 2: \(u = -1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(-1/2, v) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 - (1/2)v - 3v^2.

Again, quadratic in v with a = -3, b = -1/2.

Vertex at v = -(-1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/(-6) = -1/12.

Compute f(-1/2, -1/12) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/12) - 3*(-1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Same as before, 12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

At endpoints:

v = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

v = 1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum here is 13/48.

Case 3: \(v = 1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, 1/2) = u^2 + u*(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = u^2 + u/2 - 3/4.

This is quadratic in u, opening upwards. The vertex is at u = -b/(2a) = -(1/2)/(2*1) = -1/4.

Compute f(-1/4, 1/2) = (-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

At endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = -1/4 as before.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum on this edge is -1/4, which is not higher than previous maxima.

Case 4: \(v = -1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, -1/2) = u^2 + u*(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = u^2 - u/2 - 3/4.

Quadratic in u, vertex at u = (1/2)/(2*1) = 1/4.

Compute f(1/4, -1/2) = (1/4)^2 - (1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

Endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = -3/4.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = (-1/2)^2 - (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum here is -1/4.

Case 5: Edges where u or v is fixed at 1/2 or -1/2, but we already covered all edges.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(N(\xi - q)\) over the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708, which is less than 1. Therefore, for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\). Hence, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is norm-Euclidean.

Wait, hold on. If the maximum of \(N(\xi - q)\) is 13/48 which is approximately 0.27, which is definitely less than 1. Therefore, this would imply that the norm is a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring is Euclidean.

But wait, this seems conflicting with my initial uncertainty, but according to the calculation, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain is less than 1, it is Euclidean. Therefore, the answer should be yes, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have two elements in the ring, say \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), and try to divide them. Let&#x27;s take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = 2\). Then, \(\xi = \theta / 2 = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4\). So we need to find \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Express \(\xi\) as \(0 + (1/4)\theta\). So \(x = 0\), \(y = 1/4\). We need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) with integers \(m\) and \(n\). The closest integers to \(x = 0\) is \(m = 0\), and to \(y = 1/4\) is \(n = 0\) or \(n = 1\). Let&#x27;s check both:

If \(n = 0\), then \(q = 0 + 0\theta = 0\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi\), and \(N(\xi) = (0)^2 + (0)(1/4) - 3*(1/4)^2 = -3/16\). The norm is negative, but in absolute value, 3/16, which is less than 1.

But wait, the norm can be negative here? The norm in a real quadratic field is \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\), which can indeed be negative. However, when we talk about the Euclidean function, we usually take the absolute value of the norm. So in this case, |N(\xi - q)| = 3/16 &lt; 1. So this works.

Alternatively, if we take \(n = 1\), then \(q = 0 + 1\theta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi - \theta = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4 - (1 + \sqrt{13})/2 = (-1 - \sqrt{13})/4\). Then, N(\xi - q) = [(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta] has norm:

Let me compute it:

(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta = -1/4 - (1/4)\theta. The norm is:

(-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(-1/4) - 3*(-1/4)^2 = 1/16 + 1/16 - 3/16 = (1 + 1 - 3)/16 = (-1)/16. Absolute value is 1/16, which is even smaller. So either way, the norm is less than 1. Therefore, in this case, we can write \(\theta = 2*0 + r\) where \(N(r) = 3/16 &lt; N(2) = 4\), but actually, in the division, since we are allowed to choose any q, even if the norm is negative, as long as the absolute value is less than N(b). Wait, but in the division algorithm, the remainder can have norm less than that of beta. However, in this case, the norm of beta is N(2) = 4. The remainder here has norm |N(r)| = 3/16, which is less than 4. But actually, in the standard division algorithm, we have \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\). However, in the case of negative norms, perhaps we need to take the absolute value? Wait, the norm here is actually the field norm, which can be positive or negative. But in the context of Euclidean domains, the Euclidean function is usually taken to be the absolute value of the norm.

Wait, but in the case of the Gaussian integers, the norm is always non-negative, so it&#x27;s clear. In real quadratic fields, the norm can be negative, but since we need the Euclidean function to map to non-negative integers, we take the absolute value. Therefore, the Euclidean function here is |N(a)|. Therefore, when we say \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\), it&#x27;s actually |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So even if r has a negative norm, as long as its absolute value is less than |N(b)|, it&#x27;s okay.

But in our calculation above, when we approximated \(\xi = \theta / 2\) by q = 0, we got |N(\(\xi - 0\))| = 3/16 &lt; |N(2)| = 4. Wait, but 3/16 is much less than 4. However, in the division algorithm, we need |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So in this case, 3/16 &lt; 4, so it&#x27;s fine. Therefore, the division works.

Another example: take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, dividing \(\theta\) by \(\theta\), we get \(\xi = 1\), which is already in the ring, so the remainder is 0.

Alternatively, take \(\alpha = 1 + \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi = (1 + \theta)/\theta = 1/\theta + 1\). Since \(\theta\) satisfies \(\theta^2 = \theta + 3\), so \(1/\theta = (\theta - 1)/3\). Therefore, \(\xi = (\theta - 1)/3 + 1 = (theta - 1 + 3)/3 = (theta + 2)/3. So approximate this by some q in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\). Let me compute the numerical values.

theta = (1 + sqrt(13))/2 ≈ (1 + 3.6055)/2 ≈ 4.6055/2 ≈ 2.30275.

So xi = (theta + 2)/3 ≈ (2.30275 + 2)/3 ≈ 4.30275/3 ≈ 1.43425.

So in terms of the basis {1, theta}, xi is approximately 1.43425. So express this as x + y theta, where x and y are rational numbers. Wait, but xi = (theta + 2)/3, which is (2)/3 + (1)/3 theta. So x = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 and y = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333. So we need to approximate x and y with integers m and n. The closest integers to x = 2/3 is m = 1 or 0. If we take m = 1, then n should be 0 or 1? Wait, y = 1/3. The closest integer to 1/3 is 0. So maybe take m = 1, n = 0. Then, q = 1 + 0*theta = 1. Then, the remainder is xi - q = (2/3 - 1) + (1/3 - 0) theta = (-1/3) + (1/3) theta. The norm of this is:

N(-1/3 + (1/3)theta) = (-1/3)^2 + (-1/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 1/9 - 1/9 - 3/9 = (-3)/9 = -1/3. Absolute value is 1/3, which is less than |N(beta)| = |N(theta)| = |1^2 + 1*1 - 3*1^2| = |1 + 1 - 3| = |-1| = 1. So 1/3 &lt; 1, which works. Therefore, the remainder has norm less than that of beta, so the division works.

Alternatively, if we choose m = 0 and n = 0, then q = 0. The remainder is xi - 0 = xi, whose norm is:

N(2/3 + (1/3)theta) = (2/3)^2 + (2/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 4/9 + 2/9 - 3/9 = (4 + 2 - 3)/9 = 3/9 = 1/3. Absolute value 1/3 &lt; 1. So either way, we get a remainder with smaller norm.

Therefore, these examples support the conclusion that the ring is Euclidean.

Additionally, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain was found to be 13/48 ≈ 0.27, which is less than 1, this implies that the ring is indeed norm-Euclidean.

Therefore, after this thorough check, I can conclude that \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain, we start by noting that this ring is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). The element \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\) is an algebraic integer with minimal polynomial \(x^2 - x - 3\), which confirms that \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is indeed the ring of integers.

A key property of Euclidean domains is the existence of a Euclidean function, typically the absolute value of the norm in quadratic fields. For the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), the norm of an element \(a + b\theta\) is given by \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). 

To verify the Euclidean property, we need to show that for any elements \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exist \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\). This is equivalent to showing that for any \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

By analyzing the norm function and checking the maximum value of \(N(\xi - \gamma)\) over the fundamental domain, we find that the maximum norm on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is \(\frac{13}{48}\), which is less than 1. This ensures that for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that the norm of the remainder is less than the norm of \(\beta\).

Examples and calculations confirm that the division algorithm holds, and the norm function serves as a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain. Hmm, let&#x27;s start by recalling some definitions. A Euclidean domain is an integral domain where we can perform the Euclidean algorithm, which basically means there&#x27;s a way to measure the &quot;size&quot; of elements (called a Euclidean function) such that for any two elements \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b \neq 0\)), there exist \(q\) and \(r\) where \(a = bq + r\) and either \(r = 0\) or the size of \(r\) is less than the size of \(b\).

First, let me make sure I understand the ring in question. The ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) consists of all numbers of the form \(a + b\left(\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers. Let me simplify that expression a bit. Let me denote \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\). So the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\).

I know that \(\theta\) is a root of a quadratic equation. Let me find its minimal polynomial. If \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\), then multiplying both sides by 2 gives \(2\theta = \sqrt{13} + 1\). Rearranging, \(\sqrt{13} = 2\theta - 1\). Squaring both sides, \(13 = (2\theta - 1)^2 = 4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1\). Then, moving everything to one side: \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1 - 13 = 0\), so \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta - 12 = 0\). Dividing both sides by 4: \(\theta^2 - \theta - 3 = 0\). So the minimal polynomial is \(x^2 - x - 3\). Therefore, \(\theta\) is an algebraic integer of degree 2, which means \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Wait, hold on. The ring of integers in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is typically \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{d}}{2}\right]\) when \(d \equiv 1 \mod 4\), and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]\) otherwise. Here, \(d = 13\), which is 1 mod 4, so the ring of integers should be \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). But in our case, the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\), which is the same as \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). So actually, this ring is the full ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Therefore, we are dealing with the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Now, I need to recall whether this ring is a Euclidean domain. I know that for quadratic fields, some rings of integers are Euclidean, and others are not. For example, \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) (Gaussian integers) and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]\) are Euclidean, but others like \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]\) are not even UFDs.

But since 13 is a positive square-free integer, we&#x27;re dealing with a real quadratic field. Now, the question is whether its ring of integers is Euclidean with respect to the norm. Sometimes real quadratic fields are Euclidean, sometimes not. I remember that for small discriminants, like 5, 8, 12, etc., some are Euclidean. But I need to check specifically for 13.

Wait, let me recall: The Minkowski bound for the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) can be used to check whether it is a PID. If the class number is 1, then it is a PID. Now, Euclidean domains are PIDs, but not all PIDs are Euclidean. So even if the class number is 1, it might not be Euclidean. But for some quadratic fields, it&#x27;s known whether they are Euclidean.

Looking up my memory, I think that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) has class number 1. Let me verify that. For real quadratic fields, the class number is more complicated, but I recall that 13 is a prime where the class number is 1. Wait, primes like 5, 13, 17... Hmm, I need to be careful. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\) has class number 1, but \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{10})\) does not. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall specific results. According to what I remember, the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed a PID, hence has class number 1. But is it Euclidean? Some references say that for real quadratic fields, Euclideanity is known for certain cases. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7})\), and some others are Euclidean with respect to the norm. However, for 13, I need to check.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: A real quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is norm-Euclidean if and only if \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, 73\). Wait, but I might be mixing up different sources. Let me verify.

Actually, according to some references, the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields are those with \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37,\) and \( 73\). So 13 is included here. Wait, but I need to check if this is accurate.

Alternatively, I can check specific literature. For example, in the case of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), the ring of integers is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\), which is the same as our ring. Now, according to some sources, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is norm-Euclidean. Let me recall that the norm in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is given by \(N(a + b\sqrt{d}) = a^2 - db^2\). But in our case, since the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) where \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the norm would be \(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;)\), where \(\theta&#x27;\) is the conjugate of \(\theta\). Since \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the conjugate is \(\theta&#x27; = \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}\). So expanding the norm:

\(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;) = a^2 + ab(\theta + \theta&#x27;) + b^2 \theta \theta&#x27;\).

We know from the minimal polynomial that \(\theta + \theta&#x27; = 1\) (since the coefficient of \(x\) in \(x^2 - x - 3\) is -1, so sum of roots is 1) and \(\theta \theta&#x27; = -3\) (the constant term). Therefore:

\(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab(1) + b^2(-3) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\).

So the norm here is \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). For the ring to be Euclidean, given any elements \(a\) and \(b\) in the ring (\(b \neq 0\)), there should exist \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\).

So to prove it&#x27;s Euclidean, we need to show that for any \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exists \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\).

Alternatively, this can sometimes be approached by showing that for any element \(\alpha / \beta\) in \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists an element \(\gamma\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\alpha/\beta - \gamma) &lt; 1\). This is equivalent to the ring being Euclidean, as the norm is multiplicative.

So, let me think about this. For any element \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), we need to find \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

Since \(\xi\) can be written as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\), we need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) by integers such that the norm of \((x - a) + (y - b)\theta\) is less than 1.

Let me write \(\xi = s + t\theta\), where \(s, t \in \mathbb{Q}\). Then, the norm of \(\xi - \gamma\) where \(\gamma = a + b\theta\) is:

\(N((s - a) + (t - b)\theta) = (s - a)^2 + (s - a)(t - b) - 3(t - b)^2\).

We need this to be less than 1.

To ensure this, we need to find integers \(a, b\) such that \(|s - a|\) and \(|t - b|\) are small enough such that the above expression is less than 1.

Alternatively, since \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is a lattice in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), the problem reduces to covering the plane with regions around each lattice point such that every point in the plane is within a distance less than 1 (in the norm) from some lattice point. If such a covering is possible, then the ring is Euclidean.

But visualizing this for the norm \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\) might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can use the geometry of numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I can check known results. If \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is known to be norm-Euclidean, then the answer is yes. Let me check my memory again. I recall that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed one of the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields. For example, according to the book &quot;Introductory Algebraic Number Theory&quot; by Alaca and Williams, the list of norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields includes those with discriminant 5, 8, 12, 13, 17, 21, 24, 28, 29, 33, 37, etc. So 13 is included. Therefore, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But to be thorough, let me attempt to outline why \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is Euclidean. Let&#x27;s consider the norm function \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). Suppose we have two elements \(\alpha, \beta \neq 0\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), and we want to divide \(\alpha\) by \(\beta\).

Compute \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Express \(\xi\) as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\). We need to find \(q = m + n\theta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Let \(x = m + \delta\) and \(y = n + \epsilon\), where \(m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(\delta, \epsilon \in (-1/2, 1/2]\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = (\delta + \epsilon \theta)^2 + (\delta + \epsilon \theta)(\epsilon) - 3\epsilon^2\).

Wait, maybe this approach isn&#x27;t straightforward. Let&#x27;s instead compute the norm directly:

\(N(\xi - q) = (x - m)^2 + (x - m)(y - n) - 3(y - n)^2\).

Let me set \(u = x - m\) and \(v = y - n\), so \(|u| \leq 1/2\) and \(|v| \leq 1/2\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

We need to show that this is less than 1 for some choice of \(m, n\) such that \(|u|, |v| \leq 1/2\).

Wait, but actually, \(u\) and \(v\) can be in the interval \((-1/2, 1/2]\), so we need to check the maximum possible value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) over that square.

But let me compute the maximum value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) for \(u, v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

To find the maximum, we can take partial derivatives. Let \(f(u, v) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

Compute \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = 2u + v\), and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = u - 6v\).

Setting the derivatives to zero:

1. \(2u + v = 0\)
2. \(u - 6v = 0\)

From the second equation: \(u = 6v\). Plugging into the first equation: \(2(6v) + v = 0 \implies 13v = 0 \implies v = 0\). Then \(u = 0\). So the critical point is at (0, 0), which is a minimum? Wait, check the second derivatives.

The Hessian matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; -6
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant is (2)(-6) - (1)(1) = -12 - 1 = -13 &lt; 0. So the critical point at (0,0) is a saddle point. Therefore, the maximum of \(f(u, v)\) on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) occurs on the boundary.

So let&#x27;s check the boundaries.

Case 1: \(u = 1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

Then, \(f(1/2, v) = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 + (1/2)v - 3v^2\).

This is a quadratic in v. The maximum occurs either at the vertex or endpoints.

Vertex at \(v = -b/(2a)\). Here, a = -3, b = 1/2.

So vertex at \(v = -(1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/6 = 1/12\). Within the interval [-1/2, 1/2].

Compute f(1/2, 1/12) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/12) - 3*(1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Convert to 48 denominators:

12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Compute endpoints:

At v = -1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3*(1/4) = 0 - 3/4 = -3/4.

At v = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum on this edge is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Case 2: \(u = -1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(-1/2, v) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 - (1/2)v - 3v^2.

Again, quadratic in v with a = -3, b = -1/2.

Vertex at v = -(-1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/(-6) = -1/12.

Compute f(-1/2, -1/12) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/12) - 3*(-1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Same as before, 12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

At endpoints:

v = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

v = 1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum here is 13/48.

Case 3: \(v = 1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, 1/2) = u^2 + u*(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = u^2 + u/2 - 3/4.

This is quadratic in u, opening upwards. The vertex is at u = -b/(2a) = -(1/2)/(2*1) = -1/4.

Compute f(-1/4, 1/2) = (-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

At endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = -1/4 as before.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum on this edge is -1/4, which is not higher than previous maxima.

Case 4: \(v = -1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, -1/2) = u^2 + u*(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = u^2 - u/2 - 3/4.

Quadratic in u, vertex at u = (1/2)/(2*1) = 1/4.

Compute f(1/4, -1/2) = (1/4)^2 - (1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

u = 1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = -3/4.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = (-1/2)^2 - (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum here is -1/4.

Case 5: Edges where u or v is fixed at 1/2 or -1/2, but we already covered all edges.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(N(\xi - q)\) over the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708, which is less than 1. Therefore, for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\). Hence, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is norm-Euclidean.

Wait, hold on. If the maximum of \(N(\xi - q)\) is 13/48 which is approximately 0.27, which is definitely less than 1. Therefore, this would imply that the norm is a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring is Euclidean.

But wait, this seems conflicting with my initial uncertainty, but according to the calculation, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain is less than 1, it is Euclidean. Therefore, the answer should be yes, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have two elements in the ring, say \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), and try to divide them. Let&#x27;s take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = 2\). Then, \(\xi = \theta / 2 = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4\). So we need to find \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Express \(\xi\) as \(0 + (1/4)\theta\). So \(x = 0\), \(y = 1/4\). We need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) with integers \(m\) and \(n\). The closest integers to \(x = 0\) is \(m = 0\), and to \(y = 1/4\) is \(n = 0\) or \(n = 1\). Let&#x27;s check both:

If \(n = 0\), then \(q = 0 + 0\theta = 0\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi\), and \(N(\xi) = (0)^2 + (0)(1/4) - 3*(1/4)^2 = -3/16\). The norm is negative, but in absolute value, 3/16, which is less than 1.

But wait, the norm can be negative here? The norm in a real quadratic field is \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\), which can indeed be negative. However, when we talk about the Euclidean function, we usually take the absolute value of the norm. So in this case, |N(\xi - q)| = 3/16 &lt; 1. So this works.

Alternatively, if we take \(n = 1\), then \(q = 0 + 1\theta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi - \theta = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4 - (1 + \sqrt{13})/2 = (-1 - \sqrt{13})/4\). Then, N(\xi - q) = [(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta] has norm:

Let me compute it:

(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta = -1/4 - (1/4)\theta. The norm is:

(-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(-1/4) - 3*(-1/4)^2 = 1/16 + 1/16 - 3/16 = (1 + 1 - 3)/16 = (-1)/16. Absolute value is 1/16, which is even smaller. So either way, the norm is less than 1. Therefore, in this case, we can write \(\theta = 2*0 + r\) where \(N(r) = 3/16 &lt; N(2) = 4\), but actually, in the division, since we are allowed to choose any q, even if the norm is negative, as long as the absolute value is less than N(b). Wait, but in the division algorithm, the remainder can have norm less than that of beta. However, in this case, the norm of beta is N(2) = 4. The remainder here has norm |N(r)| = 3/16, which is less than 4. But actually, in the standard division algorithm, we have \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\). However, in the case of negative norms, perhaps we need to take the absolute value? Wait, the norm here is actually the field norm, which can be positive or negative. But in the context of Euclidean domains, the Euclidean function is usually taken to be the absolute value of the norm.

Wait, but in the case of the Gaussian integers, the norm is always non-negative, so it&#x27;s clear. In real quadratic fields, the norm can be negative, but since we need the Euclidean function to map to non-negative integers, we take the absolute value. Therefore, the Euclidean function here is |N(a)|. Therefore, when we say \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\), it&#x27;s actually |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So even if r has a negative norm, as long as its absolute value is less than |N(b)|, it&#x27;s okay.

But in our calculation above, when we approximated \(\xi = \theta / 2\) by q = 0, we got |N(\(\xi - 0\))| = 3/16 &lt; |N(2)| = 4. Wait, but 3/16 is much less than 4. However, in the division algorithm, we need |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So in this case, 3/16 &lt; 4, so it&#x27;s fine. Therefore, the division works.

Another example: take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, dividing \(\theta\) by \(\theta\), we get \(\xi = 1\), which is already in the ring, so the remainder is 0.

Alternatively, take \(\alpha = 1 + \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi = (1 + \theta)/\theta = 1/\theta + 1\). Since \(\theta\) satisfies \(\theta^2 = \theta + 3\), so \(1/\theta = (\theta - 1)/3\). Therefore, \(\xi = (\theta - 1)/3 + 1 = (theta - 1 + 3)/3 = (theta + 2)/3. So approximate this by some q in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\). Let me compute the numerical values.

theta = (1 + sqrt(13))/2 ≈ (1 + 3.6055)/2 ≈ 4.6055/2 ≈ 2.30275.

So xi = (theta + 2)/3 ≈ (2.30275 + 2)/3 ≈ 4.30275/3 ≈ 1.43425.

So in terms of the basis {1, theta}, xi is approximately 1.43425. So express this as x + y theta, where x and y are rational numbers. Wait, but xi = (theta + 2)/3, which is (2)/3 + (1)/3 theta. So x = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 and y = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333. So we need to approximate x and y with integers m and n. The closest integers to x = 2/3 is m = 1 or 0. If we take m = 1, then n should be 0 or 1? Wait, y = 1/3. The closest integer to 1/3 is 0. So maybe take m = 1, n = 0. Then, q = 1 + 0*theta = 1. Then, the remainder is xi - q = (2/3 - 1) + (1/3 - 0) theta = (-1/3) + (1/3) theta. The norm of this is:

N(-1/3 + (1/3)theta) = (-1/3)^2 + (-1/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 1/9 - 1/9 - 3/9 = (-3)/9 = -1/3. Absolute value is 1/3, which is less than |N(beta)| = |N(theta)| = |1^2 + 1*1 - 3*1^2| = |1 + 1 - 3| = |-1| = 1. So 1/3 &lt; 1, which works. Therefore, the remainder has norm less than that of beta, so the division works.

Alternatively, if we choose m = 0 and n = 0, then q = 0. The remainder is xi - 0 = xi, whose norm is:

N(2/3 + (1/3)theta) = (2/3)^2 + (2/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 4/9 + 2/9 - 3/9 = (4 + 2 - 3)/9 = 3/9 = 1/3. Absolute value 1/3 &lt; 1. So either way, we get a remainder with smaller norm.

Therefore, these examples support the conclusion that the ring is Euclidean.

Additionally, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain was found to be 13/48 ≈ 0.27, which is less than 1, this implies that the ring is indeed norm-Euclidean.

Therefore, after this thorough check, I can conclude that \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain, we start by noting that this ring is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). The element \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\) is an algebraic integer with minimal polynomial \(x^2 - x - 3\), which confirms that \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is indeed the ring of integers.

A key property of Euclidean domains is the existence of a Euclidean function, typically the absolute value of the norm in quadratic fields. For the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), the norm of an element \(a + b\theta\) is given by \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). 

To verify the Euclidean property, we need to show that for any elements \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exist \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\). This is equivalent to showing that for any \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

By analyzing the norm function and checking the maximum value of \(N(\xi - \gamma)\) over the fundamental domain, we find that the maximum norm on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is \(\frac{13}{48}\), which is less than 1. This ensures that for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that the norm of the remainder is less than the norm of \(\beta\).

Examples and calculations confirm that the division algorithm holds, and the norm function serves as a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain. Hmm, let&#x27;s start by recalling some definitions. A Euclidean domain is an integral domain where we can perform the Euclidean algorithm, which basically means there&#x27;s a way to measure the &quot;size&quot; of elements (called a Euclidean function) such that for any two elements \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b \neq 0\)), there exist \(q\) and \(r\) where \(a = bq + r\) and either \(r = 0\) or the size of \(r\) is less than the size of \(b\).

First, let me make sure I understand the ring in question. The ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) consists of all numbers of the form \(a + b\left(\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers. Let me simplify that expression a bit. Let me denote \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\). So the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\).

I know that \(\theta\) is a root of a quadratic equation. Let me find its minimal polynomial. If \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\), then multiplying both sides by 2 gives \(2\theta = \sqrt{13} + 1\). Rearranging, \(\sqrt{13} = 2\theta - 1\). Squaring both sides, \(13 = (2\theta - 1)^2 = 4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1\). Then, moving everything to one side: \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta + 1 - 13 = 0\), so \(4\theta^2 - 4\theta - 12 = 0\). Dividing both sides by 4: \(\theta^2 - \theta - 3 = 0\). So the minimal polynomial is \(x^2 - x - 3\). Therefore, \(\theta\) is an algebraic integer of degree 2, which means \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Wait, hold on. The ring of integers in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is typically \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{d}}{2}\right]\) when \(d \equiv 1 \mod 4\), and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]\) otherwise. Here, \(d = 13\), which is 1 mod 4, so the ring of integers should be \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). But in our case, the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\), which is the same as \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\). So actually, this ring is the full ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\).

Therefore, we are dealing with the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Now, I need to recall whether this ring is a Euclidean domain. I know that for quadratic fields, some rings of integers are Euclidean, and others are not. For example, \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) (Gaussian integers) and \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]\) are Euclidean, but others like \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]\) are not even UFDs.

But since 13 is a positive square-free integer, we&#x27;re dealing with a real quadratic field. Now, the question is whether its ring of integers is Euclidean with respect to the norm. Sometimes real quadratic fields are Euclidean, sometimes not. I remember that for small discriminants, like 5, 8, 12, etc., some are Euclidean. But I need to check specifically for 13.

Wait, let me recall: The Minkowski bound for the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) can be used to check whether it is a PID. If the class number is 1, then it is a PID. Now, Euclidean domains are PIDs, but not all PIDs are Euclidean. So even if the class number is 1, it might not be Euclidean. But for some quadratic fields, it&#x27;s known whether they are Euclidean.

Looking up my memory, I think that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) has class number 1. Let me verify that. For real quadratic fields, the class number is more complicated, but I recall that 13 is a prime where the class number is 1. Wait, primes like 5, 13, 17... Hmm, I need to be careful. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\) has class number 1, but \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{10})\) does not. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall specific results. According to what I remember, the ring of integers of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed a PID, hence has class number 1. But is it Euclidean? Some references say that for real quadratic fields, Euclideanity is known for certain cases. For example, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})\), \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7})\), and some others are Euclidean with respect to the norm. However, for 13, I need to check.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: A real quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is norm-Euclidean if and only if \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, 73\). Wait, but I might be mixing up different sources. Let me verify.

Actually, according to some references, the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields are those with \(d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37,\) and \( 73\). So 13 is included here. Wait, but I need to check if this is accurate.

Alternatively, I can check specific literature. For example, in the case of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), the ring of integers is \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\right]\), which is the same as our ring. Now, according to some sources, \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is norm-Euclidean. Let me recall that the norm in a quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) is given by \(N(a + b\sqrt{d}) = a^2 - db^2\). But in our case, since the ring is \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) where \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the norm would be \(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;)\), where \(\theta&#x27;\) is the conjugate of \(\theta\). Since \(\theta = \frac{1+\sqrt{13}}{2}\), the conjugate is \(\theta&#x27; = \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}\). So expanding the norm:

\(N(a + b\theta) = (a + b\theta)(a + b\theta&#x27;) = a^2 + ab(\theta + \theta&#x27;) + b^2 \theta \theta&#x27;\).

We know from the minimal polynomial that \(\theta + \theta&#x27; = 1\) (since the coefficient of \(x\) in \(x^2 - x - 3\) is -1, so sum of roots is 1) and \(\theta \theta&#x27; = -3\) (the constant term). Therefore:

\(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab(1) + b^2(-3) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\).

So the norm here is \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). For the ring to be Euclidean, given any elements \(a\) and \(b\) in the ring (\(b \neq 0\)), there should exist \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\).

So to prove it&#x27;s Euclidean, we need to show that for any \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exists \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\).

Alternatively, this can sometimes be approached by showing that for any element \(\alpha / \beta\) in \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists an element \(\gamma\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\alpha/\beta - \gamma) &lt; 1\). This is equivalent to the ring being Euclidean, as the norm is multiplicative.

So, let me think about this. For any element \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), we need to find \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

Since \(\xi\) can be written as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\), we need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) by integers such that the norm of \((x - a) + (y - b)\theta\) is less than 1.

Let me write \(\xi = s + t\theta\), where \(s, t \in \mathbb{Q}\). Then, the norm of \(\xi - \gamma\) where \(\gamma = a + b\theta\) is:

\(N((s - a) + (t - b)\theta) = (s - a)^2 + (s - a)(t - b) - 3(t - b)^2\).

We need this to be less than 1.

To ensure this, we need to find integers \(a, b\) such that \(|s - a|\) and \(|t - b|\) are small enough such that the above expression is less than 1.

Alternatively, since \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is a lattice in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), the problem reduces to covering the plane with regions around each lattice point such that every point in the plane is within a distance less than 1 (in the norm) from some lattice point. If such a covering is possible, then the ring is Euclidean.

But visualizing this for the norm \(a^2 + ab - 3b^2\) might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can use the geometry of numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I can check known results. If \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is known to be norm-Euclidean, then the answer is yes. Let me check my memory again. I recall that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is indeed one of the norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields. For example, according to the book &quot;Introductory Algebraic Number Theory&quot; by Alaca and Williams, the list of norm-Euclidean real quadratic fields includes those with discriminant 5, 8, 12, 13, 17, 21, 24, 28, 29, 33, 37, etc. So 13 is included. Therefore, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But to be thorough, let me attempt to outline why \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\) is Euclidean. Let&#x27;s consider the norm function \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). Suppose we have two elements \(\alpha, \beta \neq 0\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), and we want to divide \(\alpha\) by \(\beta\).

Compute \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). Express \(\xi\) as \(x + y\theta\) with \(x, y \in \mathbb{Q}\). We need to find \(q = m + n\theta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Let \(x = m + \delta\) and \(y = n + \epsilon\), where \(m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(\delta, \epsilon \in (-1/2, 1/2]\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = (\delta + \epsilon \theta)^2 + (\delta + \epsilon \theta)(\epsilon) - 3\epsilon^2\).

Wait, maybe this approach isn&#x27;t straightforward. Let&#x27;s instead compute the norm directly:

\(N(\xi - q) = (x - m)^2 + (x - m)(y - n) - 3(y - n)^2\).

Let me set \(u = x - m\) and \(v = y - n\), so \(|u| \leq 1/2\) and \(|v| \leq 1/2\). Then,

\(N(\xi - q) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

We need to show that this is less than 1 for some choice of \(m, n\) such that \(|u|, |v| \leq 1/2\).

Wait, but actually, \(u\) and \(v\) can be in the interval \((-1/2, 1/2]\), so we need to check the maximum possible value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) over that square.

But let me compute the maximum value of \(u^2 + uv - 3v^2\) for \(u, v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

To find the maximum, we can take partial derivatives. Let \(f(u, v) = u^2 + uv - 3v^2\).

Compute \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial u} = 2u + v\), and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = u - 6v\).

Setting the derivatives to zero:

1. \(2u + v = 0\)
2. \(u - 6v = 0\)

From the second equation: \(u = 6v\). Plugging into the first equation: \(2(6v) + v = 0 \implies 13v = 0 \implies v = 0\). Then \(u = 0\). So the critical point is at (0, 0), which is a minimum? Wait, check the second derivatives.

The Hessian matrix is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; -6
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant is (2)(-6) - (1)(1) = -12 - 1 = -13 &lt; 0. So the critical point at (0,0) is a saddle point. Therefore, the maximum of \(f(u, v)\) on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) occurs on the boundary.

So let&#x27;s check the boundaries.

Case 1: \(u = 1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

Then, \(f(1/2, v) = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 + (1/2)v - 3v^2\).

This is a quadratic in v. The maximum occurs either at the vertex or endpoints.

Vertex at \(v = -b/(2a)\). Here, a = -3, b = 1/2.

So vertex at \(v = -(1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/6 = 1/12\). Within the interval [-1/2, 1/2].

Compute f(1/2, 1/12) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/12) - 3*(1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Convert to 48 denominators:

12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Compute endpoints:

At v = -1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3*(1/4) = 0 - 3/4 = -3/4.

At v = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 + (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = (1/4 + 1/4) - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum on this edge is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

Case 2: \(u = -1/2\), \(v \in [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(-1/2, v) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)v - 3v^2 = 1/4 - (1/2)v - 3v^2.

Again, quadratic in v with a = -3, b = -1/2.

Vertex at v = -(-1/2)/(2*(-3)) = (1/2)/(-6) = -1/12.

Compute f(-1/2, -1/12) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/12) - 3*(-1/12)^2 = 1/4 + 1/24 - 3*(1/144) = 1/4 + 1/24 - 1/48 = Same as before, 12/48 + 2/48 - 1/48 = 13/48 ≈ 0.2708.

At endpoints:

v = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = 1/2 - 3/4 = -1/4.

v = 1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = 1/4 - (1/2)(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum here is 13/48.

Case 3: \(v = 1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, 1/2) = u^2 + u*(1/2) - 3*(1/2)^2 = u^2 + u/2 - 3/4.

This is quadratic in u, opening upwards. The vertex is at u = -b/(2a) = -(1/2)/(2*1) = -1/4.

Compute f(-1/4, 1/2) = (-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

At endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, 1/2) = -1/4 as before.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, 1/2) = (-1/2)^2 + (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 - 1/4 - 3/4 = -3/4.

So maximum on this edge is -1/4, which is not higher than previous maxima.

Case 4: \(v = -1/2\), \(u ∈ [-1/2, 1/2]\).

f(u, -1/2) = u^2 + u*(-1/2) - 3*(-1/2)^2 = u^2 - u/2 - 3/4.

Quadratic in u, vertex at u = (1/2)/(2*1) = 1/4.

Compute f(1/4, -1/2) = (1/4)^2 - (1/4)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/16 - 1/8 - 3/4 = 1/16 - 2/16 - 12/16 = (-13/16) ≈ -0.8125.

Endpoints:

u = 1/2: f(1/2, -1/2) = -3/4.

u = -1/2: f(-1/2, -1/2) = (-1/2)^2 - (-1/2)(1/2) - 3/4 = 1/4 + 1/4 - 3/4 = -1/4.

So maximum here is -1/4.

Case 5: Edges where u or v is fixed at 1/2 or -1/2, but we already covered all edges.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(N(\xi - q)\) over the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is 13/48 ≈ 0.2708, which is less than 1. Therefore, for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\). Hence, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is norm-Euclidean.

Wait, hold on. If the maximum of \(N(\xi - q)\) is 13/48 which is approximately 0.27, which is definitely less than 1. Therefore, this would imply that the norm is a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring is Euclidean.

But wait, this seems conflicting with my initial uncertainty, but according to the calculation, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain is less than 1, it is Euclidean. Therefore, the answer should be yes, \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

But let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have two elements in the ring, say \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), and try to divide them. Let&#x27;s take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = 2\). Then, \(\xi = \theta / 2 = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4\). So we need to find \(q \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - q) &lt; 1\).

Express \(\xi\) as \(0 + (1/4)\theta\). So \(x = 0\), \(y = 1/4\). We need to approximate \(x\) and \(y\) with integers \(m\) and \(n\). The closest integers to \(x = 0\) is \(m = 0\), and to \(y = 1/4\) is \(n = 0\) or \(n = 1\). Let&#x27;s check both:

If \(n = 0\), then \(q = 0 + 0\theta = 0\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi\), and \(N(\xi) = (0)^2 + (0)(1/4) - 3*(1/4)^2 = -3/16\). The norm is negative, but in absolute value, 3/16, which is less than 1.

But wait, the norm can be negative here? The norm in a real quadratic field is \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\), which can indeed be negative. However, when we talk about the Euclidean function, we usually take the absolute value of the norm. So in this case, |N(\xi - q)| = 3/16 &lt; 1. So this works.

Alternatively, if we take \(n = 1\), then \(q = 0 + 1\theta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi - q = \xi - \theta = (1 + \sqrt{13})/4 - (1 + \sqrt{13})/2 = (-1 - \sqrt{13})/4\). Then, N(\xi - q) = [(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta] has norm:

Let me compute it:

(-1/4) + (-1/4)\theta = -1/4 - (1/4)\theta. The norm is:

(-1/4)^2 + (-1/4)(-1/4) - 3*(-1/4)^2 = 1/16 + 1/16 - 3/16 = (1 + 1 - 3)/16 = (-1)/16. Absolute value is 1/16, which is even smaller. So either way, the norm is less than 1. Therefore, in this case, we can write \(\theta = 2*0 + r\) where \(N(r) = 3/16 &lt; N(2) = 4\), but actually, in the division, since we are allowed to choose any q, even if the norm is negative, as long as the absolute value is less than N(b). Wait, but in the division algorithm, the remainder can have norm less than that of beta. However, in this case, the norm of beta is N(2) = 4. The remainder here has norm |N(r)| = 3/16, which is less than 4. But actually, in the standard division algorithm, we have \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\). However, in the case of negative norms, perhaps we need to take the absolute value? Wait, the norm here is actually the field norm, which can be positive or negative. But in the context of Euclidean domains, the Euclidean function is usually taken to be the absolute value of the norm.

Wait, but in the case of the Gaussian integers, the norm is always non-negative, so it&#x27;s clear. In real quadratic fields, the norm can be negative, but since we need the Euclidean function to map to non-negative integers, we take the absolute value. Therefore, the Euclidean function here is |N(a)|. Therefore, when we say \(N(r) &lt; N(b)\), it&#x27;s actually |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So even if r has a negative norm, as long as its absolute value is less than |N(b)|, it&#x27;s okay.

But in our calculation above, when we approximated \(\xi = \theta / 2\) by q = 0, we got |N(\(\xi - 0\))| = 3/16 &lt; |N(2)| = 4. Wait, but 3/16 is much less than 4. However, in the division algorithm, we need |N(r)| &lt; |N(b)|. So in this case, 3/16 &lt; 4, so it&#x27;s fine. Therefore, the division works.

Another example: take \(\alpha = \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, dividing \(\theta\) by \(\theta\), we get \(\xi = 1\), which is already in the ring, so the remainder is 0.

Alternatively, take \(\alpha = 1 + \theta\) and \(\beta = \theta\). Then, \(\xi = (1 + \theta)/\theta = 1/\theta + 1\). Since \(\theta\) satisfies \(\theta^2 = \theta + 3\), so \(1/\theta = (\theta - 1)/3\). Therefore, \(\xi = (\theta - 1)/3 + 1 = (theta - 1 + 3)/3 = (theta + 2)/3. So approximate this by some q in \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\). Let me compute the numerical values.

theta = (1 + sqrt(13))/2 ≈ (1 + 3.6055)/2 ≈ 4.6055/2 ≈ 2.30275.

So xi = (theta + 2)/3 ≈ (2.30275 + 2)/3 ≈ 4.30275/3 ≈ 1.43425.

So in terms of the basis {1, theta}, xi is approximately 1.43425. So express this as x + y theta, where x and y are rational numbers. Wait, but xi = (theta + 2)/3, which is (2)/3 + (1)/3 theta. So x = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 and y = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333. So we need to approximate x and y with integers m and n. The closest integers to x = 2/3 is m = 1 or 0. If we take m = 1, then n should be 0 or 1? Wait, y = 1/3. The closest integer to 1/3 is 0. So maybe take m = 1, n = 0. Then, q = 1 + 0*theta = 1. Then, the remainder is xi - q = (2/3 - 1) + (1/3 - 0) theta = (-1/3) + (1/3) theta. The norm of this is:

N(-1/3 + (1/3)theta) = (-1/3)^2 + (-1/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 1/9 - 1/9 - 3/9 = (-3)/9 = -1/3. Absolute value is 1/3, which is less than |N(beta)| = |N(theta)| = |1^2 + 1*1 - 3*1^2| = |1 + 1 - 3| = |-1| = 1. So 1/3 &lt; 1, which works. Therefore, the remainder has norm less than that of beta, so the division works.

Alternatively, if we choose m = 0 and n = 0, then q = 0. The remainder is xi - 0 = xi, whose norm is:

N(2/3 + (1/3)theta) = (2/3)^2 + (2/3)(1/3) - 3*(1/3)^2 = 4/9 + 2/9 - 3/9 = (4 + 2 - 3)/9 = 3/9 = 1/3. Absolute value 1/3 &lt; 1. So either way, we get a remainder with smaller norm.

Therefore, these examples support the conclusion that the ring is Euclidean.

Additionally, since the maximum norm on the fundamental domain was found to be 13/48 ≈ 0.27, which is less than 1, this implies that the ring is indeed norm-Euclidean.

Therefore, after this thorough check, I can conclude that \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain, we start by noting that this ring is the ring of integers of the quadratic field \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\). The element \(\theta = \frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\) is an algebraic integer with minimal polynomial \(x^2 - x - 3\), which confirms that \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) is indeed the ring of integers.

A key property of Euclidean domains is the existence of a Euclidean function, typically the absolute value of the norm in quadratic fields. For the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\theta]\), the norm of an element \(a + b\theta\) is given by \(N(a + b\theta) = a^2 + ab - 3b^2\). 

To verify the Euclidean property, we need to show that for any elements \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) with \(\beta \neq 0\), there exist \(\gamma, \rho \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(\alpha = \beta\gamma + \rho\) and \(N(\rho) &lt; N(\beta)\). This is equivalent to showing that for any \(\xi = \alpha / \beta \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that \(N(\xi - \gamma) &lt; 1\).

By analyzing the norm function and checking the maximum value of \(N(\xi - \gamma)\) over the fundamental domain, we find that the maximum norm on the square \([-1/2, 1/2] \times [-1/2, 1/2]\) is \(\frac{13}{48}\), which is less than 1. This ensures that for any \(\xi \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{13})\), there exists \(\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}[\theta]\) such that the norm of the remainder is less than the norm of \(\beta\).

Examples and calculations confirm that the division algorithm holds, and the norm function serves as a Euclidean function. Therefore, the ring \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\right]\) is a Euclidean domain.

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: By the Binomial Expansion Formula, \[\binom{20}{n}+\binom{20}{10}=\binom{20}{n}+\binom{20}{20-n}=\binom{20}{20-n}.\], Remembering the Binomial Expansion Formula, with the Distributive Property, \begin{align*} 20!(20-n)!\sum_{k=0}^{20-n}\binom{20}{k}\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^{2n} &amp;= 20!\sum_{k=0}^{20-n}\binom{20}{k}\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^{2n}\\ &amp;=21!\left(\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^{2n}. \end{align*}, then looking at the question, \[\boxed{11}. \qedhere\]          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: From Pascal&#x27;s identity $\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\binom{n-1}{k}=\binom{n}{k}$.

Therefore, we have $\binom{20}{11}+\binom{20}{10}=\binom{21}{11}$, so $n=11$.

We know that $\binom{21}{11}=\binom{21}{21-11}=\binom{21}{10}$.

We use Pascal&#x27;s identity again to get $\binom{20}{9}+\binom{20}{10}=\binom{21}{10}$, so $n=9$.

There are two values for $n$, $9$ and $11$, so the sum is $9+11=\boxed{20}$.          </p>

Problem: What is the sum of all integer values $n$ for which $\binom{20}{n}+\binom{20}{10}=\binom{21}{11}$? Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: We can solve this equation to get the following: \[\binom{20}{n}-9=441-\binom{11}{11}-\binom{11}{20}.\] Let&#x27;s rewrite this as \[315n+\binom{10}{10}=411\big(\binom{10}{10}\big). \nonumber \] This gives $n=10$. Therefore the sum of all the possible values of $n$ is $10$. \boxed{10}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: From Pascal&#x27;s identity $\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\binom{n-1}{k}=\binom{n}{k}$.

Therefore, we have $\binom{20}{11}+\binom{20}{10}=\binom{21}{11}$, so $n=11$.

We know that $\binom{21}{11}=\binom{21}{21-11}=\binom{21}{10}$.

We use Pascal&#x27;s identity again to get $\binom{20}{9}+\binom{20}{10}=\binom{21}{10}$, so $n=9$.

There are two values for $n$, $9$ and $11$, so the sum is $9+11=\boxed{20}$.          </p>

Response: Using the Binomial Theorem gives: \begin{align} (x+1)^{21} &amp;= (x+1)^{20}(x+1) + \binom{20}{1}x^{20} + \binom{20}{2}x^{19} + \binom{20}{3}x^{18} + \cdots + \binom{20}{20}x + \binom{20}{21} \\ &amp;= \binom{20}{10}x^{11} + \frac{20!}{(20-n)!n!}x^{21-n} + \frac{20!}{(20-n-1)!n!}x^{21-n-1} + \cdots + \frac{20!}{n!20!}x^{21} +1 \\ &amp;= \binom{21}{11}x^0 + \binom{20}{11}x^{10} + \cdots + \binom{0}{11}x^0. \end{align} The sum of the coefficients of the same power of $x$ are constant.

Problem: Determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: Yes, a good parallelepiped is always larger than any good sphere. This allows a tetrahedron to be placed inside. \boxed{Yes}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped are. A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, right? And a parallelepiped is like a 3D figure formed by six parallelograms. Now, the problem mentions &quot;good&quot; tetrahedron and &quot;good&quot; parallelepiped. I wonder what makes them &quot;good&quot;? Maybe they have some specific properties? Let me check.

Wait, maybe &quot;good&quot; here means that the tetrahedron is non-degenerate, so it has a positive volume, and similarly, the parallelepiped is non-degenerate with all edges contributing to a positive volume. That makes sense. So, a good tetrahedron is one where the four vertices aren&#x27;t all coplanar, and a good parallelepiped is one where the three vectors defining it aren&#x27;t coplanar either. So, both have positive volume. Alright.

So, the question is: Given any tetrahedron with positive volume, can it fit inside any parallelepiped with positive volume? Hmm. That seems a bit general. Maybe I need to think about the dimensions. A parallelepiped is determined by three vectors, and its volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of those vectors. A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is 1/6 of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors from one vertex. So, maybe there&#x27;s a relationship there?

But wait, the tetrahedron and the parallelepiped could have different orientations. Maybe the issue is whether, regardless of how the tetrahedron is shaped, as long as it&#x27;s non-degenerate, there exists a way to position it inside any non-degenerate parallelepiped. But that seems too broad. For example, if the parallelepiped is very small, how can a tetrahedron with a certain volume fit inside it?

Wait, but maybe the problem is about whether the tetrahedron can be scaled or something? But the question says &quot;placed inside,&quot; which I think means without scaling. So, the original tetrahedron has to fit inside the parallelepiped as is. But then, if the parallelepiped is smaller in some dimensions, the tetrahedron might not fit. So maybe the answer is no?

But the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, regardless of the sizes, can you always fit one into the other? That seems unlikely. For example, if the parallelepiped is very &quot;flat,&quot; meaning one of its dimensions is very small, while the tetrahedron is quite &quot;tall&quot; in that dimension, then you couldn&#x27;t fit the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe &quot;good&quot; implies some additional constraints? Maybe all edges of the parallelepiped are of length at least some value, and the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges are bounded? Hmm, the problem statement just says &quot;good,&quot; which the user probably defines as non-degenerate. So, assuming positive volume for both. Then, the answer would depend on whether any tetrahedron, regardless of its shape and size, can fit inside any parallelepiped, regardless of its shape and size. Which is not possible because of scaling issues.

But maybe the problem allows for rotation and translation of the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped? So, if you can rotate the tetrahedron appropriately, maybe it can fit even if the parallelepiped is not aligned with the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges. But still, if the parallelepiped is smaller in all dimensions than the tetrahedron&#x27;s corresponding dimensions, even after rotation, it might not fit.

Wait, but how do we define the &quot;dimensions&quot; of a tetrahedron? A tetrahedron doesn&#x27;t have obvious length, width, and height like a box. Its size is more related to its edge lengths or its volume. Similarly, the parallelepiped has three edge vectors, so its &quot;size&quot; in different directions is determined by those vectors.

Maybe the key here is that given any tetrahedron, you can scale the parallelepiped to contain it, but the problem states &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so you can&#x27;t choose the parallelepiped&#x27;s size. Wait, no, the question is whether any tetrahedron can be placed inside any parallelepiped. So, given any tetrahedron and any parallelepiped, both non-degenerate, can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped? That seems impossible because you could have a very large tetrahedron and a very small parallelepiped.

But wait, maybe &quot;any&quot; here is in terms of shape, not size? Like, regardless of the proportions, but assuming they can be scaled? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling. So, I think the answer is no. For example, imagine a tetrahedron with edge lengths all equal to 1 meter, and a parallelepiped that&#x27;s 1 centimeter in each dimension. Clearly, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit inside. So, unless scaling is allowed, which the problem doesn&#x27;t state, the answer should be no.

But wait, maybe the problem is in a mathematical sense, where we can have any size as long as they are non-degenerate. But mathematically, size matters. If the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped, it can&#x27;t fit. So, unless there is a way to compress or expand, which isn&#x27;t mentioned, the answer is no.

But maybe the problem is considering that both are in some normalized form? For example, volume-wise. If both have unit volume, can any tetrahedron fit inside any parallelepiped? That might be a different question. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify normalization.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different context where &quot;good&quot; implies some other conditions. Wait, the user just said &quot;good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;good parallelepiped.&quot; Maybe in the context where &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron is such that it can fit into a unit cube, and the parallelepiped is also unit? But I need to go back to the original problem statement.

The original problem is: &quot;Determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, with the definitions of &quot;good&quot; being non-degenerate. So, each has positive volume. So, the question is: Given any two such shapes (tetrahedron and parallelepiped), can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped?

This seems like it&#x27;s asking if for all tetrahedrons T and for all parallelepipeds P (all non-degenerate), T can be placed inside P. Which is not true. For example, take a very &quot;large&quot; tetrahedron and a very &quot;small&quot; parallelepiped. The tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, maybe the question is reversed: Can any parallelepiped contain any tetrahedron? But still, no, because of size constraints.

But maybe the problem is in terms of similarity or something else. Wait, perhaps in terms of proportions rather than absolute size. For instance, regardless of the tetrahedron&#x27;s shape, there exists a parallelepiped with the same shape (up to scaling) that can contain it. But the problem says &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so the parallelepiped is given, not chosen based on the tetrahedron.

Wait, maybe the problem is more about the geometric relations, like whether the tetrahedron can be embedded inside the parallelepiped through affine transformations. But affine transformations can scale, rotate, shear, etc. If you allow affine transformations, then any tetrahedron can be transformed into any other tetrahedron, but the problem is about placing inside a parallelepiped. If you can apply affine transformations to the tetrahedron, then you can certainly fit it inside any parallelepiped, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify if such transformations are allowed.

But the wording is &quot;placed inside,&quot; which usually in geometry problems means using rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling or shearing. So, if you can only translate and rotate the tetrahedron, then whether it can fit inside the parallelepiped depends on their relative sizes and shapes.

Therefore, if the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped in some dimension, even after rotation, it can&#x27;t fit. For example, suppose the parallelepiped is a very thin rectangular prism (close to a flat box), and the tetrahedron is a regular tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the thickness of the prism. Then, no matter how you rotate the tetrahedron, its projection along the prism&#x27;s shortest axis would exceed the prism&#x27;s dimension in that axis. Hence, it can&#x27;t fit.

Therefore, the answer should be no. However, maybe there&#x27;s a different way to think about it. Let me consider specific examples.

Take a unit cube as the parallelepiped. Can any tetrahedron with, say, volume greater than 1/6 fit inside it? Wait, the maximum volume of a tetrahedron inside a cube is 1/3 (achieved by a corner tetrahedron). So, if a tetrahedron has a volume larger than 1/3, it can&#x27;t fit inside the cube. But the cube is a specific case of a parallelepiped. So, if I have a tetrahedron with volume larger than 1/3, then it can&#x27;t fit inside a unit cube. Therefore, such a tetrahedron cannot be placed inside a unit cube, even though both are &quot;good&quot; (non-degenerate). Therefore, the answer is no.

But wait, the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, in this case, there exists a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped (both good) such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. Therefore, the answer is no.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that you can choose the orientation and position of the tetrahedron within the parallelepiped. But even so, if the tetrahedron is too large in some direction, it can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different setting where scaling is allowed, but the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling, so I think it&#x27;s not.

Wait, but the problem might be in a mathematical context where sizes are not considered, but only the combinatorial or topological aspects. But in standard geometry, size matters. So, unless specified otherwise, we have to consider size.

Therefore, based on the above reasoning, the answer should be no. However, let me verify once more.

Suppose we have a tetrahedron with a very long edge. Then, the minimal parallelepiped that can contain it must have at least one edge as long as the longest edge of the tetrahedron. If the given parallelepiped doesn&#x27;t have any edge as long as that, then the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Therefore, unless the parallelepiped is at least as large as the tetrahedron in all dimensions, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Since &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped includes ones that are smaller in some dimensions, the answer is no.

Therefore, the answer is no, it is not possible to place any good tetrahedron inside any good parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a different interpretation. Maybe the problem is in terms of combinatorial placement, like whether the vertices can be placed inside the parallelepiped regardless of the edges? But no, the tetrahedron is a solid, so all its points must be inside the parallelepiped.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about affine equivalence. But affine transformations can change the shape, but again, unless allowed, the answer remains no.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question. For example, since a tetrahedron can be decomposed into parallelepipeds or something? But that&#x27;s not standard.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that a tetrahedron can fit inside a parallelepiped if you can embed its vertices within the parallelepiped&#x27;s vertices, but that&#x27;s a different question. For example, a cube (a special case of a parallelepiped) can have a tetrahedron inscribed within it by connecting four of its vertices. But the problem is about any tetrahedron into any parallelepiped.

Wait, perhaps the key is that any tetrahedron can be affinely transformed into any other tetrahedron, but here we are dealing with a parallelepiped. If we can use affine transformations, then we can map a tetrahedron into a parallelepiped, but the problem states &quot;placed inside,&quot; which might not allow for such transformations.

Alternatively, consider that a parallelepiped can be divided into six tetrahedrons, each of which is similar to the others? Wait, no, not necessarily. A cube can be divided into six square pyramids, but that&#x27;s different.

Wait, perhaps the answer is yes, and I&#x27;m missing something. Let me think again.

Suppose we have any tetrahedron. Let&#x27;s consider its minimum bounding box. A bounding box is a parallelepiped (specifically, a rectangular prism if aligned with axes). Then, if we can show that any parallelepiped can contain any such bounding box, then the tetrahedron can be placed inside. But that&#x27;s not true because the bounding box&#x27;s dimensions depend on the tetrahedron, and the given parallelepiped might not have the required dimensions.

Alternatively, maybe by rotating the tetrahedron, we can fit it into a smaller parallelepiped? For example, the minimal volume parallelepiped enclosing a tetrahedron can be found by rotating the tetrahedron such that its edges align with the parallelepiped&#x27;s vectors. However, the volume of the minimal enclosing parallelepiped would depend on the tetrahedron&#x27;s geometry.

But the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, which might have a different orientation and size. So, even if the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal enclosing parallelepiped is smaller, the given parallelepiped might not have the right orientation or size.

Wait, perhaps if the parallelepiped is scaled such that it can contain the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal bounding parallelepiped. But the problem doesn&#x27;t allow scaling the parallelepiped. The parallelepiped is given, and we need to fit the tetrahedron inside it as is.

Alternatively, if the given parallelepiped is larger in all directions than the minimal bounding parallelepiped of the tetrahedron, then it can fit. But since the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, including smaller ones, the answer remains no.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a way to fold the tetrahedron into the parallelepiped? But in three-dimensional geometry, folding isn&#x27;t possible without tearing, so that&#x27;s not applicable.

Alternatively, using some projection or something? I don&#x27;t think so. To place a tetrahedron inside a parallelepiped, all its vertices must lie within the parallelepiped, and the edges must connect those vertices inside the parallelepiped. But if the parallelepiped is too small in some direction, the tetrahedron&#x27;s vertex coordinates would exceed the parallelepiped&#x27;s bounds in that direction.

Therefore, considering all this, the answer should be no. There exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of the parallelepiped cannot fit.

But maybe the problem uses &quot;good&quot; in a different way. Maybe a good tetrahedron is one that is contained within a unit cube, and a good parallelepiped is one that contains a unit cube? Then, perhaps any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. But that&#x27;s speculative. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Alternatively, if &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron has edges no longer than the edges of the parallelepiped. But again, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Therefore, given the problem as stated, with &quot;good&quot; meaning non-degenerate (positive volume), the answer is no. Because you can always find a tetrahedron too large to fit into a given parallelepiped, and a parallelepiped too small to contain a given tetrahedron.

Thus, the conclusion is that it&#x27;s not possible for any good tetrahedron to be placed inside any good parallelepiped. So, the answer is no.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped, we need to consider the definitions of &quot;good&quot; as non-degenerate, meaning both have positive volume. 

A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, and a parallelepiped is a three-dimensional figure formed by six parallelograms. The key points considered are:

1. **Volume Consideration**: A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors, while a parallelepiped&#x27;s volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its defining vectors. However, volume alone does not guarantee fitting one inside the other due to size constraints.
   
2. **Size and Shape Constraints**: A tetrahedron with a large volume or specific dimensions (e.g., long edge lengths) might not fit inside a parallelepiped with smaller dimensions. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of a parallelepiped cannot fit, regardless of rotation or translation.

3. **Rigid Transformations**: The problem implies placing the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped using only rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling. If a tetrahedron is too large in any dimension, it cannot fit inside a smaller parallelepiped even after rotation.

4. **Counterexamples**: Specific examples, such as a tetrahedron with a volume larger than the maximum volume that can fit inside a unit cube (which is \( \frac{1}{3} \)), demonstrate that it is not always possible to fit any tetrahedron inside any parallelepiped.

Given these considerations, it is concluded that there exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped due to size constraints. Therefore, the answer is:

Response: The answer is yes. If we have a parallelepiped, we can find the vectors with which the edges are parallel-aligned. Then, we create a tetrahedron with parallel-aligned sides.

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped are. A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, right? And a parallelepiped is like a 3D figure formed by six parallelograms. Now, the problem mentions &quot;good&quot; tetrahedron and &quot;good&quot; parallelepiped. I wonder what makes them &quot;good&quot;? Maybe they have some specific properties? Let me check.

Wait, maybe &quot;good&quot; here means that the tetrahedron is non-degenerate, so it has a positive volume, and similarly, the parallelepiped is non-degenerate with all edges contributing to a positive volume. That makes sense. So, a good tetrahedron is one where the four vertices aren&#x27;t all coplanar, and a good parallelepiped is one where the three vectors defining it aren&#x27;t coplanar either. So, both have positive volume. Alright.

So, the question is: Given any tetrahedron with positive volume, can it fit inside any parallelepiped with positive volume? Hmm. That seems a bit general. Maybe I need to think about the dimensions. A parallelepiped is determined by three vectors, and its volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of those vectors. A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is 1/6 of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors from one vertex. So, maybe there&#x27;s a relationship there?

But wait, the tetrahedron and the parallelepiped could have different orientations. Maybe the issue is whether, regardless of how the tetrahedron is shaped, as long as it&#x27;s non-degenerate, there exists a way to position it inside any non-degenerate parallelepiped. But that seems too broad. For example, if the parallelepiped is very small, how can a tetrahedron with a certain volume fit inside it?

Wait, but maybe the problem is about whether the tetrahedron can be scaled or something? But the question says &quot;placed inside,&quot; which I think means without scaling. So, the original tetrahedron has to fit inside the parallelepiped as is. But then, if the parallelepiped is smaller in some dimensions, the tetrahedron might not fit. So maybe the answer is no?

But the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, regardless of the sizes, can you always fit one into the other? That seems unlikely. For example, if the parallelepiped is very &quot;flat,&quot; meaning one of its dimensions is very small, while the tetrahedron is quite &quot;tall&quot; in that dimension, then you couldn&#x27;t fit the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe &quot;good&quot; implies some additional constraints? Maybe all edges of the parallelepiped are of length at least some value, and the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges are bounded? Hmm, the problem statement just says &quot;good,&quot; which the user probably defines as non-degenerate. So, assuming positive volume for both. Then, the answer would depend on whether any tetrahedron, regardless of its shape and size, can fit inside any parallelepiped, regardless of its shape and size. Which is not possible because of scaling issues.

But maybe the problem allows for rotation and translation of the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped? So, if you can rotate the tetrahedron appropriately, maybe it can fit even if the parallelepiped is not aligned with the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges. But still, if the parallelepiped is smaller in all dimensions than the tetrahedron&#x27;s corresponding dimensions, even after rotation, it might not fit.

Wait, but how do we define the &quot;dimensions&quot; of a tetrahedron? A tetrahedron doesn&#x27;t have obvious length, width, and height like a box. Its size is more related to its edge lengths or its volume. Similarly, the parallelepiped has three edge vectors, so its &quot;size&quot; in different directions is determined by those vectors.

Maybe the key here is that given any tetrahedron, you can scale the parallelepiped to contain it, but the problem states &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so you can&#x27;t choose the parallelepiped&#x27;s size. Wait, no, the question is whether any tetrahedron can be placed inside any parallelepiped. So, given any tetrahedron and any parallelepiped, both non-degenerate, can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped? That seems impossible because you could have a very large tetrahedron and a very small parallelepiped.

But wait, maybe &quot;any&quot; here is in terms of shape, not size? Like, regardless of the proportions, but assuming they can be scaled? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling. So, I think the answer is no. For example, imagine a tetrahedron with edge lengths all equal to 1 meter, and a parallelepiped that&#x27;s 1 centimeter in each dimension. Clearly, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit inside. So, unless scaling is allowed, which the problem doesn&#x27;t state, the answer should be no.

But wait, maybe the problem is in a mathematical sense, where we can have any size as long as they are non-degenerate. But mathematically, size matters. If the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped, it can&#x27;t fit. So, unless there is a way to compress or expand, which isn&#x27;t mentioned, the answer is no.

But maybe the problem is considering that both are in some normalized form? For example, volume-wise. If both have unit volume, can any tetrahedron fit inside any parallelepiped? That might be a different question. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify normalization.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different context where &quot;good&quot; implies some other conditions. Wait, the user just said &quot;good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;good parallelepiped.&quot; Maybe in the context where &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron is such that it can fit into a unit cube, and the parallelepiped is also unit? But I need to go back to the original problem statement.

The original problem is: &quot;Determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, with the definitions of &quot;good&quot; being non-degenerate. So, each has positive volume. So, the question is: Given any two such shapes (tetrahedron and parallelepiped), can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped?

This seems like it&#x27;s asking if for all tetrahedrons T and for all parallelepipeds P (all non-degenerate), T can be placed inside P. Which is not true. For example, take a very &quot;large&quot; tetrahedron and a very &quot;small&quot; parallelepiped. The tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, maybe the question is reversed: Can any parallelepiped contain any tetrahedron? But still, no, because of size constraints.

But maybe the problem is in terms of similarity or something else. Wait, perhaps in terms of proportions rather than absolute size. For instance, regardless of the tetrahedron&#x27;s shape, there exists a parallelepiped with the same shape (up to scaling) that can contain it. But the problem says &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so the parallelepiped is given, not chosen based on the tetrahedron.

Wait, maybe the problem is more about the geometric relations, like whether the tetrahedron can be embedded inside the parallelepiped through affine transformations. But affine transformations can scale, rotate, shear, etc. If you allow affine transformations, then any tetrahedron can be transformed into any other tetrahedron, but the problem is about placing inside a parallelepiped. If you can apply affine transformations to the tetrahedron, then you can certainly fit it inside any parallelepiped, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify if such transformations are allowed.

For example, suppose the parallelepiped is a very thin rectangular prism (close to a flat box), and the tetrahedron is a regular tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the thickness of the prism. Then, no matter how you rotate the tetrahedron, its projection along the prism&#x27;s shortest axis would exceed the prism&#x27;s dimension in that axis. Hence, it can&#x27;t fit.

Therefore, the answer should be no. However, maybe there&#x27;s a different way to think about it. Let me consider specific examples.

Take a unit cube as the parallelepiped. Can any tetrahedron with, say, volume greater than 1/6 fit inside it? Wait, the maximum volume of a tetrahedron inside a cube is 1/3 (achieved by a corner tetrahedron). So, if a tetrahedron has a volume larger than 1/3, it can&#x27;t fit inside the cube. But the cube is a specific case of a parallelepiped. So, if I have a tetrahedron with volume larger than 1/3, then it can&#x27;t fit inside a unit cube. Therefore, such a tetrahedron cannot be placed inside a unit cube, even though both are &quot;good&quot; (non-degenerate). Therefore, the answer is no.

But wait, the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, in this case, there exists a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped (both good) such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. Therefore, the answer is no.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that you can choose the orientation and position of the tetrahedron within the parallelepiped. But even so, if the tetrahedron is too large in some direction, it can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different setting where scaling is allowed, but the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling, so I think it&#x27;s not.

Therefore, based on the above reasoning, the answer should be no. However, let me verify once more.

Suppose we have a tetrahedron with a very long edge. Then, the minimal parallelepiped that can contain it must have at least one edge as long as the longest edge of the tetrahedron. If the given parallelepiped doesn&#x27;t have any edge as long as that, then the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Therefore, unless the parallelepiped is at least as large as the tetrahedron in all dimensions, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Since &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped includes ones that are smaller in some dimensions, the answer is no.

Therefore, the answer is no, it is not possible to place any good tetrahedron inside any good parallelepiped.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about affine equivalence. But affine transformations can change the shape, but again, unless allowed, the answer remains no.

If we can use affine transformations, then we can map a tetrahedron into a parallelepiped, but the problem states &quot;placed inside,&quot; which might not allow for such transformations.

Alternatively, consider that a parallelepiped can be divided into six tetrahedrons, each of which is similar to the others? Wait, no, not necessarily. A cube can be divided into six square pyramids, but that&#x27;s different.

Wait, perhaps the answer is yes, and I&#x27;m missing something. Let me think again.

Suppose we have any tetrahedron. Let&#x27;s consider its minimum bounding box. A bounding box is a parallelepiped (specifically, a rectangular prism if aligned with axes). Then, if we can show that any parallelepiped can contain any such bounding box, then the tetrahedron can be placed inside. But that&#x27;s not true because the bounding box&#x27;s dimensions depend on the tetrahedron, and the given parallelepiped might not have the required dimensions.

Alternatively, maybe by rotating the tetrahedron, we can fit it into a smaller parallelepiped? For example, the minimal volume parallelepiped enclosing a tetrahedron can be found by rotating the tetrahedron such that its edges align with the parallelepiped&#x27;s vectors. However, the volume of the minimal enclosing parallelepiped would depend on the tetrahedron&#x27;s geometry.

But the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, which might have a different orientation and size. So, even if the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal enclosing parallelepiped is smaller, the given parallelepiped might not have the right orientation or size.

Wait, perhaps if the parallelepiped is scaled such that it can contain the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal bounding parallelepiped. But the problem doesn&#x27;t allow scaling the parallelepiped. The parallelepiped is given, and we need to fit the tetrahedron inside it as is.

Alternatively, if the given parallelepiped is larger in all directions than the minimal bounding parallelepiped of the tetrahedron, then it can fit. But since the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, including smaller ones, the answer remains no.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a way to fold the tetrahedron into the parallelepiped? But in three-dimensional geometry, folding isn&#x27;t possible without tearing, so that&#x27;s not applicable.

Alternatively, using some projection or something? I don&#x27;t think so. To place a tetrahedron inside a parallelepiped, all its vertices must lie within the parallelepiped, and the edges must connect those vertices inside the parallelepiped. But if the parallelepiped is too small in some direction, the tetrahedron&#x27;s vertex coordinates would exceed the parallelepiped&#x27;s bounds in that direction.

Therefore, considering all this, the answer should be no. There exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of the parallelepiped cannot fit.

But maybe the problem uses &quot;good&quot; in a different way. Maybe a good tetrahedron is one that is contained within a unit cube, and a good parallelepiped is one that contains a unit cube? Then, perhaps any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. But that&#x27;s speculative. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Alternatively, if &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron has edges no longer than the edges of the parallelepiped. But again, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Therefore, given the problem as stated, with &quot;good&quot; meaning non-degenerate (positive volume), the answer is no. Because you can always find a tetrahedron too large to fit into a given parallelepiped, and a parallelepiped too small to contain a given tetrahedron.

Thus, the conclusion is that it&#x27;s not possible for any good tetrahedron to be placed inside any good parallelepiped. So, the answer is no.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped, we need to consider the definitions of &quot;good&quot; as non-degenerate, meaning both have positive volume. 

A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, and a parallelepiped is a three-dimensional figure formed by six parallelograms. The key points considered are:

1. **Volume Consideration**: A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors, while a parallelepiped&#x27;s volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its defining vectors. However, volume alone does not guarantee fitting one inside the other due to size constraints.
   
2. **Size and Shape Constraints**: A tetrahedron with a large volume or specific dimensions (e.g., long edge lengths) might not fit inside a parallelepiped with smaller dimensions. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of a parallelepiped cannot fit, regardless of rotation or translation.

3. **Rigid Transformations**: The problem implies placing the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped using only rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling. If a tetrahedron is too large in any dimension, it cannot fit inside a smaller parallelepiped even after rotation.

4. **Counterexamples**: Specific examples, such as a tetrahedron with a volume larger than the maximum volume that can fit inside a unit cube (which is \( \frac{1}{3} \)), demonstrate that it is not always possible to fit any tetrahedron inside any parallelepiped.

Given these considerations, it is concluded that there exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped due to size constraints. Therefore, the answer is:

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped are. A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, right? And a parallelepiped is like a 3D figure formed by six parallelograms. Now, the problem mentions &quot;good&quot; tetrahedron and &quot;good&quot; parallelepiped. I wonder what makes them &quot;good&quot;? Maybe they have some specific properties? Let me check.

Wait, maybe &quot;good&quot; here means that the tetrahedron is non-degenerate, so it has a positive volume, and similarly, the parallelepiped is non-degenerate with all edges contributing to a positive volume. That makes sense. So, a good tetrahedron is one where the four vertices aren&#x27;t all coplanar, and a good parallelepiped is one where the three vectors defining it aren&#x27;t coplanar either. So, both have positive volume. Alright.

So, the question is: Given any tetrahedron with positive volume, can it fit inside any parallelepiped with positive volume? Hmm. That seems a bit general. Maybe I need to think about the dimensions. A parallelepiped is determined by three vectors, and its volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of those vectors. A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is 1/6 of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors from one vertex. So, maybe there&#x27;s a relationship there?

But wait, the tetrahedron and the parallelepiped could have different orientations. Maybe the issue is whether, regardless of how the tetrahedron is shaped, as long as it&#x27;s non-degenerate, there exists a way to position it inside any non-degenerate parallelepiped. But that seems too broad. For example, if the parallelepiped is very small, how can a tetrahedron with a certain volume fit inside it?

Wait, but maybe the problem is about whether the tetrahedron can be scaled or something? But the question says &quot;placed inside,&quot; which I think means without scaling. So, the original tetrahedron has to fit inside the parallelepiped as is. But then, if the parallelepiped is smaller in some dimensions, the tetrahedron might not fit. So maybe the answer is no?

But the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, regardless of the sizes, can you always fit one into the other? That seems unlikely. For example, if the parallelepiped is very &quot;flat,&quot; meaning one of its dimensions is very small, while the tetrahedron is quite &quot;tall&quot; in that dimension, then you couldn&#x27;t fit the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe &quot;good&quot; implies some additional constraints? Maybe all edges of the parallelepiped are of length at least some value, and the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges are bounded? Hmm, the problem statement just says &quot;good,&quot; which the user probably defines as non-degenerate. So, assuming positive volume for both. Then, the answer would depend on whether any tetrahedron, regardless of its shape and size, can fit inside any parallelepiped, regardless of its shape and size. Which is not possible because of scaling issues.

But maybe the problem allows for rotation and translation of the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped? So, if you can rotate the tetrahedron appropriately, maybe it can fit even if the parallelepiped is not aligned with the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges. But still, if the parallelepiped is smaller in all dimensions than the tetrahedron&#x27;s corresponding dimensions, even after rotation, it might not fit.

Wait, but how do we define the &quot;dimensions&quot; of a tetrahedron? A tetrahedron doesn&#x27;t have obvious length, width, and height like a box. Its size is more related to its edge lengths or its volume. Similarly, the parallelepiped has three edge vectors, so its &quot;size&quot; in different directions is determined by those vectors.

Maybe the key here is that given any tetrahedron, you can scale the parallelepiped to contain it, but the problem states &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so you can&#x27;t choose the parallelepiped&#x27;s size. Wait, no, the question is whether any tetrahedron can be placed inside any parallelepiped. So, given any tetrahedron and any parallelepiped, both non-degenerate, can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped? That seems impossible because you could have a very large tetrahedron and a very small parallelepiped.

But wait, maybe &quot;any&quot; here is in terms of shape, not size? Like, regardless of the proportions, but assuming they can be scaled? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling. So, I think the answer is no. For example, imagine a tetrahedron with edge lengths all equal to 1 meter, and a parallelepiped that&#x27;s 1 centimeter in each dimension. Clearly, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit inside. So, unless scaling is allowed, which the problem doesn&#x27;t state, the answer should be no.

But wait, maybe the problem is in a mathematical sense, where we can have any size as long as they are non-degenerate. But mathematically, size matters. If the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped, it can&#x27;t fit. So, unless there is a way to compress or expand, which isn&#x27;t mentioned, the answer is no.

But maybe the problem is considering that both are in some normalized form? For example, volume-wise. If both have unit volume, can any tetrahedron fit inside any parallelepiped? That might be a different question. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify normalization.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different context where &quot;good&quot; implies some other conditions. Wait, the user just said &quot;good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;good parallelepiped.&quot; Maybe in the context where &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron is such that it can fit into a unit cube, and the parallelepiped is also unit? But I need to go back to the original problem statement.

The original problem is: &quot;Determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, with the definitions of &quot;good&quot; being non-degenerate. So, each has positive volume. So, the question is: Given any two such shapes (tetrahedron and parallelepiped), can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped?

This seems like it&#x27;s asking if for all tetrahedrons T and for all parallelepipeds P (all non-degenerate), T can be placed inside P. Which is not true. For example, take a very &quot;large&quot; tetrahedron and a very &quot;small&quot; parallelepiped. The tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, maybe the question is reversed: Can any parallelepiped contain any tetrahedron? But still, no, because of size constraints.

But maybe the problem is in terms of similarity or something else. Wait, perhaps in terms of proportions rather than absolute size. For instance, regardless of the tetrahedron&#x27;s shape, there exists a parallelepiped with the same shape (up to scaling) that can contain it. But the problem says &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so the parallelepiped is given, not chosen based on the tetrahedron.

Wait, maybe the problem is more about the geometric relations, like whether the tetrahedron can be embedded inside the parallelepiped through affine transformations. But affine transformations can scale, rotate, shear, etc. If you allow affine transformations, then any tetrahedron can be transformed into any other tetrahedron, but the problem is about placing inside a parallelepiped. If you can apply affine transformations to the tetrahedron, then you can certainly fit it inside any parallelepiped, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify if such transformations are allowed.

But the wording is &quot;placed inside,&quot; which usually in geometry problems means using rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling or shearing. So, if you can only translate and rotate the tetrahedron, then whether it can fit inside the parallelepiped depends on their relative sizes and shapes.

Therefore, if the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped in some dimension, even after rotation, it can&#x27;t fit. For example, suppose the parallelepiped is a very thin rectangular prism (close to a flat box), and the tetrahedron is a regular tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the thickness of the prism. Then, no matter how you rotate the tetrahedron, its projection along the prism&#x27;s shortest axis would exceed the prism&#x27;s dimension in that axis. Hence, it can&#x27;t fit.

Therefore, the answer should be no. However, maybe there&#x27;s a different way to think about it. Let me consider specific examples.

Take a unit cube as the parallelepiped. Can any tetrahedron with, say, volume greater than 1/6 fit inside it? Wait, the maximum volume of a tetrahedron inside a cube is 1/3 (achieved by a corner tetrahedron). So, if a tetrahedron has a volume larger than 1/3, it can&#x27;t fit inside the cube. But the cube is a specific case of a parallelepiped. So, if I have a tetrahedron with volume larger than 1/3, then it can&#x27;t fit inside a unit cube. Therefore, such a tetrahedron cannot be placed inside a unit cube, even though both are &quot;good&quot; (non-degenerate). Therefore, the answer is no.

But wait, the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, in this case, there exists a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped (both good) such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. Therefore, the answer is no.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that you can choose the orientation and position of the tetrahedron within the parallelepiped. But even so, if the tetrahedron is too large in some direction, it can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different setting where scaling is allowed, but the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling, so I think it&#x27;s not.

Wait, but the problem might be in a mathematical context where sizes are not considered, but only the combinatorial or topological aspects. But in standard geometry, size matters. So, unless specified otherwise, we have to consider size.

Therefore, based on the above reasoning, the answer should be no. However, let me verify once more.

Suppose we have a tetrahedron with a very long edge. Then, the minimal parallelepiped that can contain it must have at least one edge as long as the longest edge of the tetrahedron. If the given parallelepiped doesn&#x27;t have any edge as long as that, then the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Therefore, unless the parallelepiped is at least as large as the tetrahedron in all dimensions, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Since &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped includes ones that are smaller in some dimensions, the answer is no.

Therefore, the answer is no, it is not possible to place any good tetrahedron inside any good parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a different interpretation. Maybe the problem is in terms of combinatorial placement, like whether the vertices can be placed inside the parallelepiped regardless of the edges? But no, the tetrahedron is a solid, so all its points must be inside the parallelepiped.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about affine equivalence. But affine transformations can change the shape, but again, unless allowed, the answer remains no.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question. For example, since a tetrahedron can be decomposed into parallelepipeds or something? But that&#x27;s not standard.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that a tetrahedron can fit inside a parallelepiped if you can embed its vertices within the parallelepiped&#x27;s vertices, but that&#x27;s a different question. For example, a cube (a special case of a parallelepiped) can have a tetrahedron inscribed within it by connecting four of its vertices. But the problem is about any tetrahedron into any parallelepiped.

Wait, perhaps the key is that any tetrahedron can be affinely transformed into any other tetrahedron, but here we are dealing with a parallelepiped. If we can use affine transformations, then we can map a tetrahedron into a parallelepiped, but the problem states &quot;placed inside,&quot; which might not allow for such transformations.

Alternatively, consider that a parallelepiped can be divided into six tetrahedrons, each of which is similar to the others? Wait, no, not necessarily. A cube can be divided into six square pyramids, but that&#x27;s different.

Wait, perhaps the answer is yes, and I&#x27;m missing something. Let me think again.

Suppose we have any tetrahedron. Let&#x27;s consider its minimum bounding box. A bounding box is a parallelepiped (specifically, a rectangular prism if aligned with axes). Then, if we can show that any parallelepiped can contain any such bounding box, then the tetrahedron can be placed inside. But that&#x27;s not true because the bounding box&#x27;s dimensions depend on the tetrahedron, and the given parallelepiped might not have the required dimensions.

Alternatively, maybe by rotating the tetrahedron, we can fit it into a smaller parallelepiped? For example, the minimal volume parallelepiped enclosing a tetrahedron can be found by rotating the tetrahedron such that its edges align with the parallelepiped&#x27;s vectors. However, the volume of the minimal enclosing parallelepiped would depend on the tetrahedron&#x27;s geometry.

But the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, which might have a different orientation and size. So, even if the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal enclosing parallelepiped is smaller, the given parallelepiped might not have the right orientation or size.

Wait, perhaps if the parallelepiped is scaled such that it can contain the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal bounding parallelepiped. But the problem doesn&#x27;t allow scaling the parallelepiped. The parallelepiped is given, and we need to fit the tetrahedron inside it as is.

Alternatively, if the given parallelepiped is larger in all directions than the minimal bounding parallelepiped of the tetrahedron, then it can fit. But since the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, including smaller ones, the answer remains no.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a way to fold the tetrahedron into the parallelepiped? But in three-dimensional geometry, folding isn&#x27;t possible without tearing, so that&#x27;s not applicable.

Alternatively, using some projection or something? I don&#x27;t think so. To place a tetrahedron inside a parallelepiped, all its vertices must lie within the parallelepiped, and the edges must connect those vertices inside the parallelepiped. But if the parallelepiped is too small in some direction, the tetrahedron&#x27;s vertex coordinates would exceed the parallelepiped&#x27;s bounds in that direction.

Therefore, considering all this, the answer should be no. There exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of the parallelepiped cannot fit.

But maybe the problem uses &quot;good&quot; in a different way. Maybe a good tetrahedron is one that is contained within a unit cube, and a good parallelepiped is one that contains a unit cube? Then, perhaps any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. But that&#x27;s speculative. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Alternatively, if &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron has edges no longer than the edges of the parallelepiped. But again, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Therefore, given the problem as stated, with &quot;good&quot; meaning non-degenerate (positive volume), the answer is no. Because you can always find a tetrahedron too large to fit into a given parallelepiped, and a parallelepiped too small to contain a given tetrahedron.

Thus, the conclusion is that it&#x27;s not possible for any good tetrahedron to be placed inside any good parallelepiped. So, the answer is no.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped, we need to consider the definitions of &quot;good&quot; as non-degenerate, meaning both have positive volume. 

A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, and a parallelepiped is a three-dimensional figure formed by six parallelograms. The key points considered are:

1. **Volume Consideration**: A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors, while a parallelepiped&#x27;s volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its defining vectors. However, volume alone does not guarantee fitting one inside the other due to size constraints.
   
2. **Size and Shape Constraints**: A tetrahedron with a large volume or specific dimensions (e.g., long edge lengths) might not fit inside a parallelepiped with smaller dimensions. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of a parallelepiped cannot fit, regardless of rotation or translation.

3. **Rigid Transformations**: The problem implies placing the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped using only rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling. If a tetrahedron is too large in any dimension, it cannot fit inside a smaller parallelepiped even after rotation.

4. **Counterexamples**: Specific examples, such as a tetrahedron with a volume larger than the maximum volume that can fit inside a unit cube (which is \( \frac{1}{3} \)), demonstrate that it is not always possible to fit any tetrahedron inside any parallelepiped.

Given these considerations, it is concluded that there exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped due to size constraints. Therefore, the answer is:

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped are. A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, right? And a parallelepiped is like a 3D figure formed by six parallelograms. Now, the problem mentions &quot;good&quot; tetrahedron and &quot;good&quot; parallelepiped. I wonder what makes them &quot;good&quot;? Maybe they have some specific properties? Let me check.

Wait, maybe &quot;good&quot; here means that the tetrahedron is non-degenerate, so it has a positive volume, and similarly, the parallelepiped is non-degenerate with all edges contributing to a positive volume. That makes sense. So, a good tetrahedron is one where the four vertices aren&#x27;t all coplanar, and a good parallelepiped is one where the three vectors defining it aren&#x27;t coplanar either. So, both have positive volume. Alright.

So, the question is: Given any tetrahedron with positive volume, can it fit inside any parallelepiped with positive volume? Hmm. That seems a bit general. Maybe I need to think about the dimensions. A parallelepiped is determined by three vectors, and its volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of those vectors. A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is 1/6 of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors from one vertex. So, maybe there&#x27;s a relationship there?

But wait, the tetrahedron and the parallelepiped could have different orientations. Maybe the issue is whether, regardless of how the tetrahedron is shaped, as long as it&#x27;s non-degenerate, there exists a way to position it inside any non-degenerate parallelepiped. But that seems too broad. For example, if the parallelepiped is very small, how can a tetrahedron with a certain volume fit inside it?

Wait, but maybe the problem is about whether the tetrahedron can be scaled or something? But the question says &quot;placed inside,&quot; which I think means without scaling. So, the original tetrahedron has to fit inside the parallelepiped as is. But then, if the parallelepiped is smaller in some dimensions, the tetrahedron might not fit. So maybe the answer is no?

But the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, regardless of the sizes, can you always fit one into the other? That seems unlikely. For example, if the parallelepiped is very &quot;flat,&quot; meaning one of its dimensions is very small, while the tetrahedron is quite &quot;tall&quot; in that dimension, then you couldn&#x27;t fit the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe &quot;good&quot; implies some additional constraints? Maybe all edges of the parallelepiped are of length at least some value, and the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges are bounded? Hmm, the problem statement just says &quot;good,&quot; which the user probably defines as non-degenerate. So, assuming positive volume for both. Then, the answer would depend on whether any tetrahedron, regardless of its shape and size, can fit inside any parallelepiped, regardless of its shape and size. Which is not possible because of scaling issues.

But maybe the problem allows for rotation and translation of the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped? So, if you can rotate the tetrahedron appropriately, maybe it can fit even if the parallelepiped is not aligned with the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges. But still, if the parallelepiped is smaller in all dimensions than the tetrahedron&#x27;s corresponding dimensions, even after rotation, it might not fit.

Wait, but how do we define the &quot;dimensions&quot; of a tetrahedron? A tetrahedron doesn&#x27;t have obvious length, width, and height like a box. Its size is more related to its edge lengths or its volume. Similarly, the parallelepiped has three edge vectors, so its &quot;size&quot; in different directions is determined by those vectors.

Maybe the key here is that given any tetrahedron, you can scale the parallelepiped to contain it, but the problem states &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so you can&#x27;t choose the parallelepiped&#x27;s size. Wait, no, the question is whether any tetrahedron can be placed inside any parallelepiped. So, given any tetrahedron and any parallelepiped, both non-degenerate, can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped? That seems impossible because you could have a very large tetrahedron and a very small parallelepiped.

But wait, maybe &quot;any&quot; here is in terms of shape, not size? Like, regardless of the proportions, but assuming they can be scaled? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling. So, I think the answer is no. For example, imagine a tetrahedron with edge lengths all equal to 1 meter, and a parallelepiped that&#x27;s 1 centimeter in each dimension. Clearly, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit inside. So, unless scaling is allowed, which the problem doesn&#x27;t state, the answer should be no.

But wait, maybe the problem is in a mathematical sense, where we can have any size as long as they are non-degenerate. But mathematically, size matters. If the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped, it can&#x27;t fit. So, unless there is a way to compress or expand, which isn&#x27;t mentioned, the answer is no.

But I need to go back to the original problem statement.

The original problem is: &quot;Determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, with the definitions of &quot;good&quot; being non-degenerate. So, each has positive volume. So, the question is: Given any two such shapes (tetrahedron and parallelepiped), can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped?

This seems like it&#x27;s asking if for all tetrahedrons T and for all parallelepipeds P (all non-degenerate), T can be placed inside P. Which is not true. For example, take a very &quot;large&quot; tetrahedron and a very &quot;small&quot; parallelepiped. The tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, maybe the question is reversed: Can any parallelepiped contain any tetrahedron? But still, no, because of size constraints.

But maybe the problem is in terms of similarity or something else. Wait, perhaps in terms of proportions rather than absolute size. For instance, regardless of the tetrahedron&#x27;s shape, there exists a parallelepiped with the same shape (up to scaling) that can contain it. But the problem says &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so the parallelepiped is given, not chosen based on the tetrahedron.

Wait, maybe the problem is more about the geometric relations, like whether the tetrahedron can be embedded inside the parallelepiped through affine transformations. But affine transformations can scale, rotate, shear, etc. If you allow affine transformations, then any tetrahedron can be transformed into any other tetrahedron, but the problem is about placing inside a parallelepiped. If you can apply affine transformations to the tetrahedron, then you can certainly fit it inside any parallelepiped, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify if such transformations are allowed.

But the wording is &quot;placed inside,&quot; which usually in geometry problems means using rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling or shearing. So, if you can only translate and rotate the tetrahedron, then whether it can fit inside the parallelepiped depends on their relative sizes and shapes.

Therefore, if the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped in some dimension, even after rotation, it can&#x27;t fit. For example, suppose the parallelepiped is a very thin rectangular prism (close to a flat box), and the tetrahedron is a regular tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the thickness of the prism. Then, no matter how you rotate the tetrahedron, its projection along the prism&#x27;s shortest axis would exceed the prism&#x27;s dimension in that axis. Hence, it can&#x27;t fit.

Therefore, the answer should be no. However, maybe there&#x27;s a different way to think about it. Let me consider specific examples.

Take a unit cube as the parallelepiped. Can any tetrahedron with, say, volume greater than 1/6 fit inside it? Wait, the maximum volume of a tetrahedron inside a cube is 1/3 (achieved by a corner tetrahedron). So, if a tetrahedron has a volume larger than 1/3, it can&#x27;t fit inside the cube. But the cube is a specific case of a parallelepiped. So, if I have a tetrahedron with volume larger than 1/3, then it can&#x27;t fit inside a unit cube. Therefore, such a tetrahedron cannot be placed inside a unit cube, even though both are &quot;good&quot; (non-degenerate). Therefore, the answer is no.

But wait, the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, in this case, there exists a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped (both good) such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. Therefore, the answer is no.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that you can choose the orientation and position of the tetrahedron within the parallelepiped. But even so, if the tetrahedron is too large in some direction, it can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different setting where scaling is allowed, but the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling, so I think it&#x27;s not.

Wait, but the problem might be in a mathematical context where sizes are not considered, but only the combinatorial or topological aspects. But in standard geometry, size matters. So, unless specified otherwise, we have to consider size.

Therefore, based on the above reasoning, the answer should be no. However, let me verify once more.

Suppose we have a tetrahedron with a very long edge. Then, the minimal parallelepiped that can contain it must have at least one edge as long as the longest edge of the tetrahedron. If the given parallelepiped doesn&#x27;t have any edge as long as that, then the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Therefore, unless the parallelepiped is at least as large as the tetrahedron in all dimensions, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Since &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped includes ones that are smaller in some dimensions, the answer is no.

Therefore, the answer is no, it is not possible to place any good tetrahedron inside any good parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a different interpretation. Maybe the problem is in terms of combinatorial placement, like whether the vertices can be placed inside the parallelepiped regardless of the edges? But no, the tetrahedron is a solid, so all its points must be inside the parallelepiped.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about affine equivalence. But affine transformations can change the shape, but again, unless allowed, the answer remains no.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question. For example, since a tetrahedron can be decomposed into parallelepipeds or something? But that&#x27;s not standard.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that a tetrahedron can fit inside a parallelepiped if you can embed its vertices within the parallelepiped&#x27;s vertices, but that&#x27;s a different question. For example, a cube (a special case of a parallelepiped) can have a tetrahedron inscribed within it by connecting four of its vertices. But the problem is about any tetrahedron into any parallelepiped.

Wait, perhaps the key is that any tetrahedron can be affinely transformed into any other tetrahedron, but here we are dealing with a parallelepiped. If we can use affine transformations, then we can map a tetrahedron into a parallelepiped, but the problem states &quot;placed inside,&quot; which might not allow for such transformations.

Alternatively, consider that a parallelepiped can be divided into six tetrahedrons, each of which is similar to the others? Wait, no, not necessarily. A cube can be divided into six square pyramids, but that&#x27;s different.

Wait, perhaps the answer is yes, and I&#x27;m missing something. Let me think again.

Suppose we have any tetrahedron. Let&#x27;s consider its minimum bounding box. A bounding box is a parallelepiped (specifically, a rectangular prism if aligned with axes). Then, if we can show that any parallelepiped can contain any such bounding box, then the tetrahedron can be placed inside. But that&#x27;s not true because the bounding box&#x27;s dimensions depend on the tetrahedron, and the given parallelepiped might not have the required dimensions.

Alternatively, maybe by rotating the tetrahedron, we can fit it into a smaller parallelepiped? For example, the minimal volume parallelepiped enclosing a tetrahedron can be found by rotating the tetrahedron such that its edges align with the parallelepiped&#x27;s vectors. However, the volume of the minimal enclosing parallelepiped would depend on the tetrahedron&#x27;s geometry.

But the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, which might have a different orientation and size. So, even if the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal enclosing parallelepiped is smaller, the given parallelepiped might not have the right orientation or size.

Wait, perhaps if the parallelepiped is scaled such that it can contain the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal bounding parallelepiped. But the problem doesn&#x27;t allow scaling the parallelepiped. The parallelepiped is given, and we need to fit the tetrahedron inside it as is.

Alternatively, if the given parallelepiped is larger in all directions than the minimal bounding parallelepiped of the tetrahedron, then it can fit. But since the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, including smaller ones, the answer remains no.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a way to fold the tetrahedron into the parallelepiped? But in three-dimensional geometry, folding isn&#x27;t possible without tearing, so that&#x27;s not applicable.

Alternatively, using some projection or something? I don&#x27;t think so. To place a tetrahedron inside a parallelepiped, all its vertices must lie within the parallelepiped, and the edges must connect those vertices inside the parallelepiped. But if the parallelepiped is too small in some direction, the tetrahedron&#x27;s vertex coordinates would exceed the parallelepiped&#x27;s bounds in that direction.

Therefore, considering all this, the answer should be no. There exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of the parallelepiped cannot fit.

But maybe the problem uses &quot;good&quot; in a different way. Maybe a good tetrahedron is one that is contained within a unit cube, and a good parallelepiped is one that contains a unit cube? Then, perhaps any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. But that&#x27;s speculative. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Alternatively, if &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron has edges no longer than the edges of the parallelepiped. But again, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Therefore, given the problem as stated, with &quot;good&quot; meaning non-degenerate (positive volume), the answer is no. Because you can always find a tetrahedron too large to fit into a given parallelepiped, and a parallelepiped too small to contain a given tetrahedron.

Thus, the conclusion is that it&#x27;s not possible for any good tetrahedron to be placed inside any good parallelepiped. So, the answer is no.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped, we need to consider the definitions of &quot;good&quot; as non-degenerate, meaning both have positive volume. 

A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, and a parallelepiped is a three-dimensional figure formed by six parallelograms. The key points considered are:

1. **Volume Consideration**: A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors, while a parallelepiped&#x27;s volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its defining vectors. However, volume alone does not guarantee fitting one inside the other due to size constraints.
   
2. **Size and Shape Constraints**: A tetrahedron with a large volume or specific dimensions (e.g., long edge lengths) might not fit inside a parallelepiped with smaller dimensions. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of a parallelepiped cannot fit, regardless of rotation or translation.

3. **Rigid Transformations**: The problem implies placing the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped using only rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling. If a tetrahedron is too large in any dimension, it cannot fit inside a smaller parallelepiped even after rotation.

4. **Counterexamples**: Specific examples, such as a tetrahedron with a volume larger than the maximum volume that can fit inside a unit cube (which is \( \frac{1}{3} \)), demonstrate that it is not always possible to fit any tetrahedron inside any parallelepiped.

Given these considerations, it is concluded that there exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped due to size constraints. Therefore, the answer is:

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped are. A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, right? And a parallelepiped is like a 3D figure formed by six parallelograms. Now, the problem mentions &quot;good&quot; tetrahedron and &quot;good&quot; parallelepiped. I wonder what makes them &quot;good&quot;? Maybe they have some specific properties? Let me check.

Wait, maybe &quot;good&quot; here means that the tetrahedron is non-degenerate, so it has a positive volume, and similarly, the parallelepiped is non-degenerate with all edges contributing to a positive volume. That makes sense. So, a good tetrahedron is one where the four vertices aren&#x27;t all coplanar, and a good parallelepiped is one where the three vectors defining it aren&#x27;t coplanar either. So, both have positive volume. Alright.

So, the question is: Given any tetrahedron with positive volume, can it fit inside any parallelepiped with positive volume? Hmm. That seems a bit general. Maybe I need to think about the dimensions. A parallelepiped is determined by three vectors, and its volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of those vectors. A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is 1/6 of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors from one vertex. So, maybe there&#x27;s a relationship there?

But wait, the tetrahedron and the parallelepiped could have different orientations. Maybe the issue is whether, regardless of how the tetrahedron is shaped, as long as it&#x27;s non-degenerate, there exists a way to position it inside any non-degenerate parallelepiped. But that seems too broad. For example, if the parallelepiped is very small, how can a tetrahedron with a certain volume fit inside it?

Wait, but maybe the problem is about whether the tetrahedron can be scaled or something? But the question says &quot;placed inside,&quot; which I think means without scaling. So, the original tetrahedron has to fit inside the parallelepiped as is. But then, if the parallelepiped is smaller in some dimensions, the tetrahedron might not fit. So maybe the answer is no?

But the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, regardless of the sizes, can you always fit one into the other? That seems unlikely. For example, if the parallelepiped is very &quot;flat,&quot; meaning one of its dimensions is very small, while the tetrahedron is quite &quot;tall&quot; in that dimension, then you couldn&#x27;t fit the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe &quot;good&quot; implies some additional constraints? Maybe all edges of the parallelepiped are of length at least some value, and the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges are bounded? Hmm, the problem statement just says &quot;good,&quot; which the user probably defines as non-degenerate. So, assuming positive volume for both. Then, the answer would depend on whether any tetrahedron, regardless of its shape and size, can fit inside any parallelepiped, regardless of its shape and size. Which is not possible because of scaling issues.

But maybe the problem allows for rotation and translation of the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped? So, if you can rotate the tetrahedron appropriately, maybe it can fit even if the parallelepiped is not aligned with the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges. But still, if the parallelepiped is smaller in all dimensions than the tetrahedron&#x27;s corresponding dimensions, even after rotation, it might not fit.

Wait, but how do we define the &quot;dimensions&quot; of a tetrahedron? A tetrahedron doesn&#x27;t have obvious length, width, and height like a box. Its size is more related to its edge lengths or its volume. Similarly, the parallelepiped has three edge vectors, so its &quot;size&quot; in different directions is determined by those vectors.

Maybe the key here is that given any tetrahedron, you can scale the parallelepiped to contain it, but the problem states &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so you can&#x27;t choose the parallelepiped&#x27;s size. Wait, no, the question is whether any tetrahedron can be placed inside any parallelepiped. So, given any tetrahedron and any parallelepiped, both non-degenerate, can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped? That seems impossible because you could have a very large tetrahedron and a very small parallelepiped.

But wait, maybe &quot;any&quot; here is in terms of shape, not size? Like, regardless of the proportions, but assuming they can be scaled? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling. So, I think the answer is no. For example, imagine a tetrahedron with edge lengths all equal to 1 meter, and a parallelepiped that&#x27;s 1 centimeter in each dimension. Clearly, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit inside. So, unless scaling is allowed, which the problem doesn&#x27;t state, the answer should be no.

But wait, maybe the problem is in a mathematical sense, where we can have any size as long as they are non-degenerate. But mathematically, size matters. If the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped, it can&#x27;t fit. So, unless there is a way to compress or expand, which isn&#x27;t mentioned, the answer is no.

But maybe the problem is considering that both are in some normalized form? For example, volume-wise. If both have unit volume, can any tetrahedron fit inside any parallelepiped? That might be a different question. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify normalization.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different context where &quot;good&quot; implies some other conditions. Wait, the user just said &quot;good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;good parallelepiped.&quot; Maybe in the context where &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron is such that it can fit into a unit cube, and the parallelepiped is also unit? But I need to go back to the original problem statement.

The original problem is: &quot;Determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, with the definitions of &quot;good&quot; being non-degenerate. So, each has positive volume. So, the question is: Given any two such shapes (tetrahedron and parallelepiped), can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped?

This seems like it&#x27;s asking if for all tetrahedrons T and for all parallelepipeds P (all non-degenerate), T can be placed inside P. Which is not true. For example, take a very &quot;large&quot; tetrahedron and a very &quot;small&quot; parallelepiped. The tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, maybe the question is reversed: Can any parallelepiped contain any tetrahedron? But still, no, because of size constraints.

But maybe the problem is in terms of similarity or something else. Wait, perhaps in terms of proportions rather than absolute size. For instance, regardless of the tetrahedron&#x27;s shape, there exists a parallelepiped with the same shape (up to scaling) that can contain it. But the problem says &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so the parallelepiped is given, not chosen based on the tetrahedron.

Wait, maybe the problem is more about the geometric relations, like whether the tetrahedron can be embedded inside the parallelepiped through affine transformations. But affine transformations can scale, rotate, shear, etc. If you allow affine transformations, then any tetrahedron can be transformed into any other tetrahedron, but the problem is about placing inside a parallelepiped. If you can apply affine transformations to the tetrahedron, then you can certainly fit it inside any parallelepiped, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify if such transformations are allowed.

But the wording is &quot;placed inside,&quot; which usually in geometry problems means using rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling or shearing. So, if you can only translate and rotate the tetrahedron, then whether it can fit inside the parallelepiped depends on their relative sizes and shapes.

Therefore, if the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped in some dimension, even after rotation, it can&#x27;t fit. For example, suppose the parallelepiped is a very thin rectangular prism (close to a flat box), and the tetrahedron is a regular tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the thickness of the prism. Then, no matter how you rotate the tetrahedron, its projection along the prism&#x27;s shortest axis would exceed the prism&#x27;s dimension in that axis. Hence, it can&#x27;t fit.

Therefore, the answer should be no. However, maybe there&#x27;s a different way to think about it. Let me consider specific examples.

Take a unit cube as the parallelepiped. Can any tetrahedron with, say, volume greater than 1/6 fit inside it? Wait, the maximum volume of a tetrahedron inside a cube is 1/3 (achieved by a corner tetrahedron). So, if a tetrahedron has a volume larger than 1/3, it can&#x27;t fit inside the cube. But the cube is a specific case of a parallelepiped. So, if I have a tetrahedron with volume larger than 1/3, then it can&#x27;t fit inside a unit cube. Therefore, such a tetrahedron cannot be placed inside a unit cube, even though both are &quot;good&quot; (non-degenerate). Therefore, the answer is no.

But wait, the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, in this case, there exists a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped (both good) such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. Therefore, the answer is no.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that you can choose the orientation and position of the tetrahedron within the parallelepiped. But even so, if the tetrahedron is too large in some direction, it can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different setting where scaling is allowed, but the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling, so I think it&#x27;s not.

Wait, but the problem might be in a mathematical context where sizes are not considered, but only the combinatorial or topological aspects. But in standard geometry, size matters. So, unless specified otherwise, we have to consider size.

Therefore, based on the above reasoning, the answer should be no. However, let me verify once more.

Suppose we have a tetrahedron with a very long edge. Then, the minimal parallelepiped that can contain it must have at least one edge as long as the longest edge of the tetrahedron. If the given parallelepiped doesn&#x27;t have any edge as long as that, then the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Therefore, unless the parallelepiped is at least as large as the tetrahedron in all dimensions, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Since &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped includes ones that are smaller in some dimensions, the answer is no.

Therefore, the answer is no, it is not possible to place any good tetrahedron inside any good parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a different interpretation. Maybe the problem is in terms of combinatorial placement, like whether the vertices can be placed inside the parallelepiped regardless of the edges? But no, the tetrahedron is a solid, so all its points must be inside the parallelepiped.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about affine equivalence. But affine transformations can change the shape, but again, unless allowed, the answer remains no.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question. For example, since a tetrahedron can be decomposed into parallelepipeds or something? But that&#x27;s not standard.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that a tetrahedron can fit inside a parallelepiped if you can embed its vertices within the parallelepiped&#x27;s vertices, but that&#x27;s a different question. For example, a cube (a special case of a parallelepiped) can have a tetrahedron inscribed within it by connecting four of its vertices. But the problem is about any tetrahedron into any parallelepiped.

Wait, perhaps the key is that any tetrahedron can be affinely transformed into any other tetrahedron, but here we are dealing with a parallelepiped. If we can use affine transformations, then we can map a tetrahedron into a parallelepiped, but the problem states &quot;placed inside,&quot; which might not allow for such transformations.

Alternatively, consider that a parallelepiped can be divided into six tetrahedrons, each of which is similar to the others? Wait, no, not necessarily. A cube can be divided into six square pyramids, but that&#x27;s different.

Wait, perhaps the answer is yes, and I&#x27;m missing something. Let me think again.

Suppose we have any tetrahedron. Let&#x27;s consider its minimum bounding box. A bounding box is a parallelepiped (specifically, a rectangular prism if aligned with axes). Then, if we can show that any parallelepiped can contain any such bounding box, then the tetrahedron can be placed inside. But that&#x27;s not true because the bounding box&#x27;s dimensions depend on the tetrahedron, and the given parallelepiped might not have the required dimensions.

Alternatively, maybe by rotating the tetrahedron, we can fit it into a smaller parallelepiped? For example, the minimal volume parallelepiped enclosing a tetrahedron can be found by rotating the tetrahedron such that its edges align with the parallelepiped&#x27;s vectors. However, the volume of the minimal enclosing parallelepiped would depend on the tetrahedron&#x27;s geometry.

But the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, which might have a different orientation and size. So, even if the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal enclosing parallelepiped is smaller, the given parallelepiped might not have the right orientation or size.

Wait, perhaps if the parallelepiped is scaled such that it can contain the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal bounding parallelepiped. But the problem doesn&#x27;t allow scaling the parallelepiped. The parallelepiped is given, and we need to fit the tetrahedron inside it as is.

Alternatively, if the given parallelepiped is larger in all directions than the minimal bounding parallelepiped of the tetrahedron, then it can fit. But since the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, including smaller ones, the answer remains no.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a way to fold the tetrahedron into the parallelepiped? But in three-dimensional geometry, folding isn&#x27;t possible without tearing, so that&#x27;s not applicable.

Alternatively, using some projection or something? I don&#x27;t think so. To place a tetrahedron inside a parallelepiped, all its vertices must lie within the parallelepiped, and the edges must connect those vertices inside the parallelepiped. But if the parallelepiped is too small in some direction, the tetrahedron&#x27;s vertex coordinates would exceed the parallelepiped&#x27;s bounds in that direction.

Therefore, considering all this, the answer should be no. There exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of the parallelepiped cannot fit.

But maybe the problem uses &quot;good&quot; in a different way. Maybe a good tetrahedron is one that is contained within a unit cube, and a good parallelepiped is one that contains a unit cube? Then, perhaps any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. But that&#x27;s speculative. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Alternatively, if &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron has edges no longer than the edges of the parallelepiped. But again, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Therefore, given the problem as stated, with &quot;good&quot; meaning non-degenerate (positive volume), the answer is no. Because you can always find a tetrahedron too large to fit into a given parallelepiped, and a parallelepiped too small to contain a given tetrahedron.

Thus, the conclusion is that it&#x27;s not possible for any good tetrahedron to be placed inside any good parallelepiped. So, the answer is no.

Wait, maybe &quot;good&quot; here means that the tetrahedron is non-degenerate, so it has a positive volume, and similarly, the parallelepiped is non-degenerate with all edges contributing to a positive volume. That makes sense. So, a good tetrahedron is one where the four vertices aren&#x27;t all coplanar, and a good parallelepiped is one where the three vectors defining it aren&#x27;t coplanar either. So, both have positive volume. Alright.

So, the question is: Given any tetrahedron with positive volume, can it fit inside any parallelepiped with positive volume? Hmm. That seems a bit general. Maybe I need to think about the dimensions. A parallelepiped is determined by three vectors, and its volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of those vectors. A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is 1/6 of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors from one vertex. So, maybe there&#x27;s a relationship there?

But wait, the tetrahedron and the parallelepiped could have different orientations. Maybe the issue is whether, regardless of how the tetrahedron is shaped, as long as it&#x27;s non-degenerate, there exists a way to position it inside any non-degenerate parallelepiped. But that seems too broad. For example, if the parallelepiped is very small, how can a tetrahedron with a certain volume fit inside it?

Wait, but maybe the problem is about whether the tetrahedron can be scaled or something? But the question says &quot;placed inside,&quot; which I think means without scaling. So, the original tetrahedron has to fit inside the parallelepiped as is. But then, if the parallelepiped is smaller in some dimensions, the tetrahedron might not fit. So maybe the answer is no?

For example, if the parallelepiped is very &quot;flat,&quot; meaning one of its dimensions is very small, while the tetrahedron is quite &quot;tall&quot; in that dimension, then you couldn&#x27;t fit the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe &quot;good&quot; implies some additional constraints? Maybe all edges of the parallelepiped are of length at least some value, and the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges are bounded? Hmm, the problem statement just says &quot;good,&quot; which the user probably defines as non-degenerate. So, assuming positive volume for both. Then, the answer would depend on whether any tetrahedron, regardless of its shape and size, can fit inside any parallelepiped, regardless of its shape and size. Which is not possible because of scaling issues.

But maybe the problem allows for rotation and translation of the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped? So, if you can rotate the tetrahedron appropriately, maybe it can fit even if the parallelepiped is not aligned with the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges. But still, if the parallelepiped is smaller in all dimensions than the tetrahedron&#x27;s corresponding dimensions, even after rotation, it might not fit.

Wait, but how do we define the &quot;dimensions&quot; of a tetrahedron? A tetrahedron doesn&#x27;t have obvious length, width, and height like a box. Its size is more related to its edge lengths or its volume. Similarly, the parallelepiped has three edge vectors, so its &quot;size&quot; in different directions is determined by those vectors.

Maybe the key here is that given any tetrahedron, you can scale the parallelepiped to contain it, but the problem states &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so you can&#x27;t choose the parallelepiped&#x27;s size. Wait, no, the question is whether any tetrahedron can be placed inside any parallelepiped. So, given any tetrahedron and any parallelepiped, both non-degenerate, can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped? That seems impossible because you could have a very large tetrahedron and a very small parallelepiped.

But wait, maybe &quot;any&quot; here is in terms of shape, not size? Like, regardless of the proportions, but assuming they can be scaled? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling. So, I think the answer is no. For example, imagine a tetrahedron with edge lengths all equal to 1 meter, and a parallelepiped that&#x27;s 1 centimeter in each dimension.

But I need to go back to the original problem statement.

The original problem is: &quot;Determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, with the definitions of &quot;good&quot; being non-degenerate. So, each has positive volume. So, the question is: Given any two such shapes (tetrahedron and parallelepiped), can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped?

This seems like it&#x27;s asking if for all tetrahedrons T and for all parallelepipeds P (all non-degenerate), T can be placed inside P. Which is not true. For example, take a very &quot;large&quot; tetrahedron and a very &quot;small&quot; parallelepiped. The tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, maybe the question is reversed: Can any parallelepiped contain any tetrahedron? But still, no, because of size constraints.

But maybe the problem is in terms of similarity or something else. Wait, perhaps in terms of proportions rather than absolute size. For instance, regardless of the tetrahedron&#x27;s shape, there exists a parallelepiped with the same shape (up to scaling) that can contain it. But the problem says &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so the parallelepiped is given, not chosen based on the tetrahedron.

Wait, maybe the problem is more about the geometric relations, like whether the tetrahedron can be embedded inside the parallelepiped through affine transformations. But affine transformations can scale, rotate, shear, etc. If you allow affine transformations, then any tetrahedron can be transformed into any other tetrahedron, but the problem is about placing inside a parallelepiped. If you can apply affine transformations to the tetrahedron, then you can certainly fit it inside any parallelepiped, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify if such transformations are allowed.

Therefore, if the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped in some dimension, even after rotation, it can&#x27;t fit. For example, suppose the parallelepiped is a very thin rectangular prism (close to a flat box), and the tetrahedron is a regular tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the thickness of the prism. Then, no matter how you rotate the tetrahedron, its projection along the prism&#x27;s shortest axis would exceed the prism&#x27;s dimension in that axis. Hence, it can&#x27;t fit.

Therefore, the answer should be no. However, maybe there&#x27;s a different way to think about it. Let me consider specific examples.

Take a unit cube as the parallelepiped. Can any tetrahedron with, say, volume greater than 1/6 fit inside it? Wait, the maximum volume of a tetrahedron inside a cube is 1/3 (achieved by a corner tetrahedron). So, if a tetrahedron has a volume larger than 1/3, it can&#x27;t fit inside the cube. But the cube is a specific case of a parallelepiped. So, if I have a tetrahedron with volume larger than 1/3, then it can&#x27;t fit inside a unit cube. Therefore, such a tetrahedron cannot be placed inside a unit cube, even though both are &quot;good&quot; (non-degenerate). Therefore, the answer is no.

But wait, the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, in this case, there exists a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped (both good) such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. Therefore, the answer is no.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that you can choose the orientation and position of the tetrahedron within the parallelepiped. But even so, if the tetrahedron is too large in some direction, it can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different setting where scaling is allowed, but the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling, so I think it&#x27;s not.

Wait, but the problem might be in a mathematical context where sizes are not considered, but only the combinatorial or topological aspects. But in standard geometry, size matters. So, unless specified otherwise, we have to consider size.

Therefore, based on the above reasoning, the answer should be no. However, let me verify once more.

Suppose we have a tetrahedron with a very long edge. Then, the minimal parallelepiped that can contain it must have at least one edge as long as the longest edge of the tetrahedron. If the given parallelepiped doesn&#x27;t have any edge as long as that, then the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Therefore, unless the parallelepiped is at least as large as the tetrahedron in all dimensions, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Since &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped includes ones that are smaller in some dimensions, the answer is no.

Therefore, the answer is no, it is not possible to place any good tetrahedron inside any good parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a different interpretation. Maybe the problem is in terms of combinatorial placement, like whether the vertices can be placed inside the parallelepiped regardless of the edges? But no, the tetrahedron is a solid, so all its points must be inside the parallelepiped.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about affine equivalence. But affine transformations can change the shape, but again, unless allowed, the answer remains no.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question. For example, since a tetrahedron can be decomposed into parallelepipeds or something? But that&#x27;s not standard.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that a tetrahedron can fit inside a parallelepiped if you can embed its vertices within the parallelepiped&#x27;s vertices, but that&#x27;s a different question. For example, a cube (a special case of a parallelepiped) can have a tetrahedron inscribed within it by connecting four of its vertices. But the problem is about any tetrahedron into any parallelepiped.

Wait, perhaps the key is that any tetrahedron can be affinely transformed into any other tetrahedron, but here we are dealing with a parallelepiped. If we can use affine transformations, then we can map a tetrahedron into a parallelepiped, but the problem states &quot;placed inside,&quot; which might not allow for such transformations.

Alternatively, consider that a parallelepiped can be divided into six tetrahedrons, each of which is similar to the others? Wait, no, not necessarily. A cube can be divided into six square pyramids, but that&#x27;s different.

Wait, perhaps the answer is yes, and I&#x27;m missing something. Let me think again.

Suppose we have any tetrahedron. Let&#x27;s consider its minimum bounding box. A bounding box is a parallelepiped (specifically, a rectangular prism if aligned with axes). Then, if we can show that any parallelepiped can contain any such bounding box, then the tetrahedron can be placed inside. But that&#x27;s not true because the bounding box&#x27;s dimensions depend on the tetrahedron, and the given parallelepiped might not have the required dimensions.

Alternatively, maybe by rotating the tetrahedron, we can fit it into a smaller parallelepiped? For example, the minimal volume parallelepiped enclosing a tetrahedron can be found by rotating the tetrahedron such that its edges align with the parallelepiped&#x27;s vectors. However, the volume of the minimal enclosing parallelepiped would depend on the tetrahedron&#x27;s geometry.

But the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, which might have a different orientation and size. So, even if the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal enclosing parallelepiped is smaller, the given parallelepiped might not have the right orientation or size.

Wait, perhaps if the parallelepiped is scaled such that it can contain the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal bounding parallelepiped. But the problem doesn&#x27;t allow scaling the parallelepiped. The parallelepiped is given, and we need to fit the tetrahedron inside it as is.

Alternatively, if the given parallelepiped is larger in all directions than the minimal bounding parallelepiped of the tetrahedron, then it can fit. But since the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, including smaller ones, the answer remains no.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a way to fold the tetrahedron into the parallelepiped? But in three-dimensional geometry, folding isn&#x27;t possible without tearing, so that&#x27;s not applicable.

Alternatively, using some projection or something? I don&#x27;t think so. To place a tetrahedron inside a parallelepiped, all its vertices must lie within the parallelepiped, and the edges must connect those vertices inside the parallelepiped. But if the parallelepiped is too small in some direction, the tetrahedron&#x27;s vertex coordinates would exceed the parallelepiped&#x27;s bounds in that direction.

Therefore, considering all this, the answer should be no. There exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of the parallelepiped cannot fit.

But maybe the problem uses &quot;good&quot; in a different way. Maybe a good tetrahedron is one that is contained within a unit cube, and a good parallelepiped is one that contains a unit cube? Then, perhaps any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. But that&#x27;s speculative. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Alternatively, if &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron has edges no longer than the edges of the parallelepiped. But again, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Therefore, given the problem as stated, with &quot;good&quot; meaning non-degenerate (positive volume), the answer is no. Because you can always find a tetrahedron too large to fit into a given parallelepiped, and a parallelepiped too small to contain a given tetrahedron.

Thus, the conclusion is that it&#x27;s not possible for any good tetrahedron to be placed inside any good parallelepiped. So, the answer is no.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped, we need to consider the definitions of &quot;good&quot; as non-degenerate, meaning both have positive volume. 

A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, and a parallelepiped is a three-dimensional figure formed by six parallelograms. The key points considered are:

1. **Volume Consideration**: A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors, while a parallelepiped&#x27;s volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its defining vectors. However, volume alone does not guarantee fitting one inside the other due to size constraints.
   
2. **Size and Shape Constraints**: A tetrahedron with a large volume or specific dimensions (e.g., long edge lengths) might not fit inside a parallelepiped with smaller dimensions. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of a parallelepiped cannot fit, regardless of rotation or translation.

3. **Rigid Transformations**: The problem implies placing the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped using only rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling. If a tetrahedron is too large in any dimension, it cannot fit inside a smaller parallelepiped even after rotation.

4. **Counterexamples**: Specific examples, such as a tetrahedron with a volume larger than the maximum volume that can fit inside a unit cube (which is \( \frac{1}{3} \)), demonstrate that it is not always possible to fit any tetrahedron inside any parallelepiped.

Given these considerations, it is concluded that there exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped due to size constraints. Therefore, the answer is:

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped are. A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, right? And a parallelepiped is like a 3D figure formed by six parallelograms. Now, the problem mentions &quot;good&quot; tetrahedron and &quot;good&quot; parallelepiped. I wonder what makes them &quot;good&quot;? Maybe they have some specific properties? Let me check.

Wait, maybe &quot;good&quot; here means that the tetrahedron is non-degenerate, so it has a positive volume, and similarly, the parallelepiped is non-degenerate with all edges contributing to a positive volume. That makes sense. So, a good tetrahedron is one where the four vertices aren&#x27;t all coplanar, and a good parallelepiped is one where the three vectors defining it aren&#x27;t coplanar either. So, both have positive volume. Alright.

So, the question is: Given any tetrahedron with positive volume, can it fit inside any parallelepiped with positive volume? Hmm. That seems a bit general. Maybe I need to think about the dimensions. A parallelepiped is determined by three vectors, and its volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of those vectors. A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is 1/6 of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors from one vertex. So, maybe there&#x27;s a relationship there?

But wait, the tetrahedron and the parallelepiped could have different orientations. Maybe the issue is whether, regardless of how the tetrahedron is shaped, as long as it&#x27;s non-degenerate, there exists a way to position it inside any non-degenerate parallelepiped. But that seems too broad. For example, if the parallelepiped is very small, how can a tetrahedron with a certain volume fit inside it?

Wait, but maybe the problem is about whether the tetrahedron can be scaled or something? But the question says &quot;placed inside,&quot; which I think means without scaling. So, the original tetrahedron has to fit inside the parallelepiped as is. But then, if the parallelepiped is smaller in some dimensions, the tetrahedron might not fit. So maybe the answer is no?

But the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, regardless of the sizes, can you always fit one into the other? That seems unlikely. For example, if the parallelepiped is very &quot;flat,&quot; meaning one of its dimensions is very small, while the tetrahedron is quite &quot;tall&quot; in that dimension, then you couldn&#x27;t fit the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe &quot;good&quot; implies some additional constraints? Maybe all edges of the parallelepiped are of length at least some value, and the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges are bounded? Hmm, the problem statement just says &quot;good,&quot; which the user probably defines as non-degenerate. So, assuming positive volume for both. Then, the answer would depend on whether any tetrahedron, regardless of its shape and size, can fit inside any parallelepiped, regardless of its shape and size. Which is not possible because of scaling issues.

But maybe the problem allows for rotation and translation of the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped? So, if you can rotate the tetrahedron appropriately, maybe it can fit even if the parallelepiped is not aligned with the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges. But still, if the parallelepiped is smaller in all dimensions than the tetrahedron&#x27;s corresponding dimensions, even after rotation, it might not fit.

Wait, but how do we define the &quot;dimensions&quot; of a tetrahedron? A tetrahedron doesn&#x27;t have obvious length, width, and height like a box. Its size is more related to its edge lengths or its volume. Similarly, the parallelepiped has three edge vectors, so its &quot;size&quot; in different directions is determined by those vectors.

Maybe the key here is that given any tetrahedron, you can scale the parallelepiped to contain it, but the problem states &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so you can&#x27;t choose the parallelepiped&#x27;s size. Wait, no, the question is whether any tetrahedron can be placed inside any parallelepiped. So, given any tetrahedron and any parallelepiped, both non-degenerate, can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped? That seems impossible because you could have a very large tetrahedron and a very small parallelepiped.

But wait, maybe &quot;any&quot; here is in terms of shape, not size? Like, regardless of the proportions, but assuming they can be scaled? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling. So, I think the answer is no. For example, imagine a tetrahedron with edge lengths all equal to 1 meter, and a parallelepiped that&#x27;s 1 centimeter in each dimension. Clearly, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit inside. So, unless scaling is allowed, which the problem doesn&#x27;t state, the answer should be no.

But wait, maybe the problem is in a mathematical sense, where we can have any size as long as they are non-degenerate. But mathematically, size matters. If the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped, it can&#x27;t fit. So, unless there is a way to compress or expand, which isn&#x27;t mentioned, the answer is no.

But maybe the problem is considering that both are in some normalized form? For example, volume-wise. If both have unit volume, can any tetrahedron fit inside any parallelepiped? That might be a different question. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify normalization.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different context where &quot;good&quot; implies some other conditions. Wait, the user just said &quot;good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;good parallelepiped.&quot; Maybe in the context where &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron is such that it can fit into a unit cube, and the parallelepiped is also unit? But I need to go back to the original problem statement.

The original problem is: &quot;Determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, with the definitions of &quot;good&quot; being non-degenerate. So, each has positive volume. So, the question is: Given any two such shapes (tetrahedron and parallelepiped), can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped?

This seems like it&#x27;s asking if for all tetrahedrons T and for all parallelepipeds P (all non-degenerate), T can be placed inside P. Which is not true. For example, take a very &quot;large&quot; tetrahedron and a very &quot;small&quot; parallelepiped. The tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, maybe the question is reversed: Can any parallelepiped contain any tetrahedron? But still, no, because of size constraints.

But maybe the problem is in terms of similarity or something else. Wait, perhaps in terms of proportions rather than absolute size. For instance, regardless of the tetrahedron&#x27;s shape, there exists a parallelepiped with the same shape (up to scaling) that can contain it. But the problem says &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so the parallelepiped is given, not chosen based on the tetrahedron.

Wait, maybe the problem is more about the geometric relations, like whether the tetrahedron can be embedded inside the parallelepiped through affine transformations. But affine transformations can scale, rotate, shear, etc. If you allow affine transformations, then any tetrahedron can be transformed into any other tetrahedron, but the problem is about placing inside a parallelepiped. If you can apply affine transformations to the tetrahedron, then you can certainly fit it inside any parallelepiped, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify if such transformations are allowed.

But the wording is &quot;placed inside,&quot; which usually in geometry problems means using rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling or shearing. So, if you can only translate and rotate the tetrahedron, then whether it can fit inside the parallelepiped depends on their relative sizes and shapes.

Therefore, if the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped in some dimension, even after rotation, it can&#x27;t fit. For example, suppose the parallelepiped is a very thin rectangular prism (close to a flat box), and the tetrahedron is a regular tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the thickness of the prism. Then, no matter how you rotate the tetrahedron, its projection along the prism&#x27;s shortest axis would exceed the prism&#x27;s dimension in that axis. Hence, it can&#x27;t fit.

Therefore, the answer should be no. However, maybe there&#x27;s a different way to think about it. Let me consider specific examples.

Take a unit cube as the parallelepiped. Can any tetrahedron with, say, volume greater than 1/6 fit inside it? Wait, the maximum volume of a tetrahedron inside a cube is 1/3 (achieved by a corner tetrahedron). So, if a tetrahedron has a volume larger than 1/3, it can&#x27;t fit inside the cube. But the cube is a specific case of a parallelepiped. So, if I have a tetrahedron with volume larger than 1/3, then it can&#x27;t fit inside a unit cube. Therefore, such a tetrahedron cannot be placed inside a unit cube, even though both are &quot;good&quot; (non-degenerate). Therefore, the answer is no.

But wait, the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, in this case, there exists a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped (both good) such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. Therefore, the answer is no.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that you can choose the orientation and position of the tetrahedron within the parallelepiped. But even so, if the tetrahedron is too large in some direction, it can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different setting where scaling is allowed, but the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling, so I think it&#x27;s not.

Wait, but the problem might be in a mathematical context where sizes are not considered, but only the combinatorial or topological aspects. But in standard geometry, size matters. So, unless specified otherwise, we have to consider size.

Therefore, based on the above reasoning, the answer should be no. However, let me verify once more.

Suppose we have a tetrahedron with a very long edge. Then, the minimal parallelepiped that can contain it must have at least one edge as long as the longest edge of the tetrahedron. If the given parallelepiped doesn&#x27;t have any edge as long as that, then the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Therefore, unless the parallelepiped is at least as large as the tetrahedron in all dimensions, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Since &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped includes ones that are smaller in some dimensions, the answer is no.

Therefore, the answer is no, it is not possible to place any good tetrahedron inside any good parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a different interpretation. Maybe the problem is in terms of combinatorial placement, like whether the vertices can be placed inside the parallelepiped regardless of the edges? But no, the tetrahedron is a solid, so all its points must be inside the parallelepiped.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about affine equivalence. But affine transformations can change the shape, but again, unless allowed, the answer remains no.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question. For example, since a tetrahedron can be decomposed into parallelepipeds or something? But that&#x27;s not standard.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that a tetrahedron can fit inside a parallelepiped if you can embed its vertices within the parallelepiped&#x27;s vertices, but that&#x27;s a different question. For example, a cube (a special case of a parallelepiped) can have a tetrahedron inscribed within it by connecting four of its vertices. But the problem is about any tetrahedron into any parallelepiped.

If we can use affine transformations, then we can map a tetrahedron into a parallelepiped, but the problem states &quot;placed inside,&quot; which might not allow for such transformations.

Alternatively, consider that a parallelepiped can be divided into six tetrahedrons, each of which is similar to the others? Wait, no, not necessarily. A cube can be divided into six square pyramids, but that&#x27;s different.

Wait, perhaps the answer is yes, and I&#x27;m missing something. Let me think again.

Suppose we have any tetrahedron. Let&#x27;s consider its minimum bounding box. A bounding box is a parallelepiped (specifically, a rectangular prism if aligned with axes). Then, if we can show that any parallelepiped can contain any such bounding box, then the tetrahedron can be placed inside. But that&#x27;s not true because the bounding box&#x27;s dimensions depend on the tetrahedron, and the given parallelepiped might not have the required dimensions.

Alternatively, maybe by rotating the tetrahedron, we can fit it into a smaller parallelepiped? For example, the minimal volume parallelepiped enclosing a tetrahedron can be found by rotating the tetrahedron such that its edges align with the parallelepiped&#x27;s vectors. However, the volume of the minimal enclosing parallelepiped would depend on the tetrahedron&#x27;s geometry.

But the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, which might have a different orientation and size. So, even if the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal enclosing parallelepiped is smaller, the given parallelepiped might not have the right orientation or size.

Wait, perhaps if the parallelepiped is scaled such that it can contain the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal bounding parallelepiped. But the problem doesn&#x27;t allow scaling the parallelepiped. The parallelepiped is given, and we need to fit the tetrahedron inside it as is.

Alternatively, if the given parallelepiped is larger in all directions than the minimal bounding parallelepiped of the tetrahedron, then it can fit. But since the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, including smaller ones, the answer remains no.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a way to fold the tetrahedron into the parallelepiped? But in three-dimensional geometry, folding isn&#x27;t possible without tearing, so that&#x27;s not applicable.

Alternatively, using some projection or something? I don&#x27;t think so. To place a tetrahedron inside a parallelepiped, all its vertices must lie within the parallelepiped, and the edges must connect those vertices inside the parallelepiped. But if the parallelepiped is too small in some direction, the tetrahedron&#x27;s vertex coordinates would exceed the parallelepiped&#x27;s bounds in that direction.

Therefore, considering all this, the answer should be no. There exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of the parallelepiped cannot fit.

But maybe the problem uses &quot;good&quot; in a different way. Maybe a good tetrahedron is one that is contained within a unit cube, and a good parallelepiped is one that contains a unit cube? Then, perhaps any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. But that&#x27;s speculative. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Alternatively, if &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron has edges no longer than the edges of the parallelepiped. But again, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Therefore, given the problem as stated, with &quot;good&quot; meaning non-degenerate (positive volume), the answer is no. Because you can always find a tetrahedron too large to fit into a given parallelepiped, and a parallelepiped too small to contain a given tetrahedron.

Thus, the conclusion is that it&#x27;s not possible for any good tetrahedron to be placed inside any good parallelepiped. So, the answer is no.

\boxed{No}

To determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped, we need to consider the definitions of &quot;good&quot; as non-degenerate, meaning both have positive volume.

That makes sense. So, a good tetrahedron is one where the four vertices aren&#x27;t all coplanar, and a good parallelepiped is one where the three vectors defining it aren&#x27;t coplanar either. So, both have positive volume. Alright.

A parallelepiped is determined by three vectors, and its volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of those vectors. A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is 1/6 of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors from one vertex. So, maybe there&#x27;s a relationship there?

But wait, the tetrahedron and the parallelepiped could have different orientations. Maybe the issue is whether, regardless of how the tetrahedron is shaped, as long as it&#x27;s non-degenerate, there exists a way to position it inside any non-degenerate parallelepiped. But that seems too broad. For example, if the parallelepiped is very small, how can a tetrahedron with a certain volume fit inside it?

Wait, but maybe the problem is about whether the tetrahedron can be scaled or something? But the question says &quot;placed inside,&quot; which I think means without scaling. So, the original tetrahedron has to fit inside the parallelepiped as is. But then, if the parallelepiped is smaller in some dimensions, the tetrahedron might not fit. So maybe the answer is no?

But the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, regardless of the sizes, can you always fit one into the other? That seems unlikely. For example, if the parallelepiped is very &quot;flat,&quot; meaning one of its dimensions is very small, while the tetrahedron is quite &quot;tall&quot; in that dimension, then you couldn&#x27;t fit the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe &quot;good&quot; implies some additional constraints? Maybe all edges of the parallelepiped are of length at least some value, and the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges are bounded? Hmm, the problem statement just says &quot;good,&quot; which the user probably defines as non-degenerate. So, assuming positive volume for both. Then, the answer would depend on whether any tetrahedron, regardless of its shape and size, can fit inside any parallelepiped, regardless of its shape and size. Which is not possible because of scaling issues.

But maybe the problem allows for rotation and translation of the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped? So, if you can rotate the tetrahedron appropriately, maybe it can fit even if the parallelepiped is not aligned with the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges. But still, if the parallelepiped is smaller in all dimensions than the tetrahedron&#x27;s corresponding dimensions, even after rotation, it might not fit.

Wait, but how do we define the &quot;dimensions&quot; of a tetrahedron? A tetrahedron doesn&#x27;t have obvious length, width, and height like a box. Its size is more related to its edge lengths or its volume. Similarly, the parallelepiped has three edge vectors, so its &quot;size&quot; in different directions is determined by those vectors.

Maybe the key here is that given any tetrahedron, you can scale the parallelepiped to contain it, but the problem states &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so you can&#x27;t choose the parallelepiped&#x27;s size. Wait, no, the question is whether any tetrahedron can be placed inside any parallelepiped. So, given any tetrahedron and any parallelepiped, both non-degenerate, can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped? That seems impossible because you could have a very large tetrahedron and a very small parallelepiped.

But wait, maybe &quot;any&quot; here is in terms of shape, not size? Like, regardless of the proportions, but assuming they can be scaled? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling. So, I think the answer is no. For example, imagine a tetrahedron with edge lengths all equal to 1 meter, and a parallelepiped that&#x27;s 1 centimeter in each dimension. Clearly, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit inside. So, unless scaling is allowed, which the problem doesn&#x27;t state, the answer should be no.

But wait, maybe the problem is in a mathematical sense, where we can have any size as long as they are non-degenerate. But mathematically, size matters. If the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped, it can&#x27;t fit. So, unless there is a way to compress or expand, which isn&#x27;t mentioned, the answer is no.

But maybe the problem is considering that both are in some normalized form? For example, volume-wise. If both have unit volume, can any tetrahedron fit inside any parallelepiped? That might be a different question. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify normalization.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different context where &quot;good&quot; implies some other conditions. Wait, the user just said &quot;good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;good parallelepiped.&quot; Maybe in the context where &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron is such that it can fit into a unit cube, and the parallelepiped is also unit? But I need to go back to the original problem statement.

The original problem is: &quot;Determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, with the definitions of &quot;good&quot; being non-degenerate. So, each has positive volume. So, the question is: Given any two such shapes (tetrahedron and parallelepiped), can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped?

This seems like it&#x27;s asking if for all tetrahedrons T and for all parallelepipeds P (all non-degenerate), T can be placed inside P. Which is not true. For example, take a very &quot;large&quot; tetrahedron and a very &quot;small&quot; parallelepiped. The tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, maybe the question is reversed: Can any parallelepiped contain any tetrahedron? But still, no, because of size constraints.

But maybe the problem is in terms of similarity or something else. Wait, perhaps in terms of proportions rather than absolute size. For instance, regardless of the tetrahedron&#x27;s shape, there exists a parallelepiped with the same shape (up to scaling) that can contain it. But the problem says &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so the parallelepiped is given, not chosen based on the tetrahedron.

Wait, maybe the problem is more about the geometric relations, like whether the tetrahedron can be embedded inside the parallelepiped through affine transformations. But affine transformations can scale, rotate, shear, etc. If you allow affine transformations, then any tetrahedron can be transformed into any other tetrahedron, but the problem is about placing inside a parallelepiped. If you can apply affine transformations to the tetrahedron, then you can certainly fit it inside any parallelepiped, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify if such transformations are allowed.

But the wording is &quot;placed inside,&quot; which usually in geometry problems means using rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling or shearing. So, if you can only translate and rotate the tetrahedron, then whether it can fit inside the parallelepiped depends on their relative sizes and shapes.

Therefore, if the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped in some dimension, even after rotation, it can&#x27;t fit. For example, suppose the parallelepiped is a very thin rectangular prism (close to a flat box), and the tetrahedron is a regular tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the thickness of the prism. Then, no matter how you rotate the tetrahedron, its projection along the prism&#x27;s shortest axis would exceed the prism&#x27;s dimension in that axis. Hence, it can&#x27;t fit.

Therefore, the answer should be no. However, maybe there&#x27;s a different way to think about it. Let me consider specific examples.

Take a unit cube as the parallelepiped. Can any tetrahedron with, say, volume greater than 1/6 fit inside it? Wait, the maximum volume of a tetrahedron inside a cube is 1/3 (achieved by a corner tetrahedron). So, if a tetrahedron has a volume larger than 1/3, it can&#x27;t fit inside the cube. But the cube is a specific case of a parallelepiped. So, if I have a tetrahedron with volume larger than 1/3, then it can&#x27;t fit inside a unit cube. Therefore, such a tetrahedron cannot be placed inside a unit cube, even though both are &quot;good&quot; (non-degenerate). Therefore, the answer is no.

But wait, the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, in this case, there exists a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped (both good) such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. Therefore, the answer is no.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that you can choose the orientation and position of the tetrahedron within the parallelepiped. But even so, if the tetrahedron is too large in some direction, it can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different setting where scaling is allowed, but the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling, so I think it&#x27;s not.

Wait, but the problem might be in a mathematical context where sizes are not considered, but only the combinatorial or topological aspects. But in standard geometry, size matters. So, unless specified otherwise, we have to consider size.

Therefore, based on the above reasoning, the answer should be no. However, let me verify once more.

Suppose we have a tetrahedron with a very long edge. Then, the minimal parallelepiped that can contain it must have at least one edge as long as the longest edge of the tetrahedron. If the given parallelepiped doesn&#x27;t have any edge as long as that, then the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Therefore, unless the parallelepiped is at least as large as the tetrahedron in all dimensions, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Since &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped includes ones that are smaller in some dimensions, the answer is no.

Therefore, the answer is no, it is not possible to place any good tetrahedron inside any good parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a different interpretation. Maybe the problem is in terms of combinatorial placement, like whether the vertices can be placed inside the parallelepiped regardless of the edges? But no, the tetrahedron is a solid, so all its points must be inside the parallelepiped.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about affine equivalence. But affine transformations can change the shape, but again, unless allowed, the answer remains no.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question. For example, since a tetrahedron can be decomposed into parallelepipeds or something? But that&#x27;s not standard.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that a tetrahedron can fit inside a parallelepiped if you can embed its vertices within the parallelepiped&#x27;s vertices, but that&#x27;s a different question. For example, a cube (a special case of a parallelepiped) can have a tetrahedron inscribed within it by connecting four of its vertices. But the problem is about any tetrahedron into any parallelepiped.

Wait, perhaps the key is that any tetrahedron can be affinely transformed into any other tetrahedron, but here we are dealing with a parallelepiped. If we can use affine transformations, then we can map a tetrahedron into a parallelepiped, but the problem states &quot;placed inside,&quot; which might not allow for such transformations.

Alternatively, consider that a parallelepiped can be divided into six tetrahedrons, each of which is similar to the others? Wait, no, not necessarily. A cube can be divided into six square pyramids, but that&#x27;s different.

Wait, perhaps the answer is yes, and I&#x27;m missing something. Let me think again.

Suppose we have any tetrahedron. Let&#x27;s consider its minimum bounding box. A bounding box is a parallelepiped (specifically, a rectangular prism if aligned with axes). Then, if we can show that any parallelepiped can contain any such bounding box, then the tetrahedron can be placed inside. But that&#x27;s not true because the bounding box&#x27;s dimensions depend on the tetrahedron, and the given parallelepiped might not have the required dimensions.

Alternatively, maybe by rotating the tetrahedron, we can fit it into a smaller parallelepiped? For example, the minimal volume parallelepiped enclosing a tetrahedron can be found by rotating the tetrahedron such that its edges align with the parallelepiped&#x27;s vectors. However, the volume of the minimal enclosing parallelepiped would depend on the tetrahedron&#x27;s geometry.

But the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, which might have a different orientation and size. So, even if the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal enclosing parallelepiped is smaller, the given parallelepiped might not have the right orientation or size.

Wait, perhaps if the parallelepiped is scaled such that it can contain the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal bounding parallelepiped. But the problem doesn&#x27;t allow scaling the parallelepiped. The parallelepiped is given, and we need to fit the tetrahedron inside it as is.

Alternatively, if the given parallelepiped is larger in all directions than the minimal bounding parallelepiped of the tetrahedron, then it can fit. But since the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, including smaller ones, the answer remains no.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a way to fold the tetrahedron into the parallelepiped? But in three-dimensional geometry, folding isn&#x27;t possible without tearing, so that&#x27;s not applicable.

Alternatively, using some projection or something? I don&#x27;t think so. To place a tetrahedron inside a parallelepiped, all its vertices must lie within the parallelepiped, and the edges must connect those vertices inside the parallelepiped. But if the parallelepiped is too small in some direction, the tetrahedron&#x27;s vertex coordinates would exceed the parallelepiped&#x27;s bounds in that direction.

Therefore, considering all this, the answer should be no. There exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of the parallelepiped cannot fit.

But maybe the problem uses &quot;good&quot; in a different way. Maybe a good tetrahedron is one that is contained within a unit cube, and a good parallelepiped is one that contains a unit cube? Then, perhaps any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. But that&#x27;s speculative. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Alternatively, if &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron has edges no longer than the edges of the parallelepiped. But again, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Therefore, given the problem as stated, with &quot;good&quot; meaning non-degenerate (positive volume), the answer is no. Because you can always find a tetrahedron too large to fit into a given parallelepiped, and a parallelepiped too small to contain a given tetrahedron.

Thus, the conclusion is that it&#x27;s not possible for any good tetrahedron to be placed inside any good parallelepiped. So, the answer is no.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped, we need to consider the definitions of &quot;good&quot; as non-degenerate, meaning both have positive volume. 

A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, and a parallelepiped is a three-dimensional figure formed by six parallelograms. The key points considered are:

1. **Volume Consideration**: A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors, while a parallelepiped&#x27;s volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its defining vectors. However, volume alone does not guarantee fitting one inside the other due to size constraints.
   
2. **Size and Shape Constraints**: A tetrahedron with a large volume or specific dimensions (e.g., long edge lengths) might not fit inside a parallelepiped with smaller dimensions. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of a parallelepiped cannot fit, regardless of rotation or translation.

3. **Rigid Transformations**: The problem implies placing the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped using only rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling. If a tetrahedron is too large in any dimension, it cannot fit inside a smaller parallelepiped even after rotation.

4. **Counterexamples**: Specific examples, such as a tetrahedron with a volume larger than the maximum volume that can fit inside a unit cube (which is \( \frac{1}{3} \)), demonstrate that it is not always possible to fit any tetrahedron inside any parallelepiped.

Given these considerations, it is concluded that there exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped due to size constraints. Therefore, the answer is:

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped are. A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, right? And a parallelepiped is like a 3D figure formed by six parallelograms. Now, the problem mentions &quot;good&quot; tetrahedron and &quot;good&quot; parallelepiped. I wonder what makes them &quot;good&quot;? Maybe they have some specific properties? Let me check.

Wait, maybe &quot;good&quot; here means that the tetrahedron is non-degenerate, so it has a positive volume, and similarly, the parallelepiped is non-degenerate with all edges contributing to a positive volume. That makes sense. So, a good tetrahedron is one where the four vertices aren&#x27;t all coplanar, and a good parallelepiped is one where the three vectors defining it aren&#x27;t coplanar either. So, both have positive volume. Alright.

So, the question is: Given any tetrahedron with positive volume, can it fit inside any parallelepiped with positive volume? Hmm. That seems a bit general. Maybe I need to think about the dimensions. A parallelepiped is determined by three vectors, and its volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of those vectors. A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is 1/6 of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors from one vertex. So, maybe there&#x27;s a relationship there?

But wait, the tetrahedron and the parallelepiped could have different orientations. Maybe the issue is whether, regardless of how the tetrahedron is shaped, as long as it&#x27;s non-degenerate, there exists a way to position it inside any non-degenerate parallelepiped. But that seems too broad. For example, if the parallelepiped is very small, how can a tetrahedron with a certain volume fit inside it?

Wait, but maybe the problem is about whether the tetrahedron can be scaled or something? But the question says &quot;placed inside,&quot; which I think means without scaling. So, the original tetrahedron has to fit inside the parallelepiped as is. But then, if the parallelepiped is smaller in some dimensions, the tetrahedron might not fit. So maybe the answer is no?

But the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, regardless of the sizes, can you always fit one into the other? That seems unlikely. For example, if the parallelepiped is very &quot;flat,&quot; meaning one of its dimensions is very small, while the tetrahedron is quite &quot;tall&quot; in that dimension, then you couldn&#x27;t fit the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe &quot;good&quot; implies some additional constraints? Maybe all edges of the parallelepiped are of length at least some value, and the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges are bounded? Hmm, the problem statement just says &quot;good,&quot; which the user probably defines as non-degenerate. So, assuming positive volume for both. Then, the answer would depend on whether any tetrahedron, regardless of its shape and size, can fit inside any parallelepiped, regardless of its shape and size. Which is not possible because of scaling issues.

But maybe the problem allows for rotation and translation of the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped? So, if you can rotate the tetrahedron appropriately, maybe it can fit even if the parallelepiped is not aligned with the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges. But still, if the parallelepiped is smaller in all dimensions than the tetrahedron&#x27;s corresponding dimensions, even after rotation, it might not fit.

Wait, but how do we define the &quot;dimensions&quot; of a tetrahedron? A tetrahedron doesn&#x27;t have obvious length, width, and height like a box. Its size is more related to its edge lengths or its volume. Similarly, the parallelepiped has three edge vectors, so its &quot;size&quot; in different directions is determined by those vectors.

Maybe the key here is that given any tetrahedron, you can scale the parallelepiped to contain it, but the problem states &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so you can&#x27;t choose the parallelepiped&#x27;s size. Wait, no, the question is whether any tetrahedron can be placed inside any parallelepiped. So, given any tetrahedron and any parallelepiped, both non-degenerate, can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped? That seems impossible because you could have a very large tetrahedron and a very small parallelepiped.

But wait, maybe &quot;any&quot; here is in terms of shape, not size? Like, regardless of the proportions, but assuming they can be scaled? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling. So, I think the answer is no. For example, imagine a tetrahedron with edge lengths all equal to 1 meter, and a parallelepiped that&#x27;s 1 centimeter in each dimension. Clearly, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit inside. So, unless scaling is allowed, which the problem doesn&#x27;t state, the answer should be no.

But wait, maybe the problem is in a mathematical sense, where we can have any size as long as they are non-degenerate. But mathematically, size matters. If the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped, it can&#x27;t fit. So, unless there is a way to compress or expand, which isn&#x27;t mentioned, the answer is no.

But maybe the problem is considering that both are in some normalized form? For example, volume-wise. If both have unit volume, can any tetrahedron fit inside any parallelepiped? That might be a different question. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify normalization.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different context where &quot;good&quot; implies some other conditions. Wait, the user just said &quot;good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;good parallelepiped.&quot; Maybe in the context where &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron is such that it can fit into a unit cube, and the parallelepiped is also unit? But I need to go back to the original problem statement.

The original problem is: &quot;Determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, with the definitions of &quot;good&quot; being non-degenerate. So, each has positive volume. So, the question is: Given any two such shapes (tetrahedron and parallelepiped), can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped?

This seems like it&#x27;s asking if for all tetrahedrons T and for all parallelepipeds P (all non-degenerate), T can be placed inside P. Which is not true. For example, take a very &quot;large&quot; tetrahedron and a very &quot;small&quot; parallelepiped. The tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, maybe the question is reversed: Can any parallelepiped contain any tetrahedron? But still, no, because of size constraints.

But maybe the problem is in terms of similarity or something else. Wait, perhaps in terms of proportions rather than absolute size. For instance, regardless of the tetrahedron&#x27;s shape, there exists a parallelepiped with the same shape (up to scaling) that can contain it. But the problem says &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so the parallelepiped is given, not chosen based on the tetrahedron.

Wait, maybe the problem is more about the geometric relations, like whether the tetrahedron can be embedded inside the parallelepiped through affine transformations. But affine transformations can scale, rotate, shear, etc. If you allow affine transformations, then any tetrahedron can be transformed into any other tetrahedron, but the problem is about placing inside a parallelepiped.

Then, no matter how you rotate the tetrahedron, its projection along the prism&#x27;s shortest axis would exceed the prism&#x27;s dimension in that axis. Hence, it can&#x27;t fit.

Therefore, the answer should be no. However, maybe there&#x27;s a different way to think about it. Let me consider specific examples.

Take a unit cube as the parallelepiped. Can any tetrahedron with, say, volume greater than 1/6 fit inside it? Wait, the maximum volume of a tetrahedron inside a cube is 1/3 (achieved by a corner tetrahedron). So, if a tetrahedron has a volume larger than 1/3, it can&#x27;t fit inside the cube. But the cube is a specific case of a parallelepiped. So, if I have a tetrahedron with volume larger than 1/3, then it can&#x27;t fit inside a unit cube. Therefore, such a tetrahedron cannot be placed inside a unit cube, even though both are &quot;good&quot; (non-degenerate). Therefore, the answer is no.

But wait, the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, in this case, there exists a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped (both good) such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. Therefore, the answer is no.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that you can choose the orientation and position of the tetrahedron within the parallelepiped. But even so, if the tetrahedron is too large in some direction, it can&#x27;t fit.

Since &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped includes ones that are smaller in some dimensions, the answer is no.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about affine equivalence. But affine transformations can change the shape, but again, unless allowed, the answer remains no.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question. For example, since a tetrahedron can be decomposed into parallelepipeds or something? But that&#x27;s not standard.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that a tetrahedron can fit inside a parallelepiped if you can embed its vertices within the parallelepiped&#x27;s vertices, but that&#x27;s a different question.

If we can use affine transformations, then we can map a tetrahedron into a parallelepiped, but the problem states &quot;placed inside,&quot; which might not allow for such transformations.

Alternatively, consider that a parallelepiped can be divided into six tetrahedrons, each of which is similar to the others? Wait, no, not necessarily. A cube can be divided into six square pyramids, but that&#x27;s different.

Wait, perhaps the answer is yes, and I&#x27;m missing something. Let me think again.

Suppose we have any tetrahedron. Let&#x27;s consider its minimum bounding box. A bounding box is a parallelepiped (specifically, a rectangular prism if aligned with axes). Then, if we can show that any parallelepiped can contain any such bounding box, then the tetrahedron can be placed inside. But that&#x27;s not true because the bounding box&#x27;s dimensions depend on the tetrahedron, and the given parallelepiped might not have the required dimensions.

Alternatively, maybe by rotating the tetrahedron, we can fit it into a smaller parallelepiped? For example, the minimal volume parallelepiped enclosing a tetrahedron can be found by rotating the tetrahedron such that its edges align with the parallelepiped&#x27;s vectors. However, the volume of the minimal enclosing parallelepiped would depend on the tetrahedron&#x27;s geometry.

But the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, which might have a different orientation and size. So, even if the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal enclosing parallelepiped is smaller, the given parallelepiped might not have the right orientation or size.

Wait, perhaps if the parallelepiped is scaled such that it can contain the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal bounding parallelepiped. But the problem doesn&#x27;t allow scaling the parallelepiped. The parallelepiped is given, and we need to fit the tetrahedron inside it as is.

Alternatively, if the given parallelepiped is larger in all directions than the minimal bounding parallelepiped of the tetrahedron, then it can fit. But since the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, including smaller ones, the answer remains no.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a way to fold the tetrahedron into the parallelepiped? But in three-dimensional geometry, folding isn&#x27;t possible without tearing, so that&#x27;s not applicable.

Alternatively, using some projection or something? I don&#x27;t think so. To place a tetrahedron inside a parallelepiped, all its vertices must lie within the parallelepiped, and the edges must connect those vertices inside the parallelepiped. But if the parallelepiped is too small in some direction, the tetrahedron&#x27;s vertex coordinates would exceed the parallelepiped&#x27;s bounds in that direction.

Therefore, considering all this, the answer should be no. There exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of the parallelepiped cannot fit.

But maybe the problem uses &quot;good&quot; in a different way. Maybe a good tetrahedron is one that is contained within a unit cube, and a good parallelepiped is one that contains a unit cube? Then, perhaps any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. But that&#x27;s speculative. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Alternatively, if &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron has edges no longer than the edges of the parallelepiped. But again, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Therefore, given the problem as stated, with &quot;good&quot; meaning non-degenerate (positive volume), the answer is no. Because you can always find a tetrahedron too large to fit into a given parallelepiped, and a parallelepiped too small to contain a given tetrahedron.

Thus, the conclusion is that it&#x27;s not possible for any good tetrahedron to be placed inside any good parallelepiped. So, the answer is no.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped, we need to consider the definitions of &quot;good&quot; as non-degenerate, meaning both have positive volume. 

A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, and a parallelepiped is a three-dimensional figure formed by six parallelograms. The key points considered are:

1. **Volume Consideration**: A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors, while a parallelepiped&#x27;s volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its defining vectors. However, volume alone does not guarantee fitting one inside the other due to size constraints.
   
2. **Size and Shape Constraints**: A tetrahedron with a large volume or specific dimensions (e.g., long edge lengths) might not fit inside a parallelepiped with smaller dimensions. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of a parallelepiped cannot fit, regardless of rotation or translation.

3. **Rigid Transformations**: The problem implies placing the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped using only rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling. If a tetrahedron is too large in any dimension, it cannot fit inside a smaller parallelepiped even after rotation.

4. **Counterexamples**: Specific examples, such as a tetrahedron with a volume larger than the maximum volume that can fit inside a unit cube (which is \( \frac{1}{3} \)), demonstrate that it is not always possible to fit any tetrahedron inside any parallelepiped.

Given these considerations, it is concluded that there exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped due to size constraints. Therefore, the answer is:

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped are. A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, right? And a parallelepiped is like a 3D figure formed by six parallelograms. Now, the problem mentions &quot;good&quot; tetrahedron and &quot;good&quot; parallelepiped. I wonder what makes them &quot;good&quot;? Maybe they have some specific properties? Let me check.

Wait, maybe &quot;good&quot; here means that the tetrahedron is non-degenerate, so it has a positive volume, and similarly, the parallelepiped is non-degenerate with all edges contributing to a positive volume. That makes sense. So, a good tetrahedron is one where the four vertices aren&#x27;t all coplanar, and a good parallelepiped is one where the three vectors defining it aren&#x27;t coplanar either. So, both have positive volume. Alright.

So, the question is: Given any tetrahedron with positive volume, can it fit inside any parallelepiped with positive volume? Hmm. That seems a bit general. Maybe I need to think about the dimensions. A parallelepiped is determined by three vectors, and its volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of those vectors. A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is 1/6 of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors from one vertex. So, maybe there&#x27;s a relationship there?

But wait, the tetrahedron and the parallelepiped could have different orientations. Maybe the issue is whether, regardless of how the tetrahedron is shaped, as long as it&#x27;s non-degenerate, there exists a way to position it inside any non-degenerate parallelepiped. But that seems too broad. For example, if the parallelepiped is very small, how can a tetrahedron with a certain volume fit inside it?

Wait, but maybe the problem is about whether the tetrahedron can be scaled or something? But the question says &quot;placed inside,&quot; which I think means without scaling. So, the original tetrahedron has to fit inside the parallelepiped as is. But then, if the parallelepiped is smaller in some dimensions, the tetrahedron might not fit. So maybe the answer is no?

But the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, regardless of the sizes, can you always fit one into the other? That seems unlikely. For example, if the parallelepiped is very &quot;flat,&quot; meaning one of its dimensions is very small, while the tetrahedron is quite &quot;tall&quot; in that dimension, then you couldn&#x27;t fit the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe &quot;good&quot; implies some additional constraints? Maybe all edges of the parallelepiped are of length at least some value, and the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges are bounded? Hmm, the problem statement just says &quot;good,&quot; which the user probably defines as non-degenerate. So, assuming positive volume for both. Then, the answer would depend on whether any tetrahedron, regardless of its shape and size, can fit inside any parallelepiped, regardless of its shape and size. Which is not possible because of scaling issues.

But maybe the problem allows for rotation and translation of the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped? So, if you can rotate the tetrahedron appropriately, maybe it can fit even if the parallelepiped is not aligned with the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges. But still, if the parallelepiped is smaller in all dimensions than the tetrahedron&#x27;s corresponding dimensions, even after rotation, it might not fit.

Wait, but how do we define the &quot;dimensions&quot; of a tetrahedron? A tetrahedron doesn&#x27;t have obvious length, width, and height like a box. Its size is more related to its edge lengths or its volume. Similarly, the parallelepiped has three edge vectors, so its &quot;size&quot; in different directions is determined by those vectors.

Maybe the key here is that given any tetrahedron, you can scale the parallelepiped to contain it, but the problem states &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so you can&#x27;t choose the parallelepiped&#x27;s size. Wait, no, the question is whether any tetrahedron can be placed inside any parallelepiped. So, given any tetrahedron and any parallelepiped, both non-degenerate, can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped? That seems impossible because you could have a very large tetrahedron and a very small parallelepiped.

But wait, maybe &quot;any&quot; here is in terms of shape, not size? Like, regardless of the proportions, but assuming they can be scaled? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling. So, I think the answer is no. For example, imagine a tetrahedron with edge lengths all equal to 1 meter, and a parallelepiped that&#x27;s 1 centimeter in each dimension. Clearly, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit inside. So, unless scaling is allowed, which the problem doesn&#x27;t state, the answer should be no.

But wait, maybe the problem is in a mathematical sense, where we can have any size as long as they are non-degenerate. But mathematically, size matters. If the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped, it can&#x27;t fit. So, unless there is a way to compress or expand, which isn&#x27;t mentioned, the answer is no.

But maybe the problem is considering that both are in some normalized form? For example, volume-wise. If both have unit volume, can any tetrahedron fit inside any parallelepiped? That might be a different question. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify normalization.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different context where &quot;good&quot; implies some other conditions. Wait, the user just said &quot;good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;good parallelepiped.&quot; Maybe in the context where &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron is such that it can fit into a unit cube, and the parallelepiped is also unit? But I need to go back to the original problem statement.

The original problem is: &quot;Determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, with the definitions of &quot;good&quot; being non-degenerate. So, each has positive volume. So, the question is: Given any two such shapes (tetrahedron and parallelepiped), can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped?

This seems like it&#x27;s asking if for all tetrahedrons T and for all parallelepipeds P (all non-degenerate), T can be placed inside P. Which is not true. For example, take a very &quot;large&quot; tetrahedron and a very &quot;small&quot; parallelepiped. The tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, maybe the question is reversed: Can any parallelepiped contain any tetrahedron? But still, no, because of size constraints.

But maybe the problem is in terms of similarity or something else. Wait, perhaps in terms of proportions rather than absolute size. For instance, regardless of the tetrahedron&#x27;s shape, there exists a parallelepiped with the same shape (up to scaling) that can contain it. But the problem says &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so the parallelepiped is given, not chosen based on the tetrahedron.

Wait, maybe the problem is more about the geometric relations, like whether the tetrahedron can be embedded inside the parallelepiped through affine transformations. But affine transformations can scale, rotate, shear, etc. If you allow affine transformations, then any tetrahedron can be transformed into any other tetrahedron, but the problem is about placing inside a parallelepiped. If you can apply affine transformations to the tetrahedron, then you can certainly fit it inside any parallelepiped, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify if such transformations are allowed.

But the wording is &quot;placed inside,&quot; which usually in geometry problems means using rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling or shearing. So, if you can only translate and rotate the tetrahedron, then whether it can fit inside the parallelepiped depends on their relative sizes and shapes.

Therefore, if the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped in some dimension, even after rotation, it can&#x27;t fit. For example, suppose the parallelepiped is a very thin rectangular prism (close to a flat box), and the tetrahedron is a regular tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the thickness of the prism. Then, no matter how you rotate the tetrahedron, its projection along the prism&#x27;s shortest axis would exceed the prism&#x27;s dimension in that axis. Hence, it can&#x27;t fit.

Therefore, the answer should be no. However, maybe there&#x27;s a different way to think about it. Let me consider specific examples.

Take a unit cube as the parallelepiped. Can any tetrahedron with, say, volume greater than 1/6 fit inside it? Wait, the maximum volume of a tetrahedron inside a cube is 1/3 (achieved by a corner tetrahedron). So, if a tetrahedron has a volume larger than 1/3, it can&#x27;t fit inside the cube. But the cube is a specific case of a parallelepiped. So, if I have a tetrahedron with volume larger than 1/3, then it can&#x27;t fit inside a unit cube. Therefore, such a tetrahedron cannot be placed inside a unit cube, even though both are &quot;good&quot; (non-degenerate). Therefore, the answer is no.

But wait, the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, in this case, there exists a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped (both good) such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. Therefore, the answer is no.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that you can choose the orientation and position of the tetrahedron within the parallelepiped. But even so, if the tetrahedron is too large in some direction, it can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different setting where scaling is allowed, but the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling, so I think it&#x27;s not.

Wait, but the problem might be in a mathematical context where sizes are not considered, but only the combinatorial or topological aspects. But in standard geometry, size matters. So, unless specified otherwise, we have to consider size.

Therefore, based on the above reasoning, the answer should be no. However, let me verify once more.

Suppose we have a tetrahedron with a very long edge. Then, the minimal parallelepiped that can contain it must have at least one edge as long as the longest edge of the tetrahedron. If the given parallelepiped doesn&#x27;t have any edge as long as that, then the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Therefore, unless the parallelepiped is at least as large as the tetrahedron in all dimensions, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Since &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped includes ones that are smaller in some dimensions, the answer is no.

Therefore, the answer is no, it is not possible to place any good tetrahedron inside any good parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a different interpretation. Maybe the problem is in terms of combinatorial placement, like whether the vertices can be placed inside the parallelepiped regardless of the edges? But no, the tetrahedron is a solid, so all its points must be inside the parallelepiped.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about affine equivalence. But affine transformations can change the shape, but again, unless allowed, the answer remains no.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question. For example, since a tetrahedron can be decomposed into parallelepipeds or something? But that&#x27;s not standard.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that a tetrahedron can fit inside a parallelepiped if you can embed its vertices within the parallelepiped&#x27;s vertices, but that&#x27;s a different question. For example, a cube (a special case of a parallelepiped) can have a tetrahedron inscribed within it by connecting four of its vertices. But the problem is about any tetrahedron into any parallelepiped.

Wait, perhaps the key is that any tetrahedron can be affinely transformed into any other tetrahedron, but here we are dealing with a parallelepiped. If we can use affine transformations, then we can map a tetrahedron into a parallelepiped, but the problem states &quot;placed inside,&quot; which might not allow for such transformations.

Alternatively, consider that a parallelepiped can be divided into six tetrahedrons, each of which is similar to the others? Wait, no, not necessarily. A cube can be divided into six square pyramids, but that&#x27;s different.

Wait, perhaps the answer is yes, and I&#x27;m missing something. Let me think again.

Suppose we have any tetrahedron. Let&#x27;s consider its minimum bounding box. A bounding box is a parallelepiped (specifically, a rectangular prism if aligned with axes). Then, if we can show that any parallelepiped can contain any such bounding box, then the tetrahedron can be placed inside. But that&#x27;s not true because the bounding box&#x27;s dimensions depend on the tetrahedron, and the given parallelepiped might not have the required dimensions.

Alternatively, maybe by rotating the tetrahedron, we can fit it into a smaller parallelepiped? For example, the minimal volume parallelepiped enclosing a tetrahedron can be found by rotating the tetrahedron such that its edges align with the parallelepiped&#x27;s vectors. However, the volume of the minimal enclosing parallelepiped would depend on the tetrahedron&#x27;s geometry.

But the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, which might have a different orientation and size. So, even if the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal enclosing parallelepiped is smaller, the given parallelepiped might not have the right orientation or size.

Wait, perhaps if the parallelepiped is scaled such that it can contain the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal bounding parallelepiped. But the problem doesn&#x27;t allow scaling the parallelepiped. The parallelepiped is given, and we need to fit the tetrahedron inside it as is.

Alternatively, if the given parallelepiped is larger in all directions than the minimal bounding parallelepiped of the tetrahedron, then it can fit. But since the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, including smaller ones, the answer remains no.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a way to fold the tetrahedron into the parallelepiped? But in three-dimensional geometry, folding isn&#x27;t possible without tearing, so that&#x27;s not applicable.

Alternatively, using some projection or something? I don&#x27;t think so. To place a tetrahedron inside a parallelepiped, all its vertices must lie within the parallelepiped, and the edges must connect those vertices inside the parallelepiped. But if the parallelepiped is too small in some direction, the tetrahedron&#x27;s vertex coordinates would exceed the parallelepiped&#x27;s bounds in that direction.

Therefore, considering all this, the answer should be no. There exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of the parallelepiped cannot fit.

But maybe the problem uses &quot;good&quot; in a different way. Maybe a good tetrahedron is one that is contained within a unit cube, and a good parallelepiped is one that contains a unit cube? Then, perhaps any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. But that&#x27;s speculative. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Alternatively, if &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron has edges no longer than the edges of the parallelepiped. But again, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Therefore, given the problem as stated, with &quot;good&quot; meaning non-degenerate (positive volume), the answer is no. Because you can always find a tetrahedron too large to fit into a given parallelepiped, and a parallelepiped too small to contain a given tetrahedron.

Thus, the conclusion is that it&#x27;s not possible for any good tetrahedron to be placed inside any good parallelepiped. So, the answer is no.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped, we need to consider the definitions of &quot;good&quot; as non-degenerate, meaning both have positive volume. 

A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, and a parallelepiped is a three-dimensional figure formed by six parallelograms. The key points considered are:

1. **Volume Consideration**: A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors, while a parallelepiped&#x27;s volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its defining vectors. However, volume alone does not guarantee fitting one inside the other due to size constraints.
   
2. **Size and Shape Constraints**: A tetrahedron with a large volume or specific dimensions (e.g., long edge lengths) might not fit inside a parallelepiped with smaller dimensions. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of a parallelepiped cannot fit, regardless of rotation or translation.

3. **Rigid Transformations**: The problem implies placing the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped using only rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling. If a tetrahedron is too large in any dimension, it cannot fit inside a smaller parallelepiped even after rotation.

4. **Counterexamples**: Specific examples, such as a tetrahedron with a volume larger than the maximum volume that can fit inside a unit cube (which is \( \frac{1}{3} \)), demonstrate that it is not always possible to fit any tetrahedron inside any parallelepiped.

Given these considerations, it is concluded that there exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped due to size constraints. Therefore, the answer is:

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped are. A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, right? And a parallelepiped is like a 3D figure formed by six parallelograms. Now, the problem mentions &quot;good&quot; tetrahedron and &quot;good&quot; parallelepiped. I wonder what makes them &quot;good&quot;? Maybe they have some specific properties? Let me check.

Wait, maybe &quot;good&quot; here means that the tetrahedron is non-degenerate, so it has a positive volume, and similarly, the parallelepiped is non-degenerate with all edges contributing to a positive volume. That makes sense. So, a good tetrahedron is one where the four vertices aren&#x27;t all coplanar, and a good parallelepiped is one where the three vectors defining it aren&#x27;t coplanar either. So, both have positive volume. Alright.

So, the question is: Given any tetrahedron with positive volume, can it fit inside any parallelepiped with positive volume? Hmm. That seems a bit general. Maybe I need to think about the dimensions. A parallelepiped is determined by three vectors, and its volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of those vectors. A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is 1/6 of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors from one vertex. So, maybe there&#x27;s a relationship there?

But wait, the tetrahedron and the parallelepiped could have different orientations. Maybe the issue is whether, regardless of how the tetrahedron is shaped, as long as it&#x27;s non-degenerate, there exists a way to position it inside any non-degenerate parallelepiped. But that seems too broad. For example, if the parallelepiped is very small, how can a tetrahedron with a certain volume fit inside it?

Wait, but maybe the problem is about whether the tetrahedron can be scaled or something? But the question says &quot;placed inside,&quot; which I think means without scaling. So, the original tetrahedron has to fit inside the parallelepiped as is. But then, if the parallelepiped is smaller in some dimensions, the tetrahedron might not fit. So maybe the answer is no?

But the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, regardless of the sizes, can you always fit one into the other? That seems unlikely. For example, if the parallelepiped is very &quot;flat,&quot; meaning one of its dimensions is very small, while the tetrahedron is quite &quot;tall&quot; in that dimension, then you couldn&#x27;t fit the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe &quot;good&quot; implies some additional constraints? Maybe all edges of the parallelepiped are of length at least some value, and the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges are bounded? Hmm, the problem statement just says &quot;good,&quot; which the user probably defines as non-degenerate. So, assuming positive volume for both. Then, the answer would depend on whether any tetrahedron, regardless of its shape and size, can fit inside any parallelepiped, regardless of its shape and size. Which is not possible because of scaling issues.

But maybe the problem allows for rotation and translation of the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped? So, if you can rotate the tetrahedron appropriately, maybe it can fit even if the parallelepiped is not aligned with the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges. But still, if the parallelepiped is smaller in all dimensions than the tetrahedron&#x27;s corresponding dimensions, even after rotation, it might not fit.

Wait, but how do we define the &quot;dimensions&quot; of a tetrahedron? A tetrahedron doesn&#x27;t have obvious length, width, and height like a box. Its size is more related to its edge lengths or its volume. Similarly, the parallelepiped has three edge vectors, so its &quot;size&quot; in different directions is determined by those vectors.

Maybe the key here is that given any tetrahedron, you can scale the parallelepiped to contain it, but the problem states &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so you can&#x27;t choose the parallelepiped&#x27;s size. Wait, no, the question is whether any tetrahedron can be placed inside any parallelepiped. So, given any tetrahedron and any parallelepiped, both non-degenerate, can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped? That seems impossible because you could have a very large tetrahedron and a very small parallelepiped.

But wait, maybe &quot;any&quot; here is in terms of shape, not size? Like, regardless of the proportions, but assuming they can be scaled? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling. So, I think the answer is no. For example, imagine a tetrahedron with edge lengths all equal to 1 meter, and a parallelepiped that&#x27;s 1 centimeter in each dimension. Clearly, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit inside. So, unless scaling is allowed, which the problem doesn&#x27;t state, the answer should be no.

But wait, maybe the problem is in a mathematical sense, where we can have any size as long as they are non-degenerate. But mathematically, size matters. If the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped, it can&#x27;t fit. So, unless there is a way to compress or expand, which isn&#x27;t mentioned, the answer is no.

But maybe the problem is considering that both are in some normalized form? For example, volume-wise. If both have unit volume, can any tetrahedron fit inside any parallelepiped? That might be a different question. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify normalization.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different context where &quot;good&quot; implies some other conditions. Wait, the user just said &quot;good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;good parallelepiped.&quot; Maybe in the context where &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron is such that it can fit into a unit cube, and the parallelepiped is also unit? But I need to go back to the original problem statement.

The original problem is: &quot;Determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, with the definitions of &quot;good&quot; being non-degenerate. So, each has positive volume. So, the question is: Given any two such shapes (tetrahedron and parallelepiped), can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped?

This seems like it&#x27;s asking if for all tetrahedrons T and for all parallelepipeds P (all non-degenerate), T can be placed inside P. Which is not true. For example, take a very &quot;large&quot; tetrahedron and a very &quot;small&quot; parallelepiped. The tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, maybe the question is reversed: Can any parallelepiped contain any tetrahedron? But still, no, because of size constraints.

But maybe the problem is in terms of similarity or something else. Wait, perhaps in terms of proportions rather than absolute size. For instance, regardless of the tetrahedron&#x27;s shape, there exists a parallelepiped with the same shape (up to scaling) that can contain it. But the problem says &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so the parallelepiped is given, not chosen based on the tetrahedron.

Wait, maybe the problem is more about the geometric relations, like whether the tetrahedron can be embedded inside the parallelepiped through affine transformations. But affine transformations can scale, rotate, shear, etc. If you allow affine transformations, then any tetrahedron can be transformed into any other tetrahedron, but the problem is about placing inside a parallelepiped. If you can apply affine transformations to the tetrahedron, then you can certainly fit it inside any parallelepiped, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify if such transformations are allowed.

But the wording is &quot;placed inside,&quot; which usually in geometry problems means using rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling or shearing. So, if you can only translate and rotate the tetrahedron, then whether it can fit inside the parallelepiped depends on their relative sizes and shapes.

Therefore, if the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped in some dimension, even after rotation, it can&#x27;t fit. For example, suppose the parallelepiped is a very thin rectangular prism (close to a flat box), and the tetrahedron is a regular tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the thickness of the prism. Then, no matter how you rotate the tetrahedron, its projection along the prism&#x27;s shortest axis would exceed the prism&#x27;s dimension in that axis. Hence, it can&#x27;t fit.

Therefore, the answer should be no. However, maybe there&#x27;s a different way to think about it. Let me consider specific examples.

Take a unit cube as the parallelepiped. Can any tetrahedron with, say, volume greater than 1/6 fit inside it? Wait, the maximum volume of a tetrahedron inside a cube is 1/3 (achieved by a corner tetrahedron). So, if a tetrahedron has a volume larger than 1/3, it can&#x27;t fit inside the cube. But the cube is a specific case of a parallelepiped. So, if I have a tetrahedron with volume larger than 1/3, then it can&#x27;t fit inside a unit cube. Therefore, such a tetrahedron cannot be placed inside a unit cube, even though both are &quot;good&quot; (non-degenerate). Therefore, the answer is no.

But wait, the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, in this case, there exists a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped (both good) such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. Therefore, the answer is no.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that you can choose the orientation and position of the tetrahedron within the parallelepiped. But even so, if the tetrahedron is too large in some direction, it can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different setting where scaling is allowed, but the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling, so I think it&#x27;s not.

Wait, but the problem might be in a mathematical context where sizes are not considered, but only the combinatorial or topological aspects. But in standard geometry, size matters. So, unless specified otherwise, we have to consider size.

Therefore, based on the above reasoning, the answer should be no. However, let me verify once more.

Suppose we have a tetrahedron with a very long edge. Then, the minimal parallelepiped that can contain it must have at least one edge as long as the longest edge of the tetrahedron. If the given parallelepiped doesn&#x27;t have any edge as long as that, then the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Therefore, unless the parallelepiped is at least as large as the tetrahedron in all dimensions, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Since &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped includes ones that are smaller in some dimensions, the answer is no.

Therefore, the answer is no, it is not possible to place any good tetrahedron inside any good parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a different interpretation. Maybe the problem is in terms of combinatorial placement, like whether the vertices can be placed inside the parallelepiped regardless of the edges? But no, the tetrahedron is a solid, so all its points must be inside the parallelepiped.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about affine equivalence. But affine transformations can change the shape, but again, unless allowed, the answer remains no.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question. For example, since a tetrahedron can be decomposed into parallelepipeds or something? But that&#x27;s not standard.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that a tetrahedron can fit inside a parallelepiped if you can embed its vertices within the parallelepiped&#x27;s vertices, but that&#x27;s a different question. For example, a cube (a special case of a parallelepiped) can have a tetrahedron inscribed within it by connecting four of its vertices. But the problem is about any tetrahedron into any parallelepiped.

Wait, perhaps the key is that any tetrahedron can be affinely transformed into any other tetrahedron, but here we are dealing with a parallelepiped. If we can use affine transformations, then we can map a tetrahedron into a parallelepiped, but the problem states &quot;placed inside,&quot; which might not allow for such transformations.

Alternatively, consider that a parallelepiped can be divided into six tetrahedrons, each of which is similar to the others? Wait, no, not necessarily. A cube can be divided into six square pyramids, but that&#x27;s different.

Wait, perhaps the answer is yes, and I&#x27;m missing something. Let me think again.

Suppose we have any tetrahedron. Let&#x27;s consider its minimum bounding box. A bounding box is a parallelepiped (specifically, a rectangular prism if aligned with axes). Then, if we can show that any parallelepiped can contain any such bounding box, then the tetrahedron can be placed inside. But that&#x27;s not true because the bounding box&#x27;s dimensions depend on the tetrahedron, and the given parallelepiped might not have the required dimensions.

Alternatively, maybe by rotating the tetrahedron, we can fit it into a smaller parallelepiped? For example, the minimal volume parallelepiped enclosing a tetrahedron can be found by rotating the tetrahedron such that its edges align with the parallelepiped&#x27;s vectors. However, the volume of the minimal enclosing parallelepiped would depend on the tetrahedron&#x27;s geometry.

But the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, which might have a different orientation and size. So, even if the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal enclosing parallelepiped is smaller, the given parallelepiped might not have the right orientation or size.

Wait, perhaps if the parallelepiped is scaled such that it can contain the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal bounding parallelepiped. But the problem doesn&#x27;t allow scaling the parallelepiped. The parallelepiped is given, and we need to fit the tetrahedron inside it as is.

Alternatively, if the given parallelepiped is larger in all directions than the minimal bounding parallelepiped of the tetrahedron, then it can fit. But since the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, including smaller ones, the answer remains no.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a way to fold the tetrahedron into the parallelepiped? But in three-dimensional geometry, folding isn&#x27;t possible without tearing, so that&#x27;s not applicable.

Alternatively, using some projection or something? I don&#x27;t think so. To place a tetrahedron inside a parallelepiped, all its vertices must lie within the parallelepiped, and the edges must connect those vertices inside the parallelepiped. But if the parallelepiped is too small in some direction, the tetrahedron&#x27;s vertex coordinates would exceed the parallelepiped&#x27;s bounds in that direction.

Therefore, considering all this, the answer should be no. There exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of the parallelepiped cannot fit.

But maybe the problem uses &quot;good&quot; in a different way. Maybe a good tetrahedron is one that is contained within a unit cube, and a good parallelepiped is one that contains a unit cube? Then, perhaps any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. But that&#x27;s speculative. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Alternatively, if &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron has edges no longer than the edges of the parallelepiped. But again, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Therefore, given the problem as stated, with &quot;good&quot; meaning non-degenerate (positive volume), the answer is no. Because you can always find a tetrahedron too large to fit into a given parallelepiped, and a parallelepiped too small to contain a given tetrahedron.

Thus, the conclusion is that it&#x27;s not possible for any good tetrahedron to be placed inside any good parallelepiped. So, the answer is no.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped, we need to consider the definitions of &quot;good&quot; as non-degenerate, meaning both have positive volume. 

A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, and a parallelepiped is a three-dimensional figure formed by six parallelograms. The key points considered are:

1. **Volume Consideration**: A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors, while a parallelepiped&#x27;s volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its defining vectors. However, volume alone does not guarantee fitting one inside the other due to size constraints.
   
2. **Size and Shape Constraints**: A tetrahedron with a large volume or specific dimensions (e.g., long edge lengths) might not fit inside a parallelepiped with smaller dimensions. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of a parallelepiped cannot fit, regardless of rotation or translation.

3. **Rigid Transformations**: The problem implies placing the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped using only rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling. If a tetrahedron is too large in any dimension, it cannot fit inside a smaller parallelepiped even after rotation.

4. **Counterexamples**: Specific examples, such as a tetrahedron with a volume larger than the maximum volume that can fit inside a unit cube (which is \( \frac{1}{3} \)), demonstrate that it is not always possible to fit any tetrahedron inside any parallelepiped.

Given these considerations, it is concluded that there exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped due to size constraints. Therefore, the answer is:

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped are. A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, right? And a parallelepiped is like a 3D figure formed by six parallelograms. Now, the problem mentions &quot;good&quot; tetrahedron and &quot;good&quot; parallelepiped. I wonder what makes them &quot;good&quot;? Maybe they have some specific properties? Let me check.

Wait, maybe &quot;good&quot; here means that the tetrahedron is non-degenerate, so it has a positive volume, and similarly, the parallelepiped is non-degenerate with all edges contributing to a positive volume. That makes sense. So, a good tetrahedron is one where the four vertices aren&#x27;t all coplanar, and a good parallelepiped is one where the three vectors defining it aren&#x27;t coplanar either. So, both have positive volume. Alright.

So, the question is: Given any tetrahedron with positive volume, can it fit inside any parallelepiped with positive volume? Hmm. That seems a bit general. Maybe I need to think about the dimensions. A parallelepiped is determined by three vectors, and its volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of those vectors. A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is 1/6 of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors from one vertex. So, maybe there&#x27;s a relationship there?

But wait, the tetrahedron and the parallelepiped could have different orientations. Maybe the issue is whether, regardless of how the tetrahedron is shaped, as long as it&#x27;s non-degenerate, there exists a way to position it inside any non-degenerate parallelepiped. But that seems too broad. For example, if the parallelepiped is very small, how can a tetrahedron with a certain volume fit inside it?

Wait, but maybe the problem is about whether the tetrahedron can be scaled or something? But the question says &quot;placed inside,&quot; which I think means without scaling. So, the original tetrahedron has to fit inside the parallelepiped as is. But then, if the parallelepiped is smaller in some dimensions, the tetrahedron might not fit. So maybe the answer is no?

But the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, regardless of the sizes, can you always fit one into the other? That seems unlikely. For example, if the parallelepiped is very &quot;flat,&quot; meaning one of its dimensions is very small, while the tetrahedron is quite &quot;tall&quot; in that dimension, then you couldn&#x27;t fit the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe &quot;good&quot; implies some additional constraints? Maybe all edges of the parallelepiped are of length at least some value, and the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges are bounded? Hmm, the problem statement just says &quot;good,&quot; which the user probably defines as non-degenerate. So, assuming positive volume for both. Then, the answer would depend on whether any tetrahedron, regardless of its shape and size, can fit inside any parallelepiped, regardless of its shape and size. Which is not possible because of scaling issues.

But maybe the problem allows for rotation and translation of the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped? So, if you can rotate the tetrahedron appropriately, maybe it can fit even if the parallelepiped is not aligned with the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges. But still, if the parallelepiped is smaller in all dimensions than the tetrahedron&#x27;s corresponding dimensions, even after rotation, it might not fit.

Wait, but how do we define the &quot;dimensions&quot; of a tetrahedron? A tetrahedron doesn&#x27;t have obvious length, width, and height like a box. Its size is more related to its edge lengths or its volume. Similarly, the parallelepiped has three edge vectors, so its &quot;size&quot; in different directions is determined by those vectors.

Maybe the key here is that given any tetrahedron, you can scale the parallelepiped to contain it, but the problem states &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so you can&#x27;t choose the parallelepiped&#x27;s size. Wait, no, the question is whether any tetrahedron can be placed inside any parallelepiped. So, given any tetrahedron and any parallelepiped, both non-degenerate, can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped? That seems impossible because you could have a very large tetrahedron and a very small parallelepiped.

But wait, maybe &quot;any&quot; here is in terms of shape, not size? Like, regardless of the proportions, but assuming they can be scaled? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling. So, I think the answer is no. For example, imagine a tetrahedron with edge lengths all equal to 1 meter, and a parallelepiped that&#x27;s 1 centimeter in each dimension. Clearly, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit inside. So, unless scaling is allowed, which the problem doesn&#x27;t state, the answer should be no.

But wait, maybe the problem is in a mathematical sense, where we can have any size as long as they are non-degenerate. But mathematically, size matters. If the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped, it can&#x27;t fit. So, unless there is a way to compress or expand, which isn&#x27;t mentioned, the answer is no.

But maybe the problem is considering that both are in some normalized form? For example, volume-wise. If both have unit volume, can any tetrahedron fit inside any parallelepiped? That might be a different question. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify normalization.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different context where &quot;good&quot; implies some other conditions. Wait, the user just said &quot;good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;good parallelepiped.&quot; Maybe in the context where &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron is such that it can fit into a unit cube, and the parallelepiped is also unit? But I need to go back to the original problem statement.

The original problem is: &quot;Determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, with the definitions of &quot;good&quot; being non-degenerate. So, each has positive volume. So, the question is: Given any two such shapes (tetrahedron and parallelepiped), can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped?

This seems like it&#x27;s asking if for all tetrahedrons T and for all parallelepipeds P (all non-degenerate), T can be placed inside P. Which is not true. For example, take a very &quot;large&quot; tetrahedron and a very &quot;small&quot; parallelepiped. The tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, maybe the question is reversed: Can any parallelepiped contain any tetrahedron? But still, no, because of size constraints.

But maybe the problem is in terms of similarity or something else. Wait, perhaps in terms of proportions rather than absolute size. For instance, regardless of the tetrahedron&#x27;s shape, there exists a parallelepiped with the same shape (up to scaling) that can contain it. But the problem says &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so the parallelepiped is given, not chosen based on the tetrahedron.

Wait, maybe the problem is more about the geometric relations, like whether the tetrahedron can be embedded inside the parallelepiped through affine transformations. But affine transformations can scale, rotate, shear, etc. If you allow affine transformations, then any tetrahedron can be transformed into any other tetrahedron, but the problem is about placing inside a parallelepiped. If you can apply affine transformations to the tetrahedron, then you can certainly fit it inside any parallelepiped, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify if such transformations are allowed.

But the wording is &quot;placed inside,&quot; which usually in geometry problems means using rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling or shearing. So, if you can only translate and rotate the tetrahedron, then whether it can fit inside the parallelepiped depends on their relative sizes and shapes.

Therefore, if the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped in some dimension, even after rotation, it can&#x27;t fit. For example, suppose the parallelepiped is a very thin rectangular prism (close to a flat box), and the tetrahedron is a regular tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the thickness of the prism. Then, no matter how you rotate the tetrahedron, its projection along the prism&#x27;s shortest axis would exceed the prism&#x27;s dimension in that axis. Hence, it can&#x27;t fit.

Therefore, the answer should be no. However, maybe there&#x27;s a different way to think about it. Let me consider specific examples.

Take a unit cube as the parallelepiped. Can any tetrahedron with, say, volume greater than 1/6 fit inside it? Wait, the maximum volume of a tetrahedron inside a cube is 1/3 (achieved by a corner tetrahedron). So, if a tetrahedron has a volume larger than 1/3, it can&#x27;t fit inside the cube. But the cube is a specific case of a parallelepiped. So, if I have a tetrahedron with volume larger than 1/3, then it can&#x27;t fit inside a unit cube. Therefore, such a tetrahedron cannot be placed inside a unit cube, even though both are &quot;good&quot; (non-degenerate). Therefore, the answer is no.

But wait, the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, in this case, there exists a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped (both good) such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. Therefore, the answer is no.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that you can choose the orientation and position of the tetrahedron within the parallelepiped. But even so, if the tetrahedron is too large in some direction, it can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different setting where scaling is allowed, but the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling, so I think it&#x27;s not.

Wait, but the problem might be in a mathematical context where sizes are not considered, but only the combinatorial or topological aspects. But in standard geometry, size matters. So, unless specified otherwise, we have to consider size.

Therefore, based on the above reasoning, the answer should be no. However, let me verify once more.

Suppose we have a tetrahedron with a very long edge. Then, the minimal parallelepiped that can contain it must have at least one edge as long as the longest edge of the tetrahedron. If the given parallelepiped doesn&#x27;t have any edge as long as that, then the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Therefore, unless the parallelepiped is at least as large as the tetrahedron in all dimensions, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Since &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped includes ones that are smaller in some dimensions, the answer is no.

Therefore, the answer is no, it is not possible to place any good tetrahedron inside any good parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a different interpretation. Maybe the problem is in terms of combinatorial placement, like whether the vertices can be placed inside the parallelepiped regardless of the edges? But no, the tetrahedron is a solid, so all its points must be inside the parallelepiped.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about affine equivalence. But affine transformations can change the shape, but again, unless allowed, the answer remains no.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question. For example, since a tetrahedron can be decomposed into parallelepipeds or something? But that&#x27;s not standard.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that a tetrahedron can fit inside a parallelepiped if you can embed its vertices within the parallelepiped&#x27;s vertices, but that&#x27;s a different question. For example, a cube (a special case of a parallelepiped) can have a tetrahedron inscribed within it by connecting four of its vertices. But the problem is about any tetrahedron into any parallelepiped.

Wait, perhaps the key is that any tetrahedron can be affinely transformed into any other tetrahedron, but here we are dealing with a parallelepiped. If we can use affine transformations, then we can map a tetrahedron into a parallelepiped, but the problem states &quot;placed inside,&quot; which might not allow for such transformations.

Alternatively, consider that a parallelepiped can be divided into six tetrahedrons, each of which is similar to the others? Wait, no, not necessarily. A cube can be divided into six square pyramids, but that&#x27;s different.

Wait, perhaps the answer is yes, and I&#x27;m missing something. Let me think again.

Suppose we have any tetrahedron. Let&#x27;s consider its minimum bounding box. A bounding box is a parallelepiped (specifically, a rectangular prism if aligned with axes). Then, if we can show that any parallelepiped can contain any such bounding box, then the tetrahedron can be placed inside. But that&#x27;s not true because the bounding box&#x27;s dimensions depend on the tetrahedron, and the given parallelepiped might not have the required dimensions.

Alternatively, maybe by rotating the tetrahedron, we can fit it into a smaller parallelepiped? For example, the minimal volume parallelepiped enclosing a tetrahedron can be found by rotating the tetrahedron such that its edges align with the parallelepiped&#x27;s vectors. However, the volume of the minimal enclosing parallelepiped would depend on the tetrahedron&#x27;s geometry.

But the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, which might have a different orientation and size. So, even if the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal enclosing parallelepiped is smaller, the given parallelepiped might not have the right orientation or size.

Wait, perhaps if the parallelepiped is scaled such that it can contain the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal bounding parallelepiped. But the problem doesn&#x27;t allow scaling the parallelepiped. The parallelepiped is given, and we need to fit the tetrahedron inside it as is.

Alternatively, if the given parallelepiped is larger in all directions than the minimal bounding parallelepiped of the tetrahedron, then it can fit. But since the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, including smaller ones, the answer remains no.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a way to fold the tetrahedron into the parallelepiped? But in three-dimensional geometry, folding isn&#x27;t possible without tearing, so that&#x27;s not applicable.

Alternatively, using some projection or something? I don&#x27;t think so. To place a tetrahedron inside a parallelepiped, all its vertices must lie within the parallelepiped, and the edges must connect those vertices inside the parallelepiped. But if the parallelepiped is too small in some direction, the tetrahedron&#x27;s vertex coordinates would exceed the parallelepiped&#x27;s bounds in that direction.

Therefore, considering all this, the answer should be no. There exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of the parallelepiped cannot fit.

But maybe the problem uses &quot;good&quot; in a different way. Maybe a good tetrahedron is one that is contained within a unit cube, and a good parallelepiped is one that contains a unit cube? Then, perhaps any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. But that&#x27;s speculative. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Alternatively, if &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron has edges no longer than the edges of the parallelepiped. But again, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Therefore, given the problem as stated, with &quot;good&quot; meaning non-degenerate (positive volume), the answer is no. Because you can always find a tetrahedron too large to fit into a given parallelepiped, and a parallelepiped too small to contain a given tetrahedron.

Thus, the conclusion is that it&#x27;s not possible for any good tetrahedron to be placed inside any good parallelepiped. So, the answer is no.

That makes sense. So, a good tetrahedron is one where the four vertices aren&#x27;t all coplanar, and a good parallelepiped is one where the three vectors defining it aren&#x27;t coplanar either.

A parallelepiped is determined by three vectors, and its volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of those vectors. A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is 1/6 of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors from one vertex. So, maybe there&#x27;s a relationship there?

But wait, the tetrahedron and the parallelepiped could have different orientations. Maybe the issue is whether, regardless of how the tetrahedron is shaped, as long as it&#x27;s non-degenerate, there exists a way to position it inside any non-degenerate parallelepiped. But that seems too broad. For example, if the parallelepiped is very small, how can a tetrahedron with a certain volume fit inside it?

Wait, but maybe the problem is about whether the tetrahedron can be scaled or something? But the question says &quot;placed inside,&quot; which I think means without scaling. So, the original tetrahedron has to fit inside the parallelepiped as is. But then, if the parallelepiped is smaller in some dimensions, the tetrahedron might not fit. So maybe the answer is no?

For example, if the parallelepiped is very &quot;flat,&quot; meaning one of its dimensions is very small, while the tetrahedron is quite &quot;tall&quot; in that dimension, then you couldn&#x27;t fit the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe &quot;good&quot; implies some additional constraints? Maybe all edges of the parallelepiped are of length at least some value, and the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges are bounded? Hmm, the problem statement just says &quot;good,&quot; which the user probably defines as non-degenerate. So, assuming positive volume for both. Then, the answer would depend on whether any tetrahedron, regardless of its shape and size, can fit inside any parallelepiped, regardless of its shape and size. Which is not possible because of scaling issues.

But maybe the problem allows for rotation and translation of the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped? So, if you can rotate the tetrahedron appropriately, maybe it can fit even if the parallelepiped is not aligned with the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges. But still, if the parallelepiped is smaller in all dimensions than the tetrahedron&#x27;s corresponding dimensions, even after rotation, it might not fit.

Wait, but how do we define the &quot;dimensions&quot; of a tetrahedron? A tetrahedron doesn&#x27;t have obvious length, width, and height like a box. Its size is more related to its edge lengths or its volume. Similarly, the parallelepiped has three edge vectors, so its &quot;size&quot; in different directions is determined by those vectors.

Maybe the key here is that given any tetrahedron, you can scale the parallelepiped to contain it, but the problem states &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so you can&#x27;t choose the parallelepiped&#x27;s size. Wait, no, the question is whether any tetrahedron can be placed inside any parallelepiped. So, given any tetrahedron and any parallelepiped, both non-degenerate, can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped? That seems impossible because you could have a very large tetrahedron and a very small parallelepiped.

But maybe the problem is considering that both are in some normalized form? For example, volume-wise. If both have unit volume, can any tetrahedron fit inside any parallelepiped? That might be a different question. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify normalization.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different context where &quot;good&quot; implies some other conditions. Wait, the user just said &quot;good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;good parallelepiped.&quot; Maybe in the context where &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron is such that it can fit into a unit cube, and the parallelepiped is also unit? But I need to go back to the original problem statement.

The original problem is: &quot;Determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, with the definitions of &quot;good&quot; being non-degenerate. So, each has positive volume. So, the question is: Given any two such shapes (tetrahedron and parallelepiped), can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped?

This seems like it&#x27;s asking if for all tetrahedrons T and for all parallelepipeds P (all non-degenerate), T can be placed inside P. Which is not true. For example, take a very &quot;large&quot; tetrahedron and a very &quot;small&quot; parallelepiped. The tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, maybe the question is reversed: Can any parallelepiped contain any tetrahedron? But still, no, because of size constraints.

But maybe the problem is in terms of similarity or something else. Wait, perhaps in terms of proportions rather than absolute size. For instance, regardless of the tetrahedron&#x27;s shape, there exists a parallelepiped with the same shape (up to scaling) that can contain it. But the problem says &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so the parallelepiped is given, not chosen based on the tetrahedron.

Wait, maybe the problem is more about the geometric relations, like whether the tetrahedron can be embedded inside the parallelepiped through affine transformations. But affine transformations can scale, rotate, shear, etc. If you allow affine transformations, then any tetrahedron can be transformed into any other tetrahedron, but the problem is about placing inside a parallelepiped. If you can apply affine transformations to the tetrahedron, then you can certainly fit it inside any parallelepiped, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify if such transformations are allowed.

But the wording is &quot;placed inside,&quot; which usually in geometry problems means using rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling or shearing. So, if you can only translate and rotate the tetrahedron, then whether it can fit inside the parallelepiped depends on their relative sizes and shapes.

Therefore, if the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped in some dimension, even after rotation, it can&#x27;t fit. For example, suppose the parallelepiped is a very thin rectangular prism (close to a flat box), and the tetrahedron is a regular tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the thickness of the prism. Then, no matter how you rotate the tetrahedron, its projection along the prism&#x27;s shortest axis would exceed the prism&#x27;s dimension in that axis. Hence, it can&#x27;t fit.

Therefore, the answer should be no. However, maybe there&#x27;s a different way to think about it. Let me consider specific examples.

Take a unit cube as the parallelepiped. Can any tetrahedron with, say, volume greater than 1/6 fit inside it? Wait, the maximum volume of a tetrahedron inside a cube is 1/3 (achieved by a corner tetrahedron). So, if a tetrahedron has a volume larger than 1/3, it can&#x27;t fit inside the cube. But the cube is a specific case of a parallelepiped. So, if I have a tetrahedron with volume larger than 1/3, then it can&#x27;t fit inside a unit cube. Therefore, such a tetrahedron cannot be placed inside a unit cube, even though both are &quot;good&quot; (non-degenerate). Therefore, the answer is no.

But wait, the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, in this case, there exists a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped (both good) such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. Therefore, the answer is no.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that you can choose the orientation and position of the tetrahedron within the parallelepiped. But even so, if the tetrahedron is too large in some direction, it can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different setting where scaling is allowed, but the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling, so I think it&#x27;s not.

Wait, but the problem might be in a mathematical context where sizes are not considered, but only the combinatorial or topological aspects. But in standard geometry, size matters. So, unless specified otherwise, we have to consider size.

Therefore, based on the above reasoning, the answer should be no. However, let me verify once more.

Suppose we have a tetrahedron with a very long edge. Then, the minimal parallelepiped that can contain it must have at least one edge as long as the longest edge of the tetrahedron. If the given parallelepiped doesn&#x27;t have any edge as long as that, then the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Therefore, unless the parallelepiped is at least as large as the tetrahedron in all dimensions, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Since &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped includes ones that are smaller in some dimensions, the answer is no.

Therefore, the answer is no, it is not possible to place any good tetrahedron inside any good parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a different interpretation. Maybe the problem is in terms of combinatorial placement, like whether the vertices can be placed inside the parallelepiped regardless of the edges? But no, the tetrahedron is a solid, so all its points must be inside the parallelepiped.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about affine equivalence. But affine transformations can change the shape, but again, unless allowed, the answer remains no.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question. For example, since a tetrahedron can be decomposed into parallelepipeds or something? But that&#x27;s not standard.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that a tetrahedron can fit inside a parallelepiped if you can embed its vertices within the parallelepiped&#x27;s vertices, but that&#x27;s a different question. For example, a cube (a special case of a parallelepiped) can have a tetrahedron inscribed within it by connecting four of its vertices. But the problem is about any tetrahedron into any parallelepiped.

Wait, perhaps the key is that any tetrahedron can be affinely transformed into any other tetrahedron, but here we are dealing with a parallelepiped. If we can use affine transformations, then we can map a tetrahedron into a parallelepiped, but the problem states &quot;placed inside,&quot; which might not allow for such transformations.

Alternatively, consider that a parallelepiped can be divided into six tetrahedrons, each of which is similar to the others? Wait, no, not necessarily. A cube can be divided into six square pyramids, but that&#x27;s different.

Wait, perhaps the answer is yes, and I&#x27;m missing something. Let me think again.

Suppose we have any tetrahedron. Let&#x27;s consider its minimum bounding box. A bounding box is a parallelepiped (specifically, a rectangular prism if aligned with axes). Then, if we can show that any parallelepiped can contain any such bounding box, then the tetrahedron can be placed inside. But that&#x27;s not true because the bounding box&#x27;s dimensions depend on the tetrahedron, and the given parallelepiped might not have the required dimensions.

Alternatively, maybe by rotating the tetrahedron, we can fit it into a smaller parallelepiped? For example, the minimal volume parallelepiped enclosing a tetrahedron can be found by rotating the tetrahedron such that its edges align with the parallelepiped&#x27;s vectors. However, the volume of the minimal enclosing parallelepiped would depend on the tetrahedron&#x27;s geometry.

But the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, which might have a different orientation and size. So, even if the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal enclosing parallelepiped is smaller, the given parallelepiped might not have the right orientation or size.

Wait, perhaps if the parallelepiped is scaled such that it can contain the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal bounding parallelepiped. But the problem doesn&#x27;t allow scaling the parallelepiped. The parallelepiped is given, and we need to fit the tetrahedron inside it as is.

Alternatively, if the given parallelepiped is larger in all directions than the minimal bounding parallelepiped of the tetrahedron, then it can fit. But since the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, including smaller ones, the answer remains no.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a way to fold the tetrahedron into the parallelepiped? But in three-dimensional geometry, folding isn&#x27;t possible without tearing, so that&#x27;s not applicable.

Alternatively, using some projection or something? I don&#x27;t think so. To place a tetrahedron inside a parallelepiped, all its vertices must lie within the parallelepiped, and the edges must connect those vertices inside the parallelepiped. But if the parallelepiped is too small in some direction, the tetrahedron&#x27;s vertex coordinates would exceed the parallelepiped&#x27;s bounds in that direction.

Therefore, considering all this, the answer should be no. There exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of the parallelepiped cannot fit.

But maybe the problem uses &quot;good&quot; in a different way. Maybe a good tetrahedron is one that is contained within a unit cube, and a good parallelepiped is one that contains a unit cube? Then, perhaps any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. But that&#x27;s speculative. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Alternatively, if &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron has edges no longer than the edges of the parallelepiped. But again, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Therefore, given the problem as stated, with &quot;good&quot; meaning non-degenerate (positive volume), the answer is no. Because you can always find a tetrahedron too large to fit into a given parallelepiped, and a parallelepiped too small to contain a given tetrahedron.

Thus, the conclusion is that it&#x27;s not possible for any good tetrahedron to be placed inside any good parallelepiped. So, the answer is no.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped, we need to consider the definitions of &quot;good&quot; as non-degenerate, meaning both have positive volume. 

A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, and a parallelepiped is a three-dimensional figure formed by six parallelograms. The key points considered are:

1. **Volume Consideration**: A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors, while a parallelepiped&#x27;s volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its defining vectors. However, volume alone does not guarantee fitting one inside the other due to size constraints.
   
2. **Size and Shape Constraints**: A tetrahedron with a large volume or specific dimensions (e.g., long edge lengths) might not fit inside a parallelepiped with smaller dimensions. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of a parallelepiped cannot fit, regardless of rotation or translation.

3. **Rigid Transformations**: The problem implies placing the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped using only rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling. If a tetrahedron is too large in any dimension, it cannot fit inside a smaller parallelepiped even after rotation.

4. **Counterexamples**: Specific examples, such as a tetrahedron with a volume larger than the maximum volume that can fit inside a unit cube (which is \( \frac{1}{3} \)), demonstrate that it is not always possible to fit any tetrahedron inside any parallelepiped.

Given these considerations, it is concluded that there exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped due to size constraints. Therefore, the answer is:

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped are. A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, right? And a parallelepiped is like a 3D figure formed by six parallelograms. Now, the problem mentions &quot;good&quot; tetrahedron and &quot;good&quot; parallelepiped. I wonder what makes them &quot;good&quot;? Maybe they have some specific properties? Let me check.

Wait, maybe &quot;good&quot; here means that the tetrahedron is non-degenerate, so it has a positive volume, and similarly, the parallelepiped is non-degenerate with all edges contributing to a positive volume. That makes sense. So, a good tetrahedron is one where the four vertices aren&#x27;t all coplanar, and a good parallelepiped is one where the three vectors defining it aren&#x27;t coplanar either. So, both have positive volume. Alright.

So, the question is: Given any tetrahedron with positive volume, can it fit inside any parallelepiped with positive volume? Hmm. That seems a bit general. Maybe I need to think about the dimensions. A parallelepiped is determined by three vectors, and its volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of those vectors. A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is 1/6 of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors from one vertex. So, maybe there&#x27;s a relationship there?

But wait, the tetrahedron and the parallelepiped could have different orientations. Maybe the issue is whether, regardless of how the tetrahedron is shaped, as long as it&#x27;s non-degenerate, there exists a way to position it inside any non-degenerate parallelepiped. But that seems too broad. For example, if the parallelepiped is very small, how can a tetrahedron with a certain volume fit inside it?

Wait, but maybe the problem is about whether the tetrahedron can be scaled or something? But the question says &quot;placed inside,&quot; which I think means without scaling. So, the original tetrahedron has to fit inside the parallelepiped as is. But then, if the parallelepiped is smaller in some dimensions, the tetrahedron might not fit. So maybe the answer is no?

But the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, regardless of the sizes, can you always fit one into the other? That seems unlikely. For example, if the parallelepiped is very &quot;flat,&quot; meaning one of its dimensions is very small, while the tetrahedron is quite &quot;tall&quot; in that dimension, then you couldn&#x27;t fit the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe &quot;good&quot; implies some additional constraints? Maybe all edges of the parallelepiped are of length at least some value, and the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges are bounded? Hmm, the problem statement just says &quot;good,&quot; which the user probably defines as non-degenerate. So, assuming positive volume for both. Then, the answer would depend on whether any tetrahedron, regardless of its shape and size, can fit inside any parallelepiped, regardless of its shape and size. Which is not possible because of scaling issues.

But maybe the problem allows for rotation and translation of the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped? So, if you can rotate the tetrahedron appropriately, maybe it can fit even if the parallelepiped is not aligned with the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges. But still, if the parallelepiped is smaller in all dimensions than the tetrahedron&#x27;s corresponding dimensions, even after rotation, it might not fit.

Wait, but how do we define the &quot;dimensions&quot; of a tetrahedron? A tetrahedron doesn&#x27;t have obvious length, width, and height like a box. Its size is more related to its edge lengths or its volume. Similarly, the parallelepiped has three edge vectors, so its &quot;size&quot; in different directions is determined by those vectors.

Maybe the key here is that given any tetrahedron, you can scale the parallelepiped to contain it, but the problem states &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so you can&#x27;t choose the parallelepiped&#x27;s size. Wait, no, the question is whether any tetrahedron can be placed inside any parallelepiped. So, given any tetrahedron and any parallelepiped, both non-degenerate, can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped? That seems impossible because you could have a very large tetrahedron and a very small parallelepiped.

But wait, maybe &quot;any&quot; here is in terms of shape, not size? Like, regardless of the proportions, but assuming they can be scaled? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling. So, I think the answer is no. For example, imagine a tetrahedron with edge lengths all equal to 1 meter, and a parallelepiped that&#x27;s 1 centimeter in each dimension. Clearly, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit inside. So, unless scaling is allowed, which the problem doesn&#x27;t state, the answer should be no.

But wait, maybe the problem is in a mathematical sense, where we can have any size as long as they are non-degenerate. But mathematically, size matters. If the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped, it can&#x27;t fit. So, unless there is a way to compress or expand, which isn&#x27;t mentioned, the answer is no.

But maybe the problem is considering that both are in some normalized form? For example, volume-wise. If both have unit volume, can any tetrahedron fit inside any parallelepiped? That might be a different question. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify normalization.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different context where &quot;good&quot; implies some other conditions. Wait, the user just said &quot;good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;good parallelepiped.&quot; Maybe in the context where &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron is such that it can fit into a unit cube, and the parallelepiped is also unit? But I need to go back to the original problem statement.

The original problem is: &quot;Determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, with the definitions of &quot;good&quot; being non-degenerate. So, each has positive volume. So, the question is: Given any two such shapes (tetrahedron and parallelepiped), can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped?

This seems like it&#x27;s asking if for all tetrahedrons T and for all parallelepipeds P (all non-degenerate), T can be placed inside P. Which is not true. For example, take a very &quot;large&quot; tetrahedron and a very &quot;small&quot; parallelepiped. The tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, maybe the question is reversed: Can any parallelepiped contain any tetrahedron? But still, no, because of size constraints.

But maybe the problem is in terms of similarity or something else. Wait, perhaps in terms of proportions rather than absolute size. For instance, regardless of the tetrahedron&#x27;s shape, there exists a parallelepiped with the same shape (up to scaling) that can contain it. But the problem says &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so the parallelepiped is given, not chosen based on the tetrahedron.

Wait, maybe the problem is more about the geometric relations, like whether the tetrahedron can be embedded inside the parallelepiped through affine transformations. But affine transformations can scale, rotate, shear, etc. If you allow affine transformations, then any tetrahedron can be transformed into any other tetrahedron, but the problem is about placing inside a parallelepiped. If you can apply affine transformations to the tetrahedron, then you can certainly fit it inside any parallelepiped, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify if such transformations are allowed.

But the wording is &quot;placed inside,&quot; which usually in geometry problems means using rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling or shearing. So, if you can only translate and rotate the tetrahedron, then whether it can fit inside the parallelepiped depends on their relative sizes and shapes.

Therefore, if the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped in some dimension, even after rotation, it can&#x27;t fit. For example, suppose the parallelepiped is a very thin rectangular prism (close to a flat box), and the tetrahedron is a regular tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the thickness of the prism. Then, no matter how you rotate the tetrahedron, its projection along the prism&#x27;s shortest axis would exceed the prism&#x27;s dimension in that axis. Hence, it can&#x27;t fit.

Therefore, the answer should be no. However, maybe there&#x27;s a different way to think about it. Let me consider specific examples.

Take a unit cube as the parallelepiped. Can any tetrahedron with, say, volume greater than 1/6 fit inside it? Wait, the maximum volume of a tetrahedron inside a cube is 1/3 (achieved by a corner tetrahedron). So, if a tetrahedron has a volume larger than 1/3, it can&#x27;t fit inside the cube. But the cube is a specific case of a parallelepiped. So, if I have a tetrahedron with volume larger than 1/3, then it can&#x27;t fit inside a unit cube. Therefore, such a tetrahedron cannot be placed inside a unit cube, even though both are &quot;good&quot; (non-degenerate). Therefore, the answer is no.

But wait, the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, in this case, there exists a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped (both good) such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. Therefore, the answer is no.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that you can choose the orientation and position of the tetrahedron within the parallelepiped. But even so, if the tetrahedron is too large in some direction, it can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different setting where scaling is allowed, but the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling, so I think it&#x27;s not.

Wait, but the problem might be in a mathematical context where sizes are not considered, but only the combinatorial or topological aspects. But in standard geometry, size matters. So, unless specified otherwise, we have to consider size.

Therefore, based on the above reasoning, the answer should be no. However, let me verify once more.

Suppose we have a tetrahedron with a very long edge. Then, the minimal parallelepiped that can contain it must have at least one edge as long as the longest edge of the tetrahedron. If the given parallelepiped doesn&#x27;t have any edge as long as that, then the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Therefore, unless the parallelepiped is at least as large as the tetrahedron in all dimensions, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Since &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped includes ones that are smaller in some dimensions, the answer is no.

Therefore, the answer is no, it is not possible to place any good tetrahedron inside any good parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a different interpretation. Maybe the problem is in terms of combinatorial placement, like whether the vertices can be placed inside the parallelepiped regardless of the edges? But no, the tetrahedron is a solid, so all its points must be inside the parallelepiped.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about affine equivalence. But affine transformations can change the shape, but again, unless allowed, the answer remains no.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question. For example, since a tetrahedron can be decomposed into parallelepipeds or something? But that&#x27;s not standard.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that a tetrahedron can fit inside a parallelepiped if you can embed its vertices within the parallelepiped&#x27;s vertices, but that&#x27;s a different question. For example, a cube (a special case of a parallelepiped) can have a tetrahedron inscribed within it by connecting four of its vertices. But the problem is about any tetrahedron into any parallelepiped.

Wait, perhaps the key is that any tetrahedron can be affinely transformed into any other tetrahedron, but here we are dealing with a parallelepiped. If we can use affine transformations, then we can map a tetrahedron into a parallelepiped, but the problem states &quot;placed inside,&quot; which might not allow for such transformations.

Alternatively, consider that a parallelepiped can be divided into six tetrahedrons, each of which is similar to the others? Wait, no, not necessarily. A cube can be divided into six square pyramids, but that&#x27;s different.

Wait, perhaps the answer is yes, and I&#x27;m missing something. Let me think again.

Suppose we have any tetrahedron. Let&#x27;s consider its minimum bounding box. A bounding box is a parallelepiped (specifically, a rectangular prism if aligned with axes). Then, if we can show that any parallelepiped can contain any such bounding box, then the tetrahedron can be placed inside. But that&#x27;s not true because the bounding box&#x27;s dimensions depend on the tetrahedron, and the given parallelepiped might not have the required dimensions.

Alternatively, maybe by rotating the tetrahedron, we can fit it into a smaller parallelepiped? For example, the minimal volume parallelepiped enclosing a tetrahedron can be found by rotating the tetrahedron such that its edges align with the parallelepiped&#x27;s vectors. However, the volume of the minimal enclosing parallelepiped would depend on the tetrahedron&#x27;s geometry.

But the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, which might have a different orientation and size. So, even if the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal enclosing parallelepiped is smaller, the given parallelepiped might not have the right orientation or size.

Wait, perhaps if the parallelepiped is scaled such that it can contain the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal bounding parallelepiped. But the problem doesn&#x27;t allow scaling the parallelepiped. The parallelepiped is given, and we need to fit the tetrahedron inside it as is.

Alternatively, if the given parallelepiped is larger in all directions than the minimal bounding parallelepiped of the tetrahedron, then it can fit. But since the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, including smaller ones, the answer remains no.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a way to fold the tetrahedron into the parallelepiped? But in three-dimensional geometry, folding isn&#x27;t possible without tearing, so that&#x27;s not applicable.

Alternatively, using some projection or something? I don&#x27;t think so. To place a tetrahedron inside a parallelepiped, all its vertices must lie within the parallelepiped, and the edges must connect those vertices inside the parallelepiped. But if the parallelepiped is too small in some direction, the tetrahedron&#x27;s vertex coordinates would exceed the parallelepiped&#x27;s bounds in that direction.

Therefore, considering all this, the answer should be no. There exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of the parallelepiped cannot fit.

But maybe the problem uses &quot;good&quot; in a different way. Maybe a good tetrahedron is one that is contained within a unit cube, and a good parallelepiped is one that contains a unit cube? Then, perhaps any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. But that&#x27;s speculative. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Alternatively, if &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron has edges no longer than the edges of the parallelepiped. But again, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Therefore, given the problem as stated, with &quot;good&quot; meaning non-degenerate (positive volume), the answer is no. Because you can always find a tetrahedron too large to fit into a given parallelepiped, and a parallelepiped too small to contain a given tetrahedron.

Thus, the conclusion is that it&#x27;s not possible for any good tetrahedron to be placed inside any good parallelepiped. So, the answer is no.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped, we need to consider the definitions of &quot;good&quot; as non-degenerate, meaning both have positive volume. 

A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, and a parallelepiped is a three-dimensional figure formed by six parallelograms. The key points considered are:

1. **Volume Consideration**: A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors, while a parallelepiped&#x27;s volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its defining vectors. However, volume alone does not guarantee fitting one inside the other due to size constraints.
   
2. **Size and Shape Constraints**: A tetrahedron with a large volume or specific dimensions (e.g., long edge lengths) might not fit inside a parallelepiped with smaller dimensions. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of a parallelepiped cannot fit, regardless of rotation or translation.

3. **Rigid Transformations**: The problem implies placing the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped using only rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling. If a tetrahedron is too large in any dimension, it cannot fit inside a smaller parallelepiped even after rotation.

4. **Counterexamples**: Specific examples, such as a tetrahedron with a volume larger than the maximum volume that can fit inside a unit cube (which is \( \frac{1}{3} \)), demonstrate that it is not always possible to fit any tetrahedron inside any parallelepiped.

Given these considerations, it is concluded that there exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped due to size constraints. Therefore, the answer is:

Now, the problem mentions &quot;good&quot; tetrahedron and &quot;good&quot; parallelepiped. I wonder what makes them &quot;good&quot;? Maybe they have some specific properties? Let me check.

Wait, maybe &quot;good&quot; here means that the tetrahedron is non-degenerate, so it has a positive volume, and similarly, the parallelepiped is non-degenerate with all edges contributing to a positive volume. That makes sense. So, a good tetrahedron is one where the four vertices aren&#x27;t all coplanar, and a good parallelepiped is one where the three vectors defining it aren&#x27;t coplanar either. So, both have positive volume. Alright.

So, the question is: Given any tetrahedron with positive volume, can it fit inside any parallelepiped with positive volume? Hmm. That seems a bit general. Maybe I need to think about the dimensions. A parallelepiped is determined by three vectors, and its volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of those vectors. A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is 1/6 of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors from one vertex. So, maybe there&#x27;s a relationship there?

But wait, the tetrahedron and the parallelepiped could have different orientations. Maybe the issue is whether, regardless of how the tetrahedron is shaped, as long as it&#x27;s non-degenerate, there exists a way to position it inside any non-degenerate parallelepiped. But that seems too broad. For example, if the parallelepiped is very small, how can a tetrahedron with a certain volume fit inside it?

Wait, but maybe the problem is about whether the tetrahedron can be scaled or something? But the question says &quot;placed inside,&quot; which I think means without scaling. So, the original tetrahedron has to fit inside the parallelepiped as is. But then, if the parallelepiped is smaller in some dimensions, the tetrahedron might not fit. So maybe the answer is no?

But the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, regardless of the sizes, can you always fit one into the other? That seems unlikely. For example, if the parallelepiped is very &quot;flat,&quot; meaning one of its dimensions is very small, while the tetrahedron is quite &quot;tall&quot; in that dimension, then you couldn&#x27;t fit the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe &quot;good&quot; implies some additional constraints? Maybe all edges of the parallelepiped are of length at least some value, and the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges are bounded? Hmm, the problem statement just says &quot;good,&quot; which the user probably defines as non-degenerate. So, assuming positive volume for both. Then, the answer would depend on whether any tetrahedron, regardless of its shape and size, can fit inside any parallelepiped, regardless of its shape and size. Which is not possible because of scaling issues.

But maybe the problem allows for rotation and translation of the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped? So, if you can rotate the tetrahedron appropriately, maybe it can fit even if the parallelepiped is not aligned with the tetrahedron&#x27;s edges. But still, if the parallelepiped is smaller in all dimensions than the tetrahedron&#x27;s corresponding dimensions, even after rotation, it might not fit.

Wait, but how do we define the &quot;dimensions&quot; of a tetrahedron? A tetrahedron doesn&#x27;t have obvious length, width, and height like a box. Its size is more related to its edge lengths or its volume. Similarly, the parallelepiped has three edge vectors, so its &quot;size&quot; in different directions is determined by those vectors.

Maybe the key here is that given any tetrahedron, you can scale the parallelepiped to contain it, but the problem states &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so you can&#x27;t choose the parallelepiped&#x27;s size. Wait, no, the question is whether any tetrahedron can be placed inside any parallelepiped. So, given any tetrahedron and any parallelepiped, both non-degenerate, can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped? That seems impossible because you could have a very large tetrahedron and a very small parallelepiped.

But wait, maybe &quot;any&quot; here is in terms of shape, not size? Like, regardless of the proportions, but assuming they can be scaled? Wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling. So, I think the answer is no. For example, imagine a tetrahedron with edge lengths all equal to 1 meter, and a parallelepiped that&#x27;s 1 centimeter in each dimension. Clearly, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit inside. So, unless scaling is allowed, which the problem doesn&#x27;t state, the answer should be no.

But wait, maybe the problem is in a mathematical sense, where we can have any size as long as they are non-degenerate. But mathematically, size matters. If the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped, it can&#x27;t fit. So, unless there is a way to compress or expand, which isn&#x27;t mentioned, the answer is no.

But maybe the problem is considering that both are in some normalized form? For example, volume-wise. If both have unit volume, can any tetrahedron fit inside any parallelepiped? That might be a different question. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify normalization.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different context where &quot;good&quot; implies some other conditions. Wait, the user just said &quot;good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;good parallelepiped.&quot; Maybe in the context where &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron is such that it can fit into a unit cube, and the parallelepiped is also unit? But I need to go back to the original problem statement.

The original problem is: &quot;Determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, with the definitions of &quot;good&quot; being non-degenerate. So, each has positive volume. So, the question is: Given any two such shapes (tetrahedron and parallelepiped), can the tetrahedron fit inside the parallelepiped?

This seems like it&#x27;s asking if for all tetrahedrons T and for all parallelepipeds P (all non-degenerate), T can be placed inside P. Which is not true. For example, take a very &quot;large&quot; tetrahedron and a very &quot;small&quot; parallelepiped. The tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, maybe the question is reversed: Can any parallelepiped contain any tetrahedron? But still, no, because of size constraints.

But maybe the problem is in terms of similarity or something else. Wait, perhaps in terms of proportions rather than absolute size. For instance, regardless of the tetrahedron&#x27;s shape, there exists a parallelepiped with the same shape (up to scaling) that can contain it. But the problem says &quot;any good parallelepiped,&quot; so the parallelepiped is given, not chosen based on the tetrahedron.

Wait, maybe the problem is more about the geometric relations, like whether the tetrahedron can be embedded inside the parallelepiped through affine transformations. But affine transformations can scale, rotate, shear, etc. If you allow affine transformations, then any tetrahedron can be transformed into any other tetrahedron, but the problem is about placing inside a parallelepiped. If you can apply affine transformations to the tetrahedron, then you can certainly fit it inside any parallelepiped, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify if such transformations are allowed.

But the wording is &quot;placed inside,&quot; which usually in geometry problems means using rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling or shearing. So, if you can only translate and rotate the tetrahedron, then whether it can fit inside the parallelepiped depends on their relative sizes and shapes.

Therefore, if the tetrahedron is larger than the parallelepiped in some dimension, even after rotation, it can&#x27;t fit. For example, suppose the parallelepiped is a very thin rectangular prism (close to a flat box), and the tetrahedron is a regular tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the thickness of the prism. Then, no matter how you rotate the tetrahedron, its projection along the prism&#x27;s shortest axis would exceed the prism&#x27;s dimension in that axis. Hence, it can&#x27;t fit.

Therefore, the answer should be no. However, maybe there&#x27;s a different way to think about it. Let me consider specific examples.

Take a unit cube as the parallelepiped. Can any tetrahedron with, say, volume greater than 1/6 fit inside it? Wait, the maximum volume of a tetrahedron inside a cube is 1/3 (achieved by a corner tetrahedron). So, if a tetrahedron has a volume larger than 1/3, it can&#x27;t fit inside the cube. But the cube is a specific case of a parallelepiped. So, if I have a tetrahedron with volume larger than 1/3, then it can&#x27;t fit inside a unit cube. Therefore, such a tetrahedron cannot be placed inside a unit cube, even though both are &quot;good&quot; (non-degenerate). Therefore, the answer is no.

But wait, the problem says &quot;any good tetrahedron&quot; and &quot;any good parallelepiped.&quot; So, in this case, there exists a tetrahedron and a parallelepiped (both good) such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. Therefore, the answer is no.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that you can choose the orientation and position of the tetrahedron within the parallelepiped. But even so, if the tetrahedron is too large in some direction, it can&#x27;t fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in a different setting where scaling is allowed, but the problem doesn&#x27;t mention scaling, so I think it&#x27;s not.

Wait, but the problem might be in a mathematical context where sizes are not considered, but only the combinatorial or topological aspects. But in standard geometry, size matters. So, unless specified otherwise, we have to consider size.

Therefore, based on the above reasoning, the answer should be no. However, let me verify once more.

Suppose we have a tetrahedron with a very long edge. Then, the minimal parallelepiped that can contain it must have at least one edge as long as the longest edge of the tetrahedron. If the given parallelepiped doesn&#x27;t have any edge as long as that, then the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Therefore, unless the parallelepiped is at least as large as the tetrahedron in all dimensions, the tetrahedron can&#x27;t fit. Since &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped includes ones that are smaller in some dimensions, the answer is no.

Therefore, the answer is no, it is not possible to place any good tetrahedron inside any good parallelepiped.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a different interpretation. Maybe the problem is in terms of combinatorial placement, like whether the vertices can be placed inside the parallelepiped regardless of the edges? But no, the tetrahedron is a solid, so all its points must be inside the parallelepiped.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about affine equivalence. But affine transformations can change the shape, but again, unless allowed, the answer remains no.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question. For example, since a tetrahedron can be decomposed into parallelepipeds or something? But that&#x27;s not standard.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that a tetrahedron can fit inside a parallelepiped if you can embed its vertices within the parallelepiped&#x27;s vertices, but that&#x27;s a different question. For example, a cube (a special case of a parallelepiped) can have a tetrahedron inscribed within it by connecting four of its vertices. But the problem is about any tetrahedron into any parallelepiped.

Wait, perhaps the key is that any tetrahedron can be affinely transformed into any other tetrahedron, but here we are dealing with a parallelepiped. If we can use affine transformations, then we can map a tetrahedron into a parallelepiped, but the problem states &quot;placed inside,&quot; which might not allow for such transformations.

Alternatively, consider that a parallelepiped can be divided into six tetrahedrons, each of which is similar to the others? Wait, no, not necessarily. A cube can be divided into six square pyramids, but that&#x27;s different.

Wait, perhaps the answer is yes, and I&#x27;m missing something. Let me think again.

Suppose we have any tetrahedron. Let&#x27;s consider its minimum bounding box. A bounding box is a parallelepiped (specifically, a rectangular prism if aligned with axes). Then, if we can show that any parallelepiped can contain any such bounding box, then the tetrahedron can be placed inside. But that&#x27;s not true because the bounding box&#x27;s dimensions depend on the tetrahedron, and the given parallelepiped might not have the required dimensions.

Alternatively, maybe by rotating the tetrahedron, we can fit it into a smaller parallelepiped? For example, the minimal volume parallelepiped enclosing a tetrahedron can be found by rotating the tetrahedron such that its edges align with the parallelepiped&#x27;s vectors. However, the volume of the minimal enclosing parallelepiped would depend on the tetrahedron&#x27;s geometry.

But the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, which might have a different orientation and size. So, even if the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal enclosing parallelepiped is smaller, the given parallelepiped might not have the right orientation or size.

Wait, perhaps if the parallelepiped is scaled such that it can contain the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal bounding parallelepiped. But the problem doesn&#x27;t allow scaling the parallelepiped. The parallelepiped is given, and we need to fit the tetrahedron inside it as is.

Alternatively, if the given parallelepiped is larger in all directions than the minimal bounding parallelepiped of the tetrahedron, then it can fit. But since the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, including smaller ones, the answer remains no.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a way to fold the tetrahedron into the parallelepiped? But in three-dimensional geometry, folding isn&#x27;t possible without tearing, so that&#x27;s not applicable.

Alternatively, using some projection or something? I don&#x27;t think so. To place a tetrahedron inside a parallelepiped, all its vertices must lie within the parallelepiped, and the edges must connect those vertices inside the parallelepiped. But if the parallelepiped is too small in some direction, the tetrahedron&#x27;s vertex coordinates would exceed the parallelepiped&#x27;s bounds in that direction.

Therefore, considering all this, the answer should be no. There exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of the parallelepiped cannot fit.

But maybe the problem uses &quot;good&quot; in a different way. Maybe a good tetrahedron is one that is contained within a unit cube, and a good parallelepiped is one that contains a unit cube? Then, perhaps any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. But that&#x27;s speculative. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Alternatively, if &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron has edges no longer than the edges of the parallelepiped. But again, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Therefore, given the problem as stated, with &quot;good&quot; meaning non-degenerate (positive volume), the answer is no. Because you can always find a tetrahedron too large to fit into a given parallelepiped, and a parallelepiped too small to contain a given tetrahedron.

Thus, the conclusion is that it&#x27;s not possible for any good tetrahedron to be placed inside any good parallelepiped. So, the answer is no.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped, we need to consider the definitions of &quot;good&quot; as non-degenerate, meaning both have positive volume. 

A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, and a parallelepiped is a three-dimensional figure formed by six parallelograms. The key points considered are:

1. **Volume Consideration**: A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors, while a parallelepiped&#x27;s volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its defining vectors. However, volume alone does not guarantee fitting one inside the other due to size constraints.
   
2. **Size and Shape Constraints**: A tetrahedron with a large volume or specific dimensions (e.g., long edge lengths) might not fit inside a parallelepiped with smaller dimensions. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of a parallelepiped cannot fit, regardless of rotation or translation.

3. **Rigid Transformations**: The problem implies placing the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped using only rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling. If a tetrahedron is too large in any dimension, it cannot fit inside a smaller parallelepiped even after rotation.

4. **Counterexamples**: Specific examples, such as a tetrahedron with a volume larger than the maximum volume that can fit inside a unit cube (which is \( \frac{1}{3} \)), demonstrate that it is not always possible to fit any tetrahedron inside any parallelepiped.

Given these considerations, it is concluded that there exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped due to size constraints. Therefore, the answer is:

But the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, which might have a different orientation and size. So, even if the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal enclosing parallelepiped is smaller, the given parallelepiped might not have the right orientation or size.

Wait, perhaps if the parallelepiped is scaled such that it can contain the tetrahedron&#x27;s minimal bounding parallelepiped. But the problem doesn&#x27;t allow scaling the parallelepiped. The parallelepiped is given, and we need to fit the tetrahedron inside it as is.

Alternatively, if the given parallelepiped is larger in all directions than the minimal bounding parallelepiped of the tetrahedron, then it can fit. But since the problem states &quot;any&quot; parallelepiped, including smaller ones, the answer remains no.

Wait, but maybe there&#x27;s a way to fold the tetrahedron into the parallelepiped? But in three-dimensional geometry, folding isn&#x27;t possible without tearing, so that&#x27;s not applicable.

Alternatively, using some projection or something? I don&#x27;t think so. To place a tetrahedron inside a parallelepiped, all its vertices must lie within the parallelepiped, and the edges must connect those vertices inside the parallelepiped. But if the parallelepiped is too small in some direction, the tetrahedron&#x27;s vertex coordinates would exceed the parallelepiped&#x27;s bounds in that direction.

Therefore, considering all this, the answer should be no. There exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of the parallelepiped cannot fit.

But maybe the problem uses &quot;good&quot; in a different way. Maybe a good tetrahedron is one that is contained within a unit cube, and a good parallelepiped is one that contains a unit cube? Then, perhaps any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped. But that&#x27;s speculative. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Alternatively, if &quot;good&quot; means that the tetrahedron has edges no longer than the edges of the parallelepiped. But again, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify this.

Therefore, given the problem as stated, with &quot;good&quot; meaning non-degenerate (positive volume), the answer is no. Because you can always find a tetrahedron too large to fit into a given parallelepiped, and a parallelepiped too small to contain a given tetrahedron.

Thus, the conclusion is that it&#x27;s not possible for any good tetrahedron to be placed inside any good parallelepiped. So, the answer is no.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether any good tetrahedron can be placed inside any good parallelepiped, we need to consider the definitions of &quot;good&quot; as non-degenerate, meaning both have positive volume. 

A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces, and a parallelepiped is a three-dimensional figure formed by six parallelograms. The key points considered are:

1. **Volume Consideration**: A tetrahedron&#x27;s volume is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its edge vectors, while a parallelepiped&#x27;s volume is the absolute value of the scalar triple product of its defining vectors. However, volume alone does not guarantee fitting one inside the other due to size constraints.
   
2. **Size and Shape Constraints**: A tetrahedron with a large volume or specific dimensions (e.g., long edge lengths) might not fit inside a parallelepiped with smaller dimensions. For example, a tetrahedron with edge lengths longer than the corresponding edges of a parallelepiped cannot fit, regardless of rotation or translation.

3. **Rigid Transformations**: The problem implies placing the tetrahedron inside the parallelepiped using only rigid transformations (translations and rotations), not scaling. If a tetrahedron is too large in any dimension, it cannot fit inside a smaller parallelepiped even after rotation.

4. **Counterexamples**: Specific examples, such as a tetrahedron with a volume larger than the maximum volume that can fit inside a unit cube (which is \( \frac{1}{3} \)), demonstrate that it is not always possible to fit any tetrahedron inside any parallelepiped.

Given these considerations, it is concluded that there exist good tetrahedrons and good parallelepipeds such that the tetrahedron cannot be placed inside the parallelepiped due to size constraints. Therefore, the answer is:
