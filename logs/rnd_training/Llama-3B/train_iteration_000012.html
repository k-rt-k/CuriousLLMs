Response: Yes, such an $x$ exists, because $P$ is orthogonal. \boxed{Yes}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem: Given an orthogonal matrix P in R^{n x n}, does there exist a vector x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries? Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall what an orthogonal matrix is. An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix whose columns and rows are orthonormal vectors. That means P^T P = I, where P^T is the transpose of P and I is the identity matrix. So, the inverse of P is just its transpose. Orthogonal matrices preserve the dot product, so they preserve angles and lengths. That means transformations like rotations and reflections are orthogonal.

Now, the question is about whether there&#x27;s a vector x with all non-zero entries such that when we multiply it by P, the resulting vector also has all non-zero entries. So, both x and Px must have no zeros in any of their components. 

Let me rephrase the problem: We need to find a vector x in R^n with all entries non-zero such that none of the entries of Px are zero. Alternatively, for each row of P, the dot product with x is non-zero. So, for each row vector p_i of P, p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0. So, the problem reduces to finding an x with all entries non-zero that is not orthogonal to any of the rows of P.

Since P is orthogonal, its rows form an orthonormal basis for R^n. So, the rows are unit vectors and mutually orthogonal. But we need a vector x that is not orthogonal to any of these rows. So, x cannot be orthogonal to any row of P.

But is such an x guaranteed to exist? Hmm. Let me think. In R^n, given a finite set of vectors (in this case, n orthonormal vectors), does there exist a vector that is not orthogonal to any of them?

Alternatively, the question is: Can we find a vector x such that for each i from 1 to n, the inner product of x with the i-th row of P is not zero. Since the rows are orthonormal, they form a basis. So, x can be expressed in terms of this basis. But x is in R^n, so any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the rows. Wait, but the rows themselves are orthonormal, so if we express x as a combination of the rows, then the coefficients would just be the inner products of x with each row. But if we require that all those coefficients are non-zero, then x must have a non-zero component in each row direction. So, in other words, if we write x = c_1 p_1 + c_2 p_2 + ... + c_n p_n, where p_i are the rows of P, then all c_i must be non-zero. But since the rows of P form a basis, any x can be written this way, and we can choose the coefficients c_i to be non-zero. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, but hold on. If we set x to be the sum of all the rows with coefficients 1, then x = p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n, and then Px would be... Wait, no, P is the matrix whose rows are p_i, so multiplying P by x would give us a vector where each component is p_i ⋅ x. But if x is the sum of all p_j, then p_i ⋅ x = p_i ⋅ (p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n) = p_i ⋅ p_i + sum_{j ≠ i} p_i ⋅ p_j. Since the rows are orthonormal, p_i ⋅ p_j = δ_{ij}, so this simplifies to 1 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1. So, Px would be a vector of all ones. Therefore, in that case, x = p_1 + ... + p_n would have Px = (1,1,...,1)^T, which has no zero entries. But wait, does x itself have non-zero entries? Not necessarily. If the sum of the rows of P results in a vector with all non-zero entries, then we&#x27;re done. But maybe in some cases, the sum of the rows could have a zero entry. For example, if P is a permutation matrix, say swapping two coordinates, then the sum of the rows would be (1,1), which in higher dimensions might still have all entries non-zero? Wait, no, a permutation matrix in higher dimensions just permutes the entries. So, if you sum all the rows of a permutation matrix, you would get a vector of all ones, right? Because each row has a single 1 and the rest zeros, and summing all rows would give a vector with n ones. So, in that case, x would be the vector of all ones, which has no zero entries, and Px would also be the vector of all ones, since permutation matrices just permute the entries. Wait, no. If x is all ones, then Px would permute the entries of x, which are all ones, so Px would still be all ones. So, in that case, both x and Px have all entries non-zero.

But wait, this seems too specific. What if P is a different orthogonal matrix? For example, suppose P is a rotation matrix in 2D. Let&#x27;s take n=2. Then, a rotation matrix is orthogonal. Suppose we have a rotation by some angle θ. Then, is there a vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries?

Well, let&#x27;s take x = (1,1). Then, Px would be (cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ). Are there θ such that either component is zero? For example, if θ = 45 degrees, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. Then, Px would be (0, √2). So, the first component is zero. Oh, so in this case, x = (1,1) would result in Px having a zero entry. But does there exist another x with no zero entries such that Px also has none?

Suppose we take x = (a, b) with a, b ≠ 0. Then, Px = (a cosθ - b sinθ, a sinθ + b cosθ). For this to have no zeros, we need a cosθ - b sinθ ≠ 0 and a sinθ + b cosθ ≠ 0.

So, can we choose a and b such that these are satisfied? Let&#x27;s see. If θ is 45 degrees, as above, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. So, the first component becomes (a - b)√2/2 and the second component becomes (a + b)√2/2. So, to have both components non-zero, we need a ≠ b and a ≠ -b. So, as long as a ≠ b and a ≠ -b, then x = (a, b) would work. For example, take a = 1, b = 2. Then, both components are non-zero. So, even though x = (1,1) leads to a zero in the first component, another x with non-zero entries can work.

Therefore, in 2D, even if the rotation matrix can map some non-zero vectors to ones with zeros, there still exist vectors with no zero entries that are mapped to vectors with no zero entries. So, maybe in general, such vectors exist?

Alternatively, maybe we can use a density argument. The set of vectors with no zero entries is dense in R^n. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also dense, since it&#x27;s the complement of the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P. Since the union of hyperplanes has measure zero, their complement is dense. Therefore, the intersection of these two sets (vectors with no zero entries such that Px also has none) is also dense, hence non-empty.

Wait, that might be a more abstract way to see it. Let me elaborate. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the coordinate hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. Each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is a closed set with empty interior. Similarly, the set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}, where p_i are the rows of P. Again, each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is closed with empty interior. Therefore, both complements are open and dense in R^n. The intersection of two open dense sets is also open and dense, hence non-empty. Therefore, there must exist vectors x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, since the rows of P form an orthonormal basis, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are n distinct hyperplanes. The set of vectors not lying in any of these hyperplanes is the complement of their union, which is dense. Similarly, the set of vectors with no zero entries is the complement of the union of coordinate hyperplanes, also dense. The intersection of these two dense sets is non-empty by the Baire Category Theorem, which states that in a complete metric space (like R^n), the intersection of countably many dense open sets is dense. Since we&#x27;re dealing with finite unions of hyperplanes, the complements are open and dense, so their intersection is dense, hence non-empty.

Therefore, such a vector x must exist. Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector exists.

Wait, but let me test this with a specific example. Suppose P is the identity matrix. Then, the rows are the standard basis vectors. So, the hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. The set of vectors with no zero entries is exactly the complement of the union of these hyperplanes. So, in this case, the vectors x with no zero entries are exactly those for which Px (which is x itself) has no zero entries. So, in this case, the two conditions are the same, so the intersection is the same set, which is non-empty. So, works here.

Another example: Let P be a permutation matrix. Then, as before, x with all non-zero entries will be permuted, so Px will have the same entries as x but in different order. Therefore, Px will also have no zero entries. Therefore, in this case, any x with no zero entries works. So, definitely exists.

Another example: Take P to be a rotation matrix in 3D. Suppose we rotate around some axis. Then, similar to the 2D case, can we find a vector x with all non-zero entries such that Px also has all non-zero entries? Let&#x27;s see. Let’s take x = (1,1,1). If we rotate x by some angle, the result might not have any zero entries, depending on the rotation. But even if it does, we can perturb x slightly to avoid zeros. For example, if rotating x = (1,1,1) by 90 degrees around the z-axis gives ( -1, 1, 1), which still has no zeros. Wait, but a 90 degree rotation around z-axis would send (x, y, z) to (-y, x, z). So, x = (1,1,1) becomes (-1, 1, 1), which indeed has no zeros. So in this case, it works. But maybe another rotation could cause a zero? Suppose we have a rotation that aligns a vector with an axis. Wait, but if we rotate a vector with all non-zero entries, would it ever result in a zero? For example, rotating (1,1,1) around some axis by some angle. If the rotation is such that one component becomes zero, then that would require that vector to be orthogonal to one of the coordinate axes, but (1,1,1) is not orthogonal to any coordinate axis unless we have specific rotations. Wait, but actually, any rotation is an orthogonal transformation, but to get a zero component, you would need the rotated vector to lie on a coordinate hyperplane. However, if the original vector is not on any rotated hyperplane corresponding to the coordinate axes, then the rotated vector won&#x27;t have zeros. But perhaps this is too vague.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider specific angles. Suppose we rotate (1,1,1) by 45 degrees around some axis. Depending on the axis, this might or might not introduce zeros. But maybe choosing an axis that isn&#x27;t aligned with the coordinate axes. For example, rotating around the vector (1,1,1) itself by some angle. Then, the vector (1,1,1) would remain unchanged, so no zeros. If we rotate around another axis, say (1,0,0), by 45 degrees. Then, the rotation in the y-z plane. The x-component remains 1, and y and z components become (y cosθ - z sinθ, y sinθ + z cosθ). So, with θ = 45 degrees, y and z components become ( (y - z)/√2, (y + z)/√2 ). If original x is (1,1,1), then after rotation, it becomes (1, (1 - 1)/√2 = 0, (1 + 1)/√2 = √2 ). So, the y-component becomes zero. Oh, so in this case, rotating (1,1,1) around the x-axis by 45 degrees results in a vector with a zero entry. But then, does that mean that for this particular rotation matrix, the vector x = (1,1,1) leads to Px having a zero? But the question is whether there exists some x with no zero entries such that Px also has none. In this case, even though (1,1,1) doesn&#x27;t work, maybe another vector does. For example, take x = (1, 2, 1). Then, rotating around x-axis by 45 degrees gives (1, (2 - 1)/√2, (2 + 1)/√2 ) = (1, 1/√2, 3/√2 ), which has no zeros. So, yes, such a vector exists. So even if some vectors lead to zeros after transformation, others don&#x27;t.

This seems to support the idea that regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, we can always find such a vector x. The key idea is that the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P and the coordinate hyperplanes have measure zero, so their complements intersect.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the set S of vectors x with no zero entries. This is an open set in R^n (since it&#x27;s the complement of the closed set where at least one coordinate is zero). Similarly, the set T of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open, as it&#x27;s the complement of the union of hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}. Since P is orthogonal, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are distinct from the coordinate hyperplanes if P is not a permutation matrix. But even if they overlap, the important thing is that both S and T are open and dense. The intersection of two open dense sets is non-empty in R^n, as R^n is a Baire space. Therefore, S ∩ T ≠ ∅, meaning there exists a vector x in both S and T, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of linear algebra, suppose we want to find x such that x_i ≠ 0 for all i, and (Px)_j ≠ 0 for all j. Let me try to construct such an x. Since P is invertible (orthogonal matrices are invertible), the mapping x ↦ Px is a bijection. Therefore, the image of the set S (vectors with no zero entries) under P is the same as the set T. Since S is open and dense, and P is a homeomorphism (continuous bijection with continuous inverse), then T = P(S) is also open and dense. Therefore, T ∩ S is the intersection of two open dense sets, which must be non-empty. Therefore, there exists x in S such that Px is also in S, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, this seems like a solid argument. Since S is open and dense, and T = P(S) is also open and dense, their intersection is non-empty. Therefore, yes, such an x exists.

But let me check if this reasoning holds. If S is the set of vectors with no zero entries, and T is the set of vectors y such that y = Px has no zero entries, which is equivalent to x = P^T y having no zero entries? Wait, no. T is the set of x such that Px has no zero entries. So, T = {x | Px ∈ S}. Since P is invertible, T = P^{-1}(S). Since S is open and dense, and P^{-1} is a homeomorphism, T is also open and dense. Therefore, S and T are both open and dense, so their intersection is non-empty.

Therefore, there exists x ∈ S ∩ T, which means x has no zero entries, and Px also has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector x exists.

But let me see if I can construct such a vector explicitly. Suppose we take a vector x with all entries equal to 1. Then, Px is the sum of the columns of P. Wait, no, if x is all ones, then Px is the sum of the columns of P scaled by 1. But the columns of P are orthonormal. The sum of the columns of P would be a vector whose norm squared is n, since each column is a unit vector and they are orthogonal. So, the sum would have norm sqrt(n). But does the sum have any zero entries? Not necessarily. For example, if P is the identity matrix, then the sum is (1,1,...,1), which has no zeros. If P is a permutation matrix, the sum is also (1,1,...,1). If P is a rotation matrix, the sum could be different. For instance, in 2D, if P is a rotation by θ, then the sum of the columns would be [cosθ + (-sinθ), sinθ + cosθ], which is [cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ]. For θ = 45 degrees, this becomes [0, √2], which has a zero. So, in that case, x being all ones would result in Px having a zero. But as we saw before, if we take x = (1, 2), then Px might not have any zeros. So, the all-ones vector might not work, but another vector might.

Alternatively, maybe a vector with all entries positive. Since if all entries are positive, then Px is a linear combination of the columns of P with positive coefficients. But the columns of P are orthonormal, so they form a basis. If all coefficients are positive, can such a combination result in a zero entry? Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a vector x with all positive entries such that Px has a zero entry. Then, the zero entry corresponds to a row of P (since Px is computed by row-wise dot products). So, there exists a row p_i of P such that p_i ⋅ x = 0. But x has all positive entries, and p_i is a unit vector. However, the dot product being zero would mean that p_i is orthogonal to x. But since x is in the positive orthant, and p_i is a unit vector, is it possible for p_i to be orthogonal to x?

Yes, it&#x27;s possible. For example, take p_i = (1, -1, 0, ..., 0)/sqrt(2). Then, the dot product with x = (1,1,1,...,1) would be (1 - 1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + ... + 0 = 0. So, even with x having all positive entries, p_i ⋅ x can be zero. Therefore, just having positive entries is not sufficient. But the question is whether there exists some x with all non-zero entries (not necessarily all positive) such that p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0 for all i.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the function f(x) = (Px)_1 * (Px)_2 * ... * (Px)_n * x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_n. We need to find x such that f(x) ≠ 0. Since f is the product of all entries of Px and all entries of x, it&#x27;s a polynomial in the entries of x. The set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the hyperplanes {x_i = 0} and {p_i ⋅ x = 0} for each i. Since we are in R^n, and the zero set of a non-zero polynomial has measure zero, but f is the product of 2n linear terms, which is a non-zero polynomial. Wait, but actually, f(x) is the product of n terms from Px and n terms from x, so total degree 2n. However, the set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the 2n hyperplanes. But since these hyperplanes are all of codimension 1, their union is a closed set with empty interior. Therefore, the complement, where f(x) ≠ 0, is open and dense. Therefore, there exist vectors x where f(x) ≠ 0, which means all entries of x and all entries of Px are non-zero. Hence, such vectors exist.

This again confirms that the answer is yes.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for each row p_i of P, the hyperplane p_i ⋅ x = 0 does not contain any of the coordinate hyperplanes x_j = 0, unless p_i is aligned with some coordinate axis. But since P is orthogonal, if any row p_i were aligned with a coordinate axis, then the corresponding column would also be that axis vector, making P a permutation matrix (possibly with sign changes). But even if P is a permutation matrix with sign changes (i.e., generalized permutation matrix), then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 correspond to x_j = 0 for some j, depending on the permutation and sign. However, in such a case, avoiding those hyperplanes would correspond to avoiding certain coordinate hyperplanes. But if P is a generalized permutation matrix, then Px is just a permutation of x with possible sign changes. Therefore, if we choose x with all entries non-zero, then Px will also have all entries non-zero, since permutation and sign changes don&#x27;t introduce zeros. Therefore, in that case, any x with no zero entries works. 

If P is not a generalized permutation matrix, then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 are not coordinate hyperplanes, so the union of these hyperplanes and the coordinate hyperplanes is a union of 2n distinct hyperplanes (assuming no overlap). However, even if there is overlap, the key point is that the union is a closed set with empty interior, so the complement is open and dense. Therefore, regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, the existence of such an x is guaranteed.

To summarize:

1. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is open and dense.
2. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open and dense.
3. The intersection of these two sets is non-empty due to the Baire Category Theorem.
4. Therefore, there must exist at least one vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Therefore, the answer is yes, such a vector x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given an orthogonal matrix \( P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \), we need to determine whether there exists a vector \( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \) with no zero entries such that \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

1. **Orthogonal Matrix Properties**: An orthogonal matrix \( P \) has orthonormal rows and columns, meaning \( P^T P = I \). This implies that the rows of \( P \) form an orthonormal basis for \( \mathbb{R}^n \).

2. **Hyperplanes Consideration**: We need a vector \( x \) such that both \( x \) and \( Px \) have no zero entries. This translates to finding \( x \) such that \( x \) is not orthogonal to any row of \( P \), i.e., \( p_i \cdot x \neq 0 \) for all rows \( p_i \) of \( P \).

3. **Dense Sets Argument**: 
   - The set of vectors with no zero entries (complement of coordinate hyperplanes) is open and dense in \( \mathbb{R}^n \).
   - The set of vectors \( x \) such that \( Px \) has no zero entries (complement of hyperplanes orthogonal to rows of \( P \)) is also open and dense.

4. **Intersection of Dense Sets**: By the Baire Category Theorem, the intersection of two open dense sets in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) is non-empty. Therefore, there exists a vector \( x \) that lies in both sets, meaning \( x \) has no zero entries and \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

5. **Conclusion**: The existence of such a vector \( x \) is guaranteed by the density and openness arguments, confirming that the required vector exists for any orthogonal matrix \( P \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem: Given an orthogonal matrix P in R^{n x n}, does there exist a vector x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries? Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall what an orthogonal matrix is. An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix whose columns and rows are orthonormal vectors. That means P^T P = I, where P^T is the transpose of P and I is the identity matrix. So, the inverse of P is just its transpose. Orthogonal matrices preserve the dot product, so they preserve angles and lengths. That means transformations like rotations and reflections are orthogonal.

Now, the question is about whether there&#x27;s a vector x with all non-zero entries such that when we multiply it by P, the resulting vector also has all non-zero entries. So, both x and Px must have no zeros in any of their components. 

Let me rephrase the problem: We need to find a vector x in R^n with all entries non-zero such that none of the entries of Px are zero. Alternatively, for each row of P, the dot product with x is non-zero. So, for each row vector p_i of P, p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0. So, the problem reduces to finding an x with all entries non-zero that is not orthogonal to any of the rows of P.

Since P is orthogonal, its rows form an orthonormal basis for R^n. So, the rows are unit vectors and mutually orthogonal. But we need a vector x that is not orthogonal to any of these rows. So, x cannot be orthogonal to any row of P.

But is such an x guaranteed to exist? Hmm. Let me think. In R^n, given a finite set of vectors (in this case, n orthonormal vectors), does there exist a vector that is not orthogonal to any of them?

Alternatively, the question is: Can we find a vector x such that for each i from 1 to n, the inner product of x with the i-th row of P is not zero. Since the rows are orthonormal, they form a basis. So, x can be expressed in terms of this basis. But x is in R^n, so any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the rows. Wait, but the rows themselves are orthonormal, so if we express x as a combination of the rows, then the coefficients would just be the inner products of x with each row. But if we require that all those coefficients are non-zero, then x must have a non-zero component in each row direction. So, in other words, if we write x = c_1 p_1 + c_2 p_2 + ... + c_n p_n, where p_i are the rows of P, then all c_i must be non-zero. But since the rows of P form a basis, any x can be written this way, and we can choose the coefficients c_i to be non-zero. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, but hold on. If we set x to be the sum of all the rows with coefficients 1, then x = p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n, and then Px would be... Wait, no, P is the matrix whose rows are p_i, so multiplying P by x would give us a vector where each component is p_i ⋅ x. But if x is the sum of all p_j, then p_i ⋅ x = p_i ⋅ (p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n) = p_i ⋅ p_i + sum_{j ≠ i} p_i ⋅ p_j. Since the rows are orthonormal, p_i ⋅ p_j = δ_{ij}, so this simplifies to 1 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1. So, Px would be a vector of all ones. Therefore, in that case, x = p_1 + ... + p_n would have Px = (1,1,...,1)^T, which has no zero entries. But wait, does x itself have non-zero entries? Not necessarily. If the sum of the rows of P results in a vector with all non-zero entries, then we&#x27;re done. But maybe in some cases, the sum of the rows could have a zero entry. For example, if P is a permutation matrix, say swapping two coordinates, then the sum of the rows would be (1,1), which in higher dimensions might still have all entries non-zero? Wait, no, a permutation matrix in higher dimensions just permutes the entries. So, if you sum all the rows of a permutation matrix, you would get a vector of all ones, right? Because each row has a single 1 and the rest zeros, and summing all rows would give a vector with n ones. So, in that case, x would be the vector of all ones, which has no zero entries, and Px would also be the vector of all ones, since permutation matrices just permute the entries. Wait, no. If x is all ones, then Px would permute the entries of x, which are all ones, so Px would still be all ones. So, in that case, both x and Px have all entries non-zero.

But wait, this seems too specific. What if P is a different orthogonal matrix? For example, suppose P is a rotation matrix in 2D. Let&#x27;s take n=2. Then, a rotation matrix is orthogonal. Suppose we have a rotation by some angle θ. Then, is there a vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries?

Well, let&#x27;s take x = (1,1). Then, Px would be (cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ). Are there θ such that either component is zero? For example, if θ = 45 degrees, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. Then, Px would be (0, √2). So, the first component is zero. Oh, so in this case, x = (1,1) would result in Px having a zero entry. But does there exist another x with no zero entries such that Px also has none?

Suppose we take x = (a, b) with a, b ≠ 0. Then, Px = (a cosθ - b sinθ, a sinθ + b cosθ). For this to have no zeros, we need a cosθ - b sinθ ≠ 0 and a sinθ + b cosθ ≠ 0.

So, can we choose a and b such that these are satisfied? Let&#x27;s see. If θ is 45 degrees, as above, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. So, the first component becomes (a - b)√2/2 and the second component becomes (a + b)√2/2. So, to have both components non-zero, we need a ≠ b and a ≠ -b. So, as long as a ≠ b and a ≠ -b, then x = (a, b) would work. For example, take a = 1, b = 2. Then, both components are non-zero. So, even though x = (1,1) leads to a zero in the first component, another x with non-zero entries can work.

Therefore, in 2D, even if the rotation matrix can map some non-zero vectors to ones with zeros, there still exist vectors with no zero entries that are mapped to vectors with no zero entries. So, maybe in general, such vectors exist?

Alternatively, maybe we can use a density argument. The set of vectors with no zero entries is dense in R^n. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also dense, since it&#x27;s the complement of the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P. Since the union of hyperplanes has measure zero, their complement is dense. Therefore, the intersection of these two sets (vectors with no zero entries such that Px also has none) is also dense, hence non-empty.

Wait, that might be a more abstract way to see it. Let me elaborate. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the coordinate hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. Each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is a closed set with empty interior. Similarly, the set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}, where p_i are the rows of P. Again, each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is closed with empty interior. Therefore, both complements are open and dense in R^n. The intersection of two open dense sets is also open and dense, hence non-empty. Therefore, there must exist vectors x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, since the rows of P form an orthonormal basis, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are n distinct hyperplanes. The set of vectors not lying in any of these hyperplanes is the complement of their union, which is dense. Similarly, the set of vectors with no zero entries is the complement of the union of coordinate hyperplanes, also dense. The intersection of these two dense sets is non-empty by the Baire Category Theorem, which states that in a complete metric space (like R^n), the intersection of countably many dense open sets is dense. Since we&#x27;re dealing with finite unions of hyperplanes, the complements are open and dense, so their intersection is dense, hence non-empty.

Therefore, such a vector x must exist. Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector exists.

Wait, but let me test this with a specific example. Suppose P is the identity matrix. Then, the rows are the standard basis vectors. So, the hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. The set of vectors with no zero entries is exactly the complement of the union of these hyperplanes. So, in this case, the vectors x with no zero entries are exactly those for which Px (which is x itself) has no zero entries. So, in this case, the two conditions are the same, so the intersection is the same set, which is non-empty. So, works here.

Another example: Let P be a permutation matrix. Then, as before, x with all non-zero entries will be permuted, so Px will have the same entries as x but in different order. Therefore, Px will also have no zero entries. Therefore, in this case, any x with no zero entries works. So, definitely exists.

Another example: Take P to be a rotation matrix in 3D. Suppose we rotate around some axis. Then, similar to the 2D case, can we find a vector x with all non-zero entries such that Px also has all non-zero entries? Let&#x27;s see. Let’s take x = (1,1,1). If we rotate x by some angle, the result might not have any zero entries, depending on the rotation. But even if it does, we can perturb x slightly to avoid zeros. For example, if rotating x = (1,1,1) by 90 degrees around the z-axis gives ( -1, 1, 1), which still has no zeros. Wait, but a 90 degree rotation around z-axis would send (x, y, z) to (-y, x, z). So, x = (1,1,1) becomes (-1, 1, 1), which indeed has no zeros. So in this case, it works. But maybe another rotation could cause a zero? Suppose we have a rotation that aligns a vector with an axis. Wait, but if we rotate a vector with all non-zero entries, would it ever result in a zero? For example, rotating (1,1,1) around some axis by some angle. If the rotation is such that one component becomes zero, then that would require that vector to be orthogonal to one of the coordinate axes, but (1,1,1) is not orthogonal to any coordinate axis unless we have specific rotations. Wait, but actually, any rotation is an orthogonal transformation, but to get a zero component, you would need the rotated vector to lie on a coordinate hyperplane. However, if the original vector is not on any rotated hyperplane corresponding to the coordinate axes, then the rotated vector won&#x27;t have zeros. But perhaps this is too vague.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider specific angles. Suppose we rotate (1,1,1) by 45 degrees around some axis. Depending on the axis, this might or might not introduce zeros. But maybe choosing an axis that isn&#x27;t aligned with the coordinate axes. For example, rotating around the vector (1,1,1) itself by some angle. Then, the vector (1,1,1) would remain unchanged, so no zeros. If we rotate around another axis, say (1,0,0), by 45 degrees. Then, the rotation in the y-z plane. The x-component remains 1, and y and z components become (y cosθ - z sinθ, y sinθ + z cosθ). So, with θ = 45 degrees, y and z components become ( (y - z)/√2, (y + z)/√2 ). If original x is (1,1,1), then after rotation, it becomes (1, (1 - 1)/√2 = 0, (1 + 1)/√2 = √2 ). So, the y-component becomes zero. Oh, so in this case, rotating (1,1,1) around the x-axis by 45 degrees results in a vector with a zero entry. But then, does that mean that for this particular rotation matrix, the vector x = (1,1,1) leads to Px having a zero? But the question is whether there exists some x with no zero entries such that Px also has none. In this case, even though (1,1,1) doesn&#x27;t work, maybe another vector does. For example, take x = (1, 2, 1). Then, rotating around x-axis by 45 degrees gives (1, (2 - 1)/√2, (2 + 1)/√2 ) = (1, 1/√2, 3/√2 ), which has no zeros. So, yes, such a vector exists. So even if some vectors lead to zeros after transformation, others don&#x27;t.

This seems to support the idea that regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, we can always find such a vector x. The key idea is that the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P and the coordinate hyperplanes have measure zero, so their complements intersect.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the set S of vectors x with no zero entries. This is an open set in R^n (since it&#x27;s the complement of the closed set where at least one coordinate is zero). Similarly, the set T of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open, as it&#x27;s the complement of the union of hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}. Since P is orthogonal, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are distinct from the coordinate hyperplanes if P is not a permutation matrix. But even if they overlap, the important thing is that both S and T are open and dense. The intersection of two open dense sets is non-empty in R^n, as R^n is a Baire space. Therefore, S ∩ T ≠ ∅, meaning there exists a vector x in both S and T, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of linear algebra, suppose we want to find x such that x_i ≠ 0 for all i, and (Px)_j ≠ 0 for all j. Let me try to construct such an x. Since P is invertible (orthogonal matrices are invertible), the mapping x ↦ Px is a bijection. Therefore, the image of the set S (vectors with no zero entries) under P is the same as the set T. Since S is open and dense, and P is a homeomorphism (continuous bijection with continuous inverse), then T = P(S) is also open and dense. Therefore, T ∩ S is the intersection of two open dense sets, which must be non-empty. Therefore, there exists x in S such that Px is also in S, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, this seems like a solid argument. Since S is open and dense, and T = P(S) is also open and dense, their intersection is non-empty. Therefore, yes, such an x exists.

But let me check if this reasoning holds. If S is the set of vectors with no zero entries, and T is the set of vectors y such that y = Px has no zero entries, which is equivalent to x = P^T y having no zero entries? Wait, no. T is the set of x such that Px has no zero entries. So, T = {x | Px ∈ S}. Since P is invertible, T = P^{-1}(S). Since S is open and dense, and P^{-1} is a homeomorphism, T is also open and dense. Therefore, S and T are both open and dense, so their intersection is non-empty.

Therefore, there exists x ∈ S ∩ T, which means x has no zero entries, and Px also has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector x exists.

But let me see if I can construct such a vector explicitly. Suppose we take a vector x with all entries equal to 1. Then, Px is the sum of the columns of P. Wait, no, if x is all ones, then Px is the sum of the columns of P scaled by 1. But the columns of P are orthonormal. The sum of the columns of P would be a vector whose norm squared is n, since each column is a unit vector and they are orthogonal. So, the sum would have norm sqrt(n). But does the sum have any zero entries? Not necessarily. For example, if P is the identity matrix, then the sum is (1,1,...,1), which has no zeros. If P is a permutation matrix, the sum is also (1,1,...,1). If P is a rotation matrix, the sum could be different. For instance, in 2D, if P is a rotation by θ, then the sum of the columns would be [cosθ + (-sinθ), sinθ + cosθ], which is [cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ]. For θ = 45 degrees, this becomes [0, √2], which has a zero. So, in that case, x being all ones would result in Px having a zero. But as we saw before, if we take x = (1, 2), then Px might not have any zeros. So, the all-ones vector might not work, but another vector might.

Alternatively, maybe a vector with all entries positive. Since if all entries are positive, then Px is a linear combination of the columns of P with positive coefficients. But the columns of P are orthonormal, so they form a basis. If all coefficients are positive, can such a combination result in a zero entry? Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a vector x with all positive entries such that Px has a zero entry. Then, the zero entry corresponds to a row of P (since Px is computed by row-wise dot products). So, there exists a row p_i of P such that p_i ⋅ x = 0. But x has all positive entries, and p_i is a unit vector. However, the dot product being zero would mean that p_i is orthogonal to x. But since x is in the positive orthant, and p_i is a unit vector, is it possible for p_i to be orthogonal to x?

Yes, it&#x27;s possible. For example, take p_i = (1, -1, 0, ..., 0)/sqrt(2). Then, the dot product with x = (1,1,1,...,1) would be (1 - 1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + ... + 0 = 0. So, even with x having all positive entries, p_i ⋅ x can be zero. Therefore, just having positive entries is not sufficient. But the question is whether there exists some x with all non-zero entries (not necessarily all positive) such that p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0 for all i.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the function f(x) = (Px)_1 * (Px)_2 * ... * (Px)_n * x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_n. We need to find x such that f(x) ≠ 0. Since f is the product of all entries of Px and all entries of x, it&#x27;s a polynomial in the entries of x. The set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the hyperplanes {x_i = 0} and {p_i ⋅ x = 0} for each i. Since we are in R^n, and the zero set of a non-zero polynomial has measure zero, but f is the product of 2n linear terms, which is a non-zero polynomial. Wait, but actually, f(x) is the product of n terms from Px and n terms from x, so total degree 2n. However, the set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the 2n hyperplanes. But since these hyperplanes are all of codimension 1, their union is a closed set with empty interior. Therefore, the complement, where f(x) ≠ 0, is open and dense. Therefore, there exist vectors x where f(x) ≠ 0, which means all entries of x and all entries of Px are non-zero. Hence, such vectors exist.

This again confirms that the answer is yes.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for each row p_i of P, the hyperplane p_i ⋅ x = 0 does not contain any of the coordinate hyperplanes x_j = 0, unless p_i is aligned with some coordinate axis. But since P is orthogonal, if any row p_i were aligned with a coordinate axis, then the corresponding column would also be that axis vector, making P a permutation matrix (possibly with sign changes). But even if P is a permutation matrix with sign changes (i.e., generalized permutation matrix), then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 correspond to x_j = 0 for some j, depending on the permutation and sign. However, in such a case, avoiding those hyperplanes would correspond to avoiding certain coordinate hyperplanes. But if P is a generalized permutation matrix, then Px is just a permutation of x with possible sign changes. Therefore, if we choose x with all entries non-zero, then Px will also have all entries non-zero, since permutation and sign changes don&#x27;t introduce zeros. Therefore, in that case, any x with no zero entries works. 

If P is not a generalized permutation matrix, then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 are not coordinate hyperplanes, so the union of these hyperplanes and the coordinate hyperplanes is a union of 2n distinct hyperplanes (assuming no overlap). However, even if there is overlap, the key point is that the union is a closed set with empty interior, so the complement is open and dense. Therefore, regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, the existence of such an x is guaranteed.

To summarize:

1. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is open and dense.
2. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open and dense.
3. The intersection of these two sets is non-empty due to the Baire Category Theorem.
4. Therefore, there must exist at least one vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Therefore, the answer is yes, such a vector x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given an orthogonal matrix \( P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \), we need to determine whether there exists a vector \( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \) with no zero entries such that \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

1. **Orthogonal Matrix Properties**: An orthogonal matrix \( P \) has orthonormal rows and columns, meaning \( P^T P = I \). This implies that the rows of \( P \) form an orthonormal basis for \( \mathbb{R}^n \).

2. **Hyperplanes Consideration**: We need a vector \( x \) such that both \( x \) and \( Px \) have no zero entries. This translates to finding \( x \) such that \( x \) is not orthogonal to any row of \( P \), i.e., \( p_i \cdot x \neq 0 \) for all rows \( p_i \) of \( P \).

3. **Dense Sets Argument**: 
   - The set of vectors with no zero entries (complement of coordinate hyperplanes) is open and dense in \( \mathbb{R}^n \).
   - The set of vectors \( x \) such that \( Px \) has no zero entries (complement of hyperplanes orthogonal to rows of \( P \)) is also open and dense.

4. **Intersection of Dense Sets**: By the Baire Category Theorem, the intersection of two open dense sets in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) is non-empty. Therefore, there exists a vector \( x \) that lies in both sets, meaning \( x \) has no zero entries and \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

5. **Conclusion**: The existence of such a vector \( x \) is guaranteed by the density and openness arguments, confirming that the required vector exists for any orthogonal matrix \( P \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem: Given an orthogonal matrix P in R^{n x n}, does there exist a vector x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries? Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall what an orthogonal matrix is. An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix whose columns and rows are orthonormal vectors. That means P^T P = I, where P^T is the transpose of P and I is the identity matrix. So, the inverse of P is just its transpose. Orthogonal matrices preserve the dot product, so they preserve angles and lengths. That means transformations like rotations and reflections are orthogonal.

Now, the question is about whether there&#x27;s a vector x with all non-zero entries such that when we multiply it by P, the resulting vector also has all non-zero entries. So, both x and Px must have no zeros in any of their components. 

Let me rephrase the problem: We need to find a vector x in R^n with all entries non-zero such that none of the entries of Px are zero. Alternatively, for each row of P, the dot product with x is non-zero. So, for each row vector p_i of P, p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0. So, the problem reduces to finding an x with all entries non-zero that is not orthogonal to any of the rows of P.

Since P is orthogonal, its rows form an orthonormal basis for R^n. So, the rows are unit vectors and mutually orthogonal. But we need a vector x that is not orthogonal to any of these rows. So, x cannot be orthogonal to any row of P.

But is such an x guaranteed to exist? Hmm. Let me think. In R^n, given a finite set of vectors (in this case, n orthonormal vectors), does there exist a vector that is not orthogonal to any of them?

Alternatively, the question is: Can we find a vector x such that for each i from 1 to n, the inner product of x with the i-th row of P is not zero. Since the rows are orthonormal, they form a basis. So, x can be expressed in terms of this basis. But x is in R^n, so any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the rows. Wait, but the rows themselves are orthonormal, so if we express x as a combination of the rows, then the coefficients would just be the inner products of x with each row. But if we require that all those coefficients are non-zero, then x must have a non-zero component in each row direction. So, in other words, if we write x = c_1 p_1 + c_2 p_2 + ... + c_n p_n, where p_i are the rows of P, then all c_i must be non-zero. But since the rows of P form a basis, any x can be written this way, and we can choose the coefficients c_i to be non-zero. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, but hold on. If we set x to be the sum of all the rows with coefficients 1, then x = p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n, and then Px would be... Wait, no, P is the matrix whose rows are p_i, so multiplying P by x would give us a vector where each component is p_i ⋅ x. But if x is the sum of all p_j, then p_i ⋅ x = p_i ⋅ (p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n) = p_i ⋅ p_i + sum_{j ≠ i} p_i ⋅ p_j. Since the rows are orthonormal, p_i ⋅ p_j = δ_{ij}, so this simplifies to 1 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1. So, Px would be a vector of all ones. Therefore, in that case, x = p_1 + ... + p_n would have Px = (1,1,...,1)^T, which has no zero entries. But wait, does x itself have non-zero entries? Not necessarily. If the sum of the rows of P results in a vector with all non-zero entries, then we&#x27;re done. But maybe in some cases, the sum of the rows could have a zero entry. For example, if P is a permutation matrix, say swapping two coordinates, then the sum of the rows would be (1,1), which in higher dimensions might still have all entries non-zero? Wait, no, a permutation matrix in higher dimensions just permutes the entries. So, if you sum all the rows of a permutation matrix, you would get a vector of all ones, right? Because each row has a single 1 and the rest zeros, and summing all rows would give a vector with n ones. So, in that case, x would be the vector of all ones, which has no zero entries, and Px would also be the vector of all ones, since permutation matrices just permute the entries. Wait, no. If x is all ones, then Px would permute the entries of x, which are all ones, so Px would still be all ones. So, in that case, both x and Px have all entries non-zero.

But wait, this seems too specific. What if P is a different orthogonal matrix? For example, suppose P is a rotation matrix in 2D. Let&#x27;s take n=2. Then, a rotation matrix is orthogonal. Suppose we have a rotation by some angle θ. Then, is there a vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries?

Well, let&#x27;s take x = (1,1). Then, Px would be (cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ). Are there θ such that either component is zero? For example, if θ = 45 degrees, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. Then, Px would be (0, √2). So, the first component is zero. Oh, so in this case, x = (1,1) would result in Px having a zero entry. But does there exist another x with no zero entries such that Px also has none?

Suppose we take x = (a, b) with a, b ≠ 0. Then, Px = (a cosθ - b sinθ, a sinθ + b cosθ). For this to have no zeros, we need a cosθ - b sinθ ≠ 0 and a sinθ + b cosθ ≠ 0.

So, can we choose a and b such that these are satisfied? Let&#x27;s see. If θ is 45 degrees, as above, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. So, the first component becomes (a - b)√2/2 and the second component becomes (a + b)√2/2. So, to have both components non-zero, we need a ≠ b and a ≠ -b. So, as long as a ≠ b and a ≠ -b, then x = (a, b) would work. For example, take a = 1, b = 2. Then, both components are non-zero. So, even though x = (1,1) leads to a zero in the first component, another x with non-zero entries can work.

Therefore, in 2D, even if the rotation matrix can map some non-zero vectors to ones with zeros, there still exist vectors with no zero entries that are mapped to vectors with no zero entries. So, maybe in general, such vectors exist?

Alternatively, maybe we can use a density argument. The set of vectors with no zero entries is dense in R^n. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also dense, since it&#x27;s the complement of the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P. Since the union of hyperplanes has measure zero, their complement is dense. Therefore, the intersection of these two sets (vectors with no zero entries such that Px also has none) is also dense, hence non-empty.

Wait, that might be a more abstract way to see it. Let me elaborate. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the coordinate hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. Each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is a closed set with empty interior. Similarly, the set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}, where p_i are the rows of P. Again, each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is closed with empty interior. Therefore, both complements are open and dense in R^n. The intersection of two open dense sets is also open and dense, hence non-empty. Therefore, there must exist vectors x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, since the rows of P form an orthonormal basis, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are n distinct hyperplanes. The set of vectors not lying in any of these hyperplanes is the complement of their union, which is dense. Similarly, the set of vectors with no zero entries is the complement of the union of coordinate hyperplanes, also dense. The intersection of these two dense sets is non-empty by the Baire Category Theorem, which states that in a complete metric space (like R^n), the intersection of countably many dense open sets is dense. Since we&#x27;re dealing with finite unions of hyperplanes, the complements are open and dense, so their intersection is dense, hence non-empty.

Therefore, such a vector x must exist. Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector exists.

Wait, but let me test this with a specific example. Suppose P is the identity matrix. Then, the rows are the standard basis vectors. So, the hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. The set of vectors with no zero entries is exactly the complement of the union of these hyperplanes. So, in this case, the vectors x with no zero entries are exactly those for which Px (which is x itself) has no zero entries. So, in this case, the two conditions are the same, so the intersection is the same set, which is non-empty. So, works here.

Another example: Let P be a permutation matrix. Then, as before, x with all non-zero entries will be permuted, so Px will have the same entries as x but in different order. Therefore, Px will also have no zero entries. Therefore, in this case, any x with no zero entries works. So, definitely exists.

Another example: Take P to be a rotation matrix in 3D. Suppose we rotate around some axis. Then, similar to the 2D case, can we find a vector x with all non-zero entries such that Px also has all non-zero entries? Let&#x27;s see. Let’s take x = (1,1,1). If we rotate x by some angle, the result might not have any zero entries, depending on the rotation. But even if it does, we can perturb x slightly to avoid zeros. For example, if rotating x = (1,1,1) by 90 degrees around the z-axis gives ( -1, 1, 1), which still has no zeros. Wait, but a 90 degree rotation around z-axis would send (x, y, z) to (-y, x, z). So, x = (1,1,1) becomes (-1, 1, 1), which indeed has no zeros. So in this case, it works. But maybe another rotation could cause a zero? Suppose we have a rotation that aligns a vector with an axis. Wait, but if we rotate a vector with all non-zero entries, would it ever result in a zero? For example, rotating (1,1,1) around some axis by some angle. If the rotation is such that one component becomes zero, then that would require that vector to be orthogonal to one of the coordinate axes, but (1,1,1) is not orthogonal to any coordinate axis unless we have specific rotations. Wait, but actually, any rotation is an orthogonal transformation, but to get a zero component, you would need the rotated vector to lie on a coordinate hyperplane. However, if the original vector is not on any rotated hyperplane corresponding to the coordinate axes, then the rotated vector won&#x27;t have zeros. But perhaps this is too vague.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider specific angles. Suppose we rotate (1,1,1) by 45 degrees around some axis. Depending on the axis, this might or might not introduce zeros. But maybe choosing an axis that isn&#x27;t aligned with the coordinate axes. For example, rotating around the vector (1,1,1) itself by some angle. Then, the vector (1,1,1) would remain unchanged, so no zeros. If we rotate around another axis, say (1,0,0), by 45 degrees. Then, the rotation in the y-z plane. The x-component remains 1, and y and z components become (y cosθ - z sinθ, y sinθ + z cosθ). So, with θ = 45 degrees, y and z components become ( (y - z)/√2, (y + z)/√2 ). If original x is (1,1,1), then after rotation, it becomes (1, (1 - 1)/√2 = 0, (1 + 1)/√2 = √2 ). So, the y-component becomes zero. Oh, so in this case, rotating (1,1,1) around the x-axis by 45 degrees results in a vector with a zero entry. But then, does that mean that for this particular rotation matrix, the vector x = (1,1,1) leads to Px having a zero? But the question is whether there exists some x with no zero entries such that Px also has none. In this case, even though (1,1,1) doesn&#x27;t work, maybe another vector does. For example, take x = (1, 2, 1). Then, rotating around x-axis by 45 degrees gives (1, (2 - 1)/√2, (2 + 1)/√2 ) = (1, 1/√2, 3/√2 ), which has no zeros. So, yes, such a vector exists. So even if some vectors lead to zeros after transformation, others don&#x27;t.

This seems to support the idea that regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, we can always find such a vector x. The key idea is that the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P and the coordinate hyperplanes have measure zero, so their complements intersect.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the set S of vectors x with no zero entries. This is an open set in R^n (since it&#x27;s the complement of the closed set where at least one coordinate is zero). Similarly, the set T of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open, as it&#x27;s the complement of the union of hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}. Since P is orthogonal, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are distinct from the coordinate hyperplanes if P is not a permutation matrix. But even if they overlap, the important thing is that both S and T are open and dense. The intersection of two open dense sets is non-empty in R^n, as R^n is a Baire space. Therefore, S ∩ T ≠ ∅, meaning there exists a vector x in both S and T, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of linear algebra, suppose we want to find x such that x_i ≠ 0 for all i, and (Px)_j ≠ 0 for all j. Let me try to construct such an x. Since P is invertible (orthogonal matrices are invertible), the mapping x ↦ Px is a bijection. Therefore, the image of the set S (vectors with no zero entries) under P is the same as the set T. Since S is open and dense, and P is a homeomorphism (continuous bijection with continuous inverse), then T = P(S) is also open and dense. Therefore, T ∩ S is the intersection of two open dense sets, which must be non-empty. Therefore, there exists x in S such that Px is also in S, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, this seems like a solid argument. Since S is open and dense, and T = P(S) is also open and dense, their intersection is non-empty. Therefore, yes, such an x exists.

But let me check if this reasoning holds. If S is the set of vectors with no zero entries, and T is the set of vectors y such that y = Px has no zero entries, which is equivalent to x = P^T y having no zero entries? Wait, no. T is the set of x such that Px has no zero entries. So, T = {x | Px ∈ S}. Since P is invertible, T = P^{-1}(S). Since S is open and dense, and P^{-1} is a homeomorphism, T is also open and dense. Therefore, S and T are both open and dense, so their intersection is non-empty.

Therefore, there exists x ∈ S ∩ T, which means x has no zero entries, and Px also has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector x exists.

But let me see if I can construct such a vector explicitly. Suppose we take a vector x with all entries equal to 1. Then, Px is the sum of the columns of P. Wait, no, if x is all ones, then Px is the sum of the columns of P scaled by 1. But the columns of P are orthonormal. The sum of the columns of P would be a vector whose norm squared is n, since each column is a unit vector and they are orthogonal. So, the sum would have norm sqrt(n). But does the sum have any zero entries? Not necessarily. For example, if P is the identity matrix, then the sum is (1,1,...,1), which has no zeros. If P is a permutation matrix, the sum is also (1,1,...,1). If P is a rotation matrix, the sum could be different. For instance, in 2D, if P is a rotation by θ, then the sum of the columns would be [cosθ + (-sinθ), sinθ + cosθ], which is [cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ]. For θ = 45 degrees, this becomes [0, √2], which has a zero. So, in that case, x being all ones would result in Px having a zero. But as we saw before, if we take x = (1, 2), then Px might not have any zeros. So, the all-ones vector might not work, but another vector might.

Alternatively, maybe a vector with all entries positive. Since if all entries are positive, then Px is a linear combination of the columns of P with positive coefficients. But the columns of P are orthonormal, so they form a basis. If all coefficients are positive, can such a combination result in a zero entry? Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a vector x with all positive entries such that Px has a zero entry. Then, the zero entry corresponds to a row of P (since Px is computed by row-wise dot products). So, there exists a row p_i of P such that p_i ⋅ x = 0. But x has all positive entries, and p_i is a unit vector. However, the dot product being zero would mean that p_i is orthogonal to x. But since x is in the positive orthant, and p_i is a unit vector, is it possible for p_i to be orthogonal to x?

Yes, it&#x27;s possible. For example, take p_i = (1, -1, 0, ..., 0)/sqrt(2). Then, the dot product with x = (1,1,1,...,1) would be (1 - 1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + ... + 0 = 0. So, even with x having all positive entries, p_i ⋅ x can be zero. Therefore, just having positive entries is not sufficient. But the question is whether there exists some x with all non-zero entries (not necessarily all positive) such that p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0 for all i.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the function f(x) = (Px)_1 * (Px)_2 * ... * (Px)_n * x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_n. We need to find x such that f(x) ≠ 0. Since f is the product of all entries of Px and all entries of x, it&#x27;s a polynomial in the entries of x. The set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the hyperplanes {x_i = 0} and {p_i ⋅ x = 0} for each i. Since we are in R^n, and the zero set of a non-zero polynomial has measure zero, but f is the product of 2n linear terms, which is a non-zero polynomial. Wait, but actually, f(x) is the product of n terms from Px and n terms from x, so total degree 2n. However, the set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the 2n hyperplanes. But since these hyperplanes are all of codimension 1, their union is a closed set with empty interior. Therefore, the complement, where f(x) ≠ 0, is open and dense. Therefore, there exist vectors x where f(x) ≠ 0, which means all entries of x and all entries of Px are non-zero. Hence, such vectors exist.

This again confirms that the answer is yes.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for each row p_i of P, the hyperplane p_i ⋅ x = 0 does not contain any of the coordinate hyperplanes x_j = 0, unless p_i is aligned with some coordinate axis. But since P is orthogonal, if any row p_i were aligned with a coordinate axis, then the corresponding column would also be that axis vector, making P a permutation matrix (possibly with sign changes). But even if P is a permutation matrix with sign changes (i.e., generalized permutation matrix), then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 correspond to x_j = 0 for some j, depending on the permutation and sign. However, in such a case, avoiding those hyperplanes would correspond to avoiding certain coordinate hyperplanes. But if P is a generalized permutation matrix, then Px is just a permutation of x with possible sign changes. Therefore, if we choose x with all entries non-zero, then Px will also have all entries non-zero, since permutation and sign changes don&#x27;t introduce zeros. Therefore, in that case, any x with no zero entries works. 

If P is not a generalized permutation matrix, then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 are not coordinate hyperplanes, so the union of these hyperplanes and the coordinate hyperplanes is a union of 2n distinct hyperplanes (assuming no overlap). However, even if there is overlap, the key point is that the union is a closed set with empty interior, so the complement is open and dense. Therefore, regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, the existence of such an x is guaranteed.

To summarize:

1. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is open and dense.
2. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open and dense.
3. The intersection of these two sets is non-empty due to the Baire Category Theorem.
4. Therefore, there must exist at least one vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Therefore, the answer is yes, such a vector x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given an orthogonal matrix \( P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \), we need to determine whether there exists a vector \( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \) with no zero entries such that \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

1. **Orthogonal Matrix Properties**: An orthogonal matrix \( P \) has orthonormal rows and columns, meaning \( P^T P = I \). This implies that the rows of \( P \) form an orthonormal basis for \( \mathbb{R}^n \).

2. **Hyperplanes Consideration**: We need a vector \( x \) such that both \( x \) and \( Px \) have no zero entries. This translates to finding \( x \) such that \( x \) is not orthogonal to any row of \( P \), i.e., \( p_i \cdot x \neq 0 \) for all rows \( p_i \) of \( P \).

3. **Dense Sets Argument**: 
   - The set of vectors with no zero entries (complement of coordinate hyperplanes) is open and dense in \( \mathbb{R}^n \).
   - The set of vectors \( x \) such that \( Px \) has no zero entries (complement of hyperplanes orthogonal to rows of \( P \)) is also open and dense.

4. **Intersection of Dense Sets**: By the Baire Category Theorem, the intersection of two open dense sets in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) is non-empty. Therefore, there exists a vector \( x \) that lies in both sets, meaning \( x \) has no zero entries and \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

5. **Conclusion**: The existence of such a vector \( x \) is guaranteed by the density and openness arguments, confirming that the required vector exists for any orthogonal matrix \( P \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem: Given an orthogonal matrix P in R^{n x n}, does there exist a vector x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries? Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall what an orthogonal matrix is. An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix whose columns and rows are orthonormal vectors. That means P^T P = I, where P^T is the transpose of P and I is the identity matrix. So, the inverse of P is just its transpose. Orthogonal matrices preserve the dot product, so they preserve angles and lengths. That means transformations like rotations and reflections are orthogonal.

Now, the question is about whether there&#x27;s a vector x with all non-zero entries such that when we multiply it by P, the resulting vector also has all non-zero entries. So, both x and Px must have no zeros in any of their components. 

Let me rephrase the problem: We need to find a vector x in R^n with all entries non-zero such that none of the entries of Px are zero. Alternatively, for each row of P, the dot product with x is non-zero. So, for each row vector p_i of P, p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0. So, the problem reduces to finding an x with all entries non-zero that is not orthogonal to any of the rows of P.

Since P is orthogonal, its rows form an orthonormal basis for R^n. So, the rows are unit vectors and mutually orthogonal. But we need a vector x that is not orthogonal to any of these rows. So, x cannot be orthogonal to any row of P.

But is such an x guaranteed to exist? Hmm. Let me think. In R^n, given a finite set of vectors (in this case, n orthonormal vectors), does there exist a vector that is not orthogonal to any of them?

Alternatively, the question is: Can we find a vector x such that for each i from 1 to n, the inner product of x with the i-th row of P is not zero. Since the rows are orthonormal, they form a basis. So, x can be expressed in terms of this basis. But x is in R^n, so any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the rows. Wait, but the rows themselves are orthonormal, so if we express x as a combination of the rows, then the coefficients would just be the inner products of x with each row. But if we require that all those coefficients are non-zero, then x must have a non-zero component in each row direction. So, in other words, if we write x = c_1 p_1 + c_2 p_2 + ... + c_n p_n, where p_i are the rows of P, then all c_i must be non-zero. But since the rows of P form a basis, any x can be written this way, and we can choose the coefficients c_i to be non-zero. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, but hold on. If we set x to be the sum of all the rows with coefficients 1, then x = p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n, and then Px would be... Wait, no, P is the matrix whose rows are p_i, so multiplying P by x would give us a vector where each component is p_i ⋅ x. But if x is the sum of all p_j, then p_i ⋅ x = p_i ⋅ (p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n) = p_i ⋅ p_i + sum_{j ≠ i} p_i ⋅ p_j. Since the rows are orthonormal, p_i ⋅ p_j = δ_{ij}, so this simplifies to 1 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1. So, Px would be a vector of all ones. Therefore, in that case, x = p_1 + ... + p_n would have Px = (1,1,...,1)^T, which has no zero entries. But wait, does x itself have non-zero entries? Not necessarily. If the sum of the rows of P results in a vector with all non-zero entries, then we&#x27;re done. But maybe in some cases, the sum of the rows could have a zero entry. For example, if P is a permutation matrix, say swapping two coordinates, then the sum of the rows would be (1,1), which in higher dimensions might still have all entries non-zero? Wait, no, a permutation matrix in higher dimensions just permutes the entries. So, if you sum all the rows of a permutation matrix, you would get a vector of all ones, right? Because each row has a single 1 and the rest zeros, and summing all rows would give a vector with n ones. So, in that case, x would be the vector of all ones, which has no zero entries, and Px would also be the vector of all ones, since permutation matrices just permute the entries. Wait, no. If x is all ones, then Px would permute the entries of x, which are all ones, so Px would still be all ones. So, in that case, both x and Px have all entries non-zero.

But wait, this seems too specific. What if P is a different orthogonal matrix? For example, suppose P is a rotation matrix in 2D. Let&#x27;s take n=2. Then, a rotation matrix is orthogonal. Suppose we have a rotation by some angle θ. Then, is there a vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries?

Well, let&#x27;s take x = (1,1). Then, Px would be (cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ). Are there θ such that either component is zero? For example, if θ = 45 degrees, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. Then, Px would be (0, √2). So, the first component is zero. Oh, so in this case, x = (1,1) would result in Px having a zero entry. But does there exist another x with no zero entries such that Px also has none?

Suppose we take x = (a, b) with a, b ≠ 0. Then, Px = (a cosθ - b sinθ, a sinθ + b cosθ). For this to have no zeros, we need a cosθ - b sinθ ≠ 0 and a sinθ + b cosθ ≠ 0.

So, can we choose a and b such that these are satisfied? Let&#x27;s see. If θ is 45 degrees, as above, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. So, the first component becomes (a - b)√2/2 and the second component becomes (a + b)√2/2. So, to have both components non-zero, we need a ≠ b and a ≠ -b. So, as long as a ≠ b and a ≠ -b, then x = (a, b) would work. For example, take a = 1, b = 2. Then, both components are non-zero. So, even though x = (1,1) leads to a zero in the first component, another x with non-zero entries can work.

Therefore, in 2D, even if the rotation matrix can map some non-zero vectors to ones with zeros, there still exist vectors with no zero entries that are mapped to vectors with no zero entries. So, maybe in general, such vectors exist?

Alternatively, maybe we can use a density argument. The set of vectors with no zero entries is dense in R^n. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also dense, since it&#x27;s the complement of the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P. Since the union of hyperplanes has measure zero, their complement is dense. Therefore, the intersection of these two sets (vectors with no zero entries such that Px also has none) is also dense, hence non-empty.

Wait, that might be a more abstract way to see it. Let me elaborate. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the coordinate hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. Each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is a closed set with empty interior. Similarly, the set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}, where p_i are the rows of P. Again, each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is closed with empty interior. Therefore, both complements are open and dense in R^n. The intersection of two open dense sets is also open and dense, hence non-empty. Therefore, there must exist vectors x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, since the rows of P form an orthonormal basis, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are n distinct hyperplanes. The set of vectors not lying in any of these hyperplanes is the complement of their union, which is dense. Similarly, the set of vectors with no zero entries is the complement of the union of coordinate hyperplanes, also dense. The intersection of these two dense sets is non-empty by the Baire Category Theorem, which states that in a complete metric space (like R^n), the intersection of countably many dense open sets is dense. Since we&#x27;re dealing with finite unions of hyperplanes, the complements are open and dense, so their intersection is dense, hence non-empty.

Therefore, such a vector x must exist. Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector exists.

Wait, but let me test this with a specific example. Suppose P is the identity matrix. Then, the rows are the standard basis vectors. So, the hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. The set of vectors with no zero entries is exactly the complement of the union of these hyperplanes. So, in this case, the vectors x with no zero entries are exactly those for which Px (which is x itself) has no zero entries. So, in this case, the two conditions are the same, so the intersection is the same set, which is non-empty. So, works here.

Another example: Let P be a permutation matrix. Then, as before, x with all non-zero entries will be permuted, so Px will have the same entries as x but in different order. Therefore, Px will also have no zero entries. Therefore, in this case, any x with no zero entries works. So, definitely exists.

Another example: Take P to be a rotation matrix in 3D. Suppose we rotate around some axis. Then, similar to the 2D case, can we find a vector x with all non-zero entries such that Px also has all non-zero entries? Let&#x27;s see. Let’s take x = (1,1,1). If we rotate x by some angle, the result might not have any zero entries, depending on the rotation. But even if it does, we can perturb x slightly to avoid zeros. For example, if rotating x = (1,1,1) by 90 degrees around the z-axis gives ( -1, 1, 1), which still has no zeros. Wait, but a 90 degree rotation around z-axis would send (x, y, z) to (-y, x, z). So, x = (1,1,1) becomes (-1, 1, 1), which indeed has no zeros. So in this case, it works. But maybe another rotation could cause a zero? Suppose we have a rotation that aligns a vector with an axis. Wait, but if we rotate a vector with all non-zero entries, would it ever result in a zero? For example, rotating (1,1,1) around some axis by some angle. If the rotation is such that one component becomes zero, then that would require that vector to be orthogonal to one of the coordinate axes, but (1,1,1) is not orthogonal to any coordinate axis unless we have specific rotations. Wait, but actually, any rotation is an orthogonal transformation, but to get a zero component, you would need the rotated vector to lie on a coordinate hyperplane. However, if the original vector is not on any rotated hyperplane corresponding to the coordinate axes, then the rotated vector won&#x27;t have zeros. But perhaps this is too vague.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider specific angles. Suppose we rotate (1,1,1) by 45 degrees around some axis. Depending on the axis, this might or might not introduce zeros. But maybe choosing an axis that isn&#x27;t aligned with the coordinate axes. For example, rotating around the vector (1,1,1) itself by some angle. Then, the vector (1,1,1) would remain unchanged, so no zeros. If we rotate around another axis, say (1,0,0), by 45 degrees. Then, the rotation in the y-z plane. The x-component remains 1, and y and z components become (y cosθ - z sinθ, y sinθ + z cosθ). So, with θ = 45 degrees, y and z components become ( (y - z)/√2, (y + z)/√2 ). If original x is (1,1,1), then after rotation, it becomes (1, (1 - 1)/√2 = 0, (1 + 1)/√2 = √2 ). So, the y-component becomes zero. Oh, so in this case, rotating (1,1,1) around the x-axis by 45 degrees results in a vector with a zero entry. But then, does that mean that for this particular rotation matrix, the vector x = (1,1,1) leads to Px having a zero? But the question is whether there exists some x with no zero entries such that Px also has none. In this case, even though (1,1,1) doesn&#x27;t work, maybe another vector does. For example, take x = (1, 2, 1). Then, rotating around x-axis by 45 degrees gives (1, (2 - 1)/√2, (2 + 1)/√2 ) = (1, 1/√2, 3/√2 ), which has no zeros. So, yes, such a vector exists. So even if some vectors lead to zeros after transformation, others don&#x27;t.

This seems to support the idea that regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, we can always find such a vector x. The key idea is that the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P and the coordinate hyperplanes have measure zero, so their complements intersect.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the set S of vectors x with no zero entries. This is an open set in R^n (since it&#x27;s the complement of the closed set where at least one coordinate is zero). Similarly, the set T of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open, as it&#x27;s the complement of the union of hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}. Since P is orthogonal, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are distinct from the coordinate hyperplanes if P is not a permutation matrix. But even if they overlap, the important thing is that both S and T are open and dense. The intersection of two open dense sets is non-empty in R^n, as R^n is a Baire space. Therefore, S ∩ T ≠ ∅, meaning there exists a vector x in both S and T, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of linear algebra, suppose we want to find x such that x_i ≠ 0 for all i, and (Px)_j ≠ 0 for all j. Let me try to construct such an x. Since P is invertible (orthogonal matrices are invertible), the mapping x ↦ Px is a bijection. Therefore, the image of the set S (vectors with no zero entries) under P is the same as the set T. Since S is open and dense, and P is a homeomorphism (continuous bijection with continuous inverse), then T = P(S) is also open and dense. Therefore, T ∩ S is the intersection of two open dense sets, which must be non-empty. Therefore, there exists x in S such that Px is also in S, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, this seems like a solid argument. Since S is open and dense, and T = P(S) is also open and dense, their intersection is non-empty. Therefore, yes, such an x exists.

But let me check if this reasoning holds. If S is the set of vectors with no zero entries, and T is the set of vectors y such that y = Px has no zero entries, which is equivalent to x = P^T y having no zero entries? Wait, no. T is the set of x such that Px has no zero entries. So, T = {x | Px ∈ S}. Since P is invertible, T = P^{-1}(S). Since S is open and dense, and P^{-1} is a homeomorphism, T is also open and dense. Therefore, S and T are both open and dense, so their intersection is non-empty.

Therefore, there exists x ∈ S ∩ T, which means x has no zero entries, and Px also has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector x exists.

But let me see if I can construct such a vector explicitly. Suppose we take a vector x with all entries equal to 1. Then, Px is the sum of the columns of P. Wait, no, if x is all ones, then Px is the sum of the columns of P scaled by 1. But the columns of P are orthonormal. The sum of the columns of P would be a vector whose norm squared is n, since each column is a unit vector and they are orthogonal. So, the sum would have norm sqrt(n). But does the sum have any zero entries? Not necessarily. For example, if P is the identity matrix, then the sum is (1,1,...,1), which has no zeros. If P is a permutation matrix, the sum is also (1,1,...,1). If P is a rotation matrix, the sum could be different. For instance, in 2D, if P is a rotation by θ, then the sum of the columns would be [cosθ + (-sinθ), sinθ + cosθ], which is [cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ]. For θ = 45 degrees, this becomes [0, √2], which has a zero. So, in that case, x being all ones would result in Px having a zero. But as we saw before, if we take x = (1, 2), then Px might not have any zeros. So, the all-ones vector might not work, but another vector might.

Alternatively, maybe a vector with all entries positive. Since if all entries are positive, then Px is a linear combination of the columns of P with positive coefficients. But the columns of P are orthonormal, so they form a basis. If all coefficients are positive, can such a combination result in a zero entry? Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a vector x with all positive entries such that Px has a zero entry. Then, the zero entry corresponds to a row of P (since Px is computed by row-wise dot products). So, there exists a row p_i of P such that p_i ⋅ x = 0. But x has all positive entries, and p_i is a unit vector. However, the dot product being zero would mean that p_i is orthogonal to x. But since x is in the positive orthant, and p_i is a unit vector, is it possible for p_i to be orthogonal to x?

Yes, it&#x27;s possible. For example, take p_i = (1, -1, 0, ..., 0)/sqrt(2). Then, the dot product with x = (1,1,1,...,1) would be (1 - 1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + ... + 0 = 0. So, even with x having all positive entries, p_i ⋅ x can be zero. Therefore, just having positive entries is not sufficient. But the question is whether there exists some x with all non-zero entries (not necessarily all positive) such that p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0 for all i.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the function f(x) = (Px)_1 * (Px)_2 * ... * (Px)_n * x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_n. We need to find x such that f(x) ≠ 0. Since f is the product of all entries of Px and all entries of x, it&#x27;s a polynomial in the entries of x. The set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the hyperplanes {x_i = 0} and {p_i ⋅ x = 0} for each i. Since we are in R^n, and the zero set of a non-zero polynomial has measure zero, but f is the product of 2n linear terms, which is a non-zero polynomial. Wait, but actually, f(x) is the product of n terms from Px and n terms from x, so total degree 2n. However, the set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the 2n hyperplanes. But since these hyperplanes are all of codimension 1, their union is a closed set with empty interior. Therefore, the complement, where f(x) ≠ 0, is open and dense. Therefore, there exist vectors x where f(x) ≠ 0, which means all entries of x and all entries of Px are non-zero. Hence, such vectors exist.

This again confirms that the answer is yes.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for each row p_i of P, the hyperplane p_i ⋅ x = 0 does not contain any of the coordinate hyperplanes x_j = 0, unless p_i is aligned with some coordinate axis. But since P is orthogonal, if any row p_i were aligned with a coordinate axis, then the corresponding column would also be that axis vector, making P a permutation matrix (possibly with sign changes). But even if P is a permutation matrix with sign changes (i.e., generalized permutation matrix), then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 correspond to x_j = 0 for some j, depending on the permutation and sign. However, in such a case, avoiding those hyperplanes would correspond to avoiding certain coordinate hyperplanes. But if P is a generalized permutation matrix, then Px is just a permutation of x with possible sign changes. Therefore, if we choose x with all entries non-zero, then Px will also have all entries non-zero, since permutation and sign changes don&#x27;t introduce zeros. Therefore, in that case, any x with no zero entries works. 

If P is not a generalized permutation matrix, then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 are not coordinate hyperplanes, so the union of these hyperplanes and the coordinate hyperplanes is a union of 2n distinct hyperplanes (assuming no overlap). However, even if there is overlap, the key point is that the union is a closed set with empty interior, so the complement is open and dense. Therefore, regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, the existence of such an x is guaranteed.

To summarize:

1. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is open and dense.
2. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open and dense.
3. The intersection of these two sets is non-empty due to the Baire Category Theorem.
4. Therefore, there must exist at least one vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Therefore, the answer is yes, such a vector x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given an orthogonal matrix \( P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \), we need to determine whether there exists a vector \( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \) with no zero entries such that \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

1. **Orthogonal Matrix Properties**: An orthogonal matrix \( P \) has orthonormal rows and columns, meaning \( P^T P = I \). This implies that the rows of \( P \) form an orthonormal basis for \( \mathbb{R}^n \).

2. **Hyperplanes Consideration**: We need a vector \( x \) such that both \( x \) and \( Px \) have no zero entries. This translates to finding \( x \) such that \( x \) is not orthogonal to any row of \( P \), i.e., \( p_i \cdot x \neq 0 \) for all rows \( p_i \) of \( P \).

3. **Dense Sets Argument**: 
   - The set of vectors with no zero entries (complement of coordinate hyperplanes) is open and dense in \( \mathbb{R}^n \).
   - The set of vectors \( x \) such that \( Px \) has no zero entries (complement of hyperplanes orthogonal to rows of \( P \)) is also open and dense.

4. **Intersection of Dense Sets**: By the Baire Category Theorem, the intersection of two open dense sets in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) is non-empty. Therefore, there exists a vector \( x \) that lies in both sets, meaning \( x \) has no zero entries and \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

5. **Conclusion**: The existence of such a vector \( x \) is guaranteed by the density and openness arguments, confirming that the required vector exists for any orthogonal matrix \( P \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem: Given an orthogonal matrix P in R^{n x n}, does there exist a vector x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries? Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall what an orthogonal matrix is. An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix whose columns and rows are orthonormal vectors. That means P^T P = I, where P^T is the transpose of P and I is the identity matrix. So, the inverse of P is just its transpose. Orthogonal matrices preserve the dot product, so they preserve angles and lengths. That means transformations like rotations and reflections are orthogonal.

Now, the question is about whether there&#x27;s a vector x with all non-zero entries such that when we multiply it by P, the resulting vector also has all non-zero entries. So, both x and Px must have no zeros in any of their components. 

Let me rephrase the problem: We need to find a vector x in R^n with all entries non-zero such that none of the entries of Px are zero. Alternatively, for each row of P, the dot product with x is non-zero. So, for each row vector p_i of P, p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0. So, the problem reduces to finding an x with all entries non-zero that is not orthogonal to any of the rows of P.

Since P is orthogonal, its rows form an orthonormal basis for R^n. So, the rows are unit vectors and mutually orthogonal. But we need a vector x that is not orthogonal to any of these rows. So, x cannot be orthogonal to any row of P.

But is such an x guaranteed to exist? Hmm. Let me think. In R^n, given a finite set of vectors (in this case, n orthonormal vectors), does there exist a vector that is not orthogonal to any of them?

Alternatively, the question is: Can we find a vector x such that for each i from 1 to n, the inner product of x with the i-th row of P is not zero. Since the rows are orthonormal, they form a basis. So, x can be expressed in terms of this basis. But x is in R^n, so any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the rows. Wait, but the rows themselves are orthonormal, so if we express x as a combination of the rows, then the coefficients would just be the inner products of x with each row. But if we require that all those coefficients are non-zero, then x must have a non-zero component in each row direction. So, in other words, if we write x = c_1 p_1 + c_2 p_2 + ... + c_n p_n, where p_i are the rows of P, then all c_i must be non-zero. But since the rows of P form a basis, any x can be written this way, and we can choose the coefficients c_i to be non-zero. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, but hold on. If we set x to be the sum of all the rows with coefficients 1, then x = p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n, and then Px would be... Wait, no, P is the matrix whose rows are p_i, so multiplying P by x would give us a vector where each component is p_i ⋅ x. But if x is the sum of all p_j, then p_i ⋅ x = p_i ⋅ (p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n) = p_i ⋅ p_i + sum_{j ≠ i} p_i ⋅ p_j. Since the rows are orthonormal, p_i ⋅ p_j = δ_{ij}, so this simplifies to 1 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1. So, Px would be a vector of all ones. Therefore, in that case, x = p_1 + ... + p_n would have Px = (1,1,...,1)^T, which has no zero entries. But wait, does x itself have non-zero entries? Not necessarily. If the sum of the rows of P results in a vector with all non-zero entries, then we&#x27;re done. But maybe in some cases, the sum of the rows could have a zero entry. For example, if P is a permutation matrix, say swapping two coordinates, then the sum of the rows would be (1,1), which in higher dimensions might still have all entries non-zero? Wait, no, a permutation matrix in higher dimensions just permutes the entries. So, if you sum all the rows of a permutation matrix, you would get a vector of all ones, right? Because each row has a single 1 and the rest zeros, and summing all rows would give a vector with n ones. So, in that case, x would be the vector of all ones, which has no zero entries, and Px would also be the vector of all ones, since permutation matrices just permute the entries. Wait, no. If x is all ones, then Px would permute the entries of x, which are all ones, so Px would still be all ones. So, in that case, both x and Px have all entries non-zero.

But wait, this seems too specific. What if P is a different orthogonal matrix? For example, suppose P is a rotation matrix in 2D. Let&#x27;s take n=2. Then, a rotation matrix is orthogonal. Suppose we have a rotation by some angle θ. Then, is there a vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries?

Well, let&#x27;s take x = (1,1). Then, Px would be (cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ). Are there θ such that either component is zero? For example, if θ = 45 degrees, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. Then, Px would be (0, √2). So, the first component is zero. Oh, so in this case, x = (1,1) would result in Px having a zero entry. But does there exist another x with no zero entries such that Px also has none?

Suppose we take x = (a, b) with a, b ≠ 0. Then, Px = (a cosθ - b sinθ, a sinθ + b cosθ). For this to have no zeros, we need a cosθ - b sinθ ≠ 0 and a sinθ + b cosθ ≠ 0.

So, can we choose a and b such that these are satisfied? Let&#x27;s see. If θ is 45 degrees, as above, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. So, the first component becomes (a - b)√2/2 and the second component becomes (a + b)√2/2. So, to have both components non-zero, we need a ≠ b and a ≠ -b. So, as long as a ≠ b and a ≠ -b, then x = (a, b) would work. For example, take a = 1, b = 2. Then, both components are non-zero. So, even though x = (1,1) leads to a zero in the first component, another x with non-zero entries can work.

Therefore, in 2D, even if the rotation matrix can map some non-zero vectors to ones with zeros, there still exist vectors with no zero entries that are mapped to vectors with no zero entries. So, maybe in general, such vectors exist?

Alternatively, maybe we can use a density argument. The set of vectors with no zero entries is dense in R^n. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also dense, since it&#x27;s the complement of the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P. Since the union of hyperplanes has measure zero, their complement is dense. Therefore, the intersection of these two sets (vectors with no zero entries such that Px also has none) is also dense, hence non-empty.

Wait, that might be a more abstract way to see it. Let me elaborate. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the coordinate hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. Each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is a closed set with empty interior. Similarly, the set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}, where p_i are the rows of P. Again, each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is closed with empty interior. Therefore, both complements are open and dense in R^n. The intersection of two open dense sets is also open and dense, hence non-empty. Therefore, there must exist vectors x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, since the rows of P form an orthonormal basis, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are n distinct hyperplanes. The set of vectors not lying in any of these hyperplanes is the complement of their union, which is dense. Similarly, the set of vectors with no zero entries is the complement of the union of coordinate hyperplanes, also dense. The intersection of these two dense sets is non-empty by the Baire Category Theorem, which states that in a complete metric space (like R^n), the intersection of countably many dense open sets is dense. Since we&#x27;re dealing with finite unions of hyperplanes, the complements are open and dense, so their intersection is dense, hence non-empty.

Therefore, such a vector x must exist. Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector exists.

Wait, but let me test this with a specific example. Suppose P is the identity matrix. Then, the rows are the standard basis vectors. So, the hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. The set of vectors with no zero entries is exactly the complement of the union of these hyperplanes. So, in this case, the vectors x with no zero entries are exactly those for which Px (which is x itself) has no zero entries. So, in this case, the two conditions are the same, so the intersection is the same set, which is non-empty. So, works here.

Another example: Let P be a permutation matrix. Then, as before, x with all non-zero entries will be permuted, so Px will have the same entries as x but in different order. Therefore, Px will also have no zero entries. Therefore, in this case, any x with no zero entries works. So, definitely exists.

Another example: Take P to be a rotation matrix in 3D. Suppose we rotate around some axis. Then, similar to the 2D case, can we find a vector x with all non-zero entries such that Px also has all non-zero entries? Let&#x27;s see. Let’s take x = (1,1,1). If we rotate x by some angle, the result might not have any zero entries, depending on the rotation. But even if it does, we can perturb x slightly to avoid zeros. For example, if rotating x = (1,1,1) by 90 degrees around the z-axis gives ( -1, 1, 1), which still has no zeros. Wait, but a 90 degree rotation around z-axis would send (x, y, z) to (-y, x, z). So, x = (1,1,1) becomes (-1, 1, 1), which indeed has no zeros. So in this case, it works. But maybe another rotation could cause a zero? Suppose we have a rotation that aligns a vector with an axis. Wait, but if we rotate a vector with all non-zero entries, would it ever result in a zero? For example, rotating (1,1,1) around some axis by some angle. If the rotation is such that one component becomes zero, then that would require that vector to be orthogonal to one of the coordinate axes, but (1,1,1) is not orthogonal to any coordinate axis unless we have specific rotations. Wait, but actually, any rotation is an orthogonal transformation, but to get a zero component, you would need the rotated vector to lie on a coordinate hyperplane. However, if the original vector is not on any rotated hyperplane corresponding to the coordinate axes, then the rotated vector won&#x27;t have zeros. But perhaps this is too vague.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider specific angles. Suppose we rotate (1,1,1) by 45 degrees around some axis. Depending on the axis, this might or might not introduce zeros. But maybe choosing an axis that isn&#x27;t aligned with the coordinate axes. For example, rotating around the vector (1,1,1) itself by some angle. Then, the vector (1,1,1) would remain unchanged, so no zeros. If we rotate around another axis, say (1,0,0), by 45 degrees. Then, the rotation in the y-z plane. The x-component remains 1, and y and z components become (y cosθ - z sinθ, y sinθ + z cosθ). So, with θ = 45 degrees, y and z components become ( (y - z)/√2, (y + z)/√2 ). If original x is (1,1,1), then after rotation, it becomes (1, (1 - 1)/√2 = 0, (1 + 1)/√2 = √2 ). So, the y-component becomes zero. Oh, so in this case, rotating (1,1,1) around the x-axis by 45 degrees results in a vector with a zero entry. But then, does that mean that for this particular rotation matrix, the vector x = (1,1,1) leads to Px having a zero? But the question is whether there exists some x with no zero entries such that Px also has none. In this case, even though (1,1,1) doesn&#x27;t work, maybe another vector does. For example, take x = (1, 2, 1). Then, rotating around x-axis by 45 degrees gives (1, (2 - 1)/√2, (2 + 1)/√2 ) = (1, 1/√2, 3/√2 ), which has no zeros. So, yes, such a vector exists. So even if some vectors lead to zeros after transformation, others don&#x27;t.

This seems to support the idea that regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, we can always find such a vector x. The key idea is that the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P and the coordinate hyperplanes have measure zero, so their complements intersect.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the set S of vectors x with no zero entries. This is an open set in R^n (since it&#x27;s the complement of the closed set where at least one coordinate is zero). Similarly, the set T of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open, as it&#x27;s the complement of the union of hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}. Since P is orthogonal, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are distinct from the coordinate hyperplanes if P is not a permutation matrix. But even if they overlap, the important thing is that both S and T are open and dense. The intersection of two open dense sets is non-empty in R^n, as R^n is a Baire space. Therefore, S ∩ T ≠ ∅, meaning there exists a vector x in both S and T, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of linear algebra, suppose we want to find x such that x_i ≠ 0 for all i, and (Px)_j ≠ 0 for all j. Let me try to construct such an x. Since P is invertible (orthogonal matrices are invertible), the mapping x ↦ Px is a bijection. Therefore, the image of the set S (vectors with no zero entries) under P is the same as the set T. Since S is open and dense, and P is a homeomorphism (continuous bijection with continuous inverse), then T = P(S) is also open and dense. Therefore, T ∩ S is the intersection of two open dense sets, which must be non-empty. Therefore, there exists x in S such that Px is also in S, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, this seems like a solid argument. Since S is open and dense, and T = P(S) is also open and dense, their intersection is non-empty. Therefore, yes, such an x exists.

But let me check if this reasoning holds. If S is the set of vectors with no zero entries, and T is the set of vectors y such that y = Px has no zero entries, which is equivalent to x = P^T y having no zero entries? Wait, no. T is the set of x such that Px has no zero entries. So, T = {x | Px ∈ S}. Since P is invertible, T = P^{-1}(S). Since S is open and dense, and P^{-1} is a homeomorphism, T is also open and dense. Therefore, S and T are both open and dense, so their intersection is non-empty.

Therefore, there exists x ∈ S ∩ T, which means x has no zero entries, and Px also has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector x exists.

But let me see if I can construct such a vector explicitly. Suppose we take a vector x with all entries equal to 1. Then, Px is the sum of the columns of P. Wait, no, if x is all ones, then Px is the sum of the columns of P scaled by 1. But the columns of P are orthonormal. The sum of the columns of P would be a vector whose norm squared is n, since each column is a unit vector and they are orthogonal. So, the sum would have norm sqrt(n). But does the sum have any zero entries? Not necessarily. For example, if P is the identity matrix, then the sum is (1,1,...,1), which has no zeros. If P is a permutation matrix, the sum is also (1,1,...,1). If P is a rotation matrix, the sum could be different. For instance, in 2D, if P is a rotation by θ, then the sum of the columns would be [cosθ + (-sinθ), sinθ + cosθ], which is [cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ]. For θ = 45 degrees, this becomes [0, √2], which has a zero. So, in that case, x being all ones would result in Px having a zero. But as we saw before, if we take x = (1, 2), then Px might not have any zeros. So, the all-ones vector might not work, but another vector might.

Alternatively, maybe a vector with all entries positive. Since if all entries are positive, then Px is a linear combination of the columns of P with positive coefficients. But the columns of P are orthonormal, so they form a basis. If all coefficients are positive, can such a combination result in a zero entry? Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a vector x with all positive entries such that Px has a zero entry. Then, the zero entry corresponds to a row of P (since Px is computed by row-wise dot products). So, there exists a row p_i of P such that p_i ⋅ x = 0. But x has all positive entries, and p_i is a unit vector. However, the dot product being zero would mean that p_i is orthogonal to x. But since x is in the positive orthant, and p_i is a unit vector, is it possible for p_i to be orthogonal to x?

Yes, it&#x27;s possible. For example, take p_i = (1, -1, 0, ..., 0)/sqrt(2). Then, the dot product with x = (1,1,1,...,1) would be (1 - 1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + ... + 0 = 0. So, even with x having all positive entries, p_i ⋅ x can be zero. Therefore, just having positive entries is not sufficient. But the question is whether there exists some x with all non-zero entries (not necessarily all positive) such that p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0 for all i.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the function f(x) = (Px)_1 * (Px)_2 * ... * (Px)_n * x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_n. We need to find x such that f(x) ≠ 0. Since f is the product of all entries of Px and all entries of x, it&#x27;s a polynomial in the entries of x. The set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the hyperplanes {x_i = 0} and {p_i ⋅ x = 0} for each i. Since we are in R^n, and the zero set of a non-zero polynomial has measure zero, but f is the product of 2n linear terms, which is a non-zero polynomial. Wait, but actually, f(x) is the product of n terms from Px and n terms from x, so total degree 2n. However, the set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the 2n hyperplanes. But since these hyperplanes are all of codimension 1, their union is a closed set with empty interior. Therefore, the complement, where f(x) ≠ 0, is open and dense. Therefore, there exist vectors x where f(x) ≠ 0, which means all entries of x and all entries of Px are non-zero. Hence, such vectors exist.

This again confirms that the answer is yes.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for each row p_i of P, the hyperplane p_i ⋅ x = 0 does not contain any of the coordinate hyperplanes x_j = 0, unless p_i is aligned with some coordinate axis. But since P is orthogonal, if any row p_i were aligned with a coordinate axis, then the corresponding column would also be that axis vector, making P a permutation matrix (possibly with sign changes). But even if P is a permutation matrix with sign changes (i.e., generalized permutation matrix), then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 correspond to x_j = 0 for some j, depending on the permutation and sign. However, in such a case, avoiding those hyperplanes would correspond to avoiding certain coordinate hyperplanes. But if P is a generalized permutation matrix, then Px is just a permutation of x with possible sign changes. Therefore, if we choose x with all entries non-zero, then Px will also have all entries non-zero, since permutation and sign changes don&#x27;t introduce zeros. Therefore, in that case, any x with no zero entries works. 

If P is not a generalized permutation matrix, then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 are not coordinate hyperplanes, so the union of these hyperplanes and the coordinate hyperplanes is a union of 2n distinct hyperplanes (assuming no overlap). However, even if there is overlap, the key point is that the union is a closed set with empty interior, so the complement is open and dense. Therefore, regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, the existence of such an x is guaranteed.

To summarize:

1. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is open and dense.
2. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open and dense.
3. The intersection of these two sets is non-empty due to the Baire Category Theorem.
4. Therefore, there must exist at least one vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Therefore, the answer is yes, such a vector x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

Given an orthogonal matrix \( P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \), we need to determine whether there exists a vector \( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \) with no zero entries such that \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

1. **Orthogonal Matrix Properties**: An orthogonal matrix \( P \) has orthonormal rows and columns, meaning \( P^T P = I \). This implies that the rows of \( P \) form an orthonormal basis for \( \mathbb{R}^n \).

2. **Hyperplanes Consideration**: We need a vector \( x \) such that both \( x \) and \( Px \) have no zero entries. This translates to finding \( x \) such that \( x \) is not orthogonal to any row of \( P \), i.e., \( p_i \cdot x \neq 0 \) for all rows \( p_i \) of \( P \).

3. **Dense Sets Argument**:

   - The set of vectors \( x \) such that \( Px \) has no zero entries (complement of hyperplanes orthogonal to rows of \( P \)) is also open and dense.

4. **Intersection of Dense Sets**: By the Baire Category Theorem, the intersection of two open dense sets in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) is non-empty. Therefore, there exists a vector \( x \) that lies in both sets, meaning \( x \) has no zero entries and \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

5. **Conclusion**: The existence of such a vector \( x \) is guaranteed by the density and openness arguments, confirming that the required vector exists for any orthogonal matrix \( P \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem: Given an orthogonal matrix P in R^{n x n}, does there exist a vector x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries? Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall what an orthogonal matrix is. An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix whose columns and rows are orthonormal vectors. That means P^T P = I, where P^T is the transpose of P and I is the identity matrix. So, the inverse of P is just its transpose. Orthogonal matrices preserve the dot product, so they preserve angles and lengths. That means transformations like rotations and reflections are orthogonal.

Now, the question is about whether there&#x27;s a vector x with all non-zero entries such that when we multiply it by P, the resulting vector also has all non-zero entries. So, both x and Px must have no zeros in any of their components. 

Let me rephrase the problem: We need to find a vector x in R^n with all entries non-zero such that none of the entries of Px are zero. Alternatively, for each row of P, the dot product with x is non-zero. So, for each row vector p_i of P, p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0. So, the problem reduces to finding an x with all entries non-zero that is not orthogonal to any of the rows of P.

Since P is orthogonal, its rows form an orthonormal basis for R^n. So, the rows are unit vectors and mutually orthogonal. But we need a vector x that is not orthogonal to any of these rows. So, x cannot be orthogonal to any row of P.

But is such an x guaranteed to exist? Hmm. Let me think. In R^n, given a finite set of vectors (in this case, n orthonormal vectors), does there exist a vector that is not orthogonal to any of them?

Alternatively, the question is: Can we find a vector x such that for each i from 1 to n, the inner product of x with the i-th row of P is not zero. Since the rows are orthonormal, they form a basis. So, x can be expressed in terms of this basis. But x is in R^n, so any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the rows. Wait, but the rows themselves are orthonormal, so if we express x as a combination of the rows, then the coefficients would just be the inner products of x with each row. But if we require that all those coefficients are non-zero, then x must have a non-zero component in each row direction. So, in other words, if we write x = c_1 p_1 + c_2 p_2 + ... + c_n p_n, where p_i are the rows of P, then all c_i must be non-zero. But since the rows of P form a basis, any x can be written this way, and we can choose the coefficients c_i to be non-zero. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, but hold on. If we set x to be the sum of all the rows with coefficients 1, then x = p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n, and then Px would be... Wait, no, P is the matrix whose rows are p_i, so multiplying P by x would give us a vector where each component is p_i ⋅ x. But if x is the sum of all p_j, then p_i ⋅ x = p_i ⋅ (p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n) = p_i ⋅ p_i + sum_{j ≠ i} p_i ⋅ p_j. Since the rows are orthonormal, p_i ⋅ p_j = δ_{ij}, so this simplifies to 1 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1. So, Px would be a vector of all ones. Therefore, in that case, x = p_1 + ... + p_n would have Px = (1,1,...,1)^T, which has no zero entries. But wait, does x itself have non-zero entries? Not necessarily. If the sum of the rows of P results in a vector with all non-zero entries, then we&#x27;re done. But maybe in some cases, the sum of the rows could have a zero entry. For example, if P is a permutation matrix, say swapping two coordinates, then the sum of the rows would be (1,1), which in higher dimensions might still have all entries non-zero? Wait, no, a permutation matrix in higher dimensions just permutes the entries. So, if you sum all the rows of a permutation matrix, you would get a vector of all ones, right? Because each row has a single 1 and the rest zeros, and summing all rows would give a vector with n ones. So, in that case, x would be the vector of all ones, which has no zero entries, and Px would also be the vector of all ones, since permutation matrices just permute the entries. Wait, no. If x is all ones, then Px would permute the entries of x, which are all ones, so Px would still be all ones. So, in that case, both x and Px have all entries non-zero.

But wait, this seems too specific. What if P is a different orthogonal matrix? For example, suppose P is a rotation matrix in 2D. Let&#x27;s take n=2. Then, a rotation matrix is orthogonal. Suppose we have a rotation by some angle θ. Then, is there a vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries?

Well, let&#x27;s take x = (1,1). Then, Px would be (cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ). Are there θ such that either component is zero? For example, if θ = 45 degrees, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. Then, Px would be (0, √2). So, the first component is zero. Oh, so in this case, x = (1,1) would result in Px having a zero entry. But does there exist another x with no zero entries such that Px also has none?

Suppose we take x = (a, b) with a, b ≠ 0. Then, Px = (a cosθ - b sinθ, a sinθ + b cosθ). For this to have no zeros, we need a cosθ - b sinθ ≠ 0 and a sinθ + b cosθ ≠ 0.

So, can we choose a and b such that these are satisfied? Let&#x27;s see. If θ is 45 degrees, as above, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. So, the first component becomes (a - b)√2/2 and the second component becomes (a + b)√2/2. So, to have both components non-zero, we need a ≠ b and a ≠ -b. So, as long as a ≠ b and a ≠ -b, then x = (a, b) would work. For example, take a = 1, b = 2. Then, both components are non-zero. So, even though x = (1,1) leads to a zero in the first component, another x with non-zero entries can work.

Therefore, in 2D, even if the rotation matrix can map some non-zero vectors to ones with zeros, there still exist vectors with no zero entries that are mapped to vectors with no zero entries. So, maybe in general, such vectors exist?

Alternatively, maybe we can use a density argument. The set of vectors with no zero entries is dense in R^n. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also dense, since it&#x27;s the complement of the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P. Since the union of hyperplanes has measure zero, their complement is dense. Therefore, the intersection of these two sets (vectors with no zero entries such that Px also has none) is also dense, hence non-empty.

Wait, that might be a more abstract way to see it. Let me elaborate. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the coordinate hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. Each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is a closed set with empty interior. Similarly, the set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}, where p_i are the rows of P. Again, each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is closed with empty interior. Therefore, both complements are open and dense in R^n. The intersection of two open dense sets is also open and dense, hence non-empty. Therefore, there must exist vectors x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, since the rows of P form an orthonormal basis, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are n distinct hyperplanes. The set of vectors not lying in any of these hyperplanes is the complement of their union, which is dense. Similarly, the set of vectors with no zero entries is the complement of the union of coordinate hyperplanes, also dense. The intersection of these two dense sets is non-empty by the Baire Category Theorem, which states that in a complete metric space (like R^n), the intersection of countably many dense open sets is dense. Since we&#x27;re dealing with finite unions of hyperplanes, the complements are open and dense, so their intersection is dense, hence non-empty.

Therefore, such a vector x must exist. Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector exists.

Wait, but let me test this with a specific example. Suppose P is the identity matrix. Then, the rows are the standard basis vectors. So, the hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. The set of vectors with no zero entries is exactly the complement of the union of these hyperplanes. So, in this case, the vectors x with no zero entries are exactly those for which Px (which is x itself) has no zero entries. So, in this case, the two conditions are the same, so the intersection is the same set, which is non-empty. So, works here.

Another example: Let P be a permutation matrix. Then, as before, x with all non-zero entries will be permuted, so Px will have the same entries as x but in different order. Therefore, Px will also have no zero entries. Therefore, in this case, any x with no zero entries works. So, definitely exists.

Another example: Take P to be a rotation matrix in 3D. Suppose we rotate around some axis. Then, similar to the 2D case, can we find a vector x with all non-zero entries such that Px also has all non-zero entries? Let&#x27;s see. Let’s take x = (1,1,1). If we rotate x by some angle, the result might not have any zero entries, depending on the rotation. But even if it does, we can perturb x slightly to avoid zeros. For example, if rotating x = (1,1,1) by 90 degrees around the z-axis gives ( -1, 1, 1), which still has no zeros. Wait, but a 90 degree rotation around z-axis would send (x, y, z) to (-y, x, z). So, x = (1,1,1) becomes (-1, 1, 1), which indeed has no zeros. So in this case, it works. But maybe another rotation could cause a zero? Suppose we have a rotation that aligns a vector with an axis. Wait, but if we rotate a vector with all non-zero entries, would it ever result in a zero? For example, rotating (1,1,1) around some axis by some angle. If the rotation is such that one component becomes zero, then that would require that vector to be orthogonal to one of the coordinate axes, but (1,1,1) is not orthogonal to any coordinate axis unless we have specific rotations. Wait, but actually, any rotation is an orthogonal transformation, but to get a zero component, you would need the rotated vector to lie on a coordinate hyperplane. However, if the original vector is not on any rotated hyperplane corresponding to the coordinate axes, then the rotated vector won&#x27;t have zeros. But perhaps this is too vague.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider specific angles. Suppose we rotate (1,1,1) by 45 degrees around some axis. Depending on the axis, this might or might not introduce zeros. But maybe choosing an axis that isn&#x27;t aligned with the coordinate axes. For example, rotating around the vector (1,1,1) itself by some angle. Then, the vector (1,1,1) would remain unchanged, so no zeros. If we rotate around another axis, say (1,0,0), by 45 degrees. Then, the rotation in the y-z plane. The x-component remains 1, and y and z components become (y cosθ - z sinθ, y sinθ + z cosθ). So, with θ = 45 degrees, y and z components become ( (y - z)/√2, (y + z)/√2 ). If original x is (1,1,1), then after rotation, it becomes (1, (1 - 1)/√2 = 0, (1 + 1)/√2 = √2 ). So, the y-component becomes zero. Oh, so in this case, rotating (1,1,1) around the x-axis by 45 degrees results in a vector with a zero entry. But then, does that mean that for this particular rotation matrix, the vector x = (1,1,1) leads to Px having a zero? But the question is whether there exists some x with no zero entries such that Px also has none. In this case, even though (1,1,1) doesn&#x27;t work, maybe another vector does. For example, take x = (1, 2, 1). Then, rotating around x-axis by 45 degrees gives (1, (2 - 1)/√2, (2 + 1)/√2 ) = (1, 1/√2, 3/√2 ), which has no zeros. So, yes, such a vector exists. So even if some vectors lead to zeros after transformation, others don&#x27;t.

This seems to support the idea that regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, we can always find such a vector x. The key idea is that the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P and the coordinate hyperplanes have measure zero, so their complements intersect.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the set S of vectors x with no zero entries. This is an open set in R^n (since it&#x27;s the complement of the closed set where at least one coordinate is zero). Similarly, the set T of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open, as it&#x27;s the complement of the union of hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}. Since P is orthogonal, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are distinct from the coordinate hyperplanes if P is not a permutation matrix. But even if they overlap, the important thing is that both S and T are open and dense. The intersection of two open dense sets is non-empty in R^n, as R^n is a Baire space. Therefore, S ∩ T ≠ ∅, meaning there exists a vector x in both S and T, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of linear algebra, suppose we want to find x such that x_i ≠ 0 for all i, and (Px)_j ≠ 0 for all j. Let me try to construct such an x. Since P is invertible (orthogonal matrices are invertible), the mapping x ↦ Px is a bijection. Therefore, the image of the set S (vectors with no zero entries) under P is the same as the set T. Since S is open and dense, and P is a homeomorphism (continuous bijection with continuous inverse), then T = P(S) is also open and dense. Therefore, T ∩ S is the intersection of two open dense sets, which must be non-empty. Therefore, there exists x in S such that Px is also in S, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, this seems like a solid argument. Since S is open and dense, and T = P(S) is also open and dense, their intersection is non-empty. Therefore, yes, such an x exists.

But let me check if this reasoning holds. If S is the set of vectors with no zero entries, and T is the set of vectors y such that y = Px has no zero entries, which is equivalent to x = P^T y having no zero entries? Wait, no. T is the set of x such that Px has no zero entries. So, T = {x | Px ∈ S}. Since P is invertible, T = P^{-1}(S). Since S is open and dense, and P^{-1} is a homeomorphism, T is also open and dense. Therefore, S and T are both open and dense, so their intersection is non-empty.

Therefore, there exists x ∈ S ∩ T, which means x has no zero entries, and Px also has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector x exists.

But let me see if I can construct such a vector explicitly. Suppose we take a vector x with all entries equal to 1. Then, Px is the sum of the columns of P. Wait, no, if x is all ones, then Px is the sum of the columns of P scaled by 1. But the columns of P are orthonormal. The sum of the columns of P would be a vector whose norm squared is n, since each column is a unit vector and they are orthogonal. So, the sum would have norm sqrt(n). But does the sum have any zero entries? Not necessarily. For example, if P is the identity matrix, then the sum is (1,1,...,1), which has no zeros. If P is a permutation matrix, the sum is also (1,1,...,1). If P is a rotation matrix, the sum could be different. For instance, in 2D, if P is a rotation by θ, then the sum of the columns would be [cosθ + (-sinθ), sinθ + cosθ], which is [cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ]. For θ = 45 degrees, this becomes [0, √2], which has a zero. So, in that case, x being all ones would result in Px having a zero. But as we saw before, if we take x = (1, 2), then Px might not have any zeros. So, the all-ones vector might not work, but another vector might.

Alternatively, maybe a vector with all entries positive. Since if all entries are positive, then Px is a linear combination of the columns of P with positive coefficients. But the columns of P are orthonormal, so they form a basis. If all coefficients are positive, can such a combination result in a zero entry? Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a vector x with all positive entries such that Px has a zero entry. Then, the zero entry corresponds to a row of P (since Px is computed by row-wise dot products). So, there exists a row p_i of P such that p_i ⋅ x = 0. But x has all positive entries, and p_i is a unit vector. However, the dot product being zero would mean that p_i is orthogonal to x. But since x is in the positive orthant, and p_i is a unit vector, is it possible for p_i to be orthogonal to x?

Yes, it&#x27;s possible. For example, take p_i = (1, -1, 0, ..., 0)/sqrt(2). Then, the dot product with x = (1,1,1,...,1) would be (1 - 1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + ... + 0 = 0. So, even with x having all positive entries, p_i ⋅ x can be zero. Therefore, just having positive entries is not sufficient. But the question is whether there exists some x with all non-zero entries (not necessarily all positive) such that p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0 for all i.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the function f(x) = (Px)_1 * (Px)_2 * ... * (Px)_n * x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_n. We need to find x such that f(x) ≠ 0. Since f is the product of all entries of Px and all entries of x, it&#x27;s a polynomial in the entries of x. The set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the hyperplanes {x_i = 0} and {p_i ⋅ x = 0} for each i. Since we are in R^n, and the zero set of a non-zero polynomial has measure zero, but f is the product of 2n linear terms, which is a non-zero polynomial. Wait, but actually, f(x) is the product of n terms from Px and n terms from x, so total degree 2n. However, the set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the 2n hyperplanes. But since these hyperplanes are all of codimension 1, their union is a closed set with empty interior. Therefore, the complement, where f(x) ≠ 0, is open and dense. Therefore, there exist vectors x where f(x) ≠ 0, which means all entries of x and all entries of Px are non-zero. Hence, such vectors exist.

This again confirms that the answer is yes.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for each row p_i of P, the hyperplane p_i ⋅ x = 0 does not contain any of the coordinate hyperplanes x_j = 0, unless p_i is aligned with some coordinate axis. But since P is orthogonal, if any row p_i were aligned with a coordinate axis, then the corresponding column would also be that axis vector, making P a permutation matrix (possibly with sign changes). But even if P is a permutation matrix with sign changes (i.e., generalized permutation matrix), then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 correspond to x_j = 0 for some j, depending on the permutation and sign. However, in such a case, avoiding those hyperplanes would correspond to avoiding certain coordinate hyperplanes. But if P is a generalized permutation matrix, then Px is just a permutation of x with possible sign changes. Therefore, if we choose x with all entries non-zero, then Px will also have all entries non-zero, since permutation and sign changes don&#x27;t introduce zeros. Therefore, in that case, any x with no zero entries works. 

If P is not a generalized permutation matrix, then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 are not coordinate hyperplanes, so the union of these hyperplanes and the coordinate hyperplanes is a union of 2n distinct hyperplanes (assuming no overlap). However, even if there is overlap, the key point is that the union is a closed set with empty interior, so the complement is open and dense. Therefore, regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, the existence of such an x is guaranteed.

To summarize:

1. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is open and dense.
2. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open and dense.
3. The intersection of these two sets is non-empty due to the Baire Category Theorem.
4. Therefore, there must exist at least one vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Therefore, the answer is yes, such a vector x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

Since P is orthogonal, its rows form an orthonormal basis for R^n. So, the rows are unit vectors and mutually orthogonal. But we need a vector x that is not orthogonal to any of these rows. So, x cannot be orthogonal to any row of P.

But is such an x guaranteed to exist? Hmm. Let me think. In R^n, given a finite set of vectors (in this case, n orthonormal vectors), does there exist a vector that is not orthogonal to any of them?

Alternatively, the question is: Can we find a vector x such that for each i from 1 to n, the inner product of x with the i-th row of P is not zero. Since the rows are orthonormal, they form a basis. So, x can be expressed in terms of this basis. But x is in R^n, so any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the rows. Wait, but the rows themselves are orthonormal, so if we express x as a combination of the rows, then the coefficients would just be the inner products of x with each row. But if we require that all those coefficients are non-zero, then x must have a non-zero component in each row direction. So, in other words, if we write x = c_1 p_1 + c_2 p_2 + ... + c_n p_n, where p_i are the rows of P, then all c_i must be non-zero. But since the rows of P form a basis, any x can be written this way, and we can choose the coefficients c_i to be non-zero. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, but hold on. If we set x to be the sum of all the rows with coefficients 1, then x = p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n, and then Px would be... Wait, no, P is the matrix whose rows are p_i, so multiplying P by x would give us a vector where each component is p_i ⋅ x. But if x is the sum of all p_j, then p_i ⋅ x = p_i ⋅ (p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n) = p_i ⋅ p_i + sum_{j ≠ i} p_i ⋅ p_j. Since the rows are orthonormal, p_i ⋅ p_j = δ_{ij}, so this simplifies to 1 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1. So, Px would be a vector of all ones. Therefore, in that case, x = p_1 + ... + p_n would have Px = (1,1,...,1)^T, which has no zero entries. But wait, does x itself have non-zero entries? Not necessarily. If the sum of the rows of P results in a vector with all non-zero entries, then we&#x27;re done. But maybe in some cases, the sum of the rows could have a zero entry. For example, if P is a permutation matrix, say swapping two coordinates, then the sum of the rows would be (1,1), which in higher dimensions might still have all entries non-zero? Wait, no, a permutation matrix in higher dimensions just permutes the entries. So, if you sum all the rows of a permutation matrix, you would get a vector of all ones, right? Because each row has a single 1 and the rest zeros, and summing all rows would give a vector with n ones. So, in that case, x would be the vector of all ones, which has no zero entries, and Px would also be the vector of all ones, since permutation matrices just permute the entries. Wait, no. If x is all ones, then Px would permute the entries of x, which are all ones, so Px would still be all ones. So, in that case, both x and Px have all entries non-zero.

But wait, this seems too specific. What if P is a different orthogonal matrix? For example, suppose P is a rotation matrix in 2D. Let&#x27;s take n=2. Then, a rotation matrix is orthogonal. Suppose we have a rotation by some angle θ. Then, is there a vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries?

Well, let&#x27;s take x = (1,1). Then, Px would be (cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ). Are there θ such that either component is zero? For example, if θ = 45 degrees, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. Then, Px would be (0, √2). So, the first component is zero. Oh, so in this case, x = (1,1) would result in Px having a zero entry. But does there exist another x with no zero entries such that Px also has none?

Suppose we take x = (a, b) with a, b ≠ 0. Then, Px = (a cosθ - b sinθ, a sinθ + b cosθ). For this to have no zeros, we need a cosθ - b sinθ ≠ 0 and a sinθ + b cosθ ≠ 0.

So, can we choose a and b such that these are satisfied? Let&#x27;s see. If θ is 45 degrees, as above, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. So, the first component becomes (a - b)√2/2 and the second component becomes (a + b)√2/2. So, to have both components non-zero, we need a ≠ b and a ≠ -b. So, as long as a ≠ b and a ≠ -b, then x = (a, b) would work. For example, take a = 1, b = 2. Then, both components are non-zero. So, even though x = (1,1) leads to a zero in the first component, another x with non-zero entries can work.

Therefore, in 2D, even if the rotation matrix can map some non-zero vectors to ones with zeros, there still exist vectors with no zero entries that are mapped to vectors with no zero entries. So, maybe in general, such vectors exist?

Alternatively, maybe we can use a density argument. The set of vectors with no zero entries is dense in R^n. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also dense, since it&#x27;s the complement of the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P. Since the union of hyperplanes has measure zero, their complement is dense. Therefore, the intersection of these two sets (vectors with no zero entries such that Px also has none) is also dense, hence non-empty.

Wait, that might be a more abstract way to see it. Let me elaborate. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the coordinate hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. Each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is a closed set with empty interior. Similarly, the set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}, where p_i are the rows of P. Again, each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is closed with empty interior. Therefore, both complements are open and dense in R^n. The intersection of two open dense sets is also open and dense, hence non-empty. Therefore, there must exist vectors x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, since the rows of P form an orthonormal basis, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are n distinct hyperplanes. The set of vectors not lying in any of these hyperplanes is the complement of their union, which is dense. Similarly, the set of vectors with no zero entries is the complement of the union of coordinate hyperplanes, also dense. The intersection of these two dense sets is non-empty by the Baire Category Theorem, which states that in a complete metric space (like R^n), the intersection of countably many dense open sets is dense. Since we&#x27;re dealing with finite unions of hyperplanes, the complements are open and dense, so their intersection is dense, hence non-empty.

Therefore, such a vector x must exist. Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector exists.

Wait, but let me test this with a specific example. Suppose P is the identity matrix. Then, the rows are the standard basis vectors. So, the hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. The set of vectors with no zero entries is exactly the complement of the union of these hyperplanes. So, in this case, the vectors x with no zero entries are exactly those for which Px (which is x itself) has no zero entries. So, in this case, the two conditions are the same, so the intersection is the same set, which is non-empty. So, works here.

Another example: Let P be a permutation matrix. Then, as before, x with all non-zero entries will be permuted, so Px will have the same entries as x but in different order. Therefore, Px will also have no zero entries. Therefore, in this case, any x with no zero entries works. So, definitely exists.

Another example: Take P to be a rotation matrix in 3D. Suppose we rotate around some axis. Then, similar to the 2D case, can we find a vector x with all non-zero entries such that Px also has all non-zero entries? Let&#x27;s see. Let’s take x = (1,1,1). If we rotate x by some angle, the result might not have any zero entries, depending on the rotation. But even if it does, we can perturb x slightly to avoid zeros. For example, if rotating x = (1,1,1) by 90 degrees around the z-axis gives ( -1, 1, 1), which still has no zeros. Wait, but a 90 degree rotation around z-axis would send (x, y, z) to (-y, x, z). So, x = (1,1,1) becomes (-1, 1, 1), which indeed has no zeros. So in this case, it works. But maybe another rotation could cause a zero? Suppose we have a rotation that aligns a vector with an axis. Wait, but if we rotate a vector with all non-zero entries, would it ever result in a zero? For example, rotating (1,1,1) around some axis by some angle. If the rotation is such that one component becomes zero, then that would require that vector to be orthogonal to one of the coordinate axes, but (1,1,1) is not orthogonal to any coordinate axis unless we have specific rotations. Wait, but actually, any rotation is an orthogonal transformation, but to get a zero component, you would need the rotated vector to lie on a coordinate hyperplane. However, if the original vector is not on any rotated hyperplane corresponding to the coordinate axes, then the rotated vector won&#x27;t have zeros. But perhaps this is too vague.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider specific angles. Suppose we rotate (1,1,1) by 45 degrees around some axis. Depending on the axis, this might or might not introduce zeros. But maybe choosing an axis that isn&#x27;t aligned with the coordinate axes. For example, rotating around the vector (1,1,1) itself by some angle. Then, the vector (1,1,1) would remain unchanged, so no zeros. If we rotate around another axis, say (1,0,0), by 45 degrees. Then, the rotation in the y-z plane. The x-component remains 1, and y and z components become (y cosθ - z sinθ, y sinθ + z cosθ). So, with θ = 45 degrees, y and z components become ( (y - z)/√2, (y + z)/√2 ). If original x is (1,1,1), then after rotation, it becomes (1, (1 - 1)/√2 = 0, (1 + 1)/√2 = √2 ). So, the y-component becomes zero. Oh, so in this case, rotating (1,1,1) around the x-axis by 45 degrees results in a vector with a zero entry. But then, does that mean that for this particular rotation matrix, the vector x = (1,1,1) leads to Px having a zero? But the question is whether there exists some x with no zero entries such that Px also has none. In this case, even though (1,1,1) doesn&#x27;t work, maybe another vector does. For example, take x = (1, 2, 1). Then, rotating around x-axis by 45 degrees gives (1, (2 - 1)/√2, (2 + 1)/√2 ) = (1, 1/√2, 3/√2 ), which has no zeros. So, yes, such a vector exists. So even if some vectors lead to zeros after transformation, others don&#x27;t.

This seems to support the idea that regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, we can always find such a vector x. The key idea is that the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P and the coordinate hyperplanes have measure zero, so their complements intersect.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the set S of vectors x with no zero entries. This is an open set in R^n (since it&#x27;s the complement of the closed set where at least one coordinate is zero). Similarly, the set T of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open, as it&#x27;s the complement of the union of hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}. Since P is orthogonal, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are distinct from the coordinate hyperplanes if P is not a permutation matrix. But even if they overlap, the important thing is that both S and T are open and dense. The intersection of two open dense sets is non-empty in R^n, as R^n is a Baire space. Therefore, S ∩ T ≠ ∅, meaning there exists a vector x in both S and T, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of linear algebra, suppose we want to find x such that x_i ≠ 0 for all i, and (Px)_j ≠ 0 for all j. Let me try to construct such an x. Since P is invertible (orthogonal matrices are invertible), the mapping x ↦ Px is a bijection. Therefore, the image of the set S (vectors with no zero entries) under P is the same as the set T. Since S is open and dense, and P is a homeomorphism (continuous bijection with continuous inverse), then T = P(S) is also open and dense. Therefore, T ∩ S is the intersection of two open dense sets, which must be non-empty. Therefore, there exists x in S such that Px is also in S, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, this seems like a solid argument. Since S is open and dense, and T = P(S) is also open and dense, their intersection is non-empty. Therefore, yes, such an x exists.

But let me check if this reasoning holds. If S is the set of vectors with no zero entries, and T is the set of vectors y such that y = Px has no zero entries, which is equivalent to x = P^T y having no zero entries? Wait, no. T is the set of x such that Px has no zero entries. So, T = {x | Px ∈ S}. Since P is invertible, T = P^{-1}(S). Since S is open and dense, and P^{-1} is a homeomorphism, T is also open and dense. Therefore, S and T are both open and dense, so their intersection is non-empty.

Therefore, there exists x ∈ S ∩ T, which means x has no zero entries, and Px also has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector x exists.

But let me see if I can construct such a vector explicitly. Suppose we take a vector x with all entries equal to 1. Then, Px is the sum of the columns of P. Wait, no, if x is all ones, then Px is the sum of the columns of P scaled by 1. But the columns of P are orthonormal. The sum of the columns of P would be a vector whose norm squared is n, since each column is a unit vector and they are orthogonal. So, the sum would have norm sqrt(n). But does the sum have any zero entries? Not necessarily. For example, if P is the identity matrix, then the sum is (1,1,...,1), which has no zeros. If P is a permutation matrix, the sum is also (1,1,...,1). If P is a rotation matrix, the sum could be different. For instance, in 2D, if P is a rotation by θ, then the sum of the columns would be [cosθ + (-sinθ), sinθ + cosθ], which is [cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ]. For θ = 45 degrees, this becomes [0, √2], which has a zero. So, in that case, x being all ones would result in Px having a zero. But as we saw before, if we take x = (1, 2), then Px might not have any zeros. So, the all-ones vector might not work, but another vector might.

Alternatively, maybe a vector with all entries positive. Since if all entries are positive, then Px is a linear combination of the columns of P with positive coefficients. But the columns of P are orthonormal, so they form a basis. If all coefficients are positive, can such a combination result in a zero entry? Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a vector x with all positive entries such that Px has a zero entry. Then, the zero entry corresponds to a row of P (since Px is computed by row-wise dot products). So, there exists a row p_i of P such that p_i ⋅ x = 0. But x has all positive entries, and p_i is a unit vector. However, the dot product being zero would mean that p_i is orthogonal to x. But since x is in the positive orthant, and p_i is a unit vector, is it possible for p_i to be orthogonal to x?

Yes, it&#x27;s possible. For example, take p_i = (1, -1, 0, ..., 0)/sqrt(2). Then, the dot product with x = (1,1,1,...,1) would be (1 - 1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + ... + 0 = 0. So, even with x having all positive entries, p_i ⋅ x can be zero. Therefore, just having positive entries is not sufficient. But the question is whether there exists some x with all non-zero entries (not necessarily all positive) such that p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0 for all i.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the function f(x) = (Px)_1 * (Px)_2 * ... * (Px)_n * x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_n. We need to find x such that f(x) ≠ 0. Since f is the product of all entries of Px and all entries of x, it&#x27;s a polynomial in the entries of x. The set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the hyperplanes {x_i = 0} and {p_i ⋅ x = 0} for each i. Since we are in R^n, and the zero set of a non-zero polynomial has measure zero, but f is the product of 2n linear terms, which is a non-zero polynomial. Wait, but actually, f(x) is the product of n terms from Px and n terms from x, so total degree 2n. However, the set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the 2n hyperplanes. But since these hyperplanes are all of codimension 1, their union is a closed set with empty interior. Therefore, the complement, where f(x) ≠ 0, is open and dense. Therefore, there exist vectors x where f(x) ≠ 0, which means all entries of x and all entries of Px are non-zero. Hence, such vectors exist.

This again confirms that the answer is yes.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for each row p_i of P, the hyperplane p_i ⋅ x = 0 does not contain any of the coordinate hyperplanes x_j = 0, unless p_i is aligned with some coordinate axis. But since P is orthogonal, if any row p_i were aligned with a coordinate axis, then the corresponding column would also be that axis vector, making P a permutation matrix (possibly with sign changes). But even if P is a permutation matrix with sign changes (i.e., generalized permutation matrix), then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 correspond to x_j = 0 for some j, depending on the permutation and sign. However, in such a case, avoiding those hyperplanes would correspond to avoiding certain coordinate hyperplanes. But if P is a generalized permutation matrix, then Px is just a permutation of x with possible sign changes. Therefore, if we choose x with all entries non-zero, then Px will also have all entries non-zero, since permutation and sign changes don&#x27;t introduce zeros. Therefore, in that case, any x with no zero entries works. 

If P is not a generalized permutation matrix, then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 are not coordinate hyperplanes, so the union of these hyperplanes and the coordinate hyperplanes is a union of 2n distinct hyperplanes (assuming no overlap). However, even if there is overlap, the key point is that the union is a closed set with empty interior, so the complement is open and dense. Therefore, regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, the existence of such an x is guaranteed.

To summarize:

1. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is open and dense.
2. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open and dense.
3. The intersection of these two sets is non-empty due to the Baire Category Theorem.
4. Therefore, there must exist at least one vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Therefore, the answer is yes, such a vector x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given an orthogonal matrix \( P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \), we need to determine whether there exists a vector \( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \) with no zero entries such that \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

1. **Orthogonal Matrix Properties**: An orthogonal matrix \( P \) has orthonormal rows and columns, meaning \( P^T P = I \). This implies that the rows of \( P \) form an orthonormal basis for \( \mathbb{R}^n \).

2. **Hyperplanes Consideration**: We need a vector \( x \) such that both \( x \) and \( Px \) have no zero entries. This translates to finding \( x \) such that \( x \) is not orthogonal to any row of \( P \), i.e., \( p_i \cdot x \neq 0 \) for all rows \( p_i \) of \( P \).

3. **Dense Sets Argument**: 
   - The set of vectors with no zero entries (complement of coordinate hyperplanes) is open and dense in \( \mathbb{R}^n \).
   - The set of vectors \( x \) such that \( Px \) has no zero entries (complement of hyperplanes orthogonal to rows of \( P \)) is also open and dense.

4. **Intersection of Dense Sets**: By the Baire Category Theorem, the intersection of two open dense sets in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) is non-empty. Therefore, there exists a vector \( x \) that lies in both sets, meaning \( x \) has no zero entries and \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

5. **Conclusion**: The existence of such a vector \( x \) is guaranteed by the density and openness arguments, confirming that the required vector exists for any orthogonal matrix \( P \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem: Given an orthogonal matrix P in R^{n x n}, does there exist a vector x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries? Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall what an orthogonal matrix is. An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix whose columns and rows are orthonormal vectors. That means P^T P = I, where P^T is the transpose of P and I is the identity matrix. So, the inverse of P is just its transpose. Orthogonal matrices preserve the dot product, so they preserve angles and lengths. That means transformations like rotations and reflections are orthogonal.

Now, the question is about whether there&#x27;s a vector x with all non-zero entries such that when we multiply it by P, the resulting vector also has all non-zero entries. So, both x and Px must have no zeros in any of their components. 

Let me rephrase the problem: We need to find a vector x in R^n with all entries non-zero such that none of the entries of Px are zero. Alternatively, for each row of P, the dot product with x is non-zero. So, for each row vector p_i of P, p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0. So, the problem reduces to finding an x with all entries non-zero that is not orthogonal to any of the rows of P.

Since P is orthogonal, its rows form an orthonormal basis for R^n. So, the rows are unit vectors and mutually orthogonal. But we need a vector x that is not orthogonal to any of these rows. So, x cannot be orthogonal to any row of P.

But is such an x guaranteed to exist? Hmm. Let me think. In R^n, given a finite set of vectors (in this case, n orthonormal vectors), does there exist a vector that is not orthogonal to any of them?

Alternatively, the question is: Can we find a vector x such that for each i from 1 to n, the inner product of x with the i-th row of P is not zero. Since the rows are orthonormal, they form a basis. So, x can be expressed in terms of this basis. But x is in R^n, so any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the rows. Wait, but the rows themselves are orthonormal, so if we express x as a combination of the rows, then the coefficients would just be the inner products of x with each row. But if we require that all those coefficients are non-zero, then x must have a non-zero component in each row direction. So, in other words, if we write x = c_1 p_1 + c_2 p_2 + ... + c_n p_n, where p_i are the rows of P, then all c_i must be non-zero. But since the rows of P form a basis, any x can be written this way, and we can choose the coefficients c_i to be non-zero. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, but hold on. If we set x to be the sum of all the rows with coefficients 1, then x = p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n, and then Px would be... Wait, no, P is the matrix whose rows are p_i, so multiplying P by x would give us a vector where each component is p_i ⋅ x. But if x is the sum of all p_j, then p_i ⋅ x = p_i ⋅ (p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n) = p_i ⋅ p_i + sum_{j ≠ i} p_i ⋅ p_j. Since the rows are orthonormal, p_i ⋅ p_j = δ_{ij}, so this simplifies to 1 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1. So, Px would be a vector of all ones. Therefore, in that case, x = p_1 + ... + p_n would have Px = (1,1,...,1)^T, which has no zero entries. But wait, does x itself have non-zero entries? Not necessarily. If the sum of the rows of P results in a vector with all non-zero entries, then we&#x27;re done. But maybe in some cases, the sum of the rows could have a zero entry. For example, if P is a permutation matrix, say swapping two coordinates, then the sum of the rows would be (1,1), which in higher dimensions might still have all entries non-zero? Wait, no, a permutation matrix in higher dimensions just permutes the entries. So, if you sum all the rows of a permutation matrix, you would get a vector of all ones, right? Because each row has a single 1 and the rest zeros, and summing all rows would give a vector with n ones. So, in that case, x would be the vector of all ones, which has no zero entries, and Px would also be the vector of all ones, since permutation matrices just permute the entries. Wait, no. If x is all ones, then Px would permute the entries of x, which are all ones, so Px would still be all ones. So, in that case, both x and Px have all entries non-zero.

But wait, this seems too specific. What if P is a different orthogonal matrix? For example, suppose P is a rotation matrix in 2D. Let&#x27;s take n=2. Then, a rotation matrix is orthogonal. Suppose we have a rotation by some angle θ. Then, is there a vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries?

Well, let&#x27;s take x = (1,1). Then, Px would be (cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ). Are there θ such that either component is zero? For example, if θ = 45 degrees, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. Then, Px would be (0, √2). So, the first component is zero. Oh, so in this case, x = (1,1) would result in Px having a zero entry. But does there exist another x with no zero entries such that Px also has none?

Suppose we take x = (a, b) with a, b ≠ 0. Then, Px = (a cosθ - b sinθ, a sinθ + b cosθ). For this to have no zeros, we need a cosθ - b sinθ ≠ 0 and a sinθ + b cosθ ≠ 0.

So, can we choose a and b such that these are satisfied? Let&#x27;s see. If θ is 45 degrees, as above, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. So, the first component becomes (a - b)√2/2 and the second component becomes (a + b)√2/2. So, to have both components non-zero, we need a ≠ b and a ≠ -b. So, as long as a ≠ b and a ≠ -b, then x = (a, b) would work. For example, take a = 1, b = 2. Then, both components are non-zero. So, even though x = (1,1) leads to a zero in the first component, another x with non-zero entries can work.

Therefore, in 2D, even if the rotation matrix can map some non-zero vectors to ones with zeros, there still exist vectors with no zero entries that are mapped to vectors with no zero entries. So, maybe in general, such vectors exist?

Alternatively, maybe we can use a density argument. The set of vectors with no zero entries is dense in R^n. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also dense, since it&#x27;s the complement of the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P. Since the union of hyperplanes has measure zero, their complement is dense. Therefore, the intersection of these two sets (vectors with no zero entries such that Px also has none) is also dense, hence non-empty.

Wait, that might be a more abstract way to see it. Let me elaborate. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the coordinate hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. Each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is a closed set with empty interior. Similarly, the set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}, where p_i are the rows of P. Again, each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is closed with empty interior. Therefore, both complements are open and dense in R^n. The intersection of two open dense sets is also open and dense, hence non-empty. Therefore, there must exist vectors x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, since the rows of P form an orthonormal basis, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are n distinct hyperplanes. The set of vectors not lying in any of these hyperplanes is the complement of their union, which is dense. Similarly, the set of vectors with no zero entries is the complement of the union of coordinate hyperplanes, also dense. The intersection of these two dense sets is non-empty by the Baire Category Theorem, which states that in a complete metric space (like R^n), the intersection of countably many dense open sets is dense. Since we&#x27;re dealing with finite unions of hyperplanes, the complements are open and dense, so their intersection is dense, hence non-empty.

Therefore, such a vector x must exist. Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector exists.

Wait, but let me test this with a specific example. Suppose P is the identity matrix. Then, the rows are the standard basis vectors. So, the hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. The set of vectors with no zero entries is exactly the complement of the union of these hyperplanes. So, in this case, the vectors x with no zero entries are exactly those for which Px (which is x itself) has no zero entries. So, in this case, the two conditions are the same, so the intersection is the same set, which is non-empty. So, works here.

Another example: Let P be a permutation matrix. Then, as before, x with all non-zero entries will be permuted, so Px will have the same entries as x but in different order. Therefore, Px will also have no zero entries. Therefore, in this case, any x with no zero entries works. So, definitely exists.

Another example: Take P to be a rotation matrix in 3D. Suppose we rotate around some axis. Then, similar to the 2D case, can we find a vector x with all non-zero entries such that Px also has all non-zero entries? Let&#x27;s see. Let’s take x = (1,1,1). If we rotate x by some angle, the result might not have any zero entries, depending on the rotation. But even if it does, we can perturb x slightly to avoid zeros. For example, if rotating x = (1,1,1) by 90 degrees around the z-axis gives ( -1, 1, 1), which still has no zeros. Wait, but a 90 degree rotation around z-axis would send (x, y, z) to (-y, x, z). So, x = (1,1,1) becomes (-1, 1, 1), which indeed has no zeros. So in this case, it works. But maybe another rotation could cause a zero? Suppose we have a rotation that aligns a vector with an axis. Wait, but if we rotate a vector with all non-zero entries, would it ever result in a zero? For example, rotating (1,1,1) around some axis by some angle. If the rotation is such that one component becomes zero, then that would require that vector to be orthogonal to one of the coordinate axes, but (1,1,1) is not orthogonal to any coordinate axis unless we have specific rotations. Wait, but actually, any rotation is an orthogonal transformation, but to get a zero component, you would need the rotated vector to lie on a coordinate hyperplane. However, if the original vector is not on any rotated hyperplane corresponding to the coordinate axes, then the rotated vector won&#x27;t have zeros. But perhaps this is too vague.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider specific angles. Suppose we rotate (1,1,1) by 45 degrees around some axis. Depending on the axis, this might or might not introduce zeros. But maybe choosing an axis that isn&#x27;t aligned with the coordinate axes. For example, rotating around the vector (1,1,1) itself by some angle. Then, the vector (1,1,1) would remain unchanged, so no zeros. If we rotate around another axis, say (1,0,0), by 45 degrees. Then, the rotation in the y-z plane. The x-component remains 1, and y and z components become (y cosθ - z sinθ, y sinθ + z cosθ). So, with θ = 45 degrees, y and z components become ( (y - z)/√2, (y + z)/√2 ). If original x is (1,1,1), then after rotation, it becomes (1, (1 - 1)/√2 = 0, (1 + 1)/√2 = √2 ). So, the y-component becomes zero. Oh, so in this case, rotating (1,1,1) around the x-axis by 45 degrees results in a vector with a zero entry. But then, does that mean that for this particular rotation matrix, the vector x = (1,1,1) leads to Px having a zero? But the question is whether there exists some x with no zero entries such that Px also has none. In this case, even though (1,1,1) doesn&#x27;t work, maybe another vector does. For example, take x = (1, 2, 1). Then, rotating around x-axis by 45 degrees gives (1, (2 - 1)/√2, (2 + 1)/√2 ) = (1, 1/√2, 3/√2 ), which has no zeros. So, yes, such a vector exists. So even if some vectors lead to zeros after transformation, others don&#x27;t.

This seems to support the idea that regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, we can always find such a vector x. The key idea is that the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P and the coordinate hyperplanes have measure zero, so their complements intersect.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the set S of vectors x with no zero entries. This is an open set in R^n (since it&#x27;s the complement of the closed set where at least one coordinate is zero). Similarly, the set T of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open, as it&#x27;s the complement of the union of hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}. Since P is orthogonal, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are distinct from the coordinate hyperplanes if P is not a permutation matrix. But even if they overlap, the important thing is that both S and T are open and dense. The intersection of two open dense sets is non-empty in R^n, as R^n is a Baire space. Therefore, S ∩ T ≠ ∅, meaning there exists a vector x in both S and T, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of linear algebra, suppose we want to find x such that x_i ≠ 0 for all i, and (Px)_j ≠ 0 for all j. Let me try to construct such an x. Since P is invertible (orthogonal matrices are invertible), the mapping x ↦ Px is a bijection. Therefore, the image of the set S (vectors with no zero entries) under P is the same as the set T. Since S is open and dense, and P is a homeomorphism (continuous bijection with continuous inverse), then T = P(S) is also open and dense. Therefore, T ∩ S is the intersection of two open dense sets, which must be non-empty. Therefore, there exists x in S such that Px is also in S, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, this seems like a solid argument. Since S is open and dense, and T = P(S) is also open and dense, their intersection is non-empty. Therefore, yes, such an x exists.

But let me check if this reasoning holds. If S is the set of vectors with no zero entries, and T is the set of vectors y such that y = Px has no zero entries, which is equivalent to x = P^T y having no zero entries? Wait, no. T is the set of x such that Px has no zero entries. So, T = {x | Px ∈ S}. Since P is invertible, T = P^{-1}(S). Since S is open and dense, and P^{-1} is a homeomorphism, T is also open and dense. Therefore, S and T are both open and dense, so their intersection is non-empty.

Therefore, there exists x ∈ S ∩ T, which means x has no zero entries, and Px also has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector x exists.

But let me see if I can construct such a vector explicitly. Suppose we take a vector x with all entries equal to 1. Then, Px is the sum of the columns of P. Wait, no, if x is all ones, then Px is the sum of the columns of P scaled by 1. But the columns of P are orthonormal. The sum of the columns of P would be a vector whose norm squared is n, since each column is a unit vector and they are orthogonal. So, the sum would have norm sqrt(n). But does the sum have any zero entries? Not necessarily. For example, if P is the identity matrix, then the sum is (1,1,...,1), which has no zeros. If P is a permutation matrix, the sum is also (1,1,...,1). If P is a rotation matrix, the sum could be different. For instance, in 2D, if P is a rotation by θ, then the sum of the columns would be [cosθ + (-sinθ), sinθ + cosθ], which is [cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ]. For θ = 45 degrees, this becomes [0, √2], which has a zero. So, in that case, x being all ones would result in Px having a zero. But as we saw before, if we take x = (1, 2), then Px might not have any zeros. So, the all-ones vector might not work, but another vector might.

Alternatively, maybe a vector with all entries positive. Since if all entries are positive, then Px is a linear combination of the columns of P with positive coefficients. But the columns of P are orthonormal, so they form a basis. If all coefficients are positive, can such a combination result in a zero entry? Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a vector x with all positive entries such that Px has a zero entry. Then, the zero entry corresponds to a row of P (since Px is computed by row-wise dot products). So, there exists a row p_i of P such that p_i ⋅ x = 0. But x has all positive entries, and p_i is a unit vector. However, the dot product being zero would mean that p_i is orthogonal to x. But since x is in the positive orthant, and p_i is a unit vector, is it possible for p_i to be orthogonal to x?

Yes, it&#x27;s possible. For example, take p_i = (1, -1, 0, ..., 0)/sqrt(2). Then, the dot product with x = (1,1,1,...,1) would be (1 - 1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + ... + 0 = 0. So, even with x having all positive entries, p_i ⋅ x can be zero. Therefore, just having positive entries is not sufficient. But the question is whether there exists some x with all non-zero entries (not necessarily all positive) such that p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0 for all i.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the function f(x) = (Px)_1 * (Px)_2 * ... * (Px)_n * x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_n. We need to find x such that f(x) ≠ 0. Since f is the product of all entries of Px and all entries of x, it&#x27;s a polynomial in the entries of x. The set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the hyperplanes {x_i = 0} and {p_i ⋅ x = 0} for each i. Since we are in R^n, and the zero set of a non-zero polynomial has measure zero, but f is the product of 2n linear terms, which is a non-zero polynomial. Wait, but actually, f(x) is the product of n terms from Px and n terms from x, so total degree 2n. However, the set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the 2n hyperplanes. But since these hyperplanes are all of codimension 1, their union is a closed set with empty interior. Therefore, the complement, where f(x) ≠ 0, is open and dense. Therefore, there exist vectors x where f(x) ≠ 0, which means all entries of x and all entries of Px are non-zero. Hence, such vectors exist.

This again confirms that the answer is yes.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for each row p_i of P, the hyperplane p_i ⋅ x = 0 does not contain any of the coordinate hyperplanes x_j = 0, unless p_i is aligned with some coordinate axis. But since P is orthogonal, if any row p_i were aligned with a coordinate axis, then the corresponding column would also be that axis vector, making P a permutation matrix (possibly with sign changes). But even if P is a permutation matrix with sign changes (i.e., generalized permutation matrix), then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 correspond to x_j = 0 for some j, depending on the permutation and sign. However, in such a case, avoiding those hyperplanes would correspond to avoiding certain coordinate hyperplanes. But if P is a generalized permutation matrix, then Px is just a permutation of x with possible sign changes. Therefore, if we choose x with all entries non-zero, then Px will also have all entries non-zero, since permutation and sign changes don&#x27;t introduce zeros. Therefore, in that case, any x with no zero entries works. 

If P is not a generalized permutation matrix, then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 are not coordinate hyperplanes, so the union of these hyperplanes and the coordinate hyperplanes is a union of 2n distinct hyperplanes (assuming no overlap). However, even if there is overlap, the key point is that the union is a closed set with empty interior, so the complement is open and dense. Therefore, regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, the existence of such an x is guaranteed.

To summarize:

1. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is open and dense.
2. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open and dense.
3. The intersection of these two sets is non-empty due to the Baire Category Theorem.
4. Therefore, there must exist at least one vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Therefore, the answer is yes, such a vector x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given an orthogonal matrix \( P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \), we need to determine whether there exists a vector \( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \) with no zero entries such that \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

1. **Orthogonal Matrix Properties**: An orthogonal matrix \( P \) has orthonormal rows and columns, meaning \( P^T P = I \). This implies that the rows of \( P \) form an orthonormal basis for \( \mathbb{R}^n \).

2. **Hyperplanes Consideration**: We need a vector \( x \) such that both \( x \) and \( Px \) have no zero entries. This translates to finding \( x \) such that \( x \) is not orthogonal to any row of \( P \), i.e., \( p_i \cdot x \neq 0 \) for all rows \( p_i \) of \( P \).

3. **Dense Sets Argument**: 
   - The set of vectors with no zero entries (complement of coordinate hyperplanes) is open and dense in \( \mathbb{R}^n \).
   - The set of vectors \( x \) such that \( Px \) has no zero entries (complement of hyperplanes orthogonal to rows of \( P \)) is also open and dense.

4. **Intersection of Dense Sets**: By the Baire Category Theorem, the intersection of two open dense sets in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) is non-empty. Therefore, there exists a vector \( x \) that lies in both sets, meaning \( x \) has no zero entries and \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

5. **Conclusion**: The existence of such a vector \( x \) is guaranteed by the density and openness arguments, confirming that the required vector exists for any orthogonal matrix \( P \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem: Given an orthogonal matrix P in R^{n x n}, does there exist a vector x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries? Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall what an orthogonal matrix is. An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix whose columns and rows are orthonormal vectors. That means P^T P = I, where P^T is the transpose of P and I is the identity matrix. So, the inverse of P is just its transpose. Orthogonal matrices preserve the dot product, so they preserve angles and lengths. That means transformations like rotations and reflections are orthogonal.

Now, the question is about whether there&#x27;s a vector x with all non-zero entries such that when we multiply it by P, the resulting vector also has all non-zero entries. So, both x and Px must have no zeros in any of their components. 

Let me rephrase the problem: We need to find a vector x in R^n with all entries non-zero such that none of the entries of Px are zero. Alternatively, for each row of P, the dot product with x is non-zero. So, for each row vector p_i of P, p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0. So, the problem reduces to finding an x with all entries non-zero that is not orthogonal to any of the rows of P.

Since P is orthogonal, its rows form an orthonormal basis for R^n. So, the rows are unit vectors and mutually orthogonal. But we need a vector x that is not orthogonal to any of these rows. So, x cannot be orthogonal to any row of P.

But is such an x guaranteed to exist? Hmm. Let me think. In R^n, given a finite set of vectors (in this case, n orthonormal vectors), does there exist a vector that is not orthogonal to any of them?

Alternatively, the question is: Can we find a vector x such that for each i from 1 to n, the inner product of x with the i-th row of P is not zero. Since the rows are orthonormal, they form a basis. So, x can be expressed in terms of this basis. But x is in R^n, so any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the rows. Wait, but the rows themselves are orthonormal, so if we express x as a combination of the rows, then the coefficients would just be the inner products of x with each row. But if we require that all those coefficients are non-zero, then x must have a non-zero component in each row direction. So, in other words, if we write x = c_1 p_1 + c_2 p_2 + ... + c_n p_n, where p_i are the rows of P, then all c_i must be non-zero. But since the rows of P form a basis, any x can be written this way, and we can choose the coefficients c_i to be non-zero. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, but hold on. If we set x to be the sum of all the rows with coefficients 1, then x = p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n, and then Px would be... Wait, no, P is the matrix whose rows are p_i, so multiplying P by x would give us a vector where each component is p_i ⋅ x. But if x is the sum of all p_j, then p_i ⋅ x = p_i ⋅ (p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n) = p_i ⋅ p_i + sum_{j ≠ i} p_i ⋅ p_j. Since the rows are orthonormal, p_i ⋅ p_j = δ_{ij}, so this simplifies to 1 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1. So, Px would be a vector of all ones. Therefore, in that case, x = p_1 + ... + p_n would have Px = (1,1,...,1)^T, which has no zero entries. But wait, does x itself have non-zero entries? Not necessarily. If the sum of the rows of P results in a vector with all non-zero entries, then we&#x27;re done. But maybe in some cases, the sum of the rows could have a zero entry. For example, if P is a permutation matrix, say swapping two coordinates, then the sum of the rows would be (1,1), which in higher dimensions might still have all entries non-zero? Wait, no, a permutation matrix in higher dimensions just permutes the entries. So, if you sum all the rows of a permutation matrix, you would get a vector of all ones, right? Because each row has a single 1 and the rest zeros, and summing all rows would give a vector with n ones. So, in that case, x would be the vector of all ones, which has no zero entries, and Px would also be the vector of all ones, since permutation matrices just permute the entries. Wait, no. If x is all ones, then Px would permute the entries of x, which are all ones, so Px would still be all ones. So, in that case, both x and Px have all entries non-zero.

But wait, this seems too specific. What if P is a different orthogonal matrix? For example, suppose P is a rotation matrix in 2D. Let&#x27;s take n=2. Then, a rotation matrix is orthogonal. Suppose we have a rotation by some angle θ. Then, is there a vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries?

Well, let&#x27;s take x = (1,1). Then, Px would be (cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ). Are there θ such that either component is zero? For example, if θ = 45 degrees, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. Then, Px would be (0, √2). So, the first component is zero. Oh, so in this case, x = (1,1) would result in Px having a zero entry. But does there exist another x with no zero entries such that Px also has none?

Suppose we take x = (a, b) with a, b ≠ 0. Then, Px = (a cosθ - b sinθ, a sinθ + b cosθ). For this to have no zeros, we need a cosθ - b sinθ ≠ 0 and a sinθ + b cosθ ≠ 0.

So, can we choose a and b such that these are satisfied? Let&#x27;s see. If θ is 45 degrees, as above, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. So, the first component becomes (a - b)√2/2 and the second component becomes (a + b)√2/2. So, to have both components non-zero, we need a ≠ b and a ≠ -b. So, as long as a ≠ b and a ≠ -b, then x = (a, b) would work. For example, take a = 1, b = 2. Then, both components are non-zero. So, even though x = (1,1) leads to a zero in the first component, another x with non-zero entries can work.

Therefore, in 2D, even if the rotation matrix can map some non-zero vectors to ones with zeros, there still exist vectors with no zero entries that are mapped to vectors with no zero entries. So, maybe in general, such vectors exist?

Alternatively, maybe we can use a density argument. The set of vectors with no zero entries is dense in R^n. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also dense, since it&#x27;s the complement of the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P. Since the union of hyperplanes has measure zero, their complement is dense. Therefore, the intersection of these two sets (vectors with no zero entries such that Px also has none) is also dense, hence non-empty.

Wait, that might be a more abstract way to see it. Let me elaborate. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the coordinate hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. Each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is a closed set with empty interior. Similarly, the set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}, where p_i are the rows of P. Again, each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is closed with empty interior. Therefore, both complements are open and dense in R^n. The intersection of two open dense sets is also open and dense, hence non-empty. Therefore, there must exist vectors x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, since the rows of P form an orthonormal basis, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are n distinct hyperplanes. The set of vectors not lying in any of these hyperplanes is the complement of their union, which is dense. Similarly, the set of vectors with no zero entries is the complement of the union of coordinate hyperplanes, also dense. The intersection of these two dense sets is non-empty by the Baire Category Theorem, which states that in a complete metric space (like R^n), the intersection of countably many dense open sets is dense. Since we&#x27;re dealing with finite unions of hyperplanes, the complements are open and dense, so their intersection is dense, hence non-empty.

Therefore, such a vector x must exist. Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector exists.

Wait, but let me test this with a specific example. Suppose P is the identity matrix. Then, the rows are the standard basis vectors. So, the hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. The set of vectors with no zero entries is exactly the complement of the union of these hyperplanes. So, in this case, the vectors x with no zero entries are exactly those for which Px (which is x itself) has no zero entries. So, in this case, the two conditions are the same, so the intersection is the same set, which is non-empty. So, works here.

Another example: Let P be a permutation matrix. Then, as before, x with all non-zero entries will be permuted, so Px will have the same entries as x but in different order. Therefore, Px will also have no zero entries. Therefore, in this case, any x with no zero entries works. So, definitely exists.

Another example: Take P to be a rotation matrix in 3D. Suppose we rotate around some axis. Then, similar to the 2D case, can we find a vector x with all non-zero entries such that Px also has all non-zero entries? Let&#x27;s see. Let’s take x = (1,1,1). If we rotate x by some angle, the result might not have any zero entries, depending on the rotation. But even if it does, we can perturb x slightly to avoid zeros. For example, if rotating x = (1,1,1) by 90 degrees around the z-axis gives ( -1, 1, 1), which still has no zeros. Wait, but a 90 degree rotation around z-axis would send (x, y, z) to (-y, x, z). So, x = (1,1,1) becomes (-1, 1, 1), which indeed has no zeros. So in this case, it works. But maybe another rotation could cause a zero? Suppose we have a rotation that aligns a vector with an axis. Wait, but if we rotate a vector with all non-zero entries, would it ever result in a zero? For example, rotating (1,1,1) around some axis by some angle. If the rotation is such that one component becomes zero, then that would require that vector to be orthogonal to one of the coordinate axes, but (1,1,1) is not orthogonal to any coordinate axis unless we have specific rotations. Wait, but actually, any rotation is an orthogonal transformation, but to get a zero component, you would need the rotated vector to lie on a coordinate hyperplane. However, if the original vector is not on any rotated hyperplane corresponding to the coordinate axes, then the rotated vector won&#x27;t have zeros. But perhaps this is too vague.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider specific angles. Suppose we rotate (1,1,1) by 45 degrees around some axis. Depending on the axis, this might or might not introduce zeros. But maybe choosing an axis that isn&#x27;t aligned with the coordinate axes. For example, rotating around the vector (1,1,1) itself by some angle. Then, the vector (1,1,1) would remain unchanged, so no zeros. If we rotate around another axis, say (1,0,0), by 45 degrees. Then, the rotation in the y-z plane. The x-component remains 1, and y and z components become (y cosθ - z sinθ, y sinθ + z cosθ). So, with θ = 45 degrees, y and z components become ( (y - z)/√2, (y + z)/√2 ). If original x is (1,1,1), then after rotation, it becomes (1, (1 - 1)/√2 = 0, (1 + 1)/√2 = √2 ). So, the y-component becomes zero. Oh, so in this case, rotating (1,1,1) around the x-axis by 45 degrees results in a vector with a zero entry. But then, does that mean that for this particular rotation matrix, the vector x = (1,1,1) leads to Px having a zero? But the question is whether there exists some x with no zero entries such that Px also has none. In this case, even though (1,1,1) doesn&#x27;t work, maybe another vector does. For example, take x = (1, 2, 1). Then, rotating around x-axis by 45 degrees gives (1, (2 - 1)/√2, (2 + 1)/√2 ) = (1, 1/√2, 3/√2 ), which has no zeros. So, yes, such a vector exists. So even if some vectors lead to zeros after transformation, others don&#x27;t.

This seems to support the idea that regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, we can always find such a vector x. The key idea is that the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P and the coordinate hyperplanes have measure zero, so their complements intersect.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the set S of vectors x with no zero entries. This is an open set in R^n (since it&#x27;s the complement of the closed set where at least one coordinate is zero). Similarly, the set T of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open, as it&#x27;s the complement of the union of hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}. Since P is orthogonal, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are distinct from the coordinate hyperplanes if P is not a permutation matrix. But even if they overlap, the important thing is that both S and T are open and dense. The intersection of two open dense sets is non-empty in R^n, as R^n is a Baire space. Therefore, S ∩ T ≠ ∅, meaning there exists a vector x in both S and T, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of linear algebra, suppose we want to find x such that x_i ≠ 0 for all i, and (Px)_j ≠ 0 for all j. Let me try to construct such an x. Since P is invertible (orthogonal matrices are invertible), the mapping x ↦ Px is a bijection. Therefore, the image of the set S (vectors with no zero entries) under P is the same as the set T. Since S is open and dense, and P is a homeomorphism (continuous bijection with continuous inverse), then T = P(S) is also open and dense. Therefore, T ∩ S is the intersection of two open dense sets, which must be non-empty. Therefore, there exists x in S such that Px is also in S, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, this seems like a solid argument. Since S is open and dense, and T = P(S) is also open and dense, their intersection is non-empty. Therefore, yes, such an x exists.

But let me check if this reasoning holds. If S is the set of vectors with no zero entries, and T is the set of vectors y such that y = Px has no zero entries, which is equivalent to x = P^T y having no zero entries? Wait, no. T is the set of x such that Px has no zero entries. So, T = {x | Px ∈ S}. Since P is invertible, T = P^{-1}(S). Since S is open and dense, and P^{-1} is a homeomorphism, T is also open and dense. Therefore, S and T are both open and dense, so their intersection is non-empty.

Therefore, there exists x ∈ S ∩ T, which means x has no zero entries, and Px also has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector x exists.

But let me see if I can construct such a vector explicitly. Suppose we take a vector x with all entries equal to 1. Then, Px is the sum of the columns of P. Wait, no, if x is all ones, then Px is the sum of the columns of P scaled by 1. But the columns of P are orthonormal. The sum of the columns of P would be a vector whose norm squared is n, since each column is a unit vector and they are orthogonal. So, the sum would have norm sqrt(n). But does the sum have any zero entries? Not necessarily. For example, if P is the identity matrix, then the sum is (1,1,...,1), which has no zeros. If P is a permutation matrix, the sum is also (1,1,...,1). If P is a rotation matrix, the sum could be different. For instance, in 2D, if P is a rotation by θ, then the sum of the columns would be [cosθ + (-sinθ), sinθ + cosθ], which is [cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ]. For θ = 45 degrees, this becomes [0, √2], which has a zero. So, in that case, x being all ones would result in Px having a zero. But as we saw before, if we take x = (1, 2), then Px might not have any zeros. So, the all-ones vector might not work, but another vector might.

Alternatively, maybe a vector with all entries positive. Since if all entries are positive, then Px is a linear combination of the columns of P with positive coefficients. But the columns of P are orthonormal, so they form a basis. If all coefficients are positive, can such a combination result in a zero entry? Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a vector x with all positive entries such that Px has a zero entry. Then, the zero entry corresponds to a row of P (since Px is computed by row-wise dot products). So, there exists a row p_i of P such that p_i ⋅ x = 0. But x has all positive entries, and p_i is a unit vector. However, the dot product being zero would mean that p_i is orthogonal to x. But since x is in the positive orthant, and p_i is a unit vector, is it possible for p_i to be orthogonal to x?

Yes, it&#x27;s possible. For example, take p_i = (1, -1, 0, ..., 0)/sqrt(2). Then, the dot product with x = (1,1,1,...,1) would be (1 - 1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + ... + 0 = 0. So, even with x having all positive entries, p_i ⋅ x can be zero. Therefore, just having positive entries is not sufficient. But the question is whether there exists some x with all non-zero entries (not necessarily all positive) such that p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0 for all i.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the function f(x) = (Px)_1 * (Px)_2 * ... * (Px)_n * x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_n. We need to find x such that f(x) ≠ 0. Since f is the product of all entries of Px and all entries of x, it&#x27;s a polynomial in the entries of x. The set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the hyperplanes {x_i = 0} and {p_i ⋅ x = 0} for each i. Since we are in R^n, and the zero set of a non-zero polynomial has measure zero, but f is the product of 2n linear terms, which is a non-zero polynomial. Wait, but actually, f(x) is the product of n terms from Px and n terms from x, so total degree 2n. However, the set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the 2n hyperplanes. But since these hyperplanes are all of codimension 1, their union is a closed set with empty interior. Therefore, the complement, where f(x) ≠ 0, is open and dense. Therefore, there exist vectors x where f(x) ≠ 0, which means all entries of x and all entries of Px are non-zero. Hence, such vectors exist.

This again confirms that the answer is yes.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for each row p_i of P, the hyperplane p_i ⋅ x = 0 does not contain any of the coordinate hyperplanes x_j = 0, unless p_i is aligned with some coordinate axis. But since P is orthogonal, if any row p_i were aligned with a coordinate axis, then the corresponding column would also be that axis vector, making P a permutation matrix (possibly with sign changes). But even if P is a permutation matrix with sign changes (i.e., generalized permutation matrix), then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 correspond to x_j = 0 for some j, depending on the permutation and sign. However, in such a case, avoiding those hyperplanes would correspond to avoiding certain coordinate hyperplanes. But if P is a generalized permutation matrix, then Px is just a permutation of x with possible sign changes. Therefore, if we choose x with all entries non-zero, then Px will also have all entries non-zero, since permutation and sign changes don&#x27;t introduce zeros. Therefore, in that case, any x with no zero entries works. 

If P is not a generalized permutation matrix, then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 are not coordinate hyperplanes, so the union of these hyperplanes and the coordinate hyperplanes is a union of 2n distinct hyperplanes (assuming no overlap). However, even if there is overlap, the key point is that the union is a closed set with empty interior, so the complement is open and dense. Therefore, regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, the existence of such an x is guaranteed.

To summarize:

1. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is open and dense.
2. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open and dense.
3. The intersection of these two sets is non-empty due to the Baire Category Theorem.
4. Therefore, there must exist at least one vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Therefore, the answer is yes, such a vector x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given an orthogonal matrix \( P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \), we need to determine whether there exists a vector \( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \) with no zero entries such that \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

1. **Orthogonal Matrix Properties**: An orthogonal matrix \( P \) has orthonormal rows and columns, meaning \( P^T P = I \). This implies that the rows of \( P \) form an orthonormal basis for \( \mathbb{R}^n \).

2. **Hyperplanes Consideration**: We need a vector \( x \) such that both \( x \) and \( Px \) have no zero entries. This translates to finding \( x \) such that \( x \) is not orthogonal to any row of \( P \), i.e., \( p_i \cdot x \neq 0 \) for all rows \( p_i \) of \( P \).

3. **Dense Sets Argument**: 
   - The set of vectors with no zero entries (complement of coordinate hyperplanes) is open and dense in \( \mathbb{R}^n \).
   - The set of vectors \( x \) such that \( Px \) has no zero entries (complement of hyperplanes orthogonal to rows of \( P \)) is also open and dense.

4. **Intersection of Dense Sets**: By the Baire Category Theorem, the intersection of two open dense sets in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) is non-empty. Therefore, there exists a vector \( x \) that lies in both sets, meaning \( x \) has no zero entries and \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

5. **Conclusion**: The existence of such a vector \( x \) is guaranteed by the density and openness arguments, confirming that the required vector exists for any orthogonal matrix \( P \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem: Given an orthogonal matrix P in R^{n x n}, does there exist a vector x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries? Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall what an orthogonal matrix is. An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix whose columns and rows are orthonormal vectors. That means P^T P = I, where P^T is the transpose of P and I is the identity matrix. So, the inverse of P is just its transpose. Orthogonal matrices preserve the dot product, so they preserve angles and lengths. That means transformations like rotations and reflections are orthogonal.

Now, the question is about whether there&#x27;s a vector x with all non-zero entries such that when we multiply it by P, the resulting vector also has all non-zero entries. So, both x and Px must have no zeros in any of their components. 

Let me rephrase the problem: We need to find a vector x in R^n with all entries non-zero such that none of the entries of Px are zero. Alternatively, for each row of P, the dot product with x is non-zero. So, for each row vector p_i of P, p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0. So, the problem reduces to finding an x with all entries non-zero that is not orthogonal to any of the rows of P.

Since P is orthogonal, its rows form an orthonormal basis for R^n. So, the rows are unit vectors and mutually orthogonal. But we need a vector x that is not orthogonal to any of these rows. So, x cannot be orthogonal to any row of P.

But is such an x guaranteed to exist? Hmm. Let me think. In R^n, given a finite set of vectors (in this case, n orthonormal vectors), does there exist a vector that is not orthogonal to any of them?

Alternatively, the question is: Can we find a vector x such that for each i from 1 to n, the inner product of x with the i-th row of P is not zero. Since the rows are orthonormal, they form a basis. So, x can be expressed in terms of this basis. But x is in R^n, so any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the rows. Wait, but the rows themselves are orthonormal, so if we express x as a combination of the rows, then the coefficients would just be the inner products of x with each row. But if we require that all those coefficients are non-zero, then x must have a non-zero component in each row direction. So, in other words, if we write x = c_1 p_1 + c_2 p_2 + ... + c_n p_n, where p_i are the rows of P, then all c_i must be non-zero. But since the rows of P form a basis, any x can be written this way, and we can choose the coefficients c_i to be non-zero. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, but hold on. If we set x to be the sum of all the rows with coefficients 1, then x = p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n, and then Px would be... Wait, no, P is the matrix whose rows are p_i, so multiplying P by x would give us a vector where each component is p_i ⋅ x. But if x is the sum of all p_j, then p_i ⋅ x = p_i ⋅ (p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n) = p_i ⋅ p_i + sum_{j ≠ i} p_i ⋅ p_j. Since the rows are orthonormal, p_i ⋅ p_j = δ_{ij}, so this simplifies to 1 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1. So, Px would be a vector of all ones. Therefore, in that case, x = p_1 + ... + p_n would have Px = (1,1,...,1)^T, which has no zero entries. But wait, does x itself have non-zero entries? Not necessarily. If the sum of the rows of P results in a vector with all non-zero entries, then we&#x27;re done. But maybe in some cases, the sum of the rows could have a zero entry. For example, if P is a permutation matrix, say swapping two coordinates, then the sum of the rows would be (1,1), which in higher dimensions might still have all entries non-zero? Wait, no, a permutation matrix in higher dimensions just permutes the entries. So, if you sum all the rows of a permutation matrix, you would get a vector of all ones, right? Because each row has a single 1 and the rest zeros, and summing all rows would give a vector with n ones. So, in that case, x would be the vector of all ones, which has no zero entries, and Px would also be the vector of all ones, since permutation matrices just permute the entries. Wait, no. If x is all ones, then Px would permute the entries of x, which are all ones, so Px would still be all ones. So, in that case, both x and Px have all entries non-zero.

But wait, this seems too specific. What if P is a different orthogonal matrix? For example, suppose P is a rotation matrix in 2D. Let&#x27;s take n=2. Then, a rotation matrix is orthogonal. Suppose we have a rotation by some angle θ. Then, is there a vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries?

Well, let&#x27;s take x = (1,1). Then, Px would be (cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ). Are there θ such that either component is zero? For example, if θ = 45 degrees, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. Then, Px would be (0, √2). So, the first component is zero. Oh, so in this case, x = (1,1) would result in Px having a zero entry. But does there exist another x with no zero entries such that Px also has none?

Suppose we take x = (a, b) with a, b ≠ 0. Then, Px = (a cosθ - b sinθ, a sinθ + b cosθ). For this to have no zeros, we need a cosθ - b sinθ ≠ 0 and a sinθ + b cosθ ≠ 0.

So, can we choose a and b such that these are satisfied? Let&#x27;s see. If θ is 45 degrees, as above, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. So, the first component becomes (a - b)√2/2 and the second component becomes (a + b)√2/2. So, to have both components non-zero, we need a ≠ b and a ≠ -b. So, as long as a ≠ b and a ≠ -b, then x = (a, b) would work. For example, take a = 1, b = 2. Then, both components are non-zero. So, even though x = (1,1) leads to a zero in the first component, another x with non-zero entries can work.

Therefore, in 2D, even if the rotation matrix can map some non-zero vectors to ones with zeros, there still exist vectors with no zero entries that are mapped to vectors with no zero entries. So, maybe in general, such vectors exist?

Alternatively, maybe we can use a density argument. The set of vectors with no zero entries is dense in R^n. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also dense, since it&#x27;s the complement of the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P. Since the union of hyperplanes has measure zero, their complement is dense. Therefore, the intersection of these two sets (vectors with no zero entries such that Px also has none) is also dense, hence non-empty.

Wait, that might be a more abstract way to see it. Let me elaborate. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the coordinate hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. Each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is a closed set with empty interior. Similarly, the set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}, where p_i are the rows of P. Again, each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is closed with empty interior. Therefore, both complements are open and dense in R^n. The intersection of two open dense sets is also open and dense, hence non-empty. Therefore, there must exist vectors x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, since the rows of P form an orthonormal basis, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are n distinct hyperplanes. The set of vectors not lying in any of these hyperplanes is the complement of their union, which is dense. Similarly, the set of vectors with no zero entries is the complement of the union of coordinate hyperplanes, also dense. The intersection of these two dense sets is non-empty by the Baire Category Theorem, which states that in a complete metric space (like R^n), the intersection of countably many dense open sets is dense. Since we&#x27;re dealing with finite unions of hyperplanes, the complements are open and dense, so their intersection is dense, hence non-empty.

Therefore, such a vector x must exist. Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector exists.

Wait, but let me test this with a specific example. Suppose P is the identity matrix. Then, the rows are the standard basis vectors. So, the hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. The set of vectors with no zero entries is exactly the complement of the union of these hyperplanes. So, in this case, the vectors x with no zero entries are exactly those for which Px (which is x itself) has no zero entries. So, in this case, the two conditions are the same, so the intersection is the same set, which is non-empty. So, works here.

Another example: Let P be a permutation matrix. Then, as before, x with all non-zero entries will be permuted, so Px will have the same entries as x but in different order. Therefore, Px will also have no zero entries. Therefore, in this case, any x with no zero entries works. So, definitely exists.

Another example: Take P to be a rotation matrix in 3D. Suppose we rotate around some axis. Then, similar to the 2D case, can we find a vector x with all non-zero entries such that Px also has all non-zero entries? Let&#x27;s see. Let’s take x = (1,1,1). If we rotate x by some angle, the result might not have any zero entries, depending on the rotation. But even if it does, we can perturb x slightly to avoid zeros. For example, if rotating x = (1,1,1) by 90 degrees around the z-axis gives ( -1, 1, 1), which still has no zeros. Wait, but a 90 degree rotation around z-axis would send (x, y, z) to (-y, x, z). So, x = (1,1,1) becomes (-1, 1, 1), which indeed has no zeros. So in this case, it works. But maybe another rotation could cause a zero? Suppose we have a rotation that aligns a vector with an axis. Wait, but if we rotate a vector with all non-zero entries, would it ever result in a zero? For example, rotating (1,1,1) around some axis by some angle. If the rotation is such that one component becomes zero, then that would require that vector to be orthogonal to one of the coordinate axes, but (1,1,1) is not orthogonal to any coordinate axis unless we have specific rotations. Wait, but actually, any rotation is an orthogonal transformation, but to get a zero component, you would need the rotated vector to lie on a coordinate hyperplane. However, if the original vector is not on any rotated hyperplane corresponding to the coordinate axes, then the rotated vector won&#x27;t have zeros. But perhaps this is too vague.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider specific angles. Suppose we rotate (1,1,1) by 45 degrees around some axis. Depending on the axis, this might or might not introduce zeros. But maybe choosing an axis that isn&#x27;t aligned with the coordinate axes. For example, rotating around the vector (1,1,1) itself by some angle. Then, the vector (1,1,1) would remain unchanged, so no zeros. If we rotate around another axis, say (1,0,0), by 45 degrees. Then, the rotation in the y-z plane. The x-component remains 1, and y and z components become (y cosθ - z sinθ, y sinθ + z cosθ). So, with θ = 45 degrees, y and z components become ( (y - z)/√2, (y + z)/√2 ). If original x is (1,1,1), then after rotation, it becomes (1, (1 - 1)/√2 = 0, (1 + 1)/√2 = √2 ). So, the y-component becomes zero. Oh, so in this case, rotating (1,1,1) around the x-axis by 45 degrees results in a vector with a zero entry. But then, does that mean that for this particular rotation matrix, the vector x = (1,1,1) leads to Px having a zero? But the question is whether there exists some x with no zero entries such that Px also has none. In this case, even though (1,1,1) doesn&#x27;t work, maybe another vector does. For example, take x = (1, 2, 1). Then, rotating around x-axis by 45 degrees gives (1, (2 - 1)/√2, (2 + 1)/√2 ) = (1, 1/√2, 3/√2 ), which has no zeros. So, yes, such a vector exists. So even if some vectors lead to zeros after transformation, others don&#x27;t.

This seems to support the idea that regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, we can always find such a vector x. The key idea is that the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P and the coordinate hyperplanes have measure zero, so their complements intersect.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the set S of vectors x with no zero entries. This is an open set in R^n (since it&#x27;s the complement of the closed set where at least one coordinate is zero). Similarly, the set T of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open, as it&#x27;s the complement of the union of hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}. Since P is orthogonal, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are distinct from the coordinate hyperplanes if P is not a permutation matrix. But even if they overlap, the important thing is that both S and T are open and dense. The intersection of two open dense sets is non-empty in R^n, as R^n is a Baire space. Therefore, S ∩ T ≠ ∅, meaning there exists a vector x in both S and T, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of linear algebra, suppose we want to find x such that x_i ≠ 0 for all i, and (Px)_j ≠ 0 for all j. Let me try to construct such an x. Since P is invertible (orthogonal matrices are invertible), the mapping x ↦ Px is a bijection. Therefore, the image of the set S (vectors with no zero entries) under P is the same as the set T. Since S is open and dense, and P is a homeomorphism (continuous bijection with continuous inverse), then T = P(S) is also open and dense. Therefore, T ∩ S is the intersection of two open dense sets, which must be non-empty. Therefore, there exists x in S such that Px is also in S, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, this seems like a solid argument. Since S is open and dense, and T = P(S) is also open and dense, their intersection is non-empty. Therefore, yes, such an x exists.

But let me check if this reasoning holds. If S is the set of vectors with no zero entries, and T is the set of vectors y such that y = Px has no zero entries, which is equivalent to x = P^T y having no zero entries? Wait, no. T is the set of x such that Px has no zero entries. So, T = {x | Px ∈ S}. Since P is invertible, T = P^{-1}(S). Since S is open and dense, and P^{-1} is a homeomorphism, T is also open and dense. Therefore, S and T are both open and dense, so their intersection is non-empty.

Therefore, there exists x ∈ S ∩ T, which means x has no zero entries, and Px also has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector x exists.

But let me see if I can construct such a vector explicitly. Suppose we take a vector x with all entries equal to 1. Then, Px is the sum of the columns of P. Wait, no, if x is all ones, then Px is the sum of the columns of P scaled by 1. But the columns of P are orthonormal. The sum of the columns of P would be a vector whose norm squared is n, since each column is a unit vector and they are orthogonal. So, the sum would have norm sqrt(n). But does the sum have any zero entries? Not necessarily. For example, if P is the identity matrix, then the sum is (1,1,...,1), which has no zeros. If P is a permutation matrix, the sum is also (1,1,...,1). If P is a rotation matrix, the sum could be different. For instance, in 2D, if P is a rotation by θ, then the sum of the columns would be [cosθ + (-sinθ), sinθ + cosθ], which is [cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ]. For θ = 45 degrees, this becomes [0, √2], which has a zero. So, in that case, x being all ones would result in Px having a zero. But as we saw before, if we take x = (1, 2), then Px might not have any zeros. So, the all-ones vector might not work, but another vector might.

Alternatively, maybe a vector with all entries positive. Since if all entries are positive, then Px is a linear combination of the columns of P with positive coefficients. But the columns of P are orthonormal, so they form a basis. If all coefficients are positive, can such a combination result in a zero entry? Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a vector x with all positive entries such that Px has a zero entry. Then, the zero entry corresponds to a row of P (since Px is computed by row-wise dot products). So, there exists a row p_i of P such that p_i ⋅ x = 0. But x has all positive entries, and p_i is a unit vector. However, the dot product being zero would mean that p_i is orthogonal to x. But since x is in the positive orthant, and p_i is a unit vector, is it possible for p_i to be orthogonal to x?

Yes, it&#x27;s possible. For example, take p_i = (1, -1, 0, ..., 0)/sqrt(2). Then, the dot product with x = (1,1,1,...,1) would be (1 - 1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + ... + 0 = 0. So, even with x having all positive entries, p_i ⋅ x can be zero. Therefore, just having positive entries is not sufficient. But the question is whether there exists some x with all non-zero entries (not necessarily all positive) such that p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0 for all i.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the function f(x) = (Px)_1 * (Px)_2 * ... * (Px)_n * x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_n. We need to find x such that f(x) ≠ 0. Since f is the product of all entries of Px and all entries of x, it&#x27;s a polynomial in the entries of x. The set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the hyperplanes {x_i = 0} and {p_i ⋅ x = 0} for each i. Since we are in R^n, and the zero set of a non-zero polynomial has measure zero, but f is the product of 2n linear terms, which is a non-zero polynomial. Wait, but actually, f(x) is the product of n terms from Px and n terms from x, so total degree 2n. However, the set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the 2n hyperplanes. But since these hyperplanes are all of codimension 1, their union is a closed set with empty interior. Therefore, the complement, where f(x) ≠ 0, is open and dense. Therefore, there exist vectors x where f(x) ≠ 0, which means all entries of x and all entries of Px are non-zero. Hence, such vectors exist.

This again confirms that the answer is yes.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for each row p_i of P, the hyperplane p_i ⋅ x = 0 does not contain any of the coordinate hyperplanes x_j = 0, unless p_i is aligned with some coordinate axis. But since P is orthogonal, if any row p_i were aligned with a coordinate axis, then the corresponding column would also be that axis vector, making P a permutation matrix (possibly with sign changes). But even if P is a permutation matrix with sign changes (i.e., generalized permutation matrix), then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 correspond to x_j = 0 for some j, depending on the permutation and sign. However, in such a case, avoiding those hyperplanes would correspond to avoiding certain coordinate hyperplanes. But if P is a generalized permutation matrix, then Px is just a permutation of x with possible sign changes. Therefore, if we choose x with all entries non-zero, then Px will also have all entries non-zero, since permutation and sign changes don&#x27;t introduce zeros. Therefore, in that case, any x with no zero entries works. 

If P is not a generalized permutation matrix, then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 are not coordinate hyperplanes, so the union of these hyperplanes and the coordinate hyperplanes is a union of 2n distinct hyperplanes (assuming no overlap). However, even if there is overlap, the key point is that the union is a closed set with empty interior, so the complement is open and dense. Therefore, regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, the existence of such an x is guaranteed.

To summarize:

Given an orthogonal matrix \( P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \), we need to determine whether there exists a vector \( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \) with no zero entries such that \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

1. **Orthogonal Matrix Properties**: An orthogonal matrix \( P \) has orthonormal rows and columns, meaning \( P^T P = I \). This implies that the rows of \( P \) form an orthonormal basis for \( \mathbb{R}^n \).

2. **Hyperplanes Consideration**: We need a vector \( x \) such that both \( x \) and \( Px \) have no zero entries. This translates to finding \( x \) such that \( x \) is not orthogonal to any row of \( P \), i.e., \( p_i \cdot x \neq 0 \) for all rows \( p_i \) of \( P \).

3. **Dense Sets Argument**: 
   - The set of vectors with no zero entries (complement of coordinate hyperplanes) is open and dense in \( \mathbb{R}^n \).
   - The set of vectors \( x \) such that \( Px \) has no zero entries (complement of hyperplanes orthogonal to rows of \( P \)) is also open and dense.

4. **Intersection of Dense Sets**: By the Baire Category Theorem, the intersection of two open dense sets in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) is non-empty. Therefore, there exists a vector \( x \) that lies in both sets, meaning \( x \) has no zero entries and \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

5. **Conclusion**: The existence of such a vector \( x \) is guaranteed by the density and openness arguments, confirming that the required vector exists for any orthogonal matrix \( P \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem: Given an orthogonal matrix P in R^{n x n}, does there exist a vector x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries? Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall what an orthogonal matrix is. An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix whose columns and rows are orthonormal vectors. That means P^T P = I, where P^T is the transpose of P and I is the identity matrix. So, the inverse of P is just its transpose. Orthogonal matrices preserve the dot product, so they preserve angles and lengths. That means transformations like rotations and reflections are orthogonal.

Now, the question is about whether there&#x27;s a vector x with all non-zero entries such that when we multiply it by P, the resulting vector also has all non-zero entries. So, both x and Px must have no zeros in any of their components. 

Let me rephrase the problem: We need to find a vector x in R^n with all entries non-zero such that none of the entries of Px are zero. Alternatively, for each row of P, the dot product with x is non-zero. So, for each row vector p_i of P, p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0. So, the problem reduces to finding an x with all entries non-zero that is not orthogonal to any of the rows of P.

Since P is orthogonal, its rows form an orthonormal basis for R^n. So, the rows are unit vectors and mutually orthogonal. But we need a vector x that is not orthogonal to any of these rows. So, x cannot be orthogonal to any row of P.

But is such an x guaranteed to exist? Hmm. Let me think. In R^n, given a finite set of vectors (in this case, n orthonormal vectors), does there exist a vector that is not orthogonal to any of them?

Alternatively, the question is: Can we find a vector x such that for each i from 1 to n, the inner product of x with the i-th row of P is not zero. Since the rows are orthonormal, they form a basis. So, x can be expressed in terms of this basis. But x is in R^n, so any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the rows. Wait, but the rows themselves are orthonormal, so if we express x as a combination of the rows, then the coefficients would just be the inner products of x with each row. But if we require that all those coefficients are non-zero, then x must have a non-zero component in each row direction. So, in other words, if we write x = c_1 p_1 + c_2 p_2 + ... + c_n p_n, where p_i are the rows of P, then all c_i must be non-zero. But since the rows of P form a basis, any x can be written this way, and we can choose the coefficients c_i to be non-zero. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, but hold on. If we set x to be the sum of all the rows with coefficients 1, then x = p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n, and then Px would be... Wait, no, P is the matrix whose rows are p_i, so multiplying P by x would give us a vector where each component is p_i ⋅ x. But if x is the sum of all p_j, then p_i ⋅ x = p_i ⋅ (p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n) = p_i ⋅ p_i + sum_{j ≠ i} p_i ⋅ p_j. Since the rows are orthonormal, p_i ⋅ p_j = δ_{ij}, so this simplifies to 1 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1. So, Px would be a vector of all ones. Therefore, in that case, x = p_1 + ... + p_n would have Px = (1,1,...,1)^T, which has no zero entries. But wait, does x itself have non-zero entries? Not necessarily. If the sum of the rows of P results in a vector with all non-zero entries, then we&#x27;re done. But maybe in some cases, the sum of the rows could have a zero entry. For example, if P is a permutation matrix, say swapping two coordinates, then the sum of the rows would be (1,1), which in higher dimensions might still have all entries non-zero? Wait, no, a permutation matrix in higher dimensions just permutes the entries. So, if you sum all the rows of a permutation matrix, you would get a vector of all ones, right? Because each row has a single 1 and the rest zeros, and summing all rows would give a vector with n ones. So, in that case, x would be the vector of all ones, which has no zero entries, and Px would also be the vector of all ones, since permutation matrices just permute the entries. Wait, no. If x is all ones, then Px would permute the entries of x, which are all ones, so Px would still be all ones. So, in that case, both x and Px have all entries non-zero.

But wait, this seems too specific. What if P is a different orthogonal matrix? For example, suppose P is a rotation matrix in 2D. Let&#x27;s take n=2. Then, a rotation matrix is orthogonal. Suppose we have a rotation by some angle θ. Then, is there a vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries?

Well, let&#x27;s take x = (1,1). Then, Px would be (cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ). Are there θ such that either component is zero? For example, if θ = 45 degrees, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. Then, Px would be (0, √2). So, the first component is zero. Oh, so in this case, x = (1,1) would result in Px having a zero entry. But does there exist another x with no zero entries such that Px also has none?

Suppose we take x = (a, b) with a, b ≠ 0. Then, Px = (a cosθ - b sinθ, a sinθ + b cosθ). For this to have no zeros, we need a cosθ - b sinθ ≠ 0 and a sinθ + b cosθ ≠ 0.

So, can we choose a and b such that these are satisfied? Let&#x27;s see. If θ is 45 degrees, as above, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. So, the first component becomes (a - b)√2/2 and the second component becomes (a + b)√2/2. So, to have both components non-zero, we need a ≠ b and a ≠ -b. So, as long as a ≠ b and a ≠ -b, then x = (a, b) would work. For example, take a = 1, b = 2. Then, both components are non-zero. So, even though x = (1,1) leads to a zero in the first component, another x with non-zero entries can work.

Therefore, in 2D, even if the rotation matrix can map some non-zero vectors to ones with zeros, there still exist vectors with no zero entries that are mapped to vectors with no zero entries. So, maybe in general, such vectors exist?

Alternatively, maybe we can use a density argument. The set of vectors with no zero entries is dense in R^n. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also dense, since it&#x27;s the complement of the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P. Since the union of hyperplanes has measure zero, their complement is dense. Therefore, the intersection of these two sets (vectors with no zero entries such that Px also has none) is also dense, hence non-empty.

Wait, that might be a more abstract way to see it. Let me elaborate. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the coordinate hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. Each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is a closed set with empty interior. Similarly, the set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}, where p_i are the rows of P. Again, each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is closed with empty interior. Therefore, both complements are open and dense in R^n. The intersection of two open dense sets is also open and dense, hence non-empty. Therefore, there must exist vectors x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, since the rows of P form an orthonormal basis, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are n distinct hyperplanes. The set of vectors not lying in any of these hyperplanes is the complement of their union, which is dense. Similarly, the set of vectors with no zero entries is the complement of the union of coordinate hyperplanes, also dense. The intersection of these two dense sets is non-empty by the Baire Category Theorem, which states that in a complete metric space (like R^n), the intersection of countably many dense open sets is dense. Since we&#x27;re dealing with finite unions of hyperplanes, the complements are open and dense, so their intersection is dense, hence non-empty.

Therefore, such a vector x must exist. Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector exists.

Wait, but let me test this with a specific example. Suppose P is the identity matrix. Then, the rows are the standard basis vectors. So, the hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. The set of vectors with no zero entries is exactly the complement of the union of these hyperplanes. So, in this case, the vectors x with no zero entries are exactly those for which Px (which is x itself) has no zero entries. So, in this case, the two conditions are the same, so the intersection is the same set, which is non-empty. So, works here.

Another example: Let P be a permutation matrix. Then, as before, x with all non-zero entries will be permuted, so Px will have the same entries as x but in different order. Therefore, Px will also have no zero entries. Therefore, in this case, any x with no zero entries works. So, definitely exists.

Another example: Take P to be a rotation matrix in 3D. Suppose we rotate around some axis. Then, similar to the 2D case, can we find a vector x with all non-zero entries such that Px also has all non-zero entries? Let&#x27;s see. Let’s take x = (1,1,1). If we rotate x by some angle, the result might not have any zero entries, depending on the rotation. But even if it does, we can perturb x slightly to avoid zeros. For example, if rotating x = (1,1,1) by 90 degrees around the z-axis gives ( -1, 1, 1), which still has no zeros. Wait, but a 90 degree rotation around z-axis would send (x, y, z) to (-y, x, z). So, x = (1,1,1) becomes (-1, 1, 1), which indeed has no zeros. So in this case, it works. But maybe another rotation could cause a zero? Suppose we have a rotation that aligns a vector with an axis. Wait, but if we rotate a vector with all non-zero entries, would it ever result in a zero? For example, rotating (1,1,1) around some axis by some angle. If the rotation is such that one component becomes zero, then that would require that vector to be orthogonal to one of the coordinate axes, but (1,1,1) is not orthogonal to any coordinate axis unless we have specific rotations. Wait, but actually, any rotation is an orthogonal transformation, but to get a zero component, you would need the rotated vector to lie on a coordinate hyperplane. However, if the original vector is not on any rotated hyperplane corresponding to the coordinate axes, then the rotated vector won&#x27;t have zeros. But perhaps this is too vague.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider specific angles. Suppose we rotate (1,1,1) by 45 degrees around some axis. Depending on the axis, this might or might not introduce zeros. But maybe choosing an axis that isn&#x27;t aligned with the coordinate axes. For example, rotating around the vector (1,1,1) itself by some angle. Then, the vector (1,1,1) would remain unchanged, so no zeros. If we rotate around another axis, say (1,0,0), by 45 degrees. Then, the rotation in the y-z plane. The x-component remains 1, and y and z components become (y cosθ - z sinθ, y sinθ + z cosθ). So, with θ = 45 degrees, y and z components become ( (y - z)/√2, (y + z)/√2 ). If original x is (1,1,1), then after rotation, it becomes (1, (1 - 1)/√2 = 0, (1 + 1)/√2 = √2 ). So, the y-component becomes zero. Oh, so in this case, rotating (1,1,1) around the x-axis by 45 degrees results in a vector with a zero entry. But then, does that mean that for this particular rotation matrix, the vector x = (1,1,1) leads to Px having a zero? But the question is whether there exists some x with no zero entries such that Px also has none. In this case, even though (1,1,1) doesn&#x27;t work, maybe another vector does. For example, take x = (1, 2, 1). Then, rotating around x-axis by 45 degrees gives (1, (2 - 1)/√2, (2 + 1)/√2 ) = (1, 1/√2, 3/√2 ), which has no zeros. So, yes, such a vector exists. So even if some vectors lead to zeros after transformation, others don&#x27;t.

This seems to support the idea that regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, we can always find such a vector x. The key idea is that the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P and the coordinate hyperplanes have measure zero, so their complements intersect.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the set S of vectors x with no zero entries. This is an open set in R^n (since it&#x27;s the complement of the closed set where at least one coordinate is zero). Similarly, the set T of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open, as it&#x27;s the complement of the union of hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}. Since P is orthogonal, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are distinct from the coordinate hyperplanes if P is not a permutation matrix. But even if they overlap, the important thing is that both S and T are open and dense. The intersection of two open dense sets is non-empty in R^n, as R^n is a Baire space. Therefore, S ∩ T ≠ ∅, meaning there exists a vector x in both S and T, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of linear algebra, suppose we want to find x such that x_i ≠ 0 for all i, and (Px)_j ≠ 0 for all j. Let me try to construct such an x. Since P is invertible (orthogonal matrices are invertible), the mapping x ↦ Px is a bijection. Therefore, the image of the set S (vectors with no zero entries) under P is the same as the set T. Since S is open and dense, and P is a homeomorphism (continuous bijection with continuous inverse), then T = P(S) is also open and dense. Therefore, T ∩ S is the intersection of two open dense sets, which must be non-empty. Therefore, there exists x in S such that Px is also in S, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, this seems like a solid argument. Since S is open and dense, and T = P(S) is also open and dense, their intersection is non-empty. Therefore, yes, such an x exists.

But let me check if this reasoning holds. If S is the set of vectors with no zero entries, and T is the set of vectors y such that y = Px has no zero entries, which is equivalent to x = P^T y having no zero entries? Wait, no. T is the set of x such that Px has no zero entries. So, T = {x | Px ∈ S}. Since P is invertible, T = P^{-1}(S). Since S is open and dense, and P^{-1} is a homeomorphism, T is also open and dense. Therefore, S and T are both open and dense, so their intersection is non-empty.

Therefore, there exists x ∈ S ∩ T, which means x has no zero entries, and Px also has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector x exists.

But let me see if I can construct such a vector explicitly. Suppose we take a vector x with all entries equal to 1. Then, Px is the sum of the columns of P. Wait, no, if x is all ones, then Px is the sum of the columns of P scaled by 1. But the columns of P are orthonormal. The sum of the columns of P would be a vector whose norm squared is n, since each column is a unit vector and they are orthogonal. So, the sum would have norm sqrt(n). But does the sum have any zero entries? Not necessarily. For example, if P is the identity matrix, then the sum is (1,1,...,1), which has no zeros. If P is a permutation matrix, the sum is also (1,1,...,1). If P is a rotation matrix, the sum could be different. For instance, in 2D, if P is a rotation by θ, then the sum of the columns would be [cosθ + (-sinθ), sinθ + cosθ], which is [cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ]. For θ = 45 degrees, this becomes [0, √2], which has a zero. So, in that case, x being all ones would result in Px having a zero. But as we saw before, if we take x = (1, 2), then Px might not have any zeros. So, the all-ones vector might not work, but another vector might.

Alternatively, maybe a vector with all entries positive. Since if all entries are positive, then Px is a linear combination of the columns of P with positive coefficients. But the columns of P are orthonormal, so they form a basis. If all coefficients are positive, can such a combination result in a zero entry? Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a vector x with all positive entries such that Px has a zero entry. Then, the zero entry corresponds to a row of P (since Px is computed by row-wise dot products). So, there exists a row p_i of P such that p_i ⋅ x = 0. But x has all positive entries, and p_i is a unit vector. However, the dot product being zero would mean that p_i is orthogonal to x. But since x is in the positive orthant, and p_i is a unit vector, is it possible for p_i to be orthogonal to x?

Yes, it&#x27;s possible. For example, take p_i = (1, -1, 0, ..., 0)/sqrt(2). Then, the dot product with x = (1,1,1,...,1) would be (1 - 1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + ... + 0 = 0. So, even with x having all positive entries, p_i ⋅ x can be zero. Therefore, just having positive entries is not sufficient. But the question is whether there exists some x with all non-zero entries (not necessarily all positive) such that p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0 for all i.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the function f(x) = (Px)_1 * (Px)_2 * ... * (Px)_n * x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_n. We need to find x such that f(x) ≠ 0. Since f is the product of all entries of Px and all entries of x, it&#x27;s a polynomial in the entries of x. The set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the hyperplanes {x_i = 0} and {p_i ⋅ x = 0} for each i. Since we are in R^n, and the zero set of a non-zero polynomial has measure zero, but f is the product of 2n linear terms, which is a non-zero polynomial. Wait, but actually, f(x) is the product of n terms from Px and n terms from x, so total degree 2n. However, the set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the 2n hyperplanes. But since these hyperplanes are all of codimension 1, their union is a closed set with empty interior. Therefore, the complement, where f(x) ≠ 0, is open and dense. Therefore, there exist vectors x where f(x) ≠ 0, which means all entries of x and all entries of Px are non-zero. Hence, such vectors exist.

This again confirms that the answer is yes.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for each row p_i of P, the hyperplane p_i ⋅ x = 0 does not contain any of the coordinate hyperplanes x_j = 0, unless p_i is aligned with some coordinate axis. But since P is orthogonal, if any row p_i were aligned with a coordinate axis, then the corresponding column would also be that axis vector, making P a permutation matrix (possibly with sign changes). But even if P is a permutation matrix with sign changes (i.e., generalized permutation matrix), then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 correspond to x_j = 0 for some j, depending on the permutation and sign. However, in such a case, avoiding those hyperplanes would correspond to avoiding certain coordinate hyperplanes. But if P is a generalized permutation matrix, then Px is just a permutation of x with possible sign changes. Therefore, if we choose x with all entries non-zero, then Px will also have all entries non-zero, since permutation and sign changes don&#x27;t introduce zeros. Therefore, in that case, any x with no zero entries works. 

If P is not a generalized permutation matrix, then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 are not coordinate hyperplanes, so the union of these hyperplanes and the coordinate hyperplanes is a union of 2n distinct hyperplanes (assuming no overlap). However, even if there is overlap, the key point is that the union is a closed set with empty interior, so the complement is open and dense. Therefore, regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, the existence of such an x is guaranteed.

To summarize:

1. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is open and dense.
2. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open and dense.
3. The intersection of these two sets is non-empty due to the Baire Category Theorem.
4. Therefore, there must exist at least one vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Therefore, the answer is yes, such a vector x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem: Given an orthogonal matrix P in R^{n x n}, does there exist a vector x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries? Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall what an orthogonal matrix is. An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix whose columns and rows are orthonormal vectors. That means P^T P = I, where P^T is the transpose of P and I is the identity matrix. So, the inverse of P is just its transpose. Orthogonal matrices preserve the dot product, so they preserve angles and lengths. That means transformations like rotations and reflections are orthogonal.

Now, the question is about whether there&#x27;s a vector x with all non-zero entries such that when we multiply it by P, the resulting vector also has all non-zero entries. So, both x and Px must have no zeros in any of their components. 

Let me rephrase the problem: We need to find a vector x in R^n with all entries non-zero such that none of the entries of Px are zero. Alternatively, for each row of P, the dot product with x is non-zero. So, for each row vector p_i of P, p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0. So, the problem reduces to finding an x with all entries non-zero that is not orthogonal to any of the rows of P.

Since P is orthogonal, its rows form an orthonormal basis for R^n. So, the rows are unit vectors and mutually orthogonal. But we need a vector x that is not orthogonal to any of these rows. So, x cannot be orthogonal to any row of P.

But is such an x guaranteed to exist? Hmm. Let me think. In R^n, given a finite set of vectors (in this case, n orthonormal vectors), does there exist a vector that is not orthogonal to any of them?

Alternatively, the question is: Can we find a vector x such that for each i from 1 to n, the inner product of x with the i-th row of P is not zero. Since the rows are orthonormal, they form a basis. So, x can be expressed in terms of this basis. But x is in R^n, so any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the rows. Wait, but the rows themselves are orthonormal, so if we express x as a combination of the rows, then the coefficients would just be the inner products of x with each row. But if we require that all those coefficients are non-zero, then x must have a non-zero component in each row direction. So, in other words, if we write x = c_1 p_1 + c_2 p_2 + ... + c_n p_n, where p_i are the rows of P, then all c_i must be non-zero. But since the rows of P form a basis, any x can be written this way, and we can choose the coefficients c_i to be non-zero. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, but hold on. If we set x to be the sum of all the rows with coefficients 1, then x = p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n, and then Px would be... Wait, no, P is the matrix whose rows are p_i, so multiplying P by x would give us a vector where each component is p_i ⋅ x. But if x is the sum of all p_j, then p_i ⋅ x = p_i ⋅ (p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n) = p_i ⋅ p_i + sum_{j ≠ i} p_i ⋅ p_j. Since the rows are orthonormal, p_i ⋅ p_j = δ_{ij}, so this simplifies to 1 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1. So, Px would be a vector of all ones. Therefore, in that case, x = p_1 + ... + p_n would have Px = (1,1,...,1)^T, which has no zero entries. But wait, does x itself have non-zero entries? Not necessarily. If the sum of the rows of P results in a vector with all non-zero entries, then we&#x27;re done. But maybe in some cases, the sum of the rows could have a zero entry. For example, if P is a permutation matrix, say swapping two coordinates, then the sum of the rows would be (1,1), which in higher dimensions might still have all entries non-zero? Wait, no, a permutation matrix in higher dimensions just permutes the entries. So, if you sum all the rows of a permutation matrix, you would get a vector of all ones, right? Because each row has a single 1 and the rest zeros, and summing all rows would give a vector with n ones. So, in that case, x would be the vector of all ones, which has no zero entries, and Px would also be the vector of all ones, since permutation matrices just permute the entries. Wait, no. If x is all ones, then Px would permute the entries of x, which are all ones, so Px would still be all ones. So, in that case, both x and Px have all entries non-zero.

But wait, this seems too specific. What if P is a different orthogonal matrix? For example, suppose P is a rotation matrix in 2D. Let&#x27;s take n=2. Then, a rotation matrix is orthogonal. Suppose we have a rotation by some angle θ. Then, is there a vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries?

Well, let&#x27;s take x = (1,1). Then, Px would be (cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ). Are there θ such that either component is zero? For example, if θ = 45 degrees, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. Then, Px would be (0, √2). So, the first component is zero. Oh, so in this case, x = (1,1) would result in Px having a zero entry. But does there exist another x with no zero entries such that Px also has none?

Suppose we take x = (a, b) with a, b ≠ 0. Then, Px = (a cosθ - b sinθ, a sinθ + b cosθ). For this to have no zeros, we need a cosθ - b sinθ ≠ 0 and a sinθ + b cosθ ≠ 0.

So, can we choose a and b such that these are satisfied? Let&#x27;s see. If θ is 45 degrees, as above, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. So, the first component becomes (a - b)√2/2 and the second component becomes (a + b)√2/2. So, to have both components non-zero, we need a ≠ b and a ≠ -b. So, as long as a ≠ b and a ≠ -b, then x = (a, b) would work. For example, take a = 1, b = 2. Then, both components are non-zero. So, even though x = (1,1) leads to a zero in the first component, another x with non-zero entries can work.

Therefore, in 2D, even if the rotation matrix can map some non-zero vectors to ones with zeros, there still exist vectors with no zero entries that are mapped to vectors with no zero entries. So, maybe in general, such vectors exist?

Alternatively, maybe we can use a density argument. The set of vectors with no zero entries is dense in R^n. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also dense, since it&#x27;s the complement of the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P. Since the union of hyperplanes has measure zero, their complement is dense. Therefore, the intersection of these two sets (vectors with no zero entries such that Px also has none) is also dense, hence non-empty.

Wait, that might be a more abstract way to see it. Let me elaborate. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the coordinate hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. Each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is a closed set with empty interior. Similarly, the set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}, where p_i are the rows of P. Again, each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is closed with empty interior. Therefore, both complements are open and dense in R^n. The intersection of two open dense sets is also open and dense, hence non-empty. Therefore, there must exist vectors x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, since the rows of P form an orthonormal basis, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are n distinct hyperplanes. The set of vectors not lying in any of these hyperplanes is the complement of their union, which is dense. Similarly, the set of vectors with no zero entries is the complement of the union of coordinate hyperplanes, also dense. The intersection of these two dense sets is non-empty by the Baire Category Theorem, which states that in a complete metric space (like R^n), the intersection of countably many dense open sets is dense. Since we&#x27;re dealing with finite unions of hyperplanes, the complements are open and dense, so their intersection is dense, hence non-empty.

Therefore, such a vector x must exist. Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector exists.

Wait, but let me test this with a specific example. Suppose P is the identity matrix. Then, the rows are the standard basis vectors. So, the hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. The set of vectors with no zero entries is exactly the complement of the union of these hyperplanes. So, in this case, the vectors x with no zero entries are exactly those for which Px (which is x itself) has no zero entries. So, in this case, the two conditions are the same, so the intersection is the same set, which is non-empty. So, works here.

Another example: Let P be a permutation matrix. Then, as before, x with all non-zero entries will be permuted, so Px will have the same entries as x but in different order. Therefore, Px will also have no zero entries. Therefore, in this case, any x with no zero entries works. So, definitely exists.

Another example: Take P to be a rotation matrix in 3D. Suppose we rotate around some axis. Then, similar to the 2D case, can we find a vector x with all non-zero entries such that Px also has all non-zero entries? Let&#x27;s see. Let’s take x = (1,1,1). If we rotate x by some angle, the result might not have any zero entries, depending on the rotation. But even if it does, we can perturb x slightly to avoid zeros. For example, if rotating x = (1,1,1) by 90 degrees around the z-axis gives ( -1, 1, 1), which still has no zeros. Wait, but a 90 degree rotation around z-axis would send (x, y, z) to (-y, x, z). So, x = (1,1,1) becomes (-1, 1, 1), which indeed has no zeros. So in this case, it works. But maybe another rotation could cause a zero? Suppose we have a rotation that aligns a vector with an axis. Wait, but if we rotate a vector with all non-zero entries, would it ever result in a zero? For example, rotating (1,1,1) around some axis by some angle. If the rotation is such that one component becomes zero, then that would require that vector to be orthogonal to one of the coordinate axes, but (1,1,1) is not orthogonal to any coordinate axis unless we have specific rotations. Wait, but actually, any rotation is an orthogonal transformation, but to get a zero component, you would need the rotated vector to lie on a coordinate hyperplane. However, if the original vector is not on any rotated hyperplane corresponding to the coordinate axes, then the rotated vector won&#x27;t have zeros. But perhaps this is too vague.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider specific angles. Suppose we rotate (1,1,1) by 45 degrees around some axis. Depending on the axis, this might or might not introduce zeros. But maybe choosing an axis that isn&#x27;t aligned with the coordinate axes. For example, rotating around the vector (1,1,1) itself by some angle. Then, the vector (1,1,1) would remain unchanged, so no zeros. If we rotate around another axis, say (1,0,0), by 45 degrees. Then, the rotation in the y-z plane. The x-component remains 1, and y and z components become (y cosθ - z sinθ, y sinθ + z cosθ). So, with θ = 45 degrees, y and z components become ( (y - z)/√2, (y + z)/√2 ). If original x is (1,1,1), then after rotation, it becomes (1, (1 - 1)/√2 = 0, (1 + 1)/√2 = √2 ). So, the y-component becomes zero. Oh, so in this case, rotating (1,1,1) around the x-axis by 45 degrees results in a vector with a zero entry. But then, does that mean that for this particular rotation matrix, the vector x = (1,1,1) leads to Px having a zero? But the question is whether there exists some x with no zero entries such that Px also has none. In this case, even though (1,1,1) doesn&#x27;t work, maybe another vector does. For example, take x = (1, 2, 1). Then, rotating around x-axis by 45 degrees gives (1, (2 - 1)/√2, (2 + 1)/√2 ) = (1, 1/√2, 3/√2 ), which has no zeros. So, yes, such a vector exists. So even if some vectors lead to zeros after transformation, others don&#x27;t.

This seems to support the idea that regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, we can always find such a vector x. The key idea is that the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P and the coordinate hyperplanes have measure zero, so their complements intersect.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the set S of vectors x with no zero entries. This is an open set in R^n (since it&#x27;s the complement of the closed set where at least one coordinate is zero). Similarly, the set T of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open, as it&#x27;s the complement of the union of hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}. Since P is orthogonal, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are distinct from the coordinate hyperplanes if P is not a permutation matrix. But even if they overlap, the important thing is that both S and T are open and dense. The intersection of two open dense sets is non-empty in R^n, as R^n is a Baire space. Therefore, S ∩ T ≠ ∅, meaning there exists a vector x in both S and T, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of linear algebra, suppose we want to find x such that x_i ≠ 0 for all i, and (Px)_j ≠ 0 for all j. Let me try to construct such an x. Since P is invertible (orthogonal matrices are invertible), the mapping x ↦ Px is a bijection. Therefore, the image of the set S (vectors with no zero entries) under P is the same as the set T. Since S is open and dense, and P is a homeomorphism (continuous bijection with continuous inverse), then T = P(S) is also open and dense. Therefore, T ∩ S is the intersection of two open dense sets, which must be non-empty. Therefore, there exists x in S such that Px is also in S, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, this seems like a solid argument. Since S is open and dense, and T = P(S) is also open and dense, their intersection is non-empty. Therefore, yes, such an x exists.

But let me check if this reasoning holds. If S is the set of vectors with no zero entries, and T is the set of vectors y such that y = Px has no zero entries, which is equivalent to x = P^T y having no zero entries? Wait, no. T is the set of x such that Px has no zero entries. So, T = {x | Px ∈ S}. Since P is invertible, T = P^{-1}(S). Since S is open and dense, and P^{-1} is a homeomorphism, T is also open and dense. Therefore, S and T are both open and dense, so their intersection is non-empty.

Therefore, there exists x ∈ S ∩ T, which means x has no zero entries, and Px also has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector x exists.

But let me see if I can construct such a vector explicitly. Suppose we take a vector x with all entries equal to 1. Then, Px is the sum of the columns of P. Wait, no, if x is all ones, then Px is the sum of the columns of P scaled by 1. But the columns of P are orthonormal. The sum of the columns of P would be a vector whose norm squared is n, since each column is a unit vector and they are orthogonal. So, the sum would have norm sqrt(n). But does the sum have any zero entries? Not necessarily. For example, if P is the identity matrix, then the sum is (1,1,...,1), which has no zeros. If P is a permutation matrix, the sum is also (1,1,...,1). If P is a rotation matrix, the sum could be different. For instance, in 2D, if P is a rotation by θ, then the sum of the columns would be [cosθ + (-sinθ), sinθ + cosθ], which is [cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ]. For θ = 45 degrees, this becomes [0, √2], which has a zero. So, in that case, x being all ones would result in Px having a zero. But as we saw before, if we take x = (1, 2), then Px might not have any zeros. So, the all-ones vector might not work, but another vector might.

Alternatively, maybe a vector with all entries positive. Since if all entries are positive, then Px is a linear combination of the columns of P with positive coefficients. But the columns of P are orthonormal, so they form a basis. If all coefficients are positive, can such a combination result in a zero entry? Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a vector x with all positive entries such that Px has a zero entry. Then, the zero entry corresponds to a row of P (since Px is computed by row-wise dot products). So, there exists a row p_i of P such that p_i ⋅ x = 0. But x has all positive entries, and p_i is a unit vector. However, the dot product being zero would mean that p_i is orthogonal to x. But since x is in the positive orthant, and p_i is a unit vector, is it possible for p_i to be orthogonal to x?

Yes, it&#x27;s possible. For example, take p_i = (1, -1, 0, ..., 0)/sqrt(2). Then, the dot product with x = (1,1,1,...,1) would be (1 - 1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + ... + 0 = 0. So, even with x having all positive entries, p_i ⋅ x can be zero. Therefore, just having positive entries is not sufficient. But the question is whether there exists some x with all non-zero entries (not necessarily all positive) such that p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0 for all i.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the function f(x) = (Px)_1 * (Px)_2 * ... * (Px)_n * x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_n. We need to find x such that f(x) ≠ 0. Since f is the product of all entries of Px and all entries of x, it&#x27;s a polynomial in the entries of x. The set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the hyperplanes {x_i = 0} and {p_i ⋅ x = 0} for each i. Since we are in R^n, and the zero set of a non-zero polynomial has measure zero, but f is the product of 2n linear terms, which is a non-zero polynomial. Wait, but actually, f(x) is the product of n terms from Px and n terms from x, so total degree 2n. However, the set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the 2n hyperplanes. But since these hyperplanes are all of codimension 1, their union is a closed set with empty interior. Therefore, the complement, where f(x) ≠ 0, is open and dense. Therefore, there exist vectors x where f(x) ≠ 0, which means all entries of x and all entries of Px are non-zero. Hence, such vectors exist.

This again confirms that the answer is yes.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for each row p_i of P, the hyperplane p_i ⋅ x = 0 does not contain any of the coordinate hyperplanes x_j = 0, unless p_i is aligned with some coordinate axis. But since P is orthogonal, if any row p_i were aligned with a coordinate axis, then the corresponding column would also be that axis vector, making P a permutation matrix (possibly with sign changes). But even if P is a permutation matrix with sign changes (i.e., generalized permutation matrix), then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 correspond to x_j = 0 for some j, depending on the permutation and sign. However, in such a case, avoiding those hyperplanes would correspond to avoiding certain coordinate hyperplanes. But if P is a generalized permutation matrix, then Px is just a permutation of x with possible sign changes. Therefore, if we choose x with all entries non-zero, then Px will also have all entries non-zero, since permutation and sign changes don&#x27;t introduce zeros. Therefore, in that case, any x with no zero entries works. 

If P is not a generalized permutation matrix, then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 are not coordinate hyperplanes, so the union of these hyperplanes and the coordinate hyperplanes is a union of 2n distinct hyperplanes (assuming no overlap). However, even if there is overlap, the key point is that the union is a closed set with empty interior, so the complement is open and dense. Therefore, regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, the existence of such an x is guaranteed.

To summarize:

1. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is open and dense.
2. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open and dense.
3. The intersection of these two sets is non-empty due to the Baire Category Theorem.
4. Therefore, there must exist at least one vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Therefore, the answer is yes, such a vector x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given an orthogonal matrix \( P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \), we need to determine whether there exists a vector \( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \) with no zero entries such that \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

1. **Orthogonal Matrix Properties**: An orthogonal matrix \( P \) has orthonormal rows and columns, meaning \( P^T P = I \). This implies that the rows of \( P \) form an orthonormal basis for \( \mathbb{R}^n \).

2. **Hyperplanes Consideration**: We need a vector \( x \) such that both \( x \) and \( Px \) have no zero entries. This translates to finding \( x \) such that \( x \) is not orthogonal to any row of \( P \), i.e., \( p_i \cdot x \neq 0 \) for all rows \( p_i \) of \( P \).

3. **Dense Sets Argument**: 
   - The set of vectors with no zero entries (complement of coordinate hyperplanes) is open and dense in \( \mathbb{R}^n \).
   - The set of vectors \( x \) such that \( Px \) has no zero entries (complement of hyperplanes orthogonal to rows of \( P \)) is also open and dense.

4. **Intersection of Dense Sets**: By the Baire Category Theorem, the intersection of two open dense sets in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) is non-empty. Therefore, there exists a vector \( x \) that lies in both sets, meaning \( x \) has no zero entries and \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

5. **Conclusion**: The existence of such a vector \( x \) is guaranteed by the density and openness arguments, confirming that the required vector exists for any orthogonal matrix \( P \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem: Given an orthogonal matrix P in R^{n x n}, does there exist a vector x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries? Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall what an orthogonal matrix is. An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix whose columns and rows are orthonormal vectors. That means P^T P = I, where P^T is the transpose of P and I is the identity matrix. So, the inverse of P is just its transpose. Orthogonal matrices preserve the dot product, so they preserve angles and lengths. That means transformations like rotations and reflections are orthogonal.

Now, the question is about whether there&#x27;s a vector x with all non-zero entries such that when we multiply it by P, the resulting vector also has all non-zero entries. So, both x and Px must have no zeros in any of their components. 

Let me rephrase the problem: We need to find a vector x in R^n with all entries non-zero such that none of the entries of Px are zero. Alternatively, for each row of P, the dot product with x is non-zero. So, for each row vector p_i of P, p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0. So, the problem reduces to finding an x with all entries non-zero that is not orthogonal to any of the rows of P.

Since P is orthogonal, its rows form an orthonormal basis for R^n. So, the rows are unit vectors and mutually orthogonal. But we need a vector x that is not orthogonal to any of these rows. So, x cannot be orthogonal to any row of P.

But is such an x guaranteed to exist? Hmm. Let me think. In R^n, given a finite set of vectors (in this case, n orthonormal vectors), does there exist a vector that is not orthogonal to any of them?

Alternatively, the question is: Can we find a vector x such that for each i from 1 to n, the inner product of x with the i-th row of P is not zero. Since the rows are orthonormal, they form a basis. So, x can be expressed in terms of this basis. But x is in R^n, so any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the rows. Wait, but the rows themselves are orthonormal, so if we express x as a combination of the rows, then the coefficients would just be the inner products of x with each row. But if we require that all those coefficients are non-zero, then x must have a non-zero component in each row direction. So, in other words, if we write x = c_1 p_1 + c_2 p_2 + ... + c_n p_n, where p_i are the rows of P, then all c_i must be non-zero. But since the rows of P form a basis, any x can be written this way, and we can choose the coefficients c_i to be non-zero. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, but hold on. If we set x to be the sum of all the rows with coefficients 1, then x = p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n, and then Px would be... Wait, no, P is the matrix whose rows are p_i, so multiplying P by x would give us a vector where each component is p_i ⋅ x. But if x is the sum of all p_j, then p_i ⋅ x = p_i ⋅ (p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n) = p_i ⋅ p_i + sum_{j ≠ i} p_i ⋅ p_j. Since the rows are orthonormal, p_i ⋅ p_j = δ_{ij}, so this simplifies to 1 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1. So, Px would be a vector of all ones. Therefore, in that case, x = p_1 + ... + p_n would have Px = (1,1,...,1)^T, which has no zero entries. But wait, does x itself have non-zero entries? Not necessarily. If the sum of the rows of P results in a vector with all non-zero entries, then we&#x27;re done. But maybe in some cases, the sum of the rows could have a zero entry. For example, if P is a permutation matrix, say swapping two coordinates, then the sum of the rows would be (1,1), which in higher dimensions might still have all entries non-zero? Wait, no, a permutation matrix in higher dimensions just permutes the entries. So, if you sum all the rows of a permutation matrix, you would get a vector of all ones, right? Because each row has a single 1 and the rest zeros, and summing all rows would give a vector with n ones. So, in that case, x would be the vector of all ones, which has no zero entries, and Px would also be the vector of all ones, since permutation matrices just permute the entries. Wait, no. If x is all ones, then Px would permute the entries of x, which are all ones, so Px would still be all ones. So, in that case, both x and Px have all entries non-zero.

But wait, this seems too specific. What if P is a different orthogonal matrix? For example, suppose P is a rotation matrix in 2D. Let&#x27;s take n=2. Then, a rotation matrix is orthogonal. Suppose we have a rotation by some angle θ. Then, is there a vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries?

Well, let&#x27;s take x = (1,1). Then, Px would be (cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ). Are there θ such that either component is zero? For example, if θ = 45 degrees, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. Then, Px would be (0, √2). So, the first component is zero. Oh, so in this case, x = (1,1) would result in Px having a zero entry. But does there exist another x with no zero entries such that Px also has none?

Suppose we take x = (a, b) with a, b ≠ 0. Then, Px = (a cosθ - b sinθ, a sinθ + b cosθ). For this to have no zeros, we need a cosθ - b sinθ ≠ 0 and a sinθ + b cosθ ≠ 0.

So, can we choose a and b such that these are satisfied? Let&#x27;s see. If θ is 45 degrees, as above, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. So, the first component becomes (a - b)√2/2 and the second component becomes (a + b)√2/2. So, to have both components non-zero, we need a ≠ b and a ≠ -b. So, as long as a ≠ b and a ≠ -b, then x = (a, b) would work. For example, take a = 1, b = 2. Then, both components are non-zero. So, even though x = (1,1) leads to a zero in the first component, another x with non-zero entries can work.

Therefore, in 2D, even if the rotation matrix can map some non-zero vectors to ones with zeros, there still exist vectors with no zero entries that are mapped to vectors with no zero entries. So, maybe in general, such vectors exist?

Alternatively, maybe we can use a density argument. The set of vectors with no zero entries is dense in R^n. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also dense, since it&#x27;s the complement of the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P. Since the union of hyperplanes has measure zero, their complement is dense. Therefore, the intersection of these two sets (vectors with no zero entries such that Px also has none) is also dense, hence non-empty.

Wait, that might be a more abstract way to see it. Let me elaborate. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the coordinate hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. Each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is a closed set with empty interior. Similarly, the set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}, where p_i are the rows of P. Again, each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is closed with empty interior. Therefore, both complements are open and dense in R^n. The intersection of two open dense sets is also open and dense, hence non-empty. Therefore, there must exist vectors x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, since the rows of P form an orthonormal basis, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are n distinct hyperplanes. The set of vectors not lying in any of these hyperplanes is the complement of their union, which is dense. Similarly, the set of vectors with no zero entries is the complement of the union of coordinate hyperplanes, also dense. The intersection of these two dense sets is non-empty by the Baire Category Theorem, which states that in a complete metric space (like R^n), the intersection of countably many dense open sets is dense. Since we&#x27;re dealing with finite unions of hyperplanes, the complements are open and dense, so their intersection is dense, hence non-empty.

Therefore, such a vector x must exist. Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector exists.

Wait, but let me test this with a specific example. Suppose P is the identity matrix. Then, the rows are the standard basis vectors. So, the hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. The set of vectors with no zero entries is exactly the complement of the union of these hyperplanes. So, in this case, the vectors x with no zero entries are exactly those for which Px (which is x itself) has no zero entries. So, in this case, the two conditions are the same, so the intersection is the same set, which is non-empty. So, works here.

Another example: Let P be a permutation matrix. Then, as before, x with all non-zero entries will be permuted, so Px will have the same entries as x but in different order. Therefore, Px will also have no zero entries. Therefore, in this case, any x with no zero entries works. So, definitely exists.

Another example: Take P to be a rotation matrix in 3D. Suppose we rotate around some axis. Then, similar to the 2D case, can we find a vector x with all non-zero entries such that Px also has all non-zero entries? Let&#x27;s see. Let’s take x = (1,1,1). If we rotate x by some angle, the result might not have any zero entries, depending on the rotation. But even if it does, we can perturb x slightly to avoid zeros. For example, if rotating x = (1,1,1) by 90 degrees around the z-axis gives ( -1, 1, 1), which still has no zeros. Wait, but a 90 degree rotation around z-axis would send (x, y, z) to (-y, x, z). So, x = (1,1,1) becomes (-1, 1, 1), which indeed has no zeros. So in this case, it works. But maybe another rotation could cause a zero? Suppose we have a rotation that aligns a vector with an axis. Wait, but if we rotate a vector with all non-zero entries, would it ever result in a zero? For example, rotating (1,1,1) around some axis by some angle. If the rotation is such that one component becomes zero, then that would require that vector to be orthogonal to one of the coordinate axes, but (1,1,1) is not orthogonal to any coordinate axis unless we have specific rotations. Wait, but actually, any rotation is an orthogonal transformation, but to get a zero component, you would need the rotated vector to lie on a coordinate hyperplane. However, if the original vector is not on any rotated hyperplane corresponding to the coordinate axes, then the rotated vector won&#x27;t have zeros. But perhaps this is too vague.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider specific angles. Suppose we rotate (1,1,1) by 45 degrees around some axis. Depending on the axis, this might or might not introduce zeros. But maybe choosing an axis that isn&#x27;t aligned with the coordinate axes. For example, rotating around the vector (1,1,1) itself by some angle. Then, the vector (1,1,1) would remain unchanged, so no zeros. If we rotate around another axis, say (1,0,0), by 45 degrees. Then, the rotation in the y-z plane. The x-component remains 1, and y and z components become (y cosθ - z sinθ, y sinθ + z cosθ). So, with θ = 45 degrees, y and z components become ( (y - z)/√2, (y + z)/√2 ). If original x is (1,1,1), then after rotation, it becomes (1, (1 - 1)/√2 = 0, (1 + 1)/√2 = √2 ). So, the y-component becomes zero. Oh, so in this case, rotating (1,1,1) around the x-axis by 45 degrees results in a vector with a zero entry. But then, does that mean that for this particular rotation matrix, the vector x = (1,1,1) leads to Px having a zero? But the question is whether there exists some x with no zero entries such that Px also has none. In this case, even though (1,1,1) doesn&#x27;t work, maybe another vector does. For example, take x = (1, 2, 1). Then, rotating around x-axis by 45 degrees gives (1, (2 - 1)/√2, (2 + 1)/√2 ) = (1, 1/√2, 3/√2 ), which has no zeros. So, yes, such a vector exists. So even if some vectors lead to zeros after transformation, others don&#x27;t.

This seems to support the idea that regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, we can always find such a vector x. The key idea is that the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P and the coordinate hyperplanes have measure zero, so their complements intersect.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the set S of vectors x with no zero entries. This is an open set in R^n (since it&#x27;s the complement of the closed set where at least one coordinate is zero). Similarly, the set T of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open, as it&#x27;s the complement of the union of hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}. Since P is orthogonal, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are distinct from the coordinate hyperplanes if P is not a permutation matrix. But even if they overlap, the important thing is that both S and T are open and dense. The intersection of two open dense sets is non-empty in R^n, as R^n is a Baire space. Therefore, S ∩ T ≠ ∅, meaning there exists a vector x in both S and T, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of linear algebra, suppose we want to find x such that x_i ≠ 0 for all i, and (Px)_j ≠ 0 for all j. Let me try to construct such an x. Since P is invertible (orthogonal matrices are invertible), the mapping x ↦ Px is a bijection. Therefore, the image of the set S (vectors with no zero entries) under P is the same as the set T. Since S is open and dense, and P is a homeomorphism (continuous bijection with continuous inverse), then T = P(S) is also open and dense. Therefore, T ∩ S is the intersection of two open dense sets, which must be non-empty. Therefore, there exists x in S such that Px is also in S, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, this seems like a solid argument. Since S is open and dense, and T = P(S) is also open and dense, their intersection is non-empty. Therefore, yes, such an x exists.

But let me check if this reasoning holds. If S is the set of vectors with no zero entries, and T is the set of vectors y such that y = Px has no zero entries, which is equivalent to x = P^T y having no zero entries? Wait, no. T is the set of x such that Px has no zero entries. So, T = {x | Px ∈ S}. Since P is invertible, T = P^{-1}(S). Since S is open and dense, and P^{-1} is a homeomorphism, T is also open and dense. Therefore, S and T are both open and dense, so their intersection is non-empty.

Therefore, there exists x ∈ S ∩ T, which means x has no zero entries, and Px also has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector x exists.

But let me see if I can construct such a vector explicitly. Suppose we take a vector x with all entries equal to 1. Then, Px is the sum of the columns of P. Wait, no, if x is all ones, then Px is the sum of the columns of P scaled by 1. But the columns of P are orthonormal. The sum of the columns of P would be a vector whose norm squared is n, since each column is a unit vector and they are orthogonal. So, the sum would have norm sqrt(n). But does the sum have any zero entries? Not necessarily. For example, if P is the identity matrix, then the sum is (1,1,...,1), which has no zeros. If P is a permutation matrix, the sum is also (1,1,...,1). If P is a rotation matrix, the sum could be different. For instance, in 2D, if P is a rotation by θ, then the sum of the columns would be [cosθ + (-sinθ), sinθ + cosθ], which is [cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ]. For θ = 45 degrees, this becomes [0, √2], which has a zero. So, in that case, x being all ones would result in Px having a zero. But as we saw before, if we take x = (1, 2), then Px might not have any zeros. So, the all-ones vector might not work, but another vector might.

Alternatively, maybe a vector with all entries positive. Since if all entries are positive, then Px is a linear combination of the columns of P with positive coefficients. But the columns of P are orthonormal, so they form a basis. If all coefficients are positive, can such a combination result in a zero entry? Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a vector x with all positive entries such that Px has a zero entry. Then, the zero entry corresponds to a row of P (since Px is computed by row-wise dot products). So, there exists a row p_i of P such that p_i ⋅ x = 0. But x has all positive entries, and p_i is a unit vector. However, the dot product being zero would mean that p_i is orthogonal to x. But since x is in the positive orthant, and p_i is a unit vector, is it possible for p_i to be orthogonal to x?

Yes, it&#x27;s possible. For example, take p_i = (1, -1, 0, ..., 0)/sqrt(2). Then, the dot product with x = (1,1,1,...,1) would be (1 - 1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + ... + 0 = 0. So, even with x having all positive entries, p_i ⋅ x can be zero. Therefore, just having positive entries is not sufficient. But the question is whether there exists some x with all non-zero entries (not necessarily all positive) such that p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0 for all i.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the function f(x) = (Px)_1 * (Px)_2 * ... * (Px)_n * x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_n. We need to find x such that f(x) ≠ 0. Since f is the product of all entries of Px and all entries of x, it&#x27;s a polynomial in the entries of x. The set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the hyperplanes {x_i = 0} and {p_i ⋅ x = 0} for each i. Since we are in R^n, and the zero set of a non-zero polynomial has measure zero, but f is the product of 2n linear terms, which is a non-zero polynomial. Wait, but actually, f(x) is the product of n terms from Px and n terms from x, so total degree 2n. However, the set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the 2n hyperplanes. But since these hyperplanes are all of codimension 1, their union is a closed set with empty interior. Therefore, the complement, where f(x) ≠ 0, is open and dense. Therefore, there exist vectors x where f(x) ≠ 0, which means all entries of x and all entries of Px are non-zero. Hence, such vectors exist.

This again confirms that the answer is yes.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for each row p_i of P, the hyperplane p_i ⋅ x = 0 does not contain any of the coordinate hyperplanes x_j = 0, unless p_i is aligned with some coordinate axis. But since P is orthogonal, if any row p_i were aligned with a coordinate axis, then the corresponding column would also be that axis vector, making P a permutation matrix (possibly with sign changes). But even if P is a permutation matrix with sign changes (i.e., generalized permutation matrix), then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 correspond to x_j = 0 for some j, depending on the permutation and sign. However, in such a case, avoiding those hyperplanes would correspond to avoiding certain coordinate hyperplanes. But if P is a generalized permutation matrix, then Px is just a permutation of x with possible sign changes. Therefore, if we choose x with all entries non-zero, then Px will also have all entries non-zero, since permutation and sign changes don&#x27;t introduce zeros. Therefore, in that case, any x with no zero entries works. 

If P is not a generalized permutation matrix, then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 are not coordinate hyperplanes, so the union of these hyperplanes and the coordinate hyperplanes is a union of 2n distinct hyperplanes (assuming no overlap). However, even if there is overlap, the key point is that the union is a closed set with empty interior, so the complement is open and dense. Therefore, regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, the existence of such an x is guaranteed.

To summarize:

1. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is open and dense.
2. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open and dense.
3. The intersection of these two sets is non-empty due to the Baire Category Theorem.
4. Therefore, there must exist at least one vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Therefore, the answer is yes, such a vector x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given an orthogonal matrix \( P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \), we need to determine whether there exists a vector \( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \) with no zero entries such that \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

1. **Orthogonal Matrix Properties**: An orthogonal matrix \( P \) has orthonormal rows and columns, meaning \( P^T P = I \). This implies that the rows of \( P \) form an orthonormal basis for \( \mathbb{R}^n \).

2. **Hyperplanes Consideration**: We need a vector \( x \) such that both \( x \) and \( Px \) have no zero entries. This translates to finding \( x \) such that \( x \) is not orthogonal to any row of \( P \), i.e., \( p_i \cdot x \neq 0 \) for all rows \( p_i \) of \( P \).

3. **Dense Sets Argument**: 
   - The set of vectors with no zero entries (complement of coordinate hyperplanes) is open and dense in \( \mathbb{R}^n \).
   - The set of vectors \( x \) such that \( Px \) has no zero entries (complement of hyperplanes orthogonal to rows of \( P \)) is also open and dense.

4. **Intersection of Dense Sets**: By the Baire Category Theorem, the intersection of two open dense sets in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) is non-empty. Therefore, there exists a vector \( x \) that lies in both sets, meaning \( x \) has no zero entries and \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

5. **Conclusion**: The existence of such a vector \( x \) is guaranteed by the density and openness arguments, confirming that the required vector exists for any orthogonal matrix \( P \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem: Given an orthogonal matrix P in R^{n x n}, does there exist a vector x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries? Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall what an orthogonal matrix is. An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix whose columns and rows are orthonormal vectors. That means P^T P = I, where P^T is the transpose of P and I is the identity matrix. So, the inverse of P is just its transpose. Orthogonal matrices preserve the dot product, so they preserve angles and lengths. That means transformations like rotations and reflections are orthogonal.

Now, the question is about whether there&#x27;s a vector x with all non-zero entries such that when we multiply it by P, the resulting vector also has all non-zero entries. So, both x and Px must have no zeros in any of their components. 

Let me rephrase the problem: We need to find a vector x in R^n with all entries non-zero such that none of the entries of Px are zero. Alternatively, for each row of P, the dot product with x is non-zero. So, for each row vector p_i of P, p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0. So, the problem reduces to finding an x with all entries non-zero that is not orthogonal to any of the rows of P.

Since P is orthogonal, its rows form an orthonormal basis for R^n. So, the rows are unit vectors and mutually orthogonal. But we need a vector x that is not orthogonal to any of these rows. So, x cannot be orthogonal to any row of P.

But is such an x guaranteed to exist? Hmm. Let me think. In R^n, given a finite set of vectors (in this case, n orthonormal vectors), does there exist a vector that is not orthogonal to any of them?

Alternatively, the question is: Can we find a vector x such that for each i from 1 to n, the inner product of x with the i-th row of P is not zero. Since the rows are orthonormal, they form a basis. So, x can be expressed in terms of this basis. But x is in R^n, so any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the rows. Wait, but the rows themselves are orthonormal, so if we express x as a combination of the rows, then the coefficients would just be the inner products of x with each row. But if we require that all those coefficients are non-zero, then x must have a non-zero component in each row direction. So, in other words, if we write x = c_1 p_1 + c_2 p_2 + ... + c_n p_n, where p_i are the rows of P, then all c_i must be non-zero. But since the rows of P form a basis, any x can be written this way, and we can choose the coefficients c_i to be non-zero. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, but hold on. If we set x to be the sum of all the rows with coefficients 1, then x = p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n, and then Px would be... Wait, no, P is the matrix whose rows are p_i, so multiplying P by x would give us a vector where each component is p_i ⋅ x. But if x is the sum of all p_j, then p_i ⋅ x = p_i ⋅ (p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n) = p_i ⋅ p_i + sum_{j ≠ i} p_i ⋅ p_j. Since the rows are orthonormal, p_i ⋅ p_j = δ_{ij}, so this simplifies to 1 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1. So, Px would be a vector of all ones. Therefore, in that case, x = p_1 + ... + p_n would have Px = (1,1,...,1)^T, which has no zero entries. But wait, does x itself have non-zero entries? Not necessarily. If the sum of the rows of P results in a vector with all non-zero entries, then we&#x27;re done. But maybe in some cases, the sum of the rows could have a zero entry. For example, if P is a permutation matrix, say swapping two coordinates, then the sum of the rows would be (1,1), which in higher dimensions might still have all entries non-zero? Wait, no, a permutation matrix in higher dimensions just permutes the entries. So, if you sum all the rows of a permutation matrix, you would get a vector of all ones, right? Because each row has a single 1 and the rest zeros, and summing all rows would give a vector with n ones. So, in that case, x would be the vector of all ones, which has no zero entries, and Px would also be the vector of all ones, since permutation matrices just permute the entries. Wait, no. If x is all ones, then Px would permute the entries of x, which are all ones, so Px would still be all ones. So, in that case, both x and Px have all entries non-zero.

But wait, this seems too specific. What if P is a different orthogonal matrix? For example, suppose P is a rotation matrix in 2D. Let&#x27;s take n=2. Then, a rotation matrix is orthogonal. Suppose we have a rotation by some angle θ. Then, is there a vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries?

Well, let&#x27;s take x = (1,1). Then, Px would be (cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ). Are there θ such that either component is zero? For example, if θ = 45 degrees, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. Then, Px would be (0, √2). So, the first component is zero. Oh, so in this case, x = (1,1) would result in Px having a zero entry. But does there exist another x with no zero entries such that Px also has none?

Suppose we take x = (a, b) with a, b ≠ 0. Then, Px = (a cosθ - b sinθ, a sinθ + b cosθ). For this to have no zeros, we need a cosθ - b sinθ ≠ 0 and a sinθ + b cosθ ≠ 0.

So, can we choose a and b such that these are satisfied? Let&#x27;s see. If θ is 45 degrees, as above, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. So, the first component becomes (a - b)√2/2 and the second component becomes (a + b)√2/2. So, to have both components non-zero, we need a ≠ b and a ≠ -b. So, as long as a ≠ b and a ≠ -b, then x = (a, b) would work. For example, take a = 1, b = 2. Then, both components are non-zero. So, even though x = (1,1) leads to a zero in the first component, another x with non-zero entries can work.

Therefore, in 2D, even if the rotation matrix can map some non-zero vectors to ones with zeros, there still exist vectors with no zero entries that are mapped to vectors with no zero entries. So, maybe in general, such vectors exist?

Alternatively, maybe we can use a density argument. The set of vectors with no zero entries is dense in R^n. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also dense, since it&#x27;s the complement of the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P. Since the union of hyperplanes has measure zero, their complement is dense. Therefore, the intersection of these two sets (vectors with no zero entries such that Px also has none) is also dense, hence non-empty.

Wait, that might be a more abstract way to see it. Let me elaborate. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the coordinate hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. Each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is a closed set with empty interior. Similarly, the set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}, where p_i are the rows of P. Again, each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is closed with empty interior. Therefore, both complements are open and dense in R^n. The intersection of two open dense sets is also open and dense, hence non-empty. Therefore, there must exist vectors x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, since the rows of P form an orthonormal basis, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are n distinct hyperplanes. The set of vectors not lying in any of these hyperplanes is the complement of their union, which is dense. Similarly, the set of vectors with no zero entries is the complement of the union of coordinate hyperplanes, also dense. The intersection of these two dense sets is non-empty by the Baire Category Theorem, which states that in a complete metric space (like R^n), the intersection of countably many dense open sets is dense. Since we&#x27;re dealing with finite unions of hyperplanes, the complements are open and dense, so their intersection is dense, hence non-empty.

Therefore, such a vector x must exist. Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector exists.

Wait, but let me test this with a specific example. Suppose P is the identity matrix. Then, the rows are the standard basis vectors. So, the hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. The set of vectors with no zero entries is exactly the complement of the union of these hyperplanes. So, in this case, the vectors x with no zero entries are exactly those for which Px (which is x itself) has no zero entries. So, in this case, the two conditions are the same, so the intersection is the same set, which is non-empty. So, works here.

Another example: Let P be a permutation matrix. Then, as before, x with all non-zero entries will be permuted, so Px will have the same entries as x but in different order. Therefore, Px will also have no zero entries. Therefore, in this case, any x with no zero entries works. So, definitely exists.

Another example: Take P to be a rotation matrix in 3D. Suppose we rotate around some axis. Then, similar to the 2D case, can we find a vector x with all non-zero entries such that Px also has all non-zero entries? Let&#x27;s see. Let’s take x = (1,1,1). If we rotate x by some angle, the result might not have any zero entries, depending on the rotation. But even if it does, we can perturb x slightly to avoid zeros. For example, if rotating x = (1,1,1) by 90 degrees around the z-axis gives ( -1, 1, 1), which still has no zeros. Wait, but a 90 degree rotation around z-axis would send (x, y, z) to (-y, x, z). So, x = (1,1,1) becomes (-1, 1, 1), which indeed has no zeros. So in this case, it works. But maybe another rotation could cause a zero? Suppose we have a rotation that aligns a vector with an axis. Wait, but if we rotate a vector with all non-zero entries, would it ever result in a zero? For example, rotating (1,1,1) around some axis by some angle. If the rotation is such that one component becomes zero, then that would require that vector to be orthogonal to one of the coordinate axes, but (1,1,1) is not orthogonal to any coordinate axis unless we have specific rotations. Wait, but actually, any rotation is an orthogonal transformation, but to get a zero component, you would need the rotated vector to lie on a coordinate hyperplane. However, if the original vector is not on any rotated hyperplane corresponding to the coordinate axes, then the rotated vector won&#x27;t have zeros. But perhaps this is too vague.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider specific angles. Suppose we rotate (1,1,1) by 45 degrees around some axis. Depending on the axis, this might or might not introduce zeros. But maybe choosing an axis that isn&#x27;t aligned with the coordinate axes. For example, rotating around the vector (1,1,1) itself by some angle. Then, the vector (1,1,1) would remain unchanged, so no zeros. If we rotate around another axis, say (1,0,0), by 45 degrees. Then, the rotation in the y-z plane. The x-component remains 1, and y and z components become (y cosθ - z sinθ, y sinθ + z cosθ). So, with θ = 45 degrees, y and z components become ( (y - z)/√2, (y + z)/√2 ). If original x is (1,1,1), then after rotation, it becomes (1, (1 - 1)/√2 = 0, (1 + 1)/√2 = √2 ). So, the y-component becomes zero. Oh, so in this case, rotating (1,1,1) around the x-axis by 45 degrees results in a vector with a zero entry. But then, does that mean that for this particular rotation matrix, the vector x = (1,1,1) leads to Px having a zero? But the question is whether there exists some x with no zero entries such that Px also has none. In this case, even though (1,1,1) doesn&#x27;t work, maybe another vector does. For example, take x = (1, 2, 1). Then, rotating around x-axis by 45 degrees gives (1, (2 - 1)/√2, (2 + 1)/√2 ) = (1, 1/√2, 3/√2 ), which has no zeros. So, yes, such a vector exists. So even if some vectors lead to zeros after transformation, others don&#x27;t.

This seems to support the idea that regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, we can always find such a vector x. The key idea is that the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P and the coordinate hyperplanes have measure zero, so their complements intersect.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the set S of vectors x with no zero entries. This is an open set in R^n (since it&#x27;s the complement of the closed set where at least one coordinate is zero). Similarly, the set T of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open, as it&#x27;s the complement of the union of hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}. Since P is orthogonal, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are distinct from the coordinate hyperplanes if P is not a permutation matrix. But even if they overlap, the important thing is that both S and T are open and dense. The intersection of two open dense sets is non-empty in R^n, as R^n is a Baire space. Therefore, S ∩ T ≠ ∅, meaning there exists a vector x in both S and T, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of linear algebra, suppose we want to find x such that x_i ≠ 0 for all i, and (Px)_j ≠ 0 for all j. Let me try to construct such an x. Since P is invertible (orthogonal matrices are invertible), the mapping x ↦ Px is a bijection. Therefore, the image of the set S (vectors with no zero entries) under P is the same as the set T. Since S is open and dense, and P is a homeomorphism (continuous bijection with continuous inverse), then T = P(S) is also open and dense. Therefore, T ∩ S is the intersection of two open dense sets, which must be non-empty. Therefore, there exists x in S such that Px is also in S, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, this seems like a solid argument. Since S is open and dense, and T = P(S) is also open and dense, their intersection is non-empty. Therefore, yes, such an x exists.

But let me check if this reasoning holds. If S is the set of vectors with no zero entries, and T is the set of vectors y such that y = Px has no zero entries, which is equivalent to x = P^T y having no zero entries? Wait, no. T is the set of x such that Px has no zero entries. So, T = {x | Px ∈ S}. Since P is invertible, T = P^{-1}(S). Since S is open and dense, and P^{-1} is a homeomorphism, T is also open and dense. Therefore, S and T are both open and dense, so their intersection is non-empty.

Therefore, there exists x ∈ S ∩ T, which means x has no zero entries, and Px also has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector x exists.

But let me see if I can construct such a vector explicitly. Suppose we take a vector x with all entries equal to 1. Then, Px is the sum of the columns of P. Wait, no, if x is all ones, then Px is the sum of the columns of P scaled by 1. But the columns of P are orthonormal. The sum of the columns of P would be a vector whose norm squared is n, since each column is a unit vector and they are orthogonal. So, the sum would have norm sqrt(n). But does the sum have any zero entries? Not necessarily. For example, if P is the identity matrix, then the sum is (1,1,...,1), which has no zeros. If P is a permutation matrix, the sum is also (1,1,...,1). If P is a rotation matrix, the sum could be different. For instance, in 2D, if P is a rotation by θ, then the sum of the columns would be [cosθ + (-sinθ), sinθ + cosθ], which is [cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ]. For θ = 45 degrees, this becomes [0, √2], which has a zero. So, in that case, x being all ones would result in Px having a zero. But as we saw before, if we take x = (1, 2), then Px might not have any zeros. So, the all-ones vector might not work, but another vector might.

Alternatively, maybe a vector with all entries positive. Since if all entries are positive, then Px is a linear combination of the columns of P with positive coefficients. But the columns of P are orthonormal, so they form a basis. If all coefficients are positive, can such a combination result in a zero entry? Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a vector x with all positive entries such that Px has a zero entry. Then, the zero entry corresponds to a row of P (since Px is computed by row-wise dot products). So, there exists a row p_i of P such that p_i ⋅ x = 0. But x has all positive entries, and p_i is a unit vector. However, the dot product being zero would mean that p_i is orthogonal to x. But since x is in the positive orthant, and p_i is a unit vector, is it possible for p_i to be orthogonal to x?

Yes, it&#x27;s possible. For example, take p_i = (1, -1, 0, ..., 0)/sqrt(2). Then, the dot product with x = (1,1,1,...,1) would be (1 - 1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + ... + 0 = 0. So, even with x having all positive entries, p_i ⋅ x can be zero. Therefore, just having positive entries is not sufficient. But the question is whether there exists some x with all non-zero entries (not necessarily all positive) such that p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0 for all i.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the function f(x) = (Px)_1 * (Px)_2 * ... * (Px)_n * x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_n. We need to find x such that f(x) ≠ 0. Since f is the product of all entries of Px and all entries of x, it&#x27;s a polynomial in the entries of x. The set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the hyperplanes {x_i = 0} and {p_i ⋅ x = 0} for each i. Since we are in R^n, and the zero set of a non-zero polynomial has measure zero, but f is the product of 2n linear terms, which is a non-zero polynomial. Wait, but actually, f(x) is the product of n terms from Px and n terms from x, so total degree 2n. However, the set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the 2n hyperplanes. But since these hyperplanes are all of codimension 1, their union is a closed set with empty interior. Therefore, the complement, where f(x) ≠ 0, is open and dense. Therefore, there exist vectors x where f(x) ≠ 0, which means all entries of x and all entries of Px are non-zero. Hence, such vectors exist.

This again confirms that the answer is yes.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for each row p_i of P, the hyperplane p_i ⋅ x = 0 does not contain any of the coordinate hyperplanes x_j = 0, unless p_i is aligned with some coordinate axis. But since P is orthogonal, if any row p_i were aligned with a coordinate axis, then the corresponding column would also be that axis vector, making P a permutation matrix (possibly with sign changes). But even if P is a permutation matrix with sign changes (i.e., generalized permutation matrix), then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 correspond to x_j = 0 for some j, depending on the permutation and sign. However, in such a case, avoiding those hyperplanes would correspond to avoiding certain coordinate hyperplanes. But if P is a generalized permutation matrix, then Px is just a permutation of x with possible sign changes. Therefore, if we choose x with all entries non-zero, then Px will also have all entries non-zero, since permutation and sign changes don&#x27;t introduce zeros. Therefore, in that case, any x with no zero entries works. 

If P is not a generalized permutation matrix, then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 are not coordinate hyperplanes, so the union of these hyperplanes and the coordinate hyperplanes is a union of 2n distinct hyperplanes (assuming no overlap). However, even if there is overlap, the key point is that the union is a closed set with empty interior, so the complement is open and dense. Therefore, regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, the existence of such an x is guaranteed.

To summarize:

1. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is open and dense.
2. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open and dense.
3. The intersection of these two sets is non-empty due to the Baire Category Theorem.
4. Therefore, there must exist at least one vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Therefore, the answer is yes, such a vector x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given an orthogonal matrix \( P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \), we need to determine whether there exists a vector \( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \) with no zero entries such that \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

1. **Orthogonal Matrix Properties**: An orthogonal matrix \( P \) has orthonormal rows and columns, meaning \( P^T P = I \). This implies that the rows of \( P \) form an orthonormal basis for \( \mathbb{R}^n \).

2. **Hyperplanes Consideration**: We need a vector \( x \) such that both \( x \) and \( Px \) have no zero entries. This translates to finding \( x \) such that \( x \) is not orthogonal to any row of \( P \), i.e., \( p_i \cdot x \neq 0 \) for all rows \( p_i \) of \( P \).

3. **Dense Sets Argument**: 
   - The set of vectors with no zero entries (complement of coordinate hyperplanes) is open and dense in \( \mathbb{R}^n \).
   - The set of vectors \( x \) such that \( Px \) has no zero entries (complement of hyperplanes orthogonal to rows of \( P \)) is also open and dense.

4. **Intersection of Dense Sets**: By the Baire Category Theorem, the intersection of two open dense sets in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) is non-empty. Therefore, there exists a vector \( x \) that lies in both sets, meaning \( x \) has no zero entries and \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

5. **Conclusion**: The existence of such a vector \( x \) is guaranteed by the density and openness arguments, confirming that the required vector exists for any orthogonal matrix \( P \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem: Given an orthogonal matrix P in R^{n x n}, does there exist a vector x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries? Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall what an orthogonal matrix is. An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix whose columns and rows are orthonormal vectors. That means P^T P = I, where P^T is the transpose of P and I is the identity matrix. So, the inverse of P is just its transpose. Orthogonal matrices preserve the dot product, so they preserve angles and lengths. That means transformations like rotations and reflections are orthogonal.

Now, the question is about whether there&#x27;s a vector x with all non-zero entries such that when we multiply it by P, the resulting vector also has all non-zero entries. So, both x and Px must have no zeros in any of their components. 

Let me rephrase the problem: We need to find a vector x in R^n with all entries non-zero such that none of the entries of Px are zero. Alternatively, for each row of P, the dot product with x is non-zero. So, for each row vector p_i of P, p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0. So, the problem reduces to finding an x with all entries non-zero that is not orthogonal to any of the rows of P.

Since P is orthogonal, its rows form an orthonormal basis for R^n. So, the rows are unit vectors and mutually orthogonal. But we need a vector x that is not orthogonal to any of these rows. So, x cannot be orthogonal to any row of P.

But is such an x guaranteed to exist? Hmm. Let me think. In R^n, given a finite set of vectors (in this case, n orthonormal vectors), does there exist a vector that is not orthogonal to any of them?

Alternatively, the question is: Can we find a vector x such that for each i from 1 to n, the inner product of x with the i-th row of P is not zero. Since the rows are orthonormal, they form a basis. So, x can be expressed in terms of this basis. But x is in R^n, so any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the rows. Wait, but the rows themselves are orthonormal, so if we express x as a combination of the rows, then the coefficients would just be the inner products of x with each row. But if we require that all those coefficients are non-zero, then x must have a non-zero component in each row direction. So, in other words, if we write x = c_1 p_1 + c_2 p_2 + ... + c_n p_n, where p_i are the rows of P, then all c_i must be non-zero. But since the rows of P form a basis, any x can be written this way, and we can choose the coefficients c_i to be non-zero. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, but hold on. If we set x to be the sum of all the rows with coefficients 1, then x = p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n, and then Px would be... Wait, no, P is the matrix whose rows are p_i, so multiplying P by x would give us a vector where each component is p_i ⋅ x. But if x is the sum of all p_j, then p_i ⋅ x = p_i ⋅ (p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n) = p_i ⋅ p_i + sum_{j ≠ i} p_i ⋅ p_j. Since the rows are orthonormal, p_i ⋅ p_j = δ_{ij}, so this simplifies to 1 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1. So, Px would be a vector of all ones. Therefore, in that case, x = p_1 + ... + p_n would have Px = (1,1,...,1)^T, which has no zero entries. But wait, does x itself have non-zero entries? Not necessarily. If the sum of the rows of P results in a vector with all non-zero entries, then we&#x27;re done. But maybe in some cases, the sum of the rows could have a zero entry. For example, if P is a permutation matrix, say swapping two coordinates, then the sum of the rows would be (1,1), which in higher dimensions might still have all entries non-zero? Wait, no, a permutation matrix in higher dimensions just permutes the entries. So, if you sum all the rows of a permutation matrix, you would get a vector of all ones, right? Because each row has a single 1 and the rest zeros, and summing all rows would give a vector with n ones. So, in that case, x would be the vector of all ones, which has no zero entries, and Px would also be the vector of all ones, since permutation matrices just permute the entries. Wait, no. If x is all ones, then Px would permute the entries of x, which are all ones, so Px would still be all ones. So, in that case, both x and Px have all entries non-zero.

But wait, this seems too specific. What if P is a different orthogonal matrix? For example, suppose P is a rotation matrix in 2D. Let&#x27;s take n=2. Then, a rotation matrix is orthogonal. Suppose we have a rotation by some angle θ. Then, is there a vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries?

Well, let&#x27;s take x = (1,1). Then, Px would be (cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ). Are there θ such that either component is zero? For example, if θ = 45 degrees, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. Then, Px would be (0, √2). So, the first component is zero. Oh, so in this case, x = (1,1) would result in Px having a zero entry. But does there exist another x with no zero entries such that Px also has none?

Suppose we take x = (a, b) with a, b ≠ 0. Then, Px = (a cosθ - b sinθ, a sinθ + b cosθ). For this to have no zeros, we need a cosθ - b sinθ ≠ 0 and a sinθ + b cosθ ≠ 0.

So, can we choose a and b such that these are satisfied? Let&#x27;s see. If θ is 45 degrees, as above, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. So, the first component becomes (a - b)√2/2 and the second component becomes (a + b)√2/2. So, to have both components non-zero, we need a ≠ b and a ≠ -b. So, as long as a ≠ b and a ≠ -b, then x = (a, b) would work. For example, take a = 1, b = 2. Then, both components are non-zero. So, even though x = (1,1) leads to a zero in the first component, another x with non-zero entries can work.

Therefore, in 2D, even if the rotation matrix can map some non-zero vectors to ones with zeros, there still exist vectors with no zero entries that are mapped to vectors with no zero entries. So, maybe in general, such vectors exist?

Alternatively, maybe we can use a density argument. The set of vectors with no zero entries is dense in R^n. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also dense, since it&#x27;s the complement of the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P. Since the union of hyperplanes has measure zero, their complement is dense. Therefore, the intersection of these two sets (vectors with no zero entries such that Px also has none) is also dense, hence non-empty.

Wait, that might be a more abstract way to see it. Let me elaborate. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the coordinate hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. Each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is a closed set with empty interior. Similarly, the set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}, where p_i are the rows of P. Again, each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is closed with empty interior. Therefore, both complements are open and dense in R^n. The intersection of two open dense sets is also open and dense, hence non-empty. Therefore, there must exist vectors x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, since the rows of P form an orthonormal basis, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are n distinct hyperplanes. The set of vectors not lying in any of these hyperplanes is the complement of their union, which is dense. Similarly, the set of vectors with no zero entries is the complement of the union of coordinate hyperplanes, also dense. The intersection of these two dense sets is non-empty by the Baire Category Theorem, which states that in a complete metric space (like R^n), the intersection of countably many dense open sets is dense. Since we&#x27;re dealing with finite unions of hyperplanes, the complements are open and dense, so their intersection is dense, hence non-empty.

Therefore, such a vector x must exist. Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector exists.

Wait, but let me test this with a specific example. Suppose P is the identity matrix. Then, the rows are the standard basis vectors. So, the hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. The set of vectors with no zero entries is exactly the complement of the union of these hyperplanes. So, in this case, the vectors x with no zero entries are exactly those for which Px (which is x itself) has no zero entries. So, in this case, the two conditions are the same, so the intersection is the same set, which is non-empty. So, works here.

Another example: Let P be a permutation matrix. Then, as before, x with all non-zero entries will be permuted, so Px will have the same entries as x but in different order. Therefore, Px will also have no zero entries. Therefore, in this case, any x with no zero entries works. So, definitely exists.

Another example: Take P to be a rotation matrix in 3D. Suppose we rotate around some axis. Then, similar to the 2D case, can we find a vector x with all non-zero entries such that Px also has all non-zero entries? Let&#x27;s see. Let’s take x = (1,1,1). If we rotate x by some angle, the result might not have any zero entries, depending on the rotation. But even if it does, we can perturb x slightly to avoid zeros. For example, if rotating x = (1,1,1) by 90 degrees around the z-axis gives ( -1, 1, 1), which still has no zeros. Wait, but a 90 degree rotation around z-axis would send (x, y, z) to (-y, x, z). So, x = (1,1,1) becomes (-1, 1, 1), which indeed has no zeros. So in this case, it works. But maybe another rotation could cause a zero? Suppose we have a rotation that aligns a vector with an axis. Wait, but if we rotate a vector with all non-zero entries, would it ever result in a zero? For example, rotating (1,1,1) around some axis by some angle. If the rotation is such that one component becomes zero, then that would require that vector to be orthogonal to one of the coordinate axes, but (1,1,1) is not orthogonal to any coordinate axis unless we have specific rotations. Wait, but actually, any rotation is an orthogonal transformation, but to get a zero component, you would need the rotated vector to lie on a coordinate hyperplane. However, if the original vector is not on any rotated hyperplane corresponding to the coordinate axes, then the rotated vector won&#x27;t have zeros. But perhaps this is too vague.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider specific angles. Suppose we rotate (1,1,1) by 45 degrees around some axis. Depending on the axis, this might or might not introduce zeros. But maybe choosing an axis that isn&#x27;t aligned with the coordinate axes. For example, rotating around the vector (1,1,1) itself by some angle. Then, the vector (1,1,1) would remain unchanged, so no zeros. If we rotate around another axis, say (1,0,0), by 45 degrees. Then, the rotation in the y-z plane. The x-component remains 1, and y and z components become (y cosθ - z sinθ, y sinθ + z cosθ). So, with θ = 45 degrees, y and z components become ( (y - z)/√2, (y + z)/√2 ). If original x is (1,1,1), then after rotation, it becomes (1, (1 - 1)/√2 = 0, (1 + 1)/√2 = √2 ). So, the y-component becomes zero. Oh, so in this case, rotating (1,1,1) around the x-axis by 45 degrees results in a vector with a zero entry. But then, does that mean that for this particular rotation matrix, the vector x = (1,1,1) leads to Px having a zero? But the question is whether there exists some x with no zero entries such that Px also has none. In this case, even though (1,1,1) doesn&#x27;t work, maybe another vector does. For example, take x = (1, 2, 1). Then, rotating around x-axis by 45 degrees gives (1, (2 - 1)/√2, (2 + 1)/√2 ) = (1, 1/√2, 3/√2 ), which has no zeros. So, yes, such a vector exists. So even if some vectors lead to zeros after transformation, others don&#x27;t.

This seems to support the idea that regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, we can always find such a vector x. The key idea is that the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P and the coordinate hyperplanes have measure zero, so their complements intersect.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the set S of vectors x with no zero entries. This is an open set in R^n (since it&#x27;s the complement of the closed set where at least one coordinate is zero). Similarly, the set T of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open, as it&#x27;s the complement of the union of hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}. Since P is orthogonal, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are distinct from the coordinate hyperplanes if P is not a permutation matrix. But even if they overlap, the important thing is that both S and T are open and dense. The intersection of two open dense sets is non-empty in R^n, as R^n is a Baire space. Therefore, S ∩ T ≠ ∅, meaning there exists a vector x in both S and T, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of linear algebra, suppose we want to find x such that x_i ≠ 0 for all i, and (Px)_j ≠ 0 for all j. Let me try to construct such an x. Since P is invertible (orthogonal matrices are invertible), the mapping x ↦ Px is a bijection. Therefore, the image of the set S (vectors with no zero entries) under P is the same as the set T. Since S is open and dense, and P is a homeomorphism (continuous bijection with continuous inverse), then T = P(S) is also open and dense. Therefore, T ∩ S is the intersection of two open dense sets, which must be non-empty. Therefore, there exists x in S such that Px is also in S, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, this seems like a solid argument. Since S is open and dense, and T = P(S) is also open and dense, their intersection is non-empty. Therefore, yes, such an x exists.

But let me check if this reasoning holds. If S is the set of vectors with no zero entries, and T is the set of vectors y such that y = Px has no zero entries, which is equivalent to x = P^T y having no zero entries? Wait, no. T is the set of x such that Px has no zero entries. So, T = {x | Px ∈ S}. Since P is invertible, T = P^{-1}(S). Since S is open and dense, and P^{-1} is a homeomorphism, T is also open and dense. Therefore, S and T are both open and dense, so their intersection is non-empty.

Therefore, there exists x ∈ S ∩ T, which means x has no zero entries, and Px also has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector x exists.

But let me see if I can construct such a vector explicitly. Suppose we take a vector x with all entries equal to 1. Then, Px is the sum of the columns of P. Wait, no, if x is all ones, then Px is the sum of the columns of P scaled by 1. But the columns of P are orthonormal. The sum of the columns of P would be a vector whose norm squared is n, since each column is a unit vector and they are orthogonal. So, the sum would have norm sqrt(n). But does the sum have any zero entries? Not necessarily. For example, if P is the identity matrix, then the sum is (1,1,...,1), which has no zeros. If P is a permutation matrix, the sum is also (1,1,...,1). If P is a rotation matrix, the sum could be different. For instance, in 2D, if P is a rotation by θ, then the sum of the columns would be [cosθ + (-sinθ), sinθ + cosθ], which is [cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ]. For θ = 45 degrees, this becomes [0, √2], which has a zero. So, in that case, x being all ones would result in Px having a zero. But as we saw before, if we take x = (1, 2), then Px might not have any zeros. So, the all-ones vector might not work, but another vector might.

Alternatively, maybe a vector with all entries positive. Since if all entries are positive, then Px is a linear combination of the columns of P with positive coefficients. But the columns of P are orthonormal, so they form a basis. If all coefficients are positive, can such a combination result in a zero entry? Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a vector x with all positive entries such that Px has a zero entry. Then, the zero entry corresponds to a row of P (since Px is computed by row-wise dot products). So, there exists a row p_i of P such that p_i ⋅ x = 0. But x has all positive entries, and p_i is a unit vector. However, the dot product being zero would mean that p_i is orthogonal to x. But since x is in the positive orthant, and p_i is a unit vector, is it possible for p_i to be orthogonal to x?

Yes, it&#x27;s possible. For example, take p_i = (1, -1, 0, ..., 0)/sqrt(2). Then, the dot product with x = (1,1,1,...,1) would be (1 - 1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + ... + 0 = 0. So, even with x having all positive entries, p_i ⋅ x can be zero. Therefore, just having positive entries is not sufficient. But the question is whether there exists some x with all non-zero entries (not necessarily all positive) such that p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0 for all i.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the function f(x) = (Px)_1 * (Px)_2 * ... * (Px)_n * x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_n. We need to find x such that f(x) ≠ 0. Since f is the product of all entries of Px and all entries of x, it&#x27;s a polynomial in the entries of x. The set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the hyperplanes {x_i = 0} and {p_i ⋅ x = 0} for each i. Since we are in R^n, and the zero set of a non-zero polynomial has measure zero, but f is the product of 2n linear terms, which is a non-zero polynomial. Wait, but actually, f(x) is the product of n terms from Px and n terms from x, so total degree 2n. However, the set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the 2n hyperplanes. But since these hyperplanes are all of codimension 1, their union is a closed set with empty interior. Therefore, the complement, where f(x) ≠ 0, is open and dense. Therefore, there exist vectors x where f(x) ≠ 0, which means all entries of x and all entries of Px are non-zero. Hence, such vectors exist.

This again confirms that the answer is yes.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for each row p_i of P, the hyperplane p_i ⋅ x = 0 does not contain any of the coordinate hyperplanes x_j = 0, unless p_i is aligned with some coordinate axis. But since P is orthogonal, if any row p_i were aligned with a coordinate axis, then the corresponding column would also be that axis vector, making P a permutation matrix (possibly with sign changes). But even if P is a permutation matrix with sign changes (i.e., generalized permutation matrix), then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 correspond to x_j = 0 for some j, depending on the permutation and sign. However, in such a case, avoiding those hyperplanes would correspond to avoiding certain coordinate hyperplanes. But if P is a generalized permutation matrix, then Px is just a permutation of x with possible sign changes. Therefore, if we choose x with all entries non-zero, then Px will also have all entries non-zero, since permutation and sign changes don&#x27;t introduce zeros. Therefore, in that case, any x with no zero entries works. 

If P is not a generalized permutation matrix, then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 are not coordinate hyperplanes, so the union of these hyperplanes and the coordinate hyperplanes is a union of 2n distinct hyperplanes (assuming no overlap). However, even if there is overlap, the key point is that the union is a closed set with empty interior, so the complement is open and dense. Therefore, regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, the existence of such an x is guaranteed.

To summarize:

1. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is open and dense.
2. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open and dense.
3. The intersection of these two sets is non-empty due to the Baire Category Theorem.
4. Therefore, there must exist at least one vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Therefore, the answer is yes, such a vector x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem: Given an orthogonal matrix P in R^{n x n}, does there exist a vector x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries? Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall what an orthogonal matrix is. An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix whose columns and rows are orthonormal vectors. That means P^T P = I, where P^T is the transpose of P and I is the identity matrix. So, the inverse of P is just its transpose. Orthogonal matrices preserve the dot product, so they preserve angles and lengths. That means transformations like rotations and reflections are orthogonal.

Now, the question is about whether there&#x27;s a vector x with all non-zero entries such that when we multiply it by P, the resulting vector also has all non-zero entries. So, both x and Px must have no zeros in any of their components. 

Let me rephrase the problem: We need to find a vector x in R^n with all entries non-zero such that none of the entries of Px are zero. Alternatively, for each row of P, the dot product with x is non-zero. So, for each row vector p_i of P, p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0. So, the problem reduces to finding an x with all entries non-zero that is not orthogonal to any of the rows of P.

Since P is orthogonal, its rows form an orthonormal basis for R^n. So, the rows are unit vectors and mutually orthogonal. But we need a vector x that is not orthogonal to any of these rows. So, x cannot be orthogonal to any row of P.

But is such an x guaranteed to exist? Hmm. Let me think. In R^n, given a finite set of vectors (in this case, n orthonormal vectors), does there exist a vector that is not orthogonal to any of them?

Alternatively, the question is: Can we find a vector x such that for each i from 1 to n, the inner product of x with the i-th row of P is not zero. Since the rows are orthonormal, they form a basis. So, x can be expressed in terms of this basis. But x is in R^n, so any vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the rows. Wait, but the rows themselves are orthonormal, so if we express x as a combination of the rows, then the coefficients would just be the inner products of x with each row. But if we require that all those coefficients are non-zero, then x must have a non-zero component in each row direction. So, in other words, if we write x = c_1 p_1 + c_2 p_2 + ... + c_n p_n, where p_i are the rows of P, then all c_i must be non-zero. But since the rows of P form a basis, any x can be written this way, and we can choose the coefficients c_i to be non-zero. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, but hold on. If we set x to be the sum of all the rows with coefficients 1, then x = p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n, and then Px would be... Wait, no, P is the matrix whose rows are p_i, so multiplying P by x would give us a vector where each component is p_i ⋅ x. But if x is the sum of all p_j, then p_i ⋅ x = p_i ⋅ (p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n) = p_i ⋅ p_i + sum_{j ≠ i} p_i ⋅ p_j. Since the rows are orthonormal, p_i ⋅ p_j = δ_{ij}, so this simplifies to 1 + 0 + ... + 0 = 1. So, Px would be a vector of all ones. Therefore, in that case, x = p_1 + ... + p_n would have Px = (1,1,...,1)^T, which has no zero entries. But wait, does x itself have non-zero entries? Not necessarily. If the sum of the rows of P results in a vector with all non-zero entries, then we&#x27;re done. But maybe in some cases, the sum of the rows could have a zero entry. For example, if P is a permutation matrix, say swapping two coordinates, then the sum of the rows would be (1,1), which in higher dimensions might still have all entries non-zero? Wait, no, a permutation matrix in higher dimensions just permutes the entries. So, if you sum all the rows of a permutation matrix, you would get a vector of all ones, right? Because each row has a single 1 and the rest zeros, and summing all rows would give a vector with n ones. So, in that case, x would be the vector of all ones, which has no zero entries, and Px would also be the vector of all ones, since permutation matrices just permute the entries. Wait, no. If x is all ones, then Px would permute the entries of x, which are all ones, so Px would still be all ones. So, in that case, both x and Px have all entries non-zero.

But wait, this seems too specific. What if P is a different orthogonal matrix? For example, suppose P is a rotation matrix in 2D. Let&#x27;s take n=2. Then, a rotation matrix is orthogonal. Suppose we have a rotation by some angle θ. Then, is there a vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries?

Well, let&#x27;s take x = (1,1). Then, Px would be (cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ). Are there θ such that either component is zero? For example, if θ = 45 degrees, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. Then, Px would be (0, √2). So, the first component is zero. Oh, so in this case, x = (1,1) would result in Px having a zero entry. But does there exist another x with no zero entries such that Px also has none?

Suppose we take x = (a, b) with a, b ≠ 0. Then, Px = (a cosθ - b sinθ, a sinθ + b cosθ). For this to have no zeros, we need a cosθ - b sinθ ≠ 0 and a sinθ + b cosθ ≠ 0.

So, can we choose a and b such that these are satisfied? Let&#x27;s see. If θ is 45 degrees, as above, then cosθ = sinθ = √2/2. So, the first component becomes (a - b)√2/2 and the second component becomes (a + b)√2/2. So, to have both components non-zero, we need a ≠ b and a ≠ -b. So, as long as a ≠ b and a ≠ -b, then x = (a, b) would work. For example, take a = 1, b = 2. Then, both components are non-zero. So, even though x = (1,1) leads to a zero in the first component, another x with non-zero entries can work.

Therefore, in 2D, even if the rotation matrix can map some non-zero vectors to ones with zeros, there still exist vectors with no zero entries that are mapped to vectors with no zero entries. So, maybe in general, such vectors exist?

Alternatively, maybe we can use a density argument. The set of vectors with no zero entries is dense in R^n. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also dense, since it&#x27;s the complement of the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P. Since the union of hyperplanes has measure zero, their complement is dense. Therefore, the intersection of these two sets (vectors with no zero entries such that Px also has none) is also dense, hence non-empty.

Wait, that might be a more abstract way to see it. Let me elaborate. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the coordinate hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. Each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is a closed set with empty interior. Similarly, the set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is R^n minus the union of the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}, where p_i are the rows of P. Again, each of these hyperplanes has dimension n-1, so their union is closed with empty interior. Therefore, both complements are open and dense in R^n. The intersection of two open dense sets is also open and dense, hence non-empty. Therefore, there must exist vectors x in R^n with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, since the rows of P form an orthonormal basis, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are n distinct hyperplanes. The set of vectors not lying in any of these hyperplanes is the complement of their union, which is dense. Similarly, the set of vectors with no zero entries is the complement of the union of coordinate hyperplanes, also dense. The intersection of these two dense sets is non-empty by the Baire Category Theorem, which states that in a complete metric space (like R^n), the intersection of countably many dense open sets is dense. Since we&#x27;re dealing with finite unions of hyperplanes, the complements are open and dense, so their intersection is dense, hence non-empty.

Therefore, such a vector x must exist. Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector exists.

Wait, but let me test this with a specific example. Suppose P is the identity matrix. Then, the rows are the standard basis vectors. So, the hyperplanes {x_i = 0}. The set of vectors with no zero entries is exactly the complement of the union of these hyperplanes. So, in this case, the vectors x with no zero entries are exactly those for which Px (which is x itself) has no zero entries. So, in this case, the two conditions are the same, so the intersection is the same set, which is non-empty. So, works here.

Another example: Let P be a permutation matrix. Then, as before, x with all non-zero entries will be permuted, so Px will have the same entries as x but in different order. Therefore, Px will also have no zero entries. Therefore, in this case, any x with no zero entries works. So, definitely exists.

Another example: Take P to be a rotation matrix in 3D. Suppose we rotate around some axis. Then, similar to the 2D case, can we find a vector x with all non-zero entries such that Px also has all non-zero entries? Let&#x27;s see. Let’s take x = (1,1,1). If we rotate x by some angle, the result might not have any zero entries, depending on the rotation. But even if it does, we can perturb x slightly to avoid zeros. For example, if rotating x = (1,1,1) by 90 degrees around the z-axis gives ( -1, 1, 1), which still has no zeros. Wait, but a 90 degree rotation around z-axis would send (x, y, z) to (-y, x, z). So, x = (1,1,1) becomes (-1, 1, 1), which indeed has no zeros. So in this case, it works. But maybe another rotation could cause a zero? Suppose we have a rotation that aligns a vector with an axis. Wait, but if we rotate a vector with all non-zero entries, would it ever result in a zero? For example, rotating (1,1,1) around some axis by some angle. If the rotation is such that one component becomes zero, then that would require that vector to be orthogonal to one of the coordinate axes, but (1,1,1) is not orthogonal to any coordinate axis unless we have specific rotations. Wait, but actually, any rotation is an orthogonal transformation, but to get a zero component, you would need the rotated vector to lie on a coordinate hyperplane. However, if the original vector is not on any rotated hyperplane corresponding to the coordinate axes, then the rotated vector won&#x27;t have zeros. But perhaps this is too vague.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider specific angles. Suppose we rotate (1,1,1) by 45 degrees around some axis. Depending on the axis, this might or might not introduce zeros. But maybe choosing an axis that isn&#x27;t aligned with the coordinate axes. For example, rotating around the vector (1,1,1) itself by some angle. Then, the vector (1,1,1) would remain unchanged, so no zeros. If we rotate around another axis, say (1,0,0), by 45 degrees. Then, the rotation in the y-z plane. The x-component remains 1, and y and z components become (y cosθ - z sinθ, y sinθ + z cosθ). So, with θ = 45 degrees, y and z components become ( (y - z)/√2, (y + z)/√2 ). If original x is (1,1,1), then after rotation, it becomes (1, (1 - 1)/√2 = 0, (1 + 1)/√2 = √2 ). So, the y-component becomes zero. Oh, so in this case, rotating (1,1,1) around the x-axis by 45 degrees results in a vector with a zero entry. But then, does that mean that for this particular rotation matrix, the vector x = (1,1,1) leads to Px having a zero? But the question is whether there exists some x with no zero entries such that Px also has none. In this case, even though (1,1,1) doesn&#x27;t work, maybe another vector does. For example, take x = (1, 2, 1). Then, rotating around x-axis by 45 degrees gives (1, (2 - 1)/√2, (2 + 1)/√2 ) = (1, 1/√2, 3/√2 ), which has no zeros. So, yes, such a vector exists. So even if some vectors lead to zeros after transformation, others don&#x27;t.

This seems to support the idea that regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, we can always find such a vector x. The key idea is that the union of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the rows of P and the coordinate hyperplanes have measure zero, so their complements intersect.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the set S of vectors x with no zero entries. This is an open set in R^n (since it&#x27;s the complement of the closed set where at least one coordinate is zero). Similarly, the set T of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open, as it&#x27;s the complement of the union of hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0}. Since P is orthogonal, the hyperplanes {p_i ⋅ x = 0} are distinct from the coordinate hyperplanes if P is not a permutation matrix. But even if they overlap, the important thing is that both S and T are open and dense. The intersection of two open dense sets is non-empty in R^n, as R^n is a Baire space. Therefore, S ∩ T ≠ ∅, meaning there exists a vector x in both S and T, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px also has no zero entries.

Alternatively, thinking in terms of linear algebra, suppose we want to find x such that x_i ≠ 0 for all i, and (Px)_j ≠ 0 for all j. Let me try to construct such an x. Since P is invertible (orthogonal matrices are invertible), the mapping x ↦ Px is a bijection. Therefore, the image of the set S (vectors with no zero entries) under P is the same as the set T. Since S is open and dense, and P is a homeomorphism (continuous bijection with continuous inverse), then T = P(S) is also open and dense. Therefore, T ∩ S is the intersection of two open dense sets, which must be non-empty. Therefore, there exists x in S such that Px is also in S, i.e., x has no zero entries and Px has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists.

Wait, this seems like a solid argument. Since S is open and dense, and T = P(S) is also open and dense, their intersection is non-empty. Therefore, yes, such an x exists.

But let me check if this reasoning holds. If S is the set of vectors with no zero entries, and T is the set of vectors y such that y = Px has no zero entries, which is equivalent to x = P^T y having no zero entries? Wait, no. T is the set of x such that Px has no zero entries. So, T = {x | Px ∈ S}. Since P is invertible, T = P^{-1}(S). Since S is open and dense, and P^{-1} is a homeomorphism, T is also open and dense. Therefore, S and T are both open and dense, so their intersection is non-empty.

Therefore, there exists x ∈ S ∩ T, which means x has no zero entries, and Px also has no zero entries. Therefore, such an x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, such a vector x exists.

But let me see if I can construct such a vector explicitly. Suppose we take a vector x with all entries equal to 1. Then, Px is the sum of the columns of P. Wait, no, if x is all ones, then Px is the sum of the columns of P scaled by 1. But the columns of P are orthonormal. The sum of the columns of P would be a vector whose norm squared is n, since each column is a unit vector and they are orthogonal. So, the sum would have norm sqrt(n). But does the sum have any zero entries? Not necessarily. For example, if P is the identity matrix, then the sum is (1,1,...,1), which has no zeros. If P is a permutation matrix, the sum is also (1,1,...,1). If P is a rotation matrix, the sum could be different. For instance, in 2D, if P is a rotation by θ, then the sum of the columns would be [cosθ + (-sinθ), sinθ + cosθ], which is [cosθ - sinθ, sinθ + cosθ]. For θ = 45 degrees, this becomes [0, √2], which has a zero. So, in that case, x being all ones would result in Px having a zero. But as we saw before, if we take x = (1, 2), then Px might not have any zeros. So, the all-ones vector might not work, but another vector might.

Alternatively, maybe a vector with all entries positive. Since if all entries are positive, then Px is a linear combination of the columns of P with positive coefficients. But the columns of P are orthonormal, so they form a basis. If all coefficients are positive, can such a combination result in a zero entry? Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a vector x with all positive entries such that Px has a zero entry. Then, the zero entry corresponds to a row of P (since Px is computed by row-wise dot products). So, there exists a row p_i of P such that p_i ⋅ x = 0. But x has all positive entries, and p_i is a unit vector. However, the dot product being zero would mean that p_i is orthogonal to x. But since x is in the positive orthant, and p_i is a unit vector, is it possible for p_i to be orthogonal to x?

Yes, it&#x27;s possible. For example, take p_i = (1, -1, 0, ..., 0)/sqrt(2). Then, the dot product with x = (1,1,1,...,1) would be (1 - 1)/sqrt(2) + 0 + ... + 0 = 0. So, even with x having all positive entries, p_i ⋅ x can be zero. Therefore, just having positive entries is not sufficient. But the question is whether there exists some x with all non-zero entries (not necessarily all positive) such that p_i ⋅ x ≠ 0 for all i.

Another approach: Let&#x27;s consider the function f(x) = (Px)_1 * (Px)_2 * ... * (Px)_n * x_1 * x_2 * ... * x_n. We need to find x such that f(x) ≠ 0. Since f is the product of all entries of Px and all entries of x, it&#x27;s a polynomial in the entries of x. The set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the hyperplanes {x_i = 0} and {p_i ⋅ x = 0} for each i. Since we are in R^n, and the zero set of a non-zero polynomial has measure zero, but f is the product of 2n linear terms, which is a non-zero polynomial. Wait, but actually, f(x) is the product of n terms from Px and n terms from x, so total degree 2n. However, the set where f(x) = 0 is the union of the 2n hyperplanes. But since these hyperplanes are all of codimension 1, their union is a closed set with empty interior. Therefore, the complement, where f(x) ≠ 0, is open and dense. Therefore, there exist vectors x where f(x) ≠ 0, which means all entries of x and all entries of Px are non-zero. Hence, such vectors exist.

This again confirms that the answer is yes.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for each row p_i of P, the hyperplane p_i ⋅ x = 0 does not contain any of the coordinate hyperplanes x_j = 0, unless p_i is aligned with some coordinate axis. But since P is orthogonal, if any row p_i were aligned with a coordinate axis, then the corresponding column would also be that axis vector, making P a permutation matrix (possibly with sign changes). But even if P is a permutation matrix with sign changes (i.e., generalized permutation matrix), then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 correspond to x_j = 0 for some j, depending on the permutation and sign. However, in such a case, avoiding those hyperplanes would correspond to avoiding certain coordinate hyperplanes. But if P is a generalized permutation matrix, then Px is just a permutation of x with possible sign changes. Therefore, if we choose x with all entries non-zero, then Px will also have all entries non-zero, since permutation and sign changes don&#x27;t introduce zeros. Therefore, in that case, any x with no zero entries works. 

If P is not a generalized permutation matrix, then the hyperplanes p_i ⋅ x = 0 are not coordinate hyperplanes, so the union of these hyperplanes and the coordinate hyperplanes is a union of 2n distinct hyperplanes (assuming no overlap). However, even if there is overlap, the key point is that the union is a closed set with empty interior, so the complement is open and dense. Therefore, regardless of the orthogonal matrix P, the existence of such an x is guaranteed.

To summarize:

1. The set of vectors x with no zero entries is open and dense.
2. The set of vectors x such that Px has no zero entries is also open and dense.
3. The intersection of these two sets is non-empty due to the Baire Category Theorem.
4. Therefore, there must exist at least one vector x with no zero entries such that Px also has no zero entries.

Therefore, the answer is yes, such a vector x exists for any orthogonal matrix P.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given an orthogonal matrix \( P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \), we need to determine whether there exists a vector \( x \in \mathbb{R}^n \) with no zero entries such that \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

1. **Orthogonal Matrix Properties**: An orthogonal matrix \( P \) has orthonormal rows and columns, meaning \( P^T P = I \). This implies that the rows of \( P \) form an orthonormal basis for \( \mathbb{R}^n \).

2. **Hyperplanes Consideration**: We need a vector \( x \) such that both \( x \) and \( Px \) have no zero entries. This translates to finding \( x \) such that \( x \) is not orthogonal to any row of \( P \), i.e., \( p_i \cdot x \neq 0 \) for all rows \( p_i \) of \( P \).

3. **Dense Sets Argument**: 
   - The set of vectors with no zero entries (complement of coordinate hyperplanes) is open and dense in \( \mathbb{R}^n \).
   - The set of vectors \( x \) such that \( Px \) has no zero entries (complement of hyperplanes orthogonal to rows of \( P \)) is also open and dense.

4. **Intersection of Dense Sets**: By the Baire Category Theorem, the intersection of two open dense sets in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) is non-empty. Therefore, there exists a vector \( x \) that lies in both sets, meaning \( x \) has no zero entries and \( Px \) also has no zero entries.

5. **Conclusion**: The existence of such a vector \( x \) is guaranteed by the density and openness arguments, confirming that the required vector exists for any orthogonal matrix \( P \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out which of the statements (a), (b), (c), or (d) is true given that the polynomial f(x) = x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d has a derivative f’(x) with three distinct real roots. Let me start by recalling some calculus and polynomial theory.

First, since f(x) is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, its derivative f’(x) is a cubic (degree 3) polynomial. The problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. That means the derivative has three distinct critical points where the slope of f(x) is zero. For a cubic polynomial to have three distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive, but I might not need to compute that here. The key takeaway is that the original function f(x) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum, or two local maxima and one local minimum. Since the derivative is a cubic with three real roots, it must alternate between increasing and decreasing appropriately.

Now, the graph of a quartic polynomial typically has a &quot;W&quot; shape or an &quot;M&quot; shape depending on the leading coefficient. Since the leading term here is x⁴, which has a positive coefficient, as x approaches positive or negative infinity, f(x) tends to positive infinity. Therefore, the graph will eventually rise on both ends. Given that the derivative has three real roots, there are three critical points. For a quartic with positive leading coefficient, the typical shape with three critical points would be two local minima and one local maximum in between. So, the graph would go up, then down, then up, then down, then up again? Wait, no. Wait, the derivative is cubic, so it can have three critical points. So the original function f(x) will have three turning points. Since it&#x27;s a quartic, it can have up to three turning points (since the derivative is cubic, which can have up to three roots). So with three critical points, the graph of f(x) will have two local minima and one local maximum, or two maxima and one minima. But given that the leading coefficient is positive, as x approaches ±∞, f(x) goes to +∞. Therefore, the rightmost and leftmost critical points must be minima. So the structure would be: starting from the left, the function decreases to a local maximum, then increases to a local minimum, then decreases again to a local maximum, and then increases to infinity? Wait, that doesn&#x27;t make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if the derivative has three real roots, then the original function f(x) has three critical points. Let me label them as x₁ &lt; x₂ &lt; x₃. Since the leading term is positive, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, and the same as x approaches -infty. So, the rightmost critical point x₃ must be a local minimum (since after that, the function increases to infinity), and the leftmost critical point x₁ must be a local maximum (since coming from -infty, the function is decreasing until x₁, then starts increasing). Wait, no, that seems contradictory. Let me check:

If x approaches -infty, f(x) tends to +infty, so as we move from left to right (from -infty to +infty), the function starts at +infty, then at some point x₁ (the leftmost critical point) it might turn. If x₁ is a local maximum, then after x₁, the function decreases. Then, at x₂, another critical point, which would have to be a local minimum, so after x₂, the function increases again. Then at x₃, another critical point, which would be a local maximum, and then after x₃, the function decreases. But wait, but after x₃, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, which is a contradiction because if x₃ is a local maximum, then after x₃, the function should decrease, but it actually needs to increase to +infty. Therefore, that can&#x27;t be. Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the leftmost critical point x₁ is a local minimum. Let&#x27;s see: starting from -infty, f(x) is going to +infty. Then at x₁, which is a local minimum, the function starts increasing. Then at x₂, a local maximum, so after x₂, the function decreases. Then at x₃, another local minimum, so after x₃, the function increases again towards +infty. That makes sense. So the critical points are arranged as local minimum at x₁, local maximum at x₂, local minimum at x₃. Therefore, the graph has two local minima and one local maximum.

So the function f(x) would start at +infty, decrease to a local minimum at x₁, then increase to a local maximum at x₂, then decrease to a local minimum at x₃, and then increase again to +infty. So, the graph would look like a &quot;W&quot; but with the middle peak being a local maximum and the two valleys being local minima. So, the function has two local minima and one local maximum.

Given that structure, let&#x27;s consider the possible number of real roots for f(x) = k. Depending on the value of k, the horizontal line y = k can intersect the graph of f(x) in different ways.

If k is greater than the value of the local maximum at x₂, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃, because the function only exceeds k on the far left and far right.

If k is exactly equal to the value of the local maximum at x₂, then f(x) = k would have three real roots: one at x₂ (with multiplicity two, since it&#x27;s a local maximum) and one on each side (left of x₁ and right of x₃). But wait, if the local maximum is exactly at k, then the graph touches the line y = k at x₂, so that&#x27;s a double root, and crosses the line on either side. So three real roots, but one of them is a double root.

If k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two local minima, then suppose the local minima at x₁ and x₃ have values m₁ and m₃. Let&#x27;s assume that one of the minima is lower than the other. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, both minima must be below the local maximum. However, depending on the specific coefficients, one minimum could be lower than the other. Let&#x27;s say, without loss of generality, that m₁ &lt; m₃ (the left local minimum is lower than the right local minimum). Then, if k is between m₃ and the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots: two on the left side (between -infty and x₁, and between x₁ and x₂), and two on the right side (between x₂ and x₃, and between x₃ and +infty). Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two minima, say between M and m₃ (assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), then when k is in (m₃, M), the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. But actually, when you have two minima and one maximum, the graph goes from +infty to m₁ (local min), rises to M (local max), then falls to m₃ (local min), then rises again to +infty. So if k is between m₁ and M, then depending on where k is relative to m₃, the number of roots changes.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch a rough graph mentally. Starting from the left (x approaching -infty), f(x) is at +infty, decreases to m₁ at x₁ (local min), then increases to M at x₂ (local max), then decreases to m₃ at x₃ (local min), then increases back to +infty.

So, if k is greater than M, then the equation f(x) = k has two real roots: one on the far left and one on the far right.

If k is equal to M, then it has three real roots: one at x₂ (a double root) and one on each side.

If k is between m₃ and M, then it has four real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, one between x₂ and x₃, and one right of x₃.

If k is equal to m₃, then it has three real roots: one at x₃ (double root) and one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂.

If k is between m₁ and m₃, then it has two real roots: one left of x₁ and one right of x₃, because the horizontal line y = k only intersects the graph on the leftmost and rightmost ascending parts. Wait, but between x₁ and x₃, the function reaches a maximum at x₂, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, then the line y = k would cross the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. Wait, but if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the minima, but since m₁ is lower than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ to M, so it must cross y = k once there. Similarly, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then since m₃ is higher than m₁, and k is between m₁ and m₃, then on the interval x₂ to x₃, the function decreases from M to m₃, crossing y = k once. Similarly, on the interval x₃ to +infty, the function increases from m₃ to +infty, so y = k would cross once there. Similarly, on the interval -infty to x₁, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, crossing y = k once. Therefore, actually, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots. If k is equal to m₁, then it&#x27;s a double root at x₁ and another root on the right. Similarly, if k is equal to m₃, it&#x27;s a double root at x₃ and another root on the left. If k is less than m₁, since m₁ is the lower of the two minima, then the line y = k would intersect the graph only twice: once left of x₁ and once right of x₃. Wait, no. If k is less than m₁, which is the minimum, then the graph only reaches down to m₁, so y = k would not intersect the graph at all? Wait, no. Wait, as x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches +infty, and at x₁, it&#x27;s a local minimum m₁. So if k &lt; m₁, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃? Wait, but if k is less than m₁, which is the minimum value on the left side, then on the left side, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, so it must cross y = k once. On the right side, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is higher than m₁) up to +infty, so if k is less than m₁, then since m₃ is greater than m₁, and k is less than m₁, then on the right side, the function starts at m₃ (which is greater than k) and increases to infinity, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, if k &lt; m₁, there is only one real root on the left side. Similarly, if k &gt; M, there are two real roots on the extremes. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to tabulate the different cases.

Let me denote:

- The leftmost local minimum at x = x₁ with f(x₁) = m₁.

- The local maximum at x = x₂ with f(x₂) = M.

- The rightmost local minimum at x = x₃ with f(x₃) = m₃.

Assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ (since x₁ &lt; x₃ and the function might have asymmetrical minima), though it could also be m₃ &lt; m₁. Wait, but since the function is going from m₁ up to M, then down to m₃, and then up again. The relative positions of m₁ and m₃ depend on the specific coefficients. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify, so I can&#x27;t assume which is lower. Therefore, perhaps I need to consider both possibilities. But maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter. Let&#x27;s suppose m₁ ≤ m₃ for definiteness. Then:

- If k &gt; M: two real roots (left and right).

- If k = M: three real roots (one double root at x₂ and two simple roots on the sides).

- If m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots (left, between x₁ and x₂, between x₂ and x₃, right).

- If k = m₃: three real roots (double root at x₃ and two others).

- If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: four real roots (similar to above? Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, but the function between x₁ and x₂ goes up to M, which is higher than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function crosses y = k once (since it goes from m₁ to M), between x₂ and x₃, it crosses once (since it goes from M to m₃), and on both ends, left of x₁ and right of x₃, the function is above k? Wait, no. Wait, the left end (x approaching -infty) is +infty, so coming from the left, the function starts at +infty, decreases to m₁ (which is less than k, since k &gt; m₁), so it must cross y = k once on the left side (before x₁). Then, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross there. Wait, but m₃ is greater than k, so after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so if m₃ &gt; k, then it never crosses y = k again. Therefore, in this case, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k has three real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, and one between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought.

Wait, perhaps I need to more carefully analyze:

Case 1: k &gt; M. Then, the horizontal line y = k cuts the graph at two points: one far left (before x₁) and one far right (after x₃).

Case 2: k = M. The line touches the local maximum at x₂ and cuts the graph on the left and right sides, resulting in three real roots (one double root at x₂).

Case 3: m₃ &lt; k &lt; M. The line y = k intersects the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃.

Wait, but if m₃ is the right local minimum, and k is greater than m₃ but less than M, then after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so since k &gt; m₃, there will be a crossing right of x₃. Similarly, left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is less than k (since k &gt; m₃ and m₃ &gt; m₁, so k &gt; m₁). Therefore, left of x₁, the function crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ (which is less than k) up to M (which is greater than k), so crosses once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is less than k), so crosses once. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to infinity, crossing once. Therefore, four crossings. So that&#x27;s four real roots.

Case 4: k = m₃. The line touches the local minimum at x₃, so it&#x27;s a double root there, and crosses the graph left of x₁ and between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so at k = m₃, it only touches at x₃. Therefore, the roots would be left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂ (since the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing k = m₃ if m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), but wait, m₃ is the value at x₃, which is a local minimum. If k = m₃, then between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so it reaches m₃ at x₃. Therefore, if k = m₃, then there&#x27;s a root at x₃ (double root) and another root left of x₁ (since the function decreases from +infty to m₁, which is less than m₃, so crosses y = m₃ once left of x₁) and another root between x₁ and x₂ (as the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing y = m₃ once). So total of three roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and a double root at x₃.

Case 5: m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃. Here, k is between the two local minima. Since m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum. Let&#x27;s assume m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph as follows:

- Left of x₁: the function comes down from +infty to m₁, which is less than k, so it crosses y = k once.

- Between x₁ and x₂: the function goes from m₁ (less than k) up to M (greater than k), so crosses once.

- Between x₂ and x₃: the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so crosses once.

- Right of x₃: the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = k there.

Therefore, total of three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃.

Wait, but hold on. If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃, then m₃ is greater than k, so right of x₃, the function starts at m₃ and goes up, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, only three real roots? But earlier, when k is between m₃ and M, we had four roots. Hmm.

Case 6: k = m₁. The line touches the left local minimum at x₁, resulting in a double root there. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than m₁), so if k = m₁, which is less than m₃, the function crosses y = k once between x₂ and x₃. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ to +infty, which is above k, so no crossing. Also, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M, so crosses y = k once. Wait, but if k = m₁, then between x₁ and x₂, the function starts at m₁ (k) and goes up, so the crossing is exactly at x₁, which is a double root. Then, another crossing between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, three real roots: double root at x₁ and single roots between x₂ and x₃ and right of x₃? Wait, no. Wait, if k = m₁, then at x₁, the function has a local minimum. So the graph touches y = k at x₁, and then goes up. On the left side, as x approaches -infty, the function approaches +infty, so it comes down from +infty to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, left of x₁, there&#x27;s no crossing since it&#x27;s decreasing to m₁. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root because it&#x27;s a local minimum). Then, moving from x₁ to x₂, the function increases to M, which is greater than m₁, so there&#x27;s no crossing there. Then, from x₂ to x₃, the function decreases to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Then, from x₃ to +infty, the function increases to +infty, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = m₁ again. Therefore, total of two real roots: a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but the original function at x approaching -infty is +infty, so when approaching from the left, the function decreases to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, for k = m₁, the leftmost intersection is exactly at x₁ (a double root), and then another intersection between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, two real roots (one double, one single). But in the context of the problem, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot; or &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, do they count multiplicity? The problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for option (a). If they count multiplicity, then at k = m₁, f(x) = k has two real roots (one double, one single). If they don&#x27;t count multiplicity, then maybe it&#x27;s considered as two real roots (but one is a double root). Wait, the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;. So if multiplicity is considered, then a double root would count as one root, but actually, in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s still one. Wait, no. Wait, multiplicity is about the number of roots counting multiplicity. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, which might mean exactly one distinct real root, or exactly one real root counting multiplicity. The question is ambiguous, but in standard terminology, &quot;exactly one real root&quot; usually refers to exactly one distinct real root, but in some contexts, it might count multiplicity. However, in options (b) and (c), they mention &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; and &quot;four distinct real roots&quot;, so it seems like they are distinguishing between distinct roots and multiple roots. Therefore, for (a), &quot;exactly one real root&quot; probably means exactly one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. Similarly, for (b), &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;. So in the case where k = m₁, we have a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃, so that&#x27;s two distinct real roots (x₁ with multiplicity two and another root). Therefore, (a) is not satisfied here.

Case 7: k &lt; m₁. Then, the horizontal line y = k is below both local minima. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, the line y = k would intersect the graph twice: once on the far left (before x₁) and once on the far right (after x₃). Therefore, two real roots.

So summarizing:

- k &gt; M: two real roots.

- k = M: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots.

- k = m₃: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: three real roots.

- k = m₁: three real roots (one double, two simple? Wait, earlier analysis said two roots, but maybe I messed up).

Wait, let me re-examine k = m₁. If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root) and since between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, total of two distinct real roots: x₁ (double) and one between x₂ and x₃. So, in terms of distinct roots, two; in terms of total roots counting multiplicity, three. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for (a). If &quot;exactly one&quot; means one distinct root, then even if it&#x27;s a double root, that would still be considered one real root. But in standard terminology, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, they usually mean one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. However, in the case of k = M, we have three real roots but one is a double root. The problem&#x27;s option (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, so distinctness is important there. So, for (a), if there exists a k where f(x) = k has exactly one real root (distinct or not?), the answer depends on that.

But in the case where k is less than m₁, we have two distinct real roots. If k is equal to m₁, we have two real roots (x₁ is a double root, and another one). If k is between m₁ and m₃, three real roots. If k is equal to m₃ or M, three real roots (with a double root). If k is between m₃ and M, four real roots. If k is greater than M, two real roots.

Wait, but in none of these cases do we have exactly one real root. Even when k is less than m₁, we have two real roots. When k equals m₁ or m₃ or M, we have two or three real roots but with multiplicities. So, there is no k for which f(x) = k has exactly one real root, right? Unless when the polynomial is tangent to the line y = k at one point and doesn&#x27;t cross it elsewhere, but given the shape of the quartic, which tends to +infty on both sides, if the horizontal line is tangent at the local maximum or one of the minima, it will still cross the graph on one side or the other. Wait, for example, if k is equal to the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = M has a double root at x₂ and two other roots on the left and right. Wait, no. Wait, at k = M, the horizontal line touches the local maximum at x₂. To the left of x₂, the function is increasing from m₁ to M, so it only reaches M at x₂. To the right of x₂, the function decreases from M to m₃ and then increases again. Therefore, the line y = M would intersect the graph only at x₂ (a double root) and on the right side as the function increases past M again? Wait, no. Wait, after x₃, the function increases from m₃ to +infty. If M is the local maximum, then m₃ is less than M. So, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is less than M) up to +infty, so it must cross y = M once after x₃. Similarly, to the left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁ (which is less than M), so it must cross y = M once before x₁. Therefore, when k = M, the equation f(x) = M has three real roots: one at x₂ (double root) and one on each side. Therefore, three distinct real roots? Wait, but x₂ is a double root, so in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s three: x₂, and one on each side. So multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect distinctness. Therefore, even though x₂ is a double root, it&#x27;s still one distinct root. So in that case, k = M gives three distinct real roots, with one of them being a double root. Wait, no. If a root is a double root, it&#x27;s still a single distinct root; the distinctness refers to the x-values. So x₂ is one distinct root, and the other two are also distinct. So in total, three distinct real roots, one with multiplicity two. Therefore, for the problem&#x27;s option (b): &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Well, when k = M or k = m₁ or k = m₃, you have three real roots, but with one double root. But the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would require all three roots to be distinct, i.e., no multiple roots. So in that case, even though at k = M you have three real roots, one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. Therefore, the answer would be that statement (b) is false. Wait, but when k is between m₃ and M, we have four distinct real roots. When k is between m₁ and m₃, three distinct real roots. When k is less than m₁ or greater than M, two distinct real roots. When k equals M, m₁, or m₃, three real roots with one double root.

Therefore, the statement (b) says: &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Given that when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three distinct real roots (as per the earlier analysis). Wait, earlier I thought when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three real roots. Wait, let&#x27;s recheck.

Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two local minima, then depending on the graph, how does the horizontal line intersect? Suppose m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum, with m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, k between m₁ and m₃ would be above m₁ and below m₃. Then, on the left side (x &lt; x₁), the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is below k, so it crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is above k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross. Therefore, three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots because they are in different intervals. Therefore, statement (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima, we get three distinct real roots. Additionally, if m₁ &gt; m₃, then similar logic applies, just switch left and right.

Therefore, regardless of the relative positions of the minima, there exists a k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Therefore, option (b) is true.

But wait, the answer options are (a), (b), (c), (d). Let&#x27;s check the options again:

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

From the analysis above:

- (a) is false because for any real k, f(x) = k has either two, three, or four real roots. There is no k where it has exactly one real root.

- (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima (or between the higher local minimum and the local maximum, but actually in our case, between m₁ and m₃, assuming m₁ &lt; m₃), the equation f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

Wait, earlier, when k is between m₁ and m₃, which are both minima, the horizontal line y = k intersects the graph three times: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots.

- (c) is false because when k is greater than M or less than m₁ (the lower of the two minima), f(x) = k has only two real roots.

- (d) is false because when k is between the two local minima or between a local minimum and the local maximum, f(x) = k has four or three real roots, respectively, so not always two real and two complex roots.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

But wait, the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, and the options are (a)-(d). The analysis above suggests that (b) is true. However, in the initial problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots. Wait, but in our analysis, we concluded that between the two local minima, we can get three real roots. But the key is that the quartic has three critical points: two minima and one maximum or two maxima and one minima, but in this case, with leading coefficient positive, it&#x27;s two minima and one maximum.

But let me verify with an example. Take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x + 1. Wait, maybe a simpler example. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 2x³ - 3x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 6x² - 6x. Let&#x27;s find the critical points.

Wait, maybe a better example is f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has three real roots: x = 0, x = sqrt(2), x = -sqrt(2). So the critical points are at x = -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). Then f(x) at these points: f(-sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(2))⁴ - 4*(sqrt(2))² = 4 - 8 = -4. f(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. f(sqrt(2)) = same as f(-sqrt(2)) = -4. So the local minima are at x = ±sqrt(2) with f(x) = -4, and the local maximum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0. So this is a symmetric quartic. Then, for k between -4 and 0, f(x) = k has four real roots. For k = 0, it has three real roots (double root at x = 0 and two at ±sqrt(something)). For k &lt; -4, two real roots. For k &gt; 0, two real roots. For k between the minima and the maximum (i.e., between -4 and 0), four real roots. For k exactly at -4, three real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). Wait, but in this case, the two minima are equal. So here, m₁ = m₃ = -4. Therefore, there is no interval between m₁ and m₃; they are the same. Therefore, in this symmetric case, when k is between -4 and 0, you get four real roots, but when k is exactly -4, you get two real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). However, the original problem states that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does: -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). So in this case, the two minima are equal. Therefore, if the two local minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are equal), so the three real roots case doesn&#x27;t occur. Wait, but the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; for f’(x). In this example, f’(x) has three distinct real roots. But in this case, the minima are equal, so between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, you get four real roots. But if the minima are not equal, then between them, you would have three real roots.

Therefore, the key is whether the two local minima can be at different heights. If f’(x) has three distinct real roots, but the function f(x) could still have two equal minima. Wait, but in the example above, even with symmetric critical points, the minima are equal. So perhaps, depending on the coefficients, the minima can be equal or not. Therefore, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether the minima are equal or not, only that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Therefore, in some cases, you might have equal minima, in others not. Therefore, the answer would depend on whether, regardless of the specific f(x) meeting the condition, statement (b) is always true.

But wait, in the example where minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are the same), so the three real roots case would not exist. However, in that case, when k is between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, which is the same as saying between m and M, you get four real roots. When k is less than m or greater than M, you get two real roots. When k equals m, you get two double roots. When k equals M, you get three real roots (a double root and two simple roots). Therefore, in the symmetric case, statement (b) is false because there is no k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. When k = M, you have three real roots but one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. When k is between m and M, you have four distinct real roots. When k is less than m, two distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric case, statement (b) is false. But the problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does, but the minima are equal. Therefore, the correct answer would not always be (b). Therefore, my previous analysis was incorrect.

Therefore, there&#x27;s a problem: if the quartic is symmetric, with two equal minima, then there is no k for which f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) would not hold in such cases. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot; given that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Since there exist such polynomials where statement (b) is false, but there also exist polynomials where statement (b) is true. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the statement must hold for all such polynomials or if there exists at least one. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, implying that the statement must be always true given the conditions.

Therefore, since there exists a polynomial where f’(x) has three distinct real roots but there&#x27;s no k with three distinct real roots (like the symmetric quartic example), statement (b) is not always true. Therefore, my previous conclusion was wrong.

Then, what is the correct answer? Let&#x27;s re-examine the options.

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

In the symmetric example, the only possible numbers of real roots are two (k &lt; m), four (m &lt; k &lt; M), three (k = m or k = M), or two (k &gt; M). So in this case, there is no k with exactly one real root. Therefore, statement (a) is false.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric example, when k = m or k = M, we have three real roots but with a double root, so they are not distinct. Therefore, in this case, there is no k with three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) is false.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

False, since for k &gt; M or k &lt; m, there are only two real roots.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

False, since for some k, there are four real roots.

Therefore, in this case, none of the options are true? But that can&#x27;t be, because the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the symmetric example. Let&#x27;s take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has roots at x = 0, sqrt(2), -sqrt(2). So three distinct real roots. The function f(x) = x⁴ - 4x² has local maxima at x = 0 (f(0) = 0) and local minima at x = ±sqrt(2) (f(±sqrt(2)) = -4). Then, for k = -4, the equation f(x) = -4 has double roots at x = ±sqrt(2). For k = 0, it has a double root at x = 0 and simple roots at x = ±2. So, in this case, when k = 0, the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. Therefore, three real roots, but only two distinct ones (x = 0 and x = ±2). Wait, no. If x = ±2 are roots, then total roots are x = 0 (double), x = 2, and x = -2. So four roots total, but with x = 0 counted twice. However, the equation x⁴ - 4x² = 0 factors as x²(x² - 4) = 0, so roots at x = 0 (multiplicity 2), x = 2, x = -2. So in this case, for k = 0, there are three distinct real roots (0, 2, -2), with one of them being a double root. Therefore, in terms of distinct real roots, it&#x27;s three. So, statement (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would be true here because even though 0 is a double root, the roots are still distinct: -2, 0, 2. So in this case, k = 0 gives three distinct real roots, even with a double root at 0. Therefore, perhaps in this example, statement (b) is true.

Wait, but if we take k = -4, then f(x) = -4 has roots at x = ±sqrt(2), each with multiplicity two. So, two distinct real roots, each a double root. Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is not satisfied for k = -4, but for k = 0, we have three distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric example, there does exist a k (specifically k = 0) such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) is true.

But earlier, I thought that when the minima are equal, there&#x27;s no k between them, but in reality, even in the symmetric case, there is a k (the local maximum) where you have three distinct real roots. So regardless of whether the minima are equal or not, the local maximum will always provide a k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Let me check.

In the symmetric example, at k = 0 (the local maximum), the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double root) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) holds.

If we take another example where the minima are not equal. Let’s construct a quartic with two unequal minima. For example, f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x. Compute its derivative: f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x² + 4x + 4. I need to check if this derivative has three distinct real roots. Instead of computing, maybe take a known quartic. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 6x² + 4x. Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x + 4. Let&#x27;s check the roots of f’(x). Maybe this cubic has three real roots. Alternatively, use f(x) = x⁴ - 3x³ - 3x² + 4x + 1. Not sure. Alternatively, take f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4), but that would have four real roots, but its derivative would have three critical points. However, expanding this would be time-consuming.

Alternatively, take a quartic with two minima at different heights. Suppose f(x) has a local minimum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0, a local maximum at x = 1 with f(1) = 2, and another local minimum at x = 2 with f(2) = 1. Then, the function would go from +infty down to 0 at x = 0, up to 2 at x = 1, down to 1 at x = 2, and back up to +infty. In this case, m₁ = 0, M = 2, m₃ = 1. Then, for k between m₁ = 0 and m₃ = 1, the equation f(x) = k would have three distinct real roots: one left of 0, one between 0 and 1, and one between 1 and 2. For k between m₃ = 1 and M = 2, four distinct real roots. For k = 1, three real roots (double root at x = 2 and two others). For k = 0, three real roots (double root at x = 0 and one other). For k = 2, three real roots (double root at x = 1 and two others). For k &lt; 0, two real roots; for k &gt; 2, two real roots.

Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k between 0 and 1 (the two minima) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric case, even though the minima are equal, there&#x27;s still a k = M where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots (with a double root at the local maximum). Wait, no. In the symmetric case, k = M is the local maximum. For example, in f(x) = x⁴ - 4x², the local maximum is at x = 0 with k = 0. The equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, even in the symmetric case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k (specifically k = M) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Even though one of them is a double root, but the roots are still distinct in terms of their x-values. Wait, no. A double root at x = 0 means that x = 0 is a repeated root, but the distinct roots are x = -2, x = 0, x = 2. Therefore, three distinct real roots. The multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect the distinctness. Therefore, even if there is a multiple root, as long as there are three separate x-values, it&#x27;s three distinct real roots. Therefore, in both symmetric and asymmetric cases, statement (b) holds.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) with real coefficients, we know that its derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) has three distinct real roots. This implies that \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum (since the leading coefficient is positive, the polynomial tends to \( +\infty \) as \( x \to \pm\infty \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Critical Points and Graph Shape**:
   - The polynomial \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum.
   - The graph of \( f(x) \) will have a &quot;W&quot; shape with two local minima and one local maximum.

2. **Behavior of \( f(x) = k \)**:
   - For \( k \) values greater than the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local maximum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the local maximum and the higher local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has four real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to either local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local minimum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the two local minima, \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - For \( k \) values less than the lower local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.

3. **Evaluation of Statements**:
   - **(a)** False: There is no \( k \) such that \( f(x) = k \) has exactly one real root.
   - **(b)** True: There exists a \( k \) (between the two local minima) where \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - **(c)** False: \( f(x) = k \) does not always have four distinct real roots (e.g., for \( k \) outside the range between the local minima and maximum).
   - **(d)** False: \( f(x) = k \) can have four real roots for some \( k \), so it does not always have two real and two complex roots.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out which of the statements (a), (b), (c), or (d) is true given that the polynomial f(x) = x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d has a derivative f’(x) with three distinct real roots. Let me start by recalling some calculus and polynomial theory.

First, since f(x) is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, its derivative f’(x) is a cubic (degree 3) polynomial. The problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. That means the derivative has three distinct critical points where the slope of f(x) is zero. For a cubic polynomial to have three distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive, but I might not need to compute that here. The key takeaway is that the original function f(x) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum, or two local maxima and one local minimum. Since the derivative is a cubic with three real roots, it must alternate between increasing and decreasing appropriately.

Now, the graph of a quartic polynomial typically has a &quot;W&quot; shape or an &quot;M&quot; shape depending on the leading coefficient. Since the leading term here is x⁴, which has a positive coefficient, as x approaches positive or negative infinity, f(x) tends to positive infinity. Therefore, the graph will eventually rise on both ends. Given that the derivative has three real roots, there are three critical points. For a quartic with positive leading coefficient, the typical shape with three critical points would be two local minima and one local maximum in between. So, the graph would go up, then down, then up, then down, then up again? Wait, no. Wait, the derivative is cubic, so it can have three critical points. So the original function f(x) will have three turning points. Since it&#x27;s a quartic, it can have up to three turning points (since the derivative is cubic, which can have up to three roots). So with three critical points, the graph of f(x) will have two local minima and one local maximum, or two maxima and one minima. But given that the leading coefficient is positive, as x approaches ±∞, f(x) goes to +∞. Therefore, the rightmost and leftmost critical points must be minima. So the structure would be: starting from the left, the function decreases to a local maximum, then increases to a local minimum, then decreases again to a local maximum, and then increases to infinity? Wait, that doesn&#x27;t make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if the derivative has three real roots, then the original function f(x) has three critical points. Let me label them as x₁ &lt; x₂ &lt; x₃. Since the leading term is positive, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, and the same as x approaches -infty. So, the rightmost critical point x₃ must be a local minimum (since after that, the function increases to infinity), and the leftmost critical point x₁ must be a local maximum (since coming from -infty, the function is decreasing until x₁, then starts increasing). Wait, no, that seems contradictory. Let me check:

If x approaches -infty, f(x) tends to +infty, so as we move from left to right (from -infty to +infty), the function starts at +infty, then at some point x₁ (the leftmost critical point) it might turn. If x₁ is a local maximum, then after x₁, the function decreases. Then, at x₂, another critical point, which would have to be a local minimum, so after x₂, the function increases again. Then at x₃, another critical point, which would be a local maximum, and then after x₃, the function decreases. But wait, but after x₃, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, which is a contradiction because if x₃ is a local maximum, then after x₃, the function should decrease, but it actually needs to increase to +infty. Therefore, that can&#x27;t be. Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the leftmost critical point x₁ is a local minimum. Let&#x27;s see: starting from -infty, f(x) is going to +infty. Then at x₁, which is a local minimum, the function starts increasing. Then at x₂, a local maximum, so after x₂, the function decreases. Then at x₃, another local minimum, so after x₃, the function increases again towards +infty. That makes sense. So the critical points are arranged as local minimum at x₁, local maximum at x₂, local minimum at x₃. Therefore, the graph has two local minima and one local maximum.

So the function f(x) would start at +infty, decrease to a local minimum at x₁, then increase to a local maximum at x₂, then decrease to a local minimum at x₃, and then increase again to +infty. So, the graph would look like a &quot;W&quot; but with the middle peak being a local maximum and the two valleys being local minima. So, the function has two local minima and one local maximum.

Given that structure, let&#x27;s consider the possible number of real roots for f(x) = k. Depending on the value of k, the horizontal line y = k can intersect the graph of f(x) in different ways.

If k is greater than the value of the local maximum at x₂, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃, because the function only exceeds k on the far left and far right.

If k is exactly equal to the value of the local maximum at x₂, then f(x) = k would have three real roots: one at x₂ (with multiplicity two, since it&#x27;s a local maximum) and one on each side (left of x₁ and right of x₃). But wait, if the local maximum is exactly at k, then the graph touches the line y = k at x₂, so that&#x27;s a double root, and crosses the line on either side. So three real roots, but one of them is a double root.

If k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two local minima, then suppose the local minima at x₁ and x₃ have values m₁ and m₃. Let&#x27;s assume that one of the minima is lower than the other. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, both minima must be below the local maximum. However, depending on the specific coefficients, one minimum could be lower than the other. Let&#x27;s say, without loss of generality, that m₁ &lt; m₃ (the left local minimum is lower than the right local minimum). Then, if k is between m₃ and the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots: two on the left side (between -infty and x₁, and between x₁ and x₂), and two on the right side (between x₂ and x₃, and between x₃ and +infty). Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two minima, say between M and m₃ (assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), then when k is in (m₃, M), the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. But actually, when you have two minima and one maximum, the graph goes from +infty to m₁ (local min), rises to M (local max), then falls to m₃ (local min), then rises again to +infty. So if k is between m₁ and M, then depending on where k is relative to m₃, the number of roots changes.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch a rough graph mentally. Starting from the left (x approaching -infty), f(x) is at +infty, decreases to m₁ at x₁ (local min), then increases to M at x₂ (local max), then decreases to m₃ at x₃ (local min), then increases back to +infty.

So, if k is greater than M, then the equation f(x) = k has two real roots: one on the far left and one on the far right.

If k is equal to M, then it has three real roots: one at x₂ (a double root) and one on each side.

If k is between m₃ and M, then it has four real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, one between x₂ and x₃, and one right of x₃.

If k is equal to m₃, then it has three real roots: one at x₃ (double root) and one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂.

If k is between m₁ and m₃, then it has two real roots: one left of x₁ and one right of x₃, because the horizontal line y = k only intersects the graph on the leftmost and rightmost ascending parts. Wait, but between x₁ and x₃, the function reaches a maximum at x₂, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, then the line y = k would cross the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. Wait, but if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the minima, but since m₁ is lower than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ to M, so it must cross y = k once there. Similarly, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then since m₃ is higher than m₁, and k is between m₁ and m₃, then on the interval x₂ to x₃, the function decreases from M to m₃, crossing y = k once. Similarly, on the interval x₃ to +infty, the function increases from m₃ to +infty, so y = k would cross once there. Similarly, on the interval -infty to x₁, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, crossing y = k once. Therefore, actually, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots. If k is equal to m₁, then it&#x27;s a double root at x₁ and another root on the right. Similarly, if k is equal to m₃, it&#x27;s a double root at x₃ and another root on the left. If k is less than m₁, since m₁ is the lower of the two minima, then the line y = k would intersect the graph only twice: once left of x₁ and once right of x₃. Wait, no. If k is less than m₁, which is the minimum, then the graph only reaches down to m₁, so y = k would not intersect the graph at all? Wait, no. Wait, as x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches +infty, and at x₁, it&#x27;s a local minimum m₁. So if k &lt; m₁, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃? Wait, but if k is less than m₁, which is the minimum value on the left side, then on the left side, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, so it must cross y = k once. On the right side, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is higher than m₁) up to +infty, so if k is less than m₁, then since m₃ is greater than m₁, and k is less than m₁, then on the right side, the function starts at m₃ (which is greater than k) and increases to infinity, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, if k &lt; m₁, there is only one real root on the left side. Similarly, if k &gt; M, there are two real roots on the extremes. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to tabulate the different cases.

Let me denote:

- The leftmost local minimum at x = x₁ with f(x₁) = m₁.

- The local maximum at x = x₂ with f(x₂) = M.

- The rightmost local minimum at x = x₃ with f(x₃) = m₃.

Assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ (since x₁ &lt; x₃ and the function might have asymmetrical minima), though it could also be m₃ &lt; m₁. Wait, but since the function is going from m₁ up to M, then down to m₃, and then up again. The relative positions of m₁ and m₃ depend on the specific coefficients. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify, so I can&#x27;t assume which is lower. Therefore, perhaps I need to consider both possibilities. But maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter. Let&#x27;s suppose m₁ ≤ m₃ for definiteness. Then:

- If k &gt; M: two real roots (left and right).

- If k = M: three real roots (one double root at x₂ and two simple roots on the sides).

- If m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots (left, between x₁ and x₂, between x₂ and x₃, right).

- If k = m₃: three real roots (double root at x₃ and two others).

- If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: four real roots (similar to above? Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, but the function between x₁ and x₂ goes up to M, which is higher than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function crosses y = k once (since it goes from m₁ to M), between x₂ and x₃, it crosses once (since it goes from M to m₃), and on both ends, left of x₁ and right of x₃, the function is above k? Wait, no. Wait, the left end (x approaching -infty) is +infty, so coming from the left, the function starts at +infty, decreases to m₁ (which is less than k, since k &gt; m₁), so it must cross y = k once on the left side (before x₁). Then, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross there. Wait, but m₃ is greater than k, so after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so if m₃ &gt; k, then it never crosses y = k again. Therefore, in this case, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k has three real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, and one between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought.

Wait, perhaps I need to more carefully analyze:

Case 1: k &gt; M. Then, the horizontal line y = k cuts the graph at two points: one far left (before x₁) and one far right (after x₃).

Case 2: k = M. The line touches the local maximum at x₂ and cuts the graph on the left and right sides, resulting in three real roots (one double root at x₂).

Case 3: m₃ &lt; k &lt; M. The line y = k intersects the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃.

Wait, but if m₃ is the right local minimum, and k is greater than m₃ but less than M, then after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so since k &gt; m₃, there will be a crossing right of x₃. Similarly, left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is less than k (since k &gt; m₃ and m₃ &gt; m₁, so k &gt; m₁). Therefore, left of x₁, the function crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ (which is less than k) up to M (which is greater than k), so crosses once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is less than k), so crosses once. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to infinity, crossing once. Therefore, four crossings. So that&#x27;s four real roots.

Case 4: k = m₃. The line touches the local minimum at x₃, so it&#x27;s a double root there, and crosses the graph left of x₁ and between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so at k = m₃, it only touches at x₃. Therefore, the roots would be left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂ (since the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing k = m₃ if m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), but wait, m₃ is the value at x₃, which is a local minimum. If k = m₃, then between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so it reaches m₃ at x₃. Therefore, if k = m₃, then there&#x27;s a root at x₃ (double root) and another root left of x₁ (since the function decreases from +infty to m₁, which is less than m₃, so crosses y = m₃ once left of x₁) and another root between x₁ and x₂ (as the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing y = m₃ once). So total of three roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and a double root at x₃.

Case 5: m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃. Here, k is between the two local minima. Since m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum. Let&#x27;s assume m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph as follows:

- Left of x₁: the function comes down from +infty to m₁, which is less than k, so it crosses y = k once.

- Between x₁ and x₂: the function goes from m₁ (less than k) up to M (greater than k), so crosses once.

- Between x₂ and x₃: the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so crosses once.

- Right of x₃: the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = k there.

Therefore, total of three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃.

Wait, but hold on. If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃, then m₃ is greater than k, so right of x₃, the function starts at m₃ and goes up, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, only three real roots? But earlier, when k is between m₃ and M, we had four roots. Hmm.

Case 6: k = m₁. The line touches the left local minimum at x₁, resulting in a double root there. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than m₁), so if k = m₁, which is less than m₃, the function crosses y = k once between x₂ and x₃. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ to +infty, which is above k, so no crossing. Also, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M, so crosses y = k once. Wait, but if k = m₁, then between x₁ and x₂, the function starts at m₁ (k) and goes up, so the crossing is exactly at x₁, which is a double root. Then, another crossing between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, three real roots: double root at x₁ and single roots between x₂ and x₃ and right of x₃? Wait, no. Wait, if k = m₁, then at x₁, the function has a local minimum. So the graph touches y = k at x₁, and then goes up. On the left side, as x approaches -infty, the function approaches +infty, so it comes down from +infty to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, left of x₁, there&#x27;s no crossing since it&#x27;s decreasing to m₁. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root because it&#x27;s a local minimum). Then, moving from x₁ to x₂, the function increases to M, which is greater than m₁, so there&#x27;s no crossing there. Then, from x₂ to x₃, the function decreases to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Then, from x₃ to +infty, the function increases to +infty, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = m₁ again. Therefore, total of two real roots: a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but the original function at x approaching -infty is +infty, so when approaching from the left, the function decreases to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, for k = m₁, the leftmost intersection is exactly at x₁ (a double root), and then another intersection between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, two real roots (one double, one single). But in the context of the problem, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot; or &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, do they count multiplicity? The problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for option (a). If they count multiplicity, then at k = m₁, f(x) = k has two real roots (one double, one single). If they don&#x27;t count multiplicity, then maybe it&#x27;s considered as two real roots (but one is a double root). Wait, the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;. So if multiplicity is considered, then a double root would count as one root, but actually, in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s still one. Wait, no. Wait, multiplicity is about the number of roots counting multiplicity. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, which might mean exactly one distinct real root, or exactly one real root counting multiplicity. The question is ambiguous, but in standard terminology, &quot;exactly one real root&quot; usually refers to exactly one distinct real root, but in some contexts, it might count multiplicity. However, in options (b) and (c), they mention &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; and &quot;four distinct real roots&quot;, so it seems like they are distinguishing between distinct roots and multiple roots. Therefore, for (a), &quot;exactly one real root&quot; probably means exactly one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. Similarly, for (b), &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;. So in the case where k = m₁, we have a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃, so that&#x27;s two distinct real roots (x₁ with multiplicity two and another root). Therefore, (a) is not satisfied here.

Case 7: k &lt; m₁. Then, the horizontal line y = k is below both local minima. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, the line y = k would intersect the graph twice: once on the far left (before x₁) and once on the far right (after x₃). Therefore, two real roots.

So summarizing:

- k &gt; M: two real roots.

- k = M: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots.

- k = m₃: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: three real roots.

- k = m₁: three real roots (one double, two simple? Wait, earlier analysis said two roots, but maybe I messed up).

Wait, let me re-examine k = m₁. If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root) and since between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, total of two distinct real roots: x₁ (double) and one between x₂ and x₃. So, in terms of distinct roots, two; in terms of total roots counting multiplicity, three. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for (a). If &quot;exactly one&quot; means one distinct root, then even if it&#x27;s a double root, that would still be considered one real root. But in standard terminology, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, they usually mean one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. However, in the case of k = M, we have three real roots but one is a double root. The problem&#x27;s option (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, so distinctness is important there. So, for (a), if there exists a k where f(x) = k has exactly one real root (distinct or not?), the answer depends on that.

But in the case where k is less than m₁, we have two distinct real roots. If k is equal to m₁, we have two real roots (x₁ is a double root, and another one). If k is between m₁ and m₃, three real roots. If k is equal to m₃ or M, three real roots (with a double root). If k is between m₃ and M, four real roots. If k is greater than M, two real roots.

Wait, but in none of these cases do we have exactly one real root. Even when k is less than m₁, we have two real roots. When k equals m₁ or m₃ or M, we have two or three real roots but with multiplicities. So, there is no k for which f(x) = k has exactly one real root, right? Unless when the polynomial is tangent to the line y = k at one point and doesn&#x27;t cross it elsewhere, but given the shape of the quartic, which tends to +infty on both sides, if the horizontal line is tangent at the local maximum or one of the minima, it will still cross the graph on one side or the other. Wait, for example, if k is equal to the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = M has a double root at x₂ and two other roots on the left and right. Wait, no. Wait, at k = M, the horizontal line touches the local maximum at x₂. To the left of x₂, the function is increasing from m₁ to M, so it only reaches M at x₂. To the right of x₂, the function decreases from M to m₃ and then increases again. Therefore, the line y = M would intersect the graph only at x₂ (a double root) and on the right side as the function increases past M again? Wait, no. Wait, after x₃, the function increases from m₃ to +infty. If M is the local maximum, then m₃ is less than M. So, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is less than M) up to +infty, so it must cross y = M once after x₃. Similarly, to the left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁ (which is less than M), so it must cross y = M once before x₁. Therefore, when k = M, the equation f(x) = M has three real roots: one at x₂ (double root) and one on each side. Therefore, three distinct real roots? Wait, but x₂ is a double root, so in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s three: x₂, and one on each side. So multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect distinctness. Therefore, even though x₂ is a double root, it&#x27;s still one distinct root. So in that case, k = M gives three distinct real roots, with one of them being a double root. Wait, no. If a root is a double root, it&#x27;s still a single distinct root; the distinctness refers to the x-values. So x₂ is one distinct root, and the other two are also distinct. So in total, three distinct real roots, one with multiplicity two. Therefore, for the problem&#x27;s option (b): &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Well, when k = M or k = m₁ or k = m₃, you have three real roots, but with one double root. But the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would require all three roots to be distinct, i.e., no multiple roots. So in that case, even though at k = M you have three real roots, one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. Therefore, the answer would be that statement (b) is false. Wait, but when k is between m₃ and M, we have four distinct real roots. When k is between m₁ and m₃, three distinct real roots. When k is less than m₁ or greater than M, two distinct real roots. When k equals M, m₁, or m₃, three real roots with one double root.

Therefore, the statement (b) says: &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Given that when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three distinct real roots (as per the earlier analysis). Wait, earlier I thought when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three real roots. Wait, let&#x27;s recheck.

Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two local minima, then depending on the graph, how does the horizontal line intersect? Suppose m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum, with m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, k between m₁ and m₃ would be above m₁ and below m₃. Then, on the left side (x &lt; x₁), the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is below k, so it crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is above k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross. Therefore, three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots because they are in different intervals. Therefore, statement (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima, we get three distinct real roots. Additionally, if m₁ &gt; m₃, then similar logic applies, just switch left and right.

Therefore, regardless of the relative positions of the minima, there exists a k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Therefore, option (b) is true.

But wait, the answer options are (a), (b), (c), (d). Let&#x27;s check the options again:

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

From the analysis above:

- (a) is false because for any real k, f(x) = k has either two, three, or four real roots. There is no k where it has exactly one real root.

- (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima (or between the higher local minimum and the local maximum, but actually in our case, between m₁ and m₃, assuming m₁ &lt; m₃), the equation f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

Wait, earlier, when k is between m₁ and m₃, which are both minima, the horizontal line y = k intersects the graph three times: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots.

- (c) is false because when k is greater than M or less than m₁ (the lower of the two minima), f(x) = k has only two real roots.

- (d) is false because when k is between the two local minima or between a local minimum and the local maximum, f(x) = k has four or three real roots, respectively, so not always two real and two complex roots.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

But wait, the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, and the options are (a)-(d). The analysis above suggests that (b) is true. However, in the initial problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots. Wait, but in our analysis, we concluded that between the two local minima, we can get three real roots. But the key is that the quartic has three critical points: two minima and one maximum or two maxima and one minima, but in this case, with leading coefficient positive, it&#x27;s two minima and one maximum.

But let me verify with an example. Take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x + 1. Wait, maybe a simpler example. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 2x³ - 3x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 6x² - 6x. Let&#x27;s find the critical points.

Wait, maybe a better example is f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has three real roots: x = 0, x = sqrt(2), x = -sqrt(2). So the critical points are at x = -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). Then f(x) at these points: f(-sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(2))⁴ - 4*(sqrt(2))² = 4 - 8 = -4. f(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. f(sqrt(2)) = same as f(-sqrt(2)) = -4. So the local minima are at x = ±sqrt(2) with f(x) = -4, and the local maximum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0. So this is a symmetric quartic. Then, for k between -4 and 0, f(x) = k has four real roots. For k = 0, it has three real roots (double root at x = 0 and two at ±sqrt(something)). For k &lt; -4, two real roots. For k &gt; 0, two real roots. For k between the minima and the maximum (i.e., between -4 and 0), four real roots. For k exactly at -4, three real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). Wait, but in this case, the two minima are equal. So here, m₁ = m₃ = -4. Therefore, there is no interval between m₁ and m₃; they are the same. Therefore, in this symmetric case, when k is between -4 and 0, you get four real roots, but when k is exactly -4, you get two real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). However, the original problem states that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does: -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). So in this case, the two minima are equal. Therefore, if the two local minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are equal), so the three real roots case doesn&#x27;t occur. Wait, but the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; for f’(x). In this example, f’(x) has three distinct real roots. But in this case, the minima are equal, so between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, you get four real roots. But if the minima are not equal, then between them, you would have three real roots.

Therefore, the key is whether the two local minima can be at different heights. If f’(x) has three distinct real roots, but the function f(x) could still have two equal minima. Wait, but in the example above, even with symmetric critical points, the minima are equal. So perhaps, depending on the coefficients, the minima can be equal or not. Therefore, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether the minima are equal or not, only that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Therefore, in some cases, you might have equal minima, in others not. Therefore, the answer would depend on whether, regardless of the specific f(x) meeting the condition, statement (b) is always true.

But wait, in the example where minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are the same), so the three real roots case would not exist. However, in that case, when k is between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, which is the same as saying between m and M, you get four real roots. When k is less than m or greater than M, you get two real roots. When k equals m, you get two double roots. When k equals M, you get three real roots (a double root and two simple roots). Therefore, in the symmetric case, statement (b) is false because there is no k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. When k = M, you have three real roots but one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. When k is between m and M, you have four distinct real roots. When k is less than m, two distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric case, statement (b) is false. But the problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does, but the minima are equal. Therefore, the correct answer would not always be (b). Therefore, my previous analysis was incorrect.

Therefore, there&#x27;s a problem: if the quartic is symmetric, with two equal minima, then there is no k for which f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) would not hold in such cases. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot; given that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Since there exist such polynomials where statement (b) is false, but there also exist polynomials where statement (b) is true. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the statement must hold for all such polynomials or if there exists at least one. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, implying that the statement must be always true given the conditions.

Therefore, since there exists a polynomial where f’(x) has three distinct real roots but there&#x27;s no k with three distinct real roots (like the symmetric quartic example), statement (b) is not always true. Therefore, my previous conclusion was wrong.

Then, what is the correct answer? Let&#x27;s re-examine the options.

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

In the symmetric example, the only possible numbers of real roots are two (k &lt; m), four (m &lt; k &lt; M), three (k = m or k = M), or two (k &gt; M). So in this case, there is no k with exactly one real root. Therefore, statement (a) is false.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric example, when k = m or k = M, we have three real roots but with a double root, so they are not distinct. Therefore, in this case, there is no k with three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) is false.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

False, since for k &gt; M or k &lt; m, there are only two real roots.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

False, since for some k, there are four real roots.

Therefore, in this case, none of the options are true? But that can&#x27;t be, because the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the symmetric example. Let&#x27;s take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has roots at x = 0, sqrt(2), -sqrt(2). So three distinct real roots. The function f(x) = x⁴ - 4x² has local maxima at x = 0 (f(0) = 0) and local minima at x = ±sqrt(2) (f(±sqrt(2)) = -4). Then, for k = -4, the equation f(x) = -4 has double roots at x = ±sqrt(2). For k = 0, it has a double root at x = 0 and simple roots at x = ±2. So, in this case, when k = 0, the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. Therefore, three real roots, but only two distinct ones (x = 0 and x = ±2). Wait, no. If x = ±2 are roots, then total roots are x = 0 (double), x = 2, and x = -2. So four roots total, but with x = 0 counted twice. However, the equation x⁴ - 4x² = 0 factors as x²(x² - 4) = 0, so roots at x = 0 (multiplicity 2), x = 2, x = -2. So in this case, for k = 0, there are three distinct real roots (0, 2, -2), with one of them being a double root. Therefore, in terms of distinct real roots, it&#x27;s three. So, statement (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would be true here because even though 0 is a double root, the roots are still distinct: -2, 0, 2. So in this case, k = 0 gives three distinct real roots, even with a double root at 0. Therefore, perhaps in this example, statement (b) is true.

Wait, but if we take k = -4, then f(x) = -4 has roots at x = ±sqrt(2), each with multiplicity two. So, two distinct real roots, each a double root. Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is not satisfied for k = -4, but for k = 0, we have three distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric example, there does exist a k (specifically k = 0) such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) is true.

But earlier, I thought that when the minima are equal, there&#x27;s no k between them, but in reality, even in the symmetric case, there is a k (the local maximum) where you have three distinct real roots. So regardless of whether the minima are equal or not, the local maximum will always provide a k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Let me check.

In the symmetric example, at k = 0 (the local maximum), the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double root) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) holds.

If we take another example where the minima are not equal. Let’s construct a quartic with two unequal minima. For example, f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x. Compute its derivative: f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x² + 4x + 4. I need to check if this derivative has three distinct real roots. Instead of computing, maybe take a known quartic. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 6x² + 4x. Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x + 4. Let&#x27;s check the roots of f’(x). Maybe this cubic has three real roots. Alternatively, use f(x) = x⁴ - 3x³ - 3x² + 4x + 1. Not sure. Alternatively, take f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4), but that would have four real roots, but its derivative would have three critical points. However, expanding this would be time-consuming.

Alternatively, take a quartic with two minima at different heights. Suppose f(x) has a local minimum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0, a local maximum at x = 1 with f(1) = 2, and another local minimum at x = 2 with f(2) = 1. Then, the function would go from +infty down to 0 at x = 0, up to 2 at x = 1, down to 1 at x = 2, and back up to +infty. In this case, m₁ = 0, M = 2, m₃ = 1. Then, for k between m₁ = 0 and m₃ = 1, the equation f(x) = k would have three distinct real roots: one left of 0, one between 0 and 1, and one between 1 and 2. For k between m₃ = 1 and M = 2, four distinct real roots. For k = 1, three real roots (double root at x = 2 and two others). For k = 0, three real roots (double root at x = 0 and one other). For k = 2, three real roots (double root at x = 1 and two others). For k &lt; 0, two real roots; for k &gt; 2, two real roots.

Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k between 0 and 1 (the two minima) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric case, even though the minima are equal, there&#x27;s still a k = M where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots (with a double root at the local maximum). Wait, no. In the symmetric case, k = M is the local maximum. For example, in f(x) = x⁴ - 4x², the local maximum is at x = 0 with k = 0. The equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, even in the symmetric case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k (specifically k = M) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Even though one of them is a double root, but the roots are still distinct in terms of their x-values. Wait, no. A double root at x = 0 means that x = 0 is a repeated root, but the distinct roots are x = -2, x = 0, x = 2. Therefore, three distinct real roots. The multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect the distinctness. Therefore, even if there is a multiple root, as long as there are three separate x-values, it&#x27;s three distinct real roots. Therefore, in both symmetric and asymmetric cases, statement (b) holds.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) with real coefficients, we know that its derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) has three distinct real roots. This implies that \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum (since the leading coefficient is positive, the polynomial tends to \( +\infty \) as \( x \to \pm\infty \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Critical Points and Graph Shape**:
   - The polynomial \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum.
   - The graph of \( f(x) \) will have a &quot;W&quot; shape with two local minima and one local maximum.

2. **Behavior of \( f(x) = k \)**:
   - For \( k \) values greater than the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local maximum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the local maximum and the higher local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has four real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to either local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local minimum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the two local minima, \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - For \( k \) values less than the lower local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.

3. **Evaluation of Statements**:
   - **(a)** False: There is no \( k \) such that \( f(x) = k \) has exactly one real root.
   - **(b)** True: There exists a \( k \) (between the two local minima) where \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - **(c)** False: \( f(x) = k \) does not always have four distinct real roots (e.g., for \( k \) outside the range between the local minima and maximum).
   - **(d)** False: \( f(x) = k \) can have four real roots for some \( k \), so it does not always have two real and two complex roots.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out which of the statements (a), (b), (c), or (d) is true given that the polynomial f(x) = x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d has a derivative f’(x) with three distinct real roots. Let me start by recalling some calculus and polynomial theory.

First, since f(x) is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, its derivative f’(x) is a cubic (degree 3) polynomial. The problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. That means the derivative has three distinct critical points where the slope of f(x) is zero. For a cubic polynomial to have three distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive, but I might not need to compute that here. The key takeaway is that the original function f(x) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum, or two local maxima and one local minimum. Since the derivative is a cubic with three real roots, it must alternate between increasing and decreasing appropriately.

Now, the graph of a quartic polynomial typically has a &quot;W&quot; shape or an &quot;M&quot; shape depending on the leading coefficient. Since the leading term here is x⁴, which has a positive coefficient, as x approaches positive or negative infinity, f(x) tends to positive infinity. Therefore, the graph will eventually rise on both ends. Given that the derivative has three real roots, there are three critical points. For a quartic with positive leading coefficient, the typical shape with three critical points would be two local minima and one local maximum in between. So, the graph would go up, then down, then up, then down, then up again? Wait, no. Wait, the derivative is cubic, so it can have three critical points. So the original function f(x) will have three turning points. Since it&#x27;s a quartic, it can have up to three turning points (since the derivative is cubic, which can have up to three roots). So with three critical points, the graph of f(x) will have two local minima and one local maximum, or two maxima and one minima. But given that the leading coefficient is positive, as x approaches ±∞, f(x) goes to +∞. Therefore, the rightmost and leftmost critical points must be minima. So the structure would be: starting from the left, the function decreases to a local maximum, then increases to a local minimum, then decreases again to a local maximum, and then increases to infinity? Wait, that doesn&#x27;t make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if the derivative has three real roots, then the original function f(x) has three critical points. Let me label them as x₁ &lt; x₂ &lt; x₃. Since the leading term is positive, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, and the same as x approaches -infty. So, the rightmost critical point x₃ must be a local minimum (since after that, the function increases to infinity), and the leftmost critical point x₁ must be a local maximum (since coming from -infty, the function is decreasing until x₁, then starts increasing). Wait, no, that seems contradictory. Let me check:

If x approaches -infty, f(x) tends to +infty, so as we move from left to right (from -infty to +infty), the function starts at +infty, then at some point x₁ (the leftmost critical point) it might turn. If x₁ is a local maximum, then after x₁, the function decreases. Then, at x₂, another critical point, which would have to be a local minimum, so after x₂, the function increases again. Then at x₃, another critical point, which would be a local maximum, and then after x₃, the function decreases. But wait, but after x₃, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, which is a contradiction because if x₃ is a local maximum, then after x₃, the function should decrease, but it actually needs to increase to +infty. Therefore, that can&#x27;t be. Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the leftmost critical point x₁ is a local minimum. Let&#x27;s see: starting from -infty, f(x) is going to +infty. Then at x₁, which is a local minimum, the function starts increasing. Then at x₂, a local maximum, so after x₂, the function decreases. Then at x₃, another local minimum, so after x₃, the function increases again towards +infty. That makes sense. So the critical points are arranged as local minimum at x₁, local maximum at x₂, local minimum at x₃. Therefore, the graph has two local minima and one local maximum.

So the function f(x) would start at +infty, decrease to a local minimum at x₁, then increase to a local maximum at x₂, then decrease to a local minimum at x₃, and then increase again to +infty. So, the graph would look like a &quot;W&quot; but with the middle peak being a local maximum and the two valleys being local minima. So, the function has two local minima and one local maximum.

Given that structure, let&#x27;s consider the possible number of real roots for f(x) = k. Depending on the value of k, the horizontal line y = k can intersect the graph of f(x) in different ways.

If k is greater than the value of the local maximum at x₂, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃, because the function only exceeds k on the far left and far right.

If k is exactly equal to the value of the local maximum at x₂, then f(x) = k would have three real roots: one at x₂ (with multiplicity two, since it&#x27;s a local maximum) and one on each side (left of x₁ and right of x₃). But wait, if the local maximum is exactly at k, then the graph touches the line y = k at x₂, so that&#x27;s a double root, and crosses the line on either side. So three real roots, but one of them is a double root.

If k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two local minima, then suppose the local minima at x₁ and x₃ have values m₁ and m₃. Let&#x27;s assume that one of the minima is lower than the other. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, both minima must be below the local maximum. However, depending on the specific coefficients, one minimum could be lower than the other. Let&#x27;s say, without loss of generality, that m₁ &lt; m₃ (the left local minimum is lower than the right local minimum). Then, if k is between m₃ and the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots: two on the left side (between -infty and x₁, and between x₁ and x₂), and two on the right side (between x₂ and x₃, and between x₃ and +infty). Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two minima, say between M and m₃ (assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), then when k is in (m₃, M), the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. But actually, when you have two minima and one maximum, the graph goes from +infty to m₁ (local min), rises to M (local max), then falls to m₃ (local min), then rises again to +infty. So if k is between m₁ and M, then depending on where k is relative to m₃, the number of roots changes.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch a rough graph mentally. Starting from the left (x approaching -infty), f(x) is at +infty, decreases to m₁ at x₁ (local min), then increases to M at x₂ (local max), then decreases to m₃ at x₃ (local min), then increases back to +infty.

So, if k is greater than M, then the equation f(x) = k has two real roots: one on the far left and one on the far right.

If k is equal to M, then it has three real roots: one at x₂ (a double root) and one on each side.

If k is between m₃ and M, then it has four real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, one between x₂ and x₃, and one right of x₃.

If k is equal to m₃, then it has three real roots: one at x₃ (double root) and one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂.

If k is between m₁ and m₃, then it has two real roots: one left of x₁ and one right of x₃, because the horizontal line y = k only intersects the graph on the leftmost and rightmost ascending parts. Wait, but between x₁ and x₃, the function reaches a maximum at x₂, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, then the line y = k would cross the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. Wait, but if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the minima, but since m₁ is lower than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ to M, so it must cross y = k once there. Similarly, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then since m₃ is higher than m₁, and k is between m₁ and m₃, then on the interval x₂ to x₃, the function decreases from M to m₃, crossing y = k once. Similarly, on the interval x₃ to +infty, the function increases from m₃ to +infty, so y = k would cross once there. Similarly, on the interval -infty to x₁, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, crossing y = k once. Therefore, actually, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots. If k is equal to m₁, then it&#x27;s a double root at x₁ and another root on the right. Similarly, if k is equal to m₃, it&#x27;s a double root at x₃ and another root on the left. If k is less than m₁, since m₁ is the lower of the two minima, then the line y = k would intersect the graph only twice: once left of x₁ and once right of x₃. Wait, no. If k is less than m₁, which is the minimum, then the graph only reaches down to m₁, so y = k would not intersect the graph at all? Wait, no. Wait, as x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches +infty, and at x₁, it&#x27;s a local minimum m₁. So if k &lt; m₁, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃? Wait, but if k is less than m₁, which is the minimum value on the left side, then on the left side, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, so it must cross y = k once. On the right side, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is higher than m₁) up to +infty, so if k is less than m₁, then since m₃ is greater than m₁, and k is less than m₁, then on the right side, the function starts at m₃ (which is greater than k) and increases to infinity, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, if k &lt; m₁, there is only one real root on the left side. Similarly, if k &gt; M, there are two real roots on the extremes. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to tabulate the different cases.

Let me denote:

- The leftmost local minimum at x = x₁ with f(x₁) = m₁.

- The local maximum at x = x₂ with f(x₂) = M.

- The rightmost local minimum at x = x₃ with f(x₃) = m₃.

Assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ (since x₁ &lt; x₃ and the function might have asymmetrical minima), though it could also be m₃ &lt; m₁. Wait, but since the function is going from m₁ up to M, then down to m₃, and then up again. The relative positions of m₁ and m₃ depend on the specific coefficients. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify, so I can&#x27;t assume which is lower. Therefore, perhaps I need to consider both possibilities. But maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter. Let&#x27;s suppose m₁ ≤ m₃ for definiteness. Then:

- If k &gt; M: two real roots (left and right).

- If k = M: three real roots (one double root at x₂ and two simple roots on the sides).

- If m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots (left, between x₁ and x₂, between x₂ and x₃, right).

- If k = m₃: three real roots (double root at x₃ and two others).

- If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: four real roots (similar to above? Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, but the function between x₁ and x₂ goes up to M, which is higher than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function crosses y = k once (since it goes from m₁ to M), between x₂ and x₃, it crosses once (since it goes from M to m₃), and on both ends, left of x₁ and right of x₃, the function is above k? Wait, no. Wait, the left end (x approaching -infty) is +infty, so coming from the left, the function starts at +infty, decreases to m₁ (which is less than k, since k &gt; m₁), so it must cross y = k once on the left side (before x₁). Then, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross there. Wait, but m₃ is greater than k, so after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so if m₃ &gt; k, then it never crosses y = k again. Therefore, in this case, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k has three real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, and one between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought.

Wait, perhaps I need to more carefully analyze:

Case 1: k &gt; M. Then, the horizontal line y = k cuts the graph at two points: one far left (before x₁) and one far right (after x₃).

Case 2: k = M. The line touches the local maximum at x₂ and cuts the graph on the left and right sides, resulting in three real roots (one double root at x₂).

Case 3: m₃ &lt; k &lt; M. The line y = k intersects the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃.

Wait, but if m₃ is the right local minimum, and k is greater than m₃ but less than M, then after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so since k &gt; m₃, there will be a crossing right of x₃. Similarly, left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is less than k (since k &gt; m₃ and m₃ &gt; m₁, so k &gt; m₁). Therefore, left of x₁, the function crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ (which is less than k) up to M (which is greater than k), so crosses once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is less than k), so crosses once. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to infinity, crossing once. Therefore, four crossings. So that&#x27;s four real roots.

Case 4: k = m₃. The line touches the local minimum at x₃, so it&#x27;s a double root there, and crosses the graph left of x₁ and between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so at k = m₃, it only touches at x₃. Therefore, the roots would be left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂ (since the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing k = m₃ if m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), but wait, m₃ is the value at x₃, which is a local minimum. If k = m₃, then between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so it reaches m₃ at x₃. Therefore, if k = m₃, then there&#x27;s a root at x₃ (double root) and another root left of x₁ (since the function decreases from +infty to m₁, which is less than m₃, so crosses y = m₃ once left of x₁) and another root between x₁ and x₂ (as the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing y = m₃ once). So total of three roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and a double root at x₃.

Case 5: m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃. Here, k is between the two local minima. Since m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum. Let&#x27;s assume m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph as follows:

- Left of x₁: the function comes down from +infty to m₁, which is less than k, so it crosses y = k once.

- Between x₁ and x₂: the function goes from m₁ (less than k) up to M (greater than k), so crosses once.

- Between x₂ and x₃: the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so crosses once.

- Right of x₃: the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = k there.

Therefore, total of three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃.

Wait, but hold on. If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃, then m₃ is greater than k, so right of x₃, the function starts at m₃ and goes up, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, only three real roots? But earlier, when k is between m₃ and M, we had four roots. Hmm.

Case 6: k = m₁. The line touches the left local minimum at x₁, resulting in a double root there. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than m₁), so if k = m₁, which is less than m₃, the function crosses y = k once between x₂ and x₃. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ to +infty, which is above k, so no crossing. Also, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M, so crosses y = k once. Wait, but if k = m₁, then between x₁ and x₂, the function starts at m₁ (k) and goes up, so the crossing is exactly at x₁, which is a double root. Then, another crossing between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, three real roots: double root at x₁ and single roots between x₂ and x₃ and right of x₃? Wait, no. Wait, if k = m₁, then at x₁, the function has a local minimum. So the graph touches y = k at x₁, and then goes up. On the left side, as x approaches -infty, the function approaches +infty, so it comes down from +infty to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, left of x₁, there&#x27;s no crossing since it&#x27;s decreasing to m₁. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root because it&#x27;s a local minimum). Then, moving from x₁ to x₂, the function increases to M, which is greater than m₁, so there&#x27;s no crossing there. Then, from x₂ to x₃, the function decreases to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Then, from x₃ to +infty, the function increases to +infty, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = m₁ again. Therefore, total of two real roots: a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but the original function at x approaching -infty is +infty, so when approaching from the left, the function decreases to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, for k = m₁, the leftmost intersection is exactly at x₁ (a double root), and then another intersection between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, two real roots (one double, one single). But in the context of the problem, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot; or &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, do they count multiplicity? The problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for option (a). If they count multiplicity, then at k = m₁, f(x) = k has two real roots (one double, one single). If they don&#x27;t count multiplicity, then maybe it&#x27;s considered as two real roots (but one is a double root). Wait, the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;. So if multiplicity is considered, then a double root would count as one root, but actually, in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s still one. Wait, no. Wait, multiplicity is about the number of roots counting multiplicity. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, which might mean exactly one distinct real root, or exactly one real root counting multiplicity. The question is ambiguous, but in standard terminology, &quot;exactly one real root&quot; usually refers to exactly one distinct real root, but in some contexts, it might count multiplicity. However, in options (b) and (c), they mention &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; and &quot;four distinct real roots&quot;, so it seems like they are distinguishing between distinct roots and multiple roots. Therefore, for (a), &quot;exactly one real root&quot; probably means exactly one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. Similarly, for (b), &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;. So in the case where k = m₁, we have a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃, so that&#x27;s two distinct real roots (x₁ with multiplicity two and another root). Therefore, (a) is not satisfied here.

Case 7: k &lt; m₁. Then, the horizontal line y = k is below both local minima. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, the line y = k would intersect the graph twice: once on the far left (before x₁) and once on the far right (after x₃). Therefore, two real roots.

So summarizing:

- k &gt; M: two real roots.

- k = M: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots.

- k = m₃: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: three real roots.

- k = m₁: three real roots (one double, two simple? Wait, earlier analysis said two roots, but maybe I messed up).

Wait, let me re-examine k = m₁. If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root) and since between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, total of two distinct real roots: x₁ (double) and one between x₂ and x₃. So, in terms of distinct roots, two; in terms of total roots counting multiplicity, three. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for (a). If &quot;exactly one&quot; means one distinct root, then even if it&#x27;s a double root, that would still be considered one real root. But in standard terminology, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, they usually mean one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. However, in the case of k = M, we have three real roots but one is a double root. The problem&#x27;s option (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, so distinctness is important there. So, for (a), if there exists a k where f(x) = k has exactly one real root (distinct or not?), the answer depends on that.

But in the case where k is less than m₁, we have two distinct real roots. If k is equal to m₁, we have two real roots (x₁ is a double root, and another one). If k is between m₁ and m₃, three real roots. If k is equal to m₃ or M, three real roots (with a double root). If k is between m₃ and M, four real roots. If k is greater than M, two real roots.

Wait, but in none of these cases do we have exactly one real root. Even when k is less than m₁, we have two real roots. When k equals m₁ or m₃ or M, we have two or three real roots but with multiplicities. So, there is no k for which f(x) = k has exactly one real root, right? Unless when the polynomial is tangent to the line y = k at one point and doesn&#x27;t cross it elsewhere, but given the shape of the quartic, which tends to +infty on both sides, if the horizontal line is tangent at the local maximum or one of the minima, it will still cross the graph on one side or the other. Wait, for example, if k is equal to the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = M has a double root at x₂ and two other roots on the left and right. Wait, no. Wait, at k = M, the horizontal line touches the local maximum at x₂. To the left of x₂, the function is increasing from m₁ to M, so it only reaches M at x₂. To the right of x₂, the function decreases from M to m₃ and then increases again. Therefore, the line y = M would intersect the graph only at x₂ (a double root) and on the right side as the function increases past M again? Wait, no. Wait, after x₃, the function increases from m₃ to +infty. If M is the local maximum, then m₃ is less than M. So, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is less than M) up to +infty, so it must cross y = M once after x₃. Similarly, to the left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁ (which is less than M), so it must cross y = M once before x₁. Therefore, when k = M, the equation f(x) = M has three real roots: one at x₂ (double root) and one on each side. Therefore, three distinct real roots? Wait, but x₂ is a double root, so in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s three: x₂, and one on each side. So multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect distinctness. Therefore, even though x₂ is a double root, it&#x27;s still one distinct root. So in that case, k = M gives three distinct real roots, with one of them being a double root. Wait, no. If a root is a double root, it&#x27;s still a single distinct root; the distinctness refers to the x-values. So x₂ is one distinct root, and the other two are also distinct. So in total, three distinct real roots, one with multiplicity two. Therefore, for the problem&#x27;s option (b): &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Well, when k = M or k = m₁ or k = m₃, you have three real roots, but with one double root. But the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would require all three roots to be distinct, i.e., no multiple roots. So in that case, even though at k = M you have three real roots, one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. Therefore, the answer would be that statement (b) is false. Wait, but when k is between m₃ and M, we have four distinct real roots. When k is between m₁ and m₃, three distinct real roots. When k is less than m₁ or greater than M, two distinct real roots. When k equals M, m₁, or m₃, three real roots with one double root.

Therefore, the statement (b) says: &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Given that when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three distinct real roots (as per the earlier analysis). Wait, earlier I thought when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three real roots. Wait, let&#x27;s recheck.

Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two local minima, then depending on the graph, how does the horizontal line intersect? Suppose m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum, with m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, k between m₁ and m₃ would be above m₁ and below m₃. Then, on the left side (x &lt; x₁), the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is below k, so it crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is above k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross. Therefore, three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots because they are in different intervals. Therefore, statement (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima, we get three distinct real roots. Additionally, if m₁ &gt; m₃, then similar logic applies, just switch left and right.

Therefore, regardless of the relative positions of the minima, there exists a k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Therefore, option (b) is true.

But wait, the answer options are (a), (b), (c), (d). Let&#x27;s check the options again:

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

From the analysis above:

- (a) is false because for any real k, f(x) = k has either two, three, or four real roots. There is no k where it has exactly one real root.

- (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima (or between the higher local minimum and the local maximum, but actually in our case, between m₁ and m₃, assuming m₁ &lt; m₃), the equation f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

Wait, earlier, when k is between m₁ and m₃, which are both minima, the horizontal line y = k intersects the graph three times: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots.

- (c) is false because when k is greater than M or less than m₁ (the lower of the two minima), f(x) = k has only two real roots.

- (d) is false because when k is between the two local minima or between a local minimum and the local maximum, f(x) = k has four or three real roots, respectively, so not always two real and two complex roots.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

But wait, the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, and the options are (a)-(d). The analysis above suggests that (b) is true. However, in the initial problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots. Wait, but in our analysis, we concluded that between the two local minima, we can get three real roots. But the key is that the quartic has three critical points: two minima and one maximum or two maxima and one minima, but in this case, with leading coefficient positive, it&#x27;s two minima and one maximum.

But let me verify with an example. Take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x + 1. Wait, maybe a simpler example. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 2x³ - 3x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 6x² - 6x. Let&#x27;s find the critical points.

Wait, maybe a better example is f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has three real roots: x = 0, x = sqrt(2), x = -sqrt(2). So the critical points are at x = -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). Then f(x) at these points: f(-sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(2))⁴ - 4*(sqrt(2))² = 4 - 8 = -4. f(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. f(sqrt(2)) = same as f(-sqrt(2)) = -4. So the local minima are at x = ±sqrt(2) with f(x) = -4, and the local maximum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0. So this is a symmetric quartic. Then, for k between -4 and 0, f(x) = k has four real roots. For k = 0, it has three real roots (double root at x = 0 and two at ±sqrt(something)). For k &lt; -4, two real roots. For k &gt; 0, two real roots. For k between the minima and the maximum (i.e., between -4 and 0), four real roots. For k exactly at -4, three real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). Wait, but in this case, the two minima are equal. So here, m₁ = m₃ = -4. Therefore, there is no interval between m₁ and m₃; they are the same. Therefore, in this symmetric case, when k is between -4 and 0, you get four real roots, but when k is exactly -4, you get two real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). However, the original problem states that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does: -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). So in this case, the two minima are equal. Therefore, if the two local minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are equal), so the three real roots case doesn&#x27;t occur. Wait, but the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; for f’(x). In this example, f’(x) has three distinct real roots. But in this case, the minima are equal, so between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, you get four real roots. But if the minima are not equal, then between them, you would have three real roots.

Therefore, the key is whether the two local minima can be at different heights. If f’(x) has three distinct real roots, but the function f(x) could still have two equal minima. Wait, but in the example above, even with symmetric critical points, the minima are equal. So perhaps, depending on the coefficients, the minima can be equal or not. Therefore, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether the minima are equal or not, only that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Therefore, in some cases, you might have equal minima, in others not. Therefore, the answer would depend on whether, regardless of the specific f(x) meeting the condition, statement (b) is always true.

But wait, in the example where minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are the same), so the three real roots case would not exist. However, in that case, when k is between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, which is the same as saying between m and M, you get four real roots. When k is less than m or greater than M, you get two real roots. When k equals m, you get two double roots. When k equals M, you get three real roots (a double root and two simple roots). Therefore, in the symmetric case, statement (b) is false because there is no k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. When k = M, you have three real roots but one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. When k is between m and M, you have four distinct real roots. When k is less than m, two distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric case, statement (b) is false. But the problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does, but the minima are equal. Therefore, the correct answer would not always be (b). Therefore, my previous analysis was incorrect.

Therefore, there&#x27;s a problem: if the quartic is symmetric, with two equal minima, then there is no k for which f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) would not hold in such cases. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot; given that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Since there exist such polynomials where statement (b) is false, but there also exist polynomials where statement (b) is true. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the statement must hold for all such polynomials or if there exists at least one. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, implying that the statement must be always true given the conditions.

Therefore, since there exists a polynomial where f’(x) has three distinct real roots but there&#x27;s no k with three distinct real roots (like the symmetric quartic example), statement (b) is not always true. Therefore, my previous conclusion was wrong.

Then, what is the correct answer? Let&#x27;s re-examine the options.

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

In the symmetric example, the only possible numbers of real roots are two (k &lt; m), four (m &lt; k &lt; M), three (k = m or k = M), or two (k &gt; M). So in this case, there is no k with exactly one real root. Therefore, statement (a) is false.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric example, when k = m or k = M, we have three real roots but with a double root, so they are not distinct. Therefore, in this case, there is no k with three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) is false.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

False, since for k &gt; M or k &lt; m, there are only two real roots.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

False, since for some k, there are four real roots.

Therefore, in this case, none of the options are true? But that can&#x27;t be, because the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the symmetric example. Let&#x27;s take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has roots at x = 0, sqrt(2), -sqrt(2). So three distinct real roots. The function f(x) = x⁴ - 4x² has local maxima at x = 0 (f(0) = 0) and local minima at x = ±sqrt(2) (f(±sqrt(2)) = -4). Then, for k = -4, the equation f(x) = -4 has double roots at x = ±sqrt(2). For k = 0, it has a double root at x = 0 and simple roots at x = ±2. So, in this case, when k = 0, the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. Therefore, three real roots, but only two distinct ones (x = 0 and x = ±2). Wait, no. If x = ±2 are roots, then total roots are x = 0 (double), x = 2, and x = -2. So four roots total, but with x = 0 counted twice. However, the equation x⁴ - 4x² = 0 factors as x²(x² - 4) = 0, so roots at x = 0 (multiplicity 2), x = 2, x = -2. So in this case, for k = 0, there are three distinct real roots (0, 2, -2), with one of them being a double root. Therefore, in terms of distinct real roots, it&#x27;s three. So, statement (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would be true here because even though 0 is a double root, the roots are still distinct: -2, 0, 2. So in this case, k = 0 gives three distinct real roots, even with a double root at 0. Therefore, perhaps in this example, statement (b) is true.

Wait, but if we take k = -4, then f(x) = -4 has roots at x = ±sqrt(2), each with multiplicity two. So, two distinct real roots, each a double root. Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is not satisfied for k = -4, but for k = 0, we have three distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric example, there does exist a k (specifically k = 0) such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) is true.

But earlier, I thought that when the minima are equal, there&#x27;s no k between them, but in reality, even in the symmetric case, there is a k (the local maximum) where you have three distinct real roots. So regardless of whether the minima are equal or not, the local maximum will always provide a k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Let me check.

In the symmetric example, at k = 0 (the local maximum), the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double root) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) holds.

If we take another example where the minima are not equal. Let’s construct a quartic with two unequal minima. For example, f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x. Compute its derivative: f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x² + 4x + 4. I need to check if this derivative has three distinct real roots. Instead of computing, maybe take a known quartic. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 6x² + 4x. Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x + 4. Let&#x27;s check the roots of f’(x). Maybe this cubic has three real roots. Alternatively, use f(x) = x⁴ - 3x³ - 3x² + 4x + 1. Not sure. Alternatively, take f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4), but that would have four real roots, but its derivative would have three critical points. However, expanding this would be time-consuming.

Alternatively, take a quartic with two minima at different heights. Suppose f(x) has a local minimum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0, a local maximum at x = 1 with f(1) = 2, and another local minimum at x = 2 with f(2) = 1. Then, the function would go from +infty down to 0 at x = 0, up to 2 at x = 1, down to 1 at x = 2, and back up to +infty. In this case, m₁ = 0, M = 2, m₃ = 1. Then, for k between m₁ = 0 and m₃ = 1, the equation f(x) = k would have three distinct real roots: one left of 0, one between 0 and 1, and one between 1 and 2. For k between m₃ = 1 and M = 2, four distinct real roots. For k = 1, three real roots (double root at x = 2 and two others). For k = 0, three real roots (double root at x = 0 and one other). For k = 2, three real roots (double root at x = 1 and two others). For k &lt; 0, two real roots; for k &gt; 2, two real roots.

Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k between 0 and 1 (the two minima) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric case, even though the minima are equal, there&#x27;s still a k = M where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots (with a double root at the local maximum). Wait, no. In the symmetric case, k = M is the local maximum. For example, in f(x) = x⁴ - 4x², the local maximum is at x = 0 with k = 0. The equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, even in the symmetric case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k (specifically k = M) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Even though one of them is a double root, but the roots are still distinct in terms of their x-values. Wait, no. A double root at x = 0 means that x = 0 is a repeated root, but the distinct roots are x = -2, x = 0, x = 2. Therefore, three distinct real roots. The multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect the distinctness. Therefore, even if there is a multiple root, as long as there are three separate x-values, it&#x27;s three distinct real roots. Therefore, in both symmetric and asymmetric cases, statement (b) holds.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) with real coefficients, we know that its derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) has three distinct real roots. This implies that \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum (since the leading coefficient is positive, the polynomial tends to \( +\infty \) as \( x \to \pm\infty \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Critical Points and Graph Shape**:
   - The polynomial \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum.
   - The graph of \( f(x) \) will have a &quot;W&quot; shape with two local minima and one local maximum.

2. **Behavior of \( f(x) = k \)**:
   - For \( k \) values greater than the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local maximum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the local maximum and the higher local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has four real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to either local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local minimum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the two local minima, \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - For \( k \) values less than the lower local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.

3. **Evaluation of Statements**:
   - **(a)** False: There is no \( k \) such that \( f(x) = k \) has exactly one real root.
   - **(b)** True: There exists a \( k \) (between the two local minima) where \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - **(c)** False: \( f(x) = k \) does not always have four distinct real roots (e.g., for \( k \) outside the range between the local minima and maximum).
   - **(d)** False: \( f(x) = k \) can have four real roots for some \( k \), so it does not always have two real and two complex roots.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is \(\boxed{B}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out which of the statements (a), (b), (c), or (d) is true given that the polynomial f(x) = x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d has a derivative f’(x) with three distinct real roots. Let me start by recalling some calculus and polynomial theory.

First, since f(x) is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, its derivative f’(x) is a cubic (degree 3) polynomial. The problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. That means the derivative has three distinct critical points where the slope of f(x) is zero. For a cubic polynomial to have three distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive, but I might not need to compute that here. The key takeaway is that the original function f(x) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum, or two local maxima and one local minimum. Since the derivative is a cubic with three real roots, it must alternate between increasing and decreasing appropriately.

Now, the graph of a quartic polynomial typically has a &quot;W&quot; shape or an &quot;M&quot; shape depending on the leading coefficient. Since the leading term here is x⁴, which has a positive coefficient, as x approaches positive or negative infinity, f(x) tends to positive infinity. Therefore, the graph will eventually rise on both ends. Given that the derivative has three real roots, there are three critical points. For a quartic with positive leading coefficient, the typical shape with three critical points would be two local minima and one local maximum in between. So, the graph would go up, then down, then up, then down, then up again? Wait, no. Wait, the derivative is cubic, so it can have three critical points. So the original function f(x) will have three turning points. Since it&#x27;s a quartic, it can have up to three turning points (since the derivative is cubic, which can have up to three roots). So with three critical points, the graph of f(x) will have two local minima and one local maximum, or two maxima and one minima. But given that the leading coefficient is positive, as x approaches ±∞, f(x) goes to +∞. Therefore, the rightmost and leftmost critical points must be minima. So the structure would be: starting from the left, the function decreases to a local maximum, then increases to a local minimum, then decreases again to a local maximum, and then increases to infinity? Wait, that doesn&#x27;t make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if the derivative has three real roots, then the original function f(x) has three critical points. Let me label them as x₁ &lt; x₂ &lt; x₃. Since the leading term is positive, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, and the same as x approaches -infty. So, the rightmost critical point x₃ must be a local minimum (since after that, the function increases to infinity), and the leftmost critical point x₁ must be a local maximum (since coming from -infty, the function is decreasing until x₁, then starts increasing). Wait, no, that seems contradictory. Let me check:

If x approaches -infty, f(x) tends to +infty, so as we move from left to right (from -infty to +infty), the function starts at +infty, then at some point x₁ (the leftmost critical point) it might turn. If x₁ is a local maximum, then after x₁, the function decreases. Then, at x₂, another critical point, which would have to be a local minimum, so after x₂, the function increases again. Then at x₃, another critical point, which would be a local maximum, and then after x₃, the function decreases. But wait, but after x₃, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, which is a contradiction because if x₃ is a local maximum, then after x₃, the function should decrease, but it actually needs to increase to +infty. Therefore, that can&#x27;t be. Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the leftmost critical point x₁ is a local minimum. Let&#x27;s see: starting from -infty, f(x) is going to +infty. Then at x₁, which is a local minimum, the function starts increasing. Then at x₂, a local maximum, so after x₂, the function decreases. Then at x₃, another local minimum, so after x₃, the function increases again towards +infty. That makes sense. So the critical points are arranged as local minimum at x₁, local maximum at x₂, local minimum at x₃. Therefore, the graph has two local minima and one local maximum.

So the function f(x) would start at +infty, decrease to a local minimum at x₁, then increase to a local maximum at x₂, then decrease to a local minimum at x₃, and then increase again to +infty. So, the graph would look like a &quot;W&quot; but with the middle peak being a local maximum and the two valleys being local minima. So, the function has two local minima and one local maximum.

Given that structure, let&#x27;s consider the possible number of real roots for f(x) = k. Depending on the value of k, the horizontal line y = k can intersect the graph of f(x) in different ways.

If k is greater than the value of the local maximum at x₂, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃, because the function only exceeds k on the far left and far right.

If k is exactly equal to the value of the local maximum at x₂, then f(x) = k would have three real roots: one at x₂ (with multiplicity two, since it&#x27;s a local maximum) and one on each side (left of x₁ and right of x₃). But wait, if the local maximum is exactly at k, then the graph touches the line y = k at x₂, so that&#x27;s a double root, and crosses the line on either side. So three real roots, but one of them is a double root.

If k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two local minima, then suppose the local minima at x₁ and x₃ have values m₁ and m₃. Let&#x27;s assume that one of the minima is lower than the other. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, both minima must be below the local maximum. However, depending on the specific coefficients, one minimum could be lower than the other. Let&#x27;s say, without loss of generality, that m₁ &lt; m₃ (the left local minimum is lower than the right local minimum). Then, if k is between m₃ and the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots: two on the left side (between -infty and x₁, and between x₁ and x₂), and two on the right side (between x₂ and x₃, and between x₃ and +infty). Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two minima, say between M and m₃ (assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), then when k is in (m₃, M), the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. But actually, when you have two minima and one maximum, the graph goes from +infty to m₁ (local min), rises to M (local max), then falls to m₃ (local min), then rises again to +infty. So if k is between m₁ and M, then depending on where k is relative to m₃, the number of roots changes.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch a rough graph mentally. Starting from the left (x approaching -infty), f(x) is at +infty, decreases to m₁ at x₁ (local min), then increases to M at x₂ (local max), then decreases to m₃ at x₃ (local min), then increases back to +infty.

So, if k is greater than M, then the equation f(x) = k has two real roots: one on the far left and one on the far right.

If k is equal to M, then it has three real roots: one at x₂ (a double root) and one on each side.

If k is between m₃ and M, then it has four real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, one between x₂ and x₃, and one right of x₃.

If k is equal to m₃, then it has three real roots: one at x₃ (double root) and one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂.

If k is between m₁ and m₃, then it has two real roots: one left of x₁ and one right of x₃, because the horizontal line y = k only intersects the graph on the leftmost and rightmost ascending parts. Wait, but between x₁ and x₃, the function reaches a maximum at x₂, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, then the line y = k would cross the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. Wait, but if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the minima, but since m₁ is lower than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ to M, so it must cross y = k once there. Similarly, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then since m₃ is higher than m₁, and k is between m₁ and m₃, then on the interval x₂ to x₃, the function decreases from M to m₃, crossing y = k once. Similarly, on the interval x₃ to +infty, the function increases from m₃ to +infty, so y = k would cross once there. Similarly, on the interval -infty to x₁, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, crossing y = k once. Therefore, actually, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots. If k is equal to m₁, then it&#x27;s a double root at x₁ and another root on the right. Similarly, if k is equal to m₃, it&#x27;s a double root at x₃ and another root on the left. If k is less than m₁, since m₁ is the lower of the two minima, then the line y = k would intersect the graph only twice: once left of x₁ and once right of x₃. Wait, no. If k is less than m₁, which is the minimum, then the graph only reaches down to m₁, so y = k would not intersect the graph at all? Wait, no. Wait, as x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches +infty, and at x₁, it&#x27;s a local minimum m₁. So if k &lt; m₁, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃? Wait, but if k is less than m₁, which is the minimum value on the left side, then on the left side, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, so it must cross y = k once. On the right side, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is higher than m₁) up to +infty, so if k is less than m₁, then since m₃ is greater than m₁, and k is less than m₁, then on the right side, the function starts at m₃ (which is greater than k) and increases to infinity, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, if k &lt; m₁, there is only one real root on the left side. Similarly, if k &gt; M, there are two real roots on the extremes. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to tabulate the different cases.

Let me denote:

- The leftmost local minimum at x = x₁ with f(x₁) = m₁.

- The local maximum at x = x₂ with f(x₂) = M.

- The rightmost local minimum at x = x₃ with f(x₃) = m₃.

Assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ (since x₁ &lt; x₃ and the function might have asymmetrical minima), though it could also be m₃ &lt; m₁. Wait, but since the function is going from m₁ up to M, then down to m₃, and then up again. The relative positions of m₁ and m₃ depend on the specific coefficients. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify, so I can&#x27;t assume which is lower. Therefore, perhaps I need to consider both possibilities. But maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter. Let&#x27;s suppose m₁ ≤ m₃ for definiteness. Then:

- If k &gt; M: two real roots (left and right).

- If k = M: three real roots (one double root at x₂ and two simple roots on the sides).

- If m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots (left, between x₁ and x₂, between x₂ and x₃, right).

- If k = m₃: three real roots (double root at x₃ and two others).

- If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: four real roots (similar to above? Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, but the function between x₁ and x₂ goes up to M, which is higher than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function crosses y = k once (since it goes from m₁ to M), between x₂ and x₃, it crosses once (since it goes from M to m₃), and on both ends, left of x₁ and right of x₃, the function is above k? Wait, no. Wait, the left end (x approaching -infty) is +infty, so coming from the left, the function starts at +infty, decreases to m₁ (which is less than k, since k &gt; m₁), so it must cross y = k once on the left side (before x₁). Then, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross there. Wait, but m₃ is greater than k, so after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so if m₃ &gt; k, then it never crosses y = k again. Therefore, in this case, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k has three real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, and one between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought.

Wait, perhaps I need to more carefully analyze:

Case 1: k &gt; M. Then, the horizontal line y = k cuts the graph at two points: one far left (before x₁) and one far right (after x₃).

Case 2: k = M. The line touches the local maximum at x₂ and cuts the graph on the left and right sides, resulting in three real roots (one double root at x₂).

Case 3: m₃ &lt; k &lt; M. The line y = k intersects the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃.

Wait, but if m₃ is the right local minimum, and k is greater than m₃ but less than M, then after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so since k &gt; m₃, there will be a crossing right of x₃. Similarly, left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is less than k (since k &gt; m₃ and m₃ &gt; m₁, so k &gt; m₁). Therefore, left of x₁, the function crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ (which is less than k) up to M (which is greater than k), so crosses once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is less than k), so crosses once. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to infinity, crossing once. Therefore, four crossings. So that&#x27;s four real roots.

Case 4: k = m₃. The line touches the local minimum at x₃, so it&#x27;s a double root there, and crosses the graph left of x₁ and between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so at k = m₃, it only touches at x₃. Therefore, the roots would be left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂ (since the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing k = m₃ if m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), but wait, m₃ is the value at x₃, which is a local minimum. If k = m₃, then between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so it reaches m₃ at x₃. Therefore, if k = m₃, then there&#x27;s a root at x₃ (double root) and another root left of x₁ (since the function decreases from +infty to m₁, which is less than m₃, so crosses y = m₃ once left of x₁) and another root between x₁ and x₂ (as the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing y = m₃ once). So total of three roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and a double root at x₃.

Case 5: m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃. Here, k is between the two local minima. Since m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum. Let&#x27;s assume m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph as follows:

- Left of x₁: the function comes down from +infty to m₁, which is less than k, so it crosses y = k once.

- Between x₁ and x₂: the function goes from m₁ (less than k) up to M (greater than k), so crosses once.

- Between x₂ and x₃: the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so crosses once.

- Right of x₃: the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = k there.

Therefore, total of three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃.

Wait, but hold on. If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃, then m₃ is greater than k, so right of x₃, the function starts at m₃ and goes up, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, only three real roots? But earlier, when k is between m₃ and M, we had four roots. Hmm.

Case 6: k = m₁. The line touches the left local minimum at x₁, resulting in a double root there. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than m₁), so if k = m₁, which is less than m₃, the function crosses y = k once between x₂ and x₃. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ to +infty, which is above k, so no crossing. Also, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M, so crosses y = k once. Wait, but if k = m₁, then between x₁ and x₂, the function starts at m₁ (k) and goes up, so the crossing is exactly at x₁, which is a double root. Then, another crossing between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, three real roots: double root at x₁ and single roots between x₂ and x₃ and right of x₃? Wait, no. Wait, if k = m₁, then at x₁, the function has a local minimum. So the graph touches y = k at x₁, and then goes up. On the left side, as x approaches -infty, the function approaches +infty, so it comes down from +infty to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, left of x₁, there&#x27;s no crossing since it&#x27;s decreasing to m₁. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root because it&#x27;s a local minimum). Then, moving from x₁ to x₂, the function increases to M, which is greater than m₁, so there&#x27;s no crossing there. Then, from x₂ to x₃, the function decreases to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Then, from x₃ to +infty, the function increases to +infty, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = m₁ again. Therefore, total of two real roots: a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but the original function at x approaching -infty is +infty, so when approaching from the left, the function decreases to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, for k = m₁, the leftmost intersection is exactly at x₁ (a double root), and then another intersection between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, two real roots (one double, one single). But in the context of the problem, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot; or &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, do they count multiplicity? The problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for option (a). If they count multiplicity, then at k = m₁, f(x) = k has two real roots (one double, one single). If they don&#x27;t count multiplicity, then maybe it&#x27;s considered as two real roots (but one is a double root). Wait, the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;. So if multiplicity is considered, then a double root would count as one root, but actually, in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s still one. Wait, no. Wait, multiplicity is about the number of roots counting multiplicity. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, which might mean exactly one distinct real root, or exactly one real root counting multiplicity. The question is ambiguous, but in standard terminology, &quot;exactly one real root&quot; usually refers to exactly one distinct real root, but in some contexts, it might count multiplicity. However, in options (b) and (c), they mention &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; and &quot;four distinct real roots&quot;, so it seems like they are distinguishing between distinct roots and multiple roots. Therefore, for (a), &quot;exactly one real root&quot; probably means exactly one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. Similarly, for (b), &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;. So in the case where k = m₁, we have a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃, so that&#x27;s two distinct real roots (x₁ with multiplicity two and another root). Therefore, (a) is not satisfied here.

Case 7: k &lt; m₁. Then, the horizontal line y = k is below both local minima. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, the line y = k would intersect the graph twice: once on the far left (before x₁) and once on the far right (after x₃). Therefore, two real roots.

So summarizing:

- k &gt; M: two real roots.

- k = M: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots.

- k = m₃: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: three real roots.

- k = m₁: three real roots (one double, two simple? Wait, earlier analysis said two roots, but maybe I messed up).

Wait, let me re-examine k = m₁. If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root) and since between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, total of two distinct real roots: x₁ (double) and one between x₂ and x₃. So, in terms of distinct roots, two; in terms of total roots counting multiplicity, three. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for (a). If &quot;exactly one&quot; means one distinct root, then even if it&#x27;s a double root, that would still be considered one real root. But in standard terminology, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, they usually mean one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. However, in the case of k = M, we have three real roots but one is a double root. The problem&#x27;s option (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, so distinctness is important there. So, for (a), if there exists a k where f(x) = k has exactly one real root (distinct or not?), the answer depends on that.

But in the case where k is less than m₁, we have two distinct real roots. If k is equal to m₁, we have two real roots (x₁ is a double root, and another one). If k is between m₁ and m₃, three real roots. If k is equal to m₃ or M, three real roots (with a double root). If k is between m₃ and M, four real roots. If k is greater than M, two real roots.

Wait, but in none of these cases do we have exactly one real root. Even when k is less than m₁, we have two real roots. When k equals m₁ or m₃ or M, we have two or three real roots but with multiplicities. So, there is no k for which f(x) = k has exactly one real root, right? Unless when the polynomial is tangent to the line y = k at one point and doesn&#x27;t cross it elsewhere, but given the shape of the quartic, which tends to +infty on both sides, if the horizontal line is tangent at the local maximum or one of the minima, it will still cross the graph on one side or the other. Wait, for example, if k is equal to the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = M has a double root at x₂ and two other roots on the left and right. Wait, no. Wait, at k = M, the horizontal line touches the local maximum at x₂. To the left of x₂, the function is increasing from m₁ to M, so it only reaches M at x₂. To the right of x₂, the function decreases from M to m₃ and then increases again. Therefore, the line y = M would intersect the graph only at x₂ (a double root) and on the right side as the function increases past M again? Wait, no. Wait, after x₃, the function increases from m₃ to +infty. If M is the local maximum, then m₃ is less than M. So, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is less than M) up to +infty, so it must cross y = M once after x₃. Similarly, to the left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁ (which is less than M), so it must cross y = M once before x₁. Therefore, when k = M, the equation f(x) = M has three real roots: one at x₂ (double root) and one on each side. Therefore, three distinct real roots? Wait, but x₂ is a double root, so in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s three: x₂, and one on each side. So multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect distinctness. Therefore, even though x₂ is a double root, it&#x27;s still one distinct root. So in that case, k = M gives three distinct real roots, with one of them being a double root. Wait, no. If a root is a double root, it&#x27;s still a single distinct root; the distinctness refers to the x-values. So x₂ is one distinct root, and the other two are also distinct. So in total, three distinct real roots, one with multiplicity two. Therefore, for the problem&#x27;s option (b): &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Well, when k = M or k = m₁ or k = m₃, you have three real roots, but with one double root. But the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would require all three roots to be distinct, i.e., no multiple roots. So in that case, even though at k = M you have three real roots, one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. Therefore, the answer would be that statement (b) is false. Wait, but when k is between m₃ and M, we have four distinct real roots. When k is between m₁ and m₃, three distinct real roots. When k is less than m₁ or greater than M, two distinct real roots. When k equals M, m₁, or m₃, three real roots with one double root.

Therefore, the statement (b) says: &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Given that when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three distinct real roots (as per the earlier analysis). Wait, earlier I thought when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three real roots. Wait, let&#x27;s recheck.

Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two local minima, then depending on the graph, how does the horizontal line intersect? Suppose m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum, with m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, k between m₁ and m₃ would be above m₁ and below m₃. Then, on the left side (x &lt; x₁), the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is below k, so it crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is above k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross. Therefore, three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots because they are in different intervals. Therefore, statement (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima, we get three distinct real roots. Additionally, if m₁ &gt; m₃, then similar logic applies, just switch left and right.

Therefore, regardless of the relative positions of the minima, there exists a k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Therefore, option (b) is true.

But wait, the answer options are (a), (b), (c), (d). Let&#x27;s check the options again:

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

From the analysis above:

- (a) is false because for any real k, f(x) = k has either two, three, or four real roots. There is no k where it has exactly one real root.

- (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima (or between the higher local minimum and the local maximum, but actually in our case, between m₁ and m₃, assuming m₁ &lt; m₃), the equation f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

Wait, earlier, when k is between m₁ and m₃, which are both minima, the horizontal line y = k intersects the graph three times: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots.

- (c) is false because when k is greater than M or less than m₁ (the lower of the two minima), f(x) = k has only two real roots.

- (d) is false because when k is between the two local minima or between a local minimum and the local maximum, f(x) = k has four or three real roots, respectively, so not always two real and two complex roots.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

But wait, the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, and the options are (a)-(d). The analysis above suggests that (b) is true. However, in the initial problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots. Wait, but in our analysis, we concluded that between the two local minima, we can get three real roots. But the key is that the quartic has three critical points: two minima and one maximum or two maxima and one minima, but in this case, with leading coefficient positive, it&#x27;s two minima and one maximum.

But let me verify with an example. Take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x + 1. Wait, maybe a simpler example. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 2x³ - 3x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 6x² - 6x. Let&#x27;s find the critical points.

Wait, maybe a better example is f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has three real roots: x = 0, x = sqrt(2), x = -sqrt(2). So the critical points are at x = -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). Then f(x) at these points: f(-sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(2))⁴ - 4*(sqrt(2))² = 4 - 8 = -4. f(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. f(sqrt(2)) = same as f(-sqrt(2)) = -4. So the local minima are at x = ±sqrt(2) with f(x) = -4, and the local maximum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0. So this is a symmetric quartic. Then, for k between -4 and 0, f(x) = k has four real roots. For k = 0, it has three real roots (double root at x = 0 and two at ±sqrt(something)). For k &lt; -4, two real roots. For k &gt; 0, two real roots. For k between the minima and the maximum (i.e., between -4 and 0), four real roots. For k exactly at -4, three real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). Wait, but in this case, the two minima are equal. So here, m₁ = m₃ = -4. Therefore, there is no interval between m₁ and m₃; they are the same. Therefore, in this symmetric case, when k is between -4 and 0, you get four real roots, but when k is exactly -4, you get two real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). However, the original problem states that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does: -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). So in this case, the two minima are equal. Therefore, if the two local minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are equal), so the three real roots case doesn&#x27;t occur. Wait, but the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; for f’(x). In this example, f’(x) has three distinct real roots. But in this case, the minima are equal, so between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, you get four real roots. But if the minima are not equal, then between them, you would have three real roots.

Therefore, the key is whether the two local minima can be at different heights. If f’(x) has three distinct real roots, but the function f(x) could still have two equal minima. Wait, but in the example above, even with symmetric critical points, the minima are equal. So perhaps, depending on the coefficients, the minima can be equal or not. Therefore, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether the minima are equal or not, only that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Therefore, in some cases, you might have equal minima, in others not. Therefore, the answer would depend on whether, regardless of the specific f(x) meeting the condition, statement (b) is always true.

But wait, in the example where minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are the same), so the three real roots case would not exist. However, in that case, when k is between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, which is the same as saying between m and M, you get four real roots. When k is less than m or greater than M, you get two real roots. When k equals m, you get two double roots. When k equals M, you get three real roots (a double root and two simple roots). Therefore, in the symmetric case, statement (b) is false because there is no k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. When k = M, you have three real roots but one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. When k is between m and M, you have four distinct real roots. When k is less than m, two distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric case, statement (b) is false. But the problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does, but the minima are equal. Therefore, the correct answer would not always be (b). Therefore, my previous analysis was incorrect.

Therefore, there&#x27;s a problem: if the quartic is symmetric, with two equal minima, then there is no k for which f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) would not hold in such cases. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot; given that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Since there exist such polynomials where statement (b) is false, but there also exist polynomials where statement (b) is true. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the statement must hold for all such polynomials or if there exists at least one. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, implying that the statement must be always true given the conditions.

Therefore, since there exists a polynomial where f’(x) has three distinct real roots but there&#x27;s no k with three distinct real roots (like the symmetric quartic example), statement (b) is not always true. Therefore, my previous conclusion was wrong.

Then, what is the correct answer? Let&#x27;s re-examine the options.

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

In the symmetric example, the only possible numbers of real roots are two (k &lt; m), four (m &lt; k &lt; M), three (k = m or k = M), or two (k &gt; M). So in this case, there is no k with exactly one real root. Therefore, statement (a) is false.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric example, when k = m or k = M, we have three real roots but with a double root, so they are not distinct. Therefore, in this case, there is no k with three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) is false.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

False, since for k &gt; M or k &lt; m, there are only two real roots.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

False, since for some k, there are four real roots.

Therefore, in this case, none of the options are true? But that can&#x27;t be, because the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the symmetric example. Let&#x27;s take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has roots at x = 0, sqrt(2), -sqrt(2). So three distinct real roots. The function f(x) = x⁴ - 4x² has local maxima at x = 0 (f(0) = 0) and local minima at x = ±sqrt(2) (f(±sqrt(2)) = -4). Then, for k = -4, the equation f(x) = -4 has double roots at x = ±sqrt(2). For k = 0, it has a double root at x = 0 and simple roots at x = ±2. So, in this case, when k = 0, the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. Therefore, three real roots, but only two distinct ones (x = 0 and x = ±2). Wait, no. If x = ±2 are roots, then total roots are x = 0 (double), x = 2, and x = -2. So four roots total, but with x = 0 counted twice. However, the equation x⁴ - 4x² = 0 factors as x²(x² - 4) = 0, so roots at x = 0 (multiplicity 2), x = 2, x = -2. So in this case, for k = 0, there are three distinct real roots (0, 2, -2), with one of them being a double root. Therefore, in terms of distinct real roots, it&#x27;s three. So, statement (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would be true here because even though 0 is a double root, the roots are still distinct: -2, 0, 2. So in this case, k = 0 gives three distinct real roots, even with a double root at 0. Therefore, perhaps in this example, statement (b) is true.

Wait, but if we take k = -4, then f(x) = -4 has roots at x = ±sqrt(2), each with multiplicity two. So, two distinct real roots, each a double root. Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is not satisfied for k = -4, but for k = 0, we have three distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric example, there does exist a k (specifically k = 0) such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) is true.

But earlier, I thought that when the minima are equal, there&#x27;s no k between them, but in reality, even in the symmetric case, there is a k (the local maximum) where you have three distinct real roots. So regardless of whether the minima are equal or not, the local maximum will always provide a k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Let me check.

In the symmetric example, at k = 0 (the local maximum), the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double root) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) holds.

If we take another example where the minima are not equal. Let’s construct a quartic with two unequal minima. For example, f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x. Compute its derivative: f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x² + 4x + 4. I need to check if this derivative has three distinct real roots. Instead of computing, maybe take a known quartic. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 6x² + 4x. Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x + 4. Let&#x27;s check the roots of f’(x). Maybe this cubic has three real roots. Alternatively, use f(x) = x⁴ - 3x³ - 3x² + 4x + 1. Not sure. Alternatively, take f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4), but that would have four real roots, but its derivative would have three critical points. However, expanding this would be time-consuming.

Alternatively, take a quartic with two minima at different heights. Suppose f(x) has a local minimum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0, a local maximum at x = 1 with f(1) = 2, and another local minimum at x = 2 with f(2) = 1. Then, the function would go from +infty down to 0 at x = 0, up to 2 at x = 1, down to 1 at x = 2, and back up to +infty. In this case, m₁ = 0, M = 2, m₃ = 1. Then, for k between m₁ = 0 and m₃ = 1, the equation f(x) = k would have three distinct real roots: one left of 0, one between 0 and 1, and one between 1 and 2. For k between m₃ = 1 and M = 2, four distinct real roots. For k = 1, three real roots (double root at x = 2 and two others). For k = 0, three real roots (double root at x = 0 and one other). For k = 2, three real roots (double root at x = 1 and two others). For k &lt; 0, two real roots; for k &gt; 2, two real roots.

Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k between 0 and 1 (the two minima) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric case, even though the minima are equal, there&#x27;s still a k = M where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots (with a double root at the local maximum). Wait, no. In the symmetric case, k = M is the local maximum. For example, in f(x) = x⁴ - 4x², the local maximum is at x = 0 with k = 0. The equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, even in the symmetric case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k (specifically k = M) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Even though one of them is a double root, but the roots are still distinct in terms of their x-values. Wait, no. A double root at x = 0 means that x = 0 is a repeated root, but the distinct roots are x = -2, x = 0, x = 2. Therefore, three distinct real roots. The multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect the distinctness. Therefore, even if there is a multiple root, as long as there are three separate x-values, it&#x27;s three distinct real roots. Therefore, in both symmetric and asymmetric cases, statement (b) holds.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) with real coefficients, we know that its derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) has three distinct real roots. This implies that \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum (since the leading coefficient is positive, the polynomial tends to \( +\infty \) as \( x \to \pm\infty \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Critical Points and Graph Shape**:
   - The polynomial \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum.
   - The graph of \( f(x) \) will have a &quot;W&quot; shape with two local minima and one local maximum.

2. **Behavior of \( f(x) = k \)**:
   - For \( k \) values greater than the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local maximum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the local maximum and the higher local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has four real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to either local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local minimum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the two local minima, \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - For \( k \) values less than the lower local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.

3. **Evaluation of Statements**:
   - **(a)** False: There is no \( k \) such that \( f(x) = k \) has exactly one real root.
   - **(b)** True: There exists a \( k \) (between the two local minima) where \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - **(c)** False: \( f(x) = k \) does not always have four distinct real roots (e.g., for \( k \) outside the range between the local minima and maximum).
   - **(d)** False: \( f(x) = k \) can have four real roots for some \( k \), so it does not always have two real and two complex roots.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is \(\boxed{B}\).          </p>

Response: I really like choices (a) and (b). For (a) suppose $f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$. By three distinct real roots there always exists a new linear polynomial $g(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 +cx+d$, which must have a real root. Then, $f(x) = \frac{g(x)}{x}$. Thus, $f(x) = k$ must have one real root for some constant $k$ (just write $k = \frac{g(x_0)}{x_0}$ where $x_0$ is the real root of $g(x)$). \boxed{a}          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out which of the statements (a), (b), (c), or (d) is true given that the polynomial f(x) = x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d has a derivative f’(x) with three distinct real roots. Let me start by recalling some calculus and polynomial theory.

First, since f(x) is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, its derivative f’(x) is a cubic (degree 3) polynomial. The problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. That means the derivative has three distinct critical points where the slope of f(x) is zero. For a cubic polynomial to have three distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive, but I might not need to compute that here. The key takeaway is that the original function f(x) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum, or two local maxima and one local minimum. Since the derivative is a cubic with three real roots, it must alternate between increasing and decreasing appropriately.

Now, the graph of a quartic polynomial typically has a &quot;W&quot; shape or an &quot;M&quot; shape depending on the leading coefficient. Since the leading term here is x⁴, which has a positive coefficient, as x approaches positive or negative infinity, f(x) tends to positive infinity. Therefore, the graph will eventually rise on both ends. Given that the derivative has three real roots, there are three critical points. For a quartic with positive leading coefficient, the typical shape with three critical points would be two local minima and one local maximum in between. So, the graph would go up, then down, then up, then down, then up again? Wait, no. Wait, the derivative is cubic, so it can have three critical points. So the original function f(x) will have three turning points. Since it&#x27;s a quartic, it can have up to three turning points (since the derivative is cubic, which can have up to three roots). So with three critical points, the graph of f(x) will have two local minima and one local maximum, or two maxima and one minima. But given that the leading coefficient is positive, as x approaches ±∞, f(x) goes to +∞. Therefore, the rightmost and leftmost critical points must be minima. So the structure would be: starting from the left, the function decreases to a local maximum, then increases to a local minimum, then decreases again to a local maximum, and then increases to infinity? Wait, that doesn&#x27;t make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if the derivative has three real roots, then the original function f(x) has three critical points. Let me label them as x₁ &lt; x₂ &lt; x₃. Since the leading term is positive, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, and the same as x approaches -infty. So, the rightmost critical point x₃ must be a local minimum (since after that, the function increases to infinity), and the leftmost critical point x₁ must be a local maximum (since coming from -infty, the function is decreasing until x₁, then starts increasing). Wait, no, that seems contradictory. Let me check:

If x approaches -infty, f(x) tends to +infty, so as we move from left to right (from -infty to +infty), the function starts at +infty, then at some point x₁ (the leftmost critical point) it might turn. If x₁ is a local maximum, then after x₁, the function decreases. Then, at x₂, another critical point, which would have to be a local minimum, so after x₂, the function increases again. Then at x₃, another critical point, which would be a local maximum, and then after x₃, the function decreases. But wait, but after x₃, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, which is a contradiction because if x₃ is a local maximum, then after x₃, the function should decrease, but it actually needs to increase to +infty. Therefore, that can&#x27;t be. Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the leftmost critical point x₁ is a local minimum. Let&#x27;s see: starting from -infty, f(x) is going to +infty. Then at x₁, which is a local minimum, the function starts increasing. Then at x₂, a local maximum, so after x₂, the function decreases. Then at x₃, another local minimum, so after x₃, the function increases again towards +infty. That makes sense. So the critical points are arranged as local minimum at x₁, local maximum at x₂, local minimum at x₃. Therefore, the graph has two local minima and one local maximum.

So the function f(x) would start at +infty, decrease to a local minimum at x₁, then increase to a local maximum at x₂, then decrease to a local minimum at x₃, and then increase again to +infty. So, the graph would look like a &quot;W&quot; but with the middle peak being a local maximum and the two valleys being local minima. So, the function has two local minima and one local maximum.

Given that structure, let&#x27;s consider the possible number of real roots for f(x) = k. Depending on the value of k, the horizontal line y = k can intersect the graph of f(x) in different ways.

If k is greater than the value of the local maximum at x₂, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃, because the function only exceeds k on the far left and far right.

If k is exactly equal to the value of the local maximum at x₂, then f(x) = k would have three real roots: one at x₂ (with multiplicity two, since it&#x27;s a local maximum) and one on each side (left of x₁ and right of x₃). But wait, if the local maximum is exactly at k, then the graph touches the line y = k at x₂, so that&#x27;s a double root, and crosses the line on either side. So three real roots, but one of them is a double root.

If k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two local minima, then suppose the local minima at x₁ and x₃ have values m₁ and m₃. Let&#x27;s assume that one of the minima is lower than the other. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, both minima must be below the local maximum. However, depending on the specific coefficients, one minimum could be lower than the other. Let&#x27;s say, without loss of generality, that m₁ &lt; m₃ (the left local minimum is lower than the right local minimum). Then, if k is between m₃ and the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots: two on the left side (between -infty and x₁, and between x₁ and x₂), and two on the right side (between x₂ and x₃, and between x₃ and +infty). Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two minima, say between M and m₃ (assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), then when k is in (m₃, M), the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. But actually, when you have two minima and one maximum, the graph goes from +infty to m₁ (local min), rises to M (local max), then falls to m₃ (local min), then rises again to +infty. So if k is between m₁ and M, then depending on where k is relative to m₃, the number of roots changes.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch a rough graph mentally. Starting from the left (x approaching -infty), f(x) is at +infty, decreases to m₁ at x₁ (local min), then increases to M at x₂ (local max), then decreases to m₃ at x₃ (local min), then increases back to +infty.

So, if k is greater than M, then the equation f(x) = k has two real roots: one on the far left and one on the far right.

If k is equal to M, then it has three real roots: one at x₂ (a double root) and one on each side.

If k is between m₃ and M, then it has four real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, one between x₂ and x₃, and one right of x₃.

If k is equal to m₃, then it has three real roots: one at x₃ (double root) and one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂.

If k is between m₁ and m₃, then it has two real roots: one left of x₁ and one right of x₃, because the horizontal line y = k only intersects the graph on the leftmost and rightmost ascending parts. Wait, but between x₁ and x₃, the function reaches a maximum at x₂, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, then the line y = k would cross the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. Wait, but if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the minima, but since m₁ is lower than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ to M, so it must cross y = k once there. Similarly, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then since m₃ is higher than m₁, and k is between m₁ and m₃, then on the interval x₂ to x₃, the function decreases from M to m₃, crossing y = k once. Similarly, on the interval x₃ to +infty, the function increases from m₃ to +infty, so y = k would cross once there. Similarly, on the interval -infty to x₁, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, crossing y = k once. Therefore, actually, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots. If k is equal to m₁, then it&#x27;s a double root at x₁ and another root on the right. Similarly, if k is equal to m₃, it&#x27;s a double root at x₃ and another root on the left. If k is less than m₁, since m₁ is the lower of the two minima, then the line y = k would intersect the graph only twice: once left of x₁ and once right of x₃. Wait, no. If k is less than m₁, which is the minimum, then the graph only reaches down to m₁, so y = k would not intersect the graph at all? Wait, no. Wait, as x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches +infty, and at x₁, it&#x27;s a local minimum m₁. So if k &lt; m₁, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃? Wait, but if k is less than m₁, which is the minimum value on the left side, then on the left side, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, so it must cross y = k once. On the right side, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is higher than m₁) up to +infty, so if k is less than m₁, then since m₃ is greater than m₁, and k is less than m₁, then on the right side, the function starts at m₃ (which is greater than k) and increases to infinity, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, if k &lt; m₁, there is only one real root on the left side. Similarly, if k &gt; M, there are two real roots on the extremes. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to tabulate the different cases.

Let me denote:

- The leftmost local minimum at x = x₁ with f(x₁) = m₁.

- The local maximum at x = x₂ with f(x₂) = M.

- The rightmost local minimum at x = x₃ with f(x₃) = m₃.

Assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ (since x₁ &lt; x₃ and the function might have asymmetrical minima), though it could also be m₃ &lt; m₁. Wait, but since the function is going from m₁ up to M, then down to m₃, and then up again. The relative positions of m₁ and m₃ depend on the specific coefficients. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify, so I can&#x27;t assume which is lower. Therefore, perhaps I need to consider both possibilities. But maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter. Let&#x27;s suppose m₁ ≤ m₃ for definiteness. Then:

- If k &gt; M: two real roots (left and right).

- If k = M: three real roots (one double root at x₂ and two simple roots on the sides).

- If m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots (left, between x₁ and x₂, between x₂ and x₃, right).

- If k = m₃: three real roots (double root at x₃ and two others).

- If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: four real roots (similar to above? Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, but the function between x₁ and x₂ goes up to M, which is higher than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function crosses y = k once (since it goes from m₁ to M), between x₂ and x₃, it crosses once (since it goes from M to m₃), and on both ends, left of x₁ and right of x₃, the function is above k? Wait, no. Wait, the left end (x approaching -infty) is +infty, so coming from the left, the function starts at +infty, decreases to m₁ (which is less than k, since k &gt; m₁), so it must cross y = k once on the left side (before x₁). Then, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross there. Wait, but m₃ is greater than k, so after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so if m₃ &gt; k, then it never crosses y = k again. Therefore, in this case, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k has three real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, and one between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought.

Wait, perhaps I need to more carefully analyze:

Case 1: k &gt; M. Then, the horizontal line y = k cuts the graph at two points: one far left (before x₁) and one far right (after x₃).

Case 2: k = M. The line touches the local maximum at x₂ and cuts the graph on the left and right sides, resulting in three real roots (one double root at x₂).

Case 3: m₃ &lt; k &lt; M. The line y = k intersects the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃.

Wait, but if m₃ is the right local minimum, and k is greater than m₃ but less than M, then after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so since k &gt; m₃, there will be a crossing right of x₃. Similarly, left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is less than k (since k &gt; m₃ and m₃ &gt; m₁, so k &gt; m₁). Therefore, left of x₁, the function crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ (which is less than k) up to M (which is greater than k), so crosses once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is less than k), so crosses once. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to infinity, crossing once. Therefore, four crossings. So that&#x27;s four real roots.

Case 4: k = m₃. The line touches the local minimum at x₃, so it&#x27;s a double root there, and crosses the graph left of x₁ and between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so at k = m₃, it only touches at x₃. Therefore, the roots would be left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂ (since the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing k = m₃ if m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), but wait, m₃ is the value at x₃, which is a local minimum. If k = m₃, then between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so it reaches m₃ at x₃. Therefore, if k = m₃, then there&#x27;s a root at x₃ (double root) and another root left of x₁ (since the function decreases from +infty to m₁, which is less than m₃, so crosses y = m₃ once left of x₁) and another root between x₁ and x₂ (as the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing y = m₃ once). So total of three roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and a double root at x₃.

Case 5: m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃. Here, k is between the two local minima. Since m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum. Let&#x27;s assume m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph as follows:

- Left of x₁: the function comes down from +infty to m₁, which is less than k, so it crosses y = k once.

- Between x₁ and x₂: the function goes from m₁ (less than k) up to M (greater than k), so crosses once.

- Between x₂ and x₃: the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so crosses once.

- Right of x₃: the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = k there.

Therefore, total of three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃.

Wait, but hold on. If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃, then m₃ is greater than k, so right of x₃, the function starts at m₃ and goes up, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, only three real roots? But earlier, when k is between m₃ and M, we had four roots. Hmm.

Case 6: k = m₁. The line touches the left local minimum at x₁, resulting in a double root there. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than m₁), so if k = m₁, which is less than m₃, the function crosses y = k once between x₂ and x₃. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ to +infty, which is above k, so no crossing. Also, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M, so crosses y = k once. Wait, but if k = m₁, then between x₁ and x₂, the function starts at m₁ (k) and goes up, so the crossing is exactly at x₁, which is a double root. Then, another crossing between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, three real roots: double root at x₁ and single roots between x₂ and x₃ and right of x₃? Wait, no. Wait, if k = m₁, then at x₁, the function has a local minimum. So the graph touches y = k at x₁, and then goes up. On the left side, as x approaches -infty, the function approaches +infty, so it comes down from +infty to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, left of x₁, there&#x27;s no crossing since it&#x27;s decreasing to m₁. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root because it&#x27;s a local minimum). Then, moving from x₁ to x₂, the function increases to M, which is greater than m₁, so there&#x27;s no crossing there. Then, from x₂ to x₃, the function decreases to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Then, from x₃ to +infty, the function increases to +infty, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = m₁ again. Therefore, total of two real roots: a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but the original function at x approaching -infty is +infty, so when approaching from the left, the function decreases to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, for k = m₁, the leftmost intersection is exactly at x₁ (a double root), and then another intersection between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, two real roots (one double, one single). But in the context of the problem, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot; or &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, do they count multiplicity? The problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for option (a). If they count multiplicity, then at k = m₁, f(x) = k has two real roots (one double, one single). If they don&#x27;t count multiplicity, then maybe it&#x27;s considered as two real roots (but one is a double root). Wait, the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;. So if multiplicity is considered, then a double root would count as one root, but actually, in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s still one. Wait, no. Wait, multiplicity is about the number of roots counting multiplicity. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, which might mean exactly one distinct real root, or exactly one real root counting multiplicity. The question is ambiguous, but in standard terminology, &quot;exactly one real root&quot; usually refers to exactly one distinct real root, but in some contexts, it might count multiplicity. However, in options (b) and (c), they mention &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; and &quot;four distinct real roots&quot;, so it seems like they are distinguishing between distinct roots and multiple roots. Therefore, for (a), &quot;exactly one real root&quot; probably means exactly one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. Similarly, for (b), &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;. So in the case where k = m₁, we have a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃, so that&#x27;s two distinct real roots (x₁ with multiplicity two and another root). Therefore, (a) is not satisfied here.

Case 7: k &lt; m₁. Then, the horizontal line y = k is below both local minima. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, the line y = k would intersect the graph twice: once on the far left (before x₁) and once on the far right (after x₃). Therefore, two real roots.

So summarizing:

- k &gt; M: two real roots.

- k = M: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots.

- k = m₃: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: three real roots.

- k = m₁: three real roots (one double, two simple? Wait, earlier analysis said two roots, but maybe I messed up).

Wait, let me re-examine k = m₁. If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root) and since between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, total of two distinct real roots: x₁ (double) and one between x₂ and x₃. So, in terms of distinct roots, two; in terms of total roots counting multiplicity, three. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for (a). If &quot;exactly one&quot; means one distinct root, then even if it&#x27;s a double root, that would still be considered one real root. But in standard terminology, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, they usually mean one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. However, in the case of k = M, we have three real roots but one is a double root. The problem&#x27;s option (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, so distinctness is important there. So, for (a), if there exists a k where f(x) = k has exactly one real root (distinct or not?), the answer depends on that.

But in the case where k is less than m₁, we have two distinct real roots. If k is equal to m₁, we have two real roots (x₁ is a double root, and another one). If k is between m₁ and m₃, three real roots. If k is equal to m₃ or M, three real roots (with a double root). If k is between m₃ and M, four real roots. If k is greater than M, two real roots.

Wait, but in none of these cases do we have exactly one real root. Even when k is less than m₁, we have two real roots. When k equals m₁ or m₃ or M, we have two or three real roots but with multiplicities. So, there is no k for which f(x) = k has exactly one real root, right? Unless when the polynomial is tangent to the line y = k at one point and doesn&#x27;t cross it elsewhere, but given the shape of the quartic, which tends to +infty on both sides, if the horizontal line is tangent at the local maximum or one of the minima, it will still cross the graph on one side or the other. Wait, for example, if k is equal to the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = M has a double root at x₂ and two other roots on the left and right. Wait, no. Wait, at k = M, the horizontal line touches the local maximum at x₂. To the left of x₂, the function is increasing from m₁ to M, so it only reaches M at x₂. To the right of x₂, the function decreases from M to m₃ and then increases again. Therefore, the line y = M would intersect the graph only at x₂ (a double root) and on the right side as the function increases past M again? Wait, no. Wait, after x₃, the function increases from m₃ to +infty. If M is the local maximum, then m₃ is less than M. So, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is less than M) up to +infty, so it must cross y = M once after x₃. Similarly, to the left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁ (which is less than M), so it must cross y = M once before x₁. Therefore, when k = M, the equation f(x) = M has three real roots: one at x₂ (double root) and one on each side. Therefore, three distinct real roots? Wait, but x₂ is a double root, so in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s three: x₂, and one on each side. So multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect distinctness. Therefore, even though x₂ is a double root, it&#x27;s still one distinct root. So in that case, k = M gives three distinct real roots, with one of them being a double root. Wait, no. If a root is a double root, it&#x27;s still a single distinct root; the distinctness refers to the x-values. So x₂ is one distinct root, and the other two are also distinct. So in total, three distinct real roots, one with multiplicity two. Therefore, for the problem&#x27;s option (b): &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Well, when k = M or k = m₁ or k = m₃, you have three real roots, but with one double root. But the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would require all three roots to be distinct, i.e., no multiple roots. So in that case, even though at k = M you have three real roots, one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. Therefore, the answer would be that statement (b) is false. Wait, but when k is between m₃ and M, we have four distinct real roots. When k is between m₁ and m₃, three distinct real roots. When k is less than m₁ or greater than M, two distinct real roots. When k equals M, m₁, or m₃, three real roots with one double root.

Therefore, the statement (b) says: &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Given that when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three distinct real roots (as per the earlier analysis). Wait, earlier I thought when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three real roots. Wait, let&#x27;s recheck.

Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two local minima, then depending on the graph, how does the horizontal line intersect? Suppose m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum, with m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, k between m₁ and m₃ would be above m₁ and below m₃. Then, on the left side (x &lt; x₁), the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is below k, so it crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is above k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross. Therefore, three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots because they are in different intervals. Therefore, statement (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima, we get three distinct real roots. Additionally, if m₁ &gt; m₃, then similar logic applies, just switch left and right.

Therefore, regardless of the relative positions of the minima, there exists a k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Therefore, option (b) is true.

But wait, the answer options are (a), (b), (c), (d). Let&#x27;s check the options again:

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

From the analysis above:

- (a) is false because for any real k, f(x) = k has either two, three, or four real roots. There is no k where it has exactly one real root.

- (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima (or between the higher local minimum and the local maximum, but actually in our case, between m₁ and m₃, assuming m₁ &lt; m₃), the equation f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

Wait, earlier, when k is between m₁ and m₃, which are both minima, the horizontal line y = k intersects the graph three times: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots.

- (c) is false because when k is greater than M or less than m₁ (the lower of the two minima), f(x) = k has only two real roots.

- (d) is false because when k is between the two local minima or between a local minimum and the local maximum, f(x) = k has four or three real roots, respectively, so not always two real and two complex roots.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

But wait, the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, and the options are (a)-(d). The analysis above suggests that (b) is true. However, in the initial problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots. Wait, but in our analysis, we concluded that between the two local minima, we can get three real roots. But the key is that the quartic has three critical points: two minima and one maximum or two maxima and one minima, but in this case, with leading coefficient positive, it&#x27;s two minima and one maximum.

But let me verify with an example. Take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x + 1. Wait, maybe a simpler example. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 2x³ - 3x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 6x² - 6x. Let&#x27;s find the critical points.

Wait, maybe a better example is f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has three real roots: x = 0, x = sqrt(2), x = -sqrt(2). So the critical points are at x = -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). Then f(x) at these points: f(-sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(2))⁴ - 4*(sqrt(2))² = 4 - 8 = -4. f(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. f(sqrt(2)) = same as f(-sqrt(2)) = -4. So the local minima are at x = ±sqrt(2) with f(x) = -4, and the local maximum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0. So this is a symmetric quartic. Then, for k between -4 and 0, f(x) = k has four real roots. For k = 0, it has three real roots (double root at x = 0 and two at ±sqrt(something)). For k &lt; -4, two real roots. For k &gt; 0, two real roots. For k between the minima and the maximum (i.e., between -4 and 0), four real roots. For k exactly at -4, three real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). Wait, but in this case, the two minima are equal. So here, m₁ = m₃ = -4. Therefore, there is no interval between m₁ and m₃; they are the same. Therefore, in this symmetric case, when k is between -4 and 0, you get four real roots, but when k is exactly -4, you get two real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). However, the original problem states that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does: -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). So in this case, the two minima are equal. Therefore, if the two local minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are equal), so the three real roots case doesn&#x27;t occur. Wait, but the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; for f’(x). In this example, f’(x) has three distinct real roots. But in this case, the minima are equal, so between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, you get four real roots. But if the minima are not equal, then between them, you would have three real roots.

Therefore, the key is whether the two local minima can be at different heights. If f’(x) has three distinct real roots, but the function f(x) could still have two equal minima. Wait, but in the example above, even with symmetric critical points, the minima are equal. So perhaps, depending on the coefficients, the minima can be equal or not. Therefore, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether the minima are equal or not, only that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Therefore, in some cases, you might have equal minima, in others not. Therefore, the answer would depend on whether, regardless of the specific f(x) meeting the condition, statement (b) is always true.

But wait, in the example where minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are the same), so the three real roots case would not exist. However, in that case, when k is between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, which is the same as saying between m and M, you get four real roots. When k is less than m or greater than M, you get two real roots. When k equals m, you get two double roots. When k equals M, you get three real roots (a double root and two simple roots). Therefore, in the symmetric case, statement (b) is false because there is no k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. When k = M, you have three real roots but one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. When k is between m and M, you have four distinct real roots. When k is less than m, two distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric case, statement (b) is false. But the problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does, but the minima are equal. Therefore, the correct answer would not always be (b). Therefore, my previous analysis was incorrect.

Therefore, there&#x27;s a problem: if the quartic is symmetric, with two equal minima, then there is no k for which f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) would not hold in such cases. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot; given that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Since there exist such polynomials where statement (b) is false, but there also exist polynomials where statement (b) is true. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the statement must hold for all such polynomials or if there exists at least one. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, implying that the statement must be always true given the conditions.

Therefore, since there exists a polynomial where f’(x) has three distinct real roots but there&#x27;s no k with three distinct real roots (like the symmetric quartic example), statement (b) is not always true. Therefore, my previous conclusion was wrong.

Then, what is the correct answer? Let&#x27;s re-examine the options.

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

In the symmetric example, the only possible numbers of real roots are two (k &lt; m), four (m &lt; k &lt; M), three (k = m or k = M), or two (k &gt; M). So in this case, there is no k with exactly one real root. Therefore, statement (a) is false.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric example, when k = m or k = M, we have three real roots but with a double root, so they are not distinct. Therefore, in this case, there is no k with three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) is false.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

False, since for k &gt; M or k &lt; m, there are only two real roots.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

False, since for some k, there are four real roots.

Therefore, in this case, none of the options are true? But that can&#x27;t be, because the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the symmetric example. Let&#x27;s take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has roots at x = 0, sqrt(2), -sqrt(2). So three distinct real roots. The function f(x) = x⁴ - 4x² has local maxima at x = 0 (f(0) = 0) and local minima at x = ±sqrt(2) (f(±sqrt(2)) = -4). Then, for k = -4, the equation f(x) = -4 has double roots at x = ±sqrt(2). For k = 0, it has a double root at x = 0 and simple roots at x = ±2. So, in this case, when k = 0, the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. Therefore, three real roots, but only two distinct ones (x = 0 and x = ±2). Wait, no. If x = ±2 are roots, then total roots are x = 0 (double), x = 2, and x = -2. So four roots total, but with x = 0 counted twice. However, the equation x⁴ - 4x² = 0 factors as x²(x² - 4) = 0, so roots at x = 0 (multiplicity 2), x = 2, x = -2. So in this case, for k = 0, there are three distinct real roots (0, 2, -2), with one of them being a double root. Therefore, in terms of distinct real roots, it&#x27;s three. So, statement (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would be true here because even though 0 is a double root, the roots are still distinct: -2, 0, 2. So in this case, k = 0 gives three distinct real roots, even with a double root at 0. Therefore, perhaps in this example, statement (b) is true.

Wait, but if we take k = -4, then f(x) = -4 has roots at x = ±sqrt(2), each with multiplicity two. So, two distinct real roots, each a double root. Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is not satisfied for k = -4, but for k = 0, we have three distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric example, there does exist a k (specifically k = 0) such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) is true.

But earlier, I thought that when the minima are equal, there&#x27;s no k between them, but in reality, even in the symmetric case, there is a k (the local maximum) where you have three distinct real roots. So regardless of whether the minima are equal or not, the local maximum will always provide a k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Let me check.

In the symmetric example, at k = 0 (the local maximum), the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double root) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) holds.

If we take another example where the minima are not equal. Let’s construct a quartic with two unequal minima. For example, f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x. Compute its derivative: f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x² + 4x + 4. I need to check if this derivative has three distinct real roots. Instead of computing, maybe take a known quartic. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 6x² + 4x. Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x + 4. Let&#x27;s check the roots of f’(x). Maybe this cubic has three real roots. Alternatively, use f(x) = x⁴ - 3x³ - 3x² + 4x + 1. Not sure. Alternatively, take f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4), but that would have four real roots, but its derivative would have three critical points. However, expanding this would be time-consuming.

Alternatively, take a quartic with two minima at different heights. Suppose f(x) has a local minimum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0, a local maximum at x = 1 with f(1) = 2, and another local minimum at x = 2 with f(2) = 1. Then, the function would go from +infty down to 0 at x = 0, up to 2 at x = 1, down to 1 at x = 2, and back up to +infty. In this case, m₁ = 0, M = 2, m₃ = 1. Then, for k between m₁ = 0 and m₃ = 1, the equation f(x) = k would have three distinct real roots: one left of 0, one between 0 and 1, and one between 1 and 2. For k between m₃ = 1 and M = 2, four distinct real roots. For k = 1, three real roots (double root at x = 2 and two others). For k = 0, three real roots (double root at x = 0 and one other). For k = 2, three real roots (double root at x = 1 and two others). For k &lt; 0, two real roots; for k &gt; 2, two real roots.

Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k between 0 and 1 (the two minima) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric case, even though the minima are equal, there&#x27;s still a k = M where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots (with a double root at the local maximum). Wait, no. In the symmetric case, k = M is the local maximum. For example, in f(x) = x⁴ - 4x², the local maximum is at x = 0 with k = 0. The equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, even in the symmetric case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k (specifically k = M) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Even though one of them is a double root, but the roots are still distinct in terms of their x-values. Wait, no. A double root at x = 0 means that x = 0 is a repeated root, but the distinct roots are x = -2, x = 0, x = 2. Therefore, three distinct real roots. The multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect the distinctness. Therefore, even if there is a multiple root, as long as there are three separate x-values, it&#x27;s three distinct real roots. Therefore, in both symmetric and asymmetric cases, statement (b) holds.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) with real coefficients, we know that its derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) has three distinct real roots. This implies that \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum (since the leading coefficient is positive, the polynomial tends to \( +\infty \) as \( x \to \pm\infty \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Critical Points and Graph Shape**:
   - The polynomial \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum.
   - The graph of \( f(x) \) will have a &quot;W&quot; shape with two local minima and one local maximum.

2. **Behavior of \( f(x) = k \)**:
   - For \( k \) values greater than the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local maximum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the local maximum and the higher local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has four real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to either local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local minimum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the two local minima, \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - For \( k \) values less than the lower local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.

3. **Evaluation of Statements**:
   - **(a)** False: There is no \( k \) such that \( f(x) = k \) has exactly one real root.
   - **(b)** True: There exists a \( k \) (between the two local minima) where \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - **(c)** False: \( f(x) = k \) does not always have four distinct real roots (e.g., for \( k \) outside the range between the local minima and maximum).
   - **(d)** False: \( f(x) = k \) can have four real roots for some \( k \), so it does not always have two real and two complex roots.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out which of the statements (a), (b), (c), or (d) is true given that the polynomial f(x) = x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d has a derivative f’(x) with three distinct real roots. Let me start by recalling some calculus and polynomial theory.

First, since f(x) is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, its derivative f’(x) is a cubic (degree 3) polynomial. The problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. That means the derivative has three distinct critical points where the slope of f(x) is zero. For a cubic polynomial to have three distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive, but I might not need to compute that here. The key takeaway is that the original function f(x) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum, or two local maxima and one local minimum. Since the derivative is a cubic with three real roots, it must alternate between increasing and decreasing appropriately.

Now, the graph of a quartic polynomial typically has a &quot;W&quot; shape or an &quot;M&quot; shape depending on the leading coefficient. Since the leading term here is x⁴, which has a positive coefficient, as x approaches positive or negative infinity, f(x) tends to positive infinity. Therefore, the graph will eventually rise on both ends. Given that the derivative has three real roots, there are three critical points. For a quartic with positive leading coefficient, the typical shape with three critical points would be two local minima and one local maximum in between. So, the graph would go up, then down, then up, then down, then up again? Wait, no. Wait, the derivative is cubic, so it can have three critical points. So the original function f(x) will have three turning points. Since it&#x27;s a quartic, it can have up to three turning points (since the derivative is cubic, which can have up to three roots). So with three critical points, the graph of f(x) will have two local minima and one local maximum, or two maxima and one minima. But given that the leading coefficient is positive, as x approaches ±∞, f(x) goes to +∞. Therefore, the rightmost and leftmost critical points must be minima. So the structure would be: starting from the left, the function decreases to a local maximum, then increases to a local minimum, then decreases again to a local maximum, and then increases to infinity? Wait, that doesn&#x27;t make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if the derivative has three real roots, then the original function f(x) has three critical points. Let me label them as x₁ &lt; x₂ &lt; x₃. Since the leading term is positive, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, and the same as x approaches -infty. So, the rightmost critical point x₃ must be a local minimum (since after that, the function increases to infinity), and the leftmost critical point x₁ must be a local maximum (since coming from -infty, the function is decreasing until x₁, then starts increasing). Wait, no, that seems contradictory. Let me check:

If x approaches -infty, f(x) tends to +infty, so as we move from left to right (from -infty to +infty), the function starts at +infty, then at some point x₁ (the leftmost critical point) it might turn. If x₁ is a local maximum, then after x₁, the function decreases. Then, at x₂, another critical point, which would have to be a local minimum, so after x₂, the function increases again. Then at x₃, another critical point, which would be a local maximum, and then after x₃, the function decreases. But wait, but after x₃, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, which is a contradiction because if x₃ is a local maximum, then after x₃, the function should decrease, but it actually needs to increase to +infty. Therefore, that can&#x27;t be. Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the leftmost critical point x₁ is a local minimum. Let&#x27;s see: starting from -infty, f(x) is going to +infty. Then at x₁, which is a local minimum, the function starts increasing. Then at x₂, a local maximum, so after x₂, the function decreases. Then at x₃, another local minimum, so after x₃, the function increases again towards +infty. That makes sense. So the critical points are arranged as local minimum at x₁, local maximum at x₂, local minimum at x₃. Therefore, the graph has two local minima and one local maximum.

So the function f(x) would start at +infty, decrease to a local minimum at x₁, then increase to a local maximum at x₂, then decrease to a local minimum at x₃, and then increase again to +infty. So, the graph would look like a &quot;W&quot; but with the middle peak being a local maximum and the two valleys being local minima. So, the function has two local minima and one local maximum.

Given that structure, let&#x27;s consider the possible number of real roots for f(x) = k. Depending on the value of k, the horizontal line y = k can intersect the graph of f(x) in different ways.

If k is greater than the value of the local maximum at x₂, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃, because the function only exceeds k on the far left and far right.

If k is exactly equal to the value of the local maximum at x₂, then f(x) = k would have three real roots: one at x₂ (with multiplicity two, since it&#x27;s a local maximum) and one on each side (left of x₁ and right of x₃). But wait, if the local maximum is exactly at k, then the graph touches the line y = k at x₂, so that&#x27;s a double root, and crosses the line on either side. So three real roots, but one of them is a double root.

If k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two local minima, then suppose the local minima at x₁ and x₃ have values m₁ and m₃. Let&#x27;s assume that one of the minima is lower than the other. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, both minima must be below the local maximum. However, depending on the specific coefficients, one minimum could be lower than the other. Let&#x27;s say, without loss of generality, that m₁ &lt; m₃ (the left local minimum is lower than the right local minimum). Then, if k is between m₃ and the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots: two on the left side (between -infty and x₁, and between x₁ and x₂), and two on the right side (between x₂ and x₃, and between x₃ and +infty). Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two minima, say between M and m₃ (assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), then when k is in (m₃, M), the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. But actually, when you have two minima and one maximum, the graph goes from +infty to m₁ (local min), rises to M (local max), then falls to m₃ (local min), then rises again to +infty. So if k is between m₁ and M, then depending on where k is relative to m₃, the number of roots changes.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch a rough graph mentally. Starting from the left (x approaching -infty), f(x) is at +infty, decreases to m₁ at x₁ (local min), then increases to M at x₂ (local max), then decreases to m₃ at x₃ (local min), then increases back to +infty.

So, if k is greater than M, then the equation f(x) = k has two real roots: one on the far left and one on the far right.

If k is equal to M, then it has three real roots: one at x₂ (a double root) and one on each side.

If k is between m₃ and M, then it has four real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, one between x₂ and x₃, and one right of x₃.

If k is equal to m₃, then it has three real roots: one at x₃ (double root) and one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂.

If k is between m₁ and m₃, then it has two real roots: one left of x₁ and one right of x₃, because the horizontal line y = k only intersects the graph on the leftmost and rightmost ascending parts. Wait, but between x₁ and x₃, the function reaches a maximum at x₂, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, then the line y = k would cross the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. Wait, but if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the minima, but since m₁ is lower than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ to M, so it must cross y = k once there. Similarly, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then since m₃ is higher than m₁, and k is between m₁ and m₃, then on the interval x₂ to x₃, the function decreases from M to m₃, crossing y = k once. Similarly, on the interval x₃ to +infty, the function increases from m₃ to +infty, so y = k would cross once there. Similarly, on the interval -infty to x₁, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, crossing y = k once. Therefore, actually, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots. If k is equal to m₁, then it&#x27;s a double root at x₁ and another root on the right. Similarly, if k is equal to m₃, it&#x27;s a double root at x₃ and another root on the left. If k is less than m₁, since m₁ is the lower of the two minima, then the line y = k would intersect the graph only twice: once left of x₁ and once right of x₃. Wait, no. If k is less than m₁, which is the minimum, then the graph only reaches down to m₁, so y = k would not intersect the graph at all? Wait, no. Wait, as x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches +infty, and at x₁, it&#x27;s a local minimum m₁. So if k &lt; m₁, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃? Wait, but if k is less than m₁, which is the minimum value on the left side, then on the left side, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, so it must cross y = k once. On the right side, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is higher than m₁) up to +infty, so if k is less than m₁, then since m₃ is greater than m₁, and k is less than m₁, then on the right side, the function starts at m₃ (which is greater than k) and increases to infinity, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, if k &lt; m₁, there is only one real root on the left side. Similarly, if k &gt; M, there are two real roots on the extremes. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to tabulate the different cases.

Let me denote:

- The leftmost local minimum at x = x₁ with f(x₁) = m₁.

- The local maximum at x = x₂ with f(x₂) = M.

- The rightmost local minimum at x = x₃ with f(x₃) = m₃.

Assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ (since x₁ &lt; x₃ and the function might have asymmetrical minima), though it could also be m₃ &lt; m₁. Wait, but since the function is going from m₁ up to M, then down to m₃, and then up again. The relative positions of m₁ and m₃ depend on the specific coefficients. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify, so I can&#x27;t assume which is lower. Therefore, perhaps I need to consider both possibilities. But maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter. Let&#x27;s suppose m₁ ≤ m₃ for definiteness. Then:

- If k &gt; M: two real roots (left and right).

- If k = M: three real roots (one double root at x₂ and two simple roots on the sides).

- If m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots (left, between x₁ and x₂, between x₂ and x₃, right).

- If k = m₃: three real roots (double root at x₃ and two others).

- If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: four real roots (similar to above? Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, but the function between x₁ and x₂ goes up to M, which is higher than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function crosses y = k once (since it goes from m₁ to M), between x₂ and x₃, it crosses once (since it goes from M to m₃), and on both ends, left of x₁ and right of x₃, the function is above k? Wait, no. Wait, the left end (x approaching -infty) is +infty, so coming from the left, the function starts at +infty, decreases to m₁ (which is less than k, since k &gt; m₁), so it must cross y = k once on the left side (before x₁). Then, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross there. Wait, but m₃ is greater than k, so after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so if m₃ &gt; k, then it never crosses y = k again. Therefore, in this case, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k has three real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, and one between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought.

Wait, perhaps I need to more carefully analyze:

Case 1: k &gt; M. Then, the horizontal line y = k cuts the graph at two points: one far left (before x₁) and one far right (after x₃).

Case 2: k = M. The line touches the local maximum at x₂ and cuts the graph on the left and right sides, resulting in three real roots (one double root at x₂).

Case 3: m₃ &lt; k &lt; M. The line y = k intersects the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃.

Wait, but if m₃ is the right local minimum, and k is greater than m₃ but less than M, then after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so since k &gt; m₃, there will be a crossing right of x₃. Similarly, left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is less than k (since k &gt; m₃ and m₃ &gt; m₁, so k &gt; m₁). Therefore, left of x₁, the function crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ (which is less than k) up to M (which is greater than k), so crosses once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is less than k), so crosses once. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to infinity, crossing once. Therefore, four crossings. So that&#x27;s four real roots.

Case 4: k = m₃. The line touches the local minimum at x₃, so it&#x27;s a double root there, and crosses the graph left of x₁ and between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so at k = m₃, it only touches at x₃. Therefore, the roots would be left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂ (since the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing k = m₃ if m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), but wait, m₃ is the value at x₃, which is a local minimum. If k = m₃, then between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so it reaches m₃ at x₃. Therefore, if k = m₃, then there&#x27;s a root at x₃ (double root) and another root left of x₁ (since the function decreases from +infty to m₁, which is less than m₃, so crosses y = m₃ once left of x₁) and another root between x₁ and x₂ (as the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing y = m₃ once). So total of three roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and a double root at x₃.

Case 5: m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃. Here, k is between the two local minima. Since m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum. Let&#x27;s assume m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph as follows:

- Left of x₁: the function comes down from +infty to m₁, which is less than k, so it crosses y = k once.

- Between x₁ and x₂: the function goes from m₁ (less than k) up to M (greater than k), so crosses once.

- Between x₂ and x₃: the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so crosses once.

- Right of x₃: the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = k there.

Therefore, total of three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃.

Wait, but hold on. If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃, then m₃ is greater than k, so right of x₃, the function starts at m₃ and goes up, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, only three real roots? But earlier, when k is between m₃ and M, we had four roots. Hmm.

Case 6: k = m₁. The line touches the left local minimum at x₁, resulting in a double root there. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than m₁), so if k = m₁, which is less than m₃, the function crosses y = k once between x₂ and x₃. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ to +infty, which is above k, so no crossing. Also, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M, so crosses y = k once. Wait, but if k = m₁, then between x₁ and x₂, the function starts at m₁ (k) and goes up, so the crossing is exactly at x₁, which is a double root. Then, another crossing between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, three real roots: double root at x₁ and single roots between x₂ and x₃ and right of x₃? Wait, no. Wait, if k = m₁, then at x₁, the function has a local minimum. So the graph touches y = k at x₁, and then goes up. On the left side, as x approaches -infty, the function approaches +infty, so it comes down from +infty to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, left of x₁, there&#x27;s no crossing since it&#x27;s decreasing to m₁. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root because it&#x27;s a local minimum). Then, moving from x₁ to x₂, the function increases to M, which is greater than m₁, so there&#x27;s no crossing there. Then, from x₂ to x₃, the function decreases to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Then, from x₃ to +infty, the function increases to +infty, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = m₁ again. Therefore, total of two real roots: a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but the original function at x approaching -infty is +infty, so when approaching from the left, the function decreases to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, for k = m₁, the leftmost intersection is exactly at x₁ (a double root), and then another intersection between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, two real roots (one double, one single). But in the context of the problem, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot; or &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, do they count multiplicity? The problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for option (a). If they count multiplicity, then at k = m₁, f(x) = k has two real roots (one double, one single). If they don&#x27;t count multiplicity, then maybe it&#x27;s considered as two real roots (but one is a double root). Wait, the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;. So if multiplicity is considered, then a double root would count as one root, but actually, in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s still one. Wait, no. Wait, multiplicity is about the number of roots counting multiplicity. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, which might mean exactly one distinct real root, or exactly one real root counting multiplicity. The question is ambiguous, but in standard terminology, &quot;exactly one real root&quot; usually refers to exactly one distinct real root, but in some contexts, it might count multiplicity. However, in options (b) and (c), they mention &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; and &quot;four distinct real roots&quot;, so it seems like they are distinguishing between distinct roots and multiple roots. Therefore, for (a), &quot;exactly one real root&quot; probably means exactly one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. Similarly, for (b), &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;. So in the case where k = m₁, we have a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃, so that&#x27;s two distinct real roots (x₁ with multiplicity two and another root). Therefore, (a) is not satisfied here.

Case 7: k &lt; m₁. Then, the horizontal line y = k is below both local minima. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, the line y = k would intersect the graph twice: once on the far left (before x₁) and once on the far right (after x₃). Therefore, two real roots.

So summarizing:

- k &gt; M: two real roots.

- k = M: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots.

- k = m₃: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: three real roots.

- k = m₁: three real roots (one double, two simple? Wait, earlier analysis said two roots, but maybe I messed up).

Wait, let me re-examine k = m₁. If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root) and since between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, total of two distinct real roots: x₁ (double) and one between x₂ and x₃. So, in terms of distinct roots, two; in terms of total roots counting multiplicity, three. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for (a). If &quot;exactly one&quot; means one distinct root, then even if it&#x27;s a double root, that would still be considered one real root. But in standard terminology, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, they usually mean one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. However, in the case of k = M, we have three real roots but one is a double root. The problem&#x27;s option (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, so distinctness is important there. So, for (a), if there exists a k where f(x) = k has exactly one real root (distinct or not?), the answer depends on that.

But in the case where k is less than m₁, we have two distinct real roots. If k is equal to m₁, we have two real roots (x₁ is a double root, and another one). If k is between m₁ and m₃, three real roots. If k is equal to m₃ or M, three real roots (with a double root). If k is between m₃ and M, four real roots. If k is greater than M, two real roots.

Wait, but in none of these cases do we have exactly one real root. Even when k is less than m₁, we have two real roots. When k equals m₁ or m₃ or M, we have two or three real roots but with multiplicities. So, there is no k for which f(x) = k has exactly one real root, right? Unless when the polynomial is tangent to the line y = k at one point and doesn&#x27;t cross it elsewhere, but given the shape of the quartic, which tends to +infty on both sides, if the horizontal line is tangent at the local maximum or one of the minima, it will still cross the graph on one side or the other. Wait, for example, if k is equal to the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = M has a double root at x₂ and two other roots on the left and right. Wait, no. Wait, at k = M, the horizontal line touches the local maximum at x₂. To the left of x₂, the function is increasing from m₁ to M, so it only reaches M at x₂. To the right of x₂, the function decreases from M to m₃ and then increases again. Therefore, the line y = M would intersect the graph only at x₂ (a double root) and on the right side as the function increases past M again? Wait, no. Wait, after x₃, the function increases from m₃ to +infty. If M is the local maximum, then m₃ is less than M. So, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is less than M) up to +infty, so it must cross y = M once after x₃. Similarly, to the left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁ (which is less than M), so it must cross y = M once before x₁. Therefore, when k = M, the equation f(x) = M has three real roots: one at x₂ (double root) and one on each side. Therefore, three distinct real roots? Wait, but x₂ is a double root, so in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s three: x₂, and one on each side. So multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect distinctness. Therefore, even though x₂ is a double root, it&#x27;s still one distinct root. So in that case, k = M gives three distinct real roots, with one of them being a double root. Wait, no. If a root is a double root, it&#x27;s still a single distinct root; the distinctness refers to the x-values. So x₂ is one distinct root, and the other two are also distinct. So in total, three distinct real roots, one with multiplicity two. Therefore, for the problem&#x27;s option (b): &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Well, when k = M or k = m₁ or k = m₃, you have three real roots, but with one double root. But the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would require all three roots to be distinct, i.e., no multiple roots. So in that case, even though at k = M you have three real roots, one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. Therefore, the answer would be that statement (b) is false. Wait, but when k is between m₃ and M, we have four distinct real roots. When k is between m₁ and m₃, three distinct real roots. When k is less than m₁ or greater than M, two distinct real roots. When k equals M, m₁, or m₃, three real roots with one double root.

Therefore, the statement (b) says: &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Given that when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three distinct real roots (as per the earlier analysis). Wait, earlier I thought when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three real roots. Wait, let&#x27;s recheck.

Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two local minima, then depending on the graph, how does the horizontal line intersect? Suppose m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum, with m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, k between m₁ and m₃ would be above m₁ and below m₃. Then, on the left side (x &lt; x₁), the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is below k, so it crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is above k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross. Therefore, three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots because they are in different intervals. Therefore, statement (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima, we get three distinct real roots. Additionally, if m₁ &gt; m₃, then similar logic applies, just switch left and right.

Therefore, regardless of the relative positions of the minima, there exists a k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Therefore, option (b) is true.

But wait, the answer options are (a), (b), (c), (d). Let&#x27;s check the options again:

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

From the analysis above:

- (a) is false because for any real k, f(x) = k has either two, three, or four real roots. There is no k where it has exactly one real root.

- (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima (or between the higher local minimum and the local maximum, but actually in our case, between m₁ and m₃, assuming m₁ &lt; m₃), the equation f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

Wait, earlier, when k is between m₁ and m₃, which are both minima, the horizontal line y = k intersects the graph three times: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots.

- (c) is false because when k is greater than M or less than m₁ (the lower of the two minima), f(x) = k has only two real roots.

- (d) is false because when k is between the two local minima or between a local minimum and the local maximum, f(x) = k has four or three real roots, respectively, so not always two real and two complex roots.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

But wait, the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, and the options are (a)-(d). The analysis above suggests that (b) is true. However, in the initial problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots. Wait, but in our analysis, we concluded that between the two local minima, we can get three real roots. But the key is that the quartic has three critical points: two minima and one maximum or two maxima and one minima, but in this case, with leading coefficient positive, it&#x27;s two minima and one maximum.

But let me verify with an example. Take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x + 1. Wait, maybe a simpler example. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 2x³ - 3x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 6x² - 6x. Let&#x27;s find the critical points.

Wait, maybe a better example is f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has three real roots: x = 0, x = sqrt(2), x = -sqrt(2). So the critical points are at x = -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). Then f(x) at these points: f(-sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(2))⁴ - 4*(sqrt(2))² = 4 - 8 = -4. f(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. f(sqrt(2)) = same as f(-sqrt(2)) = -4. So the local minima are at x = ±sqrt(2) with f(x) = -4, and the local maximum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0. So this is a symmetric quartic. Then, for k between -4 and 0, f(x) = k has four real roots. For k = 0, it has three real roots (double root at x = 0 and two at ±sqrt(something)). For k &lt; -4, two real roots. For k &gt; 0, two real roots. For k between the minima and the maximum (i.e., between -4 and 0), four real roots. For k exactly at -4, three real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). Wait, but in this case, the two minima are equal. So here, m₁ = m₃ = -4. Therefore, there is no interval between m₁ and m₃; they are the same. Therefore, in this symmetric case, when k is between -4 and 0, you get four real roots, but when k is exactly -4, you get two real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). However, the original problem states that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does: -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). So in this case, the two minima are equal. Therefore, if the two local minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are equal), so the three real roots case doesn&#x27;t occur. Wait, but the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; for f’(x). In this example, f’(x) has three distinct real roots. But in this case, the minima are equal, so between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, you get four real roots. But if the minima are not equal, then between them, you would have three real roots.

Therefore, the key is whether the two local minima can be at different heights. If f’(x) has three distinct real roots, but the function f(x) could still have two equal minima. Wait, but in the example above, even with symmetric critical points, the minima are equal. So perhaps, depending on the coefficients, the minima can be equal or not. Therefore, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether the minima are equal or not, only that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Therefore, in some cases, you might have equal minima, in others not. Therefore, the answer would depend on whether, regardless of the specific f(x) meeting the condition, statement (b) is always true.

But wait, in the example where minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are the same), so the three real roots case would not exist. However, in that case, when k is between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, which is the same as saying between m and M, you get four real roots. When k is less than m or greater than M, you get two real roots. When k equals m, you get two double roots. When k equals M, you get three real roots (a double root and two simple roots). Therefore, in the symmetric case, statement (b) is false because there is no k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. When k = M, you have three real roots but one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. When k is between m and M, you have four distinct real roots. When k is less than m, two distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric case, statement (b) is false. But the problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does, but the minima are equal. Therefore, the correct answer would not always be (b). Therefore, my previous analysis was incorrect.

Therefore, there&#x27;s a problem: if the quartic is symmetric, with two equal minima, then there is no k for which f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) would not hold in such cases. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot; given that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Since there exist such polynomials where statement (b) is false, but there also exist polynomials where statement (b) is true. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the statement must hold for all such polynomials or if there exists at least one. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, implying that the statement must be always true given the conditions.

Therefore, since there exists a polynomial where f’(x) has three distinct real roots but there&#x27;s no k with three distinct real roots (like the symmetric quartic example), statement (b) is not always true. Therefore, my previous conclusion was wrong.

Then, what is the correct answer? Let&#x27;s re-examine the options.

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

In the symmetric example, the only possible numbers of real roots are two (k &lt; m), four (m &lt; k &lt; M), three (k = m or k = M), or two (k &gt; M). So in this case, there is no k with exactly one real root. Therefore, statement (a) is false.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric example, when k = m or k = M, we have three real roots but with a double root, so they are not distinct. Therefore, in this case, there is no k with three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) is false.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

False, since for k &gt; M or k &lt; m, there are only two real roots.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

False, since for some k, there are four real roots.

Therefore, in this case, none of the options are true? But that can&#x27;t be, because the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the symmetric example. Let&#x27;s take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has roots at x = 0, sqrt(2), -sqrt(2). So three distinct real roots. The function f(x) = x⁴ - 4x² has local maxima at x = 0 (f(0) = 0) and local minima at x = ±sqrt(2) (f(±sqrt(2)) = -4). Then, for k = -4, the equation f(x) = -4 has double roots at x = ±sqrt(2). For k = 0, it has a double root at x = 0 and simple roots at x = ±2. So, in this case, when k = 0, the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. Therefore, three real roots, but only two distinct ones (x = 0 and x = ±2). Wait, no. If x = ±2 are roots, then total roots are x = 0 (double), x = 2, and x = -2. So four roots total, but with x = 0 counted twice. However, the equation x⁴ - 4x² = 0 factors as x²(x² - 4) = 0, so roots at x = 0 (multiplicity 2), x = 2, x = -2. So in this case, for k = 0, there are three distinct real roots (0, 2, -2), with one of them being a double root. Therefore, in terms of distinct real roots, it&#x27;s three. So, statement (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would be true here because even though 0 is a double root, the roots are still distinct: -2, 0, 2. So in this case, k = 0 gives three distinct real roots, even with a double root at 0. Therefore, perhaps in this example, statement (b) is true.

Wait, but if we take k = -4, then f(x) = -4 has roots at x = ±sqrt(2), each with multiplicity two. So, two distinct real roots, each a double root. Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is not satisfied for k = -4, but for k = 0, we have three distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric example, there does exist a k (specifically k = 0) such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) is true.

But earlier, I thought that when the minima are equal, there&#x27;s no k between them, but in reality, even in the symmetric case, there is a k (the local maximum) where you have three distinct real roots. So regardless of whether the minima are equal or not, the local maximum will always provide a k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Let me check.

In the symmetric example, at k = 0 (the local maximum), the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double root) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) holds.

If we take another example where the minima are not equal. Let’s construct a quartic with two unequal minima. For example, f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x. Compute its derivative: f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x² + 4x + 4. I need to check if this derivative has three distinct real roots. Instead of computing, maybe take a known quartic. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 6x² + 4x. Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x + 4. Let&#x27;s check the roots of f’(x). Maybe this cubic has three real roots. Alternatively, use f(x) = x⁴ - 3x³ - 3x² + 4x + 1. Not sure. Alternatively, take f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4), but that would have four real roots, but its derivative would have three critical points. However, expanding this would be time-consuming.

Alternatively, take a quartic with two minima at different heights. Suppose f(x) has a local minimum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0, a local maximum at x = 1 with f(1) = 2, and another local minimum at x = 2 with f(2) = 1. Then, the function would go from +infty down to 0 at x = 0, up to 2 at x = 1, down to 1 at x = 2, and back up to +infty. In this case, m₁ = 0, M = 2, m₃ = 1. Then, for k between m₁ = 0 and m₃ = 1, the equation f(x) = k would have three distinct real roots: one left of 0, one between 0 and 1, and one between 1 and 2. For k between m₃ = 1 and M = 2, four distinct real roots. For k = 1, three real roots (double root at x = 2 and two others). For k = 0, three real roots (double root at x = 0 and one other). For k = 2, three real roots (double root at x = 1 and two others). For k &lt; 0, two real roots; for k &gt; 2, two real roots.

Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k between 0 and 1 (the two minima) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric case, even though the minima are equal, there&#x27;s still a k = M where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots (with a double root at the local maximum). Wait, no. In the symmetric case, k = M is the local maximum. For example, in f(x) = x⁴ - 4x², the local maximum is at x = 0 with k = 0. The equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, even in the symmetric case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k (specifically k = M) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Even though one of them is a double root, but the roots are still distinct in terms of their x-values. Wait, no. A double root at x = 0 means that x = 0 is a repeated root, but the distinct roots are x = -2, x = 0, x = 2. Therefore, three distinct real roots. The multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect the distinctness. Therefore, even if there is a multiple root, as long as there are three separate x-values, it&#x27;s three distinct real roots. Therefore, in both symmetric and asymmetric cases, statement (b) holds.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) with real coefficients, we know that its derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) has three distinct real roots. This implies that \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum (since the leading coefficient is positive, the polynomial tends to \( +\infty \) as \( x \to \pm\infty \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Critical Points and Graph Shape**:
   - The polynomial \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum.
   - The graph of \( f(x) \) will have a &quot;W&quot; shape with two local minima and one local maximum.

2. **Behavior of \( f(x) = k \)**:
   - For \( k \) values greater than the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local maximum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the local maximum and the higher local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has four real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to either local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local minimum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the two local minima, \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - For \( k \) values less than the lower local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.

3. **Evaluation of Statements**:
   - **(a)** False: There is no \( k \) such that \( f(x) = k \) has exactly one real root.
   - **(b)** True: There exists a \( k \) (between the two local minima) where \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - **(c)** False: \( f(x) = k \) does not always have four distinct real roots (e.g., for \( k \) outside the range between the local minima and maximum).
   - **(d)** False: \( f(x) = k \) can have four real roots for some \( k \), so it does not always have two real and two complex roots.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out which of the statements (a), (b), (c), or (d) is true given that the polynomial f(x) = x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d has a derivative f’(x) with three distinct real roots. Let me start by recalling some calculus and polynomial theory.

First, since f(x) is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, its derivative f’(x) is a cubic (degree 3) polynomial. The problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. That means the derivative has three distinct critical points where the slope of f(x) is zero. For a cubic polynomial to have three distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive, but I might not need to compute that here. The key takeaway is that the original function f(x) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum, or two local maxima and one local minimum. Since the derivative is a cubic with three real roots, it must alternate between increasing and decreasing appropriately.

Now, the graph of a quartic polynomial typically has a &quot;W&quot; shape or an &quot;M&quot; shape depending on the leading coefficient. Since the leading term here is x⁴, which has a positive coefficient, as x approaches positive or negative infinity, f(x) tends to positive infinity. Therefore, the graph will eventually rise on both ends. Given that the derivative has three real roots, there are three critical points. For a quartic with positive leading coefficient, the typical shape with three critical points would be two local minima and one local maximum in between. So, the graph would go up, then down, then up, then down, then up again? Wait, no. Wait, the derivative is cubic, so it can have three critical points. So the original function f(x) will have three turning points. Since it&#x27;s a quartic, it can have up to three turning points (since the derivative is cubic, which can have up to three roots). So with three critical points, the graph of f(x) will have two local minima and one local maximum, or two maxima and one minima. But given that the leading coefficient is positive, as x approaches ±∞, f(x) goes to +∞. Therefore, the rightmost and leftmost critical points must be minima. So the structure would be: starting from the left, the function decreases to a local maximum, then increases to a local minimum, then decreases again to a local maximum, and then increases to infinity? Wait, that doesn&#x27;t make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if the derivative has three real roots, then the original function f(x) has three critical points. Let me label them as x₁ &lt; x₂ &lt; x₃. Since the leading term is positive, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, and the same as x approaches -infty. So, the rightmost critical point x₃ must be a local minimum (since after that, the function increases to infinity), and the leftmost critical point x₁ must be a local maximum (since coming from -infty, the function is decreasing until x₁, then starts increasing). Wait, no, that seems contradictory. Let me check:

If x approaches -infty, f(x) tends to +infty, so as we move from left to right (from -infty to +infty), the function starts at +infty, then at some point x₁ (the leftmost critical point) it might turn. If x₁ is a local maximum, then after x₁, the function decreases. Then, at x₂, another critical point, which would have to be a local minimum, so after x₂, the function increases again. Then at x₃, another critical point, which would be a local maximum, and then after x₃, the function decreases. But wait, but after x₃, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, which is a contradiction because if x₃ is a local maximum, then after x₃, the function should decrease, but it actually needs to increase to +infty. Therefore, that can&#x27;t be. Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the leftmost critical point x₁ is a local minimum. Let&#x27;s see: starting from -infty, f(x) is going to +infty. Then at x₁, which is a local minimum, the function starts increasing. Then at x₂, a local maximum, so after x₂, the function decreases. Then at x₃, another local minimum, so after x₃, the function increases again towards +infty. That makes sense. So the critical points are arranged as local minimum at x₁, local maximum at x₂, local minimum at x₃. Therefore, the graph has two local minima and one local maximum.

So the function f(x) would start at +infty, decrease to a local minimum at x₁, then increase to a local maximum at x₂, then decrease to a local minimum at x₃, and then increase again to +infty. So, the graph would look like a &quot;W&quot; but with the middle peak being a local maximum and the two valleys being local minima. So, the function has two local minima and one local maximum.

Given that structure, let&#x27;s consider the possible number of real roots for f(x) = k. Depending on the value of k, the horizontal line y = k can intersect the graph of f(x) in different ways.

If k is greater than the value of the local maximum at x₂, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃, because the function only exceeds k on the far left and far right.

If k is exactly equal to the value of the local maximum at x₂, then f(x) = k would have three real roots: one at x₂ (with multiplicity two, since it&#x27;s a local maximum) and one on each side (left of x₁ and right of x₃). But wait, if the local maximum is exactly at k, then the graph touches the line y = k at x₂, so that&#x27;s a double root, and crosses the line on either side. So three real roots, but one of them is a double root.

If k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two local minima, then suppose the local minima at x₁ and x₃ have values m₁ and m₃. Let&#x27;s assume that one of the minima is lower than the other. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, both minima must be below the local maximum. However, depending on the specific coefficients, one minimum could be lower than the other. Let&#x27;s say, without loss of generality, that m₁ &lt; m₃ (the left local minimum is lower than the right local minimum). Then, if k is between m₃ and the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots: two on the left side (between -infty and x₁, and between x₁ and x₂), and two on the right side (between x₂ and x₃, and between x₃ and +infty). Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two minima, say between M and m₃ (assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), then when k is in (m₃, M), the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. But actually, when you have two minima and one maximum, the graph goes from +infty to m₁ (local min), rises to M (local max), then falls to m₃ (local min), then rises again to +infty. So if k is between m₁ and M, then depending on where k is relative to m₃, the number of roots changes.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch a rough graph mentally. Starting from the left (x approaching -infty), f(x) is at +infty, decreases to m₁ at x₁ (local min), then increases to M at x₂ (local max), then decreases to m₃ at x₃ (local min), then increases back to +infty.

So, if k is greater than M, then the equation f(x) = k has two real roots: one on the far left and one on the far right.

If k is equal to M, then it has three real roots: one at x₂ (a double root) and one on each side.

If k is between m₃ and M, then it has four real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, one between x₂ and x₃, and one right of x₃.

If k is equal to m₃, then it has three real roots: one at x₃ (double root) and one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂.

If k is between m₁ and m₃, then it has two real roots: one left of x₁ and one right of x₃, because the horizontal line y = k only intersects the graph on the leftmost and rightmost ascending parts. Wait, but between x₁ and x₃, the function reaches a maximum at x₂, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, then the line y = k would cross the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. Wait, but if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the minima, but since m₁ is lower than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ to M, so it must cross y = k once there. Similarly, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then since m₃ is higher than m₁, and k is between m₁ and m₃, then on the interval x₂ to x₃, the function decreases from M to m₃, crossing y = k once. Similarly, on the interval x₃ to +infty, the function increases from m₃ to +infty, so y = k would cross once there. Similarly, on the interval -infty to x₁, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, crossing y = k once. Therefore, actually, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots. If k is equal to m₁, then it&#x27;s a double root at x₁ and another root on the right. Similarly, if k is equal to m₃, it&#x27;s a double root at x₃ and another root on the left. If k is less than m₁, since m₁ is the lower of the two minima, then the line y = k would intersect the graph only twice: once left of x₁ and once right of x₃. Wait, no. If k is less than m₁, which is the minimum, then the graph only reaches down to m₁, so y = k would not intersect the graph at all? Wait, no. Wait, as x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches +infty, and at x₁, it&#x27;s a local minimum m₁. So if k &lt; m₁, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃? Wait, but if k is less than m₁, which is the minimum value on the left side, then on the left side, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, so it must cross y = k once. On the right side, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is higher than m₁) up to +infty, so if k is less than m₁, then since m₃ is greater than m₁, and k is less than m₁, then on the right side, the function starts at m₃ (which is greater than k) and increases to infinity, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, if k &lt; m₁, there is only one real root on the left side. Similarly, if k &gt; M, there are two real roots on the extremes. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to tabulate the different cases.

Let me denote:

- The leftmost local minimum at x = x₁ with f(x₁) = m₁.

- The local maximum at x = x₂ with f(x₂) = M.

- The rightmost local minimum at x = x₃ with f(x₃) = m₃.

Assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ (since x₁ &lt; x₃ and the function might have asymmetrical minima), though it could also be m₃ &lt; m₁. Wait, but since the function is going from m₁ up to M, then down to m₃, and then up again. The relative positions of m₁ and m₃ depend on the specific coefficients. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify, so I can&#x27;t assume which is lower. Therefore, perhaps I need to consider both possibilities. But maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter. Let&#x27;s suppose m₁ ≤ m₃ for definiteness. Then:

- If k &gt; M: two real roots (left and right).

- If k = M: three real roots (one double root at x₂ and two simple roots on the sides).

- If m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots (left, between x₁ and x₂, between x₂ and x₃, right).

- If k = m₃: three real roots (double root at x₃ and two others).

- If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: four real roots (similar to above? Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, but the function between x₁ and x₂ goes up to M, which is higher than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function crosses y = k once (since it goes from m₁ to M), between x₂ and x₃, it crosses once (since it goes from M to m₃), and on both ends, left of x₁ and right of x₃, the function is above k? Wait, no. Wait, the left end (x approaching -infty) is +infty, so coming from the left, the function starts at +infty, decreases to m₁ (which is less than k, since k &gt; m₁), so it must cross y = k once on the left side (before x₁). Then, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross there. Wait, but m₃ is greater than k, so after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so if m₃ &gt; k, then it never crosses y = k again. Therefore, in this case, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k has three real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, and one between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought.

Wait, perhaps I need to more carefully analyze:

Case 1: k &gt; M. Then, the horizontal line y = k cuts the graph at two points: one far left (before x₁) and one far right (after x₃).

Case 2: k = M. The line touches the local maximum at x₂ and cuts the graph on the left and right sides, resulting in three real roots (one double root at x₂).

Case 3: m₃ &lt; k &lt; M. The line y = k intersects the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃.

Wait, but if m₃ is the right local minimum, and k is greater than m₃ but less than M, then after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so since k &gt; m₃, there will be a crossing right of x₃. Similarly, left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is less than k (since k &gt; m₃ and m₃ &gt; m₁, so k &gt; m₁). Therefore, left of x₁, the function crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ (which is less than k) up to M (which is greater than k), so crosses once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is less than k), so crosses once. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to infinity, crossing once. Therefore, four crossings. So that&#x27;s four real roots.

Case 4: k = m₃. The line touches the local minimum at x₃, so it&#x27;s a double root there, and crosses the graph left of x₁ and between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so at k = m₃, it only touches at x₃. Therefore, the roots would be left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂ (since the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing k = m₃ if m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), but wait, m₃ is the value at x₃, which is a local minimum. If k = m₃, then between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so it reaches m₃ at x₃. Therefore, if k = m₃, then there&#x27;s a root at x₃ (double root) and another root left of x₁ (since the function decreases from +infty to m₁, which is less than m₃, so crosses y = m₃ once left of x₁) and another root between x₁ and x₂ (as the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing y = m₃ once). So total of three roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and a double root at x₃.

Case 5: m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃. Here, k is between the two local minima. Since m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum. Let&#x27;s assume m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph as follows:

- Left of x₁: the function comes down from +infty to m₁, which is less than k, so it crosses y = k once.

- Between x₁ and x₂: the function goes from m₁ (less than k) up to M (greater than k), so crosses once.

- Between x₂ and x₃: the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so crosses once.

- Right of x₃: the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = k there.

Therefore, total of three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃.

Wait, but hold on. If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃, then m₃ is greater than k, so right of x₃, the function starts at m₃ and goes up, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, only three real roots? But earlier, when k is between m₃ and M, we had four roots. Hmm.

Case 6: k = m₁. The line touches the left local minimum at x₁, resulting in a double root there. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than m₁), so if k = m₁, which is less than m₃, the function crosses y = k once between x₂ and x₃. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ to +infty, which is above k, so no crossing. Also, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M, so crosses y = k once. Wait, but if k = m₁, then between x₁ and x₂, the function starts at m₁ (k) and goes up, so the crossing is exactly at x₁, which is a double root. Then, another crossing between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, three real roots: double root at x₁ and single roots between x₂ and x₃ and right of x₃? Wait, no. Wait, if k = m₁, then at x₁, the function has a local minimum. So the graph touches y = k at x₁, and then goes up. On the left side, as x approaches -infty, the function approaches +infty, so it comes down from +infty to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, left of x₁, there&#x27;s no crossing since it&#x27;s decreasing to m₁. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root because it&#x27;s a local minimum). Then, moving from x₁ to x₂, the function increases to M, which is greater than m₁, so there&#x27;s no crossing there. Then, from x₂ to x₃, the function decreases to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Then, from x₃ to +infty, the function increases to +infty, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = m₁ again. Therefore, total of two real roots: a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but the original function at x approaching -infty is +infty, so when approaching from the left, the function decreases to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, for k = m₁, the leftmost intersection is exactly at x₁ (a double root), and then another intersection between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, two real roots (one double, one single). But in the context of the problem, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot; or &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, do they count multiplicity? The problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for option (a). If they count multiplicity, then at k = m₁, f(x) = k has two real roots (one double, one single). If they don&#x27;t count multiplicity, then maybe it&#x27;s considered as two real roots (but one is a double root). Wait, the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;. So if multiplicity is considered, then a double root would count as one root, but actually, in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s still one. Wait, no. Wait, multiplicity is about the number of roots counting multiplicity. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, which might mean exactly one distinct real root, or exactly one real root counting multiplicity. The question is ambiguous, but in standard terminology, &quot;exactly one real root&quot; usually refers to exactly one distinct real root, but in some contexts, it might count multiplicity. However, in options (b) and (c), they mention &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; and &quot;four distinct real roots&quot;, so it seems like they are distinguishing between distinct roots and multiple roots. Therefore, for (a), &quot;exactly one real root&quot; probably means exactly one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. Similarly, for (b), &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;. So in the case where k = m₁, we have a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃, so that&#x27;s two distinct real roots (x₁ with multiplicity two and another root). Therefore, (a) is not satisfied here.

Case 7: k &lt; m₁. Then, the horizontal line y = k is below both local minima. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, the line y = k would intersect the graph twice: once on the far left (before x₁) and once on the far right (after x₃). Therefore, two real roots.

So summarizing:

- k &gt; M: two real roots.

- k = M: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots.

- k = m₃: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: three real roots.

- k = m₁: three real roots (one double, two simple? Wait, earlier analysis said two roots, but maybe I messed up).

Wait, let me re-examine k = m₁. If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root) and since between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, total of two distinct real roots: x₁ (double) and one between x₂ and x₃. So, in terms of distinct roots, two; in terms of total roots counting multiplicity, three. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for (a). If &quot;exactly one&quot; means one distinct root, then even if it&#x27;s a double root, that would still be considered one real root. But in standard terminology, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, they usually mean one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. However, in the case of k = M, we have three real roots but one is a double root. The problem&#x27;s option (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, so distinctness is important there. So, for (a), if there exists a k where f(x) = k has exactly one real root (distinct or not?), the answer depends on that.

But in the case where k is less than m₁, we have two distinct real roots. If k is equal to m₁, we have two real roots (x₁ is a double root, and another one). If k is between m₁ and m₃, three real roots. If k is equal to m₃ or M, three real roots (with a double root). If k is between m₃ and M, four real roots. If k is greater than M, two real roots.

Wait, but in none of these cases do we have exactly one real root. Even when k is less than m₁, we have two real roots. When k equals m₁ or m₃ or M, we have two or three real roots but with multiplicities. So, there is no k for which f(x) = k has exactly one real root, right? Unless when the polynomial is tangent to the line y = k at one point and doesn&#x27;t cross it elsewhere, but given the shape of the quartic, which tends to +infty on both sides, if the horizontal line is tangent at the local maximum or one of the minima, it will still cross the graph on one side or the other. Wait, for example, if k is equal to the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = M has a double root at x₂ and two other roots on the left and right. Wait, no. Wait, at k = M, the horizontal line touches the local maximum at x₂. To the left of x₂, the function is increasing from m₁ to M, so it only reaches M at x₂. To the right of x₂, the function decreases from M to m₃ and then increases again. Therefore, the line y = M would intersect the graph only at x₂ (a double root) and on the right side as the function increases past M again? Wait, no. Wait, after x₃, the function increases from m₃ to +infty. If M is the local maximum, then m₃ is less than M. So, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is less than M) up to +infty, so it must cross y = M once after x₃. Similarly, to the left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁ (which is less than M), so it must cross y = M once before x₁. Therefore, when k = M, the equation f(x) = M has three real roots: one at x₂ (double root) and one on each side. Therefore, three distinct real roots? Wait, but x₂ is a double root, so in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s three: x₂, and one on each side. So multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect distinctness. Therefore, even though x₂ is a double root, it&#x27;s still one distinct root. So in that case, k = M gives three distinct real roots, with one of them being a double root. Wait, no. If a root is a double root, it&#x27;s still a single distinct root; the distinctness refers to the x-values. So x₂ is one distinct root, and the other two are also distinct. So in total, three distinct real roots, one with multiplicity two. Therefore, for the problem&#x27;s option (b): &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Well, when k = M or k = m₁ or k = m₃, you have three real roots, but with one double root. But the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would require all three roots to be distinct, i.e., no multiple roots. So in that case, even though at k = M you have three real roots, one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. Therefore, the answer would be that statement (b) is false. Wait, but when k is between m₃ and M, we have four distinct real roots. When k is between m₁ and m₃, three distinct real roots. When k is less than m₁ or greater than M, two distinct real roots. When k equals M, m₁, or m₃, three real roots with one double root.

Therefore, the statement (b) says: &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Given that when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three distinct real roots (as per the earlier analysis). Wait, earlier I thought when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three real roots. Wait, let&#x27;s recheck.

Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two local minima, then depending on the graph, how does the horizontal line intersect? Suppose m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum, with m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, k between m₁ and m₃ would be above m₁ and below m₃. Then, on the left side (x &lt; x₁), the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is below k, so it crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is above k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross. Therefore, three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots because they are in different intervals. Therefore, statement (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima, we get three distinct real roots. Additionally, if m₁ &gt; m₃, then similar logic applies, just switch left and right.

Therefore, regardless of the relative positions of the minima, there exists a k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Therefore, option (b) is true.

But wait, the answer options are (a), (b), (c), (d). Let&#x27;s check the options again:

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

From the analysis above:

- (a) is false because for any real k, f(x) = k has either two, three, or four real roots. There is no k where it has exactly one real root.

- (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima (or between the higher local minimum and the local maximum, but actually in our case, between m₁ and m₃, assuming m₁ &lt; m₃), the equation f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

Wait, earlier, when k is between m₁ and m₃, which are both minima, the horizontal line y = k intersects the graph three times: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots.

- (c) is false because when k is greater than M or less than m₁ (the lower of the two minima), f(x) = k has only two real roots.

- (d) is false because when k is between the two local minima or between a local minimum and the local maximum, f(x) = k has four or three real roots, respectively, so not always two real and two complex roots.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

But wait, the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, and the options are (a)-(d). The analysis above suggests that (b) is true. However, in the initial problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots. Wait, but in our analysis, we concluded that between the two local minima, we can get three real roots. But the key is that the quartic has three critical points: two minima and one maximum or two maxima and one minima, but in this case, with leading coefficient positive, it&#x27;s two minima and one maximum.

But let me verify with an example. Take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x + 1. Wait, maybe a simpler example. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 2x³ - 3x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 6x² - 6x. Let&#x27;s find the critical points.

Wait, maybe a better example is f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has three real roots: x = 0, x = sqrt(2), x = -sqrt(2). So the critical points are at x = -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). Then f(x) at these points: f(-sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(2))⁴ - 4*(sqrt(2))² = 4 - 8 = -4. f(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. f(sqrt(2)) = same as f(-sqrt(2)) = -4. So the local minima are at x = ±sqrt(2) with f(x) = -4, and the local maximum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0. So this is a symmetric quartic. Then, for k between -4 and 0, f(x) = k has four real roots. For k = 0, it has three real roots (double root at x = 0 and two at ±sqrt(something)). For k &lt; -4, two real roots. For k &gt; 0, two real roots. For k between the minima and the maximum (i.e., between -4 and 0), four real roots. For k exactly at -4, three real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). Wait, but in this case, the two minima are equal. So here, m₁ = m₃ = -4. Therefore, there is no interval between m₁ and m₃; they are the same. Therefore, in this symmetric case, when k is between -4 and 0, you get four real roots, but when k is exactly -4, you get two real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). However, the original problem states that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does: -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). So in this case, the two minima are equal. Therefore, if the two local minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are equal), so the three real roots case doesn&#x27;t occur. Wait, but the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; for f’(x). In this example, f’(x) has three distinct real roots. But in this case, the minima are equal, so between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, you get four real roots. But if the minima are not equal, then between them, you would have three real roots.

Therefore, the key is whether the two local minima can be at different heights. If f’(x) has three distinct real roots, but the function f(x) could still have two equal minima. Wait, but in the example above, even with symmetric critical points, the minima are equal. So perhaps, depending on the coefficients, the minima can be equal or not. Therefore, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether the minima are equal or not, only that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Therefore, in some cases, you might have equal minima, in others not. Therefore, the answer would depend on whether, regardless of the specific f(x) meeting the condition, statement (b) is always true.

But wait, in the example where minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are the same), so the three real roots case would not exist. However, in that case, when k is between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, which is the same as saying between m and M, you get four real roots. When k is less than m or greater than M, you get two real roots. When k equals m, you get two double roots. When k equals M, you get three real roots (a double root and two simple roots). Therefore, in the symmetric case, statement (b) is false because there is no k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. When k = M, you have three real roots but one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. When k is between m and M, you have four distinct real roots. When k is less than m, two distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric case, statement (b) is false. But the problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does, but the minima are equal. Therefore, the correct answer would not always be (b). Therefore, my previous analysis was incorrect.

Therefore, there&#x27;s a problem: if the quartic is symmetric, with two equal minima, then there is no k for which f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) would not hold in such cases. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot; given that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Since there exist such polynomials where statement (b) is false, but there also exist polynomials where statement (b) is true. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the statement must hold for all such polynomials or if there exists at least one. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, implying that the statement must be always true given the conditions.

Therefore, since there exists a polynomial where f’(x) has three distinct real roots but there&#x27;s no k with three distinct real roots (like the symmetric quartic example), statement (b) is not always true. Therefore, my previous conclusion was wrong.

Then, what is the correct answer? Let&#x27;s re-examine the options.

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

In the symmetric example, the only possible numbers of real roots are two (k &lt; m), four (m &lt; k &lt; M), three (k = m or k = M), or two (k &gt; M). So in this case, there is no k with exactly one real root. Therefore, statement (a) is false.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric example, when k = m or k = M, we have three real roots but with a double root, so they are not distinct. Therefore, in this case, there is no k with three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) is false.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

False, since for k &gt; M or k &lt; m, there are only two real roots.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

False, since for some k, there are four real roots.

Therefore, in this case, none of the options are true? But that can&#x27;t be, because the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the symmetric example. Let&#x27;s take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has roots at x = 0, sqrt(2), -sqrt(2). So three distinct real roots. The function f(x) = x⁴ - 4x² has local maxima at x = 0 (f(0) = 0) and local minima at x = ±sqrt(2) (f(±sqrt(2)) = -4). Then, for k = -4, the equation f(x) = -4 has double roots at x = ±sqrt(2). For k = 0, it has a double root at x = 0 and simple roots at x = ±2. So, in this case, when k = 0, the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. Therefore, three real roots, but only two distinct ones (x = 0 and x = ±2). Wait, no. If x = ±2 are roots, then total roots are x = 0 (double), x = 2, and x = -2. So four roots total, but with x = 0 counted twice. However, the equation x⁴ - 4x² = 0 factors as x²(x² - 4) = 0, so roots at x = 0 (multiplicity 2), x = 2, x = -2. So in this case, for k = 0, there are three distinct real roots (0, 2, -2), with one of them being a double root. Therefore, in terms of distinct real roots, it&#x27;s three. So, statement (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would be true here because even though 0 is a double root, the roots are still distinct: -2, 0, 2. So in this case, k = 0 gives three distinct real roots, even with a double root at 0. Therefore, perhaps in this example, statement (b) is true.

Wait, but if we take k = -4, then f(x) = -4 has roots at x = ±sqrt(2), each with multiplicity two. So, two distinct real roots, each a double root. Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is not satisfied for k = -4, but for k = 0, we have three distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric example, there does exist a k (specifically k = 0) such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) is true.

But earlier, I thought that when the minima are equal, there&#x27;s no k between them, but in reality, even in the symmetric case, there is a k (the local maximum) where you have three distinct real roots. So regardless of whether the minima are equal or not, the local maximum will always provide a k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Let me check.

In the symmetric example, at k = 0 (the local maximum), the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double root) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) holds.

If we take another example where the minima are not equal. Let’s construct a quartic with two unequal minima. For example, f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x. Compute its derivative: f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x² + 4x + 4. I need to check if this derivative has three distinct real roots. Instead of computing, maybe take a known quartic. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 6x² + 4x. Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x + 4. Let&#x27;s check the roots of f’(x). Maybe this cubic has three real roots. Alternatively, use f(x) = x⁴ - 3x³ - 3x² + 4x + 1. Not sure. Alternatively, take f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4), but that would have four real roots, but its derivative would have three critical points. However, expanding this would be time-consuming.

Alternatively, take a quartic with two minima at different heights. Suppose f(x) has a local minimum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0, a local maximum at x = 1 with f(1) = 2, and another local minimum at x = 2 with f(2) = 1. Then, the function would go from +infty down to 0 at x = 0, up to 2 at x = 1, down to 1 at x = 2, and back up to +infty. In this case, m₁ = 0, M = 2, m₃ = 1. Then, for k between m₁ = 0 and m₃ = 1, the equation f(x) = k would have three distinct real roots: one left of 0, one between 0 and 1, and one between 1 and 2. For k between m₃ = 1 and M = 2, four distinct real roots. For k = 1, three real roots (double root at x = 2 and two others). For k = 0, three real roots (double root at x = 0 and one other). For k = 2, three real roots (double root at x = 1 and two others). For k &lt; 0, two real roots; for k &gt; 2, two real roots.

Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k between 0 and 1 (the two minima) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric case, even though the minima are equal, there&#x27;s still a k = M where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots (with a double root at the local maximum). Wait, no. In the symmetric case, k = M is the local maximum. For example, in f(x) = x⁴ - 4x², the local maximum is at x = 0 with k = 0. The equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, even in the symmetric case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k (specifically k = M) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Even though one of them is a double root, but the roots are still distinct in terms of their x-values. Wait, no. A double root at x = 0 means that x = 0 is a repeated root, but the distinct roots are x = -2, x = 0, x = 2. Therefore, three distinct real roots. The multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect the distinctness. Therefore, even if there is a multiple root, as long as there are three separate x-values, it&#x27;s three distinct real roots. Therefore, in both symmetric and asymmetric cases, statement (b) holds.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) with real coefficients, we know that its derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) has three distinct real roots. This implies that \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum (since the leading coefficient is positive, the polynomial tends to \( +\infty \) as \( x \to \pm\infty \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Critical Points and Graph Shape**:
   - The polynomial \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum.
   - The graph of \( f(x) \) will have a &quot;W&quot; shape with two local minima and one local maximum.

2. **Behavior of \( f(x) = k \)**:
   - For \( k \) values greater than the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local maximum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the local maximum and the higher local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has four real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to either local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local minimum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the two local minima, \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - For \( k \) values less than the lower local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.

3. **Evaluation of Statements**:
   - **(a)** False: There is no \( k \) such that \( f(x) = k \) has exactly one real root.
   - **(b)** True: There exists a \( k \) (between the two local minima) where \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - **(c)** False: \( f(x) = k \) does not always have four distinct real roots (e.g., for \( k \) outside the range between the local minima and maximum).
   - **(d)** False: \( f(x) = k \) can have four real roots for some \( k \), so it does not always have two real and two complex roots.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out which of the statements (a), (b), (c), or (d) is true given that the polynomial f(x) = x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d has a derivative f’(x) with three distinct real roots. Let me start by recalling some calculus and polynomial theory.

First, since f(x) is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, its derivative f’(x) is a cubic (degree 3) polynomial. The problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. That means the derivative has three distinct critical points where the slope of f(x) is zero. For a cubic polynomial to have three distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive, but I might not need to compute that here. The key takeaway is that the original function f(x) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum, or two local maxima and one local minimum. Since the derivative is a cubic with three real roots, it must alternate between increasing and decreasing appropriately.

Now, the graph of a quartic polynomial typically has a &quot;W&quot; shape or an &quot;M&quot; shape depending on the leading coefficient. Since the leading term here is x⁴, which has a positive coefficient, as x approaches positive or negative infinity, f(x) tends to positive infinity. Therefore, the graph will eventually rise on both ends. Given that the derivative has three real roots, there are three critical points. For a quartic with positive leading coefficient, the typical shape with three critical points would be two local minima and one local maximum in between. So, the graph would go up, then down, then up, then down, then up again? Wait, no. Wait, the derivative is cubic, so it can have three critical points. So the original function f(x) will have three turning points. Since it&#x27;s a quartic, it can have up to three turning points (since the derivative is cubic, which can have up to three roots). So with three critical points, the graph of f(x) will have two local minima and one local maximum, or two maxima and one minima. But given that the leading coefficient is positive, as x approaches ±∞, f(x) goes to +∞. Therefore, the rightmost and leftmost critical points must be minima. So the structure would be: starting from the left, the function decreases to a local maximum, then increases to a local minimum, then decreases again to a local maximum, and then increases to infinity? Wait, that doesn&#x27;t make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if the derivative has three real roots, then the original function f(x) has three critical points. Let me label them as x₁ &lt; x₂ &lt; x₃. Since the leading term is positive, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, and the same as x approaches -infty. So, the rightmost critical point x₃ must be a local minimum (since after that, the function increases to infinity), and the leftmost critical point x₁ must be a local maximum (since coming from -infty, the function is decreasing until x₁, then starts increasing). Wait, no, that seems contradictory. Let me check:

If x approaches -infty, f(x) tends to +infty, so as we move from left to right (from -infty to +infty), the function starts at +infty, then at some point x₁ (the leftmost critical point) it might turn. If x₁ is a local maximum, then after x₁, the function decreases. Then, at x₂, another critical point, which would have to be a local minimum, so after x₂, the function increases again. Then at x₃, another critical point, which would be a local maximum, and then after x₃, the function decreases. But wait, but after x₃, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, which is a contradiction because if x₃ is a local maximum, then after x₃, the function should decrease, but it actually needs to increase to +infty. Therefore, that can&#x27;t be. Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the leftmost critical point x₁ is a local minimum. Let&#x27;s see: starting from -infty, f(x) is going to +infty. Then at x₁, which is a local minimum, the function starts increasing. Then at x₂, a local maximum, so after x₂, the function decreases. Then at x₃, another local minimum, so after x₃, the function increases again towards +infty. That makes sense. So the critical points are arranged as local minimum at x₁, local maximum at x₂, local minimum at x₃. Therefore, the graph has two local minima and one local maximum.

So the function f(x) would start at +infty, decrease to a local minimum at x₁, then increase to a local maximum at x₂, then decrease to a local minimum at x₃, and then increase again to +infty. So, the graph would look like a &quot;W&quot; but with the middle peak being a local maximum and the two valleys being local minima. So, the function has two local minima and one local maximum.

Given that structure, let&#x27;s consider the possible number of real roots for f(x) = k. Depending on the value of k, the horizontal line y = k can intersect the graph of f(x) in different ways.

If k is greater than the value of the local maximum at x₂, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃, because the function only exceeds k on the far left and far right.

If k is exactly equal to the value of the local maximum at x₂, then f(x) = k would have three real roots: one at x₂ (with multiplicity two, since it&#x27;s a local maximum) and one on each side (left of x₁ and right of x₃). But wait, if the local maximum is exactly at k, then the graph touches the line y = k at x₂, so that&#x27;s a double root, and crosses the line on either side. So three real roots, but one of them is a double root.

If k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two local minima, then suppose the local minima at x₁ and x₃ have values m₁ and m₃. Let&#x27;s assume that one of the minima is lower than the other. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, both minima must be below the local maximum. However, depending on the specific coefficients, one minimum could be lower than the other. Let&#x27;s say, without loss of generality, that m₁ &lt; m₃ (the left local minimum is lower than the right local minimum). Then, if k is between m₃ and the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots: two on the left side (between -infty and x₁, and between x₁ and x₂), and two on the right side (between x₂ and x₃, and between x₃ and +infty). Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two minima, say between M and m₃ (assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), then when k is in (m₃, M), the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. But actually, when you have two minima and one maximum, the graph goes from +infty to m₁ (local min), rises to M (local max), then falls to m₃ (local min), then rises again to +infty. So if k is between m₁ and M, then depending on where k is relative to m₃, the number of roots changes.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch a rough graph mentally. Starting from the left (x approaching -infty), f(x) is at +infty, decreases to m₁ at x₁ (local min), then increases to M at x₂ (local max), then decreases to m₃ at x₃ (local min), then increases back to +infty.

So, if k is greater than M, then the equation f(x) = k has two real roots: one on the far left and one on the far right.

If k is equal to M, then it has three real roots: one at x₂ (a double root) and one on each side.

If k is between m₃ and M, then it has four real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, one between x₂ and x₃, and one right of x₃.

If k is equal to m₃, then it has three real roots: one at x₃ (double root) and one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂.

If k is between m₁ and m₃, then it has two real roots: one left of x₁ and one right of x₃, because the horizontal line y = k only intersects the graph on the leftmost and rightmost ascending parts. Wait, but between x₁ and x₃, the function reaches a maximum at x₂, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, then the line y = k would cross the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. Wait, but if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the minima, but since m₁ is lower than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ to M, so it must cross y = k once there. Similarly, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then since m₃ is higher than m₁, and k is between m₁ and m₃, then on the interval x₂ to x₃, the function decreases from M to m₃, crossing y = k once. Similarly, on the interval x₃ to +infty, the function increases from m₃ to +infty, so y = k would cross once there. Similarly, on the interval -infty to x₁, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, crossing y = k once. Therefore, actually, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots. If k is equal to m₁, then it&#x27;s a double root at x₁ and another root on the right. Similarly, if k is equal to m₃, it&#x27;s a double root at x₃ and another root on the left. If k is less than m₁, since m₁ is the lower of the two minima, then the line y = k would intersect the graph only twice: once left of x₁ and once right of x₃. Wait, no. If k is less than m₁, which is the minimum, then the graph only reaches down to m₁, so y = k would not intersect the graph at all? Wait, no. Wait, as x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches +infty, and at x₁, it&#x27;s a local minimum m₁. So if k &lt; m₁, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃? Wait, but if k is less than m₁, which is the minimum value on the left side, then on the left side, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, so it must cross y = k once. On the right side, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is higher than m₁) up to +infty, so if k is less than m₁, then since m₃ is greater than m₁, and k is less than m₁, then on the right side, the function starts at m₃ (which is greater than k) and increases to infinity, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, if k &lt; m₁, there is only one real root on the left side. Similarly, if k &gt; M, there are two real roots on the extremes. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to tabulate the different cases.

Let me denote:

- The leftmost local minimum at x = x₁ with f(x₁) = m₁.

- The local maximum at x = x₂ with f(x₂) = M.

- The rightmost local minimum at x = x₃ with f(x₃) = m₃.

Assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ (since x₁ &lt; x₃ and the function might have asymmetrical minima), though it could also be m₃ &lt; m₁. Wait, but since the function is going from m₁ up to M, then down to m₃, and then up again. The relative positions of m₁ and m₃ depend on the specific coefficients. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify, so I can&#x27;t assume which is lower. Therefore, perhaps I need to consider both possibilities. But maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter. Let&#x27;s suppose m₁ ≤ m₃ for definiteness. Then:

- If k &gt; M: two real roots (left and right).

- If k = M: three real roots (one double root at x₂ and two simple roots on the sides).

- If m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots (left, between x₁ and x₂, between x₂ and x₃, right).

- If k = m₃: three real roots (double root at x₃ and two others).

- If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: four real roots (similar to above? Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, but the function between x₁ and x₂ goes up to M, which is higher than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function crosses y = k once (since it goes from m₁ to M), between x₂ and x₃, it crosses once (since it goes from M to m₃), and on both ends, left of x₁ and right of x₃, the function is above k? Wait, no. Wait, the left end (x approaching -infty) is +infty, so coming from the left, the function starts at +infty, decreases to m₁ (which is less than k, since k &gt; m₁), so it must cross y = k once on the left side (before x₁). Then, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross there. Wait, but m₃ is greater than k, so after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so if m₃ &gt; k, then it never crosses y = k again. Therefore, in this case, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k has three real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, and one between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought.

Wait, perhaps I need to more carefully analyze:

Case 1: k &gt; M. Then, the horizontal line y = k cuts the graph at two points: one far left (before x₁) and one far right (after x₃).

Case 2: k = M. The line touches the local maximum at x₂ and cuts the graph on the left and right sides, resulting in three real roots (one double root at x₂).

Case 3: m₃ &lt; k &lt; M. The line y = k intersects the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃.

Wait, but if m₃ is the right local minimum, and k is greater than m₃ but less than M, then after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so since k &gt; m₃, there will be a crossing right of x₃. Similarly, left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is less than k (since k &gt; m₃ and m₃ &gt; m₁, so k &gt; m₁). Therefore, left of x₁, the function crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ (which is less than k) up to M (which is greater than k), so crosses once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is less than k), so crosses once. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to infinity, crossing once. Therefore, four crossings. So that&#x27;s four real roots.

Case 4: k = m₃. The line touches the local minimum at x₃, so it&#x27;s a double root there, and crosses the graph left of x₁ and between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so at k = m₃, it only touches at x₃. Therefore, the roots would be left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂ (since the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing k = m₃ if m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), but wait, m₃ is the value at x₃, which is a local minimum. If k = m₃, then between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so it reaches m₃ at x₃. Therefore, if k = m₃, then there&#x27;s a root at x₃ (double root) and another root left of x₁ (since the function decreases from +infty to m₁, which is less than m₃, so crosses y = m₃ once left of x₁) and another root between x₁ and x₂ (as the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing y = m₃ once). So total of three roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and a double root at x₃.

Case 5: m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃. Here, k is between the two local minima. Since m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum. Let&#x27;s assume m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph as follows:

- Left of x₁: the function comes down from +infty to m₁, which is less than k, so it crosses y = k once.

- Between x₁ and x₂: the function goes from m₁ (less than k) up to M (greater than k), so crosses once.

- Between x₂ and x₃: the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so crosses once.

- Right of x₃: the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = k there.

Therefore, total of three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃.

Wait, but hold on. If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃, then m₃ is greater than k, so right of x₃, the function starts at m₃ and goes up, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, only three real roots? But earlier, when k is between m₃ and M, we had four roots. Hmm.

Case 6: k = m₁. The line touches the left local minimum at x₁, resulting in a double root there. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than m₁), so if k = m₁, which is less than m₃, the function crosses y = k once between x₂ and x₃. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ to +infty, which is above k, so no crossing. Also, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M, so crosses y = k once. Wait, but if k = m₁, then between x₁ and x₂, the function starts at m₁ (k) and goes up, so the crossing is exactly at x₁, which is a double root. Then, another crossing between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, three real roots: double root at x₁ and single roots between x₂ and x₃ and right of x₃? Wait, no. Wait, if k = m₁, then at x₁, the function has a local minimum. So the graph touches y = k at x₁, and then goes up. On the left side, as x approaches -infty, the function approaches +infty, so it comes down from +infty to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, left of x₁, there&#x27;s no crossing since it&#x27;s decreasing to m₁. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root because it&#x27;s a local minimum). Then, moving from x₁ to x₂, the function increases to M, which is greater than m₁, so there&#x27;s no crossing there. Then, from x₂ to x₃, the function decreases to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Then, from x₃ to +infty, the function increases to +infty, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = m₁ again. Therefore, total of two real roots: a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but the original function at x approaching -infty is +infty, so when approaching from the left, the function decreases to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, for k = m₁, the leftmost intersection is exactly at x₁ (a double root), and then another intersection between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, two real roots (one double, one single). But in the context of the problem, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot; or &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, do they count multiplicity? The problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for option (a). If they count multiplicity, then at k = m₁, f(x) = k has two real roots (one double, one single). If they don&#x27;t count multiplicity, then maybe it&#x27;s considered as two real roots (but one is a double root). Wait, the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;. So if multiplicity is considered, then a double root would count as one root, but actually, in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s still one. Wait, no. Wait, multiplicity is about the number of roots counting multiplicity. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, which might mean exactly one distinct real root, or exactly one real root counting multiplicity. The question is ambiguous, but in standard terminology, &quot;exactly one real root&quot; usually refers to exactly one distinct real root, but in some contexts, it might count multiplicity. However, in options (b) and (c), they mention &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; and &quot;four distinct real roots&quot;, so it seems like they are distinguishing between distinct roots and multiple roots. Therefore, for (a), &quot;exactly one real root&quot; probably means exactly one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. Similarly, for (b), &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;. So in the case where k = m₁, we have a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃, so that&#x27;s two distinct real roots (x₁ with multiplicity two and another root). Therefore, (a) is not satisfied here.

Case 7: k &lt; m₁. Then, the horizontal line y = k is below both local minima. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, the line y = k would intersect the graph twice: once on the far left (before x₁) and once on the far right (after x₃). Therefore, two real roots.

So summarizing:

- k &gt; M: two real roots.

- k = M: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots.

- k = m₃: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: three real roots.

- k = m₁: three real roots (one double, two simple? Wait, earlier analysis said two roots, but maybe I messed up).

Wait, let me re-examine k = m₁. If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root) and since between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, total of two distinct real roots: x₁ (double) and one between x₂ and x₃. So, in terms of distinct roots, two; in terms of total roots counting multiplicity, three. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for (a). If &quot;exactly one&quot; means one distinct root, then even if it&#x27;s a double root, that would still be considered one real root. But in standard terminology, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, they usually mean one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. However, in the case of k = M, we have three real roots but one is a double root. The problem&#x27;s option (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, so distinctness is important there. So, for (a), if there exists a k where f(x) = k has exactly one real root (distinct or not?), the answer depends on that.

But in the case where k is less than m₁, we have two distinct real roots. If k is equal to m₁, we have two real roots (x₁ is a double root, and another one). If k is between m₁ and m₃, three real roots. If k is equal to m₃ or M, three real roots (with a double root). If k is between m₃ and M, four real roots. If k is greater than M, two real roots.

Wait, but in none of these cases do we have exactly one real root. Even when k is less than m₁, we have two real roots. When k equals m₁ or m₃ or M, we have two or three real roots but with multiplicities. So, there is no k for which f(x) = k has exactly one real root, right? Unless when the polynomial is tangent to the line y = k at one point and doesn&#x27;t cross it elsewhere, but given the shape of the quartic, which tends to +infty on both sides, if the horizontal line is tangent at the local maximum or one of the minima, it will still cross the graph on one side or the other. Wait, for example, if k is equal to the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = M has a double root at x₂ and two other roots on the left and right. Wait, no. Wait, at k = M, the horizontal line touches the local maximum at x₂. To the left of x₂, the function is increasing from m₁ to M, so it only reaches M at x₂. To the right of x₂, the function decreases from M to m₃ and then increases again. Therefore, the line y = M would intersect the graph only at x₂ (a double root) and on the right side as the function increases past M again? Wait, no. Wait, after x₃, the function increases from m₃ to +infty. If M is the local maximum, then m₃ is less than M. So, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is less than M) up to +infty, so it must cross y = M once after x₃. Similarly, to the left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁ (which is less than M), so it must cross y = M once before x₁. Therefore, when k = M, the equation f(x) = M has three real roots: one at x₂ (double root) and one on each side. Therefore, three distinct real roots? Wait, but x₂ is a double root, so in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s three: x₂, and one on each side. So multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect distinctness. Therefore, even though x₂ is a double root, it&#x27;s still one distinct root. So in that case, k = M gives three distinct real roots, with one of them being a double root. Wait, no. If a root is a double root, it&#x27;s still a single distinct root; the distinctness refers to the x-values. So x₂ is one distinct root, and the other two are also distinct. So in total, three distinct real roots, one with multiplicity two. Therefore, for the problem&#x27;s option (b): &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Well, when k = M or k = m₁ or k = m₃, you have three real roots, but with one double root. But the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would require all three roots to be distinct, i.e., no multiple roots. So in that case, even though at k = M you have three real roots, one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. Therefore, the answer would be that statement (b) is false. Wait, but when k is between m₃ and M, we have four distinct real roots. When k is between m₁ and m₃, three distinct real roots. When k is less than m₁ or greater than M, two distinct real roots. When k equals M, m₁, or m₃, three real roots with one double root.

Therefore, the statement (b) says: &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Given that when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three distinct real roots (as per the earlier analysis). Wait, earlier I thought when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three real roots. Wait, let&#x27;s recheck.

Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two local minima, then depending on the graph, how does the horizontal line intersect? Suppose m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum, with m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, k between m₁ and m₃ would be above m₁ and below m₃. Then, on the left side (x &lt; x₁), the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is below k, so it crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is above k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross. Therefore, three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots because they are in different intervals. Therefore, statement (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima, we get three distinct real roots. Additionally, if m₁ &gt; m₃, then similar logic applies, just switch left and right.

Therefore, regardless of the relative positions of the minima, there exists a k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Therefore, option (b) is true.

But wait, the answer options are (a), (b), (c), (d). Let&#x27;s check the options again:

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

From the analysis above:

- (a) is false because for any real k, f(x) = k has either two, three, or four real roots. There is no k where it has exactly one real root.

- (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima (or between the higher local minimum and the local maximum, but actually in our case, between m₁ and m₃, assuming m₁ &lt; m₃), the equation f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

Wait, earlier, when k is between m₁ and m₃, which are both minima, the horizontal line y = k intersects the graph three times: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots.

- (c) is false because when k is greater than M or less than m₁ (the lower of the two minima), f(x) = k has only two real roots.

- (d) is false because when k is between the two local minima or between a local minimum and the local maximum, f(x) = k has four or three real roots, respectively, so not always two real and two complex roots.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

But wait, the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, and the options are (a)-(d). The analysis above suggests that (b) is true. However, in the initial problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots. Wait, but in our analysis, we concluded that between the two local minima, we can get three real roots. But the key is that the quartic has three critical points: two minima and one maximum or two maxima and one minima, but in this case, with leading coefficient positive, it&#x27;s two minima and one maximum.

But let me verify with an example. Take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x + 1. Wait, maybe a simpler example. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 2x³ - 3x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 6x² - 6x. Let&#x27;s find the critical points.

Wait, maybe a better example is f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has three real roots: x = 0, x = sqrt(2), x = -sqrt(2). So the critical points are at x = -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). Then f(x) at these points: f(-sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(2))⁴ - 4*(sqrt(2))² = 4 - 8 = -4. f(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. f(sqrt(2)) = same as f(-sqrt(2)) = -4. So the local minima are at x = ±sqrt(2) with f(x) = -4, and the local maximum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0. So this is a symmetric quartic. Then, for k between -4 and 0, f(x) = k has four real roots. For k = 0, it has three real roots (double root at x = 0 and two at ±sqrt(something)). For k &lt; -4, two real roots. For k &gt; 0, two real roots. For k between the minima and the maximum (i.e., between -4 and 0), four real roots. For k exactly at -4, three real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). Wait, but in this case, the two minima are equal. So here, m₁ = m₃ = -4. Therefore, there is no interval between m₁ and m₃; they are the same. Therefore, in this symmetric case, when k is between -4 and 0, you get four real roots, but when k is exactly -4, you get two real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). However, the original problem states that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does: -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). So in this case, the two minima are equal. Therefore, if the two local minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are equal), so the three real roots case doesn&#x27;t occur. Wait, but the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; for f’(x). In this example, f’(x) has three distinct real roots. But in this case, the minima are equal, so between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, you get four real roots. But if the minima are not equal, then between them, you would have three real roots.

Therefore, the key is whether the two local minima can be at different heights. If f’(x) has three distinct real roots, but the function f(x) could still have two equal minima. Wait, but in the example above, even with symmetric critical points, the minima are equal. So perhaps, depending on the coefficients, the minima can be equal or not. Therefore, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether the minima are equal or not, only that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Therefore, in some cases, you might have equal minima, in others not. Therefore, the answer would depend on whether, regardless of the specific f(x) meeting the condition, statement (b) is always true.

But wait, in the example where minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are the same), so the three real roots case would not exist. However, in that case, when k is between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, which is the same as saying between m and M, you get four real roots. When k is less than m or greater than M, you get two real roots. When k equals m, you get two double roots. When k equals M, you get three real roots (a double root and two simple roots). Therefore, in the symmetric case, statement (b) is false because there is no k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. When k = M, you have three real roots but one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. When k is between m and M, you have four distinct real roots. When k is less than m, two distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric case, statement (b) is false. But the problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does, but the minima are equal. Therefore, the correct answer would not always be (b). Therefore, my previous analysis was incorrect.

Therefore, there&#x27;s a problem: if the quartic is symmetric, with two equal minima, then there is no k for which f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) would not hold in such cases. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot; given that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Since there exist such polynomials where statement (b) is false, but there also exist polynomials where statement (b) is true. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the statement must hold for all such polynomials or if there exists at least one. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, implying that the statement must be always true given the conditions.

Therefore, since there exists a polynomial where f’(x) has three distinct real roots but there&#x27;s no k with three distinct real roots (like the symmetric quartic example), statement (b) is not always true. Therefore, my previous conclusion was wrong.

Then, what is the correct answer? Let&#x27;s re-examine the options.

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

In the symmetric example, the only possible numbers of real roots are two (k &lt; m), four (m &lt; k &lt; M), three (k = m or k = M), or two (k &gt; M). So in this case, there is no k with exactly one real root. Therefore, statement (a) is false.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric example, when k = m or k = M, we have three real roots but with a double root, so they are not distinct. Therefore, in this case, there is no k with three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) is false.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

False, since for k &gt; M or k &lt; m, there are only two real roots.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

False, since for some k, there are four real roots.

Therefore, in this case, none of the options are true? But that can&#x27;t be, because the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the symmetric example. Let&#x27;s take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has roots at x = 0, sqrt(2), -sqrt(2). So three distinct real roots. The function f(x) = x⁴ - 4x² has local maxima at x = 0 (f(0) = 0) and local minima at x = ±sqrt(2) (f(±sqrt(2)) = -4). Then, for k = -4, the equation f(x) = -4 has double roots at x = ±sqrt(2). For k = 0, it has a double root at x = 0 and simple roots at x = ±2. So, in this case, when k = 0, the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. Therefore, three real roots, but only two distinct ones (x = 0 and x = ±2). Wait, no. If x = ±2 are roots, then total roots are x = 0 (double), x = 2, and x = -2. So four roots total, but with x = 0 counted twice. However, the equation x⁴ - 4x² = 0 factors as x²(x² - 4) = 0, so roots at x = 0 (multiplicity 2), x = 2, x = -2. So in this case, for k = 0, there are three distinct real roots (0, 2, -2), with one of them being a double root. Therefore, in terms of distinct real roots, it&#x27;s three. So, statement (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would be true here because even though 0 is a double root, the roots are still distinct: -2, 0, 2. So in this case, k = 0 gives three distinct real roots, even with a double root at 0. Therefore, perhaps in this example, statement (b) is true.

Wait, but if we take k = -4, then f(x) = -4 has roots at x = ±sqrt(2), each with multiplicity two. So, two distinct real roots, each a double root. Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is not satisfied for k = -4, but for k = 0, we have three distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric example, there does exist a k (specifically k = 0) such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) is true.

But earlier, I thought that when the minima are equal, there&#x27;s no k between them, but in reality, even in the symmetric case, there is a k (the local maximum) where you have three distinct real roots. So regardless of whether the minima are equal or not, the local maximum will always provide a k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Let me check.

In the symmetric example, at k = 0 (the local maximum), the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double root) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) holds.

If we take another example where the minima are not equal. Let’s construct a quartic with two unequal minima. For example, f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x. Compute its derivative: f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x² + 4x + 4. I need to check if this derivative has three distinct real roots. Instead of computing, maybe take a known quartic. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 6x² + 4x. Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x + 4. Let&#x27;s check the roots of f’(x). Maybe this cubic has three real roots. Alternatively, use f(x) = x⁴ - 3x³ - 3x² + 4x + 1. Not sure. Alternatively, take f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4), but that would have four real roots, but its derivative would have three critical points. However, expanding this would be time-consuming.

Alternatively, take a quartic with two minima at different heights. Suppose f(x) has a local minimum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0, a local maximum at x = 1 with f(1) = 2, and another local minimum at x = 2 with f(2) = 1. Then, the function would go from +infty down to 0 at x = 0, up to 2 at x = 1, down to 1 at x = 2, and back up to +infty. In this case, m₁ = 0, M = 2, m₃ = 1. Then, for k between m₁ = 0 and m₃ = 1, the equation f(x) = k would have three distinct real roots: one left of 0, one between 0 and 1, and one between 1 and 2. For k between m₃ = 1 and M = 2, four distinct real roots. For k = 1, three real roots (double root at x = 2 and two others). For k = 0, three real roots (double root at x = 0 and one other). For k = 2, three real roots (double root at x = 1 and two others). For k &lt; 0, two real roots; for k &gt; 2, two real roots.

Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k between 0 and 1 (the two minima) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric case, even though the minima are equal, there&#x27;s still a k = M where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots (with a double root at the local maximum). Wait, no. In the symmetric case, k = M is the local maximum. For example, in f(x) = x⁴ - 4x², the local maximum is at x = 0 with k = 0. The equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, even in the symmetric case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k (specifically k = M) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Even though one of them is a double root, but the roots are still distinct in terms of their x-values. Wait, no. A double root at x = 0 means that x = 0 is a repeated root, but the distinct roots are x = -2, x = 0, x = 2. Therefore, three distinct real roots. The multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect the distinctness. Therefore, even if there is a multiple root, as long as there are three separate x-values, it&#x27;s three distinct real roots. Therefore, in both symmetric and asymmetric cases, statement (b) holds.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) with real coefficients, we know that its derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) has three distinct real roots. This implies that \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum (since the leading coefficient is positive, the polynomial tends to \( +\infty \) as \( x \to \pm\infty \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Critical Points and Graph Shape**:
   - The polynomial \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum.
   - The graph of \( f(x) \) will have a &quot;W&quot; shape with two local minima and one local maximum.

2. **Behavior of \( f(x) = k \)**:
   - For \( k \) values greater than the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local maximum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the local maximum and the higher local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has four real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to either local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local minimum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the two local minima, \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - For \( k \) values less than the lower local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.

3. **Evaluation of Statements**:
   - **(a)** False: There is no \( k \) such that \( f(x) = k \) has exactly one real root.
   - **(b)** True: There exists a \( k \) (between the two local minima) where \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - **(c)** False: \( f(x) = k \) does not always have four distinct real roots (e.g., for \( k \) outside the range between the local minima and maximum).
   - **(d)** False: \( f(x) = k \) can have four real roots for some \( k \), so it does not always have two real and two complex roots.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out which of the statements (a), (b), (c), or (d) is true given that the polynomial f(x) = x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d has a derivative f’(x) with three distinct real roots. Let me start by recalling some calculus and polynomial theory.

First, since f(x) is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, its derivative f’(x) is a cubic (degree 3) polynomial. The problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. That means the derivative has three distinct critical points where the slope of f(x) is zero. For a cubic polynomial to have three distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive, but I might not need to compute that here. The key takeaway is that the original function f(x) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum, or two local maxima and one local minimum. Since the derivative is a cubic with three real roots, it must alternate between increasing and decreasing appropriately.

Now, the graph of a quartic polynomial typically has a &quot;W&quot; shape or an &quot;M&quot; shape depending on the leading coefficient. Since the leading term here is x⁴, which has a positive coefficient, as x approaches positive or negative infinity, f(x) tends to positive infinity. Therefore, the graph will eventually rise on both ends. Given that the derivative has three real roots, there are three critical points. For a quartic with positive leading coefficient, the typical shape with three critical points would be two local minima and one local maximum in between. So, the graph would go up, then down, then up, then down, then up again? Wait, no. Wait, the derivative is cubic, so it can have three critical points. So the original function f(x) will have three turning points. Since it&#x27;s a quartic, it can have up to three turning points (since the derivative is cubic, which can have up to three roots). So with three critical points, the graph of f(x) will have two local minima and one local maximum, or two maxima and one minima. But given that the leading coefficient is positive, as x approaches ±∞, f(x) goes to +∞. Therefore, the rightmost and leftmost critical points must be minima. So the structure would be: starting from the left, the function decreases to a local maximum, then increases to a local minimum, then decreases again to a local maximum, and then increases to infinity? Wait, that doesn&#x27;t make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if the derivative has three real roots, then the original function f(x) has three critical points. Let me label them as x₁ &lt; x₂ &lt; x₃. Since the leading term is positive, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, and the same as x approaches -infty. So, the rightmost critical point x₃ must be a local minimum (since after that, the function increases to infinity), and the leftmost critical point x₁ must be a local maximum (since coming from -infty, the function is decreasing until x₁, then starts increasing). Wait, no, that seems contradictory. Let me check:

If x approaches -infty, f(x) tends to +infty, so as we move from left to right (from -infty to +infty), the function starts at +infty, then at some point x₁ (the leftmost critical point) it might turn. If x₁ is a local maximum, then after x₁, the function decreases. Then, at x₂, another critical point, which would have to be a local minimum, so after x₂, the function increases again. Then at x₃, another critical point, which would be a local maximum, and then after x₃, the function decreases. But wait, but after x₃, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, which is a contradiction because if x₃ is a local maximum, then after x₃, the function should decrease, but it actually needs to increase to +infty. Therefore, that can&#x27;t be. Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the leftmost critical point x₁ is a local minimum. Let&#x27;s see: starting from -infty, f(x) is going to +infty. Then at x₁, which is a local minimum, the function starts increasing. Then at x₂, a local maximum, so after x₂, the function decreases. Then at x₃, another local minimum, so after x₃, the function increases again towards +infty. That makes sense. So the critical points are arranged as local minimum at x₁, local maximum at x₂, local minimum at x₃. Therefore, the graph has two local minima and one local maximum.

So the function f(x) would start at +infty, decrease to a local minimum at x₁, then increase to a local maximum at x₂, then decrease to a local minimum at x₃, and then increase again to +infty. So, the graph would look like a &quot;W&quot; but with the middle peak being a local maximum and the two valleys being local minima. So, the function has two local minima and one local maximum.

Given that structure, let&#x27;s consider the possible number of real roots for f(x) = k. Depending on the value of k, the horizontal line y = k can intersect the graph of f(x) in different ways.

If k is greater than the value of the local maximum at x₂, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃, because the function only exceeds k on the far left and far right.

If k is exactly equal to the value of the local maximum at x₂, then f(x) = k would have three real roots: one at x₂ (with multiplicity two, since it&#x27;s a local maximum) and one on each side (left of x₁ and right of x₃). But wait, if the local maximum is exactly at k, then the graph touches the line y = k at x₂, so that&#x27;s a double root, and crosses the line on either side. So three real roots, but one of them is a double root.

If k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two local minima, then suppose the local minima at x₁ and x₃ have values m₁ and m₃. Let&#x27;s assume that one of the minima is lower than the other. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, both minima must be below the local maximum. However, depending on the specific coefficients, one minimum could be lower than the other. Let&#x27;s say, without loss of generality, that m₁ &lt; m₃ (the left local minimum is lower than the right local minimum). Then, if k is between m₃ and the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots: two on the left side (between -infty and x₁, and between x₁ and x₂), and two on the right side (between x₂ and x₃, and between x₃ and +infty). Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two minima, say between M and m₃ (assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), then when k is in (m₃, M), the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. But actually, when you have two minima and one maximum, the graph goes from +infty to m₁ (local min), rises to M (local max), then falls to m₃ (local min), then rises again to +infty. So if k is between m₁ and M, then depending on where k is relative to m₃, the number of roots changes.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch a rough graph mentally. Starting from the left (x approaching -infty), f(x) is at +infty, decreases to m₁ at x₁ (local min), then increases to M at x₂ (local max), then decreases to m₃ at x₃ (local min), then increases back to +infty.

So, if k is greater than M, then the equation f(x) = k has two real roots: one on the far left and one on the far right.

If k is equal to M, then it has three real roots: one at x₂ (a double root) and one on each side.

If k is between m₃ and M, then it has four real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, one between x₂ and x₃, and one right of x₃.

If k is equal to m₃, then it has three real roots: one at x₃ (double root) and one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂.

If k is between m₁ and m₃, then it has two real roots: one left of x₁ and one right of x₃, because the horizontal line y = k only intersects the graph on the leftmost and rightmost ascending parts. Wait, but between x₁ and x₃, the function reaches a maximum at x₂, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, then the line y = k would cross the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. Wait, but if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the minima, but since m₁ is lower than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ to M, so it must cross y = k once there. Similarly, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then since m₃ is higher than m₁, and k is between m₁ and m₃, then on the interval x₂ to x₃, the function decreases from M to m₃, crossing y = k once. Similarly, on the interval x₃ to +infty, the function increases from m₃ to +infty, so y = k would cross once there. Similarly, on the interval -infty to x₁, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, crossing y = k once. Therefore, actually, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots. If k is equal to m₁, then it&#x27;s a double root at x₁ and another root on the right. Similarly, if k is equal to m₃, it&#x27;s a double root at x₃ and another root on the left. If k is less than m₁, since m₁ is the lower of the two minima, then the line y = k would intersect the graph only twice: once left of x₁ and once right of x₃. Wait, no. If k is less than m₁, which is the minimum, then the graph only reaches down to m₁, so y = k would not intersect the graph at all? Wait, no. Wait, as x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches +infty, and at x₁, it&#x27;s a local minimum m₁. So if k &lt; m₁, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃? Wait, but if k is less than m₁, which is the minimum value on the left side, then on the left side, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, so it must cross y = k once. On the right side, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is higher than m₁) up to +infty, so if k is less than m₁, then since m₃ is greater than m₁, and k is less than m₁, then on the right side, the function starts at m₃ (which is greater than k) and increases to infinity, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, if k &lt; m₁, there is only one real root on the left side. Similarly, if k &gt; M, there are two real roots on the extremes. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to tabulate the different cases.

Let me denote:

- The leftmost local minimum at x = x₁ with f(x₁) = m₁.

- The local maximum at x = x₂ with f(x₂) = M.

- The rightmost local minimum at x = x₃ with f(x₃) = m₃.

Assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ (since x₁ &lt; x₃ and the function might have asymmetrical minima), though it could also be m₃ &lt; m₁. Wait, but since the function is going from m₁ up to M, then down to m₃, and then up again. The relative positions of m₁ and m₃ depend on the specific coefficients. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify, so I can&#x27;t assume which is lower. Therefore, perhaps I need to consider both possibilities. But maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter. Let&#x27;s suppose m₁ ≤ m₃ for definiteness. Then:

- If k &gt; M: two real roots (left and right).

- If k = M: three real roots (one double root at x₂ and two simple roots on the sides).

- If m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots (left, between x₁ and x₂, between x₂ and x₃, right).

- If k = m₃: three real roots (double root at x₃ and two others).

- If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: four real roots (similar to above? Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, but the function between x₁ and x₂ goes up to M, which is higher than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function crosses y = k once (since it goes from m₁ to M), between x₂ and x₃, it crosses once (since it goes from M to m₃), and on both ends, left of x₁ and right of x₃, the function is above k? Wait, no. Wait, the left end (x approaching -infty) is +infty, so coming from the left, the function starts at +infty, decreases to m₁ (which is less than k, since k &gt; m₁), so it must cross y = k once on the left side (before x₁). Then, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross there. Wait, but m₃ is greater than k, so after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so if m₃ &gt; k, then it never crosses y = k again. Therefore, in this case, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k has three real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, and one between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought.

Wait, perhaps I need to more carefully analyze:

Case 1: k &gt; M. Then, the horizontal line y = k cuts the graph at two points: one far left (before x₁) and one far right (after x₃).

Case 2: k = M. The line touches the local maximum at x₂ and cuts the graph on the left and right sides, resulting in three real roots (one double root at x₂).

Case 3: m₃ &lt; k &lt; M. The line y = k intersects the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃.

Wait, but if m₃ is the right local minimum, and k is greater than m₃ but less than M, then after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so since k &gt; m₃, there will be a crossing right of x₃. Similarly, left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is less than k (since k &gt; m₃ and m₃ &gt; m₁, so k &gt; m₁). Therefore, left of x₁, the function crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ (which is less than k) up to M (which is greater than k), so crosses once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is less than k), so crosses once. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to infinity, crossing once. Therefore, four crossings. So that&#x27;s four real roots.

Case 4: k = m₃. The line touches the local minimum at x₃, so it&#x27;s a double root there, and crosses the graph left of x₁ and between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so at k = m₃, it only touches at x₃. Therefore, the roots would be left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂ (since the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing k = m₃ if m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), but wait, m₃ is the value at x₃, which is a local minimum. If k = m₃, then between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so it reaches m₃ at x₃. Therefore, if k = m₃, then there&#x27;s a root at x₃ (double root) and another root left of x₁ (since the function decreases from +infty to m₁, which is less than m₃, so crosses y = m₃ once left of x₁) and another root between x₁ and x₂ (as the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing y = m₃ once). So total of three roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and a double root at x₃.

Case 5: m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃. Here, k is between the two local minima. Since m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum. Let&#x27;s assume m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph as follows:

- Left of x₁: the function comes down from +infty to m₁, which is less than k, so it crosses y = k once.

- Between x₁ and x₂: the function goes from m₁ (less than k) up to M (greater than k), so crosses once.

- Between x₂ and x₃: the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so crosses once.

- Right of x₃: the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = k there.

Therefore, total of three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃.

Wait, but hold on. If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃, then m₃ is greater than k, so right of x₃, the function starts at m₃ and goes up, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, only three real roots? But earlier, when k is between m₃ and M, we had four roots. Hmm.

Case 6: k = m₁. The line touches the left local minimum at x₁, resulting in a double root there. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than m₁), so if k = m₁, which is less than m₃, the function crosses y = k once between x₂ and x₃. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ to +infty, which is above k, so no crossing. Also, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M, so crosses y = k once. Wait, but if k = m₁, then between x₁ and x₂, the function starts at m₁ (k) and goes up, so the crossing is exactly at x₁, which is a double root. Then, another crossing between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, three real roots: double root at x₁ and single roots between x₂ and x₃ and right of x₃? Wait, no. Wait, if k = m₁, then at x₁, the function has a local minimum. So the graph touches y = k at x₁, and then goes up. On the left side, as x approaches -infty, the function approaches +infty, so it comes down from +infty to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, left of x₁, there&#x27;s no crossing since it&#x27;s decreasing to m₁. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root because it&#x27;s a local minimum). Then, moving from x₁ to x₂, the function increases to M, which is greater than m₁, so there&#x27;s no crossing there. Then, from x₂ to x₃, the function decreases to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Then, from x₃ to +infty, the function increases to +infty, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = m₁ again. Therefore, total of two real roots: a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but the original function at x approaching -infty is +infty, so when approaching from the left, the function decreases to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, for k = m₁, the leftmost intersection is exactly at x₁ (a double root), and then another intersection between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, two real roots (one double, one single). But in the context of the problem, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot; or &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, do they count multiplicity? The problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for option (a). If they count multiplicity, then at k = m₁, f(x) = k has two real roots (one double, one single). If they don&#x27;t count multiplicity, then maybe it&#x27;s considered as two real roots (but one is a double root). Wait, the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;. So if multiplicity is considered, then a double root would count as one root, but actually, in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s still one. Wait, no. Wait, multiplicity is about the number of roots counting multiplicity. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, which might mean exactly one distinct real root, or exactly one real root counting multiplicity. The question is ambiguous, but in standard terminology, &quot;exactly one real root&quot; usually refers to exactly one distinct real root, but in some contexts, it might count multiplicity. However, in options (b) and (c), they mention &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; and &quot;four distinct real roots&quot;, so it seems like they are distinguishing between distinct roots and multiple roots. Therefore, for (a), &quot;exactly one real root&quot; probably means exactly one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. Similarly, for (b), &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;. So in the case where k = m₁, we have a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃, so that&#x27;s two distinct real roots (x₁ with multiplicity two and another root). Therefore, (a) is not satisfied here.

Case 7: k &lt; m₁. Then, the horizontal line y = k is below both local minima. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, the line y = k would intersect the graph twice: once on the far left (before x₁) and once on the far right (after x₃). Therefore, two real roots.

So summarizing:

- k &gt; M: two real roots.

- k = M: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots.

- k = m₃: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: three real roots.

- k = m₁: three real roots (one double, two simple? Wait, earlier analysis said two roots, but maybe I messed up).

Wait, let me re-examine k = m₁. If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root) and since between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, total of two distinct real roots: x₁ (double) and one between x₂ and x₃. So, in terms of distinct roots, two; in terms of total roots counting multiplicity, three. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for (a). If &quot;exactly one&quot; means one distinct root, then even if it&#x27;s a double root, that would still be considered one real root. But in standard terminology, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, they usually mean one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. However, in the case of k = M, we have three real roots but one is a double root. The problem&#x27;s option (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, so distinctness is important there. So, for (a), if there exists a k where f(x) = k has exactly one real root (distinct or not?), the answer depends on that.

But in the case where k is less than m₁, we have two distinct real roots. If k is equal to m₁, we have two real roots (x₁ is a double root, and another one). If k is between m₁ and m₃, three real roots. If k is equal to m₃ or M, three real roots (with a double root). If k is between m₃ and M, four real roots. If k is greater than M, two real roots.

Wait, but in none of these cases do we have exactly one real root. Even when k is less than m₁, we have two real roots. When k equals m₁ or m₃ or M, we have two or three real roots but with multiplicities. So, there is no k for which f(x) = k has exactly one real root, right? Unless when the polynomial is tangent to the line y = k at one point and doesn&#x27;t cross it elsewhere, but given the shape of the quartic, which tends to +infty on both sides, if the horizontal line is tangent at the local maximum or one of the minima, it will still cross the graph on one side or the other. Wait, for example, if k is equal to the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = M has a double root at x₂ and two other roots on the left and right. Wait, no. Wait, at k = M, the horizontal line touches the local maximum at x₂. To the left of x₂, the function is increasing from m₁ to M, so it only reaches M at x₂. To the right of x₂, the function decreases from M to m₃ and then increases again. Therefore, the line y = M would intersect the graph only at x₂ (a double root) and on the right side as the function increases past M again? Wait, no. Wait, after x₃, the function increases from m₃ to +infty. If M is the local maximum, then m₃ is less than M. So, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is less than M) up to +infty, so it must cross y = M once after x₃. Similarly, to the left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁ (which is less than M), so it must cross y = M once before x₁. Therefore, when k = M, the equation f(x) = M has three real roots: one at x₂ (double root) and one on each side. Therefore, three distinct real roots? Wait, but x₂ is a double root, so in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s three: x₂, and one on each side. So multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect distinctness. Therefore, even though x₂ is a double root, it&#x27;s still one distinct root. So in that case, k = M gives three distinct real roots, with one of them being a double root. Wait, no. If a root is a double root, it&#x27;s still a single distinct root; the distinctness refers to the x-values. So x₂ is one distinct root, and the other two are also distinct. So in total, three distinct real roots, one with multiplicity two. Therefore, for the problem&#x27;s option (b): &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Well, when k = M or k = m₁ or k = m₃, you have three real roots, but with one double root. But the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would require all three roots to be distinct, i.e., no multiple roots. So in that case, even though at k = M you have three real roots, one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. Therefore, the answer would be that statement (b) is false. Wait, but when k is between m₃ and M, we have four distinct real roots. When k is between m₁ and m₃, three distinct real roots. When k is less than m₁ or greater than M, two distinct real roots. When k equals M, m₁, or m₃, three real roots with one double root.

Therefore, the statement (b) says: &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Given that when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three distinct real roots (as per the earlier analysis). Wait, earlier I thought when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three real roots. Wait, let&#x27;s recheck.

Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two local minima, then depending on the graph, how does the horizontal line intersect? Suppose m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum, with m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, k between m₁ and m₃ would be above m₁ and below m₃. Then, on the left side (x &lt; x₁), the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is below k, so it crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is above k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross. Therefore, three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots because they are in different intervals. Therefore, statement (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima, we get three distinct real roots. Additionally, if m₁ &gt; m₃, then similar logic applies, just switch left and right.

Therefore, regardless of the relative positions of the minima, there exists a k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Therefore, option (b) is true.

But wait, the answer options are (a), (b), (c), (d). Let&#x27;s check the options again:

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

From the analysis above:

- (a) is false because for any real k, f(x) = k has either two, three, or four real roots. There is no k where it has exactly one real root.

- (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima (or between the higher local minimum and the local maximum, but actually in our case, between m₁ and m₃, assuming m₁ &lt; m₃), the equation f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

Wait, earlier, when k is between m₁ and m₃, which are both minima, the horizontal line y = k intersects the graph three times: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots.

- (c) is false because when k is greater than M or less than m₁ (the lower of the two minima), f(x) = k has only two real roots.

- (d) is false because when k is between the two local minima or between a local minimum and the local maximum, f(x) = k has four or three real roots, respectively, so not always two real and two complex roots.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

But wait, the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, and the options are (a)-(d). The analysis above suggests that (b) is true. However, in the initial problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots. Wait, but in our analysis, we concluded that between the two local minima, we can get three real roots. But the key is that the quartic has three critical points: two minima and one maximum or two maxima and one minima, but in this case, with leading coefficient positive, it&#x27;s two minima and one maximum.

But let me verify with an example. Take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x + 1. Wait, maybe a simpler example. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 2x³ - 3x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 6x² - 6x. Let&#x27;s find the critical points.

Wait, maybe a better example is f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has three real roots: x = 0, x = sqrt(2), x = -sqrt(2). So the critical points are at x = -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). Then f(x) at these points: f(-sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(2))⁴ - 4*(sqrt(2))² = 4 - 8 = -4. f(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. f(sqrt(2)) = same as f(-sqrt(2)) = -4. So the local minima are at x = ±sqrt(2) with f(x) = -4, and the local maximum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0. So this is a symmetric quartic. Then, for k between -4 and 0, f(x) = k has four real roots. For k = 0, it has three real roots (double root at x = 0 and two at ±sqrt(something)). For k &lt; -4, two real roots. For k &gt; 0, two real roots. For k between the minima and the maximum (i.e., between -4 and 0), four real roots. For k exactly at -4, three real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). Wait, but in this case, the two minima are equal. So here, m₁ = m₃ = -4. Therefore, there is no interval between m₁ and m₃; they are the same. Therefore, in this symmetric case, when k is between -4 and 0, you get four real roots, but when k is exactly -4, you get two real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). However, the original problem states that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does: -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). So in this case, the two minima are equal. Therefore, if the two local minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are equal), so the three real roots case doesn&#x27;t occur. Wait, but the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; for f’(x). In this example, f’(x) has three distinct real roots. But in this case, the minima are equal, so between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, you get four real roots. But if the minima are not equal, then between them, you would have three real roots.

Therefore, the key is whether the two local minima can be at different heights. If f’(x) has three distinct real roots, but the function f(x) could still have two equal minima. Wait, but in the example above, even with symmetric critical points, the minima are equal. So perhaps, depending on the coefficients, the minima can be equal or not. Therefore, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether the minima are equal or not, only that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Therefore, in some cases, you might have equal minima, in others not. Therefore, the answer would depend on whether, regardless of the specific f(x) meeting the condition, statement (b) is always true.

But wait, in the example where minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are the same), so the three real roots case would not exist. However, in that case, when k is between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, which is the same as saying between m and M, you get four real roots. When k is less than m or greater than M, you get two real roots. When k equals m, you get two double roots. When k equals M, you get three real roots (a double root and two simple roots). Therefore, in the symmetric case, statement (b) is false because there is no k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. When k = M, you have three real roots but one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. When k is between m and M, you have four distinct real roots. When k is less than m, two distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric case, statement (b) is false. But the problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does, but the minima are equal. Therefore, the correct answer would not always be (b). Therefore, my previous analysis was incorrect.

Therefore, there&#x27;s a problem: if the quartic is symmetric, with two equal minima, then there is no k for which f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) would not hold in such cases. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot; given that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Since there exist such polynomials where statement (b) is false, but there also exist polynomials where statement (b) is true. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the statement must hold for all such polynomials or if there exists at least one. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, implying that the statement must be always true given the conditions.

Therefore, since there exists a polynomial where f’(x) has three distinct real roots but there&#x27;s no k with three distinct real roots (like the symmetric quartic example), statement (b) is not always true. Therefore, my previous conclusion was wrong.

Then, what is the correct answer? Let&#x27;s re-examine the options.

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

In the symmetric example, the only possible numbers of real roots are two (k &lt; m), four (m &lt; k &lt; M), three (k = m or k = M), or two (k &gt; M). So in this case, there is no k with exactly one real root. Therefore, statement (a) is false.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric example, when k = m or k = M, we have three real roots but with a double root, so they are not distinct. Therefore, in this case, there is no k with three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) is false.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

False, since for k &gt; M or k &lt; m, there are only two real roots.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

False, since for some k, there are four real roots.

Therefore, in this case, none of the options are true? But that can&#x27;t be, because the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the symmetric example. Let&#x27;s take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has roots at x = 0, sqrt(2), -sqrt(2). So three distinct real roots. The function f(x) = x⁴ - 4x² has local maxima at x = 0 (f(0) = 0) and local minima at x = ±sqrt(2) (f(±sqrt(2)) = -4). Then, for k = -4, the equation f(x) = -4 has double roots at x = ±sqrt(2). For k = 0, it has a double root at x = 0 and simple roots at x = ±2. So, in this case, when k = 0, the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. Therefore, three real roots, but only two distinct ones (x = 0 and x = ±2). Wait, no. If x = ±2 are roots, then total roots are x = 0 (double), x = 2, and x = -2. So four roots total, but with x = 0 counted twice. However, the equation x⁴ - 4x² = 0 factors as x²(x² - 4) = 0, so roots at x = 0 (multiplicity 2), x = 2, x = -2. So in this case, for k = 0, there are three distinct real roots (0, 2, -2), with one of them being a double root. Therefore, in terms of distinct real roots, it&#x27;s three. So, statement (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would be true here because even though 0 is a double root, the roots are still distinct: -2, 0, 2. So in this case, k = 0 gives three distinct real roots, even with a double root at 0. Therefore, perhaps in this example, statement (b) is true.

Wait, but if we take k = -4, then f(x) = -4 has roots at x = ±sqrt(2), each with multiplicity two. So, two distinct real roots, each a double root. Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is not satisfied for k = -4, but for k = 0, we have three distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric example, there does exist a k (specifically k = 0) such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) is true.

But earlier, I thought that when the minima are equal, there&#x27;s no k between them, but in reality, even in the symmetric case, there is a k (the local maximum) where you have three distinct real roots. So regardless of whether the minima are equal or not, the local maximum will always provide a k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Let me check.

In the symmetric example, at k = 0 (the local maximum), the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double root) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) holds.

If we take another example where the minima are not equal. Let’s construct a quartic with two unequal minima. For example, f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x. Compute its derivative: f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x² + 4x + 4. I need to check if this derivative has three distinct real roots. Instead of computing, maybe take a known quartic. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 6x² + 4x. Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x + 4. Let&#x27;s check the roots of f’(x). Maybe this cubic has three real roots. Alternatively, use f(x) = x⁴ - 3x³ - 3x² + 4x + 1. Not sure. Alternatively, take f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4), but that would have four real roots, but its derivative would have three critical points. However, expanding this would be time-consuming.

Alternatively, take a quartic with two minima at different heights. Suppose f(x) has a local minimum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0, a local maximum at x = 1 with f(1) = 2, and another local minimum at x = 2 with f(2) = 1. Then, the function would go from +infty down to 0 at x = 0, up to 2 at x = 1, down to 1 at x = 2, and back up to +infty. In this case, m₁ = 0, M = 2, m₃ = 1. Then, for k between m₁ = 0 and m₃ = 1, the equation f(x) = k would have three distinct real roots: one left of 0, one between 0 and 1, and one between 1 and 2. For k between m₃ = 1 and M = 2, four distinct real roots. For k = 1, three real roots (double root at x = 2 and two others). For k = 0, three real roots (double root at x = 0 and one other). For k = 2, three real roots (double root at x = 1 and two others). For k &lt; 0, two real roots; for k &gt; 2, two real roots.

Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k between 0 and 1 (the two minima) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric case, even though the minima are equal, there&#x27;s still a k = M where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots (with a double root at the local maximum). Wait, no. In the symmetric case, k = M is the local maximum. For example, in f(x) = x⁴ - 4x², the local maximum is at x = 0 with k = 0. The equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, even in the symmetric case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k (specifically k = M) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Even though one of them is a double root, but the roots are still distinct in terms of their x-values. Wait, no. A double root at x = 0 means that x = 0 is a repeated root, but the distinct roots are x = -2, x = 0, x = 2. Therefore, three distinct real roots. The multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect the distinctness. Therefore, even if there is a multiple root, as long as there are three separate x-values, it&#x27;s three distinct real roots. Therefore, in both symmetric and asymmetric cases, statement (b) holds.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) with real coefficients, we know that its derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) has three distinct real roots. This implies that \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum (since the leading coefficient is positive, the polynomial tends to \( +\infty \) as \( x \to \pm\infty \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Critical Points and Graph Shape**:
   - The polynomial \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum.
   - The graph of \( f(x) \) will have a &quot;W&quot; shape with two local minima and one local maximum.

2. **Behavior of \( f(x) = k \)**:
   - For \( k \) values greater than the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local maximum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the local maximum and the higher local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has four real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to either local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local minimum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the two local minima, \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - For \( k \) values less than the lower local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.

3. **Evaluation of Statements**:
   - **(a)** False: There is no \( k \) such that \( f(x) = k \) has exactly one real root.
   - **(b)** True: There exists a \( k \) (between the two local minima) where \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - **(c)** False: \( f(x) = k \) does not always have four distinct real roots (e.g., for \( k \) outside the range between the local minima and maximum).
   - **(d)** False: \( f(x) = k \) can have four real roots for some \( k \), so it does not always have two real and two complex roots.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{B}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out which of the statements (a), (b), (c), or (d) is true given that the polynomial f(x) = x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d has a derivative f’(x) with three distinct real roots. Let me start by recalling some calculus and polynomial theory.

First, since f(x) is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, its derivative f’(x) is a cubic (degree 3) polynomial. The problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. That means the derivative has three distinct critical points where the slope of f(x) is zero. For a cubic polynomial to have three distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive, but I might not need to compute that here. The key takeaway is that the original function f(x) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum, or two local maxima and one local minimum. Since the derivative is a cubic with three real roots, it must alternate between increasing and decreasing appropriately.

Now, the graph of a quartic polynomial typically has a &quot;W&quot; shape or an &quot;M&quot; shape depending on the leading coefficient. Since the leading term here is x⁴, which has a positive coefficient, as x approaches positive or negative infinity, f(x) tends to positive infinity. Therefore, the graph will eventually rise on both ends. Given that the derivative has three real roots, there are three critical points. For a quartic with positive leading coefficient, the typical shape with three critical points would be two local minima and one local maximum in between. So, the graph would go up, then down, then up, then down, then up again? Wait, no. Wait, the derivative is cubic, so it can have three critical points. So the original function f(x) will have three turning points. Since it&#x27;s a quartic, it can have up to three turning points (since the derivative is cubic, which can have up to three roots). So with three critical points, the graph of f(x) will have two local minima and one local maximum, or two maxima and one minima. But given that the leading coefficient is positive, as x approaches ±∞, f(x) goes to +∞. Therefore, the rightmost and leftmost critical points must be minima. So the structure would be: starting from the left, the function decreases to a local maximum, then increases to a local minimum, then decreases again to a local maximum, and then increases to infinity? Wait, that doesn&#x27;t make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if the derivative has three real roots, then the original function f(x) has three critical points. Let me label them as x₁ &lt; x₂ &lt; x₃. Since the leading term is positive, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, and the same as x approaches -infty. So, the rightmost critical point x₃ must be a local minimum (since after that, the function increases to infinity), and the leftmost critical point x₁ must be a local maximum (since coming from -infty, the function is decreasing until x₁, then starts increasing). Wait, no, that seems contradictory. Let me check:

If x approaches -infty, f(x) tends to +infty, so as we move from left to right (from -infty to +infty), the function starts at +infty, then at some point x₁ (the leftmost critical point) it might turn. If x₁ is a local maximum, then after x₁, the function decreases. Then, at x₂, another critical point, which would have to be a local minimum, so after x₂, the function increases again. Then at x₃, another critical point, which would be a local maximum, and then after x₃, the function decreases. But wait, but after x₃, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, which is a contradiction because if x₃ is a local maximum, then after x₃, the function should decrease, but it actually needs to increase to +infty. Therefore, that can&#x27;t be. Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the leftmost critical point x₁ is a local minimum. Let&#x27;s see: starting from -infty, f(x) is going to +infty. Then at x₁, which is a local minimum, the function starts increasing. Then at x₂, a local maximum, so after x₂, the function decreases. Then at x₃, another local minimum, so after x₃, the function increases again towards +infty. That makes sense. So the critical points are arranged as local minimum at x₁, local maximum at x₂, local minimum at x₃. Therefore, the graph has two local minima and one local maximum.

So the function f(x) would start at +infty, decrease to a local minimum at x₁, then increase to a local maximum at x₂, then decrease to a local minimum at x₃, and then increase again to +infty. So, the graph would look like a &quot;W&quot; but with the middle peak being a local maximum and the two valleys being local minima. So, the function has two local minima and one local maximum.

Given that structure, let&#x27;s consider the possible number of real roots for f(x) = k. Depending on the value of k, the horizontal line y = k can intersect the graph of f(x) in different ways.

If k is greater than the value of the local maximum at x₂, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃, because the function only exceeds k on the far left and far right.

If k is exactly equal to the value of the local maximum at x₂, then f(x) = k would have three real roots: one at x₂ (with multiplicity two, since it&#x27;s a local maximum) and one on each side (left of x₁ and right of x₃). But wait, if the local maximum is exactly at k, then the graph touches the line y = k at x₂, so that&#x27;s a double root, and crosses the line on either side. So three real roots, but one of them is a double root.

If k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two local minima, then suppose the local minima at x₁ and x₃ have values m₁ and m₃. Let&#x27;s assume that one of the minima is lower than the other. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, both minima must be below the local maximum. However, depending on the specific coefficients, one minimum could be lower than the other. Let&#x27;s say, without loss of generality, that m₁ &lt; m₃ (the left local minimum is lower than the right local minimum). Then, if k is between m₃ and the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots: two on the left side (between -infty and x₁, and between x₁ and x₂), and two on the right side (between x₂ and x₃, and between x₃ and +infty). Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two minima, say between M and m₃ (assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), then when k is in (m₃, M), the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. But actually, when you have two minima and one maximum, the graph goes from +infty to m₁ (local min), rises to M (local max), then falls to m₃ (local min), then rises again to +infty. So if k is between m₁ and M, then depending on where k is relative to m₃, the number of roots changes.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch a rough graph mentally. Starting from the left (x approaching -infty), f(x) is at +infty, decreases to m₁ at x₁ (local min), then increases to M at x₂ (local max), then decreases to m₃ at x₃ (local min), then increases back to +infty.

So, if k is greater than M, then the equation f(x) = k has two real roots: one on the far left and one on the far right.

If k is equal to M, then it has three real roots: one at x₂ (a double root) and one on each side.

If k is between m₃ and M, then it has four real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, one between x₂ and x₃, and one right of x₃.

If k is equal to m₃, then it has three real roots: one at x₃ (double root) and one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂.

If k is between m₁ and m₃, then it has two real roots: one left of x₁ and one right of x₃, because the horizontal line y = k only intersects the graph on the leftmost and rightmost ascending parts. Wait, but between x₁ and x₃, the function reaches a maximum at x₂, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, then the line y = k would cross the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. Wait, but if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the minima, but since m₁ is lower than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ to M, so it must cross y = k once there. Similarly, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then since m₃ is higher than m₁, and k is between m₁ and m₃, then on the interval x₂ to x₃, the function decreases from M to m₃, crossing y = k once. Similarly, on the interval x₃ to +infty, the function increases from m₃ to +infty, so y = k would cross once there. Similarly, on the interval -infty to x₁, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, crossing y = k once. Therefore, actually, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots. If k is equal to m₁, then it&#x27;s a double root at x₁ and another root on the right. Similarly, if k is equal to m₃, it&#x27;s a double root at x₃ and another root on the left. If k is less than m₁, since m₁ is the lower of the two minima, then the line y = k would intersect the graph only twice: once left of x₁ and once right of x₃. Wait, no. If k is less than m₁, which is the minimum, then the graph only reaches down to m₁, so y = k would not intersect the graph at all? Wait, no. Wait, as x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches +infty, and at x₁, it&#x27;s a local minimum m₁. So if k &lt; m₁, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃? Wait, but if k is less than m₁, which is the minimum value on the left side, then on the left side, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, so it must cross y = k once. On the right side, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is higher than m₁) up to +infty, so if k is less than m₁, then since m₃ is greater than m₁, and k is less than m₁, then on the right side, the function starts at m₃ (which is greater than k) and increases to infinity, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, if k &lt; m₁, there is only one real root on the left side. Similarly, if k &gt; M, there are two real roots on the extremes. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to tabulate the different cases.

Let me denote:

- The leftmost local minimum at x = x₁ with f(x₁) = m₁.

- The local maximum at x = x₂ with f(x₂) = M.

- The rightmost local minimum at x = x₃ with f(x₃) = m₃.

Assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ (since x₁ &lt; x₃ and the function might have asymmetrical minima), though it could also be m₃ &lt; m₁. Wait, but since the function is going from m₁ up to M, then down to m₃, and then up again. The relative positions of m₁ and m₃ depend on the specific coefficients. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify, so I can&#x27;t assume which is lower. Therefore, perhaps I need to consider both possibilities. But maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter. Let&#x27;s suppose m₁ ≤ m₃ for definiteness. Then:

- If k &gt; M: two real roots (left and right).

- If k = M: three real roots (one double root at x₂ and two simple roots on the sides).

- If m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots (left, between x₁ and x₂, between x₂ and x₃, right).

- If k = m₃: three real roots (double root at x₃ and two others).

- If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: four real roots (similar to above? Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, but the function between x₁ and x₂ goes up to M, which is higher than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function crosses y = k once (since it goes from m₁ to M), between x₂ and x₃, it crosses once (since it goes from M to m₃), and on both ends, left of x₁ and right of x₃, the function is above k? Wait, no. Wait, the left end (x approaching -infty) is +infty, so coming from the left, the function starts at +infty, decreases to m₁ (which is less than k, since k &gt; m₁), so it must cross y = k once on the left side (before x₁). Then, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross there. Wait, but m₃ is greater than k, so after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so if m₃ &gt; k, then it never crosses y = k again. Therefore, in this case, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k has three real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, and one between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought.

Wait, perhaps I need to more carefully analyze:

Case 1: k &gt; M. Then, the horizontal line y = k cuts the graph at two points: one far left (before x₁) and one far right (after x₃).

Case 2: k = M. The line touches the local maximum at x₂ and cuts the graph on the left and right sides, resulting in three real roots (one double root at x₂).

Case 3: m₃ &lt; k &lt; M. The line y = k intersects the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃.

Wait, but if m₃ is the right local minimum, and k is greater than m₃ but less than M, then after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so since k &gt; m₃, there will be a crossing right of x₃. Similarly, left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is less than k (since k &gt; m₃ and m₃ &gt; m₁, so k &gt; m₁). Therefore, left of x₁, the function crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ (which is less than k) up to M (which is greater than k), so crosses once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is less than k), so crosses once. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to infinity, crossing once. Therefore, four crossings. So that&#x27;s four real roots.

Case 4: k = m₃. The line touches the local minimum at x₃, so it&#x27;s a double root there, and crosses the graph left of x₁ and between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so at k = m₃, it only touches at x₃. Therefore, the roots would be left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂ (since the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing k = m₃ if m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), but wait, m₃ is the value at x₃, which is a local minimum. If k = m₃, then between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so it reaches m₃ at x₃. Therefore, if k = m₃, then there&#x27;s a root at x₃ (double root) and another root left of x₁ (since the function decreases from +infty to m₁, which is less than m₃, so crosses y = m₃ once left of x₁) and another root between x₁ and x₂ (as the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing y = m₃ once). So total of three roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and a double root at x₃.

Case 5: m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃. Here, k is between the two local minima. Since m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum. Let&#x27;s assume m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph as follows:

- Left of x₁: the function comes down from +infty to m₁, which is less than k, so it crosses y = k once.

- Between x₁ and x₂: the function goes from m₁ (less than k) up to M (greater than k), so crosses once.

- Between x₂ and x₃: the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so crosses once.

- Right of x₃: the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = k there.

Therefore, total of three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃.

Wait, but hold on. If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃, then m₃ is greater than k, so right of x₃, the function starts at m₃ and goes up, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, only three real roots? But earlier, when k is between m₃ and M, we had four roots. Hmm.

Case 6: k = m₁. The line touches the left local minimum at x₁, resulting in a double root there. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than m₁), so if k = m₁, which is less than m₃, the function crosses y = k once between x₂ and x₃. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ to +infty, which is above k, so no crossing. Also, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M, so crosses y = k once. Wait, but if k = m₁, then between x₁ and x₂, the function starts at m₁ (k) and goes up, so the crossing is exactly at x₁, which is a double root. Then, another crossing between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, three real roots: double root at x₁ and single roots between x₂ and x₃ and right of x₃? Wait, no. Wait, if k = m₁, then at x₁, the function has a local minimum. So the graph touches y = k at x₁, and then goes up. On the left side, as x approaches -infty, the function approaches +infty, so it comes down from +infty to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, left of x₁, there&#x27;s no crossing since it&#x27;s decreasing to m₁. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root because it&#x27;s a local minimum). Then, moving from x₁ to x₂, the function increases to M, which is greater than m₁, so there&#x27;s no crossing there. Then, from x₂ to x₃, the function decreases to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Then, from x₃ to +infty, the function increases to +infty, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = m₁ again. Therefore, total of two real roots: a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but the original function at x approaching -infty is +infty, so when approaching from the left, the function decreases to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, for k = m₁, the leftmost intersection is exactly at x₁ (a double root), and then another intersection between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, two real roots (one double, one single). But in the context of the problem, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot; or &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, do they count multiplicity? The problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for option (a). If they count multiplicity, then at k = m₁, f(x) = k has two real roots (one double, one single). If they don&#x27;t count multiplicity, then maybe it&#x27;s considered as two real roots (but one is a double root). Wait, the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;. So if multiplicity is considered, then a double root would count as one root, but actually, in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s still one. Wait, no. Wait, multiplicity is about the number of roots counting multiplicity. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, which might mean exactly one distinct real root, or exactly one real root counting multiplicity. The question is ambiguous, but in standard terminology, &quot;exactly one real root&quot; usually refers to exactly one distinct real root, but in some contexts, it might count multiplicity. However, in options (b) and (c), they mention &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; and &quot;four distinct real roots&quot;, so it seems like they are distinguishing between distinct roots and multiple roots. Therefore, for (a), &quot;exactly one real root&quot; probably means exactly one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. Similarly, for (b), &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;. So in the case where k = m₁, we have a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃, so that&#x27;s two distinct real roots (x₁ with multiplicity two and another root). Therefore, (a) is not satisfied here.

Case 7: k &lt; m₁. Then, the horizontal line y = k is below both local minima. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, the line y = k would intersect the graph twice: once on the far left (before x₁) and once on the far right (after x₃). Therefore, two real roots.

So summarizing:

- k &gt; M: two real roots.

- k = M: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots.

- k = m₃: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: three real roots.

- k = m₁: three real roots (one double, two simple? Wait, earlier analysis said two roots, but maybe I messed up).

Wait, let me re-examine k = m₁. If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root) and since between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, total of two distinct real roots: x₁ (double) and one between x₂ and x₃. So, in terms of distinct roots, two; in terms of total roots counting multiplicity, three. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for (a). If &quot;exactly one&quot; means one distinct root, then even if it&#x27;s a double root, that would still be considered one real root. But in standard terminology, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, they usually mean one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. However, in the case of k = M, we have three real roots but one is a double root. The problem&#x27;s option (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, so distinctness is important there. So, for (a), if there exists a k where f(x) = k has exactly one real root (distinct or not?), the answer depends on that.

But in the case where k is less than m₁, we have two distinct real roots. If k is equal to m₁, we have two real roots (x₁ is a double root, and another one). If k is between m₁ and m₃, three real roots. If k is equal to m₃ or M, three real roots (with a double root). If k is between m₃ and M, four real roots. If k is greater than M, two real roots.

Wait, but in none of these cases do we have exactly one real root. Even when k is less than m₁, we have two real roots. When k equals m₁ or m₃ or M, we have two or three real roots but with multiplicities. So, there is no k for which f(x) = k has exactly one real root, right? Unless when the polynomial is tangent to the line y = k at one point and doesn&#x27;t cross it elsewhere, but given the shape of the quartic, which tends to +infty on both sides, if the horizontal line is tangent at the local maximum or one of the minima, it will still cross the graph on one side or the other. Wait, for example, if k is equal to the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = M has a double root at x₂ and two other roots on the left and right. Wait, no. Wait, at k = M, the horizontal line touches the local maximum at x₂. To the left of x₂, the function is increasing from m₁ to M, so it only reaches M at x₂. To the right of x₂, the function decreases from M to m₃ and then increases again. Therefore, the line y = M would intersect the graph only at x₂ (a double root) and on the right side as the function increases past M again? Wait, no. Wait, after x₃, the function increases from m₃ to +infty. If M is the local maximum, then m₃ is less than M. So, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is less than M) up to +infty, so it must cross y = M once after x₃. Similarly, to the left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁ (which is less than M), so it must cross y = M once before x₁. Therefore, when k = M, the equation f(x) = M has three real roots: one at x₂ (double root) and one on each side. Therefore, three distinct real roots? Wait, but x₂ is a double root, so in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s three: x₂, and one on each side. So multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect distinctness. Therefore, even though x₂ is a double root, it&#x27;s still one distinct root. So in that case, k = M gives three distinct real roots, with one of them being a double root. Wait, no. If a root is a double root, it&#x27;s still a single distinct root; the distinctness refers to the x-values. So x₂ is one distinct root, and the other two are also distinct. So in total, three distinct real roots, one with multiplicity two. Therefore, for the problem&#x27;s option (b): &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Well, when k = M or k = m₁ or k = m₃, you have three real roots, but with one double root. But the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would require all three roots to be distinct, i.e., no multiple roots. So in that case, even though at k = M you have three real roots, one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. Therefore, the answer would be that statement (b) is false. Wait, but when k is between m₃ and M, we have four distinct real roots. When k is between m₁ and m₃, three distinct real roots. When k is less than m₁ or greater than M, two distinct real roots. When k equals M, m₁, or m₃, three real roots with one double root.

Therefore, the statement (b) says: &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Given that when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three distinct real roots (as per the earlier analysis). Wait, earlier I thought when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three real roots. Wait, let&#x27;s recheck.

Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two local minima, then depending on the graph, how does the horizontal line intersect? Suppose m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum, with m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, k between m₁ and m₃ would be above m₁ and below m₃. Then, on the left side (x &lt; x₁), the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is below k, so it crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is above k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross. Therefore, three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots because they are in different intervals. Therefore, statement (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima, we get three distinct real roots. Additionally, if m₁ &gt; m₃, then similar logic applies, just switch left and right.

Therefore, regardless of the relative positions of the minima, there exists a k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Therefore, option (b) is true.

But wait, the answer options are (a), (b), (c), (d). Let&#x27;s check the options again:

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

From the analysis above:

- (a) is false because for any real k, f(x) = k has either two, three, or four real roots. There is no k where it has exactly one real root.

- (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima (or between the higher local minimum and the local maximum, but actually in our case, between m₁ and m₃, assuming m₁ &lt; m₃), the equation f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

Wait, earlier, when k is between m₁ and m₃, which are both minima, the horizontal line y = k intersects the graph three times: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots.

- (c) is false because when k is greater than M or less than m₁ (the lower of the two minima), f(x) = k has only two real roots.

- (d) is false because when k is between the two local minima or between a local minimum and the local maximum, f(x) = k has four or three real roots, respectively, so not always two real and two complex roots.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

But wait, the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, and the options are (a)-(d). The analysis above suggests that (b) is true. However, in the initial problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots. Wait, but in our analysis, we concluded that between the two local minima, we can get three real roots. But the key is that the quartic has three critical points: two minima and one maximum or two maxima and one minima, but in this case, with leading coefficient positive, it&#x27;s two minima and one maximum.

But let me verify with an example. Take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x + 1. Wait, maybe a simpler example. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 2x³ - 3x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 6x² - 6x. Let&#x27;s find the critical points.

Wait, maybe a better example is f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has three real roots: x = 0, x = sqrt(2), x = -sqrt(2). So the critical points are at x = -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). Then f(x) at these points: f(-sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(2))⁴ - 4*(sqrt(2))² = 4 - 8 = -4. f(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. f(sqrt(2)) = same as f(-sqrt(2)) = -4. So the local minima are at x = ±sqrt(2) with f(x) = -4, and the local maximum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0. So this is a symmetric quartic. Then, for k between -4 and 0, f(x) = k has four real roots. For k = 0, it has three real roots (double root at x = 0 and two at ±sqrt(something)). For k &lt; -4, two real roots. For k &gt; 0, two real roots. For k between the minima and the maximum (i.e., between -4 and 0), four real roots. For k exactly at -4, three real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). Wait, but in this case, the two minima are equal. So here, m₁ = m₃ = -4. Therefore, there is no interval between m₁ and m₃; they are the same. Therefore, in this symmetric case, when k is between -4 and 0, you get four real roots, but when k is exactly -4, you get two real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). However, the original problem states that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does: -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). So in this case, the two minima are equal. Therefore, if the two local minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are equal), so the three real roots case doesn&#x27;t occur. Wait, but the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; for f’(x). In this example, f’(x) has three distinct real roots. But in this case, the minima are equal, so between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, you get four real roots. But if the minima are not equal, then between them, you would have three real roots.

Therefore, the key is whether the two local minima can be at different heights. If f’(x) has three distinct real roots, but the function f(x) could still have two equal minima. Wait, but in the example above, even with symmetric critical points, the minima are equal. So perhaps, depending on the coefficients, the minima can be equal or not. Therefore, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether the minima are equal or not, only that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Therefore, in some cases, you might have equal minima, in others not. Therefore, the answer would depend on whether, regardless of the specific f(x) meeting the condition, statement (b) is always true.

But wait, in the example where minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are the same), so the three real roots case would not exist. However, in that case, when k is between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, which is the same as saying between m and M, you get four real roots. When k is less than m or greater than M, you get two real roots. When k equals m, you get two double roots. When k equals M, you get three real roots (a double root and two simple roots). Therefore, in the symmetric case, statement (b) is false because there is no k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. When k = M, you have three real roots but one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. When k is between m and M, you have four distinct real roots. When k is less than m, two distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric case, statement (b) is false. But the problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does, but the minima are equal. Therefore, the correct answer would not always be (b). Therefore, my previous analysis was incorrect.

Therefore, there&#x27;s a problem: if the quartic is symmetric, with two equal minima, then there is no k for which f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) would not hold in such cases. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot; given that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Since there exist such polynomials where statement (b) is false, but there also exist polynomials where statement (b) is true. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the statement must hold for all such polynomials or if there exists at least one. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, implying that the statement must be always true given the conditions.

Therefore, since there exists a polynomial where f’(x) has three distinct real roots but there&#x27;s no k with three distinct real roots (like the symmetric quartic example), statement (b) is not always true. Therefore, my previous conclusion was wrong.

Then, what is the correct answer? Let&#x27;s re-examine the options.

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

In the symmetric example, the only possible numbers of real roots are two (k &lt; m), four (m &lt; k &lt; M), three (k = m or k = M), or two (k &gt; M). So in this case, there is no k with exactly one real root. Therefore, statement (a) is false.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric example, when k = m or k = M, we have three real roots but with a double root, so they are not distinct. Therefore, in this case, there is no k with three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) is false.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

False, since for k &gt; M or k &lt; m, there are only two real roots.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

False, since for some k, there are four real roots.

Therefore, in this case, none of the options are true? But that can&#x27;t be, because the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the symmetric example. Let&#x27;s take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has roots at x = 0, sqrt(2), -sqrt(2). So three distinct real roots. The function f(x) = x⁴ - 4x² has local maxima at x = 0 (f(0) = 0) and local minima at x = ±sqrt(2) (f(±sqrt(2)) = -4). Then, for k = -4, the equation f(x) = -4 has double roots at x = ±sqrt(2). For k = 0, it has a double root at x = 0 and simple roots at x = ±2. So, in this case, when k = 0, the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. Therefore, three real roots, but only two distinct ones (x = 0 and x = ±2). Wait, no. If x = ±2 are roots, then total roots are x = 0 (double), x = 2, and x = -2. So four roots total, but with x = 0 counted twice. However, the equation x⁴ - 4x² = 0 factors as x²(x² - 4) = 0, so roots at x = 0 (multiplicity 2), x = 2, x = -2. So in this case, for k = 0, there are three distinct real roots (0, 2, -2), with one of them being a double root. Therefore, in terms of distinct real roots, it&#x27;s three. So, statement (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would be true here because even though 0 is a double root, the roots are still distinct: -2, 0, 2. So in this case, k = 0 gives three distinct real roots, even with a double root at 0. Therefore, perhaps in this example, statement (b) is true.

Wait, but if we take k = -4, then f(x) = -4 has roots at x = ±sqrt(2), each with multiplicity two. So, two distinct real roots, each a double root. Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is not satisfied for k = -4, but for k = 0, we have three distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric example, there does exist a k (specifically k = 0) such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) is true.

But earlier, I thought that when the minima are equal, there&#x27;s no k between them, but in reality, even in the symmetric case, there is a k (the local maximum) where you have three distinct real roots. So regardless of whether the minima are equal or not, the local maximum will always provide a k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Let me check.

In the symmetric example, at k = 0 (the local maximum), the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double root) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) holds.

If we take another example where the minima are not equal. Let’s construct a quartic with two unequal minima. For example, f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x. Compute its derivative: f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x² + 4x + 4. I need to check if this derivative has three distinct real roots. Instead of computing, maybe take a known quartic. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 6x² + 4x. Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x + 4. Let&#x27;s check the roots of f’(x). Maybe this cubic has three real roots. Alternatively, use f(x) = x⁴ - 3x³ - 3x² + 4x + 1. Not sure. Alternatively, take f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4), but that would have four real roots, but its derivative would have three critical points. However, expanding this would be time-consuming.

Alternatively, take a quartic with two minima at different heights. Suppose f(x) has a local minimum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0, a local maximum at x = 1 with f(1) = 2, and another local minimum at x = 2 with f(2) = 1. Then, the function would go from +infty down to 0 at x = 0, up to 2 at x = 1, down to 1 at x = 2, and back up to +infty. In this case, m₁ = 0, M = 2, m₃ = 1. Then, for k between m₁ = 0 and m₃ = 1, the equation f(x) = k would have three distinct real roots: one left of 0, one between 0 and 1, and one between 1 and 2. For k between m₃ = 1 and M = 2, four distinct real roots. For k = 1, three real roots (double root at x = 2 and two others). For k = 0, three real roots (double root at x = 0 and one other). For k = 2, three real roots (double root at x = 1 and two others). For k &lt; 0, two real roots; for k &gt; 2, two real roots.

Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k between 0 and 1 (the two minima) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric case, even though the minima are equal, there&#x27;s still a k = M where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots (with a double root at the local maximum). Wait, no. In the symmetric case, k = M is the local maximum. For example, in f(x) = x⁴ - 4x², the local maximum is at x = 0 with k = 0. The equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, even in the symmetric case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k (specifically k = M) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Even though one of them is a double root, but the roots are still distinct in terms of their x-values. Wait, no. A double root at x = 0 means that x = 0 is a repeated root, but the distinct roots are x = -2, x = 0, x = 2. Therefore, three distinct real roots. The multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect the distinctness. Therefore, even if there is a multiple root, as long as there are three separate x-values, it&#x27;s three distinct real roots. Therefore, in both symmetric and asymmetric cases, statement (b) holds.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) with real coefficients, we know that its derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) has three distinct real roots. This implies that \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum (since the leading coefficient is positive, the polynomial tends to \( +\infty \) as \( x \to \pm\infty \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Critical Points and Graph Shape**:
   - The polynomial \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum.
   - The graph of \( f(x) \) will have a &quot;W&quot; shape with two local minima and one local maximum.

2. **Behavior of \( f(x) = k \)**:
   - For \( k \) values greater than the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local maximum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the local maximum and the higher local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has four real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to either local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local minimum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the two local minima, \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - For \( k \) values less than the lower local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.

3. **Evaluation of Statements**:
   - **(a)** False: There is no \( k \) such that \( f(x) = k \) has exactly one real root.
   - **(b)** True: There exists a \( k \) (between the two local minima) where \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - **(c)** False: \( f(x) = k \) does not always have four distinct real roots (e.g., for \( k \) outside the range between the local minima and maximum).
   - **(d)** False: \( f(x) = k \) can have four real roots for some \( k \), so it does not always have two real and two complex roots.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out which of the statements (a), (b), (c), or (d) is true given that the polynomial f(x) = x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d has a derivative f’(x) with three distinct real roots. Let me start by recalling some calculus and polynomial theory.

First, since f(x) is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, its derivative f’(x) is a cubic (degree 3) polynomial. The problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. That means the derivative has three distinct critical points where the slope of f(x) is zero. For a cubic polynomial to have three distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive, but I might not need to compute that here. The key takeaway is that the original function f(x) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum, or two local maxima and one local minimum. Since the derivative is a cubic with three real roots, it must alternate between increasing and decreasing appropriately.

Now, the graph of a quartic polynomial typically has a &quot;W&quot; shape or an &quot;M&quot; shape depending on the leading coefficient. Since the leading term here is x⁴, which has a positive coefficient, as x approaches positive or negative infinity, f(x) tends to positive infinity. Therefore, the graph will eventually rise on both ends. Given that the derivative has three real roots, there are three critical points. For a quartic with positive leading coefficient, the typical shape with three critical points would be two local minima and one local maximum in between. So, the graph would go up, then down, then up, then down, then up again? Wait, no. Wait, the derivative is cubic, so it can have three critical points. So the original function f(x) will have three turning points. Since it&#x27;s a quartic, it can have up to three turning points (since the derivative is cubic, which can have up to three roots). So with three critical points, the graph of f(x) will have two local minima and one local maximum, or two maxima and one minima. But given that the leading coefficient is positive, as x approaches ±∞, f(x) goes to +∞. Therefore, the rightmost and leftmost critical points must be minima. So the structure would be: starting from the left, the function decreases to a local maximum, then increases to a local minimum, then decreases again to a local maximum, and then increases to infinity? Wait, that doesn&#x27;t make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if the derivative has three real roots, then the original function f(x) has three critical points. Let me label them as x₁ &lt; x₂ &lt; x₃. Since the leading term is positive, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, and the same as x approaches -infty. So, the rightmost critical point x₃ must be a local minimum (since after that, the function increases to infinity), and the leftmost critical point x₁ must be a local maximum (since coming from -infty, the function is decreasing until x₁, then starts increasing). Wait, no, that seems contradictory. Let me check:

If x approaches -infty, f(x) tends to +infty, so as we move from left to right (from -infty to +infty), the function starts at +infty, then at some point x₁ (the leftmost critical point) it might turn. If x₁ is a local maximum, then after x₁, the function decreases. Then, at x₂, another critical point, which would have to be a local minimum, so after x₂, the function increases again. Then at x₃, another critical point, which would be a local maximum, and then after x₃, the function decreases. But wait, but after x₃, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, which is a contradiction because if x₃ is a local maximum, then after x₃, the function should decrease, but it actually needs to increase to +infty. Therefore, that can&#x27;t be. Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the leftmost critical point x₁ is a local minimum. Let&#x27;s see: starting from -infty, f(x) is going to +infty. Then at x₁, which is a local minimum, the function starts increasing. Then at x₂, a local maximum, so after x₂, the function decreases. Then at x₃, another local minimum, so after x₃, the function increases again towards +infty. That makes sense. So the critical points are arranged as local minimum at x₁, local maximum at x₂, local minimum at x₃. Therefore, the graph has two local minima and one local maximum.

So the function f(x) would start at +infty, decrease to a local minimum at x₁, then increase to a local maximum at x₂, then decrease to a local minimum at x₃, and then increase again to +infty. So, the graph would look like a &quot;W&quot; but with the middle peak being a local maximum and the two valleys being local minima. So, the function has two local minima and one local maximum.

Given that structure, let&#x27;s consider the possible number of real roots for f(x) = k. Depending on the value of k, the horizontal line y = k can intersect the graph of f(x) in different ways.

If k is greater than the value of the local maximum at x₂, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃, because the function only exceeds k on the far left and far right.

If k is exactly equal to the value of the local maximum at x₂, then f(x) = k would have three real roots: one at x₂ (with multiplicity two, since it&#x27;s a local maximum) and one on each side (left of x₁ and right of x₃). But wait, if the local maximum is exactly at k, then the graph touches the line y = k at x₂, so that&#x27;s a double root, and crosses the line on either side. So three real roots, but one of them is a double root.

If k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two local minima, then suppose the local minima at x₁ and x₃ have values m₁ and m₃. Let&#x27;s assume that one of the minima is lower than the other. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, both minima must be below the local maximum. However, depending on the specific coefficients, one minimum could be lower than the other. Let&#x27;s say, without loss of generality, that m₁ &lt; m₃ (the left local minimum is lower than the right local minimum). Then, if k is between m₃ and the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots: two on the left side (between -infty and x₁, and between x₁ and x₂), and two on the right side (between x₂ and x₃, and between x₃ and +infty). Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two minima, say between M and m₃ (assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), then when k is in (m₃, M), the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. But actually, when you have two minima and one maximum, the graph goes from +infty to m₁ (local min), rises to M (local max), then falls to m₃ (local min), then rises again to +infty. So if k is between m₁ and M, then depending on where k is relative to m₃, the number of roots changes.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch a rough graph mentally. Starting from the left (x approaching -infty), f(x) is at +infty, decreases to m₁ at x₁ (local min), then increases to M at x₂ (local max), then decreases to m₃ at x₃ (local min), then increases back to +infty.

So, if k is greater than M, then the equation f(x) = k has two real roots: one on the far left and one on the far right.

If k is equal to M, then it has three real roots: one at x₂ (a double root) and one on each side.

If k is between m₃ and M, then it has four real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, one between x₂ and x₃, and one right of x₃.

If k is equal to m₃, then it has three real roots: one at x₃ (double root) and one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂.

If k is between m₁ and m₃, then it has two real roots: one left of x₁ and one right of x₃, because the horizontal line y = k only intersects the graph on the leftmost and rightmost ascending parts. Wait, but between x₁ and x₃, the function reaches a maximum at x₂, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, then the line y = k would cross the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. Wait, but if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the minima, but since m₁ is lower than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ to M, so it must cross y = k once there. Similarly, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then since m₃ is higher than m₁, and k is between m₁ and m₃, then on the interval x₂ to x₃, the function decreases from M to m₃, crossing y = k once. Similarly, on the interval x₃ to +infty, the function increases from m₃ to +infty, so y = k would cross once there. Similarly, on the interval -infty to x₁, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, crossing y = k once. Therefore, actually, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots. If k is equal to m₁, then it&#x27;s a double root at x₁ and another root on the right. Similarly, if k is equal to m₃, it&#x27;s a double root at x₃ and another root on the left. If k is less than m₁, since m₁ is the lower of the two minima, then the line y = k would intersect the graph only twice: once left of x₁ and once right of x₃. Wait, no. If k is less than m₁, which is the minimum, then the graph only reaches down to m₁, so y = k would not intersect the graph at all? Wait, no. Wait, as x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches +infty, and at x₁, it&#x27;s a local minimum m₁. So if k &lt; m₁, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃? Wait, but if k is less than m₁, which is the minimum value on the left side, then on the left side, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, so it must cross y = k once. On the right side, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is higher than m₁) up to +infty, so if k is less than m₁, then since m₃ is greater than m₁, and k is less than m₁, then on the right side, the function starts at m₃ (which is greater than k) and increases to infinity, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, if k &lt; m₁, there is only one real root on the left side. Similarly, if k &gt; M, there are two real roots on the extremes. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to tabulate the different cases.

Let me denote:

- The leftmost local minimum at x = x₁ with f(x₁) = m₁.

- The local maximum at x = x₂ with f(x₂) = M.

- The rightmost local minimum at x = x₃ with f(x₃) = m₃.

Assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ (since x₁ &lt; x₃ and the function might have asymmetrical minima), though it could also be m₃ &lt; m₁. Wait, but since the function is going from m₁ up to M, then down to m₃, and then up again. The relative positions of m₁ and m₃ depend on the specific coefficients. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify, so I can&#x27;t assume which is lower. Therefore, perhaps I need to consider both possibilities. But maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter. Let&#x27;s suppose m₁ ≤ m₃ for definiteness. Then:

- If k &gt; M: two real roots (left and right).

- If k = M: three real roots (one double root at x₂ and two simple roots on the sides).

- If m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots (left, between x₁ and x₂, between x₂ and x₃, right).

- If k = m₃: three real roots (double root at x₃ and two others).

- If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: four real roots (similar to above? Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, but the function between x₁ and x₂ goes up to M, which is higher than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function crosses y = k once (since it goes from m₁ to M), between x₂ and x₃, it crosses once (since it goes from M to m₃), and on both ends, left of x₁ and right of x₃, the function is above k? Wait, no. Wait, the left end (x approaching -infty) is +infty, so coming from the left, the function starts at +infty, decreases to m₁ (which is less than k, since k &gt; m₁), so it must cross y = k once on the left side (before x₁). Then, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross there. Wait, but m₃ is greater than k, so after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so if m₃ &gt; k, then it never crosses y = k again. Therefore, in this case, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k has three real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, and one between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought.

Wait, perhaps I need to more carefully analyze:

Case 1: k &gt; M. Then, the horizontal line y = k cuts the graph at two points: one far left (before x₁) and one far right (after x₃).

Case 2: k = M. The line touches the local maximum at x₂ and cuts the graph on the left and right sides, resulting in three real roots (one double root at x₂).

Case 3: m₃ &lt; k &lt; M. The line y = k intersects the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃.

Wait, but if m₃ is the right local minimum, and k is greater than m₃ but less than M, then after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so since k &gt; m₃, there will be a crossing right of x₃. Similarly, left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is less than k (since k &gt; m₃ and m₃ &gt; m₁, so k &gt; m₁). Therefore, left of x₁, the function crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ (which is less than k) up to M (which is greater than k), so crosses once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is less than k), so crosses once. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to infinity, crossing once. Therefore, four crossings. So that&#x27;s four real roots.

Case 4: k = m₃. The line touches the local minimum at x₃, so it&#x27;s a double root there, and crosses the graph left of x₁ and between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so at k = m₃, it only touches at x₃. Therefore, the roots would be left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂ (since the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing k = m₃ if m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), but wait, m₃ is the value at x₃, which is a local minimum. If k = m₃, then between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so it reaches m₃ at x₃. Therefore, if k = m₃, then there&#x27;s a root at x₃ (double root) and another root left of x₁ (since the function decreases from +infty to m₁, which is less than m₃, so crosses y = m₃ once left of x₁) and another root between x₁ and x₂ (as the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing y = m₃ once). So total of three roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and a double root at x₃.

Case 5: m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃. Here, k is between the two local minima. Since m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum. Let&#x27;s assume m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph as follows:

- Left of x₁: the function comes down from +infty to m₁, which is less than k, so it crosses y = k once.

- Between x₁ and x₂: the function goes from m₁ (less than k) up to M (greater than k), so crosses once.

- Between x₂ and x₃: the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so crosses once.

- Right of x₃: the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = k there.

Therefore, total of three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃.

Wait, but hold on. If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃, then m₃ is greater than k, so right of x₃, the function starts at m₃ and goes up, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, only three real roots? But earlier, when k is between m₃ and M, we had four roots. Hmm.

Case 6: k = m₁. The line touches the left local minimum at x₁, resulting in a double root there. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than m₁), so if k = m₁, which is less than m₃, the function crosses y = k once between x₂ and x₃. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ to +infty, which is above k, so no crossing. Also, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M, so crosses y = k once. Wait, but if k = m₁, then between x₁ and x₂, the function starts at m₁ (k) and goes up, so the crossing is exactly at x₁, which is a double root. Then, another crossing between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, three real roots: double root at x₁ and single roots between x₂ and x₃ and right of x₃? Wait, no. Wait, if k = m₁, then at x₁, the function has a local minimum. So the graph touches y = k at x₁, and then goes up. On the left side, as x approaches -infty, the function approaches +infty, so it comes down from +infty to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, left of x₁, there&#x27;s no crossing since it&#x27;s decreasing to m₁. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root because it&#x27;s a local minimum). Then, moving from x₁ to x₂, the function increases to M, which is greater than m₁, so there&#x27;s no crossing there. Then, from x₂ to x₃, the function decreases to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Then, from x₃ to +infty, the function increases to +infty, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = m₁ again. Therefore, total of two real roots: a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but the original function at x approaching -infty is +infty, so when approaching from the left, the function decreases to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, for k = m₁, the leftmost intersection is exactly at x₁ (a double root), and then another intersection between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, two real roots (one double, one single). But in the context of the problem, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot; or &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, do they count multiplicity? The problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for option (a). If they count multiplicity, then at k = m₁, f(x) = k has two real roots (one double, one single). If they don&#x27;t count multiplicity, then maybe it&#x27;s considered as two real roots (but one is a double root). Wait, the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;. So if multiplicity is considered, then a double root would count as one root, but actually, in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s still one. Wait, no. Wait, multiplicity is about the number of roots counting multiplicity. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, which might mean exactly one distinct real root, or exactly one real root counting multiplicity. The question is ambiguous, but in standard terminology, &quot;exactly one real root&quot; usually refers to exactly one distinct real root, but in some contexts, it might count multiplicity. However, in options (b) and (c), they mention &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; and &quot;four distinct real roots&quot;, so it seems like they are distinguishing between distinct roots and multiple roots. Therefore, for (a), &quot;exactly one real root&quot; probably means exactly one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. Similarly, for (b), &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;. So in the case where k = m₁, we have a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃, so that&#x27;s two distinct real roots (x₁ with multiplicity two and another root). Therefore, (a) is not satisfied here.

Case 7: k &lt; m₁. Then, the horizontal line y = k is below both local minima. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, the line y = k would intersect the graph twice: once on the far left (before x₁) and once on the far right (after x₃). Therefore, two real roots.

So summarizing:

- k &gt; M: two real roots.

- k = M: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots.

- k = m₃: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: three real roots.

- k = m₁: three real roots (one double, two simple? Wait, earlier analysis said two roots, but maybe I messed up).

Wait, let me re-examine k = m₁. If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root) and since between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, total of two distinct real roots: x₁ (double) and one between x₂ and x₃. So, in terms of distinct roots, two; in terms of total roots counting multiplicity, three. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for (a). If &quot;exactly one&quot; means one distinct root, then even if it&#x27;s a double root, that would still be considered one real root. But in standard terminology, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, they usually mean one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. However, in the case of k = M, we have three real roots but one is a double root. The problem&#x27;s option (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, so distinctness is important there. So, for (a), if there exists a k where f(x) = k has exactly one real root (distinct or not?), the answer depends on that.

But in the case where k is less than m₁, we have two distinct real roots. If k is equal to m₁, we have two real roots (x₁ is a double root, and another one). If k is between m₁ and m₃, three real roots. If k is equal to m₃ or M, three real roots (with a double root). If k is between m₃ and M, four real roots. If k is greater than M, two real roots.

Wait, but in none of these cases do we have exactly one real root. Even when k is less than m₁, we have two real roots. When k equals m₁ or m₃ or M, we have two or three real roots but with multiplicities. So, there is no k for which f(x) = k has exactly one real root, right? Unless when the polynomial is tangent to the line y = k at one point and doesn&#x27;t cross it elsewhere, but given the shape of the quartic, which tends to +infty on both sides, if the horizontal line is tangent at the local maximum or one of the minima, it will still cross the graph on one side or the other. Wait, for example, if k is equal to the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = M has a double root at x₂ and two other roots on the left and right. Wait, no. Wait, at k = M, the horizontal line touches the local maximum at x₂. To the left of x₂, the function is increasing from m₁ to M, so it only reaches M at x₂. To the right of x₂, the function decreases from M to m₃ and then increases again. Therefore, the line y = M would intersect the graph only at x₂ (a double root) and on the right side as the function increases past M again? Wait, no. Wait, after x₃, the function increases from m₃ to +infty. If M is the local maximum, then m₃ is less than M. So, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is less than M) up to +infty, so it must cross y = M once after x₃. Similarly, to the left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁ (which is less than M), so it must cross y = M once before x₁. Therefore, when k = M, the equation f(x) = M has three real roots: one at x₂ (double root) and one on each side. Therefore, three distinct real roots? Wait, but x₂ is a double root, so in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s three: x₂, and one on each side. So multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect distinctness. Therefore, even though x₂ is a double root, it&#x27;s still one distinct root. So in that case, k = M gives three distinct real roots, with one of them being a double root. Wait, no. If a root is a double root, it&#x27;s still a single distinct root; the distinctness refers to the x-values. So x₂ is one distinct root, and the other two are also distinct. So in total, three distinct real roots, one with multiplicity two. Therefore, for the problem&#x27;s option (b): &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Well, when k = M or k = m₁ or k = m₃, you have three real roots, but with one double root. But the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would require all three roots to be distinct, i.e., no multiple roots. So in that case, even though at k = M you have three real roots, one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. Therefore, the answer would be that statement (b) is false. Wait, but when k is between m₃ and M, we have four distinct real roots. When k is between m₁ and m₃, three distinct real roots. When k is less than m₁ or greater than M, two distinct real roots. When k equals M, m₁, or m₃, three real roots with one double root.

Therefore, the statement (b) says: &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Given that when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three distinct real roots (as per the earlier analysis). Wait, earlier I thought when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three real roots. Wait, let&#x27;s recheck.

Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two local minima, then depending on the graph, how does the horizontal line intersect? Suppose m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum, with m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, k between m₁ and m₃ would be above m₁ and below m₃. Then, on the left side (x &lt; x₁), the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is below k, so it crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is above k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross. Therefore, three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots because they are in different intervals. Therefore, statement (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima, we get three distinct real roots. Additionally, if m₁ &gt; m₃, then similar logic applies, just switch left and right.

Therefore, regardless of the relative positions of the minima, there exists a k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Therefore, option (b) is true.

But wait, the answer options are (a), (b), (c), (d). Let&#x27;s check the options again:

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

From the analysis above:

- (a) is false because for any real k, f(x) = k has either two, three, or four real roots. There is no k where it has exactly one real root.

- (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima (or between the higher local minimum and the local maximum, but actually in our case, between m₁ and m₃, assuming m₁ &lt; m₃), the equation f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

Wait, earlier, when k is between m₁ and m₃, which are both minima, the horizontal line y = k intersects the graph three times: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots.

- (c) is false because when k is greater than M or less than m₁ (the lower of the two minima), f(x) = k has only two real roots.

- (d) is false because when k is between the two local minima or between a local minimum and the local maximum, f(x) = k has four or three real roots, respectively, so not always two real and two complex roots.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

But wait, the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, and the options are (a)-(d). The analysis above suggests that (b) is true. However, in the initial problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots. Wait, but in our analysis, we concluded that between the two local minima, we can get three real roots. But the key is that the quartic has three critical points: two minima and one maximum or two maxima and one minima, but in this case, with leading coefficient positive, it&#x27;s two minima and one maximum.

But let me verify with an example. Take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x + 1. Wait, maybe a simpler example. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 2x³ - 3x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 6x² - 6x. Let&#x27;s find the critical points.

Wait, maybe a better example is f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has three real roots: x = 0, x = sqrt(2), x = -sqrt(2). So the critical points are at x = -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). Then f(x) at these points: f(-sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(2))⁴ - 4*(sqrt(2))² = 4 - 8 = -4. f(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. f(sqrt(2)) = same as f(-sqrt(2)) = -4. So the local minima are at x = ±sqrt(2) with f(x) = -4, and the local maximum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0. So this is a symmetric quartic. Then, for k between -4 and 0, f(x) = k has four real roots. For k = 0, it has three real roots (double root at x = 0 and two at ±sqrt(something)). For k &lt; -4, two real roots. For k &gt; 0, two real roots. For k between the minima and the maximum (i.e., between -4 and 0), four real roots. For k exactly at -4, three real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). Wait, but in this case, the two minima are equal. So here, m₁ = m₃ = -4. Therefore, there is no interval between m₁ and m₃; they are the same. Therefore, in this symmetric case, when k is between -4 and 0, you get four real roots, but when k is exactly -4, you get two real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). However, the original problem states that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does: -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). So in this case, the two minima are equal. Therefore, if the two local minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are equal), so the three real roots case doesn&#x27;t occur. Wait, but the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; for f’(x). In this example, f’(x) has three distinct real roots. But in this case, the minima are equal, so between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, you get four real roots. But if the minima are not equal, then between them, you would have three real roots.

Therefore, the key is whether the two local minima can be at different heights. If f’(x) has three distinct real roots, but the function f(x) could still have two equal minima. Wait, but in the example above, even with symmetric critical points, the minima are equal. So perhaps, depending on the coefficients, the minima can be equal or not. Therefore, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether the minima are equal or not, only that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Therefore, in some cases, you might have equal minima, in others not. Therefore, the answer would depend on whether, regardless of the specific f(x) meeting the condition, statement (b) is always true.

But wait, in the example where minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are the same), so the three real roots case would not exist. However, in that case, when k is between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, which is the same as saying between m and M, you get four real roots. When k is less than m or greater than M, you get two real roots. When k equals m, you get two double roots. When k equals M, you get three real roots (a double root and two simple roots). Therefore, in the symmetric case, statement (b) is false because there is no k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. When k = M, you have three real roots but one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. When k is between m and M, you have four distinct real roots. When k is less than m, two distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric case, statement (b) is false. But the problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does, but the minima are equal. Therefore, the correct answer would not always be (b). Therefore, my previous analysis was incorrect.

Therefore, there&#x27;s a problem: if the quartic is symmetric, with two equal minima, then there is no k for which f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) would not hold in such cases. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot; given that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Since there exist such polynomials where statement (b) is false, but there also exist polynomials where statement (b) is true. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the statement must hold for all such polynomials or if there exists at least one. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, implying that the statement must be always true given the conditions.

Therefore, since there exists a polynomial where f’(x) has three distinct real roots but there&#x27;s no k with three distinct real roots (like the symmetric quartic example), statement (b) is not always true. Therefore, my previous conclusion was wrong.

Then, what is the correct answer? Let&#x27;s re-examine the options.

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

In the symmetric example, the only possible numbers of real roots are two (k &lt; m), four (m &lt; k &lt; M), three (k = m or k = M), or two (k &gt; M). So in this case, there is no k with exactly one real root. Therefore, statement (a) is false.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric example, when k = m or k = M, we have three real roots but with a double root, so they are not distinct. Therefore, in this case, there is no k with three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) is false.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

False, since for k &gt; M or k &lt; m, there are only two real roots.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

False, since for some k, there are four real roots.

Therefore, in this case, none of the options are true? But that can&#x27;t be, because the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the symmetric example. Let&#x27;s take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has roots at x = 0, sqrt(2), -sqrt(2). So three distinct real roots. The function f(x) = x⁴ - 4x² has local maxima at x = 0 (f(0) = 0) and local minima at x = ±sqrt(2) (f(±sqrt(2)) = -4). Then, for k = -4, the equation f(x) = -4 has double roots at x = ±sqrt(2). For k = 0, it has a double root at x = 0 and simple roots at x = ±2. So, in this case, when k = 0, the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. Therefore, three real roots, but only two distinct ones (x = 0 and x = ±2). Wait, no. If x = ±2 are roots, then total roots are x = 0 (double), x = 2, and x = -2. So four roots total, but with x = 0 counted twice. However, the equation x⁴ - 4x² = 0 factors as x²(x² - 4) = 0, so roots at x = 0 (multiplicity 2), x = 2, x = -2. So in this case, for k = 0, there are three distinct real roots (0, 2, -2), with one of them being a double root. Therefore, in terms of distinct real roots, it&#x27;s three. So, statement (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would be true here because even though 0 is a double root, the roots are still distinct: -2, 0, 2. So in this case, k = 0 gives three distinct real roots, even with a double root at 0. Therefore, perhaps in this example, statement (b) is true.

Wait, but if we take k = -4, then f(x) = -4 has roots at x = ±sqrt(2), each with multiplicity two. So, two distinct real roots, each a double root. Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is not satisfied for k = -4, but for k = 0, we have three distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric example, there does exist a k (specifically k = 0) such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) is true.

But earlier, I thought that when the minima are equal, there&#x27;s no k between them, but in reality, even in the symmetric case, there is a k (the local maximum) where you have three distinct real roots. So regardless of whether the minima are equal or not, the local maximum will always provide a k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Let me check.

In the symmetric example, at k = 0 (the local maximum), the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double root) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) holds.

If we take another example where the minima are not equal. Let’s construct a quartic with two unequal minima. For example, f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x. Compute its derivative: f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x² + 4x + 4. I need to check if this derivative has three distinct real roots. Instead of computing, maybe take a known quartic. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 6x² + 4x. Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x + 4. Let&#x27;s check the roots of f’(x). Maybe this cubic has three real roots. Alternatively, use f(x) = x⁴ - 3x³ - 3x² + 4x + 1. Not sure. Alternatively, take f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4), but that would have four real roots, but its derivative would have three critical points. However, expanding this would be time-consuming.

Alternatively, take a quartic with two minima at different heights. Suppose f(x) has a local minimum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0, a local maximum at x = 1 with f(1) = 2, and another local minimum at x = 2 with f(2) = 1. Then, the function would go from +infty down to 0 at x = 0, up to 2 at x = 1, down to 1 at x = 2, and back up to +infty. In this case, m₁ = 0, M = 2, m₃ = 1. Then, for k between m₁ = 0 and m₃ = 1, the equation f(x) = k would have three distinct real roots: one left of 0, one between 0 and 1, and one between 1 and 2. For k between m₃ = 1 and M = 2, four distinct real roots. For k = 1, three real roots (double root at x = 2 and two others). For k = 0, three real roots (double root at x = 0 and one other). For k = 2, three real roots (double root at x = 1 and two others). For k &lt; 0, two real roots; for k &gt; 2, two real roots.

Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k between 0 and 1 (the two minima) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric case, even though the minima are equal, there&#x27;s still a k = M where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots (with a double root at the local maximum). Wait, no. In the symmetric case, k = M is the local maximum. For example, in f(x) = x⁴ - 4x², the local maximum is at x = 0 with k = 0. The equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, even in the symmetric case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k (specifically k = M) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Even though one of them is a double root, but the roots are still distinct in terms of their x-values. Wait, no. A double root at x = 0 means that x = 0 is a repeated root, but the distinct roots are x = -2, x = 0, x = 2. Therefore, three distinct real roots. The multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect the distinctness. Therefore, even if there is a multiple root, as long as there are three separate x-values, it&#x27;s three distinct real roots. Therefore, in both symmetric and asymmetric cases, statement (b) holds.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) with real coefficients, we know that its derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) has three distinct real roots. This implies that \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum (since the leading coefficient is positive, the polynomial tends to \( +\infty \) as \( x \to \pm\infty \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Critical Points and Graph Shape**:
   - The polynomial \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum.
   - The graph of \( f(x) \) will have a &quot;W&quot; shape with two local minima and one local maximum.

2. **Behavior of \( f(x) = k \)**:
   - For \( k \) values greater than the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local maximum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the local maximum and the higher local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has four real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to either local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local minimum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the two local minima, \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - For \( k \) values less than the lower local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.

3. **Evaluation of Statements**:
   - **(a)** False: There is no \( k \) such that \( f(x) = k \) has exactly one real root.
   - **(b)** True: There exists a \( k \) (between the two local minima) where \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - **(c)** False: \( f(x) = k \) does not always have four distinct real roots (e.g., for \( k \) outside the range between the local minima and maximum).
   - **(d)** False: \( f(x) = k \) can have four real roots for some \( k \), so it does not always have two real and two complex roots.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out which of the statements (a), (b), (c), or (d) is true given that the polynomial f(x) = x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d has a derivative f’(x) with three distinct real roots. Let me start by recalling some calculus and polynomial theory.

First, since f(x) is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, its derivative f’(x) is a cubic (degree 3) polynomial. The problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. That means the derivative has three distinct critical points where the slope of f(x) is zero. For a cubic polynomial to have three distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive, but I might not need to compute that here. The key takeaway is that the original function f(x) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum, or two local maxima and one local minimum. Since the derivative is a cubic with three real roots, it must alternate between increasing and decreasing appropriately.

Now, the graph of a quartic polynomial typically has a &quot;W&quot; shape or an &quot;M&quot; shape depending on the leading coefficient. Since the leading term here is x⁴, which has a positive coefficient, as x approaches positive or negative infinity, f(x) tends to positive infinity. Therefore, the graph will eventually rise on both ends. Given that the derivative has three real roots, there are three critical points. For a quartic with positive leading coefficient, the typical shape with three critical points would be two local minima and one local maximum in between. So, the graph would go up, then down, then up, then down, then up again? Wait, no. Wait, the derivative is cubic, so it can have three critical points. So the original function f(x) will have three turning points. Since it&#x27;s a quartic, it can have up to three turning points (since the derivative is cubic, which can have up to three roots). So with three critical points, the graph of f(x) will have two local minima and one local maximum, or two maxima and one minima. But given that the leading coefficient is positive, as x approaches ±∞, f(x) goes to +∞. Therefore, the rightmost and leftmost critical points must be minima. So the structure would be: starting from the left, the function decreases to a local maximum, then increases to a local minimum, then decreases again to a local maximum, and then increases to infinity? Wait, that doesn&#x27;t make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if the derivative has three real roots, then the original function f(x) has three critical points. Let me label them as x₁ &lt; x₂ &lt; x₃. Since the leading term is positive, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, and the same as x approaches -infty. So, the rightmost critical point x₃ must be a local minimum (since after that, the function increases to infinity), and the leftmost critical point x₁ must be a local maximum (since coming from -infty, the function is decreasing until x₁, then starts increasing). Wait, no, that seems contradictory. Let me check:

If x approaches -infty, f(x) tends to +infty, so as we move from left to right (from -infty to +infty), the function starts at +infty, then at some point x₁ (the leftmost critical point) it might turn. If x₁ is a local maximum, then after x₁, the function decreases. Then, at x₂, another critical point, which would have to be a local minimum, so after x₂, the function increases again. Then at x₃, another critical point, which would be a local maximum, and then after x₃, the function decreases. But wait, but after x₃, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, which is a contradiction because if x₃ is a local maximum, then after x₃, the function should decrease, but it actually needs to increase to +infty. Therefore, that can&#x27;t be. Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the leftmost critical point x₁ is a local minimum. Let&#x27;s see: starting from -infty, f(x) is going to +infty. Then at x₁, which is a local minimum, the function starts increasing. Then at x₂, a local maximum, so after x₂, the function decreases. Then at x₃, another local minimum, so after x₃, the function increases again towards +infty. That makes sense. So the critical points are arranged as local minimum at x₁, local maximum at x₂, local minimum at x₃. Therefore, the graph has two local minima and one local maximum.

So the function f(x) would start at +infty, decrease to a local minimum at x₁, then increase to a local maximum at x₂, then decrease to a local minimum at x₃, and then increase again to +infty. So, the graph would look like a &quot;W&quot; but with the middle peak being a local maximum and the two valleys being local minima. So, the function has two local minima and one local maximum.

Given that structure, let&#x27;s consider the possible number of real roots for f(x) = k. Depending on the value of k, the horizontal line y = k can intersect the graph of f(x) in different ways.

If k is greater than the value of the local maximum at x₂, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃, because the function only exceeds k on the far left and far right.

If k is exactly equal to the value of the local maximum at x₂, then f(x) = k would have three real roots: one at x₂ (with multiplicity two, since it&#x27;s a local maximum) and one on each side (left of x₁ and right of x₃). But wait, if the local maximum is exactly at k, then the graph touches the line y = k at x₂, so that&#x27;s a double root, and crosses the line on either side. So three real roots, but one of them is a double root.

If k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two local minima, then suppose the local minima at x₁ and x₃ have values m₁ and m₃. Let&#x27;s assume that one of the minima is lower than the other. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, both minima must be below the local maximum. However, depending on the specific coefficients, one minimum could be lower than the other. Let&#x27;s say, without loss of generality, that m₁ &lt; m₃ (the left local minimum is lower than the right local minimum). Then, if k is between m₃ and the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots: two on the left side (between -infty and x₁, and between x₁ and x₂), and two on the right side (between x₂ and x₃, and between x₃ and +infty). Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two minima, say between M and m₃ (assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), then when k is in (m₃, M), the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. But actually, when you have two minima and one maximum, the graph goes from +infty to m₁ (local min), rises to M (local max), then falls to m₃ (local min), then rises again to +infty. So if k is between m₁ and M, then depending on where k is relative to m₃, the number of roots changes.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch a rough graph mentally. Starting from the left (x approaching -infty), f(x) is at +infty, decreases to m₁ at x₁ (local min), then increases to M at x₂ (local max), then decreases to m₃ at x₃ (local min), then increases back to +infty.

So, if k is greater than M, then the equation f(x) = k has two real roots: one on the far left and one on the far right.

If k is equal to M, then it has three real roots: one at x₂ (a double root) and one on each side.

If k is between m₃ and M, then it has four real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, one between x₂ and x₃, and one right of x₃.

If k is equal to m₃, then it has three real roots: one at x₃ (double root) and one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂.

If k is between m₁ and m₃, then it has two real roots: one left of x₁ and one right of x₃, because the horizontal line y = k only intersects the graph on the leftmost and rightmost ascending parts. Wait, but between x₁ and x₃, the function reaches a maximum at x₂, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, then the line y = k would cross the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. Wait, but if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the minima, but since m₁ is lower than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ to M, so it must cross y = k once there. Similarly, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then since m₃ is higher than m₁, and k is between m₁ and m₃, then on the interval x₂ to x₃, the function decreases from M to m₃, crossing y = k once. Similarly, on the interval x₃ to +infty, the function increases from m₃ to +infty, so y = k would cross once there. Similarly, on the interval -infty to x₁, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, crossing y = k once. Therefore, actually, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots. If k is equal to m₁, then it&#x27;s a double root at x₁ and another root on the right. Similarly, if k is equal to m₃, it&#x27;s a double root at x₃ and another root on the left. If k is less than m₁, since m₁ is the lower of the two minima, then the line y = k would intersect the graph only twice: once left of x₁ and once right of x₃. Wait, no. If k is less than m₁, which is the minimum, then the graph only reaches down to m₁, so y = k would not intersect the graph at all? Wait, no. Wait, as x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches +infty, and at x₁, it&#x27;s a local minimum m₁. So if k &lt; m₁, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃? Wait, but if k is less than m₁, which is the minimum value on the left side, then on the left side, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, so it must cross y = k once. On the right side, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is higher than m₁) up to +infty, so if k is less than m₁, then since m₃ is greater than m₁, and k is less than m₁, then on the right side, the function starts at m₃ (which is greater than k) and increases to infinity, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, if k &lt; m₁, there is only one real root on the left side. Similarly, if k &gt; M, there are two real roots on the extremes. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to tabulate the different cases.

Let me denote:

- The leftmost local minimum at x = x₁ with f(x₁) = m₁.

- The local maximum at x = x₂ with f(x₂) = M.

- The rightmost local minimum at x = x₃ with f(x₃) = m₃.

Assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ (since x₁ &lt; x₃ and the function might have asymmetrical minima), though it could also be m₃ &lt; m₁. Wait, but since the function is going from m₁ up to M, then down to m₃, and then up again. The relative positions of m₁ and m₃ depend on the specific coefficients. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify, so I can&#x27;t assume which is lower. Therefore, perhaps I need to consider both possibilities. But maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter. Let&#x27;s suppose m₁ ≤ m₃ for definiteness. Then:

- If k &gt; M: two real roots (left and right).

- If k = M: three real roots (one double root at x₂ and two simple roots on the sides).

- If m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots (left, between x₁ and x₂, between x₂ and x₃, right).

- If k = m₃: three real roots (double root at x₃ and two others).

- If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: four real roots (similar to above? Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, but the function between x₁ and x₂ goes up to M, which is higher than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function crosses y = k once (since it goes from m₁ to M), between x₂ and x₃, it crosses once (since it goes from M to m₃), and on both ends, left of x₁ and right of x₃, the function is above k? Wait, no. Wait, the left end (x approaching -infty) is +infty, so coming from the left, the function starts at +infty, decreases to m₁ (which is less than k, since k &gt; m₁), so it must cross y = k once on the left side (before x₁). Then, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross there. Wait, but m₃ is greater than k, so after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so if m₃ &gt; k, then it never crosses y = k again. Therefore, in this case, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k has three real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, and one between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought.

Wait, perhaps I need to more carefully analyze:

Case 1: k &gt; M. Then, the horizontal line y = k cuts the graph at two points: one far left (before x₁) and one far right (after x₃).

Case 2: k = M. The line touches the local maximum at x₂ and cuts the graph on the left and right sides, resulting in three real roots (one double root at x₂).

Case 3: m₃ &lt; k &lt; M. The line y = k intersects the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃.

Wait, but if m₃ is the right local minimum, and k is greater than m₃ but less than M, then after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so since k &gt; m₃, there will be a crossing right of x₃. Similarly, left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is less than k (since k &gt; m₃ and m₃ &gt; m₁, so k &gt; m₁). Therefore, left of x₁, the function crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ (which is less than k) up to M (which is greater than k), so crosses once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is less than k), so crosses once. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to infinity, crossing once. Therefore, four crossings. So that&#x27;s four real roots.

Case 4: k = m₃. The line touches the local minimum at x₃, so it&#x27;s a double root there, and crosses the graph left of x₁ and between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so at k = m₃, it only touches at x₃. Therefore, the roots would be left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂ (since the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing k = m₃ if m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), but wait, m₃ is the value at x₃, which is a local minimum. If k = m₃, then between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so it reaches m₃ at x₃. Therefore, if k = m₃, then there&#x27;s a root at x₃ (double root) and another root left of x₁ (since the function decreases from +infty to m₁, which is less than m₃, so crosses y = m₃ once left of x₁) and another root between x₁ and x₂ (as the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing y = m₃ once). So total of three roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and a double root at x₃.

Case 5: m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃. Here, k is between the two local minima. Since m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum. Let&#x27;s assume m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph as follows:

- Left of x₁: the function comes down from +infty to m₁, which is less than k, so it crosses y = k once.

- Between x₁ and x₂: the function goes from m₁ (less than k) up to M (greater than k), so crosses once.

- Between x₂ and x₃: the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so crosses once.

- Right of x₃: the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = k there.

Therefore, total of three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃.

Wait, but hold on. If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃, then m₃ is greater than k, so right of x₃, the function starts at m₃ and goes up, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, only three real roots? But earlier, when k is between m₃ and M, we had four roots. Hmm.

Case 6: k = m₁. The line touches the left local minimum at x₁, resulting in a double root there. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than m₁), so if k = m₁, which is less than m₃, the function crosses y = k once between x₂ and x₃. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ to +infty, which is above k, so no crossing. Also, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M, so crosses y = k once. Wait, but if k = m₁, then between x₁ and x₂, the function starts at m₁ (k) and goes up, so the crossing is exactly at x₁, which is a double root. Then, another crossing between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, three real roots: double root at x₁ and single roots between x₂ and x₃ and right of x₃? Wait, no. Wait, if k = m₁, then at x₁, the function has a local minimum. So the graph touches y = k at x₁, and then goes up. On the left side, as x approaches -infty, the function approaches +infty, so it comes down from +infty to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, left of x₁, there&#x27;s no crossing since it&#x27;s decreasing to m₁. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root because it&#x27;s a local minimum). Then, moving from x₁ to x₂, the function increases to M, which is greater than m₁, so there&#x27;s no crossing there. Then, from x₂ to x₃, the function decreases to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Then, from x₃ to +infty, the function increases to +infty, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = m₁ again. Therefore, total of two real roots: a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but the original function at x approaching -infty is +infty, so when approaching from the left, the function decreases to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, for k = m₁, the leftmost intersection is exactly at x₁ (a double root), and then another intersection between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, two real roots (one double, one single). But in the context of the problem, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot; or &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, do they count multiplicity? The problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for option (a). If they count multiplicity, then at k = m₁, f(x) = k has two real roots (one double, one single). If they don&#x27;t count multiplicity, then maybe it&#x27;s considered as two real roots (but one is a double root). Wait, the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;. So if multiplicity is considered, then a double root would count as one root, but actually, in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s still one. Wait, no. Wait, multiplicity is about the number of roots counting multiplicity. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, which might mean exactly one distinct real root, or exactly one real root counting multiplicity. The question is ambiguous, but in standard terminology, &quot;exactly one real root&quot; usually refers to exactly one distinct real root, but in some contexts, it might count multiplicity. However, in options (b) and (c), they mention &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; and &quot;four distinct real roots&quot;, so it seems like they are distinguishing between distinct roots and multiple roots. Therefore, for (a), &quot;exactly one real root&quot; probably means exactly one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. Similarly, for (b), &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;. So in the case where k = m₁, we have a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃, so that&#x27;s two distinct real roots (x₁ with multiplicity two and another root). Therefore, (a) is not satisfied here.

Case 7: k &lt; m₁. Then, the horizontal line y = k is below both local minima. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, the line y = k would intersect the graph twice: once on the far left (before x₁) and once on the far right (after x₃). Therefore, two real roots.

So summarizing:

- k &gt; M: two real roots.

- k = M: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots.

- k = m₃: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: three real roots.

- k = m₁: three real roots (one double, two simple? Wait, earlier analysis said two roots, but maybe I messed up).

Wait, let me re-examine k = m₁. If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root) and since between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, total of two distinct real roots: x₁ (double) and one between x₂ and x₃. So, in terms of distinct roots, two; in terms of total roots counting multiplicity, three. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for (a). If &quot;exactly one&quot; means one distinct root, then even if it&#x27;s a double root, that would still be considered one real root. But in standard terminology, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, they usually mean one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. However, in the case of k = M, we have three real roots but one is a double root. The problem&#x27;s option (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, so distinctness is important there. So, for (a), if there exists a k where f(x) = k has exactly one real root (distinct or not?), the answer depends on that.

But in the case where k is less than m₁, we have two distinct real roots. If k is equal to m₁, we have two real roots (x₁ is a double root, and another one). If k is between m₁ and m₃, three real roots. If k is equal to m₃ or M, three real roots (with a double root). If k is between m₃ and M, four real roots. If k is greater than M, two real roots.

Wait, but in none of these cases do we have exactly one real root. Even when k is less than m₁, we have two real roots. When k equals m₁ or m₃ or M, we have two or three real roots but with multiplicities. So, there is no k for which f(x) = k has exactly one real root, right? Unless when the polynomial is tangent to the line y = k at one point and doesn&#x27;t cross it elsewhere, but given the shape of the quartic, which tends to +infty on both sides, if the horizontal line is tangent at the local maximum or one of the minima, it will still cross the graph on one side or the other. Wait, for example, if k is equal to the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = M has a double root at x₂ and two other roots on the left and right. Wait, no. Wait, at k = M, the horizontal line touches the local maximum at x₂. To the left of x₂, the function is increasing from m₁ to M, so it only reaches M at x₂. To the right of x₂, the function decreases from M to m₃ and then increases again. Therefore, the line y = M would intersect the graph only at x₂ (a double root) and on the right side as the function increases past M again? Wait, no. Wait, after x₃, the function increases from m₃ to +infty. If M is the local maximum, then m₃ is less than M. So, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is less than M) up to +infty, so it must cross y = M once after x₃. Similarly, to the left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁ (which is less than M), so it must cross y = M once before x₁. Therefore, when k = M, the equation f(x) = M has three real roots: one at x₂ (double root) and one on each side. Therefore, three distinct real roots? Wait, but x₂ is a double root, so in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s three: x₂, and one on each side. So multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect distinctness. Therefore, even though x₂ is a double root, it&#x27;s still one distinct root. So in that case, k = M gives three distinct real roots, with one of them being a double root. Wait, no. If a root is a double root, it&#x27;s still a single distinct root; the distinctness refers to the x-values. So x₂ is one distinct root, and the other two are also distinct. So in total, three distinct real roots, one with multiplicity two. Therefore, for the problem&#x27;s option (b): &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Well, when k = M or k = m₁ or k = m₃, you have three real roots, but with one double root. But the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would require all three roots to be distinct, i.e., no multiple roots. So in that case, even though at k = M you have three real roots, one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. Therefore, the answer would be that statement (b) is false. Wait, but when k is between m₃ and M, we have four distinct real roots. When k is between m₁ and m₃, three distinct real roots. When k is less than m₁ or greater than M, two distinct real roots. When k equals M, m₁, or m₃, three real roots with one double root.

Therefore, the statement (b) says: &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Given that when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three distinct real roots (as per the earlier analysis). Wait, earlier I thought when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three real roots. Wait, let&#x27;s recheck.

Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two local minima, then depending on the graph, how does the horizontal line intersect? Suppose m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum, with m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, k between m₁ and m₃ would be above m₁ and below m₃. Then, on the left side (x &lt; x₁), the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is below k, so it crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is above k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross. Therefore, three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots because they are in different intervals. Therefore, statement (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima, we get three distinct real roots. Additionally, if m₁ &gt; m₃, then similar logic applies, just switch left and right.

Therefore, regardless of the relative positions of the minima, there exists a k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Therefore, option (b) is true.

But wait, the answer options are (a), (b), (c), (d). Let&#x27;s check the options again:

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

From the analysis above:

- (a) is false because for any real k, f(x) = k has either two, three, or four real roots. There is no k where it has exactly one real root.

- (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima (or between the higher local minimum and the local maximum, but actually in our case, between m₁ and m₃, assuming m₁ &lt; m₃), the equation f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

Wait, earlier, when k is between m₁ and m₃, which are both minima, the horizontal line y = k intersects the graph three times: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots.

- (c) is false because when k is greater than M or less than m₁ (the lower of the two minima), f(x) = k has only two real roots.

- (d) is false because when k is between the two local minima or between a local minimum and the local maximum, f(x) = k has four or three real roots, respectively, so not always two real and two complex roots.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

But wait, the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, and the options are (a)-(d). The analysis above suggests that (b) is true. However, in the initial problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots. Wait, but in our analysis, we concluded that between the two local minima, we can get three real roots. But the key is that the quartic has three critical points: two minima and one maximum or two maxima and one minima, but in this case, with leading coefficient positive, it&#x27;s two minima and one maximum.

But let me verify with an example. Take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x + 1. Wait, maybe a simpler example. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 2x³ - 3x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 6x² - 6x. Let&#x27;s find the critical points.

Wait, maybe a better example is f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has three real roots: x = 0, x = sqrt(2), x = -sqrt(2). So the critical points are at x = -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). Then f(x) at these points: f(-sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(2))⁴ - 4*(sqrt(2))² = 4 - 8 = -4. f(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. f(sqrt(2)) = same as f(-sqrt(2)) = -4. So the local minima are at x = ±sqrt(2) with f(x) = -4, and the local maximum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0. So this is a symmetric quartic. Then, for k between -4 and 0, f(x) = k has four real roots. For k = 0, it has three real roots (double root at x = 0 and two at ±sqrt(something)). For k &lt; -4, two real roots. For k &gt; 0, two real roots. For k between the minima and the maximum (i.e., between -4 and 0), four real roots. For k exactly at -4, three real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). Wait, but in this case, the two minima are equal. So here, m₁ = m₃ = -4. Therefore, there is no interval between m₁ and m₃; they are the same. Therefore, in this symmetric case, when k is between -4 and 0, you get four real roots, but when k is exactly -4, you get two real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). However, the original problem states that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does: -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). So in this case, the two minima are equal. Therefore, if the two local minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are equal), so the three real roots case doesn&#x27;t occur. Wait, but the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; for f’(x). In this example, f’(x) has three distinct real roots. But in this case, the minima are equal, so between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, you get four real roots. But if the minima are not equal, then between them, you would have three real roots.

Therefore, the key is whether the two local minima can be at different heights. If f’(x) has three distinct real roots, but the function f(x) could still have two equal minima. Wait, but in the example above, even with symmetric critical points, the minima are equal. So perhaps, depending on the coefficients, the minima can be equal or not. Therefore, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether the minima are equal or not, only that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Therefore, in some cases, you might have equal minima, in others not. Therefore, the answer would depend on whether, regardless of the specific f(x) meeting the condition, statement (b) is always true.

But wait, in the example where minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are the same), so the three real roots case would not exist. However, in that case, when k is between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, which is the same as saying between m and M, you get four real roots. When k is less than m or greater than M, you get two real roots. When k equals m, you get two double roots. When k equals M, you get three real roots (a double root and two simple roots). Therefore, in the symmetric case, statement (b) is false because there is no k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. When k = M, you have three real roots but one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. When k is between m and M, you have four distinct real roots. When k is less than m, two distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric case, statement (b) is false. But the problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does, but the minima are equal. Therefore, the correct answer would not always be (b). Therefore, my previous analysis was incorrect.

Therefore, there&#x27;s a problem: if the quartic is symmetric, with two equal minima, then there is no k for which f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) would not hold in such cases. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot; given that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Since there exist such polynomials where statement (b) is false, but there also exist polynomials where statement (b) is true. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the statement must hold for all such polynomials or if there exists at least one. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, implying that the statement must be always true given the conditions.

Therefore, since there exists a polynomial where f’(x) has three distinct real roots but there&#x27;s no k with three distinct real roots (like the symmetric quartic example), statement (b) is not always true. Therefore, my previous conclusion was wrong.

Then, what is the correct answer? Let&#x27;s re-examine the options.

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

In the symmetric example, the only possible numbers of real roots are two (k &lt; m), four (m &lt; k &lt; M), three (k = m or k = M), or two (k &gt; M). So in this case, there is no k with exactly one real root. Therefore, statement (a) is false.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric example, when k = m or k = M, we have three real roots but with a double root, so they are not distinct. Therefore, in this case, there is no k with three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) is false.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

False, since for k &gt; M or k &lt; m, there are only two real roots.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

False, since for some k, there are four real roots.

Therefore, in this case, none of the options are true? But that can&#x27;t be, because the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the symmetric example. Let&#x27;s take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has roots at x = 0, sqrt(2), -sqrt(2). So three distinct real roots. The function f(x) = x⁴ - 4x² has local maxima at x = 0 (f(0) = 0) and local minima at x = ±sqrt(2) (f(±sqrt(2)) = -4). Then, for k = -4, the equation f(x) = -4 has double roots at x = ±sqrt(2). For k = 0, it has a double root at x = 0 and simple roots at x = ±2. So, in this case, when k = 0, the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. Therefore, three real roots, but only two distinct ones (x = 0 and x = ±2). Wait, no. If x = ±2 are roots, then total roots are x = 0 (double), x = 2, and x = -2. So four roots total, but with x = 0 counted twice. However, the equation x⁴ - 4x² = 0 factors as x²(x² - 4) = 0, so roots at x = 0 (multiplicity 2), x = 2, x = -2. So in this case, for k = 0, there are three distinct real roots (0, 2, -2), with one of them being a double root. Therefore, in terms of distinct real roots, it&#x27;s three. So, statement (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would be true here because even though 0 is a double root, the roots are still distinct: -2, 0, 2. So in this case, k = 0 gives three distinct real roots, even with a double root at 0. Therefore, perhaps in this example, statement (b) is true.

Wait, but if we take k = -4, then f(x) = -4 has roots at x = ±sqrt(2), each with multiplicity two. So, two distinct real roots, each a double root. Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is not satisfied for k = -4, but for k = 0, we have three distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric example, there does exist a k (specifically k = 0) such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) is true.

But earlier, I thought that when the minima are equal, there&#x27;s no k between them, but in reality, even in the symmetric case, there is a k (the local maximum) where you have three distinct real roots. So regardless of whether the minima are equal or not, the local maximum will always provide a k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Let me check.

In the symmetric example, at k = 0 (the local maximum), the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double root) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) holds.

If we take another example where the minima are not equal. Let’s construct a quartic with two unequal minima. For example, f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x. Compute its derivative: f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x² + 4x + 4. I need to check if this derivative has three distinct real roots. Instead of computing, maybe take a known quartic. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 6x² + 4x. Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x + 4. Let&#x27;s check the roots of f’(x). Maybe this cubic has three real roots. Alternatively, use f(x) = x⁴ - 3x³ - 3x² + 4x + 1. Not sure. Alternatively, take f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4), but that would have four real roots, but its derivative would have three critical points. However, expanding this would be time-consuming.

Alternatively, take a quartic with two minima at different heights. Suppose f(x) has a local minimum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0, a local maximum at x = 1 with f(1) = 2, and another local minimum at x = 2 with f(2) = 1. Then, the function would go from +infty down to 0 at x = 0, up to 2 at x = 1, down to 1 at x = 2, and back up to +infty. In this case, m₁ = 0, M = 2, m₃ = 1. Then, for k between m₁ = 0 and m₃ = 1, the equation f(x) = k would have three distinct real roots: one left of 0, one between 0 and 1, and one between 1 and 2. For k between m₃ = 1 and M = 2, four distinct real roots. For k = 1, three real roots (double root at x = 2 and two others). For k = 0, three real roots (double root at x = 0 and one other). For k = 2, three real roots (double root at x = 1 and two others). For k &lt; 0, two real roots; for k &gt; 2, two real roots.

Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k between 0 and 1 (the two minima) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric case, even though the minima are equal, there&#x27;s still a k = M where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots (with a double root at the local maximum). Wait, no. In the symmetric case, k = M is the local maximum. For example, in f(x) = x⁴ - 4x², the local maximum is at x = 0 with k = 0. The equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, even in the symmetric case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k (specifically k = M) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Even though one of them is a double root, but the roots are still distinct in terms of their x-values. Wait, no. A double root at x = 0 means that x = 0 is a repeated root, but the distinct roots are x = -2, x = 0, x = 2. Therefore, three distinct real roots. The multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect the distinctness. Therefore, even if there is a multiple root, as long as there are three separate x-values, it&#x27;s three distinct real roots. Therefore, in both symmetric and asymmetric cases, statement (b) holds.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) with real coefficients, we know that its derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) has three distinct real roots. This implies that \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum (since the leading coefficient is positive, the polynomial tends to \( +\infty \) as \( x \to \pm\infty \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Critical Points and Graph Shape**:
   - The polynomial \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum.
   - The graph of \( f(x) \) will have a &quot;W&quot; shape with two local minima and one local maximum.

2. **Behavior of \( f(x) = k \)**:
   - For \( k \) values greater than the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local maximum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the local maximum and the higher local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has four real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to either local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local minimum and two simple roots).

   - **(d)** False: \( f(x) = k \) can have four real roots for some \( k \), so it does not always have two real and two complex roots.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out which of the statements (a), (b), (c), or (d) is true given that the polynomial f(x) = x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d has a derivative f’(x) with three distinct real roots. Let me start by recalling some calculus and polynomial theory.

First, since f(x) is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, its derivative f’(x) is a cubic (degree 3) polynomial. The problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. That means the derivative has three distinct critical points where the slope of f(x) is zero. For a cubic polynomial to have three distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive, but I might not need to compute that here. The key takeaway is that the original function f(x) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum, or two local maxima and one local minimum. Since the derivative is a cubic with three real roots, it must alternate between increasing and decreasing appropriately.

Now, the graph of a quartic polynomial typically has a &quot;W&quot; shape or an &quot;M&quot; shape depending on the leading coefficient. Since the leading term here is x⁴, which has a positive coefficient, as x approaches positive or negative infinity, f(x) tends to positive infinity. Therefore, the graph will eventually rise on both ends. Given that the derivative has three real roots, there are three critical points. For a quartic with positive leading coefficient, the typical shape with three critical points would be two local minima and one local maximum in between. So, the graph would go up, then down, then up, then down, then up again? Wait, no. Wait, the derivative is cubic, so it can have three critical points. So the original function f(x) will have three turning points. Since it&#x27;s a quartic, it can have up to three turning points (since the derivative is cubic, which can have up to three roots). So with three critical points, the graph of f(x) will have two local minima and one local maximum, or two maxima and one minima. But given that the leading coefficient is positive, as x approaches ±∞, f(x) goes to +∞. Therefore, the rightmost and leftmost critical points must be minima. So the structure would be: starting from the left, the function decreases to a local maximum, then increases to a local minimum, then decreases again to a local maximum, and then increases to infinity? Wait, that doesn&#x27;t make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if the derivative has three real roots, then the original function f(x) has three critical points. Let me label them as x₁ &lt; x₂ &lt; x₃. Since the leading term is positive, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, and the same as x approaches -infty. So, the rightmost critical point x₃ must be a local minimum (since after that, the function increases to infinity), and the leftmost critical point x₁ must be a local maximum (since coming from -infty, the function is decreasing until x₁, then starts increasing). Wait, no, that seems contradictory. Let me check:

If x approaches -infty, f(x) tends to +infty, so as we move from left to right (from -infty to +infty), the function starts at +infty, then at some point x₁ (the leftmost critical point) it might turn. If x₁ is a local maximum, then after x₁, the function decreases. Then, at x₂, another critical point, which would have to be a local minimum, so after x₂, the function increases again. Then at x₃, another critical point, which would be a local maximum, and then after x₃, the function decreases. But wait, but after x₃, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, which is a contradiction because if x₃ is a local maximum, then after x₃, the function should decrease, but it actually needs to increase to +infty. Therefore, that can&#x27;t be. Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the leftmost critical point x₁ is a local minimum. Let&#x27;s see: starting from -infty, f(x) is going to +infty. Then at x₁, which is a local minimum, the function starts increasing. Then at x₂, a local maximum, so after x₂, the function decreases. Then at x₃, another local minimum, so after x₃, the function increases again towards +infty. That makes sense. So the critical points are arranged as local minimum at x₁, local maximum at x₂, local minimum at x₃. Therefore, the graph has two local minima and one local maximum.

So the function f(x) would start at +infty, decrease to a local minimum at x₁, then increase to a local maximum at x₂, then decrease to a local minimum at x₃, and then increase again to +infty. So, the graph would look like a &quot;W&quot; but with the middle peak being a local maximum and the two valleys being local minima. So, the function has two local minima and one local maximum.

Given that structure, let&#x27;s consider the possible number of real roots for f(x) = k. Depending on the value of k, the horizontal line y = k can intersect the graph of f(x) in different ways.

If k is greater than the value of the local maximum at x₂, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃, because the function only exceeds k on the far left and far right.

If k is exactly equal to the value of the local maximum at x₂, then f(x) = k would have three real roots: one at x₂ (with multiplicity two, since it&#x27;s a local maximum) and one on each side (left of x₁ and right of x₃). But wait, if the local maximum is exactly at k, then the graph touches the line y = k at x₂, so that&#x27;s a double root, and crosses the line on either side. So three real roots, but one of them is a double root.

If k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two local minima, then suppose the local minima at x₁ and x₃ have values m₁ and m₃. Let&#x27;s assume that one of the minima is lower than the other. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, both minima must be below the local maximum. However, depending on the specific coefficients, one minimum could be lower than the other. Let&#x27;s say, without loss of generality, that m₁ &lt; m₃ (the left local minimum is lower than the right local minimum). Then, if k is between m₃ and the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots: two on the left side (between -infty and x₁, and between x₁ and x₂), and two on the right side (between x₂ and x₃, and between x₃ and +infty). Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two minima, say between M and m₃ (assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), then when k is in (m₃, M), the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. But actually, when you have two minima and one maximum, the graph goes from +infty to m₁ (local min), rises to M (local max), then falls to m₃ (local min), then rises again to +infty. So if k is between m₁ and M, then depending on where k is relative to m₃, the number of roots changes.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch a rough graph mentally. Starting from the left (x approaching -infty), f(x) is at +infty, decreases to m₁ at x₁ (local min), then increases to M at x₂ (local max), then decreases to m₃ at x₃ (local min), then increases back to +infty.

So, if k is greater than M, then the equation f(x) = k has two real roots: one on the far left and one on the far right.

If k is equal to M, then it has three real roots: one at x₂ (a double root) and one on each side.

If k is between m₃ and M, then it has four real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, one between x₂ and x₃, and one right of x₃.

If k is equal to m₃, then it has three real roots: one at x₃ (double root) and one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂.

If k is between m₁ and m₃, then it has two real roots: one left of x₁ and one right of x₃, because the horizontal line y = k only intersects the graph on the leftmost and rightmost ascending parts. Wait, but between x₁ and x₃, the function reaches a maximum at x₂, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, then the line y = k would cross the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. Wait, but if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the minima, but since m₁ is lower than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ to M, so it must cross y = k once there. Similarly, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then since m₃ is higher than m₁, and k is between m₁ and m₃, then on the interval x₂ to x₃, the function decreases from M to m₃, crossing y = k once. Similarly, on the interval x₃ to +infty, the function increases from m₃ to +infty, so y = k would cross once there. Similarly, on the interval -infty to x₁, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, crossing y = k once. Therefore, actually, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots. If k is equal to m₁, then it&#x27;s a double root at x₁ and another root on the right. Similarly, if k is equal to m₃, it&#x27;s a double root at x₃ and another root on the left. If k is less than m₁, since m₁ is the lower of the two minima, then the line y = k would intersect the graph only twice: once left of x₁ and once right of x₃. Wait, no. If k is less than m₁, which is the minimum, then the graph only reaches down to m₁, so y = k would not intersect the graph at all? Wait, no. Wait, as x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches +infty, and at x₁, it&#x27;s a local minimum m₁. So if k &lt; m₁, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃? Wait, but if k is less than m₁, which is the minimum value on the left side, then on the left side, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, so it must cross y = k once. On the right side, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is higher than m₁) up to +infty, so if k is less than m₁, then since m₃ is greater than m₁, and k is less than m₁, then on the right side, the function starts at m₃ (which is greater than k) and increases to infinity, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, if k &lt; m₁, there is only one real root on the left side. Similarly, if k &gt; M, there are two real roots on the extremes. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to tabulate the different cases.

Let me denote:

- The leftmost local minimum at x = x₁ with f(x₁) = m₁.

- The local maximum at x = x₂ with f(x₂) = M.

- The rightmost local minimum at x = x₃ with f(x₃) = m₃.

Assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ (since x₁ &lt; x₃ and the function might have asymmetrical minima), though it could also be m₃ &lt; m₁. Wait, but since the function is going from m₁ up to M, then down to m₃, and then up again. The relative positions of m₁ and m₃ depend on the specific coefficients. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify, so I can&#x27;t assume which is lower. Therefore, perhaps I need to consider both possibilities. But maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter. Let&#x27;s suppose m₁ ≤ m₃ for definiteness. Then:

- If k &gt; M: two real roots (left and right).

- If k = M: three real roots (one double root at x₂ and two simple roots on the sides).

- If m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots (left, between x₁ and x₂, between x₂ and x₃, right).

- If k = m₃: three real roots (double root at x₃ and two others).

- If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: four real roots (similar to above? Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, but the function between x₁ and x₂ goes up to M, which is higher than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function crosses y = k once (since it goes from m₁ to M), between x₂ and x₃, it crosses once (since it goes from M to m₃), and on both ends, left of x₁ and right of x₃, the function is above k? Wait, no. Wait, the left end (x approaching -infty) is +infty, so coming from the left, the function starts at +infty, decreases to m₁ (which is less than k, since k &gt; m₁), so it must cross y = k once on the left side (before x₁). Then, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross there. Wait, but m₃ is greater than k, so after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so if m₃ &gt; k, then it never crosses y = k again. Therefore, in this case, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k has three real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, and one between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought.

Wait, perhaps I need to more carefully analyze:

Case 1: k &gt; M. Then, the horizontal line y = k cuts the graph at two points: one far left (before x₁) and one far right (after x₃).

Case 2: k = M. The line touches the local maximum at x₂ and cuts the graph on the left and right sides, resulting in three real roots (one double root at x₂).

Case 3: m₃ &lt; k &lt; M. The line y = k intersects the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃.

Wait, but if m₃ is the right local minimum, and k is greater than m₃ but less than M, then after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so since k &gt; m₃, there will be a crossing right of x₃. Similarly, left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is less than k (since k &gt; m₃ and m₃ &gt; m₁, so k &gt; m₁). Therefore, left of x₁, the function crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ (which is less than k) up to M (which is greater than k), so crosses once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is less than k), so crosses once. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to infinity, crossing once. Therefore, four crossings. So that&#x27;s four real roots.

Case 4: k = m₃. The line touches the local minimum at x₃, so it&#x27;s a double root there, and crosses the graph left of x₁ and between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so at k = m₃, it only touches at x₃. Therefore, the roots would be left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂ (since the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing k = m₃ if m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), but wait, m₃ is the value at x₃, which is a local minimum. If k = m₃, then between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so it reaches m₃ at x₃. Therefore, if k = m₃, then there&#x27;s a root at x₃ (double root) and another root left of x₁ (since the function decreases from +infty to m₁, which is less than m₃, so crosses y = m₃ once left of x₁) and another root between x₁ and x₂ (as the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing y = m₃ once). So total of three roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and a double root at x₃.

Case 5: m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃. Here, k is between the two local minima. Since m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum. Let&#x27;s assume m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph as follows:

- Left of x₁: the function comes down from +infty to m₁, which is less than k, so it crosses y = k once.

- Between x₁ and x₂: the function goes from m₁ (less than k) up to M (greater than k), so crosses once.

- Between x₂ and x₃: the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so crosses once.

- Right of x₃: the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = k there.

Therefore, total of three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃.

Wait, but hold on. If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃, then m₃ is greater than k, so right of x₃, the function starts at m₃ and goes up, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, only three real roots? But earlier, when k is between m₃ and M, we had four roots. Hmm.

Case 6: k = m₁. The line touches the left local minimum at x₁, resulting in a double root there. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than m₁), so if k = m₁, which is less than m₃, the function crosses y = k once between x₂ and x₃. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ to +infty, which is above k, so no crossing. Also, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M, so crosses y = k once. Wait, but if k = m₁, then between x₁ and x₂, the function starts at m₁ (k) and goes up, so the crossing is exactly at x₁, which is a double root. Then, another crossing between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, three real roots: double root at x₁ and single roots between x₂ and x₃ and right of x₃? Wait, no. Wait, if k = m₁, then at x₁, the function has a local minimum. So the graph touches y = k at x₁, and then goes up. On the left side, as x approaches -infty, the function approaches +infty, so it comes down from +infty to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, left of x₁, there&#x27;s no crossing since it&#x27;s decreasing to m₁. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root because it&#x27;s a local minimum). Then, moving from x₁ to x₂, the function increases to M, which is greater than m₁, so there&#x27;s no crossing there. Then, from x₂ to x₃, the function decreases to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Then, from x₃ to +infty, the function increases to +infty, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = m₁ again. Therefore, total of two real roots: a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but the original function at x approaching -infty is +infty, so when approaching from the left, the function decreases to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, for k = m₁, the leftmost intersection is exactly at x₁ (a double root), and then another intersection between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, two real roots (one double, one single). But in the context of the problem, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot; or &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, do they count multiplicity? The problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for option (a). If they count multiplicity, then at k = m₁, f(x) = k has two real roots (one double, one single). If they don&#x27;t count multiplicity, then maybe it&#x27;s considered as two real roots (but one is a double root). Wait, the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;. So if multiplicity is considered, then a double root would count as one root, but actually, in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s still one. Wait, no. Wait, multiplicity is about the number of roots counting multiplicity. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, which might mean exactly one distinct real root, or exactly one real root counting multiplicity. The question is ambiguous, but in standard terminology, &quot;exactly one real root&quot; usually refers to exactly one distinct real root, but in some contexts, it might count multiplicity. However, in options (b) and (c), they mention &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; and &quot;four distinct real roots&quot;, so it seems like they are distinguishing between distinct roots and multiple roots. Therefore, for (a), &quot;exactly one real root&quot; probably means exactly one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. Similarly, for (b), &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;. So in the case where k = m₁, we have a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃, so that&#x27;s two distinct real roots (x₁ with multiplicity two and another root). Therefore, (a) is not satisfied here.

Case 7: k &lt; m₁. Then, the horizontal line y = k is below both local minima. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, the line y = k would intersect the graph twice: once on the far left (before x₁) and once on the far right (after x₃). Therefore, two real roots.

So summarizing:

- k &gt; M: two real roots.

- k = M: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots.

- k = m₃: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: three real roots.

- k = m₁: three real roots (one double, two simple? Wait, earlier analysis said two roots, but maybe I messed up).

Wait, let me re-examine k = m₁. If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root) and since between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, total of two distinct real roots: x₁ (double) and one between x₂ and x₃. So, in terms of distinct roots, two; in terms of total roots counting multiplicity, three. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for (a). If &quot;exactly one&quot; means one distinct root, then even if it&#x27;s a double root, that would still be considered one real root. But in standard terminology, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, they usually mean one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. However, in the case of k = M, we have three real roots but one is a double root. The problem&#x27;s option (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, so distinctness is important there. So, for (a), if there exists a k where f(x) = k has exactly one real root (distinct or not?), the answer depends on that.

But in the case where k is less than m₁, we have two distinct real roots. If k is equal to m₁, we have two real roots (x₁ is a double root, and another one). If k is between m₁ and m₃, three real roots. If k is equal to m₃ or M, three real roots (with a double root). If k is between m₃ and M, four real roots. If k is greater than M, two real roots.

Wait, but in none of these cases do we have exactly one real root. Even when k is less than m₁, we have two real roots. When k equals m₁ or m₃ or M, we have two or three real roots but with multiplicities. So, there is no k for which f(x) = k has exactly one real root, right? Unless when the polynomial is tangent to the line y = k at one point and doesn&#x27;t cross it elsewhere, but given the shape of the quartic, which tends to +infty on both sides, if the horizontal line is tangent at the local maximum or one of the minima, it will still cross the graph on one side or the other. Wait, for example, if k is equal to the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = M has a double root at x₂ and two other roots on the left and right. Wait, no. Wait, at k = M, the horizontal line touches the local maximum at x₂. To the left of x₂, the function is increasing from m₁ to M, so it only reaches M at x₂. To the right of x₂, the function decreases from M to m₃ and then increases again. Therefore, the line y = M would intersect the graph only at x₂ (a double root) and on the right side as the function increases past M again? Wait, no. Wait, after x₃, the function increases from m₃ to +infty. If M is the local maximum, then m₃ is less than M. So, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is less than M) up to +infty, so it must cross y = M once after x₃. Similarly, to the left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁ (which is less than M), so it must cross y = M once before x₁. Therefore, when k = M, the equation f(x) = M has three real roots: one at x₂ (double root) and one on each side. Therefore, three distinct real roots? Wait, but x₂ is a double root, so in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s three: x₂, and one on each side. So multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect distinctness. Therefore, even though x₂ is a double root, it&#x27;s still one distinct root. So in that case, k = M gives three distinct real roots, with one of them being a double root. Wait, no. If a root is a double root, it&#x27;s still a single distinct root; the distinctness refers to the x-values. So x₂ is one distinct root, and the other two are also distinct. So in total, three distinct real roots, one with multiplicity two. Therefore, for the problem&#x27;s option (b): &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Well, when k = M or k = m₁ or k = m₃, you have three real roots, but with one double root. But the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would require all three roots to be distinct, i.e., no multiple roots. So in that case, even though at k = M you have three real roots, one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. Therefore, the answer would be that statement (b) is false. Wait, but when k is between m₃ and M, we have four distinct real roots. When k is between m₁ and m₃, three distinct real roots. When k is less than m₁ or greater than M, two distinct real roots. When k equals M, m₁, or m₃, three real roots with one double root.

Therefore, the statement (b) says: &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Given that when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three distinct real roots (as per the earlier analysis). Wait, earlier I thought when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three real roots. Wait, let&#x27;s recheck.

Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two local minima, then depending on the graph, how does the horizontal line intersect? Suppose m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum, with m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, k between m₁ and m₃ would be above m₁ and below m₃. Then, on the left side (x &lt; x₁), the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is below k, so it crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is above k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross. Therefore, three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots because they are in different intervals. Therefore, statement (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima, we get three distinct real roots. Additionally, if m₁ &gt; m₃, then similar logic applies, just switch left and right.

Therefore, regardless of the relative positions of the minima, there exists a k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Therefore, option (b) is true.

But wait, the answer options are (a), (b), (c), (d). Let&#x27;s check the options again:

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

From the analysis above:

- (a) is false because for any real k, f(x) = k has either two, three, or four real roots. There is no k where it has exactly one real root.

- (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima (or between the higher local minimum and the local maximum, but actually in our case, between m₁ and m₃, assuming m₁ &lt; m₃), the equation f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

Wait, earlier, when k is between m₁ and m₃, which are both minima, the horizontal line y = k intersects the graph three times: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots.

- (c) is false because when k is greater than M or less than m₁ (the lower of the two minima), f(x) = k has only two real roots.

- (d) is false because when k is between the two local minima or between a local minimum and the local maximum, f(x) = k has four or three real roots, respectively, so not always two real and two complex roots.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

But wait, the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, and the options are (a)-(d). The analysis above suggests that (b) is true. However, in the initial problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots. Wait, but in our analysis, we concluded that between the two local minima, we can get three real roots. But the key is that the quartic has three critical points: two minima and one maximum or two maxima and one minima, but in this case, with leading coefficient positive, it&#x27;s two minima and one maximum.

But let me verify with an example. Take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x + 1. Wait, maybe a simpler example. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 2x³ - 3x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 6x² - 6x. Let&#x27;s find the critical points.

Wait, maybe a better example is f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has three real roots: x = 0, x = sqrt(2), x = -sqrt(2). So the critical points are at x = -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). Then f(x) at these points: f(-sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(2))⁴ - 4*(sqrt(2))² = 4 - 8 = -4. f(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. f(sqrt(2)) = same as f(-sqrt(2)) = -4. So the local minima are at x = ±sqrt(2) with f(x) = -4, and the local maximum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0. So this is a symmetric quartic. Then, for k between -4 and 0, f(x) = k has four real roots. For k = 0, it has three real roots (double root at x = 0 and two at ±sqrt(something)). For k &lt; -4, two real roots. For k &gt; 0, two real roots. For k between the minima and the maximum (i.e., between -4 and 0), four real roots. For k exactly at -4, three real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). Wait, but in this case, the two minima are equal. So here, m₁ = m₃ = -4. Therefore, there is no interval between m₁ and m₃; they are the same. Therefore, in this symmetric case, when k is between -4 and 0, you get four real roots, but when k is exactly -4, you get two real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). However, the original problem states that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does: -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). So in this case, the two minima are equal. Therefore, if the two local minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are equal), so the three real roots case doesn&#x27;t occur. Wait, but the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; for f’(x). In this example, f’(x) has three distinct real roots. But in this case, the minima are equal, so between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, you get four real roots. But if the minima are not equal, then between them, you would have three real roots.

Therefore, the key is whether the two local minima can be at different heights. If f’(x) has three distinct real roots, but the function f(x) could still have two equal minima. Wait, but in the example above, even with symmetric critical points, the minima are equal. So perhaps, depending on the coefficients, the minima can be equal or not. Therefore, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether the minima are equal or not, only that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Therefore, in some cases, you might have equal minima, in others not. Therefore, the answer would depend on whether, regardless of the specific f(x) meeting the condition, statement (b) is always true.

But wait, in the example where minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are the same), so the three real roots case would not exist. However, in that case, when k is between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, which is the same as saying between m and M, you get four real roots. When k is less than m or greater than M, you get two real roots. When k equals m, you get two double roots. When k equals M, you get three real roots (a double root and two simple roots). Therefore, in the symmetric case, statement (b) is false because there is no k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. When k = M, you have three real roots but one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. When k is between m and M, you have four distinct real roots. When k is less than m, two distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric case, statement (b) is false. But the problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does, but the minima are equal. Therefore, the correct answer would not always be (b). Therefore, my previous analysis was incorrect.

Therefore, there&#x27;s a problem: if the quartic is symmetric, with two equal minima, then there is no k for which f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) would not hold in such cases. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot; given that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Since there exist such polynomials where statement (b) is false, but there also exist polynomials where statement (b) is true. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the statement must hold for all such polynomials or if there exists at least one. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, implying that the statement must be always true given the conditions.

Therefore, since there exists a polynomial where f’(x) has three distinct real roots but there&#x27;s no k with three distinct real roots (like the symmetric quartic example), statement (b) is not always true. Therefore, my previous conclusion was wrong.

Then, what is the correct answer? Let&#x27;s re-examine the options.

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

In the symmetric example, the only possible numbers of real roots are two (k &lt; m), four (m &lt; k &lt; M), three (k = m or k = M), or two (k &gt; M). So in this case, there is no k with exactly one real root. Therefore, statement (a) is false.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric example, when k = m or k = M, we have three real roots but with a double root, so they are not distinct. Therefore, in this case, there is no k with three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) is false.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

False, since for k &gt; M or k &lt; m, there are only two real roots.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

False, since for some k, there are four real roots.

Therefore, in this case, none of the options are true? But that can&#x27;t be, because the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the symmetric example. Let&#x27;s take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has roots at x = 0, sqrt(2), -sqrt(2). So three distinct real roots. The function f(x) = x⁴ - 4x² has local maxima at x = 0 (f(0) = 0) and local minima at x = ±sqrt(2) (f(±sqrt(2)) = -4). Then, for k = -4, the equation f(x) = -4 has double roots at x = ±sqrt(2). For k = 0, it has a double root at x = 0 and simple roots at x = ±2. So, in this case, when k = 0, the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. Therefore, three real roots, but only two distinct ones (x = 0 and x = ±2). Wait, no. If x = ±2 are roots, then total roots are x = 0 (double), x = 2, and x = -2. So four roots total, but with x = 0 counted twice. However, the equation x⁴ - 4x² = 0 factors as x²(x² - 4) = 0, so roots at x = 0 (multiplicity 2), x = 2, x = -2. So in this case, for k = 0, there are three distinct real roots (0, 2, -2), with one of them being a double root. Therefore, in terms of distinct real roots, it&#x27;s three. So, statement (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would be true here because even though 0 is a double root, the roots are still distinct: -2, 0, 2. So in this case, k = 0 gives three distinct real roots, even with a double root at 0. Therefore, perhaps in this example, statement (b) is true.

Wait, but if we take k = -4, then f(x) = -4 has roots at x = ±sqrt(2), each with multiplicity two. So, two distinct real roots, each a double root. Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is not satisfied for k = -4, but for k = 0, we have three distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric example, there does exist a k (specifically k = 0) such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) is true.

But earlier, I thought that when the minima are equal, there&#x27;s no k between them, but in reality, even in the symmetric case, there is a k (the local maximum) where you have three distinct real roots. So regardless of whether the minima are equal or not, the local maximum will always provide a k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Let me check.

In the symmetric example, at k = 0 (the local maximum), the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double root) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) holds.

If we take another example where the minima are not equal. Let’s construct a quartic with two unequal minima. For example, f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x. Compute its derivative: f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x² + 4x + 4. I need to check if this derivative has three distinct real roots. Instead of computing, maybe take a known quartic. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 6x² + 4x. Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x + 4. Let&#x27;s check the roots of f’(x). Maybe this cubic has three real roots. Alternatively, use f(x) = x⁴ - 3x³ - 3x² + 4x + 1. Not sure. Alternatively, take f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4), but that would have four real roots, but its derivative would have three critical points. However, expanding this would be time-consuming.

Alternatively, take a quartic with two minima at different heights. Suppose f(x) has a local minimum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0, a local maximum at x = 1 with f(1) = 2, and another local minimum at x = 2 with f(2) = 1. Then, the function would go from +infty down to 0 at x = 0, up to 2 at x = 1, down to 1 at x = 2, and back up to +infty. In this case, m₁ = 0, M = 2, m₃ = 1. Then, for k between m₁ = 0 and m₃ = 1, the equation f(x) = k would have three distinct real roots: one left of 0, one between 0 and 1, and one between 1 and 2. For k between m₃ = 1 and M = 2, four distinct real roots. For k = 1, three real roots (double root at x = 2 and two others). For k = 0, three real roots (double root at x = 0 and one other). For k = 2, three real roots (double root at x = 1 and two others). For k &lt; 0, two real roots; for k &gt; 2, two real roots.

Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k between 0 and 1 (the two minima) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric case, even though the minima are equal, there&#x27;s still a k = M where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots (with a double root at the local maximum). Wait, no. In the symmetric case, k = M is the local maximum. For example, in f(x) = x⁴ - 4x², the local maximum is at x = 0 with k = 0. The equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, even in the symmetric case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k (specifically k = M) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Even though one of them is a double root, but the roots are still distinct in terms of their x-values. Wait, no. A double root at x = 0 means that x = 0 is a repeated root, but the distinct roots are x = -2, x = 0, x = 2. Therefore, three distinct real roots. The multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect the distinctness. Therefore, even if there is a multiple root, as long as there are three separate x-values, it&#x27;s three distinct real roots. Therefore, in both symmetric and asymmetric cases, statement (b) holds.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) with real coefficients, we know that its derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) has three distinct real roots. This implies that \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum (since the leading coefficient is positive, the polynomial tends to \( +\infty \) as \( x \to \pm\infty \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Critical Points and Graph Shape**:
   - The polynomial \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum.
   - The graph of \( f(x) \) will have a &quot;W&quot; shape with two local minima and one local maximum.

2. **Behavior of \( f(x) = k \)**:
   - For \( k \) values greater than the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local maximum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the local maximum and the higher local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has four real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to either local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local minimum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the two local minima, \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - For \( k \) values less than the lower local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.

3. **Evaluation of Statements**:
   - **(a)** False: There is no \( k \) such that \( f(x) = k \) has exactly one real root.
   - **(b)** True: There exists a \( k \) (between the two local minima) where \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - **(c)** False: \( f(x) = k \) does not always have four distinct real roots (e.g., for \( k \) outside the range between the local minima and maximum).
   - **(d)** False: \( f(x) = k \) can have four real roots for some \( k \), so it does not always have two real and two complex roots.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out which of the statements (a), (b), (c), or (d) is true given that the polynomial f(x) = x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d has a derivative f’(x) with three distinct real roots. Let me start by recalling some calculus and polynomial theory.

First, since f(x) is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, its derivative f’(x) is a cubic (degree 3) polynomial. The problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. That means the derivative has three distinct critical points where the slope of f(x) is zero. For a cubic polynomial to have three distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive, but I might not need to compute that here. The key takeaway is that the original function f(x) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum, or two local maxima and one local minimum. Since the derivative is a cubic with three real roots, it must alternate between increasing and decreasing appropriately.

Now, the graph of a quartic polynomial typically has a &quot;W&quot; shape or an &quot;M&quot; shape depending on the leading coefficient. Since the leading term here is x⁴, which has a positive coefficient, as x approaches positive or negative infinity, f(x) tends to positive infinity. Therefore, the graph will eventually rise on both ends. Given that the derivative has three real roots, there are three critical points. For a quartic with positive leading coefficient, the typical shape with three critical points would be two local minima and one local maximum in between. So, the graph would go up, then down, then up, then down, then up again? Wait, no. Wait, the derivative is cubic, so it can have three critical points. So the original function f(x) will have three turning points. Since it&#x27;s a quartic, it can have up to three turning points (since the derivative is cubic, which can have up to three roots). So with three critical points, the graph of f(x) will have two local minima and one local maximum, or two maxima and one minima. But given that the leading coefficient is positive, as x approaches ±∞, f(x) goes to +∞. Therefore, the rightmost and leftmost critical points must be minima. So the structure would be: starting from the left, the function decreases to a local maximum, then increases to a local minimum, then decreases again to a local maximum, and then increases to infinity? Wait, that doesn&#x27;t make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if the derivative has three real roots, then the original function f(x) has three critical points. Let me label them as x₁ &lt; x₂ &lt; x₃. Since the leading term is positive, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, and the same as x approaches -infty. So, the rightmost critical point x₃ must be a local minimum (since after that, the function increases to infinity), and the leftmost critical point x₁ must be a local maximum (since coming from -infty, the function is decreasing until x₁, then starts increasing). Wait, no, that seems contradictory. Let me check:

If x approaches -infty, f(x) tends to +infty, so as we move from left to right (from -infty to +infty), the function starts at +infty, then at some point x₁ (the leftmost critical point) it might turn. If x₁ is a local maximum, then after x₁, the function decreases. Then, at x₂, another critical point, which would have to be a local minimum, so after x₂, the function increases again. Then at x₃, another critical point, which would be a local maximum, and then after x₃, the function decreases. But wait, but after x₃, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, which is a contradiction because if x₃ is a local maximum, then after x₃, the function should decrease, but it actually needs to increase to +infty. Therefore, that can&#x27;t be. Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the leftmost critical point x₁ is a local minimum. Let&#x27;s see: starting from -infty, f(x) is going to +infty. Then at x₁, which is a local minimum, the function starts increasing. Then at x₂, a local maximum, so after x₂, the function decreases. Then at x₃, another local minimum, so after x₃, the function increases again towards +infty. That makes sense. So the critical points are arranged as local minimum at x₁, local maximum at x₂, local minimum at x₃. Therefore, the graph has two local minima and one local maximum.

So the function f(x) would start at +infty, decrease to a local minimum at x₁, then increase to a local maximum at x₂, then decrease to a local minimum at x₃, and then increase again to +infty. So, the graph would look like a &quot;W&quot; but with the middle peak being a local maximum and the two valleys being local minima. So, the function has two local minima and one local maximum.

Given that structure, let&#x27;s consider the possible number of real roots for f(x) = k. Depending on the value of k, the horizontal line y = k can intersect the graph of f(x) in different ways.

If k is greater than the value of the local maximum at x₂, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃, because the function only exceeds k on the far left and far right.

If k is exactly equal to the value of the local maximum at x₂, then f(x) = k would have three real roots: one at x₂ (with multiplicity two, since it&#x27;s a local maximum) and one on each side (left of x₁ and right of x₃). But wait, if the local maximum is exactly at k, then the graph touches the line y = k at x₂, so that&#x27;s a double root, and crosses the line on either side. So three real roots, but one of them is a double root.

If k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two local minima, then suppose the local minima at x₁ and x₃ have values m₁ and m₃. Let&#x27;s assume that one of the minima is lower than the other. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, both minima must be below the local maximum. However, depending on the specific coefficients, one minimum could be lower than the other. Let&#x27;s say, without loss of generality, that m₁ &lt; m₃ (the left local minimum is lower than the right local minimum). Then, if k is between m₃ and the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots: two on the left side (between -infty and x₁, and between x₁ and x₂), and two on the right side (between x₂ and x₃, and between x₃ and +infty). Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two minima, say between M and m₃ (assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), then when k is in (m₃, M), the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. But actually, when you have two minima and one maximum, the graph goes from +infty to m₁ (local min), rises to M (local max), then falls to m₃ (local min), then rises again to +infty. So if k is between m₁ and M, then depending on where k is relative to m₃, the number of roots changes.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch a rough graph mentally. Starting from the left (x approaching -infty), f(x) is at +infty, decreases to m₁ at x₁ (local min), then increases to M at x₂ (local max), then decreases to m₃ at x₃ (local min), then increases back to +infty.

So, if k is greater than M, then the equation f(x) = k has two real roots: one on the far left and one on the far right.

If k is equal to M, then it has three real roots: one at x₂ (a double root) and one on each side.

If k is between m₃ and M, then it has four real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, one between x₂ and x₃, and one right of x₃.

If k is equal to m₃, then it has three real roots: one at x₃ (double root) and one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂.

If k is between m₁ and m₃, then it has two real roots: one left of x₁ and one right of x₃, because the horizontal line y = k only intersects the graph on the leftmost and rightmost ascending parts. Wait, but between x₁ and x₃, the function reaches a maximum at x₂, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, then the line y = k would cross the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. Wait, but if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the minima, but since m₁ is lower than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ to M, so it must cross y = k once there. Similarly, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then since m₃ is higher than m₁, and k is between m₁ and m₃, then on the interval x₂ to x₃, the function decreases from M to m₃, crossing y = k once. Similarly, on the interval x₃ to +infty, the function increases from m₃ to +infty, so y = k would cross once there. Similarly, on the interval -infty to x₁, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, crossing y = k once. Therefore, actually, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots. If k is equal to m₁, then it&#x27;s a double root at x₁ and another root on the right. Similarly, if k is equal to m₃, it&#x27;s a double root at x₃ and another root on the left. If k is less than m₁, since m₁ is the lower of the two minima, then the line y = k would intersect the graph only twice: once left of x₁ and once right of x₃. Wait, no. If k is less than m₁, which is the minimum, then the graph only reaches down to m₁, so y = k would not intersect the graph at all? Wait, no. Wait, as x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches +infty, and at x₁, it&#x27;s a local minimum m₁. So if k &lt; m₁, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃? Wait, but if k is less than m₁, which is the minimum value on the left side, then on the left side, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, so it must cross y = k once. On the right side, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is higher than m₁) up to +infty, so if k is less than m₁, then since m₃ is greater than m₁, and k is less than m₁, then on the right side, the function starts at m₃ (which is greater than k) and increases to infinity, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, if k &lt; m₁, there is only one real root on the left side. Similarly, if k &gt; M, there are two real roots on the extremes. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to tabulate the different cases.

Let me denote:

- The leftmost local minimum at x = x₁ with f(x₁) = m₁.

- The local maximum at x = x₂ with f(x₂) = M.

- The rightmost local minimum at x = x₃ with f(x₃) = m₃.

Assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ (since x₁ &lt; x₃ and the function might have asymmetrical minima), though it could also be m₃ &lt; m₁. Wait, but since the function is going from m₁ up to M, then down to m₃, and then up again. The relative positions of m₁ and m₃ depend on the specific coefficients. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify, so I can&#x27;t assume which is lower. Therefore, perhaps I need to consider both possibilities. But maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter. Let&#x27;s suppose m₁ ≤ m₃ for definiteness. Then:

- If k &gt; M: two real roots (left and right).

- If k = M: three real roots (one double root at x₂ and two simple roots on the sides).

- If m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots (left, between x₁ and x₂, between x₂ and x₃, right).

- If k = m₃: three real roots (double root at x₃ and two others).

- If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: four real roots (similar to above? Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, but the function between x₁ and x₂ goes up to M, which is higher than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function crosses y = k once (since it goes from m₁ to M), between x₂ and x₃, it crosses once (since it goes from M to m₃), and on both ends, left of x₁ and right of x₃, the function is above k? Wait, no. Wait, the left end (x approaching -infty) is +infty, so coming from the left, the function starts at +infty, decreases to m₁ (which is less than k, since k &gt; m₁), so it must cross y = k once on the left side (before x₁). Then, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross there. Wait, but m₃ is greater than k, so after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so if m₃ &gt; k, then it never crosses y = k again. Therefore, in this case, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k has three real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, and one between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought.

Wait, perhaps I need to more carefully analyze:

Case 1: k &gt; M. Then, the horizontal line y = k cuts the graph at two points: one far left (before x₁) and one far right (after x₃).

Case 2: k = M. The line touches the local maximum at x₂ and cuts the graph on the left and right sides, resulting in three real roots (one double root at x₂).

Case 3: m₃ &lt; k &lt; M. The line y = k intersects the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃.

Wait, but if m₃ is the right local minimum, and k is greater than m₃ but less than M, then after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so since k &gt; m₃, there will be a crossing right of x₃. Similarly, left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is less than k (since k &gt; m₃ and m₃ &gt; m₁, so k &gt; m₁). Therefore, left of x₁, the function crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ (which is less than k) up to M (which is greater than k), so crosses once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is less than k), so crosses once. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to infinity, crossing once. Therefore, four crossings. So that&#x27;s four real roots.

Case 4: k = m₃. The line touches the local minimum at x₃, so it&#x27;s a double root there, and crosses the graph left of x₁ and between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so at k = m₃, it only touches at x₃. Therefore, the roots would be left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂ (since the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing k = m₃ if m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), but wait, m₃ is the value at x₃, which is a local minimum. If k = m₃, then between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so it reaches m₃ at x₃. Therefore, if k = m₃, then there&#x27;s a root at x₃ (double root) and another root left of x₁ (since the function decreases from +infty to m₁, which is less than m₃, so crosses y = m₃ once left of x₁) and another root between x₁ and x₂ (as the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing y = m₃ once). So total of three roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and a double root at x₃.

Case 5: m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃. Here, k is between the two local minima. Since m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum. Let&#x27;s assume m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph as follows:

- Left of x₁: the function comes down from +infty to m₁, which is less than k, so it crosses y = k once.

- Between x₁ and x₂: the function goes from m₁ (less than k) up to M (greater than k), so crosses once.

- Between x₂ and x₃: the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so crosses once.

- Right of x₃: the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = k there.

Therefore, total of three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃.

Wait, but hold on. If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃, then m₃ is greater than k, so right of x₃, the function starts at m₃ and goes up, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, only three real roots? But earlier, when k is between m₃ and M, we had four roots. Hmm.

Case 6: k = m₁. The line touches the left local minimum at x₁, resulting in a double root there. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than m₁), so if k = m₁, which is less than m₃, the function crosses y = k once between x₂ and x₃. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ to +infty, which is above k, so no crossing. Also, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M, so crosses y = k once. Wait, but if k = m₁, then between x₁ and x₂, the function starts at m₁ (k) and goes up, so the crossing is exactly at x₁, which is a double root. Then, another crossing between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, three real roots: double root at x₁ and single roots between x₂ and x₃ and right of x₃? Wait, no. Wait, if k = m₁, then at x₁, the function has a local minimum. So the graph touches y = k at x₁, and then goes up. On the left side, as x approaches -infty, the function approaches +infty, so it comes down from +infty to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, left of x₁, there&#x27;s no crossing since it&#x27;s decreasing to m₁. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root because it&#x27;s a local minimum). Then, moving from x₁ to x₂, the function increases to M, which is greater than m₁, so there&#x27;s no crossing there. Then, from x₂ to x₃, the function decreases to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Then, from x₃ to +infty, the function increases to +infty, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = m₁ again. Therefore, total of two real roots: a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but the original function at x approaching -infty is +infty, so when approaching from the left, the function decreases to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, for k = m₁, the leftmost intersection is exactly at x₁ (a double root), and then another intersection between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, two real roots (one double, one single). But in the context of the problem, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot; or &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, do they count multiplicity? The problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for option (a). If they count multiplicity, then at k = m₁, f(x) = k has two real roots (one double, one single). If they don&#x27;t count multiplicity, then maybe it&#x27;s considered as two real roots (but one is a double root). Wait, the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;. So if multiplicity is considered, then a double root would count as one root, but actually, in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s still one. Wait, no. Wait, multiplicity is about the number of roots counting multiplicity. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, which might mean exactly one distinct real root, or exactly one real root counting multiplicity. The question is ambiguous, but in standard terminology, &quot;exactly one real root&quot; usually refers to exactly one distinct real root, but in some contexts, it might count multiplicity. However, in options (b) and (c), they mention &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; and &quot;four distinct real roots&quot;, so it seems like they are distinguishing between distinct roots and multiple roots. Therefore, for (a), &quot;exactly one real root&quot; probably means exactly one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. Similarly, for (b), &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;. So in the case where k = m₁, we have a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃, so that&#x27;s two distinct real roots (x₁ with multiplicity two and another root). Therefore, (a) is not satisfied here.

Case 7: k &lt; m₁. Then, the horizontal line y = k is below both local minima. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, the line y = k would intersect the graph twice: once on the far left (before x₁) and once on the far right (after x₃). Therefore, two real roots.

So summarizing:

- k &gt; M: two real roots.

- k = M: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots.

- k = m₃: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: three real roots.

- k = m₁: three real roots (one double, two simple? Wait, earlier analysis said two roots, but maybe I messed up).

Wait, let me re-examine k = m₁. If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root) and since between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, total of two distinct real roots: x₁ (double) and one between x₂ and x₃. So, in terms of distinct roots, two; in terms of total roots counting multiplicity, three. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for (a). If &quot;exactly one&quot; means one distinct root, then even if it&#x27;s a double root, that would still be considered one real root. But in standard terminology, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, they usually mean one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. However, in the case of k = M, we have three real roots but one is a double root. The problem&#x27;s option (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, so distinctness is important there. So, for (a), if there exists a k where f(x) = k has exactly one real root (distinct or not?), the answer depends on that.

But in the case where k is less than m₁, we have two distinct real roots. If k is equal to m₁, we have two real roots (x₁ is a double root, and another one). If k is between m₁ and m₃, three real roots. If k is equal to m₃ or M, three real roots (with a double root). If k is between m₃ and M, four real roots. If k is greater than M, two real roots.

Wait, but in none of these cases do we have exactly one real root. Even when k is less than m₁, we have two real roots. When k equals m₁ or m₃ or M, we have two or three real roots but with multiplicities. So, there is no k for which f(x) = k has exactly one real root, right? Unless when the polynomial is tangent to the line y = k at one point and doesn&#x27;t cross it elsewhere, but given the shape of the quartic, which tends to +infty on both sides, if the horizontal line is tangent at the local maximum or one of the minima, it will still cross the graph on one side or the other. Wait, for example, if k is equal to the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = M has a double root at x₂ and two other roots on the left and right. Wait, no. Wait, at k = M, the horizontal line touches the local maximum at x₂. To the left of x₂, the function is increasing from m₁ to M, so it only reaches M at x₂. To the right of x₂, the function decreases from M to m₃ and then increases again. Therefore, the line y = M would intersect the graph only at x₂ (a double root) and on the right side as the function increases past M again? Wait, no. Wait, after x₃, the function increases from m₃ to +infty. If M is the local maximum, then m₃ is less than M. So, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is less than M) up to +infty, so it must cross y = M once after x₃. Similarly, to the left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁ (which is less than M), so it must cross y = M once before x₁. Therefore, when k = M, the equation f(x) = M has three real roots: one at x₂ (double root) and one on each side. Therefore, three distinct real roots? Wait, but x₂ is a double root, so in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s three: x₂, and one on each side. So multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect distinctness. Therefore, even though x₂ is a double root, it&#x27;s still one distinct root. So in that case, k = M gives three distinct real roots, with one of them being a double root. Wait, no. If a root is a double root, it&#x27;s still a single distinct root; the distinctness refers to the x-values. So x₂ is one distinct root, and the other two are also distinct. So in total, three distinct real roots, one with multiplicity two. Therefore, for the problem&#x27;s option (b): &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Well, when k = M or k = m₁ or k = m₃, you have three real roots, but with one double root. But the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would require all three roots to be distinct, i.e., no multiple roots. So in that case, even though at k = M you have three real roots, one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. Therefore, the answer would be that statement (b) is false. Wait, but when k is between m₃ and M, we have four distinct real roots. When k is between m₁ and m₃, three distinct real roots. When k is less than m₁ or greater than M, two distinct real roots. When k equals M, m₁, or m₃, three real roots with one double root.

Therefore, the statement (b) says: &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Given that when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three distinct real roots (as per the earlier analysis). Wait, earlier I thought when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three real roots. Wait, let&#x27;s recheck.

Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two local minima, then depending on the graph, how does the horizontal line intersect? Suppose m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum, with m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, k between m₁ and m₃ would be above m₁ and below m₃. Then, on the left side (x &lt; x₁), the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is below k, so it crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is above k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross. Therefore, three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots because they are in different intervals. Therefore, statement (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima, we get three distinct real roots. Additionally, if m₁ &gt; m₃, then similar logic applies, just switch left and right.

Therefore, regardless of the relative positions of the minima, there exists a k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Therefore, option (b) is true.

But wait, the answer options are (a), (b), (c), (d). Let&#x27;s check the options again:

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

From the analysis above:

- (a) is false because for any real k, f(x) = k has either two, three, or four real roots. There is no k where it has exactly one real root.

- (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima (or between the higher local minimum and the local maximum, but actually in our case, between m₁ and m₃, assuming m₁ &lt; m₃), the equation f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

Wait, earlier, when k is between m₁ and m₃, which are both minima, the horizontal line y = k intersects the graph three times: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots.

- (c) is false because when k is greater than M or less than m₁ (the lower of the two minima), f(x) = k has only two real roots.

- (d) is false because when k is between the two local minima or between a local minimum and the local maximum, f(x) = k has four or three real roots, respectively, so not always two real and two complex roots.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

But wait, the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, and the options are (a)-(d). The analysis above suggests that (b) is true. However, in the initial problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots. Wait, but in our analysis, we concluded that between the two local minima, we can get three real roots. But the key is that the quartic has three critical points: two minima and one maximum or two maxima and one minima, but in this case, with leading coefficient positive, it&#x27;s two minima and one maximum.

But let me verify with an example. Take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x + 1. Wait, maybe a simpler example. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 2x³ - 3x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 6x² - 6x. Let&#x27;s find the critical points.

Wait, maybe a better example is f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has three real roots: x = 0, x = sqrt(2), x = -sqrt(2). So the critical points are at x = -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). Then f(x) at these points: f(-sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(2))⁴ - 4*(sqrt(2))² = 4 - 8 = -4. f(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. f(sqrt(2)) = same as f(-sqrt(2)) = -4. So the local minima are at x = ±sqrt(2) with f(x) = -4, and the local maximum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0. So this is a symmetric quartic. Then, for k between -4 and 0, f(x) = k has four real roots. For k = 0, it has three real roots (double root at x = 0 and two at ±sqrt(something)). For k &lt; -4, two real roots. For k &gt; 0, two real roots. For k between the minima and the maximum (i.e., between -4 and 0), four real roots. For k exactly at -4, three real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). Wait, but in this case, the two minima are equal. So here, m₁ = m₃ = -4. Therefore, there is no interval between m₁ and m₃; they are the same. Therefore, in this symmetric case, when k is between -4 and 0, you get four real roots, but when k is exactly -4, you get two real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). However, the original problem states that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does: -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). So in this case, the two minima are equal. Therefore, if the two local minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are equal), so the three real roots case doesn&#x27;t occur. Wait, but the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; for f’(x). In this example, f’(x) has three distinct real roots. But in this case, the minima are equal, so between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, you get four real roots. But if the minima are not equal, then between them, you would have three real roots.

Therefore, the key is whether the two local minima can be at different heights. If f’(x) has three distinct real roots, but the function f(x) could still have two equal minima. Wait, but in the example above, even with symmetric critical points, the minima are equal. So perhaps, depending on the coefficients, the minima can be equal or not. Therefore, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether the minima are equal or not, only that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Therefore, in some cases, you might have equal minima, in others not. Therefore, the answer would depend on whether, regardless of the specific f(x) meeting the condition, statement (b) is always true.

But wait, in the example where minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are the same), so the three real roots case would not exist. However, in that case, when k is between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, which is the same as saying between m and M, you get four real roots. When k is less than m or greater than M, you get two real roots. When k equals m, you get two double roots. When k equals M, you get three real roots (a double root and two simple roots). Therefore, in the symmetric case, statement (b) is false because there is no k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. When k = M, you have three real roots but one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. When k is between m and M, you have four distinct real roots. When k is less than m, two distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric case, statement (b) is false. But the problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does, but the minima are equal. Therefore, the correct answer would not always be (b). Therefore, my previous analysis was incorrect.

Therefore, there&#x27;s a problem: if the quartic is symmetric, with two equal minima, then there is no k for which f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) would not hold in such cases. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot; given that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Since there exist such polynomials where statement (b) is false, but there also exist polynomials where statement (b) is true. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the statement must hold for all such polynomials or if there exists at least one. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, implying that the statement must be always true given the conditions.

Therefore, since there exists a polynomial where f’(x) has three distinct real roots but there&#x27;s no k with three distinct real roots (like the symmetric quartic example), statement (b) is not always true. Therefore, my previous conclusion was wrong.

Then, what is the correct answer? Let&#x27;s re-examine the options.

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

In the symmetric example, the only possible numbers of real roots are two (k &lt; m), four (m &lt; k &lt; M), three (k = m or k = M), or two (k &gt; M). So in this case, there is no k with exactly one real root. Therefore, statement (a) is false.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric example, when k = m or k = M, we have three real roots but with a double root, so they are not distinct. Therefore, in this case, there is no k with three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) is false.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

False, since for k &gt; M or k &lt; m, there are only two real roots.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

False, since for some k, there are four real roots.

Therefore, in this case, none of the options are true? But that can&#x27;t be, because the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the symmetric example. Let&#x27;s take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has roots at x = 0, sqrt(2), -sqrt(2). So three distinct real roots. The function f(x) = x⁴ - 4x² has local maxima at x = 0 (f(0) = 0) and local minima at x = ±sqrt(2) (f(±sqrt(2)) = -4). Then, for k = -4, the equation f(x) = -4 has double roots at x = ±sqrt(2). For k = 0, it has a double root at x = 0 and simple roots at x = ±2. So, in this case, when k = 0, the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. Therefore, three real roots, but only two distinct ones (x = 0 and x = ±2). Wait, no. If x = ±2 are roots, then total roots are x = 0 (double), x = 2, and x = -2. So four roots total, but with x = 0 counted twice. However, the equation x⁴ - 4x² = 0 factors as x²(x² - 4) = 0, so roots at x = 0 (multiplicity 2), x = 2, x = -2. So in this case, for k = 0, there are three distinct real roots (0, 2, -2), with one of them being a double root. Therefore, in terms of distinct real roots, it&#x27;s three. So, statement (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would be true here because even though 0 is a double root, the roots are still distinct: -2, 0, 2. So in this case, k = 0 gives three distinct real roots, even with a double root at 0. Therefore, perhaps in this example, statement (b) is true.

Wait, but if we take k = -4, then f(x) = -4 has roots at x = ±sqrt(2), each with multiplicity two. So, two distinct real roots, each a double root. Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is not satisfied for k = -4, but for k = 0, we have three distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric example, there does exist a k (specifically k = 0) such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) is true.

But earlier, I thought that when the minima are equal, there&#x27;s no k between them, but in reality, even in the symmetric case, there is a k (the local maximum) where you have three distinct real roots. So regardless of whether the minima are equal or not, the local maximum will always provide a k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Let me check.

In the symmetric example, at k = 0 (the local maximum), the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double root) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) holds.

If we take another example where the minima are not equal. Let’s construct a quartic with two unequal minima. For example, f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x. Compute its derivative: f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x² + 4x + 4. I need to check if this derivative has three distinct real roots. Instead of computing, maybe take a known quartic. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 6x² + 4x. Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x + 4. Let&#x27;s check the roots of f’(x). Maybe this cubic has three real roots. Alternatively, use f(x) = x⁴ - 3x³ - 3x² + 4x + 1. Not sure. Alternatively, take f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4), but that would have four real roots, but its derivative would have three critical points. However, expanding this would be time-consuming.

Alternatively, take a quartic with two minima at different heights. Suppose f(x) has a local minimum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0, a local maximum at x = 1 with f(1) = 2, and another local minimum at x = 2 with f(2) = 1. Then, the function would go from +infty down to 0 at x = 0, up to 2 at x = 1, down to 1 at x = 2, and back up to +infty. In this case, m₁ = 0, M = 2, m₃ = 1. Then, for k between m₁ = 0 and m₃ = 1, the equation f(x) = k would have three distinct real roots: one left of 0, one between 0 and 1, and one between 1 and 2. For k between m₃ = 1 and M = 2, four distinct real roots. For k = 1, three real roots (double root at x = 2 and two others). For k = 0, three real roots (double root at x = 0 and one other). For k = 2, three real roots (double root at x = 1 and two others). For k &lt; 0, two real roots; for k &gt; 2, two real roots.

Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k between 0 and 1 (the two minima) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric case, even though the minima are equal, there&#x27;s still a k = M where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots (with a double root at the local maximum). Wait, no. In the symmetric case, k = M is the local maximum. For example, in f(x) = x⁴ - 4x², the local maximum is at x = 0 with k = 0. The equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, even in the symmetric case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k (specifically k = M) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Even though one of them is a double root, but the roots are still distinct in terms of their x-values. Wait, no. A double root at x = 0 means that x = 0 is a repeated root, but the distinct roots are x = -2, x = 0, x = 2. Therefore, three distinct real roots. The multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect the distinctness. Therefore, even if there is a multiple root, as long as there are three separate x-values, it&#x27;s three distinct real roots. Therefore, in both symmetric and asymmetric cases, statement (b) holds.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) with real coefficients, we know that its derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) has three distinct real roots. This implies that \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum (since the leading coefficient is positive, the polynomial tends to \( +\infty \) as \( x \to \pm\infty \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Critical Points and Graph Shape**:
   - The polynomial \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum.
   - The graph of \( f(x) \) will have a &quot;W&quot; shape with two local minima and one local maximum.

2. **Behavior of \( f(x) = k \)**:
   - For \( k \) values greater than the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local maximum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the local maximum and the higher local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has four real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to either local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local minimum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the two local minima, \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - For \( k \) values less than the lower local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.

3. **Evaluation of Statements**:
   - **(a)** False: There is no \( k \) such that \( f(x) = k \) has exactly one real root.
   - **(b)** True: There exists a \( k \) (between the two local minima) where \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - **(c)** False: \( f(x) = k \) does not always have four distinct real roots (e.g., for \( k \) outside the range between the local minima and maximum).
   - **(d)** False: \( f(x) = k \) can have four real roots for some \( k \), so it does not always have two real and two complex roots.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out which of the statements (a), (b), (c), or (d) is true given that the polynomial f(x) = x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d has a derivative f’(x) with three distinct real roots. Let me start by recalling some calculus and polynomial theory.

First, since f(x) is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, its derivative f’(x) is a cubic (degree 3) polynomial. The problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. That means the derivative has three distinct critical points where the slope of f(x) is zero. For a cubic polynomial to have three distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive, but I might not need to compute that here. The key takeaway is that the original function f(x) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum, or two local maxima and one local minimum. Since the derivative is a cubic with three real roots, it must alternate between increasing and decreasing appropriately.

Now, the graph of a quartic polynomial typically has a &quot;W&quot; shape or an &quot;M&quot; shape depending on the leading coefficient. Since the leading term here is x⁴, which has a positive coefficient, as x approaches positive or negative infinity, f(x) tends to positive infinity. Therefore, the graph will eventually rise on both ends. Given that the derivative has three real roots, there are three critical points. For a quartic with positive leading coefficient, the typical shape with three critical points would be two local minima and one local maximum in between. So, the graph would go up, then down, then up, then down, then up again? Wait, no. Wait, the derivative is cubic, so it can have three critical points. So the original function f(x) will have three turning points. Since it&#x27;s a quartic, it can have up to three turning points (since the derivative is cubic, which can have up to three roots). So with three critical points, the graph of f(x) will have two local minima and one local maximum, or two maxima and one minima. But given that the leading coefficient is positive, as x approaches ±∞, f(x) goes to +∞. Therefore, the rightmost and leftmost critical points must be minima. So the structure would be: starting from the left, the function decreases to a local maximum, then increases to a local minimum, then decreases again to a local maximum, and then increases to infinity? Wait, that doesn&#x27;t make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if the derivative has three real roots, then the original function f(x) has three critical points. Let me label them as x₁ &lt; x₂ &lt; x₃. Since the leading term is positive, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, and the same as x approaches -infty. So, the rightmost critical point x₃ must be a local minimum (since after that, the function increases to infinity), and the leftmost critical point x₁ must be a local maximum (since coming from -infty, the function is decreasing until x₁, then starts increasing). Wait, no, that seems contradictory. Let me check:

If x approaches -infty, f(x) tends to +infty, so as we move from left to right (from -infty to +infty), the function starts at +infty, then at some point x₁ (the leftmost critical point) it might turn. If x₁ is a local maximum, then after x₁, the function decreases. Then, at x₂, another critical point, which would have to be a local minimum, so after x₂, the function increases again. Then at x₃, another critical point, which would be a local maximum, and then after x₃, the function decreases. But wait, but after x₃, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, which is a contradiction because if x₃ is a local maximum, then after x₃, the function should decrease, but it actually needs to increase to +infty. Therefore, that can&#x27;t be. Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the leftmost critical point x₁ is a local minimum. Let&#x27;s see: starting from -infty, f(x) is going to +infty. Then at x₁, which is a local minimum, the function starts increasing. Then at x₂, a local maximum, so after x₂, the function decreases. Then at x₃, another local minimum, so after x₃, the function increases again towards +infty. That makes sense. So the critical points are arranged as local minimum at x₁, local maximum at x₂, local minimum at x₃. Therefore, the graph has two local minima and one local maximum.

So the function f(x) would start at +infty, decrease to a local minimum at x₁, then increase to a local maximum at x₂, then decrease to a local minimum at x₃, and then increase again to +infty. So, the graph would look like a &quot;W&quot; but with the middle peak being a local maximum and the two valleys being local minima. So, the function has two local minima and one local maximum.

Given that structure, let&#x27;s consider the possible number of real roots for f(x) = k. Depending on the value of k, the horizontal line y = k can intersect the graph of f(x) in different ways.

If k is greater than the value of the local maximum at x₂, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃, because the function only exceeds k on the far left and far right.

If k is exactly equal to the value of the local maximum at x₂, then f(x) = k would have three real roots: one at x₂ (with multiplicity two, since it&#x27;s a local maximum) and one on each side (left of x₁ and right of x₃). But wait, if the local maximum is exactly at k, then the graph touches the line y = k at x₂, so that&#x27;s a double root, and crosses the line on either side. So three real roots, but one of them is a double root.

If k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two local minima, then suppose the local minima at x₁ and x₃ have values m₁ and m₃. Let&#x27;s assume that one of the minima is lower than the other. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, both minima must be below the local maximum. However, depending on the specific coefficients, one minimum could be lower than the other. Let&#x27;s say, without loss of generality, that m₁ &lt; m₃ (the left local minimum is lower than the right local minimum). Then, if k is between m₃ and the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots: two on the left side (between -infty and x₁, and between x₁ and x₂), and two on the right side (between x₂ and x₃, and between x₃ and +infty). Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two minima, say between M and m₃ (assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), then when k is in (m₃, M), the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. But actually, when you have two minima and one maximum, the graph goes from +infty to m₁ (local min), rises to M (local max), then falls to m₃ (local min), then rises again to +infty. So if k is between m₁ and M, then depending on where k is relative to m₃, the number of roots changes.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch a rough graph mentally. Starting from the left (x approaching -infty), f(x) is at +infty, decreases to m₁ at x₁ (local min), then increases to M at x₂ (local max), then decreases to m₃ at x₃ (local min), then increases back to +infty.

So, if k is greater than M, then the equation f(x) = k has two real roots: one on the far left and one on the far right.

If k is equal to M, then it has three real roots: one at x₂ (a double root) and one on each side.

If k is between m₃ and M, then it has four real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, one between x₂ and x₃, and one right of x₃.

If k is equal to m₃, then it has three real roots: one at x₃ (double root) and one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂.

If k is between m₁ and m₃, then it has two real roots: one left of x₁ and one right of x₃, because the horizontal line y = k only intersects the graph on the leftmost and rightmost ascending parts. Wait, but between x₁ and x₃, the function reaches a maximum at x₂, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, then the line y = k would cross the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. Wait, but if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the minima, but since m₁ is lower than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ to M, so it must cross y = k once there. Similarly, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then since m₃ is higher than m₁, and k is between m₁ and m₃, then on the interval x₂ to x₃, the function decreases from M to m₃, crossing y = k once. Similarly, on the interval x₃ to +infty, the function increases from m₃ to +infty, so y = k would cross once there. Similarly, on the interval -infty to x₁, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, crossing y = k once. Therefore, actually, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots. If k is equal to m₁, then it&#x27;s a double root at x₁ and another root on the right. Similarly, if k is equal to m₃, it&#x27;s a double root at x₃ and another root on the left. If k is less than m₁, since m₁ is the lower of the two minima, then the line y = k would intersect the graph only twice: once left of x₁ and once right of x₃. Wait, no. If k is less than m₁, which is the minimum, then the graph only reaches down to m₁, so y = k would not intersect the graph at all? Wait, no. Wait, as x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches +infty, and at x₁, it&#x27;s a local minimum m₁. So if k &lt; m₁, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃? Wait, but if k is less than m₁, which is the minimum value on the left side, then on the left side, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, so it must cross y = k once. On the right side, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is higher than m₁) up to +infty, so if k is less than m₁, then since m₃ is greater than m₁, and k is less than m₁, then on the right side, the function starts at m₃ (which is greater than k) and increases to infinity, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, if k &lt; m₁, there is only one real root on the left side. Similarly, if k &gt; M, there are two real roots on the extremes. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to tabulate the different cases.

Let me denote:

- The leftmost local minimum at x = x₁ with f(x₁) = m₁.

- The local maximum at x = x₂ with f(x₂) = M.

- The rightmost local minimum at x = x₃ with f(x₃) = m₃.

Assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ (since x₁ &lt; x₃ and the function might have asymmetrical minima), though it could also be m₃ &lt; m₁. Wait, but since the function is going from m₁ up to M, then down to m₃, and then up again. The relative positions of m₁ and m₃ depend on the specific coefficients. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify, so I can&#x27;t assume which is lower. Therefore, perhaps I need to consider both possibilities. But maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter. Let&#x27;s suppose m₁ ≤ m₃ for definiteness. Then:

- If k &gt; M: two real roots (left and right).

- If k = M: three real roots (one double root at x₂ and two simple roots on the sides).

- If m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots (left, between x₁ and x₂, between x₂ and x₃, right).

- If k = m₃: three real roots (double root at x₃ and two others).

- If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: four real roots (similar to above? Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, but the function between x₁ and x₂ goes up to M, which is higher than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function crosses y = k once (since it goes from m₁ to M), between x₂ and x₃, it crosses once (since it goes from M to m₃), and on both ends, left of x₁ and right of x₃, the function is above k? Wait, no. Wait, the left end (x approaching -infty) is +infty, so coming from the left, the function starts at +infty, decreases to m₁ (which is less than k, since k &gt; m₁), so it must cross y = k once on the left side (before x₁). Then, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross there. Wait, but m₃ is greater than k, so after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so if m₃ &gt; k, then it never crosses y = k again. Therefore, in this case, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k has three real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, and one between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought.

Wait, perhaps I need to more carefully analyze:

Case 1: k &gt; M. Then, the horizontal line y = k cuts the graph at two points: one far left (before x₁) and one far right (after x₃).

Case 2: k = M. The line touches the local maximum at x₂ and cuts the graph on the left and right sides, resulting in three real roots (one double root at x₂).

Case 3: m₃ &lt; k &lt; M. The line y = k intersects the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃.

Wait, but if m₃ is the right local minimum, and k is greater than m₃ but less than M, then after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so since k &gt; m₃, there will be a crossing right of x₃. Similarly, left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is less than k (since k &gt; m₃ and m₃ &gt; m₁, so k &gt; m₁). Therefore, left of x₁, the function crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ (which is less than k) up to M (which is greater than k), so crosses once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is less than k), so crosses once. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to infinity, crossing once. Therefore, four crossings. So that&#x27;s four real roots.

Case 4: k = m₃. The line touches the local minimum at x₃, so it&#x27;s a double root there, and crosses the graph left of x₁ and between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so at k = m₃, it only touches at x₃. Therefore, the roots would be left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂ (since the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing k = m₃ if m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), but wait, m₃ is the value at x₃, which is a local minimum. If k = m₃, then between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so it reaches m₃ at x₃. Therefore, if k = m₃, then there&#x27;s a root at x₃ (double root) and another root left of x₁ (since the function decreases from +infty to m₁, which is less than m₃, so crosses y = m₃ once left of x₁) and another root between x₁ and x₂ (as the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing y = m₃ once). So total of three roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and a double root at x₃.

Case 5: m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃. Here, k is between the two local minima. Since m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum. Let&#x27;s assume m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph as follows:

- Left of x₁: the function comes down from +infty to m₁, which is less than k, so it crosses y = k once.

- Between x₁ and x₂: the function goes from m₁ (less than k) up to M (greater than k), so crosses once.

- Between x₂ and x₃: the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so crosses once.

- Right of x₃: the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = k there.

Therefore, total of three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃.

Wait, but hold on. If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃, then m₃ is greater than k, so right of x₃, the function starts at m₃ and goes up, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, only three real roots? But earlier, when k is between m₃ and M, we had four roots. Hmm.

Case 6: k = m₁. The line touches the left local minimum at x₁, resulting in a double root there. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than m₁), so if k = m₁, which is less than m₃, the function crosses y = k once between x₂ and x₃. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ to +infty, which is above k, so no crossing. Also, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M, so crosses y = k once. Wait, but if k = m₁, then between x₁ and x₂, the function starts at m₁ (k) and goes up, so the crossing is exactly at x₁, which is a double root. Then, another crossing between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, three real roots: double root at x₁ and single roots between x₂ and x₃ and right of x₃? Wait, no. Wait, if k = m₁, then at x₁, the function has a local minimum. So the graph touches y = k at x₁, and then goes up. On the left side, as x approaches -infty, the function approaches +infty, so it comes down from +infty to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, left of x₁, there&#x27;s no crossing since it&#x27;s decreasing to m₁. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root because it&#x27;s a local minimum). Then, moving from x₁ to x₂, the function increases to M, which is greater than m₁, so there&#x27;s no crossing there. Then, from x₂ to x₃, the function decreases to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Then, from x₃ to +infty, the function increases to +infty, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = m₁ again. Therefore, total of two real roots: a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but the original function at x approaching -infty is +infty, so when approaching from the left, the function decreases to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, for k = m₁, the leftmost intersection is exactly at x₁ (a double root), and then another intersection between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, two real roots (one double, one single). But in the context of the problem, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot; or &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, do they count multiplicity? The problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for option (a). If they count multiplicity, then at k = m₁, f(x) = k has two real roots (one double, one single). If they don&#x27;t count multiplicity, then maybe it&#x27;s considered as two real roots (but one is a double root). Wait, the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;. So if multiplicity is considered, then a double root would count as one root, but actually, in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s still one. Wait, no. Wait, multiplicity is about the number of roots counting multiplicity. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, which might mean exactly one distinct real root, or exactly one real root counting multiplicity. The question is ambiguous, but in standard terminology, &quot;exactly one real root&quot; usually refers to exactly one distinct real root, but in some contexts, it might count multiplicity. However, in options (b) and (c), they mention &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; and &quot;four distinct real roots&quot;, so it seems like they are distinguishing between distinct roots and multiple roots. Therefore, for (a), &quot;exactly one real root&quot; probably means exactly one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. Similarly, for (b), &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;. So in the case where k = m₁, we have a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃, so that&#x27;s two distinct real roots (x₁ with multiplicity two and another root). Therefore, (a) is not satisfied here.

Case 7: k &lt; m₁. Then, the horizontal line y = k is below both local minima. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, the line y = k would intersect the graph twice: once on the far left (before x₁) and once on the far right (after x₃). Therefore, two real roots.

So summarizing:

- k &gt; M: two real roots.

- k = M: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots.

- k = m₃: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: three real roots.

- k = m₁: three real roots (one double, two simple? Wait, earlier analysis said two roots, but maybe I messed up).

Wait, let me re-examine k = m₁. If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root) and since between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, total of two distinct real roots: x₁ (double) and one between x₂ and x₃. So, in terms of distinct roots, two; in terms of total roots counting multiplicity, three. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for (a). If &quot;exactly one&quot; means one distinct root, then even if it&#x27;s a double root, that would still be considered one real root. But in standard terminology, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, they usually mean one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. However, in the case of k = M, we have three real roots but one is a double root. The problem&#x27;s option (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, so distinctness is important there. So, for (a), if there exists a k where f(x) = k has exactly one real root (distinct or not?), the answer depends on that.

But in the case where k is less than m₁, we have two distinct real roots. If k is equal to m₁, we have two real roots (x₁ is a double root, and another one). If k is between m₁ and m₃, three real roots. If k is equal to m₃ or M, three real roots (with a double root). If k is between m₃ and M, four real roots. If k is greater than M, two real roots.

Wait, but in none of these cases do we have exactly one real root. Even when k is less than m₁, we have two real roots. When k equals m₁ or m₃ or M, we have two or three real roots but with multiplicities. So, there is no k for which f(x) = k has exactly one real root, right? Unless when the polynomial is tangent to the line y = k at one point and doesn&#x27;t cross it elsewhere, but given the shape of the quartic, which tends to +infty on both sides, if the horizontal line is tangent at the local maximum or one of the minima, it will still cross the graph on one side or the other. Wait, for example, if k is equal to the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = M has a double root at x₂ and two other roots on the left and right. Wait, no. Wait, at k = M, the horizontal line touches the local maximum at x₂. To the left of x₂, the function is increasing from m₁ to M, so it only reaches M at x₂. To the right of x₂, the function decreases from M to m₃ and then increases again. Therefore, the line y = M would intersect the graph only at x₂ (a double root) and on the right side as the function increases past M again? Wait, no. Wait, after x₃, the function increases from m₃ to +infty. If M is the local maximum, then m₃ is less than M. So, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is less than M) up to +infty, so it must cross y = M once after x₃. Similarly, to the left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁ (which is less than M), so it must cross y = M once before x₁. Therefore, when k = M, the equation f(x) = M has three real roots: one at x₂ (double root) and one on each side. Therefore, three distinct real roots? Wait, but x₂ is a double root, so in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s three: x₂, and one on each side. So multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect distinctness. Therefore, even though x₂ is a double root, it&#x27;s still one distinct root. So in that case, k = M gives three distinct real roots, with one of them being a double root. Wait, no. If a root is a double root, it&#x27;s still a single distinct root; the distinctness refers to the x-values. So x₂ is one distinct root, and the other two are also distinct. So in total, three distinct real roots, one with multiplicity two. Therefore, for the problem&#x27;s option (b): &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Well, when k = M or k = m₁ or k = m₃, you have three real roots, but with one double root. But the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would require all three roots to be distinct, i.e., no multiple roots. So in that case, even though at k = M you have three real roots, one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. Therefore, the answer would be that statement (b) is false. Wait, but when k is between m₃ and M, we have four distinct real roots. When k is between m₁ and m₃, three distinct real roots. When k is less than m₁ or greater than M, two distinct real roots. When k equals M, m₁, or m₃, three real roots with one double root.

Therefore, the statement (b) says: &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Given that when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three distinct real roots (as per the earlier analysis). Wait, earlier I thought when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three real roots. Wait, let&#x27;s recheck.

Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two local minima, then depending on the graph, how does the horizontal line intersect? Suppose m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum, with m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, k between m₁ and m₃ would be above m₁ and below m₃. Then, on the left side (x &lt; x₁), the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is below k, so it crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is above k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross. Therefore, three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots because they are in different intervals. Therefore, statement (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima, we get three distinct real roots. Additionally, if m₁ &gt; m₃, then similar logic applies, just switch left and right.

Therefore, regardless of the relative positions of the minima, there exists a k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Therefore, option (b) is true.

But wait, the answer options are (a), (b), (c), (d). Let&#x27;s check the options again:

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

From the analysis above:

- (a) is false because for any real k, f(x) = k has either two, three, or four real roots. There is no k where it has exactly one real root.

- (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima (or between the higher local minimum and the local maximum, but actually in our case, between m₁ and m₃, assuming m₁ &lt; m₃), the equation f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

Wait, earlier, when k is between m₁ and m₃, which are both minima, the horizontal line y = k intersects the graph three times: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots.

- (c) is false because when k is greater than M or less than m₁ (the lower of the two minima), f(x) = k has only two real roots.

- (d) is false because when k is between the two local minima or between a local minimum and the local maximum, f(x) = k has four or three real roots, respectively, so not always two real and two complex roots.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

But wait, the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, and the options are (a)-(d). The analysis above suggests that (b) is true. However, in the initial problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots. Wait, but in our analysis, we concluded that between the two local minima, we can get three real roots. But the key is that the quartic has three critical points: two minima and one maximum or two maxima and one minima, but in this case, with leading coefficient positive, it&#x27;s two minima and one maximum.

But let me verify with an example. Take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x + 1. Wait, maybe a simpler example. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 2x³ - 3x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 6x² - 6x. Let&#x27;s find the critical points.

Wait, maybe a better example is f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has three real roots: x = 0, x = sqrt(2), x = -sqrt(2). So the critical points are at x = -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). Then f(x) at these points: f(-sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(2))⁴ - 4*(sqrt(2))² = 4 - 8 = -4. f(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. f(sqrt(2)) = same as f(-sqrt(2)) = -4. So the local minima are at x = ±sqrt(2) with f(x) = -4, and the local maximum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0. So this is a symmetric quartic. Then, for k between -4 and 0, f(x) = k has four real roots. For k = 0, it has three real roots (double root at x = 0 and two at ±sqrt(something)). For k &lt; -4, two real roots. For k &gt; 0, two real roots. For k between the minima and the maximum (i.e., between -4 and 0), four real roots. For k exactly at -4, three real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). Wait, but in this case, the two minima are equal. So here, m₁ = m₃ = -4. Therefore, there is no interval between m₁ and m₃; they are the same. Therefore, in this symmetric case, when k is between -4 and 0, you get four real roots, but when k is exactly -4, you get two real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). However, the original problem states that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does: -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). So in this case, the two minima are equal. Therefore, if the two local minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are equal), so the three real roots case doesn&#x27;t occur. Wait, but the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; for f’(x). In this example, f’(x) has three distinct real roots. But in this case, the minima are equal, so between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, you get four real roots. But if the minima are not equal, then between them, you would have three real roots.

Therefore, the key is whether the two local minima can be at different heights. If f’(x) has three distinct real roots, but the function f(x) could still have two equal minima. Wait, but in the example above, even with symmetric critical points, the minima are equal. So perhaps, depending on the coefficients, the minima can be equal or not. Therefore, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether the minima are equal or not, only that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Therefore, in some cases, you might have equal minima, in others not. Therefore, the answer would depend on whether, regardless of the specific f(x) meeting the condition, statement (b) is always true.

But wait, in the example where minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are the same), so the three real roots case would not exist. However, in that case, when k is between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, which is the same as saying between m and M, you get four real roots. When k is less than m or greater than M, you get two real roots. When k equals m, you get two double roots. When k equals M, you get three real roots (a double root and two simple roots). Therefore, in the symmetric case, statement (b) is false because there is no k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. When k = M, you have three real roots but one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. When k is between m and M, you have four distinct real roots. When k is less than m, two distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric case, statement (b) is false. But the problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does, but the minima are equal. Therefore, the correct answer would not always be (b). Therefore, my previous analysis was incorrect.

Therefore, there&#x27;s a problem: if the quartic is symmetric, with two equal minima, then there is no k for which f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) would not hold in such cases. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot; given that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Since there exist such polynomials where statement (b) is false, but there also exist polynomials where statement (b) is true. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the statement must hold for all such polynomials or if there exists at least one. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, implying that the statement must be always true given the conditions.

Therefore, since there exists a polynomial where f’(x) has three distinct real roots but there&#x27;s no k with three distinct real roots (like the symmetric quartic example), statement (b) is not always true. Therefore, my previous conclusion was wrong.

Then, what is the correct answer? Let&#x27;s re-examine the options.

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

In the symmetric example, the only possible numbers of real roots are two (k &lt; m), four (m &lt; k &lt; M), three (k = m or k = M), or two (k &gt; M). So in this case, there is no k with exactly one real root. Therefore, statement (a) is false.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric example, when k = m or k = M, we have three real roots but with a double root, so they are not distinct. Therefore, in this case, there is no k with three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) is false.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

False, since for k &gt; M or k &lt; m, there are only two real roots.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

False, since for some k, there are four real roots.

Therefore, in this case, none of the options are true? But that can&#x27;t be, because the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the symmetric example. Let&#x27;s take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has roots at x = 0, sqrt(2), -sqrt(2). So three distinct real roots. The function f(x) = x⁴ - 4x² has local maxima at x = 0 (f(0) = 0) and local minima at x = ±sqrt(2) (f(±sqrt(2)) = -4). Then, for k = -4, the equation f(x) = -4 has double roots at x = ±sqrt(2). For k = 0, it has a double root at x = 0 and simple roots at x = ±2. So, in this case, when k = 0, the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. Therefore, three real roots, but only two distinct ones (x = 0 and x = ±2). Wait, no. If x = ±2 are roots, then total roots are x = 0 (double), x = 2, and x = -2. So four roots total, but with x = 0 counted twice. However, the equation x⁴ - 4x² = 0 factors as x²(x² - 4) = 0, so roots at x = 0 (multiplicity 2), x = 2, x = -2. So in this case, for k = 0, there are three distinct real roots (0, 2, -2), with one of them being a double root. Therefore, in terms of distinct real roots, it&#x27;s three. So, statement (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would be true here because even though 0 is a double root, the roots are still distinct: -2, 0, 2. So in this case, k = 0 gives three distinct real roots, even with a double root at 0. Therefore, perhaps in this example, statement (b) is true.

Wait, but if we take k = -4, then f(x) = -4 has roots at x = ±sqrt(2), each with multiplicity two. So, two distinct real roots, each a double root. Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is not satisfied for k = -4, but for k = 0, we have three distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric example, there does exist a k (specifically k = 0) such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) is true.

But earlier, I thought that when the minima are equal, there&#x27;s no k between them, but in reality, even in the symmetric case, there is a k (the local maximum) where you have three distinct real roots. So regardless of whether the minima are equal or not, the local maximum will always provide a k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Let me check.

In the symmetric example, at k = 0 (the local maximum), the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double root) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) holds.

If we take another example where the minima are not equal. Let’s construct a quartic with two unequal minima. For example, f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x. Compute its derivative: f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x² + 4x + 4. I need to check if this derivative has three distinct real roots. Instead of computing, maybe take a known quartic. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 6x² + 4x. Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x + 4. Let&#x27;s check the roots of f’(x). Maybe this cubic has three real roots. Alternatively, use f(x) = x⁴ - 3x³ - 3x² + 4x + 1. Not sure. Alternatively, take f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4), but that would have four real roots, but its derivative would have three critical points. However, expanding this would be time-consuming.

Alternatively, take a quartic with two minima at different heights. Suppose f(x) has a local minimum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0, a local maximum at x = 1 with f(1) = 2, and another local minimum at x = 2 with f(2) = 1. Then, the function would go from +infty down to 0 at x = 0, up to 2 at x = 1, down to 1 at x = 2, and back up to +infty. In this case, m₁ = 0, M = 2, m₃ = 1. Then, for k between m₁ = 0 and m₃ = 1, the equation f(x) = k would have three distinct real roots: one left of 0, one between 0 and 1, and one between 1 and 2. For k between m₃ = 1 and M = 2, four distinct real roots. For k = 1, three real roots (double root at x = 2 and two others). For k = 0, three real roots (double root at x = 0 and one other). For k = 2, three real roots (double root at x = 1 and two others). For k &lt; 0, two real roots; for k &gt; 2, two real roots.

Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k between 0 and 1 (the two minima) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric case, even though the minima are equal, there&#x27;s still a k = M where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots (with a double root at the local maximum). Wait, no. In the symmetric case, k = M is the local maximum. For example, in f(x) = x⁴ - 4x², the local maximum is at x = 0 with k = 0. The equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, even in the symmetric case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k (specifically k = M) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Even though one of them is a double root, but the roots are still distinct in terms of their x-values. Wait, no. A double root at x = 0 means that x = 0 is a repeated root, but the distinct roots are x = -2, x = 0, x = 2. Therefore, three distinct real roots. The multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect the distinctness. Therefore, even if there is a multiple root, as long as there are three separate x-values, it&#x27;s three distinct real roots. Therefore, in both symmetric and asymmetric cases, statement (b) holds.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) with real coefficients, we know that its derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) has three distinct real roots. This implies that \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum (since the leading coefficient is positive, the polynomial tends to \( +\infty \) as \( x \to \pm\infty \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Critical Points and Graph Shape**:
   - The polynomial \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum.
   - The graph of \( f(x) \) will have a &quot;W&quot; shape with two local minima and one local maximum.

2. **Behavior of \( f(x) = k \)**:
   - For \( k \) values greater than the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local maximum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the local maximum and the higher local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has four real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to either local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local minimum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the two local minima, \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - For \( k \) values less than the lower local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.

3. **Evaluation of Statements**:
   - **(a)** False: There is no \( k \) such that \( f(x) = k \) has exactly one real root.
   - **(b)** True: There exists a \( k \) (between the two local minima) where \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - **(c)** False: \( f(x) = k \) does not always have four distinct real roots (e.g., for \( k \) outside the range between the local minima and maximum).
   - **(d)** False: \( f(x) = k \) can have four real roots for some \( k \), so it does not always have two real and two complex roots.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out which of the statements (a), (b), (c), or (d) is true given that the polynomial f(x) = x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d has a derivative f’(x) with three distinct real roots. Let me start by recalling some calculus and polynomial theory.

First, since f(x) is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial, its derivative f’(x) is a cubic (degree 3) polynomial. The problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. That means the derivative has three distinct critical points where the slope of f(x) is zero. For a cubic polynomial to have three distinct real roots, its discriminant must be positive, but I might not need to compute that here. The key takeaway is that the original function f(x) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum, or two local maxima and one local minimum. Since the derivative is a cubic with three real roots, it must alternate between increasing and decreasing appropriately.

Now, the graph of a quartic polynomial typically has a &quot;W&quot; shape or an &quot;M&quot; shape depending on the leading coefficient. Since the leading term here is x⁴, which has a positive coefficient, as x approaches positive or negative infinity, f(x) tends to positive infinity. Therefore, the graph will eventually rise on both ends. Given that the derivative has three real roots, there are three critical points. For a quartic with positive leading coefficient, the typical shape with three critical points would be two local minima and one local maximum in between. So, the graph would go up, then down, then up, then down, then up again? Wait, no. Wait, the derivative is cubic, so it can have three critical points. So the original function f(x) will have three turning points. Since it&#x27;s a quartic, it can have up to three turning points (since the derivative is cubic, which can have up to three roots). So with three critical points, the graph of f(x) will have two local minima and one local maximum, or two maxima and one minima. But given that the leading coefficient is positive, as x approaches ±∞, f(x) goes to +∞. Therefore, the rightmost and leftmost critical points must be minima. So the structure would be: starting from the left, the function decreases to a local maximum, then increases to a local minimum, then decreases again to a local maximum, and then increases to infinity? Wait, that doesn&#x27;t make sense. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if the derivative has three real roots, then the original function f(x) has three critical points. Let me label them as x₁ &lt; x₂ &lt; x₃. Since the leading term is positive, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, and the same as x approaches -infty. So, the rightmost critical point x₃ must be a local minimum (since after that, the function increases to infinity), and the leftmost critical point x₁ must be a local maximum (since coming from -infty, the function is decreasing until x₁, then starts increasing). Wait, no, that seems contradictory. Let me check:

If x approaches -infty, f(x) tends to +infty, so as we move from left to right (from -infty to +infty), the function starts at +infty, then at some point x₁ (the leftmost critical point) it might turn. If x₁ is a local maximum, then after x₁, the function decreases. Then, at x₂, another critical point, which would have to be a local minimum, so after x₂, the function increases again. Then at x₃, another critical point, which would be a local maximum, and then after x₃, the function decreases. But wait, but after x₃, as x approaches +infty, f(x) tends to +infty, which is a contradiction because if x₃ is a local maximum, then after x₃, the function should decrease, but it actually needs to increase to +infty. Therefore, that can&#x27;t be. Therefore, my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the leftmost critical point x₁ is a local minimum. Let&#x27;s see: starting from -infty, f(x) is going to +infty. Then at x₁, which is a local minimum, the function starts increasing. Then at x₂, a local maximum, so after x₂, the function decreases. Then at x₃, another local minimum, so after x₃, the function increases again towards +infty. That makes sense. So the critical points are arranged as local minimum at x₁, local maximum at x₂, local minimum at x₃. Therefore, the graph has two local minima and one local maximum.

So the function f(x) would start at +infty, decrease to a local minimum at x₁, then increase to a local maximum at x₂, then decrease to a local minimum at x₃, and then increase again to +infty. So, the graph would look like a &quot;W&quot; but with the middle peak being a local maximum and the two valleys being local minima. So, the function has two local minima and one local maximum.

Given that structure, let&#x27;s consider the possible number of real roots for f(x) = k. Depending on the value of k, the horizontal line y = k can intersect the graph of f(x) in different ways.

If k is greater than the value of the local maximum at x₂, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃, because the function only exceeds k on the far left and far right.

If k is exactly equal to the value of the local maximum at x₂, then f(x) = k would have three real roots: one at x₂ (with multiplicity two, since it&#x27;s a local maximum) and one on each side (left of x₁ and right of x₃). But wait, if the local maximum is exactly at k, then the graph touches the line y = k at x₂, so that&#x27;s a double root, and crosses the line on either side. So three real roots, but one of them is a double root.

If k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two local minima, then suppose the local minima at x₁ and x₃ have values m₁ and m₃. Let&#x27;s assume that one of the minima is lower than the other. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, both minima must be below the local maximum. However, depending on the specific coefficients, one minimum could be lower than the other. Let&#x27;s say, without loss of generality, that m₁ &lt; m₃ (the left local minimum is lower than the right local minimum). Then, if k is between m₃ and the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots: two on the left side (between -infty and x₁, and between x₁ and x₂), and two on the right side (between x₂ and x₃, and between x₃ and +infty). Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.

Wait, if k is between the local maximum and the higher of the two minima, say between M and m₃ (assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), then when k is in (m₃, M), the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. But actually, when you have two minima and one maximum, the graph goes from +infty to m₁ (local min), rises to M (local max), then falls to m₃ (local min), then rises again to +infty. So if k is between m₁ and M, then depending on where k is relative to m₃, the number of roots changes.

Wait, perhaps I should sketch a rough graph mentally. Starting from the left (x approaching -infty), f(x) is at +infty, decreases to m₁ at x₁ (local min), then increases to M at x₂ (local max), then decreases to m₃ at x₃ (local min), then increases back to +infty.

So, if k is greater than M, then the equation f(x) = k has two real roots: one on the far left and one on the far right.

If k is equal to M, then it has three real roots: one at x₂ (a double root) and one on each side.

If k is between m₃ and M, then it has four real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, one between x₂ and x₃, and one right of x₃.

If k is equal to m₃, then it has three real roots: one at x₃ (double root) and one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂.

If k is between m₁ and m₃, then it has two real roots: one left of x₁ and one right of x₃, because the horizontal line y = k only intersects the graph on the leftmost and rightmost ascending parts. Wait, but between x₁ and x₃, the function reaches a maximum at x₂, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, then the line y = k would cross the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃. Wait, but if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the minima, but since m₁ is lower than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ to M, so it must cross y = k once there. Similarly, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then since m₃ is higher than m₁, and k is between m₁ and m₃, then on the interval x₂ to x₃, the function decreases from M to m₃, crossing y = k once. Similarly, on the interval x₃ to +infty, the function increases from m₃ to +infty, so y = k would cross once there. Similarly, on the interval -infty to x₁, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, crossing y = k once. Therefore, actually, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k would have four real roots. If k is equal to m₁, then it&#x27;s a double root at x₁ and another root on the right. Similarly, if k is equal to m₃, it&#x27;s a double root at x₃ and another root on the left. If k is less than m₁, since m₁ is the lower of the two minima, then the line y = k would intersect the graph only twice: once left of x₁ and once right of x₃. Wait, no. If k is less than m₁, which is the minimum, then the graph only reaches down to m₁, so y = k would not intersect the graph at all? Wait, no. Wait, as x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches +infty, and at x₁, it&#x27;s a local minimum m₁. So if k &lt; m₁, then the equation f(x) = k would have two real roots: one to the left of x₁ and one to the right of x₃? Wait, but if k is less than m₁, which is the minimum value on the left side, then on the left side, the function goes from +infty down to m₁, so it must cross y = k once. On the right side, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is higher than m₁) up to +infty, so if k is less than m₁, then since m₃ is greater than m₁, and k is less than m₁, then on the right side, the function starts at m₃ (which is greater than k) and increases to infinity, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, if k &lt; m₁, there is only one real root on the left side. Similarly, if k &gt; M, there are two real roots on the extremes. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to tabulate the different cases.

Let me denote:

- The leftmost local minimum at x = x₁ with f(x₁) = m₁.

- The local maximum at x = x₂ with f(x₂) = M.

- The rightmost local minimum at x = x₃ with f(x₃) = m₃.

Assuming m₁ &lt; m₃ (since x₁ &lt; x₃ and the function might have asymmetrical minima), though it could also be m₃ &lt; m₁. Wait, but since the function is going from m₁ up to M, then down to m₃, and then up again. The relative positions of m₁ and m₃ depend on the specific coefficients. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify, so I can&#x27;t assume which is lower. Therefore, perhaps I need to consider both possibilities. But maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter. Let&#x27;s suppose m₁ ≤ m₃ for definiteness. Then:

- If k &gt; M: two real roots (left and right).

- If k = M: three real roots (one double root at x₂ and two simple roots on the sides).

- If m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots (left, between x₁ and x₂, between x₂ and x₃, right).

- If k = m₃: three real roots (double root at x₃ and two others).

- If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: four real roots (similar to above? Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two minima, but the function between x₁ and x₂ goes up to M, which is higher than m₃, so if k is between m₁ and m₃, then between x₁ and x₂, the function crosses y = k once (since it goes from m₁ to M), between x₂ and x₃, it crosses once (since it goes from M to m₃), and on both ends, left of x₁ and right of x₃, the function is above k? Wait, no. Wait, the left end (x approaching -infty) is +infty, so coming from the left, the function starts at +infty, decreases to m₁ (which is less than k, since k &gt; m₁), so it must cross y = k once on the left side (before x₁). Then, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross there. Wait, but m₃ is greater than k, so after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so if m₃ &gt; k, then it never crosses y = k again. Therefore, in this case, when k is between m₁ and m₃, the equation f(x) = k has three real roots: one left of x₁, one between x₁ and x₂, and one between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought.

Wait, perhaps I need to more carefully analyze:

Case 1: k &gt; M. Then, the horizontal line y = k cuts the graph at two points: one far left (before x₁) and one far right (after x₃).

Case 2: k = M. The line touches the local maximum at x₂ and cuts the graph on the left and right sides, resulting in three real roots (one double root at x₂).

Case 3: m₃ &lt; k &lt; M. The line y = k intersects the graph four times: once left of x₁, once between x₁ and x₂, once between x₂ and x₃, and once right of x₃.

Wait, but if m₃ is the right local minimum, and k is greater than m₃ but less than M, then after x₃, the function is increasing from m₃ to infinity, so since k &gt; m₃, there will be a crossing right of x₃. Similarly, left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is less than k (since k &gt; m₃ and m₃ &gt; m₁, so k &gt; m₁). Therefore, left of x₁, the function crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ (which is less than k) up to M (which is greater than k), so crosses once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is less than k), so crosses once. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to infinity, crossing once. Therefore, four crossings. So that&#x27;s four real roots.

Case 4: k = m₃. The line touches the local minimum at x₃, so it&#x27;s a double root there, and crosses the graph left of x₁ and between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so at k = m₃, it only touches at x₃. Therefore, the roots would be left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂ (since the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing k = m₃ if m₁ &lt; m₃ &lt; M), but wait, m₃ is the value at x₃, which is a local minimum. If k = m₃, then between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, so it reaches m₃ at x₃. Therefore, if k = m₃, then there&#x27;s a root at x₃ (double root) and another root left of x₁ (since the function decreases from +infty to m₁, which is less than m₃, so crosses y = m₃ once left of x₁) and another root between x₁ and x₂ (as the function goes from m₁ up to M, crossing y = m₃ once). So total of three roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and a double root at x₃.

Case 5: m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃. Here, k is between the two local minima. Since m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum. Let&#x27;s assume m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, the horizontal line y = k would intersect the graph as follows:

- Left of x₁: the function comes down from +infty to m₁, which is less than k, so it crosses y = k once.

- Between x₁ and x₂: the function goes from m₁ (less than k) up to M (greater than k), so crosses once.

- Between x₂ and x₃: the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than k), so crosses once.

- Right of x₃: the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is greater than k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = k there.

Therefore, total of three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃.

Wait, but hold on. If m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃, then m₃ is greater than k, so right of x₃, the function starts at m₃ and goes up, so it never crosses y = k. Therefore, only three real roots? But earlier, when k is between m₃ and M, we had four roots. Hmm.

Case 6: k = m₁. The line touches the left local minimum at x₁, resulting in a double root there. Then, between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is greater than m₁), so if k = m₁, which is less than m₃, the function crosses y = k once between x₂ and x₃. Then, right of x₃, the function goes from m₃ to +infty, which is above k, so no crossing. Also, between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M, so crosses y = k once. Wait, but if k = m₁, then between x₁ and x₂, the function starts at m₁ (k) and goes up, so the crossing is exactly at x₁, which is a double root. Then, another crossing between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, three real roots: double root at x₁ and single roots between x₂ and x₃ and right of x₃? Wait, no. Wait, if k = m₁, then at x₁, the function has a local minimum. So the graph touches y = k at x₁, and then goes up. On the left side, as x approaches -infty, the function approaches +infty, so it comes down from +infty to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, left of x₁, there&#x27;s no crossing since it&#x27;s decreasing to m₁. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root because it&#x27;s a local minimum). Then, moving from x₁ to x₂, the function increases to M, which is greater than m₁, so there&#x27;s no crossing there. Then, from x₂ to x₃, the function decreases to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Then, from x₃ to +infty, the function increases to +infty, so it doesn&#x27;t cross y = m₁ again. Therefore, total of two real roots: a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃. Wait, but the original function at x approaching -infty is +infty, so when approaching from the left, the function decreases to m₁ at x₁. Therefore, for k = m₁, the leftmost intersection is exactly at x₁ (a double root), and then another intersection between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, two real roots (one double, one single). But in the context of the problem, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot; or &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, do they count multiplicity? The problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for option (a). If they count multiplicity, then at k = m₁, f(x) = k has two real roots (one double, one single). If they don&#x27;t count multiplicity, then maybe it&#x27;s considered as two real roots (but one is a double root). Wait, the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;. So if multiplicity is considered, then a double root would count as one root, but actually, in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s still one. Wait, no. Wait, multiplicity is about the number of roots counting multiplicity. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, which might mean exactly one distinct real root, or exactly one real root counting multiplicity. The question is ambiguous, but in standard terminology, &quot;exactly one real root&quot; usually refers to exactly one distinct real root, but in some contexts, it might count multiplicity. However, in options (b) and (c), they mention &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; and &quot;four distinct real roots&quot;, so it seems like they are distinguishing between distinct roots and multiple roots. Therefore, for (a), &quot;exactly one real root&quot; probably means exactly one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. Similarly, for (b), &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;. So in the case where k = m₁, we have a double root at x₁ and a single root between x₂ and x₃, so that&#x27;s two distinct real roots (x₁ with multiplicity two and another root). Therefore, (a) is not satisfied here.

Case 7: k &lt; m₁. Then, the horizontal line y = k is below both local minima. Since the function tends to +infty on both ends, the line y = k would intersect the graph twice: once on the far left (before x₁) and once on the far right (after x₃). Therefore, two real roots.

So summarizing:

- k &gt; M: two real roots.

- k = M: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₃ &lt; k &lt; M: four real roots.

- k = m₃: three real roots (one double, two simple).

- m₁ &lt; k &lt; m₃: three real roots.

- k = m₁: three real roots (one double, two simple? Wait, earlier analysis said two roots, but maybe I messed up).

Wait, let me re-examine k = m₁. If k = m₁, then the equation f(x) = m₁ has a root at x₁ (double root) and since between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃, which is greater than m₁, so it crosses y = m₁ once between x₂ and x₃. Therefore, total of two distinct real roots: x₁ (double) and one between x₂ and x₃. So, in terms of distinct roots, two; in terms of total roots counting multiplicity, three. But the problem says &quot;exactly one real root&quot; for (a). If &quot;exactly one&quot; means one distinct root, then even if it&#x27;s a double root, that would still be considered one real root. But in standard terminology, when they say &quot;exactly one real root&quot;, they usually mean one distinct real root, regardless of multiplicity. However, in the case of k = M, we have three real roots but one is a double root. The problem&#x27;s option (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, so distinctness is important there. So, for (a), if there exists a k where f(x) = k has exactly one real root (distinct or not?), the answer depends on that.

But in the case where k is less than m₁, we have two distinct real roots. If k is equal to m₁, we have two real roots (x₁ is a double root, and another one). If k is between m₁ and m₃, three real roots. If k is equal to m₃ or M, three real roots (with a double root). If k is between m₃ and M, four real roots. If k is greater than M, two real roots.

Wait, but in none of these cases do we have exactly one real root. Even when k is less than m₁, we have two real roots. When k equals m₁ or m₃ or M, we have two or three real roots but with multiplicities. So, there is no k for which f(x) = k has exactly one real root, right? Unless when the polynomial is tangent to the line y = k at one point and doesn&#x27;t cross it elsewhere, but given the shape of the quartic, which tends to +infty on both sides, if the horizontal line is tangent at the local maximum or one of the minima, it will still cross the graph on one side or the other. Wait, for example, if k is equal to the local maximum M, then the equation f(x) = M has a double root at x₂ and two other roots on the left and right. Wait, no. Wait, at k = M, the horizontal line touches the local maximum at x₂. To the left of x₂, the function is increasing from m₁ to M, so it only reaches M at x₂. To the right of x₂, the function decreases from M to m₃ and then increases again. Therefore, the line y = M would intersect the graph only at x₂ (a double root) and on the right side as the function increases past M again? Wait, no. Wait, after x₃, the function increases from m₃ to +infty. If M is the local maximum, then m₃ is less than M. So, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ (which is less than M) up to +infty, so it must cross y = M once after x₃. Similarly, to the left of x₁, the function comes from +infty down to m₁ (which is less than M), so it must cross y = M once before x₁. Therefore, when k = M, the equation f(x) = M has three real roots: one at x₂ (double root) and one on each side. Therefore, three distinct real roots? Wait, but x₂ is a double root, so in terms of distinct roots, it&#x27;s three: x₂, and one on each side. So multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect distinctness. Therefore, even though x₂ is a double root, it&#x27;s still one distinct root. So in that case, k = M gives three distinct real roots, with one of them being a double root. Wait, no. If a root is a double root, it&#x27;s still a single distinct root; the distinctness refers to the x-values. So x₂ is one distinct root, and the other two are also distinct. So in total, three distinct real roots, one with multiplicity two. Therefore, for the problem&#x27;s option (b): &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Well, when k = M or k = m₁ or k = m₃, you have three real roots, but with one double root. But the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would require all three roots to be distinct, i.e., no multiple roots. So in that case, even though at k = M you have three real roots, one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. Therefore, the answer would be that statement (b) is false. Wait, but when k is between m₃ and M, we have four distinct real roots. When k is between m₁ and m₃, three distinct real roots. When k is less than m₁ or greater than M, two distinct real roots. When k equals M, m₁, or m₃, three real roots with one double root.

Therefore, the statement (b) says: &quot;There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.&quot; Given that when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three distinct real roots (as per the earlier analysis). Wait, earlier I thought when k is between m₁ and m₃, we have three real roots. Wait, let&#x27;s recheck.

Wait, if k is between m₁ and m₃, which are the two local minima, then depending on the graph, how does the horizontal line intersect? Suppose m₁ is the left local minimum and m₃ is the right local minimum, with m₁ &lt; m₃. Then, k between m₁ and m₃ would be above m₁ and below m₃. Then, on the left side (x &lt; x₁), the function comes from +infty down to m₁, which is below k, so it crosses y = k once. Between x₁ and x₂, the function goes from m₁ up to M (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Between x₂ and x₃, the function goes from M down to m₃ (which is above k), so it crosses y = k once. Then, after x₃, the function goes from m₃ up to +infty, which is above k, so it doesn&#x27;t cross. Therefore, three real roots: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots because they are in different intervals. Therefore, statement (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima, we get three distinct real roots. Additionally, if m₁ &gt; m₃, then similar logic applies, just switch left and right.

Therefore, regardless of the relative positions of the minima, there exists a k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Therefore, option (b) is true.

But wait, the answer options are (a), (b), (c), (d). Let&#x27;s check the options again:

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

From the analysis above:

- (a) is false because for any real k, f(x) = k has either two, three, or four real roots. There is no k where it has exactly one real root.

- (b) is true because when k is between the two local minima (or between the higher local minimum and the local maximum, but actually in our case, between m₁ and m₃, assuming m₁ &lt; m₃), the equation f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

Wait, earlier, when k is between m₁ and m₃, which are both minima, the horizontal line y = k intersects the graph three times: left of x₁, between x₁ and x₂, and between x₂ and x₃. All three are distinct roots.

- (c) is false because when k is greater than M or less than m₁ (the lower of the two minima), f(x) = k has only two real roots.

- (d) is false because when k is between the two local minima or between a local minimum and the local maximum, f(x) = k has four or three real roots, respectively, so not always two real and two complex roots.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

But wait, the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, and the options are (a)-(d). The analysis above suggests that (b) is true. However, in the initial problem statement, it&#x27;s mentioned that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots. Wait, but in our analysis, we concluded that between the two local minima, we can get three real roots. But the key is that the quartic has three critical points: two minima and one maximum or two maxima and one minima, but in this case, with leading coefficient positive, it&#x27;s two minima and one maximum.

But let me verify with an example. Take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x + 1. Wait, maybe a simpler example. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 2x³ - 3x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 6x² - 6x. Let&#x27;s find the critical points.

Wait, maybe a better example is f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has three real roots: x = 0, x = sqrt(2), x = -sqrt(2). So the critical points are at x = -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). Then f(x) at these points: f(-sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(2))⁴ - 4*(sqrt(2))² = 4 - 8 = -4. f(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. f(sqrt(2)) = same as f(-sqrt(2)) = -4. So the local minima are at x = ±sqrt(2) with f(x) = -4, and the local maximum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0. So this is a symmetric quartic. Then, for k between -4 and 0, f(x) = k has four real roots. For k = 0, it has three real roots (double root at x = 0 and two at ±sqrt(something)). For k &lt; -4, two real roots. For k &gt; 0, two real roots. For k between the minima and the maximum (i.e., between -4 and 0), four real roots. For k exactly at -4, three real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). Wait, but in this case, the two minima are equal. So here, m₁ = m₃ = -4. Therefore, there is no interval between m₁ and m₃; they are the same. Therefore, in this symmetric case, when k is between -4 and 0, you get four real roots, but when k is exactly -4, you get two real roots (double roots at ±sqrt(2)). However, the original problem states that f&#x27;(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does: -sqrt(2), 0, sqrt(2). So in this case, the two minima are equal. Therefore, if the two local minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are equal), so the three real roots case doesn&#x27;t occur. Wait, but the problem says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot; for f’(x). In this example, f’(x) has three distinct real roots. But in this case, the minima are equal, so between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, you get four real roots. But if the minima are not equal, then between them, you would have three real roots.

Therefore, the key is whether the two local minima can be at different heights. If f’(x) has three distinct real roots, but the function f(x) could still have two equal minima. Wait, but in the example above, even with symmetric critical points, the minima are equal. So perhaps, depending on the coefficients, the minima can be equal or not. Therefore, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether the minima are equal or not, only that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Therefore, in some cases, you might have equal minima, in others not. Therefore, the answer would depend on whether, regardless of the specific f(x) meeting the condition, statement (b) is always true.

But wait, in the example where minima are equal, then there is no k between m₁ and m₃ (since they are the same), so the three real roots case would not exist. However, in that case, when k is between the minima (which are equal) and the maximum, which is the same as saying between m and M, you get four real roots. When k is less than m or greater than M, you get two real roots. When k equals m, you get two double roots. When k equals M, you get three real roots (a double root and two simple roots). Therefore, in the symmetric case, statement (b) is false because there is no k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. When k = M, you have three real roots but one is a double root, so they are not all distinct. When k is between m and M, you have four distinct real roots. When k is less than m, two distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric case, statement (b) is false. But the problem states that f’(x) has three distinct real roots, which in this example it does, but the minima are equal. Therefore, the correct answer would not always be (b). Therefore, my previous analysis was incorrect.

Therefore, there&#x27;s a problem: if the quartic is symmetric, with two equal minima, then there is no k for which f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) would not hold in such cases. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot; given that f’(x) has three distinct real roots. Since there exist such polynomials where statement (b) is false, but there also exist polynomials where statement (b) is true. Therefore, the answer depends on whether the statement must hold for all such polynomials or if there exists at least one. But the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;, implying that the statement must be always true given the conditions.

Therefore, since there exists a polynomial where f’(x) has three distinct real roots but there&#x27;s no k with three distinct real roots (like the symmetric quartic example), statement (b) is not always true. Therefore, my previous conclusion was wrong.

Then, what is the correct answer? Let&#x27;s re-examine the options.

(a) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has exactly one real root.

In the symmetric example, the only possible numbers of real roots are two (k &lt; m), four (m &lt; k &lt; M), three (k = m or k = M), or two (k &gt; M). So in this case, there is no k with exactly one real root. Therefore, statement (a) is false.

(b) There always exists a real constant k such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric example, when k = m or k = M, we have three real roots but with a double root, so they are not distinct. Therefore, in this case, there is no k with three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) is false.

(c) f(x) = k has four distinct real roots for any real number k.

False, since for k &gt; M or k &lt; m, there are only two real roots.

(d) f(x) = k has two real and two complex roots for any real number k.

False, since for some k, there are four real roots.

Therefore, in this case, none of the options are true? But that can&#x27;t be, because the problem says &quot;determine which of the following statements is true&quot;.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the symmetric example. Let&#x27;s take f(x) = x⁴ - 4x². Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 8x = 4x(x² - 2), which has roots at x = 0, sqrt(2), -sqrt(2). So three distinct real roots. The function f(x) = x⁴ - 4x² has local maxima at x = 0 (f(0) = 0) and local minima at x = ±sqrt(2) (f(±sqrt(2)) = -4). Then, for k = -4, the equation f(x) = -4 has double roots at x = ±sqrt(2). For k = 0, it has a double root at x = 0 and simple roots at x = ±2. So, in this case, when k = 0, the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. Therefore, three real roots, but only two distinct ones (x = 0 and x = ±2). Wait, no. If x = ±2 are roots, then total roots are x = 0 (double), x = 2, and x = -2. So four roots total, but with x = 0 counted twice. However, the equation x⁴ - 4x² = 0 factors as x²(x² - 4) = 0, so roots at x = 0 (multiplicity 2), x = 2, x = -2. So in this case, for k = 0, there are three distinct real roots (0, 2, -2), with one of them being a double root. Therefore, in terms of distinct real roots, it&#x27;s three. So, statement (b) says &quot;three distinct real roots&quot;, which would be true here because even though 0 is a double root, the roots are still distinct: -2, 0, 2. So in this case, k = 0 gives three distinct real roots, even with a double root at 0. Therefore, perhaps in this example, statement (b) is true.

Wait, but if we take k = -4, then f(x) = -4 has roots at x = ±sqrt(2), each with multiplicity two. So, two distinct real roots, each a double root. Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is not satisfied for k = -4, but for k = 0, we have three distinct real roots. Therefore, in this symmetric example, there does exist a k (specifically k = 0) such that f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Hence, statement (b) is true.

But earlier, I thought that when the minima are equal, there&#x27;s no k between them, but in reality, even in the symmetric case, there is a k (the local maximum) where you have three distinct real roots. So regardless of whether the minima are equal or not, the local maximum will always provide a k where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Let me check.

In the symmetric example, at k = 0 (the local maximum), the equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double root) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, statement (b) holds.

If we take another example where the minima are not equal. Let’s construct a quartic with two unequal minima. For example, f(x) = x⁴ - 4x³ + 2x² + 4x. Compute its derivative: f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x² + 4x + 4. I need to check if this derivative has three distinct real roots. Instead of computing, maybe take a known quartic. Let&#x27;s consider f(x) = x⁴ - 6x² + 4x. Then f’(x) = 4x³ - 12x + 4. Let&#x27;s check the roots of f’(x). Maybe this cubic has three real roots. Alternatively, use f(x) = x⁴ - 3x³ - 3x² + 4x + 1. Not sure. Alternatively, take f(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4), but that would have four real roots, but its derivative would have three critical points. However, expanding this would be time-consuming.

Alternatively, take a quartic with two minima at different heights. Suppose f(x) has a local minimum at x = 0 with f(0) = 0, a local maximum at x = 1 with f(1) = 2, and another local minimum at x = 2 with f(2) = 1. Then, the function would go from +infty down to 0 at x = 0, up to 2 at x = 1, down to 1 at x = 2, and back up to +infty. In this case, m₁ = 0, M = 2, m₃ = 1. Then, for k between m₁ = 0 and m₃ = 1, the equation f(x) = k would have three distinct real roots: one left of 0, one between 0 and 1, and one between 1 and 2. For k between m₃ = 1 and M = 2, four distinct real roots. For k = 1, three real roots (double root at x = 2 and two others). For k = 0, three real roots (double root at x = 0 and one other). For k = 2, three real roots (double root at x = 1 and two others). For k &lt; 0, two real roots; for k &gt; 2, two real roots.

Therefore, in this case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k between 0 and 1 (the two minima) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots.

In the symmetric case, even though the minima are equal, there&#x27;s still a k = M where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots (with a double root at the local maximum). Wait, no. In the symmetric case, k = M is the local maximum. For example, in f(x) = x⁴ - 4x², the local maximum is at x = 0 with k = 0. The equation f(x) = 0 has roots at x = 0 (double) and x = ±2. So three distinct real roots. Therefore, even in the symmetric case, statement (b) is true because there exists a k (specifically k = M) where f(x) = k has three distinct real roots. Even though one of them is a double root, but the roots are still distinct in terms of their x-values. Wait, no. A double root at x = 0 means that x = 0 is a repeated root, but the distinct roots are x = -2, x = 0, x = 2. Therefore, three distinct real roots. The multiplicity doesn&#x27;t affect the distinctness. Therefore, even if there is a multiple root, as long as there are three separate x-values, it&#x27;s three distinct real roots. Therefore, in both symmetric and asymmetric cases, statement (b) holds.

Therefore, the correct answer is (b).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{B}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) with real coefficients, we know that its derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) has three distinct real roots. This implies that \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum (since the leading coefficient is positive, the polynomial tends to \( +\infty \) as \( x \to \pm\infty \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Critical Points and Graph Shape**:
   - The polynomial \( f(x) \) has three critical points: two local minima and one local maximum.
   - The graph of \( f(x) \) will have a &quot;W&quot; shape with two local minima and one local maximum.

2. **Behavior of \( f(x) = k \)**:
   - For \( k \) values greater than the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to the local maximum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local maximum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the local maximum and the higher local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has four real roots.
   - For \( k \) equal to either local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has three real roots (one double root at the local minimum and two simple roots).
   - For \( k \) between the two local minima, \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - For \( k \) values less than the lower local minimum, \( f(x) = k \) has two real roots.

3. **Evaluation of Statements**:
   - **(a)** False: There is no \( k \) such that \( f(x) = k \) has exactly one real root.
   - **(b)** True: There exists a \( k \) (between the two local minima) where \( f(x) = k \) has three distinct real roots.
   - **(c)** False: \( f(x) = k \) does not always have four distinct real roots (e.g., for \( k \) outside the range between the local minima and maximum).
   - **(d)** False: \( f(x) = k \) can have four real roots for some \( k \), so it does not always have two real and two complex roots.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is \(\boxed{B}\).          </p>

\[\frac{1}{\tau} + \frac{1}{\tau^2} + \frac{1}{\tau^3} + \dotsb = \frac{1/\tau}{1 - 1/\tau} = \frac{1}{\tau - 1}.\]Recall that $\tau$ satisfies $\tau^2 - \tau - 1 = 0.$  Then $\tau (\tau - 1) = 1,$ so
\[\frac{1}{\tau - 1} = \tau.\]Thus, $n = \boxed{1}.$          </p>
