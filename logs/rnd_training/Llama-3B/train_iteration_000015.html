Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this question here: If a function \( f: \mathbb{T} \to \mathbb{C} \) is given by \( f(t) = \sum_{k} a_k e^{ikt} \), and the Fourier coefficients \( a_k \) are in \( \ell^1 \), meaning \( \sum_{k} |a_k| &lt; \infty \), is \( f \) necessarily a continuous function? Hmm, interesting. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with Fourier series, the properties of the coefficients can tell us a lot about the function itself. For instance, if the coefficients are absolutely summable (i.e., in \( \ell^1 \)), that should imply something about the convergence of the series, right?

So, the function is expressed as a sum of complex exponentials \( e^{ikt} \), each multiplied by a coefficient \( a_k \). The question is whether the absolute summability of these coefficients guarantees the continuity of \( f \).

Let me recall some theorems from Fourier analysis. There&#x27;s a result that says if the Fourier coefficients are absolutely summable, then the Fourier series converges absolutely and uniformly to the function \( f \). And uniform convergence preserves continuity, right? Because if each partial sum is continuous (which they are, being finite sums of continuous functions), and the convergence is uniform, then the limit function \( f \) must also be continuous.

Wait, is that correct? Let me verify. The uniform limit theorem states that if a sequence of continuous functions converges uniformly on a metric space, then the limit function is also continuous. Yes, that&#x27;s right. So if \( \sum |a_k| &lt; \infty \), then the series \( \sum a_k e^{ikt} \) converges absolutely and uniformly because \( |a_k e^{ikt}| = |a_k| \), so the Weierstrass M-test applies with \( M_k = |a_k| \), and since \( \sum M_k &lt; \infty \), the series converges uniformly. Therefore, the function \( f \) is the uniform limit of continuous functions, hence continuous.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, \( f \) is necessarily continuous.

But let me check if there are any subtleties here. For example, does this hold for functions on the torus \( \mathbb{T} \), which I assume is the circle group, i.e., the interval \([0, 2\pi)\) with endpoints identified. So, we&#x27;re dealing with 1-periodic functions on the real line, essentially.

But in that case, the uniform convergence on \( \mathbb{T} \) would imply continuity on \( \mathbb{T} \), which is a compact space. So continuity here would be equivalent to uniform continuity, but since the function is already the uniform limit of continuous functions, it&#x27;s continuous regardless.

Another point to consider: could there be a case where even though the coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \), the function has a discontinuity? For example, the Fourier series of a discontinuous function like a step function typically has coefficients that decay like \( 1/k \), which are in \( \ell^2 \) but not in \( \ell^1 \). So, maybe functions with \( \ell^1 \) coefficients are indeed continuous.

Wait, the canonical example of a discontinuous function with Fourier series is the sawtooth wave or the square wave, whose Fourier coefficients are of order \( 1/k \), so their coefficients are in \( \ell^2 \) (since \( \sum 1/k^2 \) converges) but not in \( \ell^1 \) (since \( \sum 1/k \) diverges). Therefore, such discontinuous functions do not have Fourier coefficients in \( \ell^1 \). That supports the idea that if the coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \), the function must be continuous.

Therefore, putting this all together: absolute summability of Fourier coefficients implies uniform convergence of the Fourier series, which in turn implies the limit function is continuous. Additionally, known examples of discontinuous functions have non-summable coefficients. Hence, the answer should be yes, \( f \) is necessarily continuous.

Wait, just to be thorough, is there any continuous function whose Fourier coefficients are not in \( \ell^1 \)? Because that would complicate things. For example, if a continuous function has Fourier coefficients not in \( \ell^1 \), but here we are given that the coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \). So the question is the converse: does \( \ell^1 \) coefficients guarantee continuity. The other direction isn&#x27;t in question here.

But just to confirm, there are continuous functions whose Fourier coefficients are not in \( \ell^1 \). For example, consider a continuous function with Fourier coefficients decaying like \( 1/k^{1/2} \); then the coefficients would be in \( \ell^2 \) but not \( \ell^1 \). However, such a function would have a Fourier series that converges in \( L^2 \), but not necessarily uniformly. However, such a function would still be continuous, but with non-absolutely-summable coefficients. Wait, but the point is, the question is not whether all continuous functions have \( \ell^1 \) coefficients (they don&#x27;t), but whether all functions with \( \ell^1 \) coefficients are continuous, which seems to be the case.

Another angle: the space of functions with absolutely convergent Fourier series is called the Wiener algebra, right? And I recall that the Wiener algebra consists of continuous functions. So that also supports the answer.

Therefore, after considering various aspects and verifying through theorems and examples, I think the conclusion is that yes, \( f \) must be continuous if its Fourier coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a function \( f: \mathbb{T} \to \mathbb{C} \) defined by \( f(t) = \sum_{k} a_k e^{ikt} \) with Fourier coefficients \( a_k \) belonging to \( \ell^1 \) (i.e., \( \sum_{k} |a_k| &lt; \infty \)), we need to determine if \( f \) is necessarily continuous.

1. **Absolute and Uniform Convergence**: The condition \( \sum_{k} |a_k| &lt; \infty \) implies that the series \( \sum_{k} a_k e^{ikt} \) converges absolutely. By the Weierstrass M-test, with \( M_k = |a_k| \), the series converges uniformly on \( \mathbb{T} \).

2. **Uniform Limit of Continuous Functions**: Each partial sum \( \sum_{k=-N}^{N} a_k e^{ikt} \) is a finite sum of continuous functions (complex exponentials), hence continuous. The uniform convergence of these partial sums to \( f \) ensures that \( f \) is continuous, as the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous.

3. **Counterexamples and Wiener Algebra**: Discontinuous functions, such as square waves, have Fourier coefficients that decay like \( 1/k \), which are not in \( \ell^1 \). Functions with Fourier coefficients in \( \ell^1 \) form the Wiener algebra, which consists of continuous functions.

Thus, the function \( f \) must be continuous if its Fourier coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this question here: If a function \( f: \mathbb{T} \to \mathbb{C} \) is given by \( f(t) = \sum_{k} a_k e^{ikt} \), and the Fourier coefficients \( a_k \) are in \( \ell^1 \), meaning \( \sum_{k} |a_k| &lt; \infty \), is \( f \) necessarily a continuous function? Hmm, interesting. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with Fourier series, the properties of the coefficients can tell us a lot about the function itself. For instance, if the coefficients are absolutely summable (i.e., in \( \ell^1 \)), that should imply something about the convergence of the series, right?

So, the function is expressed as a sum of complex exponentials \( e^{ikt} \), each multiplied by a coefficient \( a_k \). The question is whether the absolute summability of these coefficients guarantees the continuity of \( f \).

Let me recall some theorems from Fourier analysis. There&#x27;s a result that says if the Fourier coefficients are absolutely summable, then the Fourier series converges absolutely and uniformly to the function \( f \). And uniform convergence preserves continuity, right? Because if each partial sum is continuous (which they are, being finite sums of continuous functions), and the convergence is uniform, then the limit function \( f \) must also be continuous.

Wait, is that correct? Let me verify. The uniform limit theorem states that if a sequence of continuous functions converges uniformly on a metric space, then the limit function is also continuous. Yes, that&#x27;s right. So if \( \sum |a_k| &lt; \infty \), then the series \( \sum a_k e^{ikt} \) converges absolutely and uniformly because \( |a_k e^{ikt}| = |a_k| \), so the Weierstrass M-test applies with \( M_k = |a_k| \), and since \( \sum M_k &lt; \infty \), the series converges uniformly. Therefore, the function \( f \) is the uniform limit of continuous functions, hence continuous.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, \( f \) is necessarily continuous.

But let me check if there are any subtleties here. For example, does this hold for functions on the torus \( \mathbb{T} \), which I assume is the circle group, i.e., the interval \([0, 2\pi)\) with endpoints identified. So, we&#x27;re dealing with 1-periodic functions on the real line, essentially.

But in that case, the uniform convergence on \( \mathbb{T} \) would imply continuity on \( \mathbb{T} \), which is a compact space. So continuity here would be equivalent to uniform continuity, but since the function is already the uniform limit of continuous functions, it&#x27;s continuous regardless.

Another point to consider: could there be a case where even though the coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \), the function has a discontinuity? For example, the Fourier series of a discontinuous function like a step function typically has coefficients that decay like \( 1/k \), which are in \( \ell^2 \) but not in \( \ell^1 \). So, maybe functions with \( \ell^1 \) coefficients are indeed continuous.

Wait, the canonical example of a discontinuous function with Fourier series is the sawtooth wave or the square wave, whose Fourier coefficients are of order \( 1/k \), so their coefficients are in \( \ell^2 \) (since \( \sum 1/k^2 \) converges) but not in \( \ell^1 \) (since \( \sum 1/k \) diverges). Therefore, such discontinuous functions do not have Fourier coefficients in \( \ell^1 \). That supports the idea that if the coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \), the function must be continuous.

Therefore, putting this all together: absolute summability of Fourier coefficients implies uniform convergence of the Fourier series, which in turn implies the limit function is continuous. Additionally, known examples of discontinuous functions have non-summable coefficients. Hence, the answer should be yes, \( f \) is necessarily continuous.

Wait, just to be thorough, is there any continuous function whose Fourier coefficients are not in \( \ell^1 \)? Because that would complicate things. For example, if a continuous function has Fourier coefficients not in \( \ell^1 \), but here we are given that the coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \). So the question is the converse: does \( \ell^1 \) coefficients guarantee continuity. The other direction isn&#x27;t in question here.

But just to confirm, there are continuous functions whose Fourier coefficients are not in \( \ell^1 \). For example, consider a continuous function with Fourier coefficients decaying like \( 1/k^{1/2} \); then the coefficients would be in \( \ell^2 \) but not \( \ell^1 \). However, such a function would have a Fourier series that converges in \( L^2 \), but not necessarily uniformly. However, such a function would still be continuous, but with non-absolutely-summable coefficients. Wait, but the point is, the question is not whether all continuous functions have \( \ell^1 \) coefficients (they don&#x27;t), but whether all functions with \( \ell^1 \) coefficients are continuous, which seems to be the case.

Another angle: the space of functions with absolutely convergent Fourier series is called the Wiener algebra, right? And I recall that the Wiener algebra consists of continuous functions. So that also supports the answer.

Therefore, after considering various aspects and verifying through theorems and examples, I think the conclusion is that yes, \( f \) must be continuous if its Fourier coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a function \( f: \mathbb{T} \to \mathbb{C} \) defined by \( f(t) = \sum_{k} a_k e^{ikt} \) with Fourier coefficients \( a_k \) belonging to \( \ell^1 \) (i.e., \( \sum_{k} |a_k| &lt; \infty \)), we need to determine if \( f \) is necessarily continuous.

1. **Absolute and Uniform Convergence**: The condition \( \sum_{k} |a_k| &lt; \infty \) implies that the series \( \sum_{k} a_k e^{ikt} \) converges absolutely. By the Weierstrass M-test, with \( M_k = |a_k| \), the series converges uniformly on \( \mathbb{T} \).

2. **Uniform Limit of Continuous Functions**: Each partial sum \( \sum_{k=-N}^{N} a_k e^{ikt} \) is a finite sum of continuous functions (complex exponentials), hence continuous. The uniform convergence of these partial sums to \( f \) ensures that \( f \) is continuous, as the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous.

3. **Counterexamples and Wiener Algebra**: Discontinuous functions, such as square waves, have Fourier coefficients that decay like \( 1/k \), which are not in \( \ell^1 \). Functions with Fourier coefficients in \( \ell^1 \) form the Wiener algebra, which consists of continuous functions.

Thus, the function \( f \) must be continuous if its Fourier coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this question here: If a function \( f: \mathbb{T} \to \mathbb{C} \) is given by \( f(t) = \sum_{k} a_k e^{ikt} \), and the Fourier coefficients \( a_k \) are in \( \ell^1 \), meaning \( \sum_{k} |a_k| &lt; \infty \), is \( f \) necessarily a continuous function? Hmm, interesting. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with Fourier series, the properties of the coefficients can tell us a lot about the function itself. For instance, if the coefficients are absolutely summable (i.e., in \( \ell^1 \)), that should imply something about the convergence of the series, right?

So, the function is expressed as a sum of complex exponentials \( e^{ikt} \), each multiplied by a coefficient \( a_k \). The question is whether the absolute summability of these coefficients guarantees the continuity of \( f \).

Let me recall some theorems from Fourier analysis. There&#x27;s a result that says if the Fourier coefficients are absolutely summable, then the Fourier series converges absolutely and uniformly to the function \( f \). And uniform convergence preserves continuity, right? Because if each partial sum is continuous (which they are, being finite sums of continuous functions), and the convergence is uniform, then the limit function \( f \) must also be continuous.

Wait, is that correct? Let me verify. The uniform limit theorem states that if a sequence of continuous functions converges uniformly on a metric space, then the limit function is also continuous. Yes, that&#x27;s right. So if \( \sum |a_k| &lt; \infty \), then the series \( \sum a_k e^{ikt} \) converges absolutely and uniformly because \( |a_k e^{ikt}| = |a_k| \), so the Weierstrass M-test applies with \( M_k = |a_k| \), and since \( \sum M_k &lt; \infty \), the series converges uniformly. Therefore, the function \( f \) is the uniform limit of continuous functions, hence continuous.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, \( f \) is necessarily continuous.

But let me check if there are any subtleties here. For example, does this hold for functions on the torus \( \mathbb{T} \), which I assume is the circle group, i.e., the interval \([0, 2\pi)\) with endpoints identified. So, we&#x27;re dealing with 1-periodic functions on the real line, essentially.

But in that case, the uniform convergence on \( \mathbb{T} \) would imply continuity on \( \mathbb{T} \), which is a compact space. So continuity here would be equivalent to uniform continuity, but since the function is already the uniform limit of continuous functions, it&#x27;s continuous regardless.

Another point to consider: could there be a case where even though the coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \), the function has a discontinuity? For example, the Fourier series of a discontinuous function like a step function typically has coefficients that decay like \( 1/k \), which are in \( \ell^2 \) but not in \( \ell^1 \). So, maybe functions with \( \ell^1 \) coefficients are indeed continuous.

Wait, the canonical example of a discontinuous function with Fourier series is the sawtooth wave or the square wave, whose Fourier coefficients are of order \( 1/k \), so their coefficients are in \( \ell^2 \) (since \( \sum 1/k^2 \) converges) but not in \( \ell^1 \) (since \( \sum 1/k \) diverges). Therefore, such discontinuous functions do not have Fourier coefficients in \( \ell^1 \). That supports the idea that if the coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \), the function must be continuous.

Therefore, putting this all together: absolute summability of Fourier coefficients implies uniform convergence of the Fourier series, which in turn implies the limit function is continuous. Additionally, known examples of discontinuous functions have non-summable coefficients. Hence, the answer should be yes, \( f \) is necessarily continuous.

Wait, just to be thorough, is there any continuous function whose Fourier coefficients are not in \( \ell^1 \)? Because that would complicate things. For example, if a continuous function has Fourier coefficients not in \( \ell^1 \), but here we are given that the coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \). So the question is the converse: does \( \ell^1 \) coefficients guarantee continuity. The other direction isn&#x27;t in question here.

But just to confirm, there are continuous functions whose Fourier coefficients are not in \( \ell^1 \). For example, consider a continuous function with Fourier coefficients decaying like \( 1/k^{1/2} \); then the coefficients would be in \( \ell^2 \) but not \( \ell^1 \). However, such a function would have a Fourier series that converges in \( L^2 \), but not necessarily uniformly. However, such a function would still be continuous, but with non-absolutely-summable coefficients. Wait, but the point is, the question is not whether all continuous functions have \( \ell^1 \) coefficients (they don&#x27;t), but whether all functions with \( \ell^1 \) coefficients are continuous, which seems to be the case.

Another angle: the space of functions with absolutely convergent Fourier series is called the Wiener algebra, right? And I recall that the Wiener algebra consists of continuous functions. So that also supports the answer.

Therefore, after considering various aspects and verifying through theorems and examples, I think the conclusion is that yes, \( f \) must be continuous if its Fourier coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \).

\boxed{Yes}

2. **Uniform Limit of Continuous Functions**: Each partial sum \( \sum_{k=-N}^{N} a_k e^{ikt} \) is a finite sum of continuous functions (complex exponentials), hence continuous.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this question here: If a function \( f: \mathbb{T} \to \mathbb{C} \) is given by \( f(t) = \sum_{k} a_k e^{ikt} \), and the Fourier coefficients \( a_k \) are in \( \ell^1 \), meaning \( \sum_{k} |a_k| &lt; \infty \), is \( f \) necessarily a continuous function? Hmm, interesting. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with Fourier series, the properties of the coefficients can tell us a lot about the function itself. For instance, if the coefficients are absolutely summable (i.e., in \( \ell^1 \)), that should imply something about the convergence of the series, right?

So, the function is expressed as a sum of complex exponentials \( e^{ikt} \), each multiplied by a coefficient \( a_k \). The question is whether the absolute summability of these coefficients guarantees the continuity of \( f \).

Let me recall some theorems from Fourier analysis. There&#x27;s a result that says if the Fourier coefficients are absolutely summable, then the Fourier series converges absolutely and uniformly to the function \( f \). And uniform convergence preserves continuity, right? Because if each partial sum is continuous (which they are, being finite sums of continuous functions), and the convergence is uniform, then the limit function \( f \) must also be continuous.

Wait, is that correct? Let me verify. The uniform limit theorem states that if a sequence of continuous functions converges uniformly on a metric space, then the limit function is also continuous. Yes, that&#x27;s right. So if \( \sum |a_k| &lt; \infty \), then the series \( \sum a_k e^{ikt} \) converges absolutely and uniformly because \( |a_k e^{ikt}| = |a_k| \), so the Weierstrass M-test applies with \( M_k = |a_k| \), and since \( \sum M_k &lt; \infty \), the series converges uniformly. Therefore, the function \( f \) is the uniform limit of continuous functions, hence continuous.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, \( f \) is necessarily continuous.

But let me check if there are any subtleties here. For example, does this hold for functions on the torus \( \mathbb{T} \), which I assume is the circle group, i.e., the interval \([0, 2\pi)\) with endpoints identified. So, we&#x27;re dealing with 1-periodic functions on the real line, essentially.

But in that case, the uniform convergence on \( \mathbb{T} \) would imply continuity on \( \mathbb{T} \), which is a compact space. So continuity here would be equivalent to uniform continuity, but since the function is already the uniform limit of continuous functions, it&#x27;s continuous regardless.

Another point to consider: could there be a case where even though the coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \), the function has a discontinuity? For example, the Fourier series of a discontinuous function like a step function typically has coefficients that decay like \( 1/k \), which are in \( \ell^2 \) but not in \( \ell^1 \). So, maybe functions with \( \ell^1 \) coefficients are indeed continuous.

Wait, the canonical example of a discontinuous function with Fourier series is the sawtooth wave or the square wave, whose Fourier coefficients are of order \( 1/k \), so their coefficients are in \( \ell^2 \) (since \( \sum 1/k^2 \) converges) but not in \( \ell^1 \) (since \( \sum 1/k \) diverges). Therefore, such discontinuous functions do not have Fourier coefficients in \( \ell^1 \). That supports the idea that if the coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \), the function must be continuous.

Therefore, putting this all together: absolute summability of Fourier coefficients implies uniform convergence of the Fourier series, which in turn implies the limit function is continuous. Additionally, known examples of discontinuous functions have non-summable coefficients. Hence, the answer should be yes, \( f \) is necessarily continuous.

Wait, just to be thorough, is there any continuous function whose Fourier coefficients are not in \( \ell^1 \)? Because that would complicate things. For example, if a continuous function has Fourier coefficients not in \( \ell^1 \), but here we are given that the coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \). So the question is the converse: does \( \ell^1 \) coefficients guarantee continuity. The other direction isn&#x27;t in question here.

But just to confirm, there are continuous functions whose Fourier coefficients are not in \( \ell^1 \). For example, consider a continuous function with Fourier coefficients decaying like \( 1/k^{1/2} \); then the coefficients would be in \( \ell^2 \) but not \( \ell^1 \). However, such a function would have a Fourier series that converges in \( L^2 \), but not necessarily uniformly. However, such a function would still be continuous, but with non-absolutely-summable coefficients. Wait, but the point is, the question is not whether all continuous functions have \( \ell^1 \) coefficients (they don&#x27;t), but whether all functions with \( \ell^1 \) coefficients are continuous, which seems to be the case.

Another angle: the space of functions with absolutely convergent Fourier series is called the Wiener algebra, right? And I recall that the Wiener algebra consists of continuous functions. So that also supports the answer.

Therefore, after considering various aspects and verifying through theorems and examples, I think the conclusion is that yes, \( f \) must be continuous if its Fourier coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \).

Given a function \( f: \mathbb{T} \to \mathbb{C} \) defined by \( f(t) = \sum_{k} a_k e^{ikt} \) with Fourier coefficients \( a_k \) belonging to \( \ell^1 \) (i.e., \( \sum_{k} |a_k| &lt; \infty \)), we need to determine if \( f \) is necessarily continuous.

1. **Absolute and Uniform Convergence**: The condition \( \sum_{k} |a_k| &lt; \infty \) implies that the series \( \sum_{k} a_k e^{ikt} \) converges absolutely. By the Weierstrass M-test, with \( M_k = |a_k| \), the series converges uniformly on \( \mathbb{T} \).

2. **Uniform Limit of Continuous Functions**: Each partial sum \( \sum_{k=-N}^{N} a_k e^{ikt} \) is a finite sum of continuous functions (complex exponentials), hence continuous. The uniform convergence of these partial sums to \( f \) ensures that \( f \) is continuous, as the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous.

3. **Counterexamples and Wiener Algebra**: Discontinuous functions, such as square waves, have Fourier coefficients that decay like \( 1/k \), which are not in \( \ell^1 \). Functions with Fourier coefficients in \( \ell^1 \) form the Wiener algebra, which consists of continuous functions.

Thus, the function \( f \) must be continuous if its Fourier coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \).

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this question here: If a function \( f: \mathbb{T} \to \mathbb{C} \) is given by \( f(t) = \sum_{k} a_k e^{ikt} \), and the Fourier coefficients \( a_k \) are in \( \ell^1 \), meaning \( \sum_{k} |a_k| &lt; \infty \), is \( f \) necessarily a continuous function? Hmm, interesting. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with Fourier series, the properties of the coefficients can tell us a lot about the function itself. For instance, if the coefficients are absolutely summable (i.e., in \( \ell^1 \)), that should imply something about the convergence of the series, right?

So, the function is expressed as a sum of complex exponentials \( e^{ikt} \), each multiplied by a coefficient \( a_k \). The question is whether the absolute summability of these coefficients guarantees the continuity of \( f \).

Let me recall some theorems from Fourier analysis. There&#x27;s a result that says if the Fourier coefficients are absolutely summable, then the Fourier series converges absolutely and uniformly to the function \( f \). And uniform convergence preserves continuity, right? Because if each partial sum is continuous (which they are, being finite sums of continuous functions), and the convergence is uniform, then the limit function \( f \) must also be continuous.

Wait, is that correct? Let me verify. The uniform limit theorem states that if a sequence of continuous functions converges uniformly on a metric space, then the limit function is also continuous. Yes, that&#x27;s right. So if \( \sum |a_k| &lt; \infty \), then the series \( \sum a_k e^{ikt} \) converges absolutely and uniformly because \( |a_k e^{ikt}| = |a_k| \), so the Weierstrass M-test applies with \( M_k = |a_k| \), and since \( \sum M_k &lt; \infty \), the series converges uniformly. Therefore, the function \( f \) is the uniform limit of continuous functions, hence continuous.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, \( f \) is necessarily continuous.

But let me check if there are any subtleties here. For example, does this hold for functions on the torus \( \mathbb{T} \), which I assume is the circle group, i.e., the interval \([0, 2\pi)\) with endpoints identified. So, we&#x27;re dealing with 1-periodic functions on the real line, essentially.

But in that case, the uniform convergence on \( \mathbb{T} \) would imply continuity on \( \mathbb{T} \), which is a compact space. So continuity here would be equivalent to uniform continuity, but since the function is already the uniform limit of continuous functions, it&#x27;s continuous regardless.

Another point to consider: could there be a case where even though the coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \), the function has a discontinuity? For example, the Fourier series of a discontinuous function like a step function typically has coefficients that decay like \( 1/k \), which are in \( \ell^2 \) but not in \( \ell^1 \). So, maybe functions with \( \ell^1 \) coefficients are indeed continuous.

Wait, the canonical example of a discontinuous function with Fourier series is the sawtooth wave or the square wave, whose Fourier coefficients are of order \( 1/k \), so their coefficients are in \( \ell^2 \) (since \( \sum 1/k^2 \) converges) but not in \( \ell^1 \) (since \( \sum 1/k \) diverges). Therefore, such discontinuous functions do not have Fourier coefficients in \( \ell^1 \). That supports the idea that if the coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \), the function must be continuous.

Therefore, putting this all together: absolute summability of Fourier coefficients implies uniform convergence of the Fourier series, which in turn implies the limit function is continuous. Additionally, known examples of discontinuous functions have non-summable coefficients. Hence, the answer should be yes, \( f \) is necessarily continuous.

Wait, just to be thorough, is there any continuous function whose Fourier coefficients are not in \( \ell^1 \)? Because that would complicate things. For example, if a continuous function has Fourier coefficients not in \( \ell^1 \), but here we are given that the coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \). So the question is the converse: does \( \ell^1 \) coefficients guarantee continuity. The other direction isn&#x27;t in question here.

But just to confirm, there are continuous functions whose Fourier coefficients are not in \( \ell^1 \). For example, consider a continuous function with Fourier coefficients decaying like \( 1/k^{1/2} \); then the coefficients would be in \( \ell^2 \) but not \( \ell^1 \). However, such a function would have a Fourier series that converges in \( L^2 \), but not necessarily uniformly. However, such a function would still be continuous, but with non-absolutely-summable coefficients. Wait, but the point is, the question is not whether all continuous functions have \( \ell^1 \) coefficients (they don&#x27;t), but whether all functions with \( \ell^1 \) coefficients are continuous, which seems to be the case.

Another angle: the space of functions with absolutely convergent Fourier series is called the Wiener algebra, right? And I recall that the Wiener algebra consists of continuous functions. So that also supports the answer.

Therefore, after considering various aspects and verifying through theorems and examples, I think the conclusion is that yes, \( f \) must be continuous if its Fourier coefficients are in \( \ell^1 \).

Reference Answer: Okay, let&#x27;s try to figure out whether the statement is true or false. The question is: &quot;A semisimple Lie algebra over the complex numbers always has the property that the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra.&quot; Hmm. Alright, let&#x27;s start by recalling some definitions and theorems related to semisimple Lie algebras, adjoint representations, and derivation algebras.

First, a semisimple Lie algebra is a Lie algebra that is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras, none of which are abelian. So, semisimple means no nontrivial solvable ideals, right? And over the complex numbers, these have been classified by Cartan and Killing, so they are well-understood.

The adjoint representation of a Lie algebra, denoted ad, is a map from the Lie algebra to its endomorphism algebra, defined by ad(x)(y) = [x, y]. The image of this map is the set of inner derivations. For a semisimple Lie algebra, I remember that the adjoint representation is faithful, which means that the map ad is injective. Since the Lie algebra is semisimple, its center is trivial, so the kernel of ad is zero. That tells us that the adjoint representation is an embedding of the Lie algebra into its derivation algebra.

Now, the derivation algebra, Der(L), of a Lie algebra L consists of all linear maps D: L → L such that D([x, y]) = [D(x), y] + [x, D(y)] for all x, y in L. Inner derivations are those of the form ad(x) for some x in L, and the set of inner derivations is denoted Inn(L). In general, Inn(L) is an ideal of Der(L).

The question is asking whether, for a semisimple Lie algebra over ℂ, we have that Inn(L) = Der(L). In other words, are all derivations inner?

I think that for semisimple Lie algebras, all derivations are inner. Wait, isn&#x27;t that a theorem? Let me recall. If a Lie algebra is semisimple, then every derivation is inner. Therefore, Der(L) = Inn(L). But Inn(L) is the image of the adjoint representation, which in this case is isomorphic to L since the adjoint representation is faithful. So then Der(L) ≅ L via the adjoint representation. Therefore, the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra. So the statement should be true?

But hold on, let me verify this. Let me check the standard results. In Humphrey&#x27;s Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory, Chapter II, Section 5, there&#x27;s a theorem (Theorem 5.3) that states that if L is a semisimple Lie algebra, then every derivation of L is inner; that is, ad(L) = Der(L). So that seems to confirm it. Therefore, the statement is true.

Wait, but let me double-check. Suppose L is semisimple, then Z(L) = 0, so ad is injective, hence ad(L) ≅ L. Then, since all derivations are inner, Der(L) = ad(L). Therefore, the adjoint representation (which is ad(L)) is equal to Der(L). Therefore, the answer should be true.

But maybe there is a subtlety here? For example, if the Lie algebra is not of adjoint type? Wait, no. The adjoint representation is a representation, not a type of Lie algebra. The adjoint representation is always a homomorphism into Der(L), and for semisimple Lie algebras, this is an isomorphism. So, over complex numbers, since L is semisimple, Der(L) is isomorphic to L via ad. Therefore, the statement is true.

Alternatively, maybe the confusion is between the adjoint representation and the derivation algebra as vector spaces? But the question says &quot;the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra&quot;. Wait, the adjoint representation is a homomorphism from L to End(L), and its image is ad(L) = Inn(L). So when the question says &quot;the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra&quot;, they probably mean that Inn(L) = Der(L). Since Inn(L) is the image of the adjoint representation, and Der(L) is the algebra of derivations.

Therefore, if Inn(L) = Der(L), then yes, the adjoint representation (its image) is equal to the derivation algebra. And since for semisimple Lie algebras, all derivations are inner, this equality holds. Therefore, the statement is true.

But let me check an example. Take sl(2, ℂ), which is a simple Lie algebra. Its derivations are all inner. So Der(sl(2, ℂ)) ≅ sl(2, ℂ) via the adjoint representation. Similarly, for any semisimple Lie algebra, this should hold. So, yes, the statement is true.

Wait, maybe the problem is with the wording? The question says &quot;the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra&quot;. But the adjoint representation is a Lie algebra homomorphism, while the derivation algebra is a Lie algebra. So strictly speaking, the adjoint representation is a map, and the derivation algebra is a Lie algebra. So perhaps the correct phrasing should be that the image of the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra. But in the context of Lie algebras, when people say &quot;the adjoint representation&quot;, sometimes they refer to the image, which is Inn(L). So maybe the question is using &quot;adjoint representation&quot; to mean Inn(L). Then, the question is whether Inn(L) = Der(L) for semisimple Lie algebras over ℂ. And the answer is yes, as per the theorem.

Therefore, the answer should be True.

To determine whether the statement &quot;A semisimple Lie algebra over the complex numbers always has the property that the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra&quot; is true or false, we need to recall some key concepts and theorems related to semisimple Lie algebras, adjoint representations, and derivation algebras.

1. **Semisimple Lie Algebras**: A semisimple Lie algebra is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras, none of which are abelian. They have no nontrivial solvable ideals and a trivial center.

2. **Adjoint Representation**: The adjoint representation, denoted \(\text{ad}\), maps a Lie algebra \(L\) to its endomorphism algebra, defined by \(\text{ad}(x)(y) = [x, y]\). For a semisimple Lie algebra, this representation is faithful (injective) because the center is trivial.

3. **Derivation Algebra**: The derivation algebra \(\text{Der}(L)\) consists of all linear maps \(D: L \to L\) satisfying the Leibniz rule. Inner derivations \(\text{Inn}(L)\) are those of the form \(\text{ad}(x)\) for \(x \in L\).

4. **Key Theorem**: For a semisimple Lie algebra, every derivation is inner. This means \(\text{Der}(L) = \text{Inn}(L)\). Since the adjoint representation is faithful, \(\text{Inn}(L)\) is isomorphic to \(L\), and thus \(\text{Der}(L)\) is isomorphic to \(L\) via the adjoint representation.

Given that the image of the adjoint representation (which is \(\text{Inn}(L)\)) is equal to the derivation algebra \(\text{Der}(L)\) for semisimple Lie algebras over \(\mathbb{C}\), the statement is true.

But maybe there is a subtlety here? For example, if the Lie algebra is not of adjoint type? Wait, no. The adjoint representation is a representation, not a type of Lie algebra. The adjoint representation is always a homomorphism into Der(L), and for semisimple Lie algebras, this is an isomorphism. So, over complex numbers, since L is semisimple, Der(L) is isomorphic to L via ad. Therefore, the statement is true.

Alternatively, maybe the confusion is between the adjoint representation and the derivation algebra as vector spaces? But the question says &quot;the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra&quot;. Wait, the adjoint representation is a homomorphism from L to End(L), and its image is ad(L) = Inn(L). So when the question says &quot;the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra&quot;, they probably mean that Inn(L) = Der(L). Since Inn(L) is the image of the adjoint representation, and Der(L) is the algebra of derivations.

Therefore, if Inn(L) = Der(L), then yes, the adjoint representation (its image) is equal to the derivation algebra. And since for semisimple Lie algebras, all derivations are inner, this equality holds. Therefore, the statement is true.

But let me check an example. Take sl(2, ℂ), which is a simple Lie algebra. Its derivations are all inner. So Der(sl(2, ℂ)) ≅ sl(2, ℂ) via the adjoint representation. Similarly, for any semisimple Lie algebra, this should hold. So, yes, the statement is true.

Wait, maybe the problem is with the wording? The question says &quot;the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra&quot;. But the adjoint representation is a Lie algebra homomorphism, while the derivation algebra is a Lie algebra. So strictly speaking, the adjoint representation is a map, and the derivation algebra is a Lie algebra. So perhaps the correct phrasing should be that the image of the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra. But in the context of Lie algebras, when people say &quot;the adjoint representation&quot;, sometimes they refer to the image, which is Inn(L). So maybe the question is using &quot;adjoint representation&quot; to mean Inn(L). Then, the question is whether Inn(L) = Der(L) for semisimple Lie algebras over ℂ. And the answer is yes, as per the theorem.

Therefore, the answer should be True.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{A}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the statement &quot;A semisimple Lie algebra over the complex numbers always has the property that the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra&quot; is true or false, we need to recall some key concepts and theorems related to semisimple Lie algebras, adjoint representations, and derivation algebras.

1. **Semisimple Lie Algebras**: A semisimple Lie algebra is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras, none of which are abelian. They have no nontrivial solvable ideals and a trivial center.

2. **Adjoint Representation**: The adjoint representation, denoted \(\text{ad}\), maps a Lie algebra \(L\) to its endomorphism algebra, defined by \(\text{ad}(x)(y) = [x, y]\). For a semisimple Lie algebra, this representation is faithful (injective) because the center is trivial.

3. **Derivation Algebra**: The derivation algebra \(\text{Der}(L)\) consists of all linear maps \(D: L \to L\) satisfying the Leibniz rule. Inner derivations \(\text{Inn}(L)\) are those of the form \(\text{ad}(x)\) for \(x \in L\).

4. **Key Theorem**: For a semisimple Lie algebra, every derivation is inner. This means \(\text{Der}(L) = \text{Inn}(L)\). Since the adjoint representation is faithful, \(\text{Inn}(L)\) is isomorphic to \(L\), and thus \(\text{Der}(L)\) is isomorphic to \(L\) via the adjoint representation.

Given that the image of the adjoint representation (which is \(\text{Inn}(L)\)) is equal to the derivation algebra \(\text{Der}(L)\) for semisimple Lie algebras over \(\mathbb{C}\), the statement is true.

Reference Answer: Okay, let&#x27;s try to figure out whether the statement is true or false. The question is: &quot;A semisimple Lie algebra over the complex numbers always has the property that the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra.&quot; Hmm. Alright, let&#x27;s start by recalling some definitions and theorems related to semisimple Lie algebras, adjoint representations, and derivation algebras.

First, a semisimple Lie algebra is a Lie algebra that is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras, none of which are abelian. So, semisimple means no nontrivial solvable ideals, right? And over the complex numbers, these have been classified by Cartan and Killing, so they are well-understood.

The adjoint representation of a Lie algebra, denoted ad, is a map from the Lie algebra to its endomorphism algebra, defined by ad(x)(y) = [x, y]. The image of this map is the set of inner derivations. For a semisimple Lie algebra, I remember that the adjoint representation is faithful, which means that the map ad is injective. Since the Lie algebra is semisimple, its center is trivial, so the kernel of ad is zero. That tells us that the adjoint representation is an embedding of the Lie algebra into its derivation algebra.

Now, the derivation algebra, Der(L), of a Lie algebra L consists of all linear maps D: L → L such that D([x, y]) = [D(x), y] + [x, D(y)] for all x, y in L. Inner derivations are those of the form ad(x) for some x in L, and the set of inner derivations is denoted Inn(L). In general, Inn(L) is an ideal of Der(L).

The question is asking whether, for a semisimple Lie algebra over ℂ, we have that Inn(L) = Der(L). In other words, are all derivations inner?

I think that for semisimple Lie algebras, all derivations are inner. Wait, isn&#x27;t that a theorem? Let me recall. If a Lie algebra is semisimple, then every derivation is inner. Therefore, Der(L) = Inn(L). But Inn(L) is the image of the adjoint representation, which in this case is isomorphic to L since the adjoint representation is faithful. So then Der(L) ≅ L via the adjoint representation. Therefore, the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra. So the statement should be true?

But hold on, let me verify this. Let me check the standard results. In Humphrey&#x27;s Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory, Chapter II, Section 5, there&#x27;s a theorem (Theorem 5.3) that states that if L is a semisimple Lie algebra, then every derivation of L is inner; that is, ad(L) = Der(L). So that seems to confirm it. Therefore, the statement is true.

Wait, but let me double-check. Suppose L is semisimple, then Z(L) = 0, so ad is injective, hence ad(L) ≅ L. Then, since all derivations are inner, Der(L) = ad(L). Therefore, the adjoint representation (which is ad(L)) is equal to Der(L). Therefore, the answer should be true.

Wait, but let me double-check. Suppose L is semisimple, then Z(L) = 0, so ad is injective, hence ad(L) ≅ L. Then, since all derivations are inner, Der(L) = ad(L). Therefore, the adjoint representation (which is ad(L)) is equal to Der(L). Therefore, the answer should be true.

But maybe there is a subtlety here? For example, if the Lie algebra is not of adjoint type? Wait, no. The adjoint representation is a representation, not a type of Lie algebra. The adjoint representation is always a homomorphism into Der(L), and for semisimple Lie algebras, this is an isomorphism. So, over complex numbers, since L is semisimple, Der(L) is isomorphic to L via ad. Therefore, the statement is true.

Alternatively, maybe the confusion is between the adjoint representation and the derivation algebra as vector spaces? But the question says &quot;the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra&quot;. Wait, the adjoint representation is a homomorphism from L to End(L), and its image is ad(L) = Inn(L). So when the question says &quot;the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra&quot;, they probably mean that Inn(L) = Der(L). Since Inn(L) is the image of the adjoint representation, and Der(L) is the algebra of derivations.

Therefore, if Inn(L) = Der(L), then yes, the adjoint representation (its image) is equal to the derivation algebra. And since for semisimple Lie algebras, all derivations are inner, this equality holds. Therefore, the statement is true.

But let me check an example. Take sl(2, ℂ), which is a simple Lie algebra. Its derivations are all inner. So Der(sl(2, ℂ)) ≅ sl(2, ℂ) via the adjoint representation. Similarly, for any semisimple Lie algebra, this should hold. So, yes, the statement is true.

Wait, maybe the problem is with the wording? The question says &quot;the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra&quot;. But the adjoint representation is a Lie algebra homomorphism, while the derivation algebra is a Lie algebra. So strictly speaking, the adjoint representation is a map, and the derivation algebra is a Lie algebra. So perhaps the correct phrasing should be that the image of the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra. But in the context of Lie algebras, when people say &quot;the adjoint representation&quot;, sometimes they refer to the image, which is Inn(L). So maybe the question is using &quot;adjoint representation&quot; to mean Inn(L). Then, the question is whether Inn(L) = Der(L) for semisimple Lie algebras over ℂ. And the answer is yes, as per the theorem.

Therefore, the answer should be True.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{A}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the statement &quot;A semisimple Lie algebra over the complex numbers always has the property that the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra&quot; is true or false, we need to recall some key concepts and theorems related to semisimple Lie algebras, adjoint representations, and derivation algebras.

1. **Semisimple Lie Algebras**: A semisimple Lie algebra is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras, none of which are abelian. They have no nontrivial solvable ideals and a trivial center.

2. **Adjoint Representation**: The adjoint representation, denoted \(\text{ad}\), maps a Lie algebra \(L\) to its endomorphism algebra, defined by \(\text{ad}(x)(y) = [x, y]\). For a semisimple Lie algebra, this representation is faithful (injective) because the center is trivial.

3. **Derivation Algebra**: The derivation algebra \(\text{Der}(L)\) consists of all linear maps \(D: L \to L\) satisfying the Leibniz rule. Inner derivations \(\text{Inn}(L)\) are those of the form \(\text{ad}(x)\) for \(x \in L\).

4. **Key Theorem**: For a semisimple Lie algebra, every derivation is inner. This means \(\text{Der}(L) = \text{Inn}(L)\). Since the adjoint representation is faithful, \(\text{Inn}(L)\) is isomorphic to \(L\), and thus \(\text{Der}(L)\) is isomorphic to \(L\) via the adjoint representation.

Given that the image of the adjoint representation (which is \(\text{Inn}(L)\)) is equal to the derivation algebra \(\text{Der}(L)\) for semisimple Lie algebras over \(\mathbb{C}\), the statement is true.

Reference Answer: Okay, let&#x27;s try to figure out whether the statement is true or false. The question is: &quot;A semisimple Lie algebra over the complex numbers always has the property that the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra.&quot; Hmm. Alright, let&#x27;s start by recalling some definitions and theorems related to semisimple Lie algebras, adjoint representations, and derivation algebras.

First, a semisimple Lie algebra is a Lie algebra that is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras, none of which are abelian. So, semisimple means no nontrivial solvable ideals, right? And over the complex numbers, these have been classified by Cartan and Killing, so they are well-understood.

The adjoint representation of a Lie algebra, denoted ad, is a map from the Lie algebra to its endomorphism algebra, defined by ad(x)(y) = [x, y]. The image of this map is the set of inner derivations. For a semisimple Lie algebra, I remember that the adjoint representation is faithful, which means that the map ad is injective. Since the Lie algebra is semisimple, its center is trivial, so the kernel of ad is zero. That tells us that the adjoint representation is an embedding of the Lie algebra into its derivation algebra.

Now, the derivation algebra, Der(L), of a Lie algebra L consists of all linear maps D: L → L such that D([x, y]) = [D(x), y] + [x, D(y)] for all x, y in L. Inner derivations are those of the form ad(x) for some x in L, and the set of inner derivations is denoted Inn(L). In general, Inn(L) is an ideal of Der(L).

The question is asking whether, for a semisimple Lie algebra over ℂ, we have that Inn(L) = Der(L). In other words, are all derivations inner?

I think that for semisimple Lie algebras, all derivations are inner. Wait, isn&#x27;t that a theorem? Let me recall. If a Lie algebra is semisimple, then every derivation is inner. Therefore, Der(L) = Inn(L). But Inn(L) is the image of the adjoint representation, which in this case is isomorphic to L since the adjoint representation is faithful. So then Der(L) ≅ L via the adjoint representation. Therefore, the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra. So the statement should be true?

But hold on, let me verify this. Let me check the standard results. In Humphrey&#x27;s Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory, Chapter II, Section 5, there&#x27;s a theorem (Theorem 5.3) that states that if L is a semisimple Lie algebra, then every derivation of L is inner; that is, ad(L) = Der(L).

In Humphrey&#x27;s Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory, Chapter II, Section 5, there&#x27;s a theorem (Theorem 5.3) that states that if L is a semisimple Lie algebra, then every derivation of L is inner; that is, ad(L) = Der(L). So that seems to confirm it. Therefore, the statement is true.

Wait, but let me double-check. Suppose L is semisimple, then Z(L) = 0, so ad is injective, hence ad(L) ≅ L. Then, since all derivations are inner, Der(L) = ad(L). Therefore, the adjoint representation (which is ad(L)) is equal to Der(L). Therefore, the answer should be true.

But maybe there is a subtlety here? For example, if the Lie algebra is not of adjoint type? Wait, no. The adjoint representation is a representation, not a type of Lie algebra. The adjoint representation is always a homomorphism into Der(L), and for semisimple Lie algebras, this is an isomorphism. So, over complex numbers, since L is semisimple, Der(L) is isomorphic to L via ad. Therefore, the statement is true.

Alternatively, maybe the confusion is between the adjoint representation and the derivation algebra as vector spaces? But the question says &quot;the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra&quot;. Wait, the adjoint representation is a homomorphism from L to End(L), and its image is ad(L) = Inn(L). So when the question says &quot;the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra&quot;, they probably mean that Inn(L) = Der(L). Since Inn(L) is the image of the adjoint representation, and Der(L) is the algebra of derivations.

Therefore, if Inn(L) = Der(L), then yes, the adjoint representation (its image) is equal to the derivation algebra. And since for semisimple Lie algebras, all derivations are inner, this equality holds. Therefore, the statement is true.

But let me check an example. Take sl(2, ℂ), which is a simple Lie algebra. Its derivations are all inner. So Der(sl(2, ℂ)) ≅ sl(2, ℂ) via the adjoint representation. Similarly, for any semisimple Lie algebra, this should hold. So, yes, the statement is true.

Wait, maybe the problem is with the wording? The question says &quot;the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra&quot;. But the adjoint representation is a Lie algebra homomorphism, while the derivation algebra is a Lie algebra. So strictly speaking, the adjoint representation is a map, and the derivation algebra is a Lie algebra. So perhaps the correct phrasing should be that the image of the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra. But in the context of Lie algebras, when people say &quot;the adjoint representation&quot;, sometimes they refer to the image, which is Inn(L). So maybe the question is using &quot;adjoint representation&quot; to mean Inn(L). Then, the question is whether Inn(L) = Der(L) for semisimple Lie algebras over ℂ. And the answer is yes, as per the theorem.

Therefore, the answer should be True.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{A}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the statement &quot;A semisimple Lie algebra over the complex numbers always has the property that the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra&quot; is true or false, we need to recall some key concepts and theorems related to semisimple Lie algebras, adjoint representations, and derivation algebras.

1. **Semisimple Lie Algebras**: A semisimple Lie algebra is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras, none of which are abelian. They have no nontrivial solvable ideals and a trivial center.

2. **Adjoint Representation**: The adjoint representation, denoted \(\text{ad}\), maps a Lie algebra \(L\) to its endomorphism algebra, defined by \(\text{ad}(x)(y) = [x, y]\). For a semisimple Lie algebra, this representation is faithful (injective) because the center is trivial.

3. **Derivation Algebra**: The derivation algebra \(\text{Der}(L)\) consists of all linear maps \(D: L \to L\) satisfying the Leibniz rule. Inner derivations \(\text{Inn}(L)\) are those of the form \(\text{ad}(x)\) for \(x \in L\).

4. **Key Theorem**: For a semisimple Lie algebra, every derivation is inner. This means \(\text{Der}(L) = \text{Inn}(L)\). Since the adjoint representation is faithful, \(\text{Inn}(L)\) is isomorphic to \(L\), and thus \(\text{Der}(L)\) is isomorphic to \(L\) via the adjoint representation.

Given that the image of the adjoint representation (which is \(\text{Inn}(L)\)) is equal to the derivation algebra \(\text{Der}(L)\) for semisimple Lie algebras over \(\mathbb{C}\), the statement is true.

Reference Answer: Okay, let&#x27;s try to figure out whether the statement is true or false. The question is: &quot;A semisimple Lie algebra over the complex numbers always has the property that the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra.&quot; Hmm. Alright, let&#x27;s start by recalling some definitions and theorems related to semisimple Lie algebras, adjoint representations, and derivation algebras.

First, a semisimple Lie algebra is a Lie algebra that is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras, none of which are abelian. So, semisimple means no nontrivial solvable ideals, right? And over the complex numbers, these have been classified by Cartan and Killing, so they are well-understood.

The adjoint representation of a Lie algebra, denoted ad, is a map from the Lie algebra to its endomorphism algebra, defined by ad(x)(y) = [x, y]. The image of this map is the set of inner derivations. For a semisimple Lie algebra, I remember that the adjoint representation is faithful, which means that the map ad is injective. Since the Lie algebra is semisimple, its center is trivial, so the kernel of ad is zero. That tells us that the adjoint representation is an embedding of the Lie algebra into its derivation algebra.

Now, the derivation algebra, Der(L), of a Lie algebra L consists of all linear maps D: L → L such that D([x, y]) = [D(x), y] + [x, D(y)] for all x, y in L. Inner derivations are those of the form ad(x) for some x in L, and the set of inner derivations is denoted Inn(L). In general, Inn(L) is an ideal of Der(L).

The question is asking whether, for a semisimple Lie algebra over ℂ, we have that Inn(L) = Der(L). In other words, are all derivations inner?

I think that for semisimple Lie algebras, all derivations are inner. Wait, isn&#x27;t that a theorem? Let me recall. If a Lie algebra is semisimple, then every derivation is inner. Therefore, Der(L) = Inn(L). But Inn(L) is the image of the adjoint representation, which in this case is isomorphic to L since the adjoint representation is faithful. So then Der(L) ≅ L via the adjoint representation. Therefore, the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra. So the statement should be true?

So then Der(L) ≅ L via the adjoint representation. Therefore, the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra. So the statement should be true?

But hold on, let me verify this. Let me check the standard results. In Humphrey&#x27;s Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory, Chapter II, Section 5, there&#x27;s a theorem (Theorem 5.3) that states that if L is a semisimple Lie algebra, then every derivation of L is inner; that is, ad(L) = Der(L). So that seems to confirm it. Therefore, the statement is true.

Wait, but let me double-check. Suppose L is semisimple, then Z(L) = 0, so ad is injective, hence ad(L) ≅ L. Then, since all derivations are inner, Der(L) = ad(L). Therefore, the adjoint representation (which is ad(L)) is equal to Der(L). Therefore, the answer should be true.

But maybe there is a subtlety here? For example, if the Lie algebra is not of adjoint type? Wait, no. The adjoint representation is a representation, not a type of Lie algebra. The adjoint representation is always a homomorphism into Der(L), and for semisimple Lie algebras, this is an isomorphism. So, over complex numbers, since L is semisimple, Der(L) is isomorphic to L via ad. Therefore, the statement is true.

Alternatively, maybe the confusion is between the adjoint representation and the derivation algebra as vector spaces? But the question says &quot;the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra&quot;. Wait, the adjoint representation is a homomorphism from L to End(L), and its image is ad(L) = Inn(L). So when the question says &quot;the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra&quot;, they probably mean that Inn(L) = Der(L). Since Inn(L) is the image of the adjoint representation, and Der(L) is the algebra of derivations.

Therefore, if Inn(L) = Der(L), then yes, the adjoint representation (its image) is equal to the derivation algebra. And since for semisimple Lie algebras, all derivations are inner, this equality holds. Therefore, the statement is true.

But let me check an example. Take sl(2, ℂ), which is a simple Lie algebra. Its derivations are all inner. So Der(sl(2, ℂ)) ≅ sl(2, ℂ) via the adjoint representation. Similarly, for any semisimple Lie algebra, this should hold. So, yes, the statement is true.

Wait, maybe the problem is with the wording? The question says &quot;the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra&quot;. But the adjoint representation is a Lie algebra homomorphism, while the derivation algebra is a Lie algebra. So strictly speaking, the adjoint representation is a map, and the derivation algebra is a Lie algebra. So perhaps the correct phrasing should be that the image of the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra. But in the context of Lie algebras, when people say &quot;the adjoint representation&quot;, sometimes they refer to the image, which is Inn(L). So maybe the question is using &quot;adjoint representation&quot; to mean Inn(L). Then, the question is whether Inn(L) = Der(L) for semisimple Lie algebras over ℂ. And the answer is yes, as per the theorem.

Therefore, the answer should be True.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{A}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether the statement &quot;A semisimple Lie algebra over the complex numbers always has the property that the adjoint representation is equal to the derivation algebra&quot; is true or false, we need to recall some key concepts and theorems related to semisimple Lie algebras, adjoint representations, and derivation algebras.

1. **Semisimple Lie Algebras**: A semisimple Lie algebra is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras, none of which are abelian. They have no nontrivial solvable ideals and a trivial center.

2. **Adjoint Representation**: The adjoint representation, denoted \(\text{ad}\), maps a Lie algebra \(L\) to its endomorphism algebra, defined by \(\text{ad}(x)(y) = [x, y]\). For a semisimple Lie algebra, this representation is faithful (injective) because the center is trivial.

3. **Derivation Algebra**: The derivation algebra \(\text{Der}(L)\) consists of all linear maps \(D: L \to L\) satisfying the Leibniz rule. Inner derivations \(\text{Inn}(L)\) are those of the form \(\text{ad}(x)\) for \(x \in L\).

4. **Key Theorem**: For a semisimple Lie algebra, every derivation is inner. This means \(\text{Der}(L) = \text{Inn}(L)\). Since the adjoint representation is faithful, \(\text{Inn}(L)\) is isomorphic to \(L\), and thus \(\text{Der}(L)\) is isomorphic to \(L\) via the adjoint representation.

Given that the image of the adjoint representation (which is \(\text{Inn}(L)\)) is equal to the derivation algebra \(\text{Der}(L)\) for semisimple Lie algebras over \(\mathbb{C}\), the statement is true.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the probability that the minimum number of uniform random variables needed to exceed a certain threshold x is greater than k. In other words, P(M &gt; k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is still less than or equal to x. That makes sense because M is the first time the sum exceeds x, so if even after k variables the sum hasn&#x27;t exceeded x, then M must be greater than k.

Since each Xi is uniformly distributed on [0,1], their sum would follow some distribution. For independent uniform variables, the sum of n such variables is known to have an Irwin–Hall distribution. The probability that the sum of n uniform variables is less than or equal to x is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution. 

Wait, but the problem states that the variables are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform on [0,1], so the sum S_k = X1 + X2 + ... + Xk has a Irwin–Hall distribution. The CDF of S_k is given by:

P(S_k ≤ x) = (1/k!) * Σ_{i=0}^floor(x) (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (x - i)^k

But since x is between 0 and 1, and we are summing k variables each between 0 and 1, if x is in [0,1], then the sum S_k can range from 0 to k. However, if x is between 0 and 1, then floor(x) is 0 when x &lt; 1. Wait, hold on. Wait, x is a constant between 0 and 1, given. So we need the probability that the sum of k uniform variables is ≤ x. But each variable is at least 0, so the sum S_k is at least 0. But x is less than 1. So if we have k variables each at most 1, their sum can be up to k, but we are interested in the case where their sum is ≤ x &lt; 1.

But wait, if x is less than 1, then the maximum possible sum for k variables is k, but x is less than 1. So the event S_k ≤ x is equivalent to all variables being ≤ x and their sum ≤ x. Wait, no, that&#x27;s not necessarily the case. For example, if one variable is close to x and the others are zero, the sum can still be ≤ x. So actually, the event S_k ≤ x is the same as the sum of k non-negative numbers each ≤1 adding up to ≤x. Since x &lt; 1, all the variables must add up to something less than 1. 

But the variables are independent, so how do we compute the probability that their sum is ≤x? For x in [0,1], the volume of the k-dimensional simplex where each xi ≥0 and x1 + x2 + ... + xk ≤x. The volume of that region is x^k /k! . Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the volume (which corresponds to the probability since the variables are uniform) of the set {(x1, x2, ..., xk) ∈ [0,1]^k : x1 + ... + xk ≤x} is equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with edge length x, but constrained by each variable being at most 1. However, since x &lt;1 and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, the constraints xi ≤1 are automatically satisfied because each xi is non-negative and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, so each xi must be ≤x &lt;1. Therefore, the volume is indeed equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with side length x, which is x^k /k!.

So then, P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k! ?

Wait, but I thought the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution for n variables at x is (1/n!) Σ_{k=0}^floor(x)} (-1)^k C(n, k) (x -k)^n. But if x is in [0,1), then floor(x) =0, so the sum reduces to (1/n!)(x^n). So yes, in that case, P(S_n ≤x) = x^n /n!.

Wait, that seems right. So for example, when n=1, P(S_1 ≤x) = x, which is correct because X1 is uniform on [0,1]. For n=2, P(S_2 ≤x) = x^2 /2, which makes sense because the area under the line x1 + x2 =x in the unit square is a triangle with area x^2 /2. Similarly, for n=3, it&#x27;s a tetrahedron with volume x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!.

Therefore, in general, for x in [0,1), P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Therefore, since P(M &gt;k) = P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify with k=1. For k=1, P(M &gt;1) = P(X1 ≤x) = x, which matches x^1 /1! =x. For k=2, P(M&gt;2)=P(X1 + X2 ≤x). Since X1 and X2 are both uniform on [0,1], the probability that their sum is ≤x is the area of the triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,x), and (x,0). The area is (x^2)/2, which is x^2 /2! as per the formula. Similarly for k=3, it&#x27;s x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!. So yes, that seems to hold.

Therefore, the general formula for P(M&gt;k) when 0 &lt;x &lt;1 is x^k /k!.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose x is very close to 1, say x=0.99. Then for k=1, the probability is 0.99. For k=2, the probability that X1 + X2 ≤0.99 is 0.99^2 /2 ≈0.490, which is correct because the area under the line X1 + X2 =0.99 in the unit square is a triangle with area (0.99)^2 /2. But wait, 0.99^2 is approximately 0.98, so divided by 2 is 0.49, which is correct. If we compute the integral of the joint PDF over X1 + X2 ≤0.99, since X1 and X2 are independent uniform variables, the joint PDF is 1 over [0,1]^2. So integrating over X1 from 0 to 0.99, X2 from 0 to 0.99 - X1, which gives the area 0.99^2 /2. So that works.

Therefore, the formula holds for x in [0,1]. But wait, actually, the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution when x is in [0,1] is indeed x^k /k!.

So, given that, then P(M&gt;k) = x^k /k!.

But wait, let me check a different case. Suppose x=0.5 and k=3. Then P(M&gt;3) would be the probability that the sum of three uniforms is ≤0.5. The volume of the set {(x1, x2, x3) ∈ [0,1]^3 : x1 +x2 +x3 ≤0.5} is a tetrahedron with edge length 0.5, so its volume is (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208. Which is correct because integrating over x1 from 0 to 0.5, then x2 from 0 to 0.5 -x1, then x3 from 0 to 0.5 -x1 -x2. The triple integral would be:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1 -x2} dx3 dx2 dx1.

Which is equal to ∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2 dx1.

Let’s compute the inner integral:

∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2.

Let’s substitute u =0.5 -x1 -x2, then when x2=0, u=0.5 -x1, and when x2=0.5 -x1, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫_{u=0.5 -x1}^{0} u (-du) = ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} u du = [ (u^2)/2 ] from 0 to 0.5 -x1 = ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2.

Then the next integral is:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2 dx1.

Let’s substitute v=0.5 -x1, so when x1=0, v=0.5, and when x1=0.5, v=0. The integral becomes:

∫_{v=0.5}^{0} (v^2)/2 (-dv) = ∫_{0}^{0.5} (v^2)/2 dv = [ (v^3)/6 ] from 0 to 0.5 = (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208.

Which matches (0.5)^3 /3! =1/48. So that works. Therefore, the formula holds.

Therefore, the answer is P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. The question says &quot;non-negative integer k&quot;. So k can be zero? Let&#x27;s check.

If k=0, then P(M&gt;0) is the probability that M&gt;0. But M is defined as the minimum n≥1 such that the sum exceeds x. So M is always at least 1, because n starts at 1. Therefore, P(M&gt;0) should be 1, since M&gt;0 is always true. Let&#x27;s check the formula: x^0 /0! =1 /1=1. Correct.

For k=1, P(M&gt;1)=x /1 =x, which is correct as we saw earlier. So the formula works for k=0 as well.

Therefore, the general formula is P(M&gt;k) =x^k /k! for non-negative integers k, where 0 &lt;x &lt;1.

But wait, hold on. Let me check for k=2 and x=1. But x is strictly less than 1. The problem states 0 &lt;x &lt;1, so x=1 is excluded. But if x approaches 1, then P(M&gt;k) approaches 1^k /k! =1/k!.

But if x approaches 1, the probability that the sum of k uniforms is less than 1. However, for x=1 and k=2, the probability that the sum of two uniforms is less than 1 is 1/2, which is 1^2 /2!=1/2. Which is correct. Similarly, for k=3, x approaching 1, the probability approaches 1/6, which is correct.

Therefore, the formula holds even when x approaches 1, but since x is strictly less than 1, we don&#x27;t have to worry about the cases where x ≥1.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k) = \dfrac{x^k}{k!} for each non-negative integer k.

Wait, but I want to confirm once more.

Alternative approach: Let&#x27;s use recursion or generating functions. Let’s denote that P(M &gt;k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is ≤x. Let’s denote this probability as P_k(x). Then, for k=0, we have P_0(x)=1, since the sum of zero variables is 0, which is ≤x for x&gt;0. For k=1, P_1(x)=P(X1 ≤x)=x. For k=2, P_2(x)=P(X1 +X2 ≤x). As we saw, this is x^2 /2. Then, in general, P_k(x) = integral from 0 to x of P_{k-1}(x -t) dt, where t is the value of Xk. Since each Xi is uniform, the PDF of Xk is 1 on [0,1]. Therefore, P_k(x) = ∫_{0}^{x} P_{k-1}(x -t) dt.

Starting with P_0(x)=1, then:

P_1(x) = ∫_{0}^x P_0(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x 1 dt =x.

P_2(x)=∫_{0}^x P_1(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t) dt = [x t - t^2 /2 ] from 0 tox =x^2 -x^2 /2 =x^2 /2.

Similarly, P_3(x)=∫_{0}^x P_2(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 /2 dt = (1/2) ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 dt = (1/2)[ -(x -t)^3 /3 ] from 0 tox = (1/2)(x^3 /3 )=x^3 /6.

Continuing this way, we can see that P_k(x)=x^k /k!.

Therefore, by induction, if P_{k-1}(x)=x^{k-1}/(k-1)!, then P_k(x)=∫0^x t^{k-1}/(k-1)! dt =x^k /k!.

Hence, the formula holds. Therefore, the probability that M&gt;k is x^k /k!.

Yes, that seems to check out through induction as well.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

**Final Answer**
The probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is \boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \), we need to determine the probability that the sum of the first \( k \) uniform random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k \) on \([0, 1]\) is less than or equal to \( x \). This is equivalent to finding the probability that the minimum number \( M \) of variables needed to exceed \( x \) is greater than \( k \).

The sum \( S_k = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_k \) of \( k \) independent uniform random variables on \([0, 1]\) follows the Irwin–Hall distribution. For \( 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \), the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution simplifies to the volume of the \( k \)-dimensional simplex where each coordinate is non-negative and their sum is less than or equal to \( x \). This volume is given by \( \frac{x^k}{k!} \).

We can verify this result through induction:
- For \( k = 0 \), \( P(M &gt; 0) = 1 \), which matches \( \frac{x^0}{0!} = 1 \).
- For \( k = 1 \), \( P(M &gt; 1) = P(X_1 \leq x) = x \), which matches \( \frac{x^1}{1!} = x \).
- For \( k = 2 \), the probability that \( X_1 + X_2 \leq x \) is the area of a triangle with vertices \((0, 0)\), \((x, 0)\), and \((0, x)\), which is \( \frac{x^2}{2} \), matching \( \frac{x^2}{2!} \).

By induction, assuming \( P_{k-1}(x) = \frac{x^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \), we have:
\[ P_k(x) = \int_0^x P_{k-1}(x - t) \, dt = \int_0^x \frac{(x - t)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \, dt = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

Thus, the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is given by:
\[ P(M &gt; k) = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the probability that the minimum number of uniform random variables needed to exceed a certain threshold x is greater than k. In other words, P(M &gt; k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is still less than or equal to x. That makes sense because M is the first time the sum exceeds x, so if even after k variables the sum hasn&#x27;t exceeded x, then M must be greater than k.

Since each Xi is uniformly distributed on [0,1], their sum would follow some distribution. For independent uniform variables, the sum of n such variables is known to have an Irwin–Hall distribution. The probability that the sum of n uniform variables is less than or equal to x is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution. 

Wait, but the problem states that the variables are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform on [0,1], so the sum S_k = X1 + X2 + ... + Xk has a Irwin–Hall distribution. The CDF of S_k is given by:

P(S_k ≤ x) = (1/k!) * Σ_{i=0}^floor(x) (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (x - i)^k

But since x is between 0 and 1, and we are summing k variables each between 0 and 1, if x is in [0,1], then the sum S_k can range from 0 to k. However, if x is between 0 and 1, then floor(x) is 0 when x &lt; 1. Wait, hold on. Wait, x is a constant between 0 and 1, given. So we need the probability that the sum of k uniform variables is ≤ x. But each variable is at least 0, so the sum S_k is at least 0. But x is less than 1. So if we have k variables each at most 1, their sum can be up to k, but we are interested in the case where their sum is ≤ x &lt; 1.

But wait, if x is less than 1, then the maximum possible sum for k variables is k, but x is less than 1. So the event S_k ≤ x is equivalent to all variables being ≤ x and their sum ≤ x. Wait, no, that&#x27;s not necessarily the case. For example, if one variable is close to x and the others are zero, the sum can still be ≤ x. So actually, the event S_k ≤ x is the same as the sum of k non-negative numbers each ≤1 adding up to ≤x. Since x &lt; 1, all the variables must add up to something less than 1. 

But the variables are independent, so how do we compute the probability that their sum is ≤x? For x in [0,1], the volume of the k-dimensional simplex where each xi ≥0 and x1 + x2 + ... + xk ≤x. The volume of that region is x^k /k! . Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the volume (which corresponds to the probability since the variables are uniform) of the set {(x1, x2, ..., xk) ∈ [0,1]^k : x1 + ... + xk ≤x} is equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with edge length x, but constrained by each variable being at most 1. However, since x &lt;1 and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, the constraints xi ≤1 are automatically satisfied because each xi is non-negative and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, so each xi must be ≤x &lt;1. Therefore, the volume is indeed equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with side length x, which is x^k /k!.

So then, P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k! ?

Wait, but I thought the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution for n variables at x is (1/n!) Σ_{k=0}^floor(x)} (-1)^k C(n, k) (x -k)^n. But if x is in [0,1), then floor(x) =0, so the sum reduces to (1/n!)(x^n). So yes, in that case, P(S_n ≤x) = x^n /n!.

Wait, that seems right. So for example, when n=1, P(S_1 ≤x) = x, which is correct because X1 is uniform on [0,1]. For n=2, P(S_2 ≤x) = x^2 /2, which makes sense because the area under the line x1 + x2 =x in the unit square is a triangle with area x^2 /2. Similarly, for n=3, it&#x27;s a tetrahedron with volume x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!.

Therefore, in general, for x in [0,1), P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Therefore, since P(M &gt;k) = P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify with k=1. For k=1, P(M &gt;1) = P(X1 ≤x) = x, which matches x^1 /1! =x. For k=2, P(M&gt;2)=P(X1 + X2 ≤x). Since X1 and X2 are both uniform on [0,1], the probability that their sum is ≤x is the area of the triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,x), and (x,0). The area is (x^2)/2, which is x^2 /2! as per the formula. Similarly for k=3, it&#x27;s x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!. So yes, that seems to hold.

Therefore, the general formula for P(M&gt;k) when 0 &lt;x &lt;1 is x^k /k!.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose x is very close to 1, say x=0.99. Then for k=1, the probability is 0.99. For k=2, the probability that X1 + X2 ≤0.99 is 0.99^2 /2 ≈0.490, which is correct because the area under the line X1 + X2 =0.99 in the unit square is a triangle with area (0.99)^2 /2. But wait, 0.99^2 is approximately 0.98, so divided by 2 is 0.49, which is correct. If we compute the integral of the joint PDF over X1 + X2 ≤0.99, since X1 and X2 are independent uniform variables, the joint PDF is 1 over [0,1]^2. So integrating over X1 from 0 to 0.99, X2 from 0 to 0.99 - X1, which gives the area 0.99^2 /2. So that works.

Therefore, the formula holds for x in [0,1]. But wait, actually, the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution when x is in [0,1] is indeed x^k /k!.

So, given that, then P(M&gt;k) = x^k /k!.

But wait, let me check a different case. Suppose x=0.5 and k=3. Then P(M&gt;3) would be the probability that the sum of three uniforms is ≤0.5. The volume of the set {(x1, x2, x3) ∈ [0,1]^3 : x1 +x2 +x3 ≤0.5} is a tetrahedron with edge length 0.5, so its volume is (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208. Which is correct because integrating over x1 from 0 to 0.5, then x2 from 0 to 0.5 -x1, then x3 from 0 to 0.5 -x1 -x2. The triple integral would be:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1 -x2} dx3 dx2 dx1.

Which is equal to ∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2 dx1.

Let’s compute the inner integral:

∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2.

Let’s substitute u =0.5 -x1 -x2, then when x2=0, u=0.5 -x1, and when x2=0.5 -x1, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫_{u=0.5 -x1}^{0} u (-du) = ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} u du = [ (u^2)/2 ] from 0 to 0.5 -x1 = ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2.

Then the next integral is:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2 dx1.

Let’s substitute v=0.5 -x1, so when x1=0, v=0.5, and when x1=0.5, v=0. The integral becomes:

∫_{v=0.5}^{0} (v^2)/2 (-dv) = ∫_{0}^{0.5} (v^2)/2 dv = [ (v^3)/6 ] from 0 to 0.5 = (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208.

Which matches (0.5)^3 /3! =1/48. So that works. Therefore, the formula holds.

Therefore, the answer is P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. The question says &quot;non-negative integer k&quot;. So k can be zero? Let&#x27;s check.

If k=0, then P(M&gt;0) is the probability that M&gt;0. But M is defined as the minimum n≥1 such that the sum exceeds x. So M is always at least 1, because n starts at 1. Therefore, P(M&gt;0) should be 1, since M&gt;0 is always true. Let&#x27;s check the formula: x^0 /0! =1 /1=1. Correct.

For k=1, P(M&gt;1)=x /1 =x, which is correct as we saw earlier. So the formula works for k=0 as well.

Therefore, the general formula is P(M&gt;k) =x^k /k! for non-negative integers k, where 0 &lt;x &lt;1.

But wait, hold on. Let me check for k=2 and x=1. But x is strictly less than 1. The problem states 0 &lt;x &lt;1, so x=1 is excluded. But if x approaches 1, then P(M&gt;k) approaches 1^k /k! =1/k!.

But if x approaches 1, the probability that the sum of k uniforms is less than 1. However, for x=1 and k=2, the probability that the sum of two uniforms is less than 1 is 1/2, which is 1^2 /2!=1/2. Which is correct. Similarly, for k=3, x approaching 1, the probability approaches 1/6, which is correct.

Therefore, the formula holds even when x approaches 1, but since x is strictly less than 1, we don&#x27;t have to worry about the cases where x ≥1.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k) = \dfrac{x^k}{k!} for each non-negative integer k.

Wait, but I want to confirm once more.

Alternative approach: Let&#x27;s use recursion or generating functions. Let’s denote that P(M &gt;k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is ≤x. Let’s denote this probability as P_k(x). Then, for k=0, we have P_0(x)=1, since the sum of zero variables is 0, which is ≤x for x&gt;0. For k=1, P_1(x)=P(X1 ≤x)=x. For k=2, P_2(x)=P(X1 +X2 ≤x). As we saw, this is x^2 /2. Then, in general, P_k(x) = integral from 0 to x of P_{k-1}(x -t) dt, where t is the value of Xk. Since each Xi is uniform, the PDF of Xk is 1 on [0,1]. Therefore, P_k(x) = ∫_{0}^{x} P_{k-1}(x -t) dt.

Starting with P_0(x)=1, then:

P_1(x) = ∫_{0}^x P_0(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x 1 dt =x.

P_2(x)=∫_{0}^x P_1(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t) dt = [x t - t^2 /2 ] from 0 tox =x^2 -x^2 /2 =x^2 /2.

Similarly, P_3(x)=∫_{0}^x P_2(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 /2 dt = (1/2) ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 dt = (1/2)[ -(x -t)^3 /3 ] from 0 tox = (1/2)(x^3 /3 )=x^3 /6.

Continuing this way, we can see that P_k(x)=x^k /k!.

Therefore, by induction, if P_{k-1}(x)=x^{k-1}/(k-1)!, then P_k(x)=∫0^x t^{k-1}/(k-1)! dt =x^k /k!.

Hence, the formula holds. Therefore, the probability that M&gt;k is x^k /k!.

Yes, that seems to check out through induction as well.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

**Final Answer**
The probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is \boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \), we need to determine the probability that the sum of the first \( k \) uniform random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k \) on \([0, 1]\) is less than or equal to \( x \). This is equivalent to finding the probability that the minimum number \( M \) of variables needed to exceed \( x \) is greater than \( k \).

The sum \( S_k = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_k \) of \( k \) independent uniform random variables on \([0, 1]\) follows the Irwin–Hall distribution. For \( 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \), the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution simplifies to the volume of the \( k \)-dimensional simplex where each coordinate is non-negative and their sum is less than or equal to \( x \). This volume is given by \( \frac{x^k}{k!} \).

We can verify this result through induction:
- For \( k = 0 \), \( P(M &gt; 0) = 1 \), which matches \( \frac{x^0}{0!} = 1 \).
- For \( k = 1 \), \( P(M &gt; 1) = P(X_1 \leq x) = x \), which matches \( \frac{x^1}{1!} = x \).
- For \( k = 2 \), the probability that \( X_1 + X_2 \leq x \) is the area of a triangle with vertices \((0, 0)\), \((x, 0)\), and \((0, x)\), which is \( \frac{x^2}{2} \), matching \( \frac{x^2}{2!} \).

By induction, assuming \( P_{k-1}(x) = \frac{x^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \), we have:
\[ P_k(x) = \int_0^x P_{k-1}(x - t) \, dt = \int_0^x \frac{(x - t)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \, dt = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

Thus, the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is given by:
\[ P(M &gt; k) = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the probability that the minimum number of uniform random variables needed to exceed a certain threshold x is greater than k. In other words, P(M &gt; k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is still less than or equal to x. That makes sense because M is the first time the sum exceeds x, so if even after k variables the sum hasn&#x27;t exceeded x, then M must be greater than k.

Since each Xi is uniformly distributed on [0,1], their sum would follow some distribution. For independent uniform variables, the sum of n such variables is known to have an Irwin–Hall distribution. The probability that the sum of n uniform variables is less than or equal to x is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution. 

Wait, but the problem states that the variables are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform on [0,1], so the sum S_k = X1 + X2 + ... + Xk has a Irwin–Hall distribution. The CDF of S_k is given by:

P(S_k ≤ x) = (1/k!) * Σ_{i=0}^floor(x) (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (x - i)^k

But since x is between 0 and 1, and we are summing k variables each between 0 and 1, if x is in [0,1], then the sum S_k can range from 0 to k. However, if x is between 0 and 1, then floor(x) is 0 when x &lt; 1. Wait, hold on. Wait, x is a constant between 0 and 1, given. So we need the probability that the sum of k uniform variables is ≤ x. But each variable is at least 0, so the sum S_k is at least 0. But x is less than 1. So if we have k variables each at most 1, their sum can be up to k, but we are interested in the case where their sum is ≤ x &lt; 1.

But wait, if x is less than 1, then the maximum possible sum for k variables is k, but x is less than 1. So the event S_k ≤ x is equivalent to all variables being ≤ x and their sum ≤ x. Wait, no, that&#x27;s not necessarily the case. For example, if one variable is close to x and the others are zero, the sum can still be ≤ x. So actually, the event S_k ≤ x is the same as the sum of k non-negative numbers each ≤1 adding up to ≤x. Since x &lt; 1, all the variables must add up to something less than 1. 

But the variables are independent, so how do we compute the probability that their sum is ≤x? For x in [0,1], the volume of the k-dimensional simplex where each xi ≥0 and x1 + x2 + ... + xk ≤x. The volume of that region is x^k /k! . Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the volume (which corresponds to the probability since the variables are uniform) of the set {(x1, x2, ..., xk) ∈ [0,1]^k : x1 + ... + xk ≤x} is equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with edge length x, but constrained by each variable being at most 1. However, since x &lt;1 and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, the constraints xi ≤1 are automatically satisfied because each xi is non-negative and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, so each xi must be ≤x &lt;1. Therefore, the volume is indeed equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with side length x, which is x^k /k!.

So then, P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k! ?

Wait, but I thought the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution for n variables at x is (1/n!) Σ_{k=0}^floor(x)} (-1)^k C(n, k) (x -k)^n. But if x is in [0,1), then floor(x) =0, so the sum reduces to (1/n!)(x^n). So yes, in that case, P(S_n ≤x) = x^n /n!.

Wait, that seems right. So for example, when n=1, P(S_1 ≤x) = x, which is correct because X1 is uniform on [0,1]. For n=2, P(S_2 ≤x) = x^2 /2, which makes sense because the area under the line x1 + x2 =x in the unit square is a triangle with area x^2 /2. Similarly, for n=3, it&#x27;s a tetrahedron with volume x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!.

Therefore, in general, for x in [0,1), P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Therefore, since P(M &gt;k) = P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify with k=1. For k=1, P(M &gt;1) = P(X1 ≤x) = x, which matches x^1 /1! =x. For k=2, P(M&gt;2)=P(X1 + X2 ≤x). Since X1 and X2 are both uniform on [0,1], the probability that their sum is ≤x is the area of the triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,x), and (x,0). The area is (x^2)/2, which is x^2 /2! as per the formula. Similarly for k=3, it&#x27;s x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!. So yes, that seems to hold.

Therefore, the general formula for P(M&gt;k) when 0 &lt;x &lt;1 is x^k /k!.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose x is very close to 1, say x=0.99. Then for k=1, the probability is 0.99. For k=2, the probability that X1 + X2 ≤0.99 is 0.99^2 /2 ≈0.490, which is correct because the area under the line X1 + X2 =0.99 in the unit square is a triangle with area (0.99)^2 /2. But wait, 0.99^2 is approximately 0.98, so divided by 2 is 0.49, which is correct. If we compute the integral of the joint PDF over X1 + X2 ≤0.99, since X1 and X2 are independent uniform variables, the joint PDF is 1 over [0,1]^2. So integrating over X1 from 0 to 0.99, X2 from 0 to 0.99 - X1, which gives the area 0.99^2 /2. So that works.

Therefore, the formula holds for x in [0,1]. But wait, actually, the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution when x is in [0,1] is indeed x^k /k!.

So, given that, then P(M&gt;k) = x^k /k!.

But wait, let me check a different case. Suppose x=0.5 and k=3. Then P(M&gt;3) would be the probability that the sum of three uniforms is ≤0.5. The volume of the set {(x1, x2, x3) ∈ [0,1]^3 : x1 +x2 +x3 ≤0.5} is a tetrahedron with edge length 0.5, so its volume is (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208. Which is correct because integrating over x1 from 0 to 0.5, then x2 from 0 to 0.5 -x1, then x3 from 0 to 0.5 -x1 -x2. The triple integral would be:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1 -x2} dx3 dx2 dx1.

Which is equal to ∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2 dx1.

Let’s compute the inner integral:

∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2.

Let’s substitute u =0.5 -x1 -x2, then when x2=0, u=0.5 -x1, and when x2=0.5 -x1, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫_{u=0.5 -x1}^{0} u (-du) = ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} u du = [ (u^2)/2 ] from 0 to 0.5 -x1 = ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2.

Then the next integral is:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2 dx1.

Let’s substitute v=0.5 -x1, so when x1=0, v=0.5, and when x1=0.5, v=0. The integral becomes:

∫_{v=0.5}^{0} (v^2)/2 (-dv) = ∫_{0}^{0.5} (v^2)/2 dv = [ (v^3)/6 ] from 0 to 0.5 = (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208.

Which matches (0.5)^3 /3! =1/48. So that works. Therefore, the formula holds.

Therefore, the answer is P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. The question says &quot;non-negative integer k&quot;. So k can be zero? Let&#x27;s check.

If k=0, then P(M&gt;0) is the probability that M&gt;0. But M is defined as the minimum n≥1 such that the sum exceeds x. So M is always at least 1, because n starts at 1. Therefore, P(M&gt;0) should be 1, since M&gt;0 is always true. Let&#x27;s check the formula: x^0 /0! =1 /1=1. Correct.

For k=1, P(M&gt;1)=x /1 =x, which is correct as we saw earlier. So the formula works for k=0 as well.

Therefore, the general formula is P(M&gt;k) =x^k /k! for non-negative integers k, where 0 &lt;x &lt;1.

But wait, hold on. Let me check for k=2 and x=1. But x is strictly less than 1. The problem states 0 &lt;x &lt;1, so x=1 is excluded. But if x approaches 1, then P(M&gt;k) approaches 1^k /k! =1/k!.

But if x approaches 1, the probability that the sum of k uniforms is less than 1. However, for x=1 and k=2, the probability that the sum of two uniforms is less than 1 is 1/2, which is 1^2 /2!=1/2. Which is correct. Similarly, for k=3, x approaching 1, the probability approaches 1/6, which is correct.

Therefore, the formula holds even when x approaches 1, but since x is strictly less than 1, we don&#x27;t have to worry about the cases where x ≥1.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k) = \dfrac{x^k}{k!} for each non-negative integer k.

Wait, but I want to confirm once more.

Alternative approach: Let&#x27;s use recursion or generating functions. Let’s denote that P(M &gt;k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is ≤x. Let’s denote this probability as P_k(x). Then, for k=0, we have P_0(x)=1, since the sum of zero variables is 0, which is ≤x for x&gt;0. For k=1, P_1(x)=P(X1 ≤x)=x. For k=2, P_2(x)=P(X1 +X2 ≤x). As we saw, this is x^2 /2. Then, in general, P_k(x) = integral from 0 to x of P_{k-1}(x -t) dt, where t is the value of Xk. Since each Xi is uniform, the PDF of Xk is 1 on [0,1]. Therefore, P_k(x) = ∫_{0}^{x} P_{k-1}(x -t) dt.

Starting with P_0(x)=1, then:

P_1(x) = ∫_{0}^x P_0(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x 1 dt =x.

P_2(x)=∫_{0}^x P_1(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t) dt = [x t - t^2 /2 ] from 0 tox =x^2 -x^2 /2 =x^2 /2.

Similarly, P_3(x)=∫_{0}^x P_2(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 /2 dt = (1/2) ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 dt = (1/2)[ -(x -t)^3 /3 ] from 0 tox = (1/2)(x^3 /3 )=x^3 /6.

Continuing this way, we can see that P_k(x)=x^k /k!.

Therefore, by induction, if P_{k-1}(x)=x^{k-1}/(k-1)!, then P_k(x)=∫0^x t^{k-1}/(k-1)! dt =x^k /k!.

Hence, the formula holds. Therefore, the probability that M&gt;k is x^k /k!.

Yes, that seems to check out through induction as well.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

**Final Answer**
The probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is \boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \), we need to determine the probability that the sum of the first \( k \) uniform random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k \) on \([0, 1]\) is less than or equal to \( x \). This is equivalent to finding the probability that the minimum number \( M \) of variables needed to exceed \( x \) is greater than \( k \).

The sum \( S_k = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_k \) of \( k \) independent uniform random variables on \([0, 1]\) follows the Irwin–Hall distribution. For \( 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \), the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution simplifies to the volume of the \( k \)-dimensional simplex where each coordinate is non-negative and their sum is less than or equal to \( x \). This volume is given by \( \frac{x^k}{k!} \).

We can verify this result through induction:
- For \( k = 0 \), \( P(M &gt; 0) = 1 \), which matches \( \frac{x^0}{0!} = 1 \).
- For \( k = 1 \), \( P(M &gt; 1) = P(X_1 \leq x) = x \), which matches \( \frac{x^1}{1!} = x \).
- For \( k = 2 \), the probability that \( X_1 + X_2 \leq x \) is the area of a triangle with vertices \((0, 0)\), \((x, 0)\), and \((0, x)\), which is \( \frac{x^2}{2} \), matching \( \frac{x^2}{2!} \).

By induction, assuming \( P_{k-1}(x) = \frac{x^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \), we have:
\[ P_k(x) = \int_0^x P_{k-1}(x - t) \, dt = \int_0^x \frac{(x - t)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \, dt = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

Thus, the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is given by:
\[ P(M &gt; k) = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}\).          </p>

That makes sense because M is the first time the sum exceeds x, so if even after k variables the sum hasn&#x27;t exceeded x, then M must be greater than k.

Since each Xi is uniformly distributed on [0,1], their sum would follow some distribution. For independent uniform variables, the sum of n such variables is known to have an Irwin–Hall distribution. The probability that the sum of n uniform variables is less than or equal to x is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution. 

Wait, but the problem states that the variables are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform on [0,1], so the sum S_k = X1 + X2 + ... + Xk has a Irwin–Hall distribution. The CDF of S_k is given by:

P(S_k ≤ x) = (1/k!) * Σ_{i=0}^floor(x) (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (x - i)^k

But since x is between 0 and 1, and we are summing k variables each between 0 and 1, if x is in [0,1], then the sum S_k can range from 0 to k. However, if x is between 0 and 1, then floor(x) is 0 when x &lt; 1. Wait, hold on. Wait, x is a constant between 0 and 1, given. So we need the probability that the sum of k uniform variables is ≤ x. But each variable is at least 0, so the sum S_k is at least 0. But x is less than 1. So if we have k variables each at most 1, their sum can be up to k, but we are interested in the case where their sum is ≤ x &lt; 1.

But wait, if x is less than 1, then the maximum possible sum for k variables is k, but x is less than 1. So the event S_k ≤ x is equivalent to all variables being ≤ x and their sum ≤ x. Wait, no, that&#x27;s not necessarily the case. For example, if one variable is close to x and the others are zero, the sum can still be ≤ x. So actually, the event S_k ≤ x is the same as the sum of k non-negative numbers each ≤1 adding up to ≤x. Since x &lt; 1, all the variables must add up to something less than 1. 

But the variables are independent, so how do we compute the probability that their sum is ≤x? For x in [0,1], the volume of the k-dimensional simplex where each xi ≥0 and x1 + x2 + ... + xk ≤x. The volume of that region is x^k /k! . Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the volume (which corresponds to the probability since the variables are uniform) of the set {(x1, x2, ..., xk) ∈ [0,1]^k : x1 + ... + xk ≤x} is equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with edge length x, but constrained by each variable being at most 1. However, since x &lt;1 and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, the constraints xi ≤1 are automatically satisfied because each xi is non-negative and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, so each xi must be ≤x &lt;1. Therefore, the volume is indeed equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with side length x, which is x^k /k!.

So then, P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k! ?

Wait, but I thought the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution for n variables at x is (1/n!) Σ_{k=0}^floor(x)} (-1)^k C(n, k) (x -k)^n. But if x is in [0,1), then floor(x) =0, so the sum reduces to (1/n!)(x^n). So yes, in that case, P(S_n ≤x) = x^n /n!.

Wait, that seems right. So for example, when n=1, P(S_1 ≤x) = x, which is correct because X1 is uniform on [0,1]. For n=2, P(S_2 ≤x) = x^2 /2, which makes sense because the area under the line x1 + x2 =x in the unit square is a triangle with area x^2 /2. Similarly, for n=3, it&#x27;s a tetrahedron with volume x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!.

Therefore, in general, for x in [0,1), P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Therefore, since P(M &gt;k) = P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify with k=1. For k=1, P(M &gt;1) = P(X1 ≤x) = x, which matches x^1 /1! =x. For k=2, P(M&gt;2)=P(X1 + X2 ≤x). Since X1 and X2 are both uniform on [0,1], the probability that their sum is ≤x is the area of the triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,x), and (x,0). The area is (x^2)/2, which is x^2 /2! as per the formula. Similarly for k=3, it&#x27;s x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!. So yes, that seems to hold.

Therefore, the general formula for P(M&gt;k) when 0 &lt;x &lt;1 is x^k /k!.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose x is very close to 1, say x=0.99. Then for k=1, the probability is 0.99. For k=2, the probability that X1 + X2 ≤0.99 is 0.99^2 /2 ≈0.490, which is correct because the area under the line X1 + X2 =0.99 in the unit square is a triangle with area (0.99)^2 /2. But wait, 0.99^2 is approximately 0.98, so divided by 2 is 0.49, which is correct. If we compute the integral of the joint PDF over X1 + X2 ≤0.99, since X1 and X2 are independent uniform variables, the joint PDF is 1 over [0,1]^2. So integrating over X1 from 0 to 0.99, X2 from 0 to 0.99 - X1, which gives the area 0.99^2 /2. So that works.

Therefore, the formula holds for x in [0,1]. But wait, actually, the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution when x is in [0,1] is indeed x^k /k!.

So, given that, then P(M&gt;k) = x^k /k!.

But wait, let me check a different case. Suppose x=0.5 and k=3. Then P(M&gt;3) would be the probability that the sum of three uniforms is ≤0.5. The volume of the set {(x1, x2, x3) ∈ [0,1]^3 : x1 +x2 +x3 ≤0.5} is a tetrahedron with edge length 0.5, so its volume is (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208. Which is correct because integrating over x1 from 0 to 0.5, then x2 from 0 to 0.5 -x1, then x3 from 0 to 0.5 -x1 -x2. The triple integral would be:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1 -x2} dx3 dx2 dx1.

Which is equal to ∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2 dx1.

Let’s compute the inner integral:

∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2.

Let’s substitute u =0.5 -x1 -x2, then when x2=0, u=0.5 -x1, and when x2=0.5 -x1, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫_{u=0.5 -x1}^{0} u (-du) = ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} u du = [ (u^2)/2 ] from 0 to 0.5 -x1 = ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2.

Then the next integral is:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2 dx1.

Let’s substitute v=0.5 -x1, so when x1=0, v=0.5, and when x1=0.5, v=0. The integral becomes:

∫_{v=0.5}^{0} (v^2)/2 (-dv) = ∫_{0}^{0.5} (v^2)/2 dv = [ (v^3)/6 ] from 0 to 0.5 = (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208.

Which matches (0.5)^3 /3! =1/48. So that works. Therefore, the formula holds.

Therefore, the answer is P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. The question says &quot;non-negative integer k&quot;. So k can be zero? Let&#x27;s check.

If k=0, then P(M&gt;0) is the probability that M&gt;0. But M is defined as the minimum n≥1 such that the sum exceeds x. So M is always at least 1, because n starts at 1. Therefore, P(M&gt;0) should be 1, since M&gt;0 is always true. Let&#x27;s check the formula: x^0 /0! =1 /1=1. Correct.

For k=1, P(M&gt;1)=x /1 =x, which is correct as we saw earlier. So the formula works for k=0 as well.

Therefore, the general formula is P(M&gt;k) =x^k /k! for non-negative integers k, where 0 &lt;x &lt;1.

But wait, hold on. Let me check for k=2 and x=1. But x is strictly less than 1. The problem states 0 &lt;x &lt;1, so x=1 is excluded. But if x approaches 1, then P(M&gt;k) approaches 1^k /k! =1/k!.

But if x approaches 1, the probability that the sum of k uniforms is less than 1. However, for x=1 and k=2, the probability that the sum of two uniforms is less than 1 is 1/2, which is 1^2 /2!=1/2. Which is correct. Similarly, for k=3, x approaching 1, the probability approaches 1/6, which is correct.

Therefore, the formula holds even when x approaches 1, but since x is strictly less than 1, we don&#x27;t have to worry about the cases where x ≥1.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k) = \dfrac{x^k}{k!} for each non-negative integer k.

Wait, but I want to confirm once more.

Alternative approach: Let&#x27;s use recursion or generating functions. Let’s denote that P(M &gt;k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is ≤x. Let’s denote this probability as P_k(x). Then, for k=0, we have P_0(x)=1, since the sum of zero variables is 0, which is ≤x for x&gt;0. For k=1, P_1(x)=P(X1 ≤x)=x. For k=2, P_2(x)=P(X1 +X2 ≤x). As we saw, this is x^2 /2. Then, in general, P_k(x) = integral from 0 to x of P_{k-1}(x -t) dt, where t is the value of Xk. Since each Xi is uniform, the PDF of Xk is 1 on [0,1]. Therefore, P_k(x) = ∫_{0}^{x} P_{k-1}(x -t) dt.

Starting with P_0(x)=1, then:

P_1(x) = ∫_{0}^x P_0(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x 1 dt =x.

P_2(x)=∫_{0}^x P_1(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t) dt = [x t - t^2 /2 ] from 0 tox =x^2 -x^2 /2 =x^2 /2.

Similarly, P_3(x)=∫_{0}^x P_2(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 /2 dt = (1/2) ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 dt = (1/2)[ -(x -t)^3 /3 ] from 0 tox = (1/2)(x^3 /3 )=x^3 /6.

Continuing this way, we can see that P_k(x)=x^k /k!.

Therefore, by induction, if P_{k-1}(x)=x^{k-1}/(k-1)!, then P_k(x)=∫0^x t^{k-1}/(k-1)! dt =x^k /k!.

Hence, the formula holds. Therefore, the probability that M&gt;k is x^k /k!.

Yes, that seems to check out through induction as well.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

**Final Answer**
The probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is \boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \), we need to determine the probability that the sum of the first \( k \) uniform random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k \) on \([0, 1]\) is less than or equal to \( x \). This is equivalent to finding the probability that the minimum number \( M \) of variables needed to exceed \( x \) is greater than \( k \).

The sum \( S_k = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_k \) of \( k \) independent uniform random variables on \([0, 1]\) follows the Irwin–Hall distribution. For \( 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \), the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution simplifies to the volume of the \( k \)-dimensional simplex where each coordinate is non-negative and their sum is less than or equal to \( x \). This volume is given by \( \frac{x^k}{k!} \).

We can verify this result through induction:
- For \( k = 0 \), \( P(M &gt; 0) = 1 \), which matches \( \frac{x^0}{0!} = 1 \).
- For \( k = 1 \), \( P(M &gt; 1) = P(X_1 \leq x) = x \), which matches \( \frac{x^1}{1!} = x \).
- For \( k = 2 \), the probability that \( X_1 + X_2 \leq x \) is the area of a triangle with vertices \((0, 0)\), \((x, 0)\), and \((0, x)\), which is \( \frac{x^2}{2} \), matching \( \frac{x^2}{2!} \).

By induction, assuming \( P_{k-1}(x) = \frac{x^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \), we have:
\[ P_k(x) = \int_0^x P_{k-1}(x - t) \, dt = \int_0^x \frac{(x - t)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \, dt = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

Thus, the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is given by:
\[ P(M &gt; k) = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the probability that the minimum number of uniform random variables needed to exceed a certain threshold x is greater than k. In other words, P(M &gt; k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is still less than or equal to x. That makes sense because M is the first time the sum exceeds x, so if even after k variables the sum hasn&#x27;t exceeded x, then M must be greater than k.

Since each Xi is uniformly distributed on [0,1], their sum would follow some distribution. For independent uniform variables, the sum of n such variables is known to have an Irwin–Hall distribution. The probability that the sum of n uniform variables is less than or equal to x is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution. 

Wait, but the problem states that the variables are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform on [0,1], so the sum S_k = X1 + X2 + ... + Xk has a Irwin–Hall distribution. The CDF of S_k is given by:

P(S_k ≤ x) = (1/k!) * Σ_{i=0}^floor(x) (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (x - i)^k

But since x is between 0 and 1, and we are summing k variables each between 0 and 1, if x is in [0,1], then the sum S_k can range from 0 to k. However, if x is between 0 and 1, then floor(x) is 0 when x &lt; 1. Wait, hold on. Wait, x is a constant between 0 and 1, given. So we need the probability that the sum of k uniform variables is ≤ x. But each variable is at least 0, so the sum S_k is at least 0. But x is less than 1. So if we have k variables each at most 1, their sum can be up to k, but we are interested in the case where their sum is ≤ x &lt; 1.

But wait, if x is less than 1, then the maximum possible sum for k variables is k, but x is less than 1. So the event S_k ≤ x is equivalent to all variables being ≤ x and their sum ≤ x. Wait, no, that&#x27;s not necessarily the case. For example, if one variable is close to x and the others are zero, the sum can still be ≤ x. So actually, the event S_k ≤ x is the same as the sum of k non-negative numbers each ≤1 adding up to ≤x. Since x &lt; 1, all the variables must add up to something less than 1. 

But the variables are independent, so how do we compute the probability that their sum is ≤x? For x in [0,1], the volume of the k-dimensional simplex where each xi ≥0 and x1 + x2 + ... + xk ≤x. The volume of that region is x^k /k! . Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the volume (which corresponds to the probability since the variables are uniform) of the set {(x1, x2, ..., xk) ∈ [0,1]^k : x1 + ... + xk ≤x} is equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with edge length x, but constrained by each variable being at most 1. However, since x &lt;1 and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, the constraints xi ≤1 are automatically satisfied because each xi is non-negative and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, so each xi must be ≤x &lt;1. Therefore, the volume is indeed equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with side length x, which is x^k /k!.

So then, P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k! ?

Wait, but I thought the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution for n variables at x is (1/n!) Σ_{k=0}^floor(x)} (-1)^k C(n, k) (x -k)^n. But if x is in [0,1), then floor(x) =0, so the sum reduces to (1/n!)(x^n). So yes, in that case, P(S_n ≤x) = x^n /n!.

Wait, that seems right. So for example, when n=1, P(S_1 ≤x) = x, which is correct because X1 is uniform on [0,1]. For n=2, P(S_2 ≤x) = x^2 /2, which makes sense because the area under the line x1 + x2 =x in the unit square is a triangle with area x^2 /2. Similarly, for n=3, it&#x27;s a tetrahedron with volume x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!.

Therefore, in general, for x in [0,1), P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Therefore, since P(M &gt;k) = P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify with k=1. For k=1, P(M &gt;1) = P(X1 ≤x) = x, which matches x^1 /1! =x. For k=2, P(M&gt;2)=P(X1 + X2 ≤x). Since X1 and X2 are both uniform on [0,1], the probability that their sum is ≤x is the area of the triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,x), and (x,0). The area is (x^2)/2, which is x^2 /2! as per the formula. Similarly for k=3, it&#x27;s x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!. So yes, that seems to hold.

Therefore, the general formula for P(M&gt;k) when 0 &lt;x &lt;1 is x^k /k!.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose x is very close to 1, say x=0.99. Then for k=1, the probability is 0.99. For k=2, the probability that X1 + X2 ≤0.99 is 0.99^2 /2 ≈0.490, which is correct because the area under the line X1 + X2 =0.99 in the unit square is a triangle with area (0.99)^2 /2. But wait, 0.99^2 is approximately 0.98, so divided by 2 is 0.49, which is correct. If we compute the integral of the joint PDF over X1 + X2 ≤0.99, since X1 and X2 are independent uniform variables, the joint PDF is 1 over [0,1]^2. So integrating over X1 from 0 to 0.99, X2 from 0 to 0.99 - X1, which gives the area 0.99^2 /2. So that works.

Therefore, the formula holds for x in [0,1]. But wait, actually, the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution when x is in [0,1] is indeed x^k /k!.

So, given that, then P(M&gt;k) = x^k /k!.

But wait, let me check a different case. Suppose x=0.5 and k=3. Then P(M&gt;3) would be the probability that the sum of three uniforms is ≤0.5. The volume of the set {(x1, x2, x3) ∈ [0,1]^3 : x1 +x2 +x3 ≤0.5} is a tetrahedron with edge length 0.5, so its volume is (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208. Which is correct because integrating over x1 from 0 to 0.5, then x2 from 0 to 0.5 -x1, then x3 from 0 to 0.5 -x1 -x2. The triple integral would be:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1 -x2} dx3 dx2 dx1.

Which is equal to ∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2 dx1.

Let’s compute the inner integral:

∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2.

Let’s substitute u =0.5 -x1 -x2, then when x2=0, u=0.5 -x1, and when x2=0.5 -x1, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫_{u=0.5 -x1}^{0} u (-du) = ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} u du = [ (u^2)/2 ] from 0 to 0.5 -x1 = ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2.

Then the next integral is:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2 dx1.

Let’s substitute v=0.5 -x1, so when x1=0, v=0.5, and when x1=0.5, v=0. The integral becomes:

∫_{v=0.5}^{0} (v^2)/2 (-dv) = ∫_{0}^{0.5} (v^2)/2 dv = [ (v^3)/6 ] from 0 to 0.5 = (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208.

Which matches (0.5)^3 /3! =1/48. So that works. Therefore, the formula holds.

Therefore, the answer is P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. The question says &quot;non-negative integer k&quot;. So k can be zero? Let&#x27;s check.

If k=0, then P(M&gt;0) is the probability that M&gt;0. But M is defined as the minimum n≥1 such that the sum exceeds x. So M is always at least 1, because n starts at 1. Therefore, P(M&gt;0) should be 1, since M&gt;0 is always true. Let&#x27;s check the formula: x^0 /0! =1 /1=1. Correct.

For k=1, P(M&gt;1)=x /1 =x, which is correct as we saw earlier. So the formula works for k=0 as well.

Therefore, the general formula is P(M&gt;k) =x^k /k! for non-negative integers k, where 0 &lt;x &lt;1.

But wait, hold on. Let me check for k=2 and x=1. But x is strictly less than 1. The problem states 0 &lt;x &lt;1, so x=1 is excluded. But if x approaches 1, then P(M&gt;k) approaches 1^k /k! =1/k!.

But if x approaches 1, the probability that the sum of k uniforms is less than 1. However, for x=1 and k=2, the probability that the sum of two uniforms is less than 1 is 1/2, which is 1^2 /2!=1/2. Which is correct. Similarly, for k=3, x approaching 1, the probability approaches 1/6, which is correct.

Therefore, the formula holds even when x approaches 1, but since x is strictly less than 1, we don&#x27;t have to worry about the cases where x ≥1.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k) = \dfrac{x^k}{k!} for each non-negative integer k.

Wait, but I want to confirm once more.

Alternative approach: Let&#x27;s use recursion or generating functions. Let’s denote that P(M &gt;k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is ≤x. Let’s denote this probability as P_k(x). Then, for k=0, we have P_0(x)=1, since the sum of zero variables is 0, which is ≤x for x&gt;0. For k=1, P_1(x)=P(X1 ≤x)=x. For k=2, P_2(x)=P(X1 +X2 ≤x). As we saw, this is x^2 /2. Then, in general, P_k(x) = integral from 0 to x of P_{k-1}(x -t) dt, where t is the value of Xk. Since each Xi is uniform, the PDF of Xk is 1 on [0,1]. Therefore, P_k(x) = ∫_{0}^{x} P_{k-1}(x -t) dt.

Starting with P_0(x)=1, then:

P_1(x) = ∫_{0}^x P_0(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x 1 dt =x.

P_2(x)=∫_{0}^x P_1(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t) dt = [x t - t^2 /2 ] from 0 tox =x^2 -x^2 /2 =x^2 /2.

Similarly, P_3(x)=∫_{0}^x P_2(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 /2 dt = (1/2) ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 dt = (1/2)[ -(x -t)^3 /3 ] from 0 tox = (1/2)(x^3 /3 )=x^3 /6.

Continuing this way, we can see that P_k(x)=x^k /k!.

Therefore, by induction, if P_{k-1}(x)=x^{k-1}/(k-1)!, then P_k(x)=∫0^x t^{k-1}/(k-1)! dt =x^k /k!.

Hence, the formula holds. Therefore, the probability that M&gt;k is x^k /k!.

Yes, that seems to check out through induction as well.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

**Final Answer**
The probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is \boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \), we need to determine the probability that the sum of the first \( k \) uniform random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k \) on \([0, 1]\) is less than or equal to \( x \). This is equivalent to finding the probability that the minimum number \( M \) of variables needed to exceed \( x \) is greater than \( k \).

The sum \( S_k = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_k \) of \( k \) independent uniform random variables on \([0, 1]\) follows the Irwin–Hall distribution. For \( 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \), the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution simplifies to the volume of the \( k \)-dimensional simplex where each coordinate is non-negative and their sum is less than or equal to \( x \). This volume is given by \( \frac{x^k}{k!} \).

We can verify this result through induction:
- For \( k = 0 \), \( P(M &gt; 0) = 1 \), which matches \( \frac{x^0}{0!} = 1 \).
- For \( k = 1 \), \( P(M &gt; 1) = P(X_1 \leq x) = x \), which matches \( \frac{x^1}{1!} = x \).
- For \( k = 2 \), the probability that \( X_1 + X_2 \leq x \) is the area of a triangle with vertices \((0, 0)\), \((x, 0)\), and \((0, x)\), which is \( \frac{x^2}{2} \), matching \( \frac{x^2}{2!} \).

By induction, assuming \( P_{k-1}(x) = \frac{x^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \), we have:
\[ P_k(x) = \int_0^x P_{k-1}(x - t) \, dt = \int_0^x \frac{(x - t)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \, dt = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

Thus, the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is given by:
\[ P(M &gt; k) = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}\).          </p>

That makes sense because M is the first time the sum exceeds x, so if even after k variables the sum hasn&#x27;t exceeded x, then M must be greater than k.

Since each Xi is uniformly distributed on [0,1], their sum would follow some distribution. For independent uniform variables, the sum of n such variables is known to have an Irwin–Hall distribution. The probability that the sum of n uniform variables is less than or equal to x is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution. 

Wait, but the problem states that the variables are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform on [0,1], so the sum S_k = X1 + X2 + ... + Xk has a Irwin–Hall distribution. The CDF of S_k is given by:

P(S_k ≤ x) = (1/k!) * Σ_{i=0}^floor(x) (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (x - i)^k

But since x is between 0 and 1, and we are summing k variables each between 0 and 1, if x is in [0,1], then the sum S_k can range from 0 to k. However, if x is between 0 and 1, then floor(x) is 0 when x &lt; 1. Wait, hold on. Wait, x is a constant between 0 and 1, given. So we need the probability that the sum of k uniform variables is ≤ x. But each variable is at least 0, so the sum S_k is at least 0. But x is less than 1. So if we have k variables each at most 1, their sum can be up to k, but we are interested in the case where their sum is ≤ x &lt; 1.

But wait, if x is less than 1, then the maximum possible sum for k variables is k, but x is less than 1. So the event S_k ≤ x is equivalent to all variables being ≤ x and their sum ≤ x. Wait, no, that&#x27;s not necessarily the case. For example, if one variable is close to x and the others are zero, the sum can still be ≤ x. So actually, the event S_k ≤ x is the same as the sum of k non-negative numbers each ≤1 adding up to ≤x. Since x &lt; 1, all the variables must add up to something less than 1. 

But the variables are independent, so how do we compute the probability that their sum is ≤x? For x in [0,1], the volume of the k-dimensional simplex where each xi ≥0 and x1 + x2 + ... + xk ≤x. The volume of that region is x^k /k! . Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the volume (which corresponds to the probability since the variables are uniform) of the set {(x1, x2, ..., xk) ∈ [0,1]^k : x1 + ... + xk ≤x} is equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with edge length x, but constrained by each variable being at most 1. However, since x &lt;1 and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, the constraints xi ≤1 are automatically satisfied because each xi is non-negative and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, so each xi must be ≤x &lt;1. Therefore, the volume is indeed equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with side length x, which is x^k /k!.

So then, P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k! ?

Wait, but I thought the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution for n variables at x is (1/n!) Σ_{k=0}^floor(x)} (-1)^k C(n, k) (x -k)^n. But if x is in [0,1), then floor(x) =0, so the sum reduces to (1/n!)(x^n). So yes, in that case, P(S_n ≤x) = x^n /n!.

Wait, that seems right. So for example, when n=1, P(S_1 ≤x) = x, which is correct because X1 is uniform on [0,1]. For n=2, P(S_2 ≤x) = x^2 /2, which makes sense because the area under the line x1 + x2 =x in the unit square is a triangle with area x^2 /2. Similarly, for n=3, it&#x27;s a tetrahedron with volume x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!.

Therefore, in general, for x in [0,1), P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Therefore, since P(M &gt;k) = P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify with k=1. For k=1, P(M &gt;1) = P(X1 ≤x) = x, which matches x^1 /1! =x. For k=2, P(M&gt;2)=P(X1 + X2 ≤x). Since X1 and X2 are both uniform on [0,1], the probability that their sum is ≤x is the area of the triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,x), and (x,0). The area is (x^2)/2, which is x^2 /2! as per the formula. Similarly for k=3, it&#x27;s x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!. So yes, that seems to hold.

Therefore, the general formula for P(M&gt;k) when 0 &lt;x &lt;1 is x^k /k!.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose x is very close to 1, say x=0.99. Then for k=1, the probability is 0.99. For k=2, the probability that X1 + X2 ≤0.99 is 0.99^2 /2 ≈0.490, which is correct because the area under the line X1 + X2 =0.99 in the unit square is a triangle with area (0.99)^2 /2. But wait, 0.99^2 is approximately 0.98, so divided by 2 is 0.49, which is correct. If we compute the integral of the joint PDF over X1 + X2 ≤0.99, since X1 and X2 are independent uniform variables, the joint PDF is 1 over [0,1]^2. So integrating over X1 from 0 to 0.99, X2 from 0 to 0.99 - X1, which gives the area 0.99^2 /2. So that works.

Therefore, the formula holds for x in [0,1]. But wait, actually, the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution when x is in [0,1] is indeed x^k /k!.

So, given that, then P(M&gt;k) = x^k /k!.

But wait, let me check a different case. Suppose x=0.5 and k=3. Then P(M&gt;3) would be the probability that the sum of three uniforms is ≤0.5. The volume of the set {(x1, x2, x3) ∈ [0,1]^3 : x1 +x2 +x3 ≤0.5} is a tetrahedron with edge length 0.5, so its volume is (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208. Which is correct because integrating over x1 from 0 to 0.5, then x2 from 0 to 0.5 -x1, then x3 from 0 to 0.5 -x1 -x2. The triple integral would be:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1 -x2} dx3 dx2 dx1.

Which is equal to ∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2 dx1.

Let’s compute the inner integral:

∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2.

Let’s substitute u =0.5 -x1 -x2, then when x2=0, u=0.5 -x1, and when x2=0.5 -x1, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫_{u=0.5 -x1}^{0} u (-du) = ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} u du = [ (u^2)/2 ] from 0 to 0.5 -x1 = ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2.

Then the next integral is:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2 dx1.

Let’s substitute v=0.5 -x1, so when x1=0, v=0.5, and when x1=0.5, v=0. The integral becomes:

∫_{v=0.5}^{0} (v^2)/2 (-dv) = ∫_{0}^{0.5} (v^2)/2 dv = [ (v^3)/6 ] from 0 to 0.5 = (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208.

Which matches (0.5)^3 /3! =1/48. So that works. Therefore, the formula holds.

Therefore, the answer is P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. The question says &quot;non-negative integer k&quot;. So k can be zero? Let&#x27;s check.

If k=0, then P(M&gt;0) is the probability that M&gt;0. But M is defined as the minimum n≥1 such that the sum exceeds x. So M is always at least 1, because n starts at 1. Therefore, P(M&gt;0) should be 1, since M&gt;0 is always true. Let&#x27;s check the formula: x^0 /0! =1 /1=1. Correct.

For k=1, P(M&gt;1)=x /1 =x, which is correct as we saw earlier. So the formula works for k=0 as well.

Therefore, the general formula is P(M&gt;k) =x^k /k! for non-negative integers k, where 0 &lt;x &lt;1.

But wait, hold on. Let me check for k=2 and x=1. But x is strictly less than 1. The problem states 0 &lt;x &lt;1, so x=1 is excluded. But if x approaches 1, then P(M&gt;k) approaches 1^k /k! =1/k!.

But if x approaches 1, the probability that the sum of k uniforms is less than 1. However, for x=1 and k=2, the probability that the sum of two uniforms is less than 1 is 1/2, which is 1^2 /2!=1/2. Which is correct. Similarly, for k=3, x approaching 1, the probability approaches 1/6, which is correct.

Therefore, the formula holds even when x approaches 1, but since x is strictly less than 1, we don&#x27;t have to worry about the cases where x ≥1.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k) = \dfrac{x^k}{k!} for each non-negative integer k.

Wait, but I want to confirm once more.

Alternative approach: Let&#x27;s use recursion or generating functions. Let’s denote that P(M &gt;k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is ≤x. Let’s denote this probability as P_k(x). Then, for k=0, we have P_0(x)=1, since the sum of zero variables is 0, which is ≤x for x&gt;0. For k=1, P_1(x)=P(X1 ≤x)=x. For k=2, P_2(x)=P(X1 +X2 ≤x). As we saw, this is x^2 /2. Then, in general, P_k(x) = integral from 0 to x of P_{k-1}(x -t) dt, where t is the value of Xk. Since each Xi is uniform, the PDF of Xk is 1 on [0,1]. Therefore, P_k(x) = ∫_{0}^{x} P_{k-1}(x -t) dt.

Starting with P_0(x)=1, then:

P_1(x) = ∫_{0}^x P_0(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x 1 dt =x.

P_2(x)=∫_{0}^x P_1(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t) dt = [x t - t^2 /2 ] from 0 tox =x^2 -x^2 /2 =x^2 /2.

Similarly, P_3(x)=∫_{0}^x P_2(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 /2 dt = (1/2) ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 dt = (1/2)[ -(x -t)^3 /3 ] from 0 tox = (1/2)(x^3 /3 )=x^3 /6.

Continuing this way, we can see that P_k(x)=x^k /k!.

Therefore, by induction, if P_{k-1}(x)=x^{k-1}/(k-1)!, then P_k(x)=∫0^x t^{k-1}/(k-1)! dt =x^k /k!.

Hence, the formula holds. Therefore, the probability that M&gt;k is x^k /k!.

Yes, that seems to check out through induction as well.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

**Final Answer**
The probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is \boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \), we need to determine the probability that the sum of the first \( k \) uniform random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k \) on \([0, 1]\) is less than or equal to \( x \). This is equivalent to finding the probability that the minimum number \( M \) of variables needed to exceed \( x \) is greater than \( k \).

The sum \( S_k = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_k \) of \( k \) independent uniform random variables on \([0, 1]\) follows the Irwin–Hall distribution. For \( 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \), the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution simplifies to the volume of the \( k \)-dimensional simplex where each coordinate is non-negative and their sum is less than or equal to \( x \). This volume is given by \( \frac{x^k}{k!} \).

We can verify this result through induction:
- For \( k = 0 \), \( P(M &gt; 0) = 1 \), which matches \( \frac{x^0}{0!} = 1 \).
- For \( k = 1 \), \( P(M &gt; 1) = P(X_1 \leq x) = x \), which matches \( \frac{x^1}{1!} = x \).
- For \( k = 2 \), the probability that \( X_1 + X_2 \leq x \) is the area of a triangle with vertices \((0, 0)\), \((x, 0)\), and \((0, x)\), which is \( \frac{x^2}{2} \), matching \( \frac{x^2}{2!} \).

By induction, assuming \( P_{k-1}(x) = \frac{x^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \), we have:
\[ P_k(x) = \int_0^x P_{k-1}(x - t) \, dt = \int_0^x \frac{(x - t)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \, dt = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

Thus, the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is given by:
\[ P(M &gt; k) = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the probability that the minimum number of uniform random variables needed to exceed a certain threshold x is greater than k. In other words, P(M &gt; k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is still less than or equal to x. That makes sense because M is the first time the sum exceeds x, so if even after k variables the sum hasn&#x27;t exceeded x, then M must be greater than k.

Since each Xi is uniformly distributed on [0,1], their sum would follow some distribution. For independent uniform variables, the sum of n such variables is known to have an Irwin–Hall distribution. The probability that the sum of n uniform variables is less than or equal to x is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution. 

Wait, but the problem states that the variables are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform on [0,1], so the sum S_k = X1 + X2 + ... + Xk has a Irwin–Hall distribution. The CDF of S_k is given by:

P(S_k ≤ x) = (1/k!) * Σ_{i=0}^floor(x) (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (x - i)^k

But since x is between 0 and 1, and we are summing k variables each between 0 and 1, if x is in [0,1], then the sum S_k can range from 0 to k. However, if x is between 0 and 1, then floor(x) is 0 when x &lt; 1. Wait, hold on. Wait, x is a constant between 0 and 1, given. So we need the probability that the sum of k uniform variables is ≤ x. But each variable is at least 0, so the sum S_k is at least 0. But x is less than 1. So if we have k variables each at most 1, their sum can be up to k, but we are interested in the case where their sum is ≤ x &lt; 1.

But wait, if x is less than 1, then the maximum possible sum for k variables is k, but x is less than 1. So the event S_k ≤ x is equivalent to all variables being ≤ x and their sum ≤ x. Wait, no, that&#x27;s not necessarily the case. For example, if one variable is close to x and the others are zero, the sum can still be ≤ x. So actually, the event S_k ≤ x is the same as the sum of k non-negative numbers each ≤1 adding up to ≤x. Since x &lt; 1, all the variables must add up to something less than 1. 

But the variables are independent, so how do we compute the probability that their sum is ≤x? For x in [0,1], the volume of the k-dimensional simplex where each xi ≥0 and x1 + x2 + ... + xk ≤x. The volume of that region is x^k /k! . Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the volume (which corresponds to the probability since the variables are uniform) of the set {(x1, x2, ..., xk) ∈ [0,1]^k : x1 + ... + xk ≤x} is equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with edge length x, but constrained by each variable being at most 1. However, since x &lt;1 and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, the constraints xi ≤1 are automatically satisfied because each xi is non-negative and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, so each xi must be ≤x &lt;1. Therefore, the volume is indeed equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with side length x, which is x^k /k!.

So then, P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k! ?

Wait, but I thought the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution for n variables at x is (1/n!) Σ_{k=0}^floor(x)} (-1)^k C(n, k) (x -k)^n. But if x is in [0,1), then floor(x) =0, so the sum reduces to (1/n!)(x^n). So yes, in that case, P(S_n ≤x) = x^n /n!.

Wait, that seems right. So for example, when n=1, P(S_1 ≤x) = x, which is correct because X1 is uniform on [0,1]. For n=2, P(S_2 ≤x) = x^2 /2, which makes sense because the area under the line x1 + x2 =x in the unit square is a triangle with area x^2 /2. Similarly, for n=3, it&#x27;s a tetrahedron with volume x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!.

Therefore, in general, for x in [0,1), P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Therefore, since P(M &gt;k) = P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify with k=1. For k=1, P(M &gt;1) = P(X1 ≤x) = x, which matches x^1 /1! =x. For k=2, P(M&gt;2)=P(X1 + X2 ≤x). Since X1 and X2 are both uniform on [0,1], the probability that their sum is ≤x is the area of the triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,x), and (x,0). The area is (x^2)/2, which is x^2 /2! as per the formula. Similarly for k=3, it&#x27;s x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!. So yes, that seems to hold.

Therefore, the general formula for P(M&gt;k) when 0 &lt;x &lt;1 is x^k /k!.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose x is very close to 1, say x=0.99. Then for k=1, the probability is 0.99. For k=2, the probability that X1 + X2 ≤0.99 is 0.99^2 /2 ≈0.490, which is correct because the area under the line X1 + X2 =0.99 in the unit square is a triangle with area (0.99)^2 /2. But wait, 0.99^2 is approximately 0.98, so divided by 2 is 0.49, which is correct. If we compute the integral of the joint PDF over X1 + X2 ≤0.99, since X1 and X2 are independent uniform variables, the joint PDF is 1 over [0,1]^2. So integrating over X1 from 0 to 0.99, X2 from 0 to 0.99 - X1, which gives the area 0.99^2 /2. So that works.

Therefore, the formula holds for x in [0,1]. But wait, actually, the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution when x is in [0,1] is indeed x^k /k!.

So, given that, then P(M&gt;k) = x^k /k!.

But wait, let me check a different case. Suppose x=0.5 and k=3. Then P(M&gt;3) would be the probability that the sum of three uniforms is ≤0.5. The volume of the set {(x1, x2, x3) ∈ [0,1]^3 : x1 +x2 +x3 ≤0.5} is a tetrahedron with edge length 0.5, so its volume is (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208. Which is correct because integrating over x1 from 0 to 0.5, then x2 from 0 to 0.5 -x1, then x3 from 0 to 0.5 -x1 -x2. The triple integral would be:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1 -x2} dx3 dx2 dx1.

Which is equal to ∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2 dx1.

Let’s compute the inner integral:

∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2.

Let’s substitute u =0.5 -x1 -x2, then when x2=0, u=0.5 -x1, and when x2=0.5 -x1, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫_{u=0.5 -x1}^{0} u (-du) = ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} u du = [ (u^2)/2 ] from 0 to 0.5 -x1 = ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2.

Then the next integral is:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2 dx1.

Let’s substitute v=0.5 -x1, so when x1=0, v=0.5, and when x1=0.5, v=0. The integral becomes:

∫_{v=0.5}^{0} (v^2)/2 (-dv) = ∫_{0}^{0.5} (v^2)/2 dv = [ (v^3)/6 ] from 0 to 0.5 = (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208.

Which matches (0.5)^3 /3! =1/48. So that works. Therefore, the formula holds.

Therefore, the answer is P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. The question says &quot;non-negative integer k&quot;. So k can be zero? Let&#x27;s check.

If k=0, then P(M&gt;0) is the probability that M&gt;0. But M is defined as the minimum n≥1 such that the sum exceeds x. So M is always at least 1, because n starts at 1. Therefore, P(M&gt;0) should be 1, since M&gt;0 is always true. Let&#x27;s check the formula: x^0 /0! =1 /1=1. Correct.

For k=1, P(M&gt;1)=x /1 =x, which is correct as we saw earlier. So the formula works for k=0 as well.

Therefore, the general formula is P(M&gt;k) =x^k /k! for non-negative integers k, where 0 &lt;x &lt;1.

But wait, hold on. Let me check for k=2 and x=1. But x is strictly less than 1. The problem states 0 &lt;x &lt;1, so x=1 is excluded. But if x approaches 1, then P(M&gt;k) approaches 1^k /k! =1/k!.

But if x approaches 1, the probability that the sum of k uniforms is less than 1. However, for x=1 and k=2, the probability that the sum of two uniforms is less than 1 is 1/2, which is 1^2 /2!=1/2. Which is correct. Similarly, for k=3, x approaching 1, the probability approaches 1/6, which is correct.

Therefore, the formula holds even when x approaches 1, but since x is strictly less than 1, we don&#x27;t have to worry about the cases where x ≥1.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k) = \dfrac{x^k}{k!} for each non-negative integer k.

Wait, but I want to confirm once more.

Alternative approach: Let&#x27;s use recursion or generating functions. Let’s denote that P(M &gt;k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is ≤x. Let’s denote this probability as P_k(x). Then, for k=0, we have P_0(x)=1, since the sum of zero variables is 0, which is ≤x for x&gt;0. For k=1, P_1(x)=P(X1 ≤x)=x. For k=2, P_2(x)=P(X1 +X2 ≤x). As we saw, this is x^2 /2. Then, in general, P_k(x) = integral from 0 to x of P_{k-1}(x -t) dt, where t is the value of Xk. Since each Xi is uniform, the PDF of Xk is 1 on [0,1]. Therefore, P_k(x) = ∫_{0}^{x} P_{k-1}(x -t) dt.

Starting with P_0(x)=1, then:

P_1(x) = ∫_{0}^x P_0(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x 1 dt =x.

P_2(x)=∫_{0}^x P_1(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t) dt = [x t - t^2 /2 ] from 0 tox =x^2 -x^2 /2 =x^2 /2.

Similarly, P_3(x)=∫_{0}^x P_2(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 /2 dt = (1/2) ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 dt = (1/2)[ -(x -t)^3 /3 ] from 0 tox = (1/2)(x^3 /3 )=x^3 /6.

Continuing this way, we can see that P_k(x)=x^k /k!.

Therefore, by induction, if P_{k-1}(x)=x^{k-1}/(k-1)!, then P_k(x)=∫0^x t^{k-1}/(k-1)! dt =x^k /k!.

Hence, the formula holds. Therefore, the probability that M&gt;k is x^k /k!.

Yes, that seems to check out through induction as well.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

**Final Answer**
The probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is \boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \), we need to determine the probability that the sum of the first \( k \) uniform random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k \) on \([0, 1]\) is less than or equal to \( x \). This is equivalent to finding the probability that the minimum number \( M \) of variables needed to exceed \( x \) is greater than \( k \).

The sum \( S_k = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_k \) of \( k \) independent uniform random variables on \([0, 1]\) follows the Irwin–Hall distribution. For \( 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \), the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution simplifies to the volume of the \( k \)-dimensional simplex where each coordinate is non-negative and their sum is less than or equal to \( x \). This volume is given by \( \frac{x^k}{k!} \).

We can verify this result through induction:
- For \( k = 0 \), \( P(M &gt; 0) = 1 \), which matches \( \frac{x^0}{0!} = 1 \).
- For \( k = 1 \), \( P(M &gt; 1) = P(X_1 \leq x) = x \), which matches \( \frac{x^1}{1!} = x \).
- For \( k = 2 \), the probability that \( X_1 + X_2 \leq x \) is the area of a triangle with vertices \((0, 0)\), \((x, 0)\), and \((0, x)\), which is \( \frac{x^2}{2} \), matching \( \frac{x^2}{2!} \).

By induction, assuming \( P_{k-1}(x) = \frac{x^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \), we have:
\[ P_k(x) = \int_0^x P_{k-1}(x - t) \, dt = \int_0^x \frac{(x - t)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \, dt = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

Thus, the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is given by:
\[ P(M &gt; k) = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

Wait, but the problem states that the variables are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform on [0,1], so the sum S_k = X1 + X2 + ... + Xk has a Irwin–Hall distribution. The CDF of S_k is given by:

P(S_k ≤ x) = (1/k!) * Σ_{i=0}^floor(x) (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (x - i)^k

But since x is between 0 and 1, and we are summing k variables each between 0 and 1, if x is in [0,1], then the sum S_k can range from 0 to k. However, if x is between 0 and 1, then floor(x) is 0 when x &lt; 1. Wait, hold on. Wait, x is a constant between 0 and 1, given. So we need the probability that the sum of k uniform variables is ≤ x. But each variable is at least 0, so the sum S_k is at least 0. But x is less than 1. So if we have k variables each at most 1, their sum can be up to k, but we are interested in the case where their sum is ≤ x &lt; 1.

But wait, if x is less than 1, then the maximum possible sum for k variables is k, but x is less than 1. So the event S_k ≤ x is equivalent to all variables being ≤ x and their sum ≤ x. Wait, no, that&#x27;s not necessarily the case. For example, if one variable is close to x and the others are zero, the sum can still be ≤ x. So actually, the event S_k ≤ x is the same as the sum of k non-negative numbers each ≤1 adding up to ≤x. Since x &lt; 1, all the variables must add up to something less than 1. 

But the variables are independent, so how do we compute the probability that their sum is ≤x? For x in [0,1], the volume of the k-dimensional simplex where each xi ≥0 and x1 + x2 + ... + xk ≤x. The volume of that region is x^k /k! . Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the volume (which corresponds to the probability since the variables are uniform) of the set {(x1, x2, ..., xk) ∈ [0,1]^k : x1 + ... + xk ≤x} is equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with edge length x, but constrained by each variable being at most 1. However, since x &lt;1 and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, the constraints xi ≤1 are automatically satisfied because each xi is non-negative and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, so each xi must be ≤x &lt;1. Therefore, the volume is indeed equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with side length x, which is x^k /k!.

So then, P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k! ?

Wait, but I thought the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution for n variables at x is (1/n!) Σ_{k=0}^floor(x)} (-1)^k C(n, k) (x -k)^n. But if x is in [0,1), then floor(x) =0, so the sum reduces to (1/n!)(x^n). So yes, in that case, P(S_n ≤x) = x^n /n!.

Wait, that seems right. So for example, when n=1, P(S_1 ≤x) = x, which is correct because X1 is uniform on [0,1]. For n=2, P(S_2 ≤x) = x^2 /2, which makes sense because the area under the line x1 + x2 =x in the unit square is a triangle with area x^2 /2. Similarly, for n=3, it&#x27;s a tetrahedron with volume x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!.

Therefore, in general, for x in [0,1), P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Therefore, since P(M &gt;k) = P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify with k=1. For k=1, P(M &gt;1) = P(X1 ≤x) = x, which matches x^1 /1! =x. For k=2, P(M&gt;2)=P(X1 + X2 ≤x). Since X1 and X2 are both uniform on [0,1], the probability that their sum is ≤x is the area of the triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,x), and (x,0). The area is (x^2)/2, which is x^2 /2! as per the formula. Similarly for k=3, it&#x27;s x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!. So yes, that seems to hold.

Therefore, the general formula for P(M&gt;k) when 0 &lt;x &lt;1 is x^k /k!.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose x is very close to 1, say x=0.99. Then for k=1, the probability is 0.99. For k=2, the probability that X1 + X2 ≤0.99 is 0.99^2 /2 ≈0.490, which is correct because the area under the line X1 + X2 =0.99 in the unit square is a triangle with area (0.99)^2 /2. But wait, 0.99^2 is approximately 0.98, so divided by 2 is 0.49, which is correct. If we compute the integral of the joint PDF over X1 + X2 ≤0.99, since X1 and X2 are independent uniform variables, the joint PDF is 1 over [0,1]^2. So integrating over X1 from 0 to 0.99, X2 from 0 to 0.99 - X1, which gives the area 0.99^2 /2. So that works.

Therefore, the formula holds for x in [0,1]. But wait, actually, the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution when x is in [0,1] is indeed x^k /k!.

So, given that, then P(M&gt;k) = x^k /k!.

But wait, let me check a different case. Suppose x=0.5 and k=3. Then P(M&gt;3) would be the probability that the sum of three uniforms is ≤0.5. The volume of the set {(x1, x2, x3) ∈ [0,1]^3 : x1 +x2 +x3 ≤0.5} is a tetrahedron with edge length 0.5, so its volume is (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208. Which is correct because integrating over x1 from 0 to 0.5, then x2 from 0 to 0.5 -x1, then x3 from 0 to 0.5 -x1 -x2. The triple integral would be:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1 -x2} dx3 dx2 dx1.

Which is equal to ∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2 dx1.

Let’s compute the inner integral:

∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2.

Let’s substitute u =0.5 -x1 -x2, then when x2=0, u=0.5 -x1, and when x2=0.5 -x1, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫_{u=0.5 -x1}^{0} u (-du) = ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} u du = [ (u^2)/2 ] from 0 to 0.5 -x1 = ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2.

Then the next integral is:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2 dx1.

Let’s substitute v=0.5 -x1, so when x1=0, v=0.5, and when x1=0.5, v=0. The integral becomes:

∫_{v=0.5}^{0} (v^2)/2 (-dv) = ∫_{0}^{0.5} (v^2)/2 dv = [ (v^3)/6 ] from 0 to 0.5 = (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208.

Which matches (0.5)^3 /3! =1/48. So that works. Therefore, the formula holds.

Therefore, the answer is P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. The question says &quot;non-negative integer k&quot;. So k can be zero? Let&#x27;s check.

If k=0, then P(M&gt;0) is the probability that M&gt;0. But M is defined as the minimum n≥1 such that the sum exceeds x. So M is always at least 1, because n starts at 1. Therefore, P(M&gt;0) should be 1, since M&gt;0 is always true. Let&#x27;s check the formula: x^0 /0! =1 /1=1. Correct.

For k=1, P(M&gt;1)=x /1 =x, which is correct as we saw earlier. So the formula works for k=0 as well.

Therefore, the general formula is P(M&gt;k) =x^k /k! for non-negative integers k, where 0 &lt;x &lt;1.

But wait, hold on. Let me check for k=2 and x=1. But x is strictly less than 1. The problem states 0 &lt;x &lt;1, so x=1 is excluded. But if x approaches 1, then P(M&gt;k) approaches 1^k /k! =1/k!.

But if x approaches 1, the probability that the sum of k uniforms is less than 1. However, for x=1 and k=2, the probability that the sum of two uniforms is less than 1 is 1/2, which is 1^2 /2!=1/2. Which is correct. Similarly, for k=3, x approaching 1, the probability approaches 1/6, which is correct.

Therefore, the formula holds even when x approaches 1, but since x is strictly less than 1, we don&#x27;t have to worry about the cases where x ≥1.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k) = \dfrac{x^k}{k!} for each non-negative integer k.

Wait, but I want to confirm once more.

Alternative approach: Let&#x27;s use recursion or generating functions. Let’s denote that P(M &gt;k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is ≤x. Let’s denote this probability as P_k(x). Then, for k=0, we have P_0(x)=1, since the sum of zero variables is 0, which is ≤x for x&gt;0. For k=1, P_1(x)=P(X1 ≤x)=x. For k=2, P_2(x)=P(X1 +X2 ≤x). As we saw, this is x^2 /2. Then, in general, P_k(x) = integral from 0 to x of P_{k-1}(x -t) dt, where t is the value of Xk. Since each Xi is uniform, the PDF of Xk is 1 on [0,1]. Therefore, P_k(x) = ∫_{0}^{x} P_{k-1}(x -t) dt.

Starting with P_0(x)=1, then:

P_1(x) = ∫_{0}^x P_0(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x 1 dt =x.

P_2(x)=∫_{0}^x P_1(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t) dt = [x t - t^2 /2 ] from 0 tox =x^2 -x^2 /2 =x^2 /2.

Similarly, P_3(x)=∫_{0}^x P_2(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 /2 dt = (1/2) ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 dt = (1/2)[ -(x -t)^3 /3 ] from 0 tox = (1/2)(x^3 /3 )=x^3 /6.

Continuing this way, we can see that P_k(x)=x^k /k!.

Therefore, by induction, if P_{k-1}(x)=x^{k-1}/(k-1)!, then P_k(x)=∫0^x t^{k-1}/(k-1)! dt =x^k /k!.

Hence, the formula holds. Therefore, the probability that M&gt;k is x^k /k!.

Yes, that seems to check out through induction as well.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

**Final Answer**
The probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is \boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \), we need to determine the probability that the sum of the first \( k \) uniform random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k \) on \([0, 1]\) is less than or equal to \( x \). This is equivalent to finding the probability that the minimum number \( M \) of variables needed to exceed \( x \) is greater than \( k \).

The sum \( S_k = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_k \) of \( k \) independent uniform random variables on \([0, 1]\) follows the Irwin–Hall distribution. For \( 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \), the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution simplifies to the volume of the \( k \)-dimensional simplex where each coordinate is non-negative and their sum is less than or equal to \( x \). This volume is given by \( \frac{x^k}{k!} \).

We can verify this result through induction:
- For \( k = 0 \), \( P(M &gt; 0) = 1 \), which matches \( \frac{x^0}{0!} = 1 \).
- For \( k = 1 \), \( P(M &gt; 1) = P(X_1 \leq x) = x \), which matches \( \frac{x^1}{1!} = x \).
- For \( k = 2 \), the probability that \( X_1 + X_2 \leq x \) is the area of a triangle with vertices \((0, 0)\), \((x, 0)\), and \((0, x)\), which is \( \frac{x^2}{2} \), matching \( \frac{x^2}{2!} \).

By induction, assuming \( P_{k-1}(x) = \frac{x^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \), we have:
\[ P_k(x) = \int_0^x P_{k-1}(x - t) \, dt = \int_0^x \frac{(x - t)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \, dt = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

Thus, the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is given by:
\[ P(M &gt; k) = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the probability that the minimum number of uniform random variables needed to exceed a certain threshold x is greater than k. In other words, P(M &gt; k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is still less than or equal to x. That makes sense because M is the first time the sum exceeds x, so if even after k variables the sum hasn&#x27;t exceeded x, then M must be greater than k.

Since each Xi is uniformly distributed on [0,1], their sum would follow some distribution. For independent uniform variables, the sum of n such variables is known to have an Irwin–Hall distribution. The probability that the sum of n uniform variables is less than or equal to x is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution. 

Wait, but the problem states that the variables are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform on [0,1], so the sum S_k = X1 + X2 + ... + Xk has a Irwin–Hall distribution. The CDF of S_k is given by:

P(S_k ≤ x) = (1/k!) * Σ_{i=0}^floor(x) (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (x - i)^k

But since x is between 0 and 1, and we are summing k variables each between 0 and 1, if x is in [0,1], then the sum S_k can range from 0 to k. However, if x is between 0 and 1, then floor(x) is 0 when x &lt; 1. Wait, hold on. Wait, x is a constant between 0 and 1, given. So we need the probability that the sum of k uniform variables is ≤ x. But each variable is at least 0, so the sum S_k is at least 0. But x is less than 1. So if we have k variables each at most 1, their sum can be up to k, but we are interested in the case where their sum is ≤ x &lt; 1.

But wait, if x is less than 1, then the maximum possible sum for k variables is k, but x is less than 1. So the event S_k ≤ x is equivalent to all variables being ≤ x and their sum ≤ x. Wait, no, that&#x27;s not necessarily the case. For example, if one variable is close to x and the others are zero, the sum can still be ≤ x. So actually, the event S_k ≤ x is the same as the sum of k non-negative numbers each ≤1 adding up to ≤x. Since x &lt; 1, all the variables must add up to something less than 1. 

But the variables are independent, so how do we compute the probability that their sum is ≤x? For x in [0,1], the volume of the k-dimensional simplex where each xi ≥0 and x1 + x2 + ... + xk ≤x. The volume of that region is x^k /k! . Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the volume (which corresponds to the probability since the variables are uniform) of the set {(x1, x2, ..., xk) ∈ [0,1]^k : x1 + ... + xk ≤x} is equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with edge length x, but constrained by each variable being at most 1. However, since x &lt;1 and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, the constraints xi ≤1 are automatically satisfied because each xi is non-negative and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, so each xi must be ≤x &lt;1. Therefore, the volume is indeed equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with side length x, which is x^k /k!.

So then, P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k! ?

Wait, but I thought the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution for n variables at x is (1/n!) Σ_{k=0}^floor(x)} (-1)^k C(n, k) (x -k)^n. But if x is in [0,1), then floor(x) =0, so the sum reduces to (1/n!)(x^n). So yes, in that case, P(S_n ≤x) = x^n /n!.

Wait, that seems right. So for example, when n=1, P(S_1 ≤x) = x, which is correct because X1 is uniform on [0,1]. For n=2, P(S_2 ≤x) = x^2 /2, which makes sense because the area under the line x1 + x2 =x in the unit square is a triangle with area x^2 /2. Similarly, for n=3, it&#x27;s a tetrahedron with volume x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!.

Therefore, in general, for x in [0,1), P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Therefore, since P(M &gt;k) = P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify with k=1. For k=1, P(M &gt;1) = P(X1 ≤x) = x, which matches x^1 /1! =x. For k=2, P(M&gt;2)=P(X1 + X2 ≤x). Since X1 and X2 are both uniform on [0,1], the probability that their sum is ≤x is the area of the triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,x), and (x,0). The area is (x^2)/2, which is x^2 /2! as per the formula. Similarly for k=3, it&#x27;s x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!. So yes, that seems to hold.

Therefore, the general formula for P(M&gt;k) when 0 &lt;x &lt;1 is x^k /k!.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose x is very close to 1, say x=0.99. Then for k=1, the probability is 0.99. For k=2, the probability that X1 + X2 ≤0.99 is 0.99^2 /2 ≈0.490, which is correct because the area under the line X1 + X2 =0.99 in the unit square is a triangle with area (0.99)^2 /2. But wait, 0.99^2 is approximately 0.98, so divided by 2 is 0.49, which is correct. If we compute the integral of the joint PDF over X1 + X2 ≤0.99, since X1 and X2 are independent uniform variables, the joint PDF is 1 over [0,1]^2. So integrating over X1 from 0 to 0.99, X2 from 0 to 0.99 - X1, which gives the area 0.99^2 /2. So that works.

Therefore, the formula holds for x in [0,1]. But wait, actually, the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution when x is in [0,1] is indeed x^k /k!.

So, given that, then P(M&gt;k) = x^k /k!.

But wait, let me check a different case. Suppose x=0.5 and k=3. Then P(M&gt;3) would be the probability that the sum of three uniforms is ≤0.5. The volume of the set {(x1, x2, x3) ∈ [0,1]^3 : x1 +x2 +x3 ≤0.5} is a tetrahedron with edge length 0.5, so its volume is (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208. Which is correct because integrating over x1 from 0 to 0.5, then x2 from 0 to 0.5 -x1, then x3 from 0 to 0.5 -x1 -x2. The triple integral would be:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1 -x2} dx3 dx2 dx1.

Which is equal to ∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2 dx1.

Let’s compute the inner integral:

∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2.

Let’s substitute u =0.5 -x1 -x2, then when x2=0, u=0.5 -x1, and when x2=0.5 -x1, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫_{u=0.5 -x1}^{0} u (-du) = ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} u du = [ (u^2)/2 ] from 0 to 0.5 -x1 = ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2.

Then the next integral is:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2 dx1.

Let’s substitute v=0.5 -x1, so when x1=0, v=0.5, and when x1=0.5, v=0. The integral becomes:

∫_{v=0.5}^{0} (v^2)/2 (-dv) = ∫_{0}^{0.5} (v^2)/2 dv = [ (v^3)/6 ] from 0 to 0.5 = (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208.

Which matches (0.5)^3 /3! =1/48. So that works. Therefore, the formula holds.

Therefore, the answer is P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. The question says &quot;non-negative integer k&quot;. So k can be zero? Let&#x27;s check.

If k=0, then P(M&gt;0) is the probability that M&gt;0. But M is defined as the minimum n≥1 such that the sum exceeds x. So M is always at least 1, because n starts at 1. Therefore, P(M&gt;0) should be 1, since M&gt;0 is always true. Let&#x27;s check the formula: x^0 /0! =1 /1=1. Correct.

For k=1, P(M&gt;1)=x /1 =x, which is correct as we saw earlier. So the formula works for k=0 as well.

Therefore, the general formula is P(M&gt;k) =x^k /k! for non-negative integers k, where 0 &lt;x &lt;1.

But wait, hold on. Let me check for k=2 and x=1. But x is strictly less than 1. The problem states 0 &lt;x &lt;1, so x=1 is excluded. But if x approaches 1, then P(M&gt;k) approaches 1^k /k! =1/k!.

But if x approaches 1, the probability that the sum of k uniforms is less than 1. However, for x=1 and k=2, the probability that the sum of two uniforms is less than 1 is 1/2, which is 1^2 /2!=1/2. Which is correct. Similarly, for k=3, x approaching 1, the probability approaches 1/6, which is correct.

Therefore, the formula holds even when x approaches 1, but since x is strictly less than 1, we don&#x27;t have to worry about the cases where x ≥1.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k) = \dfrac{x^k}{k!} for each non-negative integer k.

Wait, but I want to confirm once more.

Alternative approach: Let&#x27;s use recursion or generating functions. Let’s denote that P(M &gt;k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is ≤x. Let’s denote this probability as P_k(x). Then, for k=0, we have P_0(x)=1, since the sum of zero variables is 0, which is ≤x for x&gt;0. For k=1, P_1(x)=P(X1 ≤x)=x. For k=2, P_2(x)=P(X1 +X2 ≤x). As we saw, this is x^2 /2. Then, in general, P_k(x) = integral from 0 to x of P_{k-1}(x -t) dt, where t is the value of Xk. Since each Xi is uniform, the PDF of Xk is 1 on [0,1]. Therefore, P_k(x) = ∫_{0}^{x} P_{k-1}(x -t) dt.

Starting with P_0(x)=1, then:

P_1(x) = ∫_{0}^x P_0(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x 1 dt =x.

P_2(x)=∫_{0}^x P_1(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t) dt = [x t - t^2 /2 ] from 0 tox =x^2 -x^2 /2 =x^2 /2.

Similarly, P_3(x)=∫_{0}^x P_2(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 /2 dt = (1/2) ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 dt = (1/2)[ -(x -t)^3 /3 ] from 0 tox = (1/2)(x^3 /3 )=x^3 /6.

Continuing this way, we can see that P_k(x)=x^k /k!.

Therefore, by induction, if P_{k-1}(x)=x^{k-1}/(k-1)!, then P_k(x)=∫0^x t^{k-1}/(k-1)! dt =x^k /k!.

Hence, the formula holds. Therefore, the probability that M&gt;k is x^k /k!.

Yes, that seems to check out through induction as well.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

**Final Answer**
The probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is \boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \), we need to determine the probability that the sum of the first \( k \) uniform random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k \) on \([0, 1]\) is less than or equal to \( x \). This is equivalent to finding the probability that the minimum number \( M \) of variables needed to exceed \( x \) is greater than \( k \).

The sum \( S_k = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_k \) of \( k \) independent uniform random variables on \([0, 1]\) follows the Irwin–Hall distribution. For \( 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \), the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution simplifies to the volume of the \( k \)-dimensional simplex where each coordinate is non-negative and their sum is less than or equal to \( x \).

We can verify this result through induction:
- For \( k = 0 \), \( P(M &gt; 0) = 1 \), which matches \( \frac{x^0}{0!} = 1 \).
- For \( k = 1 \), \( P(M &gt; 1) = P(X_1 \leq x) = x \), which matches \( \frac{x^1}{1!} = x \).
- For \( k = 2 \), the probability that \( X_1 + X_2 \leq x \) is the area of a triangle with vertices \((0, 0)\), \((x, 0)\), and \((0, x)\), which is \( \frac{x^2}{2} \), matching \( \frac{x^2}{2!} \).

By induction, assuming \( P_{k-1}(x) = \frac{x^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \), we have:
\[ P_k(x) = \int_0^x P_{k-1}(x - t) \, dt = \int_0^x \frac{(x - t)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \, dt = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

Thus, the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is given by:
\[ P(M &gt; k) = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the probability that the minimum number of uniform random variables needed to exceed a certain threshold x is greater than k. In other words, P(M &gt; k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is still less than or equal to x. That makes sense because M is the first time the sum exceeds x, so if even after k variables the sum hasn&#x27;t exceeded x, then M must be greater than k.

Since each Xi is uniformly distributed on [0,1], their sum would follow some distribution. For independent uniform variables, the sum of n such variables is known to have an Irwin–Hall distribution. The probability that the sum of n uniform variables is less than or equal to x is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution. 

Wait, but the problem states that the variables are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform on [0,1], so the sum S_k = X1 + X2 + ... + Xk has a Irwin–Hall distribution. The CDF of S_k is given by:

P(S_k ≤ x) = (1/k!) * Σ_{i=0}^floor(x) (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (x - i)^k

But since x is between 0 and 1, and we are summing k variables each between 0 and 1, if x is in [0,1], then the sum S_k can range from 0 to k. However, if x is between 0 and 1, then floor(x) is 0 when x &lt; 1. Wait, hold on. Wait, x is a constant between 0 and 1, given. So we need the probability that the sum of k uniform variables is ≤ x. But each variable is at least 0, so the sum S_k is at least 0. But x is less than 1. So if we have k variables each at most 1, their sum can be up to k, but we are interested in the case where their sum is ≤ x &lt; 1.

But wait, if x is less than 1, then the maximum possible sum for k variables is k, but x is less than 1. So the event S_k ≤ x is equivalent to all variables being ≤ x and their sum ≤ x. Wait, no, that&#x27;s not necessarily the case. For example, if one variable is close to x and the others are zero, the sum can still be ≤ x. So actually, the event S_k ≤ x is the same as the sum of k non-negative numbers each ≤1 adding up to ≤x. Since x &lt; 1, all the variables must add up to something less than 1. 

But the variables are independent, so how do we compute the probability that their sum is ≤x? For x in [0,1], the volume of the k-dimensional simplex where each xi ≥0 and x1 + x2 + ... + xk ≤x. The volume of that region is x^k /k! . Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the volume (which corresponds to the probability since the variables are uniform) of the set {(x1, x2, ..., xk) ∈ [0,1]^k : x1 + ... + xk ≤x} is equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with edge length x, but constrained by each variable being at most 1. However, since x &lt;1 and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, the constraints xi ≤1 are automatically satisfied because each xi is non-negative and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, so each xi must be ≤x &lt;1. Therefore, the volume is indeed equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with side length x, which is x^k /k!.

So then, P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k! ?

Wait, but I thought the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution for n variables at x is (1/n!) Σ_{k=0}^floor(x)} (-1)^k C(n, k) (x -k)^n. But if x is in [0,1), then floor(x) =0, so the sum reduces to (1/n!)(x^n). So yes, in that case, P(S_n ≤x) = x^n /n!.

Wait, that seems right. So for example, when n=1, P(S_1 ≤x) = x, which is correct because X1 is uniform on [0,1]. For n=2, P(S_2 ≤x) = x^2 /2, which makes sense because the area under the line x1 + x2 =x in the unit square is a triangle with area x^2 /2. Similarly, for n=3, it&#x27;s a tetrahedron with volume x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!.

Therefore, in general, for x in [0,1), P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Therefore, since P(M &gt;k) = P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify with k=1. For k=1, P(M &gt;1) = P(X1 ≤x) = x, which matches x^1 /1! =x. For k=2, P(M&gt;2)=P(X1 + X2 ≤x). Since X1 and X2 are both uniform on [0,1], the probability that their sum is ≤x is the area of the triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,x), and (x,0). The area is (x^2)/2, which is x^2 /2! as per the formula. Similarly for k=3, it&#x27;s x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!. So yes, that seems to hold.

Therefore, the general formula for P(M&gt;k) when 0 &lt;x &lt;1 is x^k /k!.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose x is very close to 1, say x=0.99. Then for k=1, the probability is 0.99. For k=2, the probability that X1 + X2 ≤0.99 is 0.99^2 /2 ≈0.490, which is correct because the area under the line X1 + X2 =0.99 in the unit square is a triangle with area (0.99)^2 /2. But wait, 0.99^2 is approximately 0.98, so divided by 2 is 0.49, which is correct. If we compute the integral of the joint PDF over X1 + X2 ≤0.99, since X1 and X2 are independent uniform variables, the joint PDF is 1 over [0,1]^2. So integrating over X1 from 0 to 0.99, X2 from 0 to 0.99 - X1, which gives the area 0.99^2 /2. So that works.

Therefore, the formula holds for x in [0,1]. But wait, actually, the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution when x is in [0,1] is indeed x^k /k!.

So, given that, then P(M&gt;k) = x^k /k!.

But wait, let me check a different case. Suppose x=0.5 and k=3. Then P(M&gt;3) would be the probability that the sum of three uniforms is ≤0.5. The volume of the set {(x1, x2, x3) ∈ [0,1]^3 : x1 +x2 +x3 ≤0.5} is a tetrahedron with edge length 0.5, so its volume is (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208. Which is correct because integrating over x1 from 0 to 0.5, then x2 from 0 to 0.5 -x1, then x3 from 0 to 0.5 -x1 -x2. The triple integral would be:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1 -x2} dx3 dx2 dx1.

Which is equal to ∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2 dx1.

Let’s compute the inner integral:

∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2.

Let’s substitute u =0.5 -x1 -x2, then when x2=0, u=0.5 -x1, and when x2=0.5 -x1, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫_{u=0.5 -x1}^{0} u (-du) = ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} u du = [ (u^2)/2 ] from 0 to 0.5 -x1 = ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2.

Then the next integral is:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2 dx1.

Let’s substitute v=0.5 -x1, so when x1=0, v=0.5, and when x1=0.5, v=0. The integral becomes:

∫_{v=0.5}^{0} (v^2)/2 (-dv) = ∫_{0}^{0.5} (v^2)/2 dv = [ (v^3)/6 ] from 0 to 0.5 = (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208.

Which matches (0.5)^3 /3! =1/48. So that works. Therefore, the formula holds.

Therefore, the answer is P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. The question says &quot;non-negative integer k&quot;. So k can be zero? Let&#x27;s check.

If k=0, then P(M&gt;0) is the probability that M&gt;0. But M is defined as the minimum n≥1 such that the sum exceeds x. So M is always at least 1, because n starts at 1. Therefore, P(M&gt;0) should be 1, since M&gt;0 is always true. Let&#x27;s check the formula: x^0 /0! =1 /1=1. Correct.

For k=1, P(M&gt;1)=x /1 =x, which is correct as we saw earlier. So the formula works for k=0 as well.

Therefore, the general formula is P(M&gt;k) =x^k /k! for non-negative integers k, where 0 &lt;x &lt;1.

But wait, hold on. Let me check for k=2 and x=1. But x is strictly less than 1. The problem states 0 &lt;x &lt;1, so x=1 is excluded. But if x approaches 1, then P(M&gt;k) approaches 1^k /k! =1/k!.

But if x approaches 1, the probability that the sum of k uniforms is less than 1. However, for x=1 and k=2, the probability that the sum of two uniforms is less than 1 is 1/2, which is 1^2 /2!=1/2. Which is correct. Similarly, for k=3, x approaching 1, the probability approaches 1/6, which is correct.

Therefore, the formula holds even when x approaches 1, but since x is strictly less than 1, we don&#x27;t have to worry about the cases where x ≥1.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k) = \dfrac{x^k}{k!} for each non-negative integer k.

Wait, but I want to confirm once more.

Alternative approach: Let&#x27;s use recursion or generating functions. Let’s denote that P(M &gt;k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is ≤x. Let’s denote this probability as P_k(x). Then, for k=0, we have P_0(x)=1, since the sum of zero variables is 0, which is ≤x for x&gt;0. For k=1, P_1(x)=P(X1 ≤x)=x. For k=2, P_2(x)=P(X1 +X2 ≤x). As we saw, this is x^2 /2. Then, in general, P_k(x) = integral from 0 to x of P_{k-1}(x -t) dt, where t is the value of Xk. Since each Xi is uniform, the PDF of Xk is 1 on [0,1]. Therefore, P_k(x) = ∫_{0}^{x} P_{k-1}(x -t) dt.

Starting with P_0(x)=1, then:

P_1(x) = ∫_{0}^x P_0(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x 1 dt =x.

P_2(x)=∫_{0}^x P_1(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t) dt = [x t - t^2 /2 ] from 0 tox =x^2 -x^2 /2 =x^2 /2.

Similarly, P_3(x)=∫_{0}^x P_2(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 /2 dt = (1/2) ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 dt = (1/2)[ -(x -t)^3 /3 ] from 0 tox = (1/2)(x^3 /3 )=x^3 /6.

Continuing this way, we can see that P_k(x)=x^k /k!.

Therefore, by induction, if P_{k-1}(x)=x^{k-1}/(k-1)!, then P_k(x)=∫0^x t^{k-1}/(k-1)! dt =x^k /k!.

Hence, the formula holds. Therefore, the probability that M&gt;k is x^k /k!.

Yes, that seems to check out through induction as well.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

**Final Answer**
The probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is \boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \), we need to determine the probability that the sum of the first \( k \) uniform random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k \) on \([0, 1]\) is less than or equal to \( x \). This is equivalent to finding the probability that the minimum number \( M \) of variables needed to exceed \( x \) is greater than \( k \).

The sum \( S_k = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_k \) of \( k \) independent uniform random variables on \([0, 1]\) follows the Irwin–Hall distribution. For \( 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \), the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution simplifies to the volume of the \( k \)-dimensional simplex where each coordinate is non-negative and their sum is less than or equal to \( x \). This volume is given by \( \frac{x^k}{k!} \).

We can verify this result through induction:
- For \( k = 0 \), \( P(M &gt; 0) = 1 \), which matches \( \frac{x^0}{0!} = 1 \).
- For \( k = 1 \), \( P(M &gt; 1) = P(X_1 \leq x) = x \), which matches \( \frac{x^1}{1!} = x \).
- For \( k = 2 \), the probability that \( X_1 + X_2 \leq x \) is the area of a triangle with vertices \((0, 0)\), \((x, 0)\), and \((0, x)\), which is \( \frac{x^2}{2} \), matching \( \frac{x^2}{2!} \).

By induction, assuming \( P_{k-1}(x) = \frac{x^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \), we have:
\[ P_k(x) = \int_0^x P_{k-1}(x - t) \, dt = \int_0^x \frac{(x - t)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \, dt = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

Thus, the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is given by:
\[ P(M &gt; k) = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}\).          </p>

Since each Xi is uniformly distributed on [0,1], their sum would follow some distribution. For independent uniform variables, the sum of n such variables is known to have an Irwin–Hall distribution. The probability that the sum of n uniform variables is less than or equal to x is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution. 

Wait, but the problem states that the variables are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform on [0,1], so the sum S_k = X1 + X2 + ... + Xk has a Irwin–Hall distribution. The CDF of S_k is given by:

P(S_k ≤ x) = (1/k!) * Σ_{i=0}^floor(x) (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (x - i)^k

But since x is between 0 and 1, and we are summing k variables each between 0 and 1, if x is in [0,1], then the sum S_k can range from 0 to k. However, if x is between 0 and 1, then floor(x) is 0 when x &lt; 1. Wait, hold on. Wait, x is a constant between 0 and 1, given. So we need the probability that the sum of k uniform variables is ≤ x. But each variable is at least 0, so the sum S_k is at least 0. But x is less than 1. So if we have k variables each at most 1, their sum can be up to k, but we are interested in the case where their sum is ≤ x &lt; 1.

But wait, if x is less than 1, then the maximum possible sum for k variables is k, but x is less than 1. So the event S_k ≤ x is equivalent to all variables being ≤ x and their sum ≤ x. Wait, no, that&#x27;s not necessarily the case. For example, if one variable is close to x and the others are zero, the sum can still be ≤ x. So actually, the event S_k ≤ x is the same as the sum of k non-negative numbers each ≤1 adding up to ≤x. Since x &lt; 1, all the variables must add up to something less than 1. 

But the variables are independent, so how do we compute the probability that their sum is ≤x? For x in [0,1], the volume of the k-dimensional simplex where each xi ≥0 and x1 + x2 + ... + xk ≤x. The volume of that region is x^k /k! . Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the volume (which corresponds to the probability since the variables are uniform) of the set {(x1, x2, ..., xk) ∈ [0,1]^k : x1 + ... + xk ≤x} is equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with edge length x, but constrained by each variable being at most 1. However, since x &lt;1 and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, the constraints xi ≤1 are automatically satisfied because each xi is non-negative and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, so each xi must be ≤x &lt;1. Therefore, the volume is indeed equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with side length x, which is x^k /k!.

So then, P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k! ?

Wait, but I thought the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution for n variables at x is (1/n!) Σ_{k=0}^floor(x)} (-1)^k C(n, k) (x -k)^n. But if x is in [0,1), then floor(x) =0, so the sum reduces to (1/n!)(x^n). So yes, in that case, P(S_n ≤x) = x^n /n!.

Wait, that seems right. So for example, when n=1, P(S_1 ≤x) = x, which is correct because X1 is uniform on [0,1]. For n=2, P(S_2 ≤x) = x^2 /2, which makes sense because the area under the line x1 + x2 =x in the unit square is a triangle with area x^2 /2. Similarly, for n=3, it&#x27;s a tetrahedron with volume x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!.

Therefore, in general, for x in [0,1), P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Therefore, since P(M &gt;k) = P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify with k=1. For k=1, P(M &gt;1) = P(X1 ≤x) = x, which matches x^1 /1! =x. For k=2, P(M&gt;2)=P(X1 + X2 ≤x). Since X1 and X2 are both uniform on [0,1], the probability that their sum is ≤x is the area of the triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,x), and (x,0). The area is (x^2)/2, which is x^2 /2! as per the formula. Similarly for k=3, it&#x27;s x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!. So yes, that seems to hold.

Therefore, the general formula for P(M&gt;k) when 0 &lt;x &lt;1 is x^k /k!.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose x is very close to 1, say x=0.99. Then for k=1, the probability is 0.99. For k=2, the probability that X1 + X2 ≤0.99 is 0.99^2 /2 ≈0.490, which is correct because the area under the line X1 + X2 =0.99 in the unit square is a triangle with area (0.99)^2 /2. But wait, 0.99^2 is approximately 0.98, so divided by 2 is 0.49, which is correct. If we compute the integral of the joint PDF over X1 + X2 ≤0.99, since X1 and X2 are independent uniform variables, the joint PDF is 1 over [0,1]^2. So integrating over X1 from 0 to 0.99, X2 from 0 to 0.99 - X1, which gives the area 0.99^2 /2. So that works.

Therefore, the formula holds for x in [0,1]. But wait, actually, the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution when x is in [0,1] is indeed x^k /k!.

So, given that, then P(M&gt;k) = x^k /k!.

But wait, let me check a different case. Suppose x=0.5 and k=3. Then P(M&gt;3) would be the probability that the sum of three uniforms is ≤0.5. The volume of the set {(x1, x2, x3) ∈ [0,1]^3 : x1 +x2 +x3 ≤0.5} is a tetrahedron with edge length 0.5, so its volume is (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208. Which is correct because integrating over x1 from 0 to 0.5, then x2 from 0 to 0.5 -x1, then x3 from 0 to 0.5 -x1 -x2. The triple integral would be:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1 -x2} dx3 dx2 dx1.

Which is equal to ∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2 dx1.

Let’s compute the inner integral:

∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2.

Let’s substitute u =0.5 -x1 -x2, then when x2=0, u=0.5 -x1, and when x2=0.5 -x1, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫_{u=0.5 -x1}^{0} u (-du) = ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} u du = [ (u^2)/2 ] from 0 to 0.5 -x1 = ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2.

Then the next integral is:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2 dx1.

Let’s substitute v=0.5 -x1, so when x1=0, v=0.5, and when x1=0.5, v=0. The integral becomes:

∫_{v=0.5}^{0} (v^2)/2 (-dv) = ∫_{0}^{0.5} (v^2)/2 dv = [ (v^3)/6 ] from 0 to 0.5 = (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208.

Which matches (0.5)^3 /3! =1/48. So that works. Therefore, the formula holds.

Therefore, the answer is P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. The question says &quot;non-negative integer k&quot;. So k can be zero? Let&#x27;s check.

If k=0, then P(M&gt;0) is the probability that M&gt;0. But M is defined as the minimum n≥1 such that the sum exceeds x. So M is always at least 1, because n starts at 1. Therefore, P(M&gt;0) should be 1, since M&gt;0 is always true. Let&#x27;s check the formula: x^0 /0! =1 /1=1. Correct.

For k=1, P(M&gt;1)=x /1 =x, which is correct as we saw earlier. So the formula works for k=0 as well.

Therefore, the general formula is P(M&gt;k) =x^k /k! for non-negative integers k, where 0 &lt;x &lt;1.

But wait, hold on. Let me check for k=2 and x=1. But x is strictly less than 1. The problem states 0 &lt;x &lt;1, so x=1 is excluded. But if x approaches 1, then P(M&gt;k) approaches 1^k /k! =1/k!.

But if x approaches 1, the probability that the sum of k uniforms is less than 1. However, for x=1 and k=2, the probability that the sum of two uniforms is less than 1 is 1/2, which is 1^2 /2!=1/2. Which is correct. Similarly, for k=3, x approaching 1, the probability approaches 1/6, which is correct.

Therefore, the formula holds even when x approaches 1, but since x is strictly less than 1, we don&#x27;t have to worry about the cases where x ≥1.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k) = \dfrac{x^k}{k!} for each non-negative integer k.

Wait, but I want to confirm once more.

Alternative approach: Let&#x27;s use recursion or generating functions. Let’s denote that P(M &gt;k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is ≤x. Let’s denote this probability as P_k(x). Then, for k=0, we have P_0(x)=1, since the sum of zero variables is 0, which is ≤x for x&gt;0. For k=1, P_1(x)=P(X1 ≤x)=x. For k=2, P_2(x)=P(X1 +X2 ≤x). As we saw, this is x^2 /2. Then, in general, P_k(x) = integral from 0 to x of P_{k-1}(x -t) dt, where t is the value of Xk. Since each Xi is uniform, the PDF of Xk is 1 on [0,1]. Therefore, P_k(x) = ∫_{0}^{x} P_{k-1}(x -t) dt.

Starting with P_0(x)=1, then:

P_1(x) = ∫_{0}^x P_0(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x 1 dt =x.

P_2(x)=∫_{0}^x P_1(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t) dt = [x t - t^2 /2 ] from 0 tox =x^2 -x^2 /2 =x^2 /2.

Similarly, P_3(x)=∫_{0}^x P_2(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 /2 dt = (1/2) ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 dt = (1/2)[ -(x -t)^3 /3 ] from 0 tox = (1/2)(x^3 /3 )=x^3 /6.

Continuing this way, we can see that P_k(x)=x^k /k!.

Therefore, by induction, if P_{k-1}(x)=x^{k-1}/(k-1)!, then P_k(x)=∫0^x t^{k-1}/(k-1)! dt =x^k /k!.

Hence, the formula holds. Therefore, the probability that M&gt;k is x^k /k!.

Yes, that seems to check out through induction as well.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

**Final Answer**
The probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is \boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \), we need to determine the probability that the sum of the first \( k \) uniform random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k \) on \([0, 1]\) is less than or equal to \( x \). This is equivalent to finding the probability that the minimum number \( M \) of variables needed to exceed \( x \) is greater than \( k \).

The sum \( S_k = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_k \) of \( k \) independent uniform random variables on \([0, 1]\) follows the Irwin–Hall distribution. For \( 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \), the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution simplifies to the volume of the \( k \)-dimensional simplex where each coordinate is non-negative and their sum is less than or equal to \( x \). This volume is given by \( \frac{x^k}{k!} \).

We can verify this result through induction:
- For \( k = 0 \), \( P(M &gt; 0) = 1 \), which matches \( \frac{x^0}{0!} = 1 \).
- For \( k = 1 \), \( P(M &gt; 1) = P(X_1 \leq x) = x \), which matches \( \frac{x^1}{1!} = x \).
- For \( k = 2 \), the probability that \( X_1 + X_2 \leq x \) is the area of a triangle with vertices \((0, 0)\), \((x, 0)\), and \((0, x)\), which is \( \frac{x^2}{2} \), matching \( \frac{x^2}{2!} \).

By induction, assuming \( P_{k-1}(x) = \frac{x^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \), we have:
\[ P_k(x) = \int_0^x P_{k-1}(x - t) \, dt = \int_0^x \frac{(x - t)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \, dt = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

Thus, the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is given by:
\[ P(M &gt; k) = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the probability that the minimum number of uniform random variables needed to exceed a certain threshold x is greater than k. In other words, P(M &gt; k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is still less than or equal to x. That makes sense because M is the first time the sum exceeds x, so if even after k variables the sum hasn&#x27;t exceeded x, then M must be greater than k.

Since each Xi is uniformly distributed on [0,1], their sum would follow some distribution. For independent uniform variables, the sum of n such variables is known to have an Irwin–Hall distribution. The probability that the sum of n uniform variables is less than or equal to x is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution. 

Wait, but the problem states that the variables are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform on [0,1], so the sum S_k = X1 + X2 + ... + Xk has a Irwin–Hall distribution. The CDF of S_k is given by:

P(S_k ≤ x) = (1/k!) * Σ_{i=0}^floor(x) (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (x - i)^k

But since x is between 0 and 1, and we are summing k variables each between 0 and 1, if x is in [0,1], then the sum S_k can range from 0 to k. However, if x is between 0 and 1, then floor(x) is 0 when x &lt; 1. Wait, hold on. Wait, x is a constant between 0 and 1, given. So we need the probability that the sum of k uniform variables is ≤ x. But each variable is at least 0, so the sum S_k is at least 0. But x is less than 1. So if we have k variables each at most 1, their sum can be up to k, but we are interested in the case where their sum is ≤ x &lt; 1.

But wait, if x is less than 1, then the maximum possible sum for k variables is k, but x is less than 1. So the event S_k ≤ x is equivalent to all variables being ≤ x and their sum ≤ x. Wait, no, that&#x27;s not necessarily the case. For example, if one variable is close to x and the others are zero, the sum can still be ≤ x. So actually, the event S_k ≤ x is the same as the sum of k non-negative numbers each ≤1 adding up to ≤x. Since x &lt; 1, all the variables must add up to something less than 1. 

But the variables are independent, so how do we compute the probability that their sum is ≤x? For x in [0,1], the volume of the k-dimensional simplex where each xi ≥0 and x1 + x2 + ... + xk ≤x. The volume of that region is x^k /k! . Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the volume (which corresponds to the probability since the variables are uniform) of the set {(x1, x2, ..., xk) ∈ [0,1]^k : x1 + ... + xk ≤x} is equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with edge length x, but constrained by each variable being at most 1. However, since x &lt;1 and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, the constraints xi ≤1 are automatically satisfied because each xi is non-negative and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, so each xi must be ≤x &lt;1. Therefore, the volume is indeed equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with side length x, which is x^k /k!.

So then, P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k! ?

Wait, but I thought the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution for n variables at x is (1/n!) Σ_{k=0}^floor(x)} (-1)^k C(n, k) (x -k)^n. But if x is in [0,1), then floor(x) =0, so the sum reduces to (1/n!)(x^n). So yes, in that case, P(S_n ≤x) = x^n /n!.

Wait, that seems right. So for example, when n=1, P(S_1 ≤x) = x, which is correct because X1 is uniform on [0,1]. For n=2, P(S_2 ≤x) = x^2 /2, which makes sense because the area under the line x1 + x2 =x in the unit square is a triangle with area x^2 /2. Similarly, for n=3, it&#x27;s a tetrahedron with volume x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!.

Therefore, in general, for x in [0,1), P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Therefore, since P(M &gt;k) = P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify with k=1. For k=1, P(M &gt;1) = P(X1 ≤x) = x, which matches x^1 /1! =x. For k=2, P(M&gt;2)=P(X1 + X2 ≤x). Since X1 and X2 are both uniform on [0,1], the probability that their sum is ≤x is the area of the triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,x), and (x,0). The area is (x^2)/2, which is x^2 /2! as per the formula. Similarly for k=3, it&#x27;s x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!. So yes, that seems to hold.

Therefore, the general formula for P(M&gt;k) when 0 &lt;x &lt;1 is x^k /k!.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose x is very close to 1, say x=0.99. Then for k=1, the probability is 0.99. For k=2, the probability that X1 + X2 ≤0.99 is 0.99^2 /2 ≈0.490, which is correct because the area under the line X1 + X2 =0.99 in the unit square is a triangle with area (0.99)^2 /2. But wait, 0.99^2 is approximately 0.98, so divided by 2 is 0.49, which is correct. If we compute the integral of the joint PDF over X1 + X2 ≤0.99, since X1 and X2 are independent uniform variables, the joint PDF is 1 over [0,1]^2. So integrating over X1 from 0 to 0.99, X2 from 0 to 0.99 - X1, which gives the area 0.99^2 /2. So that works.

Therefore, the formula holds for x in [0,1]. But wait, actually, the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution when x is in [0,1] is indeed x^k /k!.

So, given that, then P(M&gt;k) = x^k /k!.

But wait, let me check a different case. Suppose x=0.5 and k=3. Then P(M&gt;3) would be the probability that the sum of three uniforms is ≤0.5. The volume of the set {(x1, x2, x3) ∈ [0,1]^3 : x1 +x2 +x3 ≤0.5} is a tetrahedron with edge length 0.5, so its volume is (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208. Which is correct because integrating over x1 from 0 to 0.5, then x2 from 0 to 0.5 -x1, then x3 from 0 to 0.5 -x1 -x2. The triple integral would be:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1 -x2} dx3 dx2 dx1.

Which is equal to ∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2 dx1.

Let’s compute the inner integral:

∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2.

Let’s substitute u =0.5 -x1 -x2, then when x2=0, u=0.5 -x1, and when x2=0.5 -x1, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫_{u=0.5 -x1}^{0} u (-du) = ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} u du = [ (u^2)/2 ] from 0 to 0.5 -x1 = ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2.

Then the next integral is:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2 dx1.

Let’s substitute v=0.5 -x1, so when x1=0, v=0.5, and when x1=0.5, v=0. The integral becomes:

∫_{v=0.5}^{0} (v^2)/2 (-dv) = ∫_{0}^{0.5} (v^2)/2 dv = [ (v^3)/6 ] from 0 to 0.5 = (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208.

Which matches (0.5)^3 /3! =1/48. So that works. Therefore, the formula holds.

Therefore, the answer is P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. The question says &quot;non-negative integer k&quot;. So k can be zero? Let&#x27;s check.

If k=0, then P(M&gt;0) is the probability that M&gt;0. But M is defined as the minimum n≥1 such that the sum exceeds x. So M is always at least 1, because n starts at 1. Therefore, P(M&gt;0) should be 1, since M&gt;0 is always true. Let&#x27;s check the formula: x^0 /0! =1 /1=1. Correct.

For k=1, P(M&gt;1)=x /1 =x, which is correct as we saw earlier. So the formula works for k=0 as well.

Therefore, the general formula is P(M&gt;k) =x^k /k! for non-negative integers k, where 0 &lt;x &lt;1.

But wait, hold on. Let me check for k=2 and x=1. But x is strictly less than 1. The problem states 0 &lt;x &lt;1, so x=1 is excluded. But if x approaches 1, then P(M&gt;k) approaches 1^k /k! =1/k!.

But if x approaches 1, the probability that the sum of k uniforms is less than 1. However, for x=1 and k=2, the probability that the sum of two uniforms is less than 1 is 1/2, which is 1^2 /2!=1/2. Which is correct. Similarly, for k=3, x approaching 1, the probability approaches 1/6, which is correct.

Therefore, the formula holds even when x approaches 1, but since x is strictly less than 1, we don&#x27;t have to worry about the cases where x ≥1.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k) = \dfrac{x^k}{k!} for each non-negative integer k.

Wait, but I want to confirm once more.

Alternative approach: Let&#x27;s use recursion or generating functions. Let’s denote that P(M &gt;k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is ≤x. Let’s denote this probability as P_k(x). Then, for k=0, we have P_0(x)=1, since the sum of zero variables is 0, which is ≤x for x&gt;0. For k=1, P_1(x)=P(X1 ≤x)=x. For k=2, P_2(x)=P(X1 +X2 ≤x). As we saw, this is x^2 /2. Then, in general, P_k(x) = integral from 0 to x of P_{k-1}(x -t) dt, where t is the value of Xk. Since each Xi is uniform, the PDF of Xk is 1 on [0,1]. Therefore, P_k(x) = ∫_{0}^{x} P_{k-1}(x -t) dt.

Starting with P_0(x)=1, then:

P_1(x) = ∫_{0}^x P_0(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x 1 dt =x.

P_2(x)=∫_{0}^x P_1(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t) dt = [x t - t^2 /2 ] from 0 tox =x^2 -x^2 /2 =x^2 /2.

Similarly, P_3(x)=∫_{0}^x P_2(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 /2 dt = (1/2) ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 dt = (1/2)[ -(x -t)^3 /3 ] from 0 tox = (1/2)(x^3 /3 )=x^3 /6.

Continuing this way, we can see that P_k(x)=x^k /k!.

Therefore, by induction, if P_{k-1}(x)=x^{k-1}/(k-1)!, then P_k(x)=∫0^x t^{k-1}/(k-1)! dt =x^k /k!.

Hence, the formula holds. Therefore, the probability that M&gt;k is x^k /k!.

Yes, that seems to check out through induction as well.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

**Final Answer**
The probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is \boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \), we need to determine the probability that the sum of the first \( k \) uniform random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k \) on \([0, 1]\) is less than or equal to \( x \).

\[ P_k(x) = \int_0^x P_{k-1}(x - t) \, dt = \int_0^x \frac{(x - t)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \, dt = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

Thus, the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is given by:

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the probability that the minimum number of uniform random variables needed to exceed a certain threshold x is greater than k.

That makes sense because M is the first time the sum exceeds x, so if even after k variables the sum hasn&#x27;t exceeded x, then M must be greater than k.

Since each Xi is uniformly distributed on [0,1], their sum would follow some distribution. For independent uniform variables, the sum of n such variables is known to have an Irwin–Hall distribution. The probability that the sum of n uniform variables is less than or equal to x is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution. 

Wait, but the problem states that the variables are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform on [0,1], so the sum S_k = X1 + X2 + ... + Xk has a Irwin–Hall distribution. The CDF of S_k is given by:

P(S_k ≤ x) = (1/k!) * Σ_{i=0}^floor(x) (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (x - i)^k

But since x is between 0 and 1, and we are summing k variables each between 0 and 1, if x is in [0,1], then the sum S_k can range from 0 to k. However, if x is between 0 and 1, then floor(x) is 0 when x &lt; 1. Wait, hold on. Wait, x is a constant between 0 and 1, given. So we need the probability that the sum of k uniform variables is ≤ x. But each variable is at least 0, so the sum S_k is at least 0. But x is less than 1. So if we have k variables each at most 1, their sum can be up to k, but we are interested in the case where their sum is ≤ x &lt; 1.

But wait, if x is less than 1, then the maximum possible sum for k variables is k, but x is less than 1. So the event S_k ≤ x is equivalent to all variables being ≤ x and their sum ≤ x. Wait, no, that&#x27;s not necessarily the case. For example, if one variable is close to x and the others are zero, the sum can still be ≤ x. So actually, the event S_k ≤ x is the same as the sum of k non-negative numbers each ≤1 adding up to ≤x. Since x &lt; 1, all the variables must add up to something less than 1. 

But the variables are independent, so how do we compute the probability that their sum is ≤x? For x in [0,1], the volume of the k-dimensional simplex where each xi ≥0 and x1 + x2 + ... + xk ≤x. The volume of that region is x^k /k! . Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the volume (which corresponds to the probability since the variables are uniform) of the set {(x1, x2, ..., xk) ∈ [0,1]^k : x1 + ... + xk ≤x} is equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with edge length x, but constrained by each variable being at most 1. However, since x &lt;1 and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, the constraints xi ≤1 are automatically satisfied because each xi is non-negative and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, so each xi must be ≤x &lt;1. Therefore, the volume is indeed equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with side length x, which is x^k /k!.

So then, P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k! ?

Wait, but I thought the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution for n variables at x is (1/n!) Σ_{k=0}^floor(x)} (-1)^k C(n, k) (x -k)^n. But if x is in [0,1), then floor(x) =0, so the sum reduces to (1/n!)(x^n). So yes, in that case, P(S_n ≤x) = x^n /n!.

Wait, that seems right. So for example, when n=1, P(S_1 ≤x) = x, which is correct because X1 is uniform on [0,1]. For n=2, P(S_2 ≤x) = x^2 /2, which makes sense because the area under the line x1 + x2 =x in the unit square is a triangle with area x^2 /2. Similarly, for n=3, it&#x27;s a tetrahedron with volume x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!.

Therefore, in general, for x in [0,1), P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Therefore, since P(M &gt;k) = P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify with k=1. For k=1, P(M &gt;1) = P(X1 ≤x) = x, which matches x^1 /1! =x. For k=2, P(M&gt;2)=P(X1 + X2 ≤x). Since X1 and X2 are both uniform on [0,1], the probability that their sum is ≤x is the area of the triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,x), and (x,0). The area is (x^2)/2, which is x^2 /2! as per the formula. Similarly for k=3, it&#x27;s x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!. So yes, that seems to hold.

Therefore, the general formula for P(M&gt;k) when 0 &lt;x &lt;1 is x^k /k!.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose x is very close to 1, say x=0.99. Then for k=1, the probability is 0.99. For k=2, the probability that X1 + X2 ≤0.99 is 0.99^2 /2 ≈0.490, which is correct because the area under the line X1 + X2 =0.99 in the unit square is a triangle with area (0.99)^2 /2. But wait, 0.99^2 is approximately 0.98, so divided by 2 is 0.49, which is correct. If we compute the integral of the joint PDF over X1 + X2 ≤0.99, since X1 and X2 are independent uniform variables, the joint PDF is 1 over [0,1]^2. So integrating over X1 from 0 to 0.99, X2 from 0 to 0.99 - X1, which gives the area 0.99^2 /2. So that works.

Therefore, the formula holds for x in [0,1]. But wait, actually, the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution when x is in [0,1] is indeed x^k /k!.

So, given that, then P(M&gt;k) = x^k /k!.

But wait, let me check a different case. Suppose x=0.5 and k=3. Then P(M&gt;3) would be the probability that the sum of three uniforms is ≤0.5. The volume of the set {(x1, x2, x3) ∈ [0,1]^3 : x1 +x2 +x3 ≤0.5} is a tetrahedron with edge length 0.5, so its volume is (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208. Which is correct because integrating over x1 from 0 to 0.5, then x2 from 0 to 0.5 -x1, then x3 from 0 to 0.5 -x1 -x2. The triple integral would be:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1 -x2} dx3 dx2 dx1.

Which is equal to ∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2 dx1.

Let’s compute the inner integral:

∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2.

Let’s substitute u =0.5 -x1 -x2, then when x2=0, u=0.5 -x1, and when x2=0.5 -x1, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫_{u=0.5 -x1}^{0} u (-du) = ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} u du = [ (u^2)/2 ] from 0 to 0.5 -x1 = ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2.

Then the next integral is:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2 dx1.

Let’s substitute v=0.5 -x1, so when x1=0, v=0.5, and when x1=0.5, v=0. The integral becomes:

∫_{v=0.5}^{0} (v^2)/2 (-dv) = ∫_{0}^{0.5} (v^2)/2 dv = [ (v^3)/6 ] from 0 to 0.5 = (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208.

Which matches (0.5)^3 /3! =1/48. So that works. Therefore, the formula holds.

Therefore, the answer is P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. The question says &quot;non-negative integer k&quot;. So k can be zero? Let&#x27;s check.

If k=0, then P(M&gt;0) is the probability that M&gt;0. But M is defined as the minimum n≥1 such that the sum exceeds x. So M is always at least 1, because n starts at 1. Therefore, P(M&gt;0) should be 1, since M&gt;0 is always true. Let&#x27;s check the formula: x^0 /0! =1 /1=1. Correct.

For k=1, P(M&gt;1)=x /1 =x, which is correct as we saw earlier. So the formula works for k=0 as well.

Therefore, the general formula is P(M&gt;k) =x^k /k! for non-negative integers k, where 0 &lt;x &lt;1.

But wait, hold on. Let me check for k=2 and x=1. But x is strictly less than 1. The problem states 0 &lt;x &lt;1, so x=1 is excluded. But if x approaches 1, then P(M&gt;k) approaches 1^k /k! =1/k!.

But if x approaches 1, the probability that the sum of k uniforms is less than 1. However, for x=1 and k=2, the probability that the sum of two uniforms is less than 1 is 1/2, which is 1^2 /2!=1/2. Which is correct. Similarly, for k=3, x approaching 1, the probability approaches 1/6, which is correct.

Therefore, the formula holds even when x approaches 1, but since x is strictly less than 1, we don&#x27;t have to worry about the cases where x ≥1.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k) = \dfrac{x^k}{k!} for each non-negative integer k.

Wait, but I want to confirm once more.

Alternative approach: Let&#x27;s use recursion or generating functions. Let’s denote that P(M &gt;k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is ≤x. Let’s denote this probability as P_k(x). Then, for k=0, we have P_0(x)=1, since the sum of zero variables is 0, which is ≤x for x&gt;0. For k=1, P_1(x)=P(X1 ≤x)=x. For k=2, P_2(x)=P(X1 +X2 ≤x). As we saw, this is x^2 /2. Then, in general, P_k(x) = integral from 0 to x of P_{k-1}(x -t) dt, where t is the value of Xk. Since each Xi is uniform, the PDF of Xk is 1 on [0,1]. Therefore, P_k(x) = ∫_{0}^{x} P_{k-1}(x -t) dt.

Starting with P_0(x)=1, then:

P_1(x) = ∫_{0}^x P_0(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x 1 dt =x.

P_2(x)=∫_{0}^x P_1(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t) dt = [x t - t^2 /2 ] from 0 tox =x^2 -x^2 /2 =x^2 /2.

Similarly, P_3(x)=∫_{0}^x P_2(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 /2 dt = (1/2) ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 dt = (1/2)[ -(x -t)^3 /3 ] from 0 tox = (1/2)(x^3 /3 )=x^3 /6.

Continuing this way, we can see that P_k(x)=x^k /k!.

Therefore, by induction, if P_{k-1}(x)=x^{k-1}/(k-1)!, then P_k(x)=∫0^x t^{k-1}/(k-1)! dt =x^k /k!.

Hence, the formula holds. Therefore, the probability that M&gt;k is x^k /k!.

Yes, that seems to check out through induction as well.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

**Final Answer**
The probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is \boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \), we need to determine the probability that the sum of the first \( k \) uniform random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k \) on \([0, 1]\) is less than or equal to \( x \). This is equivalent to finding the probability that the minimum number \( M \) of variables needed to exceed \( x \) is greater than \( k \).

The sum \( S_k = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_k \) of \( k \) independent uniform random variables on \([0, 1]\) follows the Irwin–Hall distribution. For \( 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \), the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution simplifies to the volume of the \( k \)-dimensional simplex where each coordinate is non-negative and their sum is less than or equal to \( x \). This volume is given by \( \frac{x^k}{k!} \).

We can verify this result through induction:
- For \( k = 0 \), \( P(M &gt; 0) = 1 \), which matches \( \frac{x^0}{0!} = 1 \).
- For \( k = 1 \), \( P(M &gt; 1) = P(X_1 \leq x) = x \), which matches \( \frac{x^1}{1!} = x \).
- For \( k = 2 \), the probability that \( X_1 + X_2 \leq x \) is the area of a triangle with vertices \((0, 0)\), \((x, 0)\), and \((0, x)\), which is \( \frac{x^2}{2} \), matching \( \frac{x^2}{2!} \).

By induction, assuming \( P_{k-1}(x) = \frac{x^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \), we have:
\[ P_k(x) = \int_0^x P_{k-1}(x - t) \, dt = \int_0^x \frac{(x - t)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \, dt = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

Thus, the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is given by:
\[ P(M &gt; k) = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the probability that the minimum number of uniform random variables needed to exceed a certain threshold x is greater than k. In other words, P(M &gt; k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is still less than or equal to x. That makes sense because M is the first time the sum exceeds x, so if even after k variables the sum hasn&#x27;t exceeded x, then M must be greater than k.

Since each Xi is uniformly distributed on [0,1], their sum would follow some distribution. For independent uniform variables, the sum of n such variables is known to have an Irwin–Hall distribution. The probability that the sum of n uniform variables is less than or equal to x is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution. 

Wait, but the problem states that the variables are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform on [0,1], so the sum S_k = X1 + X2 + ... + Xk has a Irwin–Hall distribution. The CDF of S_k is given by:

P(S_k ≤ x) = (1/k!) * Σ_{i=0}^floor(x) (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (x - i)^k

But since x is between 0 and 1, and we are summing k variables each between 0 and 1, if x is in [0,1], then the sum S_k can range from 0 to k. However, if x is between 0 and 1, then floor(x) is 0 when x &lt; 1. Wait, hold on. Wait, x is a constant between 0 and 1, given. So we need the probability that the sum of k uniform variables is ≤ x. But each variable is at least 0, so the sum S_k is at least 0. But x is less than 1. So if we have k variables each at most 1, their sum can be up to k, but we are interested in the case where their sum is ≤ x &lt; 1.

But wait, if x is less than 1, then the maximum possible sum for k variables is k, but x is less than 1. So the event S_k ≤ x is equivalent to all variables being ≤ x and their sum ≤ x. Wait, no, that&#x27;s not necessarily the case. For example, if one variable is close to x and the others are zero, the sum can still be ≤ x. So actually, the event S_k ≤ x is the same as the sum of k non-negative numbers each ≤1 adding up to ≤x. Since x &lt; 1, all the variables must add up to something less than 1. 

But the variables are independent, so how do we compute the probability that their sum is ≤x? For x in [0,1], the volume of the k-dimensional simplex where each xi ≥0 and x1 + x2 + ... + xk ≤x. The volume of that region is x^k /k! . Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the volume (which corresponds to the probability since the variables are uniform) of the set {(x1, x2, ..., xk) ∈ [0,1]^k : x1 + ... + xk ≤x} is equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with edge length x, but constrained by each variable being at most 1. However, since x &lt;1 and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, the constraints xi ≤1 are automatically satisfied because each xi is non-negative and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, so each xi must be ≤x &lt;1. Therefore, the volume is indeed equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with side length x, which is x^k /k!.

So then, P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k! ?

Wait, but I thought the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution for n variables at x is (1/n!) Σ_{k=0}^floor(x)} (-1)^k C(n, k) (x -k)^n. But if x is in [0,1), then floor(x) =0, so the sum reduces to (1/n!)(x^n). So yes, in that case, P(S_n ≤x) = x^n /n!.

Wait, that seems right. So for example, when n=1, P(S_1 ≤x) = x, which is correct because X1 is uniform on [0,1]. For n=2, P(S_2 ≤x) = x^2 /2, which makes sense because the area under the line x1 + x2 =x in the unit square is a triangle with area x^2 /2. Similarly, for n=3, it&#x27;s a tetrahedron with volume x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!.

Therefore, in general, for x in [0,1), P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Therefore, since P(M &gt;k) = P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify with k=1. For k=1, P(M &gt;1) = P(X1 ≤x) = x, which matches x^1 /1! =x. For k=2, P(M&gt;2)=P(X1 + X2 ≤x). Since X1 and X2 are both uniform on [0,1], the probability that their sum is ≤x is the area of the triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,x), and (x,0). The area is (x^2)/2, which is x^2 /2! as per the formula. Similarly for k=3, it&#x27;s x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!. So yes, that seems to hold.

Therefore, the general formula for P(M&gt;k) when 0 &lt;x &lt;1 is x^k /k!.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose x is very close to 1, say x=0.99. Then for k=1, the probability is 0.99. For k=2, the probability that X1 + X2 ≤0.99 is 0.99^2 /2 ≈0.490, which is correct because the area under the line X1 + X2 =0.99 in the unit square is a triangle with area (0.99)^2 /2. But wait, 0.99^2 is approximately 0.98, so divided by 2 is 0.49, which is correct. If we compute the integral of the joint PDF over X1 + X2 ≤0.99, since X1 and X2 are independent uniform variables, the joint PDF is 1 over [0,1]^2. So integrating over X1 from 0 to 0.99, X2 from 0 to 0.99 - X1, which gives the area 0.99^2 /2. So that works.

Therefore, the formula holds for x in [0,1]. But wait, actually, the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution when x is in [0,1] is indeed x^k /k!.

So, given that, then P(M&gt;k) = x^k /k!.

But wait, let me check a different case. Suppose x=0.5 and k=3. Then P(M&gt;3) would be the probability that the sum of three uniforms is ≤0.5. The volume of the set {(x1, x2, x3) ∈ [0,1]^3 : x1 +x2 +x3 ≤0.5} is a tetrahedron with edge length 0.5, so its volume is (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208. Which is correct because integrating over x1 from 0 to 0.5, then x2 from 0 to 0.5 -x1, then x3 from 0 to 0.5 -x1 -x2. The triple integral would be:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1 -x2} dx3 dx2 dx1.

Which is equal to ∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2 dx1.

Let’s compute the inner integral:

∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2.

Let’s substitute u =0.5 -x1 -x2, then when x2=0, u=0.5 -x1, and when x2=0.5 -x1, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫_{u=0.5 -x1}^{0} u (-du) = ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} u du = [ (u^2)/2 ] from 0 to 0.5 -x1 = ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2.

Then the next integral is:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2 dx1.

Let’s substitute v=0.5 -x1, so when x1=0, v=0.5, and when x1=0.5, v=0. The integral becomes:

∫_{v=0.5}^{0} (v^2)/2 (-dv) = ∫_{0}^{0.5} (v^2)/2 dv = [ (v^3)/6 ] from 0 to 0.5 = (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208.

Which matches (0.5)^3 /3! =1/48. So that works. Therefore, the formula holds.

Therefore, the answer is P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. The question says &quot;non-negative integer k&quot;. So k can be zero? Let&#x27;s check.

If k=0, then P(M&gt;0) is the probability that M&gt;0. But M is defined as the minimum n≥1 such that the sum exceeds x. So M is always at least 1, because n starts at 1. Therefore, P(M&gt;0) should be 1, since M&gt;0 is always true. Let&#x27;s check the formula: x^0 /0! =1 /1=1. Correct.

For k=1, P(M&gt;1)=x /1 =x, which is correct as we saw earlier. So the formula works for k=0 as well.

Therefore, the general formula is P(M&gt;k) =x^k /k! for non-negative integers k, where 0 &lt;x &lt;1.

But wait, hold on. Let me check for k=2 and x=1. But x is strictly less than 1. The problem states 0 &lt;x &lt;1, so x=1 is excluded. But if x approaches 1, then P(M&gt;k) approaches 1^k /k! =1/k!.

But if x approaches 1, the probability that the sum of k uniforms is less than 1. However, for x=1 and k=2, the probability that the sum of two uniforms is less than 1 is 1/2, which is 1^2 /2!=1/2. Which is correct. Similarly, for k=3, x approaching 1, the probability approaches 1/6, which is correct.

Therefore, the formula holds even when x approaches 1, but since x is strictly less than 1, we don&#x27;t have to worry about the cases where x ≥1.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k) = \dfrac{x^k}{k!} for each non-negative integer k.

Wait, but I want to confirm once more.

Alternative approach: Let&#x27;s use recursion or generating functions. Let’s denote that P(M &gt;k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is ≤x. Let’s denote this probability as P_k(x). Then, for k=0, we have P_0(x)=1, since the sum of zero variables is 0, which is ≤x for x&gt;0. For k=1, P_1(x)=P(X1 ≤x)=x. For k=2, P_2(x)=P(X1 +X2 ≤x). As we saw, this is x^2 /2. Then, in general, P_k(x) = integral from 0 to x of P_{k-1}(x -t) dt, where t is the value of Xk. Since each Xi is uniform, the PDF of Xk is 1 on [0,1]. Therefore, P_k(x) = ∫_{0}^{x} P_{k-1}(x -t) dt.

Starting with P_0(x)=1, then:

P_1(x) = ∫_{0}^x P_0(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x 1 dt =x.

P_2(x)=∫_{0}^x P_1(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t) dt = [x t - t^2 /2 ] from 0 tox =x^2 -x^2 /2 =x^2 /2.

Similarly, P_3(x)=∫_{0}^x P_2(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 /2 dt = (1/2) ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 dt = (1/2)[ -(x -t)^3 /3 ] from 0 tox = (1/2)(x^3 /3 )=x^3 /6.

Continuing this way, we can see that P_k(x)=x^k /k!.

Therefore, by induction, if P_{k-1}(x)=x^{k-1}/(k-1)!, then P_k(x)=∫0^x t^{k-1}/(k-1)! dt =x^k /k!.

Hence, the formula holds. Therefore, the probability that M&gt;k is x^k /k!.

Yes, that seems to check out through induction as well.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

**Final Answer**
The probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is \boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \), we need to determine the probability that the sum of the first \( k \) uniform random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k \) on \([0, 1]\) is less than or equal to \( x \). This is equivalent to finding the probability that the minimum number \( M \) of variables needed to exceed \( x \) is greater than \( k \).

The sum \( S_k = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_k \) of \( k \) independent uniform random variables on \([0, 1]\) follows the Irwin–Hall distribution. For \( 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \), the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution simplifies to the volume of the \( k \)-dimensional simplex where each coordinate is non-negative and their sum is less than or equal to \( x \). This volume is given by \( \frac{x^k}{k!} \).

We can verify this result through induction:
- For \( k = 0 \), \( P(M &gt; 0) = 1 \), which matches \( \frac{x^0}{0!} = 1 \).
- For \( k = 1 \), \( P(M &gt; 1) = P(X_1 \leq x) = x \), which matches \( \frac{x^1}{1!} = x \).
- For \( k = 2 \), the probability that \( X_1 + X_2 \leq x \) is the area of a triangle with vertices \((0, 0)\), \((x, 0)\), and \((0, x)\), which is \( \frac{x^2}{2} \), matching \( \frac{x^2}{2!} \).

By induction, assuming \( P_{k-1}(x) = \frac{x^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \), we have:
\[ P_k(x) = \int_0^x P_{k-1}(x - t) \, dt = \int_0^x \frac{(x - t)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \, dt = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

Thus, the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is given by:
\[ P(M &gt; k) = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the probability that the minimum number of uniform random variables needed to exceed a certain threshold x is greater than k.

Since each Xi is uniformly distributed on [0,1], their sum would follow some distribution. For independent uniform variables, the sum of n such variables is known to have an Irwin–Hall distribution. The probability that the sum of n uniform variables is less than or equal to x is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution. 

Wait, but the problem states that the variables are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform on [0,1], so the sum S_k = X1 + X2 + ... + Xk has a Irwin–Hall distribution. The CDF of S_k is given by:

P(S_k ≤ x) = (1/k!) * Σ_{i=0}^floor(x) (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (x - i)^k

But since x is between 0 and 1, and we are summing k variables each between 0 and 1, if x is in [0,1], then the sum S_k can range from 0 to k. However, if x is between 0 and 1, then floor(x) is 0 when x &lt; 1. Wait, hold on. Wait, x is a constant between 0 and 1, given. So we need the probability that the sum of k uniform variables is ≤ x. But each variable is at least 0, so the sum S_k is at least 0. But x is less than 1. So if we have k variables each at most 1, their sum can be up to k, but we are interested in the case where their sum is ≤ x &lt; 1.

But wait, if x is less than 1, then the maximum possible sum for k variables is k, but x is less than 1. So the event S_k ≤ x is equivalent to all variables being ≤ x and their sum ≤ x. Wait, no, that&#x27;s not necessarily the case. For example, if one variable is close to x and the others are zero, the sum can still be ≤ x. So actually, the event S_k ≤ x is the same as the sum of k non-negative numbers each ≤1 adding up to ≤x. Since x &lt; 1, all the variables must add up to something less than 1. 

But the variables are independent, so how do we compute the probability that their sum is ≤x? For x in [0,1], the volume of the k-dimensional simplex where each xi ≥0 and x1 + x2 + ... + xk ≤x. The volume of that region is x^k /k! . Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the volume (which corresponds to the probability since the variables are uniform) of the set {(x1, x2, ..., xk) ∈ [0,1]^k : x1 + ... + xk ≤x} is equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with edge length x, but constrained by each variable being at most 1. However, since x &lt;1 and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, the constraints xi ≤1 are automatically satisfied because each xi is non-negative and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, so each xi must be ≤x &lt;1. Therefore, the volume is indeed equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with side length x, which is x^k /k!.

So then, P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k! ?

Wait, but I thought the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution for n variables at x is (1/n!) Σ_{k=0}^floor(x)} (-1)^k C(n, k) (x -k)^n. But if x is in [0,1), then floor(x) =0, so the sum reduces to (1/n!)(x^n). So yes, in that case, P(S_n ≤x) = x^n /n!.

Wait, that seems right. So for example, when n=1, P(S_1 ≤x) = x, which is correct because X1 is uniform on [0,1]. For n=2, P(S_2 ≤x) = x^2 /2, which makes sense because the area under the line x1 + x2 =x in the unit square is a triangle with area x^2 /2. Similarly, for n=3, it&#x27;s a tetrahedron with volume x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!.

Therefore, in general, for x in [0,1), P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Therefore, since P(M &gt;k) = P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify with k=1. For k=1, P(M &gt;1) = P(X1 ≤x) = x, which matches x^1 /1! =x. For k=2, P(M&gt;2)=P(X1 + X2 ≤x). Since X1 and X2 are both uniform on [0,1], the probability that their sum is ≤x is the area of the triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,x), and (x,0). The area is (x^2)/2, which is x^2 /2! as per the formula. Similarly for k=3, it&#x27;s x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!. So yes, that seems to hold.

Therefore, the general formula for P(M&gt;k) when 0 &lt;x &lt;1 is x^k /k!.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose x is very close to 1, say x=0.99. Then for k=1, the probability is 0.99. For k=2, the probability that X1 + X2 ≤0.99 is 0.99^2 /2 ≈0.490, which is correct because the area under the line X1 + X2 =0.99 in the unit square is a triangle with area (0.99)^2 /2. But wait, 0.99^2 is approximately 0.98, so divided by 2 is 0.49, which is correct. If we compute the integral of the joint PDF over X1 + X2 ≤0.99, since X1 and X2 are independent uniform variables, the joint PDF is 1 over [0,1]^2. So integrating over X1 from 0 to 0.99, X2 from 0 to 0.99 - X1, which gives the area 0.99^2 /2. So that works.

Therefore, the formula holds for x in [0,1]. But wait, actually, the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution when x is in [0,1] is indeed x^k /k!.

So, given that, then P(M&gt;k) = x^k /k!.

But wait, let me check a different case. Suppose x=0.5 and k=3. Then P(M&gt;3) would be the probability that the sum of three uniforms is ≤0.5. The volume of the set {(x1, x2, x3) ∈ [0,1]^3 : x1 +x2 +x3 ≤0.5} is a tetrahedron with edge length 0.5, so its volume is (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208. Which is correct because integrating over x1 from 0 to 0.5, then x2 from 0 to 0.5 -x1, then x3 from 0 to 0.5 -x1 -x2. The triple integral would be:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1 -x2} dx3 dx2 dx1.

Which is equal to ∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2 dx1.

Let’s compute the inner integral:

∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2.

Let’s substitute u =0.5 -x1 -x2, then when x2=0, u=0.5 -x1, and when x2=0.5 -x1, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫_{u=0.5 -x1}^{0} u (-du) = ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} u du = [ (u^2)/2 ] from 0 to 0.5 -x1 = ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2.

Then the next integral is:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2 dx1.

Let’s substitute v=0.5 -x1, so when x1=0, v=0.5, and when x1=0.5, v=0. The integral becomes:

∫_{v=0.5}^{0} (v^2)/2 (-dv) = ∫_{0}^{0.5} (v^2)/2 dv = [ (v^3)/6 ] from 0 to 0.5 = (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208.

Which matches (0.5)^3 /3! =1/48. So that works. Therefore, the formula holds.

Therefore, the answer is P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. The question says &quot;non-negative integer k&quot;. So k can be zero? Let&#x27;s check.

If k=0, then P(M&gt;0) is the probability that M&gt;0. But M is defined as the minimum n≥1 such that the sum exceeds x. So M is always at least 1, because n starts at 1. Therefore, P(M&gt;0) should be 1, since M&gt;0 is always true. Let&#x27;s check the formula: x^0 /0! =1 /1=1. Correct.

For k=1, P(M&gt;1)=x /1 =x, which is correct as we saw earlier. So the formula works for k=0 as well.

Therefore, the general formula is P(M&gt;k) =x^k /k! for non-negative integers k, where 0 &lt;x &lt;1.

But wait, hold on. Let me check for k=2 and x=1. But x is strictly less than 1. The problem states 0 &lt;x &lt;1, so x=1 is excluded. But if x approaches 1, then P(M&gt;k) approaches 1^k /k! =1/k!.

But if x approaches 1, the probability that the sum of k uniforms is less than 1. However, for x=1 and k=2, the probability that the sum of two uniforms is less than 1 is 1/2, which is 1^2 /2!=1/2. Which is correct. Similarly, for k=3, x approaching 1, the probability approaches 1/6, which is correct.

Therefore, the formula holds even when x approaches 1, but since x is strictly less than 1, we don&#x27;t have to worry about the cases where x ≥1.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k) = \dfrac{x^k}{k!} for each non-negative integer k.

Wait, but I want to confirm once more.

Alternative approach: Let&#x27;s use recursion or generating functions. Let’s denote that P(M &gt;k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is ≤x. Let’s denote this probability as P_k(x). Then, for k=0, we have P_0(x)=1, since the sum of zero variables is 0, which is ≤x for x&gt;0. For k=1, P_1(x)=P(X1 ≤x)=x. For k=2, P_2(x)=P(X1 +X2 ≤x). As we saw, this is x^2 /2. Then, in general, P_k(x) = integral from 0 to x of P_{k-1}(x -t) dt, where t is the value of Xk. Since each Xi is uniform, the PDF of Xk is 1 on [0,1]. Therefore, P_k(x) = ∫_{0}^{x} P_{k-1}(x -t) dt.

Starting with P_0(x)=1, then:

P_1(x) = ∫_{0}^x P_0(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x 1 dt =x.

P_2(x)=∫_{0}^x P_1(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t) dt = [x t - t^2 /2 ] from 0 tox =x^2 -x^2 /2 =x^2 /2.

Similarly, P_3(x)=∫_{0}^x P_2(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 /2 dt = (1/2) ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 dt = (1/2)[ -(x -t)^3 /3 ] from 0 tox = (1/2)(x^3 /3 )=x^3 /6.

Continuing this way, we can see that P_k(x)=x^k /k!.

Therefore, by induction, if P_{k-1}(x)=x^{k-1}/(k-1)!, then P_k(x)=∫0^x t^{k-1}/(k-1)! dt =x^k /k!.

Hence, the formula holds. Therefore, the probability that M&gt;k is x^k /k!.

Yes, that seems to check out through induction as well.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

**Final Answer**
The probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is \boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \), we need to determine the probability that the sum of the first \( k \) uniform random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k \) on \([0, 1]\) is less than or equal to \( x \). This is equivalent to finding the probability that the minimum number \( M \) of variables needed to exceed \( x \) is greater than \( k \).

The sum \( S_k = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_k \) of \( k \) independent uniform random variables on \([0, 1]\) follows the Irwin–Hall distribution. For \( 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \), the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution simplifies to the volume of the \( k \)-dimensional simplex where each coordinate is non-negative and their sum is less than or equal to \( x \). This volume is given by \( \frac{x^k}{k!} \).

We can verify this result through induction:
- For \( k = 0 \), \( P(M &gt; 0) = 1 \), which matches \( \frac{x^0}{0!} = 1 \).
- For \( k = 1 \), \( P(M &gt; 1) = P(X_1 \leq x) = x \), which matches \( \frac{x^1}{1!} = x \).
- For \( k = 2 \), the probability that \( X_1 + X_2 \leq x \) is the area of a triangle with vertices \((0, 0)\), \((x, 0)\), and \((0, x)\), which is \( \frac{x^2}{2} \), matching \( \frac{x^2}{2!} \).

By induction, assuming \( P_{k-1}(x) = \frac{x^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \), we have:
\[ P_k(x) = \int_0^x P_{k-1}(x - t) \, dt = \int_0^x \frac{(x - t)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \, dt = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

Thus, the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is given by:
\[ P(M &gt; k) = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the probability that the minimum number of uniform random variables needed to exceed a certain threshold x is greater than k. In other words, P(M &gt; k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is still less than or equal to x. That makes sense because M is the first time the sum exceeds x, so if even after k variables the sum hasn&#x27;t exceeded x, then M must be greater than k.

Since each Xi is uniformly distributed on [0,1], their sum would follow some distribution. For independent uniform variables, the sum of n such variables is known to have an Irwin–Hall distribution. The probability that the sum of n uniform variables is less than or equal to x is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution. 

Wait, but the problem states that the variables are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform on [0,1], so the sum S_k = X1 + X2 + ... + Xk has a Irwin–Hall distribution. The CDF of S_k is given by:

P(S_k ≤ x) = (1/k!) * Σ_{i=0}^floor(x) (-1)^i * C(k, i) * (x - i)^k

But since x is between 0 and 1, and we are summing k variables each between 0 and 1, if x is in [0,1], then the sum S_k can range from 0 to k. However, if x is between 0 and 1, then floor(x) is 0 when x &lt; 1. Wait, hold on. Wait, x is a constant between 0 and 1, given. So we need the probability that the sum of k uniform variables is ≤ x. But each variable is at least 0, so the sum S_k is at least 0. But x is less than 1. So if we have k variables each at most 1, their sum can be up to k, but we are interested in the case where their sum is ≤ x &lt; 1.

But wait, if x is less than 1, then the maximum possible sum for k variables is k, but x is less than 1. So the event S_k ≤ x is equivalent to all variables being ≤ x and their sum ≤ x. Wait, no, that&#x27;s not necessarily the case. For example, if one variable is close to x and the others are zero, the sum can still be ≤ x. So actually, the event S_k ≤ x is the same as the sum of k non-negative numbers each ≤1 adding up to ≤x. Since x &lt; 1, all the variables must add up to something less than 1. 

But the variables are independent, so how do we compute the probability that their sum is ≤x? For x in [0,1], the volume of the k-dimensional simplex where each xi ≥0 and x1 + x2 + ... + xk ≤x. The volume of that region is x^k /k! . Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the volume (which corresponds to the probability since the variables are uniform) of the set {(x1, x2, ..., xk) ∈ [0,1]^k : x1 + ... + xk ≤x} is equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with edge length x, but constrained by each variable being at most 1. However, since x &lt;1 and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, the constraints xi ≤1 are automatically satisfied because each xi is non-negative and the sum is ≤x &lt;1, so each xi must be ≤x &lt;1. Therefore, the volume is indeed equal to the volume of the k-dimensional simplex with side length x, which is x^k /k!.

So then, P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k! ?

Wait, but I thought the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution for n variables at x is (1/n!) Σ_{k=0}^floor(x)} (-1)^k C(n, k) (x -k)^n. But if x is in [0,1), then floor(x) =0, so the sum reduces to (1/n!)(x^n). So yes, in that case, P(S_n ≤x) = x^n /n!.

Wait, that seems right. So for example, when n=1, P(S_1 ≤x) = x, which is correct because X1 is uniform on [0,1]. For n=2, P(S_2 ≤x) = x^2 /2, which makes sense because the area under the line x1 + x2 =x in the unit square is a triangle with area x^2 /2. Similarly, for n=3, it&#x27;s a tetrahedron with volume x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!.

Therefore, in general, for x in [0,1), P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Therefore, since P(M &gt;k) = P(S_k ≤x) = x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify with k=1. For k=1, P(M &gt;1) = P(X1 ≤x) = x, which matches x^1 /1! =x. For k=2, P(M&gt;2)=P(X1 + X2 ≤x). Since X1 and X2 are both uniform on [0,1], the probability that their sum is ≤x is the area of the triangle with vertices (0,0), (0,x), and (x,0). The area is (x^2)/2, which is x^2 /2! as per the formula. Similarly for k=3, it&#x27;s x^3 /6, which is x^3 /3!. So yes, that seems to hold.

Therefore, the general formula for P(M&gt;k) when 0 &lt;x &lt;1 is x^k /k!.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose x is very close to 1, say x=0.99. Then for k=1, the probability is 0.99. For k=2, the probability that X1 + X2 ≤0.99 is 0.99^2 /2 ≈0.490, which is correct because the area under the line X1 + X2 =0.99 in the unit square is a triangle with area (0.99)^2 /2. But wait, 0.99^2 is approximately 0.98, so divided by 2 is 0.49, which is correct. If we compute the integral of the joint PDF over X1 + X2 ≤0.99, since X1 and X2 are independent uniform variables, the joint PDF is 1 over [0,1]^2. So integrating over X1 from 0 to 0.99, X2 from 0 to 0.99 - X1, which gives the area 0.99^2 /2. So that works.

Therefore, the formula holds for x in [0,1]. But wait, actually, the formula for the CDF of the Irwin–Hall distribution when x is in [0,1] is indeed x^k /k!.

So, given that, then P(M&gt;k) = x^k /k!.

But wait, let me check a different case. Suppose x=0.5 and k=3. Then P(M&gt;3) would be the probability that the sum of three uniforms is ≤0.5. The volume of the set {(x1, x2, x3) ∈ [0,1]^3 : x1 +x2 +x3 ≤0.5} is a tetrahedron with edge length 0.5, so its volume is (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208. Which is correct because integrating over x1 from 0 to 0.5, then x2 from 0 to 0.5 -x1, then x3 from 0 to 0.5 -x1 -x2. The triple integral would be:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1 -x2} dx3 dx2 dx1.

Which is equal to ∫_{0}^{0.5} ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2 dx1.

Let’s compute the inner integral:

∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} (0.5 -x1 -x2) dx2.

Let’s substitute u =0.5 -x1 -x2, then when x2=0, u=0.5 -x1, and when x2=0.5 -x1, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫_{u=0.5 -x1}^{0} u (-du) = ∫_{0}^{0.5 -x1} u du = [ (u^2)/2 ] from 0 to 0.5 -x1 = ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2.

Then the next integral is:

∫_{0}^{0.5} ( (0.5 -x1)^2 ) /2 dx1.

Let’s substitute v=0.5 -x1, so when x1=0, v=0.5, and when x1=0.5, v=0. The integral becomes:

∫_{v=0.5}^{0} (v^2)/2 (-dv) = ∫_{0}^{0.5} (v^2)/2 dv = [ (v^3)/6 ] from 0 to 0.5 = (0.5)^3 /6 =1/48 ≈0.0208.

Which matches (0.5)^3 /3! =1/48. So that works. Therefore, the formula holds.

Therefore, the answer is P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

Wait, but hold on. The question says &quot;non-negative integer k&quot;. So k can be zero? Let&#x27;s check.

If k=0, then P(M&gt;0) is the probability that M&gt;0. But M is defined as the minimum n≥1 such that the sum exceeds x. So M is always at least 1, because n starts at 1. Therefore, P(M&gt;0) should be 1, since M&gt;0 is always true. Let&#x27;s check the formula: x^0 /0! =1 /1=1. Correct.

For k=1, P(M&gt;1)=x /1 =x, which is correct as we saw earlier. So the formula works for k=0 as well.

Therefore, the general formula is P(M&gt;k) =x^k /k! for non-negative integers k, where 0 &lt;x &lt;1.

But wait, hold on. Let me check for k=2 and x=1. But x is strictly less than 1. The problem states 0 &lt;x &lt;1, so x=1 is excluded. But if x approaches 1, then P(M&gt;k) approaches 1^k /k! =1/k!.

But if x approaches 1, the probability that the sum of k uniforms is less than 1. However, for x=1 and k=2, the probability that the sum of two uniforms is less than 1 is 1/2, which is 1^2 /2!=1/2. Which is correct. Similarly, for k=3, x approaching 1, the probability approaches 1/6, which is correct.

Therefore, the formula holds even when x approaches 1, but since x is strictly less than 1, we don&#x27;t have to worry about the cases where x ≥1.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k) = \dfrac{x^k}{k!} for each non-negative integer k.

Wait, but I want to confirm once more.

Alternative approach: Let&#x27;s use recursion or generating functions. Let’s denote that P(M &gt;k) is the probability that the sum of the first k variables is ≤x. Let’s denote this probability as P_k(x). Then, for k=0, we have P_0(x)=1, since the sum of zero variables is 0, which is ≤x for x&gt;0. For k=1, P_1(x)=P(X1 ≤x)=x. For k=2, P_2(x)=P(X1 +X2 ≤x). As we saw, this is x^2 /2. Then, in general, P_k(x) = integral from 0 to x of P_{k-1}(x -t) dt, where t is the value of Xk. Since each Xi is uniform, the PDF of Xk is 1 on [0,1]. Therefore, P_k(x) = ∫_{0}^{x} P_{k-1}(x -t) dt.

Starting with P_0(x)=1, then:

P_1(x) = ∫_{0}^x P_0(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x 1 dt =x.

P_2(x)=∫_{0}^x P_1(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t) dt = [x t - t^2 /2 ] from 0 tox =x^2 -x^2 /2 =x^2 /2.

Similarly, P_3(x)=∫_{0}^x P_2(x -t) dt = ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 /2 dt = (1/2) ∫_{0}^x (x -t)^2 dt = (1/2)[ -(x -t)^3 /3 ] from 0 tox = (1/2)(x^3 /3 )=x^3 /6.

Continuing this way, we can see that P_k(x)=x^k /k!.

Therefore, by induction, if P_{k-1}(x)=x^{k-1}/(k-1)!, then P_k(x)=∫0^x t^{k-1}/(k-1)! dt =x^k /k!.

Hence, the formula holds. Therefore, the probability that M&gt;k is x^k /k!.

Yes, that seems to check out through induction as well.

Therefore, the answer should be P(M&gt;k)=x^k /k!.

**Final Answer**
The probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is \boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \), we need to determine the probability that the sum of the first \( k \) uniform random variables \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k \) on \([0, 1]\) is less than or equal to \( x \). This is equivalent to finding the probability that the minimum number \( M \) of variables needed to exceed \( x \) is greater than \( k \).

The sum \( S_k = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots + X_k \) of \( k \) independent uniform random variables on \([0, 1]\) follows the Irwin–Hall distribution. For \( 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 \), the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Irwin–Hall distribution simplifies to the volume of the \( k \)-dimensional simplex where each coordinate is non-negative and their sum is less than or equal to \( x \). This volume is given by \( \frac{x^k}{k!} \).

We can verify this result through induction:
- For \( k = 0 \), \( P(M &gt; 0) = 1 \), which matches \( \frac{x^0}{0!} = 1 \).
- For \( k = 1 \), \( P(M &gt; 1) = P(X_1 \leq x) = x \), which matches \( \frac{x^1}{1!} = x \).
- For \( k = 2 \), the probability that \( X_1 + X_2 \leq x \) is the area of a triangle with vertices \((0, 0)\), \((x, 0)\), and \((0, x)\), which is \( \frac{x^2}{2} \), matching \( \frac{x^2}{2!} \).

By induction, assuming \( P_{k-1}(x) = \frac{x^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \), we have:
\[ P_k(x) = \int_0^x P_{k-1}(x - t) \, dt = \int_0^x \frac{(x - t)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} \, dt = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

Thus, the probability \( P(M &gt; k) \) is given by:
\[ P(M &gt; k) = \frac{x^k}{k!} \]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{x^k}{k!}}\).          </p>

Problem: Show that \( \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \left( 1 - (1 - s) \frac{\lambda_n}{n}\right)^n - \left( 1 - (1 - s) \frac{\lambda}{n}\right)^n \right| \le \lim_{n \to \infty} | 1 - s | | \lambda_n - \lambda | = 0 \). This is an application of the convergence theorem in probability, demonstrating that the generating function of a sequence of binomially distributed random variables converges to the generating function of the Poisson distribution.

Response: Since \( p_1 = 1 - s \), we have \(1 - s &gt; 0 \), so \( | 1 - s | &gt; 0 \). Also, \( \lambda_n - \lambda = 0 \) so \( \lambda_n = \lambda \). \boxed{0}          </p>

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s see. I need to show that the limit of the absolute difference between two expressions is less than or equal to the limit of |1 - s| |λₙ - λ|, which is zero. And this is related to the convergence of generating functions from binomial to Poisson distributions. Hmm, okay.

First, let me parse the problem. The main inequality to show is:

limₙ→∞ |(1 - (1 - s)(λₙ/n))ⁿ - (1 - (1 - s)(λ/n))ⁿ| ≤ limₙ→∞ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| = 0

Given that λₙ = n pₙ and λₙ → λ as n → ∞ because n pₙ → λ. So, λₙ - λ tends to zero as n increases. That makes sense since if n pₙ approaches λ, then λₙ = n pₙ is approaching λ, so their difference goes to zero. Therefore, |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, and multiplied by |1 - s|, which is a constant with respect to n, the right-hand side limit is zero. So, if I can show that the left-hand side is bounded by this term that goes to zero, then the squeeze theorem would imply that the left-hand side limit is also zero.

Okay, so the key is to bound |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n)ⁿ - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)ⁿ| by |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| for each n, and then take the limit. But how do I get that bound?

Maybe I can use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) for functions. If I consider the function f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)ⁿ, then the difference would be f(λₙ) - f(λ). By MVT, this is equal to f’(c)(λₙ - λ) for some c between λₙ and λ. Then, the absolute value would be |f’(c)| |λₙ - λ|. If I can show that |f’(c)| ≤ |1 - s|, then multiplying by |λₙ - λ| gives the desired bound.

Let me try that. Let’s define f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^n. Then, the derivative f’(x) is n * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1) * (- (1 - s)/n) = - (1 - s) * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1).

So, |f’(c)| = |1 - s| * (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}.

Now, I need to bound (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. Since c is between λₙ and λ, and λₙ → λ, then c ≈ λ for large n. But even more, as n → ∞, c/n ≈ λ/n, which goes to zero. So, (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is similar to (1 - o(1)/n)^n, which tends to e^{- (1 - s)c}. But wait, actually, if c/n is small, then (1 - a/n)^n ≈ e^{-a}, so here it would be approximately e^{- (1 - s)c}. However, since c is between λₙ and λ, which converges to λ, then as n → ∞, this term would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. But since we&#x27;re taking the absolute value, and exponentials are positive, this would just be e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. But how does that help me?

Wait, but in the derivative f’(c), we have (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. For finite n, how can I bound this term? Let&#x27;s see. Since (1 - (1 - s)c/n) is a term that is less than 1 in magnitude if (1 - s)c/n is positive. However, s is a variable in the generating function, typically in [0,1] for probability generating functions, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify. Wait, the generating function for a binomial distribution is (1 - p + p s)^n, which would correspond to s in [0,1] perhaps? But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify the domain of s, so maybe s is a complex variable? Hmm, the problem mentions &quot;the generating function of a sequence of binomially distributed random variables converges to the generating function of the Poisson distribution.&quot; So perhaps s is a real number in the context of probability generating functions, which are defined for |s| ≤ 1.

But maybe I can proceed without knowing exactly. Let&#x27;s suppose that s is such that |1 - (1 - s)c/n| &lt; 1 for all n sufficiently large. If (1 - s)c/n is positive and less than 1, then the term inside the absolute value is less than 1. But regardless, when raising to the power n, if the base is approaching 1 from below, then (1 - a/n)^n approaches e^{-a}. So perhaps the term (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is bounded by some constant for all n.

But maybe instead of trying to bound the derivative directly, I can use an inequality for the difference of exponentials. Wait, but these are finite n terms. Alternatively, use the inequality |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}}. Is that a valid inequality?

Yes, because for any a and b, |aⁿ - bⁿ| = |a - b| |a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1}| ≤ |a - b| n max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}.

So maybe applying this with a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n and b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n.

Then, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Compute |a - b| = |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n) - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)| = |(1 - s)(λ - λₙ)/n| = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n.

Therefore, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n * (|1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n) * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} } = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

So, the left-hand side of our original inequality is |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Now, to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity. The term |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| tends to |1 - s| * 0 = 0. But what about the max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}?

If we can show that max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} is bounded as n → ∞, then the entire expression tends to zero. Let&#x27;s check |a|^{n - 1} and |b|^{n - 1}.

First, let&#x27;s recall that λₙ = n pₙ → λ, so for large n, λₙ is close to λ.

Compute a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n. As n → ∞, (1 - s)λₙ/n ≈ (1 - s)λ/n → 0. So, a ≈ 1 - o(1)/n, so as n increases, a approaches 1. Similarly, b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n also approaches 1.

Therefore, both |a| and |b| are approximately 1 - something small. The question is, when you raise such a term to the power n - 1, does it approach a finite limit?

Yes. For example, (1 - c/n)^n → e^{-c} as n → ∞. So, |a|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λₙ} as n → ∞. Similarly, |b|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ}.

Since λₙ → λ, both exponents approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. Therefore, the max of these two terms would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. Therefore, max{|a|^{n -1}, |b|^{n -1}} is bounded as n → ∞.

Therefore, the entire expression |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * C for some constant C. Since |λₙ - λ| → 0, the product tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the left-hand side is bounded above by zero (since the right-hand side limit is zero), and because absolute values are non-negative, the limit must be zero. Hence, the original inequality holds, and the limit is zero.

Alternatively, since the max term converges to e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a constant, and |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, then the product goes to zero. Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the left-hand side limit is zero.

Therefore, the generating functions converge because the difference between them goes to zero, which implies that the binomial distribution&#x27;s generating function converges to the Poisson generating function, which is e^{λ(s - 1)}. Because (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)^n ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ} as n → ∞. Wait, actually, let me check that.

Wait, the generating function of a binomial distribution with parameters n and p is (1 - p + p s)^n = (1 + p(s - 1))^n. If we let p = λₙ /n, then it&#x27;s (1 + (λₙ /n)(s - 1))^n. As n → ∞, this tends to e^{λ(s - 1)}, which is the generating function of Poisson(λ). So, indeed, the convergence of the generating functions implies convergence in distribution, hence in probability as well.

But the problem mentions this is an application of the convergence theorem in probability, demonstrating that the generating function converges. So, the key step is showing that the difference between the generating functions goes to zero, which we did by bounding it with |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| times a bounded term, hence the limit is zero.

Therefore, the original inequality is proven, and the limit is zero.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

To show that the limit of the absolute difference between the two expressions is bounded by zero, we start by considering the function \( f(x) = \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^n \). We use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) to bound the difference \( |f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda)| \).

By MVT, there exists some \( c \) between \( \lambda_n \) and \( \lambda \) such that:
\[
f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda) = f&#x27;(c)(\lambda_n - \lambda)
\]
The derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) is calculated as:
\[
f&#x27;(x) = - (1 - s) \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n-1}
\]
Taking the absolute value, we get:
\[
|f&#x27;(c)| = |1 - s| \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right|^{n-1}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), \( \lambda_n \to \lambda \), so \( c \approx \lambda \). The term \( \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right)^{n-1} \) approximates \( e^{-(1 - s)c} \), which is bounded. 

Using the inequality for the difference of powers, we have:
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq n |a - b| \max\{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}\}
\]
where \( a = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n} \) and \( b = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n} \). The difference \( |a - b| \) is:
\[
|a - b| = \left| (1 - s) \frac{\lambda - \lambda_n}{n} \right| = \frac{|1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda|}{n}
\]
Thus,
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \max\left\{\left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n}\right|^{n-1}, \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n}\right|^{n-1}\right\}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), the max term converges to \( e^{-(1 - s)\lambda} \), a constant. Since \( |\lambda_n - \lambda| \to 0 \), the product \( |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \cdot C \) tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the absolute difference is bounded by zero, proving the result:

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s see. I need to show that the limit of the absolute difference between two expressions is less than or equal to the limit of |1 - s| |λₙ - λ|, which is zero. And this is related to the convergence of generating functions from binomial to Poisson distributions. Hmm, okay.

First, let me parse the problem. The main inequality to show is:

limₙ→∞ |(1 - (1 - s)(λₙ/n))ⁿ - (1 - (1 - s)(λ/n))ⁿ| ≤ limₙ→∞ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| = 0

Given that λₙ = n pₙ and λₙ → λ as n → ∞ because n pₙ → λ. So, λₙ - λ tends to zero as n increases. That makes sense since if n pₙ approaches λ, then λₙ = n pₙ is approaching λ, so their difference goes to zero. Therefore, |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, and multiplied by |1 - s|, which is a constant with respect to n, the right-hand side limit is zero. So, if I can show that the left-hand side is bounded by this term that goes to zero, then the squeeze theorem would imply that the left-hand side limit is also zero.

Okay, so the key is to bound |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n)ⁿ - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)ⁿ| by |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| for each n, and then take the limit. But how do I get that bound?

Maybe I can use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) for functions. If I consider the function f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)ⁿ, then the difference would be f(λₙ) - f(λ). By MVT, this is equal to f’(c)(λₙ - λ) for some c between λₙ and λ. Then, the absolute value would be |f’(c)| |λₙ - λ|. If I can show that |f’(c)| ≤ |1 - s|, then multiplying by |λₙ - λ| gives the desired bound.

Let me try that. Let’s define f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^n. Then, the derivative f’(x) is n * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1) * (- (1 - s)/n) = - (1 - s) * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1).

So, |f’(c)| = |1 - s| * (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}.

Now, I need to bound (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. Since c is between λₙ and λ, and λₙ → λ, then c ≈ λ for large n. But even more, as n → ∞, c/n ≈ λ/n, which goes to zero. So, (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is similar to (1 - o(1)/n)^n, which tends to e^{- (1 - s)c}. But wait, actually, if c/n is small, then (1 - a/n)^n ≈ e^{-a}, so here it would be approximately e^{- (1 - s)c}. However, since c is between λₙ and λ, which converges to λ, then as n → ∞, this term would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. But since we&#x27;re taking the absolute value, and exponentials are positive, this would just be e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. But how does that help me?

Wait, but in the derivative f’(c), we have (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. For finite n, how can I bound this term? Let&#x27;s see. Since (1 - (1 - s)c/n) is a term that is less than 1 in magnitude if (1 - s)c/n is positive. However, s is a variable in the generating function, typically in [0,1] for probability generating functions, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify. Wait, the generating function for a binomial distribution is (1 - p + p s)^n, which would correspond to s in [0,1] perhaps? But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify the domain of s, so maybe s is a complex variable? Hmm, the problem mentions &quot;the generating function of a sequence of binomially distributed random variables converges to the generating function of the Poisson distribution.&quot; So perhaps s is a real number in the context of probability generating functions, which are defined for |s| ≤ 1.

But maybe I can proceed without knowing exactly. Let&#x27;s suppose that s is such that |1 - (1 - s)c/n| &lt; 1 for all n sufficiently large. If (1 - s)c/n is positive and less than 1, then the term inside the absolute value is less than 1. But regardless, when raising to the power n, if the base is approaching 1 from below, then (1 - a/n)^n approaches e^{-a}. So perhaps the term (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is bounded by some constant for all n.

But maybe instead of trying to bound the derivative directly, I can use an inequality for the difference of exponentials. Wait, but these are finite n terms. Alternatively, use the inequality |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}}. Is that a valid inequality?

Yes, because for any a and b, |aⁿ - bⁿ| = |a - b| |a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1}| ≤ |a - b| n max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}.

So maybe applying this with a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n and b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n.

Then, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Compute |a - b| = |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n) - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)| = |(1 - s)(λ - λₙ)/n| = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n.

Therefore, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n * (|1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n) * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} } = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

So, the left-hand side of our original inequality is |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Now, to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity. The term |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| tends to |1 - s| * 0 = 0. But what about the max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}?

If we can show that max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} is bounded as n → ∞, then the entire expression tends to zero. Let&#x27;s check |a|^{n - 1} and |b|^{n - 1}.

First, let&#x27;s recall that λₙ = n pₙ → λ, so for large n, λₙ is close to λ.

Compute a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n. As n → ∞, (1 - s)λₙ/n ≈ (1 - s)λ/n → 0. So, a ≈ 1 - o(1)/n, so as n increases, a approaches 1. Similarly, b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n also approaches 1.

Therefore, both |a| and |b| are approximately 1 - something small. The question is, when you raise such a term to the power n - 1, does it approach a finite limit?

Yes. For example, (1 - c/n)^n → e^{-c} as n → ∞. So, |a|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λₙ} as n → ∞. Similarly, |b|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ}.

Since λₙ → λ, both exponents approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. Therefore, the max of these two terms would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. Therefore, max{|a|^{n -1}, |b|^{n -1}} is bounded as n → ∞.

Therefore, the entire expression |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * C for some constant C. Since |λₙ - λ| → 0, the product tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the left-hand side is bounded above by zero (since the right-hand side limit is zero), and because absolute values are non-negative, the limit must be zero. Hence, the original inequality holds, and the limit is zero.

Alternatively, since the max term converges to e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a constant, and |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, then the product goes to zero. Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the left-hand side limit is zero.

Therefore, the generating functions converge because the difference between them goes to zero, which implies that the binomial distribution&#x27;s generating function converges to the Poisson generating function, which is e^{λ(s - 1)}. Because (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)^n ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ} as n → ∞. Wait, actually, let me check that.

Wait, the generating function of a binomial distribution with parameters n and p is (1 - p + p s)^n = (1 + p(s - 1))^n. If we let p = λₙ /n, then it&#x27;s (1 + (λₙ /n)(s - 1))^n. As n → ∞, this tends to e^{λ(s - 1)}, which is the generating function of Poisson(λ). So, indeed, the convergence of the generating functions implies convergence in distribution, hence in probability as well.

But the problem mentions this is an application of the convergence theorem in probability, demonstrating that the generating function converges. So, the key step is showing that the difference between the generating functions goes to zero, which we did by bounding it with |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| times a bounded term, hence the limit is zero.

To show that the limit of the absolute difference between the two expressions is bounded by zero, we start by considering the function \( f(x) = \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^n \). We use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) to bound the difference \( |f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda)| \).

By MVT, there exists some \( c \) between \( \lambda_n \) and \( \lambda \) such that:
\[
f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda) = f&#x27;(c)(\lambda_n - \lambda)
\]
The derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) is calculated as:
\[
f&#x27;(x) = - (1 - s) \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n-1}
\]
Taking the absolute value, we get:
\[
|f&#x27;(c)| = |1 - s| \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right|^{n-1}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), \( \lambda_n \to \lambda \), so \( c \approx \lambda \). The term \( \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right)^{n-1} \) approximates \( e^{-(1 - s)c} \), which is bounded. 

Using the inequality for the difference of powers, we have:
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq n |a - b| \max\{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}\}
\]
where \( a = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n} \) and \( b = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n} \). The difference \( |a - b| \) is:
\[
|a - b| = \left| (1 - s) \frac{\lambda - \lambda_n}{n} \right| = \frac{|1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda|}{n}
\]
Thus,
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \max\left\{\left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n}\right|^{n-1}, \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n}\right|^{n-1}\right\}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), the max term converges to \( e^{-(1 - s)\lambda} \), a constant. Since \( |\lambda_n - \lambda| \to 0 \), the product \( |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \cdot C \) tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the absolute difference is bounded by zero, proving the result:

By MVT, this is equal to f’(c)(λₙ - λ) for some c between λₙ and λ. Then, the absolute value would be |f’(c)| |λₙ - λ|. If I can show that |f’(c)| ≤ |1 - s|, then multiplying by |λₙ - λ| gives the desired bound.

Let me try that. Let’s define f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^n. Then, the derivative f’(x) is n * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1) * (- (1 - s)/n) = - (1 - s) * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1).

So, |f’(c)| = |1 - s| * (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}.

Now, I need to bound (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. Since c is between λₙ and λ, and λₙ → λ, then c ≈ λ for large n. But even more, as n → ∞, c/n ≈ λ/n, which goes to zero. So, (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is similar to (1 - o(1)/n)^n, which tends to e^{- (1 - s)c}. But wait, actually, if c/n is small, then (1 - a/n)^n ≈ e^{-a}, so here it would be approximately e^{- (1 - s)c}. However, since c is between λₙ and λ, which converges to λ, then as n → ∞, this term would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. But since we&#x27;re taking the absolute value, and exponentials are positive, this would just be e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. But how does that help me?

Wait, but in the derivative f’(c), we have (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. For finite n, how can I bound this term? Let&#x27;s see. Since (1 - (1 - s)c/n) is a term that is less than 1 in magnitude if (1 - s)c/n is positive. However, s is a variable in the generating function, typically in [0,1] for probability generating functions, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify.

Yes, because for any a and b, |aⁿ - bⁿ| = |a - b| |a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1}| ≤ |a - b| n max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}.

So maybe applying this with a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n and b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n.

Then, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Compute |a - b| = |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n) - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)| = |(1 - s)(λ - λₙ)/n| = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n.

Therefore, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n * (|1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n) * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} } = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

So, the left-hand side of our original inequality is |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Now, to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity. The term |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| tends to |1 - s| * 0 = 0. But what about the max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}?

If we can show that max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} is bounded as n → ∞, then the entire expression tends to zero. Let&#x27;s check |a|^{n - 1} and |b|^{n - 1}.

First, let&#x27;s recall that λₙ = n pₙ → λ, so for large n, λₙ is close to λ.

Compute a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n. As n → ∞, (1 - s)λₙ/n ≈ (1 - s)λ/n → 0. So, a ≈ 1 - o(1)/n, so as n increases, a approaches 1. Similarly, b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n also approaches 1.

Therefore, both |a| and |b| are approximately 1 - something small. The question is, when you raise such a term to the power n - 1, does it approach a finite limit?

Yes. For example, (1 - c/n)^n → e^{-c} as n → ∞. So, |a|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λₙ} as n → ∞. Similarly, |b|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ}.

Since λₙ → λ, both exponents approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. Therefore, the max of these two terms would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. Therefore, max{|a|^{n -1}, |b|^{n -1}} is bounded as n → ∞.

Therefore, the entire expression |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * C for some constant C. Since |λₙ - λ| → 0, the product tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the left-hand side is bounded above by zero (since the right-hand side limit is zero), and because absolute values are non-negative, the limit must be zero. Hence, the original inequality holds, and the limit is zero.

Alternatively, since the max term converges to e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a constant, and |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, then the product goes to zero. Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the left-hand side limit is zero.

Therefore, the generating functions converge because the difference between them goes to zero, which implies that the binomial distribution&#x27;s generating function converges to the Poisson generating function, which is e^{λ(s - 1)}. Because (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)^n ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ} as n → ∞. Wait, actually, let me check that.

Wait, the generating function of a binomial distribution with parameters n and p is (1 - p + p s)^n = (1 + p(s - 1))^n. If we let p = λₙ /n, then it&#x27;s (1 + (λₙ /n)(s - 1))^n. As n → ∞, this tends to e^{λ(s - 1)}, which is the generating function of Poisson(λ). So, indeed, the convergence of the generating functions implies convergence in distribution, hence in probability as well.

But the problem mentions this is an application of the convergence theorem in probability, demonstrating that the generating function converges. So, the key step is showing that the difference between the generating functions goes to zero, which we did by bounding it with |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| times a bounded term, hence the limit is zero.

Therefore, the original inequality is proven, and the limit is zero.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

To show that the limit of the absolute difference between the two expressions is bounded by zero, we start by considering the function \( f(x) = \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^n \). We use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) to bound the difference \( |f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda)| \).

By MVT, there exists some \( c \) between \( \lambda_n \) and \( \lambda \) such that:
\[
f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda) = f&#x27;(c)(\lambda_n - \lambda)
\]
The derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) is calculated as:
\[
f&#x27;(x) = - (1 - s) \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n-1}
\]
Taking the absolute value, we get:
\[
|f&#x27;(c)| = |1 - s| \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right|^{n-1}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), \( \lambda_n \to \lambda \), so \( c \approx \lambda \). The term \( \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right)^{n-1} \) approximates \( e^{-(1 - s)c} \), which is bounded. 

Using the inequality for the difference of powers, we have:
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq n |a - b| \max\{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}\}
\]
where \( a = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n} \) and \( b = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n} \). The difference \( |a - b| \) is:
\[
|a - b| = \left| (1 - s) \frac{\lambda - \lambda_n}{n} \right| = \frac{|1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda|}{n}
\]
Thus,
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \max\left\{\left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n}\right|^{n-1}, \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n}\right|^{n-1}\right\}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), the max term converges to \( e^{-(1 - s)\lambda} \), a constant. Since \( |\lambda_n - \lambda| \to 0 \), the product \( |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \cdot C \) tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the absolute difference is bounded by zero, proving the result:

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s see. I need to show that the limit of the absolute difference between two expressions is less than or equal to the limit of |1 - s| |λₙ - λ|, which is zero. And this is related to the convergence of generating functions from binomial to Poisson distributions. Hmm, okay.

First, let me parse the problem. The main inequality to show is:

limₙ→∞ |(1 - (1 - s)(λₙ/n))ⁿ - (1 - (1 - s)(λ/n))ⁿ| ≤ limₙ→∞ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| = 0

Given that λₙ = n pₙ and λₙ → λ as n → ∞ because n pₙ → λ. So, λₙ - λ tends to zero as n increases. That makes sense since if n pₙ approaches λ, then λₙ = n pₙ is approaching λ, so their difference goes to zero. Therefore, |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, and multiplied by |1 - s|, which is a constant with respect to n, the right-hand side limit is zero. So, if I can show that the left-hand side is bounded by this term that goes to zero, then the squeeze theorem would imply that the left-hand side limit is also zero.

Okay, so the key is to bound |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n)ⁿ - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)ⁿ| by |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| for each n, and then take the limit. But how do I get that bound?

Maybe I can use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) for functions. If I consider the function f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)ⁿ, then the difference would be f(λₙ) - f(λ). By MVT, this is equal to f’(c)(λₙ - λ) for some c between λₙ and λ. Then, the absolute value would be |f’(c)| |λₙ - λ|. If I can show that |f’(c)| ≤ |1 - s|, then multiplying by |λₙ - λ| gives the desired bound.

Let me try that. Let’s define f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^n. Then, the derivative f’(x) is n * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1) * (- (1 - s)/n) = - (1 - s) * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1).

So, |f’(c)| = |1 - s| * (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}.

Now, I need to bound (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. Since c is between λₙ and λ, and λₙ → λ, then c ≈ λ for large n. But even more, as n → ∞, c/n ≈ λ/n, which goes to zero. So, (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is similar to (1 - o(1)/n)^n, which tends to e^{- (1 - s)c}. But wait, actually, if c/n is small, then (1 - a/n)^n ≈ e^{-a}, so here it would be approximately e^{- (1 - s)c}. However, since c is between λₙ and λ, which converges to λ, then as n → ∞, this term would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. But since we&#x27;re taking the absolute value, and exponentials are positive, this would just be e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. But how does that help me?

Wait, but in the derivative f’(c), we have (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. For finite n, how can I bound this term? Let&#x27;s see. Since (1 - (1 - s)c/n) is a term that is less than 1 in magnitude if (1 - s)c/n is positive. However, s is a variable in the generating function, typically in [0,1] for probability generating functions, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify. Wait, the generating function for a binomial distribution is (1 - p + p s)^n, which would correspond to s in [0,1] perhaps? But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify the domain of s, so maybe s is a complex variable? Hmm, the problem mentions &quot;the generating function of a sequence of binomially distributed random variables converges to the generating function of the Poisson distribution.&quot; So perhaps s is a real number in the context of probability generating functions, which are defined for |s| ≤ 1.

But maybe I can proceed without knowing exactly. Let&#x27;s suppose that s is such that |1 - (1 - s)c/n| &lt; 1 for all n sufficiently large. If (1 - s)c/n is positive and less than 1, then the term inside the absolute value is less than 1. But regardless, when raising to the power n, if the base is approaching 1 from below, then (1 - a/n)^n approaches e^{-a}. So perhaps the term (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is bounded by some constant for all n.

But maybe instead of trying to bound the derivative directly, I can use an inequality for the difference of exponentials. Wait, but these are finite n terms. Alternatively, use the inequality |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}}. Is that a valid inequality?

Yes, because for any a and b, |aⁿ - bⁿ| = |a - b| |a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1}| ≤ |a - b| n max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}.

So maybe applying this with a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n and b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n.

Then, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Compute |a - b| = |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n) - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)| = |(1 - s)(λ - λₙ)/n| = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n.

Therefore, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n * (|1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n) * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} } = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

So, the left-hand side of our original inequality is |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Now, to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity. The term |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| tends to |1 - s| * 0 = 0. But what about the max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}?

If we can show that max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} is bounded as n → ∞, then the entire expression tends to zero. Let&#x27;s check |a|^{n - 1} and |b|^{n - 1}.

First, let&#x27;s recall that λₙ = n pₙ → λ, so for large n, λₙ is close to λ.

Compute a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n. As n → ∞, (1 - s)λₙ/n ≈ (1 - s)λ/n → 0. So, a ≈ 1 - o(1)/n, so as n increases, a approaches 1. Similarly, b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n also approaches 1.

Therefore, both |a| and |b| are approximately 1 - something small. The question is, when you raise such a term to the power n - 1, does it approach a finite limit?

Yes. For example, (1 - c/n)^n → e^{-c} as n → ∞. So, |a|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λₙ} as n → ∞. Similarly, |b|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ}.

Since λₙ → λ, both exponents approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. Therefore, the max of these two terms would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. Therefore, max{|a|^{n -1}, |b|^{n -1}} is bounded as n → ∞.

Therefore, the entire expression |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * C for some constant C. Since |λₙ - λ| → 0, the product tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the left-hand side is bounded above by zero (since the right-hand side limit is zero), and because absolute values are non-negative, the limit must be zero. Hence, the original inequality holds, and the limit is zero.

Alternatively, since the max term converges to e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a constant, and |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, then the product goes to zero. Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the left-hand side limit is zero.

Therefore, the generating functions converge because the difference between them goes to zero, which implies that the binomial distribution&#x27;s generating function converges to the Poisson generating function, which is e^{λ(s - 1)}. Because (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)^n ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ} as n → ∞. Wait, actually, let me check that.

Wait, the generating function of a binomial distribution with parameters n and p is (1 - p + p s)^n = (1 + p(s - 1))^n. If we let p = λₙ /n, then it&#x27;s (1 + (λₙ /n)(s - 1))^n. As n → ∞, this tends to e^{λ(s - 1)}, which is the generating function of Poisson(λ). So, indeed, the convergence of the generating functions implies convergence in distribution, hence in probability as well.

But the problem mentions this is an application of the convergence theorem in probability, demonstrating that the generating function converges.

To show that the limit of the absolute difference between the two expressions is bounded by zero, we start by considering the function \( f(x) = \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^n \). We use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) to bound the difference \( |f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda)| \).

By MVT, there exists some \( c \) between \( \lambda_n \) and \( \lambda \) such that:
\[
f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda) = f&#x27;(c)(\lambda_n - \lambda)
\]
The derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) is calculated as:
\[
f&#x27;(x) = - (1 - s) \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n-1}
\]
Taking the absolute value, we get:
\[
|f&#x27;(c)| = |1 - s| \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right|^{n-1}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), \( \lambda_n \to \lambda \), so \( c \approx \lambda \). The term \( \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right)^{n-1} \) approximates \( e^{-(1 - s)c} \), which is bounded. 

Using the inequality for the difference of powers, we have:
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq n |a - b| \max\{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}\}
\]
where \( a = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n} \) and \( b = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n} \). The difference \( |a - b| \) is:
\[
|a - b| = \left| (1 - s) \frac{\lambda - \lambda_n}{n} \right| = \frac{|1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda|}{n}
\]
Thus,
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \max\left\{\left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n}\right|^{n-1}, \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n}\right|^{n-1}\right\}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), the max term converges to \( e^{-(1 - s)\lambda} \), a constant. Since \( |\lambda_n - \lambda| \to 0 \), the product \( |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \cdot C \) tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the absolute difference is bounded by zero, proving the result:

Maybe I can use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) for functions. If I consider the function f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)ⁿ, then the difference would be f(λₙ) - f(λ). By MVT, this is equal to f’(c)(λₙ - λ) for some c between λₙ and λ. Then, the absolute value would be |f’(c)| |λₙ - λ|. If I can show that |f’(c)| ≤ |1 - s|, then multiplying by |λₙ - λ| gives the desired bound.

Let me try that. Let’s define f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^n. Then, the derivative f’(x) is n * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1) * (- (1 - s)/n) = - (1 - s) * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1).

So, |f’(c)| = |1 - s| * (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}.

Now, I need to bound (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. Since c is between λₙ and λ, and λₙ → λ, then c ≈ λ for large n. But even more, as n → ∞, c/n ≈ λ/n, which goes to zero. So, (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is similar to (1 - o(1)/n)^n, which tends to e^{- (1 - s)c}. But wait, actually, if c/n is small, then (1 - a/n)^n ≈ e^{-a}, so here it would be approximately e^{- (1 - s)c}. However, since c is between λₙ and λ, which converges to λ, then as n → ∞, this term would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. But since we&#x27;re taking the absolute value, and exponentials are positive, this would just be e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. But how does that help me?

Wait, but in the derivative f’(c), we have (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. For finite n, how can I bound this term? Let&#x27;s see. Since (1 - (1 - s)c/n) is a term that is less than 1 in magnitude if (1 - s)c/n is positive.

Yes, because for any a and b, |aⁿ - bⁿ| = |a - b| |a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1}| ≤ |a - b| n max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}.

So maybe applying this with a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n and b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n.

Then, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Compute |a - b| = |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n) - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)| = |(1 - s)(λ - λₙ)/n| = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n.

Therefore, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n * (|1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n) * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} } = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

So, the left-hand side of our original inequality is |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Now, to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity. The term |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| tends to |1 - s| * 0 = 0. But what about the max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}?

If we can show that max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} is bounded as n → ∞, then the entire expression tends to zero. Let&#x27;s check |a|^{n - 1} and |b|^{n - 1}.

First, let&#x27;s recall that λₙ = n pₙ → λ, so for large n, λₙ is close to λ.

Compute a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n. As n → ∞, (1 - s)λₙ/n ≈ (1 - s)λ/n → 0. So, a ≈ 1 - o(1)/n, so as n increases, a approaches 1. Similarly, b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n also approaches 1.

Therefore, both |a| and |b| are approximately 1 - something small. The question is, when you raise such a term to the power n - 1, does it approach a finite limit?

Yes. For example, (1 - c/n)^n → e^{-c} as n → ∞. So, |a|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λₙ} as n → ∞. Similarly, |b|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ}.

Since λₙ → λ, both exponents approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. Therefore, the max of these two terms would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. Therefore, max{|a|^{n -1}, |b|^{n -1}} is bounded as n → ∞.

Therefore, the entire expression |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * C for some constant C. Since |λₙ - λ| → 0, the product tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the left-hand side is bounded above by zero (since the right-hand side limit is zero), and because absolute values are non-negative, the limit must be zero. Hence, the original inequality holds, and the limit is zero.

Alternatively, since the max term converges to e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a constant, and |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, then the product goes to zero. Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the left-hand side limit is zero.

Therefore, the generating functions converge because the difference between them goes to zero, which implies that the binomial distribution&#x27;s generating function converges to the Poisson generating function, which is e^{λ(s - 1)}. Because (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)^n ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ} as n → ∞. Wait, actually, let me check that.

Wait, the generating function of a binomial distribution with parameters n and p is (1 - p + p s)^n = (1 + p(s - 1))^n. If we let p = λₙ /n, then it&#x27;s (1 + (λₙ /n)(s - 1))^n. As n → ∞, this tends to e^{λ(s - 1)}, which is the generating function of Poisson(λ). So, indeed, the convergence of the generating functions implies convergence in distribution, hence in probability as well.

But the problem mentions this is an application of the convergence theorem in probability, demonstrating that the generating function converges. So, the key step is showing that the difference between the generating functions goes to zero, which we did by bounding it with |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| times a bounded term, hence the limit is zero.

Therefore, the original inequality is proven, and the limit is zero.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

To show that the limit of the absolute difference between the two expressions is bounded by zero, we start by considering the function \( f(x) = \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^n \). We use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) to bound the difference \( |f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda)| \).

By MVT, there exists some \( c \) between \( \lambda_n \) and \( \lambda \) such that:
\[
f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda) = f&#x27;(c)(\lambda_n - \lambda)
\]
The derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) is calculated as:
\[
f&#x27;(x) = - (1 - s) \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n-1}
\]
Taking the absolute value, we get:
\[
|f&#x27;(c)| = |1 - s| \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right|^{n-1}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), \( \lambda_n \to \lambda \), so \( c \approx \lambda \). The term \( \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right)^{n-1} \) approximates \( e^{-(1 - s)c} \), which is bounded. 

Using the inequality for the difference of powers, we have:
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq n |a - b| \max\{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}\}
\]
where \( a = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n} \) and \( b = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n} \). The difference \( |a - b| \) is:
\[
|a - b| = \left| (1 - s) \frac{\lambda - \lambda_n}{n} \right| = \frac{|1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda|}{n}
\]
Thus,
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \max\left\{\left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n}\right|^{n-1}, \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n}\right|^{n-1}\right\}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), the max term converges to \( e^{-(1 - s)\lambda} \), a constant. Since \( |\lambda_n - \lambda| \to 0 \), the product \( |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \cdot C \) tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the absolute difference is bounded by zero, proving the result:

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s see. I need to show that the limit of the absolute difference between two expressions is less than or equal to the limit of |1 - s| |λₙ - λ|, which is zero. And this is related to the convergence of generating functions from binomial to Poisson distributions. Hmm, okay.

First, let me parse the problem. The main inequality to show is:

limₙ→∞ |(1 - (1 - s)(λₙ/n))ⁿ - (1 - (1 - s)(λ/n))ⁿ| ≤ limₙ→∞ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| = 0

Given that λₙ = n pₙ and λₙ → λ as n → ∞ because n pₙ → λ. So, λₙ - λ tends to zero as n increases. That makes sense since if n pₙ approaches λ, then λₙ = n pₙ is approaching λ, so their difference goes to zero. Therefore, |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, and multiplied by |1 - s|, which is a constant with respect to n, the right-hand side limit is zero. So, if I can show that the left-hand side is bounded by this term that goes to zero, then the squeeze theorem would imply that the left-hand side limit is also zero.

Okay, so the key is to bound |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n)ⁿ - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)ⁿ| by |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| for each n, and then take the limit. But how do I get that bound?

Maybe I can use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) for functions. If I consider the function f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)ⁿ, then the difference would be f(λₙ) - f(λ). By MVT, this is equal to f’(c)(λₙ - λ) for some c between λₙ and λ. Then, the absolute value would be |f’(c)| |λₙ - λ|. If I can show that |f’(c)| ≤ |1 - s|, then multiplying by |λₙ - λ| gives the desired bound.

Let me try that. Let’s define f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^n. Then, the derivative f’(x) is n * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1) * (- (1 - s)/n) = - (1 - s) * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1).

So, |f’(c)| = |1 - s| * (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}.

Now, I need to bound (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. Since c is between λₙ and λ, and λₙ → λ, then c ≈ λ for large n. But even more, as n → ∞, c/n ≈ λ/n, which goes to zero. So, (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is similar to (1 - o(1)/n)^n, which tends to e^{- (1 - s)c}. But wait, actually, if c/n is small, then (1 - a/n)^n ≈ e^{-a}, so here it would be approximately e^{- (1 - s)c}. However, since c is between λₙ and λ, which converges to λ, then as n → ∞, this term would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. But since we&#x27;re taking the absolute value, and exponentials are positive, this would just be e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. But how does that help me?

Wait, but in the derivative f’(c), we have (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. For finite n, how can I bound this term? Let&#x27;s see. Since (1 - (1 - s)c/n) is a term that is less than 1 in magnitude if (1 - s)c/n is positive. However, s is a variable in the generating function, typically in [0,1] for probability generating functions, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify. Wait, the generating function for a binomial distribution is (1 - p + p s)^n, which would correspond to s in [0,1] perhaps? But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify the domain of s, so maybe s is a complex variable? Hmm, the problem mentions &quot;the generating function of a sequence of binomially distributed random variables converges to the generating function of the Poisson distribution.&quot; So perhaps s is a real number in the context of probability generating functions, which are defined for |s| ≤ 1.

But maybe I can proceed without knowing exactly. Let&#x27;s suppose that s is such that |1 - (1 - s)c/n| &lt; 1 for all n sufficiently large. If (1 - s)c/n is positive and less than 1, then the term inside the absolute value is less than 1. But regardless, when raising to the power n, if the base is approaching 1 from below, then (1 - a/n)^n approaches e^{-a}. So perhaps the term (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is bounded by some constant for all n.

But maybe instead of trying to bound the derivative directly, I can use an inequality for the difference of exponentials. Wait, but these are finite n terms. Alternatively, use the inequality |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}}. Is that a valid inequality?

Yes, because for any a and b, |aⁿ - bⁿ| = |a - b| |a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1}| ≤ |a - b| n max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}.

So maybe applying this with a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n and b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n.

Then, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Compute |a - b| = |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n) - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)| = |(1 - s)(λ - λₙ)/n| = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n.

Therefore, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n * (|1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n) * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} } = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

So, the left-hand side of our original inequality is |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Now, to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity. The term |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| tends to |1 - s| * 0 = 0. But what about the max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}?

If we can show that max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} is bounded as n → ∞, then the entire expression tends to zero. Let&#x27;s check |a|^{n - 1} and |b|^{n - 1}.

First, let&#x27;s recall that λₙ = n pₙ → λ, so for large n, λₙ is close to λ.

Compute a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n. As n → ∞, (1 - s)λₙ/n ≈ (1 - s)λ/n → 0. So, a ≈ 1 - o(1)/n, so as n increases, a approaches 1. Similarly, b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n also approaches 1.

Therefore, both |a| and |b| are approximately 1 - something small. The question is, when you raise such a term to the power n - 1, does it approach a finite limit?

Yes. For example, (1 - c/n)^n → e^{-c} as n → ∞. So, |a|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λₙ} as n → ∞. Similarly, |b|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ}.

Since λₙ → λ, both exponents approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. Therefore, the max of these two terms would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. Therefore, max{|a|^{n -1}, |b|^{n -1}} is bounded as n → ∞.

Therefore, the entire expression |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * C for some constant C. Since |λₙ - λ| → 0, the product tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the left-hand side is bounded above by zero (since the right-hand side limit is zero), and because absolute values are non-negative, the limit must be zero. Hence, the original inequality holds, and the limit is zero.

Alternatively, since the max term converges to e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a constant, and |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, then the product goes to zero. Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the left-hand side limit is zero.

Therefore, the generating functions converge because the difference between them goes to zero, which implies that the binomial distribution&#x27;s generating function converges to the Poisson generating function, which is e^{λ(s - 1)}. Because (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)^n ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ} as n → ∞. Wait, actually, let me check that.

Wait, the generating function of a binomial distribution with parameters n and p is (1 - p + p s)^n = (1 + p(s - 1))^n. If we let p = λₙ /n, then it&#x27;s (1 + (λₙ /n)(s - 1))^n. As n → ∞, this tends to e^{λ(s - 1)}, which is the generating function of Poisson(λ). So, indeed, the convergence of the generating functions implies convergence in distribution, hence in probability as well.

But the problem mentions this is an application of the convergence theorem in probability, demonstrating that the generating function converges. So, the key step is showing that the difference between the generating functions goes to zero, which we did by bounding it with |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| times a bounded term, hence the limit is zero.

Therefore, the original inequality is proven, and the limit is zero.

&lt;/think&gt;

To show that the limit of the absolute difference between the two expressions is bounded by zero, we start by considering the function \( f(x) = \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^n \). We use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) to bound the difference \( |f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda)| \).

By MVT, there exists some \( c \) between \( \lambda_n \) and \( \lambda \) such that:
\[
f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda) = f&#x27;(c)(\lambda_n - \lambda)
\]
The derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) is calculated as:
\[
f&#x27;(x) = - (1 - s) \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n-1}
\]
Taking the absolute value, we get:
\[
|f&#x27;(c)| = |1 - s| \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right|^{n-1}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), \( \lambda_n \to \lambda \), so \( c \approx \lambda \). The term \( \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right)^{n-1} \) approximates \( e^{-(1 - s)c} \), which is bounded. 

Using the inequality for the difference of powers, we have:
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq n |a - b| \max\{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}\}
\]
where \( a = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n} \) and \( b = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n} \). The difference \( |a - b| \) is:
\[
|a - b| = \left| (1 - s) \frac{\lambda - \lambda_n}{n} \right| = \frac{|1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda|}{n}
\]
Thus,
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \max\left\{\left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n}\right|^{n-1}, \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n}\right|^{n-1}\right\}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), the max term converges to \( e^{-(1 - s)\lambda} \), a constant. Since \( |\lambda_n - \lambda| \to 0 \), the product \( |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \cdot C \) tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the absolute difference is bounded by zero, proving the result:

By MVT, this is equal to f’(c)(λₙ - λ) for some c between λₙ and λ. Then, the absolute value would be |f’(c)| |λₙ - λ|. If I can show that |f’(c)| ≤ |1 - s|, then multiplying by |λₙ - λ| gives the desired bound.

Let me try that. Let’s define f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^n. Then, the derivative f’(x) is n * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1) * (- (1 - s)/n) = - (1 - s) * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1).

So, |f’(c)| = |1 - s| * (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}.

Now, I need to bound (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. Since c is between λₙ and λ, and λₙ → λ, then c ≈ λ for large n. But even more, as n → ∞, c/n ≈ λ/n, which goes to zero. So, (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is similar to (1 - o(1)/n)^n, which tends to e^{- (1 - s)c}. But wait, actually, if c/n is small, then (1 - a/n)^n ≈ e^{-a}, so here it would be approximately e^{- (1 - s)c}. However, since c is between λₙ and λ, which converges to λ, then as n → ∞, this term would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. But since we&#x27;re taking the absolute value, and exponentials are positive, this would just be e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. But how does that help me?

Wait, but in the derivative f’(c), we have (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. For finite n, how can I bound this term? Let&#x27;s see. Since (1 - (1 - s)c/n) is a term that is less than 1 in magnitude if (1 - s)c/n is positive. However, s is a variable in the generating function, typically in [0,1] for probability generating functions, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify.

So perhaps the term (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is bounded by some constant for all n.

But maybe instead of trying to bound the derivative directly, I can use an inequality for the difference of exponentials. Wait, but these are finite n terms. Alternatively, use the inequality |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}}. Is that a valid inequality?

Yes, because for any a and b, |aⁿ - bⁿ| = |a - b| |a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1}| ≤ |a - b| n max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}.

So maybe applying this with a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n and b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n.

Then, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Compute |a - b| = |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n) - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)| = |(1 - s)(λ - λₙ)/n| = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n.

Therefore, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n * (|1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n) * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} } = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

So, the left-hand side of our original inequality is |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Now, to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity. The term |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| tends to |1 - s| * 0 = 0. But what about the max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}?

If we can show that max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} is bounded as n → ∞, then the entire expression tends to zero. Let&#x27;s check |a|^{n - 1} and |b|^{n - 1}.

First, let&#x27;s recall that λₙ = n pₙ → λ, so for large n, λₙ is close to λ.

Compute a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n. As n → ∞, (1 - s)λₙ/n ≈ (1 - s)λ/n → 0. So, a ≈ 1 - o(1)/n, so as n increases, a approaches 1. Similarly, b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n also approaches 1.

Therefore, both |a| and |b| are approximately 1 - something small. The question is, when you raise such a term to the power n - 1, does it approach a finite limit?

Yes. For example, (1 - c/n)^n → e^{-c} as n → ∞. So, |a|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λₙ} as n → ∞. Similarly, |b|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ}.

Since λₙ → λ, both exponents approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. Therefore, the max of these two terms would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. Therefore, max{|a|^{n -1}, |b|^{n -1}} is bounded as n → ∞.

Therefore, the entire expression |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * C for some constant C. Since |λₙ - λ| → 0, the product tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the left-hand side is bounded above by zero (since the right-hand side limit is zero), and because absolute values are non-negative, the limit must be zero. Hence, the original inequality holds, and the limit is zero.

Alternatively, since the max term converges to e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a constant, and |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, then the product goes to zero. Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the left-hand side limit is zero.

Therefore, the generating functions converge because the difference between them goes to zero, which implies that the binomial distribution&#x27;s generating function converges to the Poisson generating function, which is e^{λ(s - 1)}. Because (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)^n ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ} as n → ∞. Wait, actually, let me check that.

Wait, the generating function of a binomial distribution with parameters n and p is (1 - p + p s)^n = (1 + p(s - 1))^n. If we let p = λₙ /n, then it&#x27;s (1 + (λₙ /n)(s - 1))^n. As n → ∞, this tends to e^{λ(s - 1)}, which is the generating function of Poisson(λ). So, indeed, the convergence of the generating functions implies convergence in distribution, hence in probability as well.

But the problem mentions this is an application of the convergence theorem in probability, demonstrating that the generating function converges. So, the key step is showing that the difference between the generating functions goes to zero, which we did by bounding it with |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| times a bounded term, hence the limit is zero.

Therefore, the original inequality is proven, and the limit is zero.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

To show that the limit of the absolute difference between the two expressions is bounded by zero, we start by considering the function \( f(x) = \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^n \). We use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) to bound the difference \( |f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda)| \).

By MVT, there exists some \( c \) between \( \lambda_n \) and \( \lambda \) such that:
\[
f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda) = f&#x27;(c)(\lambda_n - \lambda)
\]
The derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) is calculated as:
\[
f&#x27;(x) = - (1 - s) \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n-1}
\]
Taking the absolute value, we get:
\[
|f&#x27;(c)| = |1 - s| \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right|^{n-1}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), \( \lambda_n \to \lambda \), so \( c \approx \lambda \). The term \( \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right)^{n-1} \) approximates \( e^{-(1 - s)c} \), which is bounded. 

Using the inequality for the difference of powers, we have:
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq n |a - b| \max\{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}\}
\]
where \( a = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n} \) and \( b = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n} \). The difference \( |a - b| \) is:
\[
|a - b| = \left| (1 - s) \frac{\lambda - \lambda_n}{n} \right| = \frac{|1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda|}{n}
\]
Thus,
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \max\left\{\left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n}\right|^{n-1}, \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n}\right|^{n-1}\right\}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), the max term converges to \( e^{-(1 - s)\lambda} \), a constant. Since \( |\lambda_n - \lambda| \to 0 \), the product \( |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \cdot C \) tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the absolute difference is bounded by zero, proving the result:

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s see. I need to show that the limit of the absolute difference between two expressions is less than or equal to the limit of |1 - s| |λₙ - λ|, which is zero. And this is related to the convergence of generating functions from binomial to Poisson distributions. Hmm, okay.

First, let me parse the problem. The main inequality to show is:

limₙ→∞ |(1 - (1 - s)(λₙ/n))ⁿ - (1 - (1 - s)(λ/n))ⁿ| ≤ limₙ→∞ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| = 0

Given that λₙ = n pₙ and λₙ → λ as n → ∞ because n pₙ → λ. So, λₙ - λ tends to zero as n increases. That makes sense since if n pₙ approaches λ, then λₙ = n pₙ is approaching λ, so their difference goes to zero. Therefore, |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, and multiplied by |1 - s|, which is a constant with respect to n, the right-hand side limit is zero. So, if I can show that the left-hand side is bounded by this term that goes to zero, then the squeeze theorem would imply that the left-hand side limit is also zero.

Okay, so the key is to bound |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n)ⁿ - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)ⁿ| by |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| for each n, and then take the limit. But how do I get that bound?

Maybe I can use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) for functions. If I consider the function f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)ⁿ, then the difference would be f(λₙ) - f(λ). By MVT, this is equal to f’(c)(λₙ - λ) for some c between λₙ and λ. Then, the absolute value would be |f’(c)| |λₙ - λ|. If I can show that |f’(c)| ≤ |1 - s|, then multiplying by |λₙ - λ| gives the desired bound.

Let me try that. Let’s define f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^n. Then, the derivative f’(x) is n * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1) * (- (1 - s)/n) = - (1 - s) * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1).

So, |f’(c)| = |1 - s| * (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}.

Now, I need to bound (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. Since c is between λₙ and λ, and λₙ → λ, then c ≈ λ for large n. But even more, as n → ∞, c/n ≈ λ/n, which goes to zero. So, (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is similar to (1 - o(1)/n)^n, which tends to e^{- (1 - s)c}. But wait, actually, if c/n is small, then (1 - a/n)^n ≈ e^{-a}, so here it would be approximately e^{- (1 - s)c}. However, since c is between λₙ and λ, which converges to λ, then as n → ∞, this term would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. But since we&#x27;re taking the absolute value, and exponentials are positive, this would just be e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. But how does that help me?

Wait, but in the derivative f’(c), we have (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. For finite n, how can I bound this term? Let&#x27;s see. Since (1 - (1 - s)c/n) is a term that is less than 1 in magnitude if (1 - s)c/n is positive. However, s is a variable in the generating function, typically in [0,1] for probability generating functions, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify. Wait, the generating function for a binomial distribution is (1 - p + p s)^n, which would correspond to s in [0,1] perhaps? But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify the domain of s, so maybe s is a complex variable? Hmm, the problem mentions &quot;the generating function of a sequence of binomially distributed random variables converges to the generating function of the Poisson distribution.&quot; So perhaps s is a real number in the context of probability generating functions, which are defined for |s| ≤ 1.

But maybe I can proceed without knowing exactly. Let&#x27;s suppose that s is such that |1 - (1 - s)c/n| &lt; 1 for all n sufficiently large. If (1 - s)c/n is positive and less than 1, then the term inside the absolute value is less than 1. But regardless, when raising to the power n, if the base is approaching 1 from below, then (1 - a/n)^n approaches e^{-a}. So perhaps the term (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is bounded by some constant for all n.

But maybe instead of trying to bound the derivative directly, I can use an inequality for the difference of exponentials. Wait, but these are finite n terms. Alternatively, use the inequality |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}}. Is that a valid inequality?

Yes, because for any a and b, |aⁿ - bⁿ| = |a - b| |a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1}| ≤ |a - b| n max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}.

So maybe applying this with a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n and b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n.

Then, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Compute |a - b| = |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n) - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)| = |(1 - s)(λ - λₙ)/n| = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n.

Therefore, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n * (|1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n) * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} } = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

So, the left-hand side of our original inequality is |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Now, to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity. The term |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| tends to |1 - s| * 0 = 0. But what about the max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}?

If we can show that max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} is bounded as n → ∞, then the entire expression tends to zero. Let&#x27;s check |a|^{n - 1} and |b|^{n - 1}.

First, let&#x27;s recall that λₙ = n pₙ → λ, so for large n, λₙ is close to λ.

Compute a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n. As n → ∞, (1 - s)λₙ/n ≈ (1 - s)λ/n → 0. So, a ≈ 1 - o(1)/n, so as n increases, a approaches 1. Similarly, b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n also approaches 1.

Therefore, both |a| and |b| are approximately 1 - something small. The question is, when you raise such a term to the power n - 1, does it approach a finite limit?

Yes. For example, (1 - c/n)^n → e^{-c} as n → ∞. So, |a|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λₙ} as n → ∞. Similarly, |b|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ}.

Since λₙ → λ, both exponents approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. Therefore, the max of these two terms would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. Therefore, max{|a|^{n -1}, |b|^{n -1}} is bounded as n → ∞.

Therefore, the entire expression |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * C for some constant C. Since |λₙ - λ| → 0, the product tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the left-hand side is bounded above by zero (since the right-hand side limit is zero), and because absolute values are non-negative, the limit must be zero. Hence, the original inequality holds, and the limit is zero.

Alternatively, since the max term converges to e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a constant, and |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, then the product goes to zero. Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the left-hand side limit is zero.

Therefore, the generating functions converge because the difference between them goes to zero, which implies that the binomial distribution&#x27;s generating function converges to the Poisson generating function, which is e^{λ(s - 1)}. Because (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)^n ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ} as n → ∞. Wait, actually, let me check that.

Wait, the generating function of a binomial distribution with parameters n and p is (1 - p + p s)^n = (1 + p(s - 1))^n. If we let p = λₙ /n, then it&#x27;s (1 + (λₙ /n)(s - 1))^n. As n → ∞, this tends to e^{λ(s - 1)}, which is the generating function of Poisson(λ). So, indeed, the convergence of the generating functions implies convergence in distribution, hence in probability as well.

But the problem mentions this is an application of the convergence theorem in probability, demonstrating that the generating function converges. So, the key step is showing that the difference between the generating functions goes to zero, which we did by bounding it with |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| times a bounded term, hence the limit is zero.

Therefore, the original inequality is proven, and the limit is zero.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

To show that the limit of the absolute difference between the two expressions is bounded by zero, we start by considering the function \( f(x) = \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^n \). We use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) to bound the difference \( |f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda)| \).

By MVT, there exists some \( c \) between \( \lambda_n \) and \( \lambda \) such that:
\[
f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda) = f&#x27;(c)(\lambda_n - \lambda)
\]
The derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) is calculated as:
\[
f&#x27;(x) = - (1 - s) \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n-1}
\]
Taking the absolute value, we get:
\[
|f&#x27;(c)| = |1 - s| \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right|^{n-1}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), \( \lambda_n \to \lambda \), so \( c \approx \lambda \). The term \( \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right)^{n-1} \) approximates \( e^{-(1 - s)c} \), which is bounded. 

Using the inequality for the difference of powers, we have:
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq n |a - b| \max\{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}\}
\]
where \( a = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n} \) and \( b = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n} \). The difference \( |a - b| \) is:
\[
|a - b| = \left| (1 - s) \frac{\lambda - \lambda_n}{n} \right| = \frac{|1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda|}{n}
\]
Thus,
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \max\left\{\left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n}\right|^{n-1}, \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n}\right|^{n-1}\right\}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), the max term converges to \( e^{-(1 - s)\lambda} \), a constant. Since \( |\lambda_n - \lambda| \to 0 \), the product \( |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \cdot C \) tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the absolute difference is bounded by zero, proving the result:

Let me try that. Let’s define f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^n. Then, the derivative f’(x) is n * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1) * (- (1 - s)/n) = - (1 - s) * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1).

So, |f’(c)| = |1 - s| * (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}.

Now, I need to bound (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. Since c is between λₙ and λ, and λₙ → λ, then c ≈ λ for large n. But even more, as n → ∞, c/n ≈ λ/n, which goes to zero. So, (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is similar to (1 - o(1)/n)^n, which tends to e^{- (1 - s)c}.

So maybe applying this with a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n and b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n.

Then, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Compute |a - b| = |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n) - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)| = |(1 - s)(λ - λₙ)/n| = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n.

Therefore, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n * (|1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n) * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} } = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

So, the left-hand side of our original inequality is |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Now, to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity. The term |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| tends to |1 - s| * 0 = 0. But what about the max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}?

If we can show that max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} is bounded as n → ∞, then the entire expression tends to zero. Let&#x27;s check |a|^{n - 1} and |b|^{n - 1}.

First, let&#x27;s recall that λₙ = n pₙ → λ, so for large n, λₙ is close to λ.

Compute a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n. As n → ∞, (1 - s)λₙ/n ≈ (1 - s)λ/n → 0. So, a ≈ 1 - o(1)/n, so as n increases, a approaches 1. Similarly, b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n also approaches 1.

Therefore, both |a| and |b| are approximately 1 - something small. The question is, when you raise such a term to the power n - 1, does it approach a finite limit?

Yes. For example, (1 - c/n)^n → e^{-c} as n → ∞. So, |a|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λₙ} as n → ∞. Similarly, |b|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ}.

Since λₙ → λ, both exponents approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. Therefore, the max of these two terms would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. Therefore, max{|a|^{n -1}, |b|^{n -1}} is bounded as n → ∞.

Therefore, the entire expression |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * C for some constant C. Since |λₙ - λ| → 0, the product tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the left-hand side is bounded above by zero (since the right-hand side limit is zero), and because absolute values are non-negative, the limit must be zero. Hence, the original inequality holds, and the limit is zero.

Alternatively, since the max term converges to e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a constant, and |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, then the product goes to zero. Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the left-hand side limit is zero.

Therefore, the generating functions converge because the difference between them goes to zero, which implies that the binomial distribution&#x27;s generating function converges to the Poisson generating function, which is e^{λ(s - 1)}. Because (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)^n ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ} as n → ∞. Wait, actually, let me check that.

Wait, the generating function of a binomial distribution with parameters n and p is (1 - p + p s)^n = (1 + p(s - 1))^n. If we let p = λₙ /n, then it&#x27;s (1 + (λₙ /n)(s - 1))^n. As n → ∞, this tends to e^{λ(s - 1)}, which is the generating function of Poisson(λ). So, indeed, the convergence of the generating functions implies convergence in distribution, hence in probability as well.

But the problem mentions this is an application of the convergence theorem in probability, demonstrating that the generating function converges. So, the key step is showing that the difference between the generating functions goes to zero, which we did by bounding it with |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| times a bounded term, hence the limit is zero.

Therefore, the original inequality is proven, and the limit is zero.

**Final Answer**

&lt;/think&gt;

To show that the limit of the absolute difference between the two expressions is bounded by zero, we start by considering the function \( f(x) = \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^n \). We use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) to bound the difference \( |f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda)| \).

By MVT, there exists some \( c \) between \( \lambda_n \) and \( \lambda \) such that:
\[
f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda) = f&#x27;(c)(\lambda_n - \lambda)
\]
The derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) is calculated as:
\[
f&#x27;(x) = - (1 - s) \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n-1}
\]
Taking the absolute value, we get:
\[
|f&#x27;(c)| = |1 - s| \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right|^{n-1}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), \( \lambda_n \to \lambda \), so \( c \approx \lambda \). The term \( \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right)^{n-1} \) approximates \( e^{-(1 - s)c} \), which is bounded. 

Using the inequality for the difference of powers, we have:
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq n |a - b| \max\{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}\}
\]
where \( a = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n} \) and \( b = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n} \). The difference \( |a - b| \) is:
\[
|a - b| = \left| (1 - s) \frac{\lambda - \lambda_n}{n} \right| = \frac{|1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda|}{n}
\]
Thus,
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \max\left\{\left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n}\right|^{n-1}, \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n}\right|^{n-1}\right\}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), the max term converges to \( e^{-(1 - s)\lambda} \), a constant. Since \( |\lambda_n - \lambda| \to 0 \), the product \( |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \cdot C \) tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the absolute difference is bounded by zero, proving the result:

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s see. I need to show that the limit of the absolute difference between two expressions is less than or equal to the limit of |1 - s| |λₙ - λ|, which is zero. And this is related to the convergence of generating functions from binomial to Poisson distributions. Hmm, okay.

First, let me parse the problem. The main inequality to show is:

limₙ→∞ |(1 - (1 - s)(λₙ/n))ⁿ - (1 - (1 - s)(λ/n))ⁿ| ≤ limₙ→∞ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| = 0

Given that λₙ = n pₙ and λₙ → λ as n → ∞ because n pₙ → λ. So, λₙ - λ tends to zero as n increases. That makes sense since if n pₙ approaches λ, then λₙ = n pₙ is approaching λ, so their difference goes to zero. Therefore, |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, and multiplied by |1 - s|, which is a constant with respect to n, the right-hand side limit is zero. So, if I can show that the left-hand side is bounded by this term that goes to zero, then the squeeze theorem would imply that the left-hand side limit is also zero.

Okay, so the key is to bound |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n)ⁿ - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)ⁿ| by |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| for each n, and then take the limit. But how do I get that bound?

Maybe I can use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) for functions. If I consider the function f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)ⁿ, then the difference would be f(λₙ) - f(λ). By MVT, this is equal to f’(c)(λₙ - λ) for some c between λₙ and λ. Then, the absolute value would be |f’(c)| |λₙ - λ|. If I can show that |f’(c)| ≤ |1 - s|, then multiplying by |λₙ - λ| gives the desired bound.

Let me try that. Let’s define f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^n. Then, the derivative f’(x) is n * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1) * (- (1 - s)/n) = - (1 - s) * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1).

So, |f’(c)| = |1 - s| * (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}.

Now, I need to bound (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. Since c is between λₙ and λ, and λₙ → λ, then c ≈ λ for large n. But even more, as n → ∞, c/n ≈ λ/n, which goes to zero. So, (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is similar to (1 - o(1)/n)^n, which tends to e^{- (1 - s)c}. But wait, actually, if c/n is small, then (1 - a/n)^n ≈ e^{-a}, so here it would be approximately e^{- (1 - s)c}. However, since c is between λₙ and λ, which converges to λ, then as n → ∞, this term would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. But since we&#x27;re taking the absolute value, and exponentials are positive, this would just be e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. But how does that help me?

Wait, but in the derivative f’(c), we have (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. For finite n, how can I bound this term? Let&#x27;s see. Since (1 - (1 - s)c/n) is a term that is less than 1 in magnitude if (1 - s)c/n is positive. However, s is a variable in the generating function, typically in [0,1] for probability generating functions, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify. Wait, the generating function for a binomial distribution is (1 - p + p s)^n, which would correspond to s in [0,1] perhaps? But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify the domain of s, so maybe s is a complex variable? Hmm, the problem mentions &quot;the generating function of a sequence of binomially distributed random variables converges to the generating function of the Poisson distribution.&quot; So perhaps s is a real number in the context of probability generating functions, which are defined for |s| ≤ 1.

But maybe I can proceed without knowing exactly. Let&#x27;s suppose that s is such that |1 - (1 - s)c/n| &lt; 1 for all n sufficiently large. If (1 - s)c/n is positive and less than 1, then the term inside the absolute value is less than 1. But regardless, when raising to the power n, if the base is approaching 1 from below, then (1 - a/n)^n approaches e^{-a}. So perhaps the term (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is bounded by some constant for all n.

But maybe instead of trying to bound the derivative directly, I can use an inequality for the difference of exponentials. Wait, but these are finite n terms. Alternatively, use the inequality |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}}. Is that a valid inequality?

Yes, because for any a and b, |aⁿ - bⁿ| = |a - b| |a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1}| ≤ |a - b| n max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}.

So maybe applying this with a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n and b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n.

Then, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Compute |a - b| = |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n) - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)| = |(1 - s)(λ - λₙ)/n| = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n.

Therefore, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n * (|1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n) * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} } = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

So, the left-hand side of our original inequality is |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Now, to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity. The term |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| tends to |1 - s| * 0 = 0. But what about the max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}?

If we can show that max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} is bounded as n → ∞, then the entire expression tends to zero. Let&#x27;s check |a|^{n - 1} and |b|^{n - 1}.

First, let&#x27;s recall that λₙ = n pₙ → λ, so for large n, λₙ is close to λ.

Compute a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n. As n → ∞, (1 - s)λₙ/n ≈ (1 - s)λ/n → 0. So, a ≈ 1 - o(1)/n, so as n increases, a approaches 1. Similarly, b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n also approaches 1.

Therefore, both |a| and |b| are approximately 1 - something small. The question is, when you raise such a term to the power n - 1, does it approach a finite limit?

Yes. For example, (1 - c/n)^n → e^{-c} as n → ∞. So, |a|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λₙ} as n → ∞. Similarly, |b|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ}.

Since λₙ → λ, both exponents approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. Therefore, the max of these two terms would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. Therefore, max{|a|^{n -1}, |b|^{n -1}} is bounded as n → ∞.

Therefore, the entire expression |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * C for some constant C. Since |λₙ - λ| → 0, the product tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the left-hand side is bounded above by zero (since the right-hand side limit is zero), and because absolute values are non-negative, the limit must be zero. Hence, the original inequality holds, and the limit is zero.

Alternatively, since the max term converges to e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a constant, and |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, then the product goes to zero. Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the left-hand side limit is zero.

Therefore, the generating functions converge because the difference between them goes to zero, which implies that the binomial distribution&#x27;s generating function converges to the Poisson generating function, which is e^{λ(s - 1)}. Because (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)^n ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ} as n → ∞. Wait, actually, let me check that.

Wait, the generating function of a binomial distribution with parameters n and p is (1 - p + p s)^n = (1 + p(s - 1))^n. If we let p = λₙ /n, then it&#x27;s (1 + (λₙ /n)(s - 1))^n. As n → ∞, this tends to e^{λ(s - 1)}, which is the generating function of Poisson(λ). So, indeed, the convergence of the generating functions implies convergence in distribution, hence in probability as well.

But the problem mentions this is an application of the convergence theorem in probability, demonstrating that the generating function converges. So, the key step is showing that the difference between the generating functions goes to zero, which we did by bounding it with |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| times a bounded term, hence the limit is zero.

Therefore, the original inequality is proven, and the limit is zero.

To show that the limit of the absolute difference between the two expressions is bounded by zero, we start by considering the function \( f(x) = \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^n \). We use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) to bound the difference \( |f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda)| \).

By MVT, there exists some \( c \) between \( \lambda_n \) and \( \lambda \) such that:
\[
f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda) = f&#x27;(c)(\lambda_n - \lambda)
\]
The derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) is calculated as:
\[
f&#x27;(x) = - (1 - s) \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n-1}
\]
Taking the absolute value, we get:
\[
|f&#x27;(c)| = |1 - s| \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right|^{n-1}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), \( \lambda_n \to \lambda \), so \( c \approx \lambda \). The term \( \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right)^{n-1} \) approximates \( e^{-(1 - s)c} \), which is bounded. 

Using the inequality for the difference of powers, we have:
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq n |a - b| \max\{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}\}
\]
where \( a = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n} \) and \( b = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n} \). The difference \( |a - b| \) is:
\[
|a - b| = \left| (1 - s) \frac{\lambda - \lambda_n}{n} \right| = \frac{|1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda|}{n}
\]
Thus,
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \max\left\{\left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n}\right|^{n-1}, \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n}\right|^{n-1}\right\}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), the max term converges to \( e^{-(1 - s)\lambda} \), a constant. Since \( |\lambda_n - \lambda| \to 0 \), the product \( |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \cdot C \) tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the absolute difference is bounded by zero, proving the result:

By MVT, this is equal to f’(c)(λₙ - λ) for some c between λₙ and λ. Then, the absolute value would be |f’(c)| |λₙ - λ|. If I can show that |f’(c)| ≤ |1 - s|, then multiplying by |λₙ - λ| gives the desired bound.

Let me try that. Let’s define f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^n. Then, the derivative f’(x) is n * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1) * (- (1 - s)/n) = - (1 - s) * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1).

So, |f’(c)| = |1 - s| * (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}.

Now, I need to bound (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. Since c is between λₙ and λ, and λₙ → λ, then c ≈ λ for large n. But even more, as n → ∞, c/n ≈ λ/n, which goes to zero. So, (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is similar to (1 - o(1)/n)^n, which tends to e^{- (1 - s)c}. But wait, actually, if c/n is small, then (1 - a/n)^n ≈ e^{-a}, so here it would be approximately e^{- (1 - s)c}.

Yes, because for any a and b, |aⁿ - bⁿ| = |a - b| |a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1}| ≤ |a - b| n max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}.

So maybe applying this with a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n and b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n.

Then, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Compute |a - b| = |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n) - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)| = |(1 - s)(λ - λₙ)/n| = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n.

Therefore, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n * (|1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n) * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} } = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

So, the left-hand side of our original inequality is |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Now, to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity. The term |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| tends to |1 - s| * 0 = 0. But what about the max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}?

If we can show that max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} is bounded as n → ∞, then the entire expression tends to zero. Let&#x27;s check |a|^{n - 1} and |b|^{n - 1}.

First, let&#x27;s recall that λₙ = n pₙ → λ, so for large n, λₙ is close to λ.

Compute a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n. As n → ∞, (1 - s)λₙ/n ≈ (1 - s)λ/n → 0. So, a ≈ 1 - o(1)/n, so as n increases, a approaches 1. Similarly, b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n also approaches 1.

Therefore, both |a| and |b| are approximately 1 - something small. The question is, when you raise such a term to the power n - 1, does it approach a finite limit?

Yes. For example, (1 - c/n)^n → e^{-c} as n → ∞. So, |a|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λₙ} as n → ∞. Similarly, |b|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ}.

Since λₙ → λ, both exponents approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. Therefore, the max of these two terms would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. Therefore, max{|a|^{n -1}, |b|^{n -1}} is bounded as n → ∞.

Therefore, the entire expression |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * C for some constant C. Since |λₙ - λ| → 0, the product tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the left-hand side is bounded above by zero (since the right-hand side limit is zero), and because absolute values are non-negative, the limit must be zero. Hence, the original inequality holds, and the limit is zero.

Alternatively, since the max term converges to e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a constant, and |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, then the product goes to zero. Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the left-hand side limit is zero.

Therefore, the generating functions converge because the difference between them goes to zero, which implies that the binomial distribution&#x27;s generating function converges to the Poisson generating function, which is e^{λ(s - 1)}. Because (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)^n ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ} as n → ∞. Wait, actually, let me check that.

Wait, the generating function of a binomial distribution with parameters n and p is (1 - p + p s)^n = (1 + p(s - 1))^n. If we let p = λₙ /n, then it&#x27;s (1 + (λₙ /n)(s - 1))^n. As n → ∞, this tends to e^{λ(s - 1)}, which is the generating function of Poisson(λ). So, indeed, the convergence of the generating functions implies convergence in distribution, hence in probability as well.

But the problem mentions this is an application of the convergence theorem in probability, demonstrating that the generating function converges. So, the key step is showing that the difference between the generating functions goes to zero, which we did by bounding it with |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| times a bounded term, hence the limit is zero.

Therefore, the original inequality is proven, and the limit is zero.

To show that the limit of the absolute difference between the two expressions is bounded by zero, we start by considering the function \( f(x) = \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^n \). We use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) to bound the difference \( |f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda)| \).

By MVT, there exists some \( c \) between \( \lambda_n \) and \( \lambda \) such that:
\[
f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda) = f&#x27;(c)(\lambda_n - \lambda)
\]
The derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) is calculated as:
\[
f&#x27;(x) = - (1 - s) \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n-1}
\]
Taking the absolute value, we get:
\[
|f&#x27;(c)| = |1 - s| \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right|^{n-1}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), \( \lambda_n \to \lambda \), so \( c \approx \lambda \). The term \( \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right)^{n-1} \) approximates \( e^{-(1 - s)c} \), which is bounded. 

Using the inequality for the difference of powers, we have:
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq n |a - b| \max\{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}\}
\]
where \( a = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n} \) and \( b = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n} \). The difference \( |a - b| \) is:
\[
|a - b| = \left| (1 - s) \frac{\lambda - \lambda_n}{n} \right| = \frac{|1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda|}{n}
\]
Thus,
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \max\left\{\left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n}\right|^{n-1}, \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n}\right|^{n-1}\right\}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), the max term converges to \( e^{-(1 - s)\lambda} \), a constant. Since \( |\lambda_n - \lambda| \to 0 \), the product \( |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \cdot C \) tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the absolute difference is bounded by zero, proving the result:

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s see. I need to show that the limit of the absolute difference between two expressions is less than or equal to the limit of |1 - s| |λₙ - λ|, which is zero. And this is related to the convergence of generating functions from binomial to Poisson distributions. Hmm, okay.

First, let me parse the problem. The main inequality to show is:

limₙ→∞ |(1 - (1 - s)(λₙ/n))ⁿ - (1 - (1 - s)(λ/n))ⁿ| ≤ limₙ→∞ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| = 0

Given that λₙ = n pₙ and λₙ → λ as n → ∞ because n pₙ → λ. So, λₙ - λ tends to zero as n increases. That makes sense since if n pₙ approaches λ, then λₙ = n pₙ is approaching λ, so their difference goes to zero. Therefore, |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, and multiplied by |1 - s|, which is a constant with respect to n, the right-hand side limit is zero. So, if I can show that the left-hand side is bounded by this term that goes to zero, then the squeeze theorem would imply that the left-hand side limit is also zero.

Okay, so the key is to bound |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n)ⁿ - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)ⁿ| by |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| for each n, and then take the limit. But how do I get that bound?

Maybe I can use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) for functions. If I consider the function f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)ⁿ, then the difference would be f(λₙ) - f(λ). By MVT, this is equal to f’(c)(λₙ - λ) for some c between λₙ and λ. Then, the absolute value would be |f’(c)| |λₙ - λ|. If I can show that |f’(c)| ≤ |1 - s|, then multiplying by |λₙ - λ| gives the desired bound.

Let me try that. Let’s define f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^n. Then, the derivative f’(x) is n * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1) * (- (1 - s)/n) = - (1 - s) * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1).

So, |f’(c)| = |1 - s| * (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}.

Now, I need to bound (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. Since c is between λₙ and λ, and λₙ → λ, then c ≈ λ for large n. But even more, as n → ∞, c/n ≈ λ/n, which goes to zero. So, (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is similar to (1 - o(1)/n)^n, which tends to e^{- (1 - s)c}. But wait, actually, if c/n is small, then (1 - a/n)^n ≈ e^{-a}, so here it would be approximately e^{- (1 - s)c}. However, since c is between λₙ and λ, which converges to λ, then as n → ∞, this term would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. But since we&#x27;re taking the absolute value, and exponentials are positive, this would just be e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. But how does that help me?

Wait, but in the derivative f’(c), we have (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. For finite n, how can I bound this term? Let&#x27;s see. Since (1 - (1 - s)c/n) is a term that is less than 1 in magnitude if (1 - s)c/n is positive. However, s is a variable in the generating function, typically in [0,1] for probability generating functions, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify. Wait, the generating function for a binomial distribution is (1 - p + p s)^n, which would correspond to s in [0,1] perhaps? But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify the domain of s, so maybe s is a complex variable? Hmm, the problem mentions &quot;the generating function of a sequence of binomially distributed random variables converges to the generating function of the Poisson distribution.&quot; So perhaps s is a real number in the context of probability generating functions, which are defined for |s| ≤ 1.

But maybe I can proceed without knowing exactly. Let&#x27;s suppose that s is such that |1 - (1 - s)c/n| &lt; 1 for all n sufficiently large. If (1 - s)c/n is positive and less than 1, then the term inside the absolute value is less than 1. But regardless, when raising to the power n, if the base is approaching 1 from below, then (1 - a/n)^n approaches e^{-a}. So perhaps the term (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is bounded by some constant for all n.

But maybe instead of trying to bound the derivative directly, I can use an inequality for the difference of exponentials. Wait, but these are finite n terms. Alternatively, use the inequality |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}}. Is that a valid inequality?

Yes, because for any a and b, |aⁿ - bⁿ| = |a - b| |a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1}| ≤ |a - b| n max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}.

So maybe applying this with a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n and b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n.

Then, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Compute |a - b| = |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n) - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)| = |(1 - s)(λ - λₙ)/n| = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n.

Therefore, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n * (|1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n) * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} } = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

So, the left-hand side of our original inequality is |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Now, to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity. The term |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| tends to |1 - s| * 0 = 0. But what about the max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}?

If we can show that max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} is bounded as n → ∞, then the entire expression tends to zero. Let&#x27;s check |a|^{n - 1} and |b|^{n - 1}.

First, let&#x27;s recall that λₙ = n pₙ → λ, so for large n, λₙ is close to λ.

Compute a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n. As n → ∞, (1 - s)λₙ/n ≈ (1 - s)λ/n → 0. So, a ≈ 1 - o(1)/n, so as n increases, a approaches 1. Similarly, b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n also approaches 1.

Therefore, both |a| and |b| are approximately 1 - something small. The question is, when you raise such a term to the power n - 1, does it approach a finite limit?

Yes. For example, (1 - c/n)^n → e^{-c} as n → ∞. So, |a|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λₙ} as n → ∞. Similarly, |b|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ}.

Since λₙ → λ, both exponents approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. Therefore, the max of these two terms would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. Therefore, max{|a|^{n -1}, |b|^{n -1}} is bounded as n → ∞.

Therefore, the entire expression |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * C for some constant C. Since |λₙ - λ| → 0, the product tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the left-hand side is bounded above by zero (since the right-hand side limit is zero), and because absolute values are non-negative, the limit must be zero. Hence, the original inequality holds, and the limit is zero.

Alternatively, since the max term converges to e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a constant, and |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, then the product goes to zero. Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the left-hand side limit is zero.

Therefore, the generating functions converge because the difference between them goes to zero, which implies that the binomial distribution&#x27;s generating function converges to the Poisson generating function, which is e^{λ(s - 1)}. Because (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)^n ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ} as n → ∞. Wait, actually, let me check that.

Wait, the generating function of a binomial distribution with parameters n and p is (1 - p + p s)^n = (1 + p(s - 1))^n. If we let p = λₙ /n, then it&#x27;s (1 + (λₙ /n)(s - 1))^n. As n → ∞, this tends to e^{λ(s - 1)}, which is the generating function of Poisson(λ). So, indeed, the convergence of the generating functions implies convergence in distribution, hence in probability as well.

But the problem mentions this is an application of the convergence theorem in probability, demonstrating that the generating function converges. So, the key step is showing that the difference between the generating functions goes to zero, which we did by bounding it with |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| times a bounded term, hence the limit is zero.

Therefore, the original inequality is proven, and the limit is zero.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

To show that the limit of the absolute difference between the two expressions is bounded by zero, we start by considering the function \( f(x) = \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^n \). We use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) to bound the difference \( |f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda)| \).

By MVT, there exists some \( c \) between \( \lambda_n \) and \( \lambda \) such that:
\[
f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda) = f&#x27;(c)(\lambda_n - \lambda)
\]
The derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) is calculated as:
\[
f&#x27;(x) = - (1 - s) \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n-1}
\]
Taking the absolute value, we get:
\[
|f&#x27;(c)| = |1 - s| \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right|^{n-1}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), \( \lambda_n \to \lambda \), so \( c \approx \lambda \). The term \( \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right)^{n-1} \) approximates \( e^{-(1 - s)c} \), which is bounded. 

Using the inequality for the difference of powers, we have:
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq n |a - b| \max\{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}\}
\]
where \( a = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n} \) and \( b = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n} \). The difference \( |a - b| \) is:
\[
|a - b| = \left| (1 - s) \frac{\lambda - \lambda_n}{n} \right| = \frac{|1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda|}{n}
\]
Thus,
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \max\left\{\left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n}\right|^{n-1}, \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n}\right|^{n-1}\right\}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), the max term converges to \( e^{-(1 - s)\lambda} \), a constant. Since \( |\lambda_n - \lambda| \to 0 \), the product \( |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \cdot C \) tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the absolute difference is bounded by zero, proving the result:

By MVT, this is equal to f’(c)(λₙ - λ) for some c between λₙ and λ. Then, the absolute value would be |f’(c)| |λₙ - λ|. If I can show that |f’(c)| ≤ |1 - s|, then multiplying by |λₙ - λ| gives the desired bound.

Let me try that. Let’s define f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^n. Then, the derivative f’(x) is n * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1) * (- (1 - s)/n) = - (1 - s) * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1).

So, |f’(c)| = |1 - s| * (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}.

Now, I need to bound (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. Since c is between λₙ and λ, and λₙ → λ, then c ≈ λ for large n. But even more, as n → ∞, c/n ≈ λ/n, which goes to zero. So, (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is similar to (1 - o(1)/n)^n, which tends to e^{- (1 - s)c}.

Yes, because for any a and b, |aⁿ - bⁿ| = |a - b| |a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1}| ≤ |a - b| n max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}.

So maybe applying this with a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n and b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n.

Then, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Compute |a - b| = |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n) - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)| = |(1 - s)(λ - λₙ)/n| = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n.

Therefore, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n * (|1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n) * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} } = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

So, the left-hand side of our original inequality is |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Now, to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity. The term |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| tends to |1 - s| * 0 = 0. But what about the max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}?

If we can show that max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} is bounded as n → ∞, then the entire expression tends to zero. Let&#x27;s check |a|^{n - 1} and |b|^{n - 1}.

First, let&#x27;s recall that λₙ = n pₙ → λ, so for large n, λₙ is close to λ.

Compute a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n. As n → ∞, (1 - s)λₙ/n ≈ (1 - s)λ/n → 0. So, a ≈ 1 - o(1)/n, so as n increases, a approaches 1. Similarly, b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n also approaches 1.

Therefore, both |a| and |b| are approximately 1 - something small. The question is, when you raise such a term to the power n - 1, does it approach a finite limit?

Yes. For example, (1 - c/n)^n → e^{-c} as n → ∞. So, |a|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λₙ} as n → ∞. Similarly, |b|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ}.

Since λₙ → λ, both exponents approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. Therefore, the max of these two terms would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. Therefore, max{|a|^{n -1}, |b|^{n -1}} is bounded as n → ∞.

Therefore, the entire expression |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * C for some constant C. Since |λₙ - λ| → 0, the product tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the left-hand side is bounded above by zero (since the right-hand side limit is zero), and because absolute values are non-negative, the limit must be zero. Hence, the original inequality holds, and the limit is zero.

Alternatively, since the max term converges to e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a constant, and |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, then the product goes to zero. Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the left-hand side limit is zero.

Therefore, the generating functions converge because the difference between them goes to zero, which implies that the binomial distribution&#x27;s generating function converges to the Poisson generating function, which is e^{λ(s - 1)}. Because (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)^n ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ} as n → ∞. Wait, actually, let me check that.

Wait, the generating function of a binomial distribution with parameters n and p is (1 - p + p s)^n = (1 + p(s - 1))^n. If we let p = λₙ /n, then it&#x27;s (1 + (λₙ /n)(s - 1))^n. As n → ∞, this tends to e^{λ(s - 1)}, which is the generating function of Poisson(λ). So, indeed, the convergence of the generating functions implies convergence in distribution, hence in probability as well.

But the problem mentions this is an application of the convergence theorem in probability, demonstrating that the generating function converges. So, the key step is showing that the difference between the generating functions goes to zero, which we did by bounding it with |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| times a bounded term, hence the limit is zero.

Therefore, the original inequality is proven, and the limit is zero.

&lt;/think&gt;

To show that the limit of the absolute difference between the two expressions is bounded by zero, we start by considering the function \( f(x) = \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^n \). We use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) to bound the difference \( |f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda)| \).

By MVT, there exists some \( c \) between \( \lambda_n \) and \( \lambda \) such that:
\[
f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda) = f&#x27;(c)(\lambda_n - \lambda)
\]
The derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) is calculated as:
\[
f&#x27;(x) = - (1 - s) \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n-1}
\]
Taking the absolute value, we get:
\[
|f&#x27;(c)| = |1 - s| \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right|^{n-1}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), \( \lambda_n \to \lambda \), so \( c \approx \lambda \). The term \( \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right)^{n-1} \) approximates \( e^{-(1 - s)c} \), which is bounded. 

Using the inequality for the difference of powers, we have:
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq n |a - b| \max\{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}\}
\]
where \( a = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n} \) and \( b = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n} \). The difference \( |a - b| \) is:
\[
|a - b| = \left| (1 - s) \frac{\lambda - \lambda_n}{n} \right| = \frac{|1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda|}{n}
\]
Thus,
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \max\left\{\left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n}\right|^{n-1}, \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n}\right|^{n-1}\right\}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), the max term converges to \( e^{-(1 - s)\lambda} \), a constant. Since \( |\lambda_n - \lambda| \to 0 \), the product \( |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \cdot C \) tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the absolute difference is bounded by zero, proving the result:

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s see. I need to show that the limit of the absolute difference between two expressions is less than or equal to the limit of |1 - s| |λₙ - λ|, which is zero. And this is related to the convergence of generating functions from binomial to Poisson distributions. Hmm, okay.

First, let me parse the problem. The main inequality to show is:

limₙ→∞ |(1 - (1 - s)(λₙ/n))ⁿ - (1 - (1 - s)(λ/n))ⁿ| ≤ limₙ→∞ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| = 0

Given that λₙ = n pₙ and λₙ → λ as n → ∞ because n pₙ → λ. So, λₙ - λ tends to zero as n increases. That makes sense since if n pₙ approaches λ, then λₙ = n pₙ is approaching λ, so their difference goes to zero. Therefore, |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, and multiplied by |1 - s|, which is a constant with respect to n, the right-hand side limit is zero. So, if I can show that the left-hand side is bounded by this term that goes to zero, then the squeeze theorem would imply that the left-hand side limit is also zero.

Okay, so the key is to bound |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n)ⁿ - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)ⁿ| by |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| for each n, and then take the limit. But how do I get that bound?

Maybe I can use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) for functions. If I consider the function f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)ⁿ, then the difference would be f(λₙ) - f(λ). By MVT, this is equal to f’(c)(λₙ - λ) for some c between λₙ and λ. Then, the absolute value would be |f’(c)| |λₙ - λ|. If I can show that |f’(c)| ≤ |1 - s|, then multiplying by |λₙ - λ| gives the desired bound.

Let me try that. Let’s define f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^n. Then, the derivative f’(x) is n * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1) * (- (1 - s)/n) = - (1 - s) * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1).

So, |f’(c)| = |1 - s| * (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}.

Now, I need to bound (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. Since c is between λₙ and λ, and λₙ → λ, then c ≈ λ for large n. But even more, as n → ∞, c/n ≈ λ/n, which goes to zero. So, (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is similar to (1 - o(1)/n)^n, which tends to e^{- (1 - s)c}. But wait, actually, if c/n is small, then (1 - a/n)^n ≈ e^{-a}, so here it would be approximately e^{- (1 - s)c}. However, since c is between λₙ and λ, which converges to λ, then as n → ∞, this term would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. But since we&#x27;re taking the absolute value, and exponentials are positive, this would just be e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. But how does that help me?

Wait, but in the derivative f’(c), we have (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. For finite n, how can I bound this term? Let&#x27;s see. Since (1 - (1 - s)c/n) is a term that is less than 1 in magnitude if (1 - s)c/n is positive. However, s is a variable in the generating function, typically in [0,1] for probability generating functions, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify. Wait, the generating function for a binomial distribution is (1 - p + p s)^n, which would correspond to s in [0,1] perhaps? But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify the domain of s, so maybe s is a complex variable? Hmm, the problem mentions &quot;the generating function of a sequence of binomially distributed random variables converges to the generating function of the Poisson distribution.&quot; So perhaps s is a real number in the context of probability generating functions, which are defined for |s| ≤ 1.

But maybe I can proceed without knowing exactly. Let&#x27;s suppose that s is such that |1 - (1 - s)c/n| &lt; 1 for all n sufficiently large. If (1 - s)c/n is positive and less than 1, then the term inside the absolute value is less than 1. But regardless, when raising to the power n, if the base is approaching 1 from below, then (1 - a/n)^n approaches e^{-a}. So perhaps the term (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is bounded by some constant for all n.

But maybe instead of trying to bound the derivative directly, I can use an inequality for the difference of exponentials. Wait, but these are finite n terms. Alternatively, use the inequality |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}}. Is that a valid inequality?

Yes, because for any a and b, |aⁿ - bⁿ| = |a - b| |a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1}| ≤ |a - b| n max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}.

So maybe applying this with a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n and b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n.

Then, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Compute |a - b| = |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n) - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)| = |(1 - s)(λ - λₙ)/n| = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n.

Therefore, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n * (|1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n) * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} } = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

So, the left-hand side of our original inequality is |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Now, to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity. The term |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| tends to |1 - s| * 0 = 0. But what about the max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}?

If we can show that max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} is bounded as n → ∞, then the entire expression tends to zero. Let&#x27;s check |a|^{n - 1} and |b|^{n - 1}.

First, let&#x27;s recall that λₙ = n pₙ → λ, so for large n, λₙ is close to λ.

Compute a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n. As n → ∞, (1 - s)λₙ/n ≈ (1 - s)λ/n → 0. So, a ≈ 1 - o(1)/n, so as n increases, a approaches 1. Similarly, b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n also approaches 1.

Therefore, both |a| and |b| are approximately 1 - something small. The question is, when you raise such a term to the power n - 1, does it approach a finite limit?

Yes. For example, (1 - c/n)^n → e^{-c} as n → ∞. So, |a|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λₙ} as n → ∞. Similarly, |b|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ}.

Since λₙ → λ, both exponents approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. Therefore, the max of these two terms would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. Therefore, max{|a|^{n -1}, |b|^{n -1}} is bounded as n → ∞.

Therefore, the entire expression |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * C for some constant C. Since |λₙ - λ| → 0, the product tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the left-hand side is bounded above by zero (since the right-hand side limit is zero), and because absolute values are non-negative, the limit must be zero. Hence, the original inequality holds, and the limit is zero.

Alternatively, since the max term converges to e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a constant, and |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, then the product goes to zero. Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the left-hand side limit is zero.

Therefore, the generating functions converge because the difference between them goes to zero, which implies that the binomial distribution&#x27;s generating function converges to the Poisson generating function, which is e^{λ(s - 1)}. Because (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)^n ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ} as n → ∞. Wait, actually, let me check that.

Wait, the generating function of a binomial distribution with parameters n and p is (1 - p + p s)^n = (1 + p(s - 1))^n. If we let p = λₙ /n, then it&#x27;s (1 + (λₙ /n)(s - 1))^n. As n → ∞, this tends to e^{λ(s - 1)}, which is the generating function of Poisson(λ). So, indeed, the convergence of the generating functions implies convergence in distribution, hence in probability as well.

But the problem mentions this is an application of the convergence theorem in probability, demonstrating that the generating function converges. So, the key step is showing that the difference between the generating functions goes to zero, which we did by bounding it with |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| times a bounded term, hence the limit is zero.

Therefore, the original inequality is proven, and the limit is zero.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

To show that the limit of the absolute difference between the two expressions is bounded by zero, we start by considering the function \( f(x) = \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^n \). We use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) to bound the difference \( |f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda)| \).

By MVT, there exists some \( c \) between \( \lambda_n \) and \( \lambda \) such that:
\[
f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda) = f&#x27;(c)(\lambda_n - \lambda)
\]
The derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) is calculated as:
\[
f&#x27;(x) = - (1 - s) \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n-1}
\]
Taking the absolute value, we get:
\[
|f&#x27;(c)| = |1 - s| \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right|^{n-1}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), \( \lambda_n \to \lambda \), so \( c \approx \lambda \). The term \( \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right)^{n-1} \) approximates \( e^{-(1 - s)c} \), which is bounded. 

Using the inequality for the difference of powers, we have:
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq n |a - b| \max\{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}\}
\]
where \( a = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n} \) and \( b = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n} \). The difference \( |a - b| \) is:
\[
|a - b| = \left| (1 - s) \frac{\lambda - \lambda_n}{n} \right| = \frac{|1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda|}{n}
\]
Thus,
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \max\left\{\left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n}\right|^{n-1}, \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n}\right|^{n-1}\right\}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), the max term converges to \( e^{-(1 - s)\lambda} \), a constant. Since \( |\lambda_n - \lambda| \to 0 \), the product \( |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \cdot C \) tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the absolute difference is bounded by zero, proving the result:

By MVT, this is equal to f’(c)(λₙ - λ) for some c between λₙ and λ. Then, the absolute value would be |f’(c)| |λₙ - λ|. If I can show that |f’(c)| ≤ |1 - s|, then multiplying by |λₙ - λ| gives the desired bound.

Let me try that. Let’s define f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^n. Then, the derivative f’(x) is n * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1) * (- (1 - s)/n) = - (1 - s) * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1).

So, |f’(c)| = |1 - s| * (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}.

Now, I need to bound (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. Since c is between λₙ and λ, and λₙ → λ, then c ≈ λ for large n. But even more, as n → ∞, c/n ≈ λ/n, which goes to zero. So, (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is similar to (1 - o(1)/n)^n, which tends to e^{- (1 - s)c}. But wait, actually, if c/n is small, then (1 - a/n)^n ≈ e^{-a}, so here it would be approximately e^{- (1 - s)c}.

Yes, because for any a and b, |aⁿ - bⁿ| = |a - b| |a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1}| ≤ |a - b| n max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}.

So maybe applying this with a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n and b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n.

Then, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Compute |a - b| = |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n) - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)| = |(1 - s)(λ - λₙ)/n| = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n.

Therefore, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n * (|1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n) * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} } = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

So, the left-hand side of our original inequality is |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Now, to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity. The term |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| tends to |1 - s| * 0 = 0. But what about the max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}?

If we can show that max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} is bounded as n → ∞, then the entire expression tends to zero. Let&#x27;s check |a|^{n - 1} and |b|^{n - 1}.

First, let&#x27;s recall that λₙ = n pₙ → λ, so for large n, λₙ is close to λ.

Compute a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n. As n → ∞, (1 - s)λₙ/n ≈ (1 - s)λ/n → 0. So, a ≈ 1 - o(1)/n, so as n increases, a approaches 1. Similarly, b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n also approaches 1.

Therefore, both |a| and |b| are approximately 1 - something small. The question is, when you raise such a term to the power n - 1, does it approach a finite limit?

Yes. For example, (1 - c/n)^n → e^{-c} as n → ∞. So, |a|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λₙ} as n → ∞. Similarly, |b|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ}.

Since λₙ → λ, both exponents approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. Therefore, the max of these two terms would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. Therefore, max{|a|^{n -1}, |b|^{n -1}} is bounded as n → ∞.

Therefore, the entire expression |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * C for some constant C. Since |λₙ - λ| → 0, the product tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the left-hand side is bounded above by zero (since the right-hand side limit is zero), and because absolute values are non-negative, the limit must be zero. Hence, the original inequality holds, and the limit is zero.

Alternatively, since the max term converges to e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a constant, and |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, then the product goes to zero. Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the left-hand side limit is zero.

Therefore, the generating functions converge because the difference between them goes to zero, which implies that the binomial distribution&#x27;s generating function converges to the Poisson generating function, which is e^{λ(s - 1)}. Because (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)^n ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ} as n → ∞. Wait, actually, let me check that.

Wait, the generating function of a binomial distribution with parameters n and p is (1 - p + p s)^n = (1 + p(s - 1))^n. If we let p = λₙ /n, then it&#x27;s (1 + (λₙ /n)(s - 1))^n. As n → ∞, this tends to e^{λ(s - 1)}, which is the generating function of Poisson(λ). So, indeed, the convergence of the generating functions implies convergence in distribution, hence in probability as well.

But the problem mentions this is an application of the convergence theorem in probability, demonstrating that the generating function converges. So, the key step is showing that the difference between the generating functions goes to zero, which we did by bounding it with |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| times a bounded term, hence the limit is zero.

Therefore, the original inequality is proven, and the limit is zero.

&lt;/think&gt;

To show that the limit of the absolute difference between the two expressions is bounded by zero, we start by considering the function \( f(x) = \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^n \). We use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) to bound the difference \( |f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda)| \).

By MVT, there exists some \( c \) between \( \lambda_n \) and \( \lambda \) such that:
\[
f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda) = f&#x27;(c)(\lambda_n - \lambda)
\]
The derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) is calculated as:
\[
f&#x27;(x) = - (1 - s) \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n-1}
\]
Taking the absolute value, we get:
\[
|f&#x27;(c)| = |1 - s| \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right|^{n-1}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), \( \lambda_n \to \lambda \), so \( c \approx \lambda \). The term \( \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right)^{n-1} \) approximates \( e^{-(1 - s)c} \), which is bounded. 

Using the inequality for the difference of powers, we have:
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq n |a - b| \max\{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}\}
\]
where \( a = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n} \) and \( b = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n} \). The difference \( |a - b| \) is:
\[
|a - b| = \left| (1 - s) \frac{\lambda - \lambda_n}{n} \right| = \frac{|1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda|}{n}
\]
Thus,
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \max\left\{\left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n}\right|^{n-1}, \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n}\right|^{n-1}\right\}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), the max term converges to \( e^{-(1 - s)\lambda} \), a constant. Since \( |\lambda_n - \lambda| \to 0 \), the product \( |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \cdot C \) tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the absolute difference is bounded by zero, proving the result:

limₙ→∞ |(1 - (1 - s)(λₙ/n))ⁿ - (1 - (1 - s)(λ/n))ⁿ| ≤ limₙ→∞ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| = 0

Given that λₙ = n pₙ and λₙ → λ as n → ∞ because n pₙ → λ. So, λₙ - λ tends to zero as n increases. That makes sense since if n pₙ approaches λ, then λₙ = n pₙ is approaching λ, so their difference goes to zero. Therefore, |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, and multiplied by |1 - s|, which is a constant with respect to n, the right-hand side limit is zero. So, if I can show that the left-hand side is bounded by this term that goes to zero, then the squeeze theorem would imply that the left-hand side limit is also zero.

Okay, so the key is to bound |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n)ⁿ - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)ⁿ| by |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| for each n, and then take the limit. But how do I get that bound?

Maybe I can use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) for functions. If I consider the function f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)ⁿ, then the difference would be f(λₙ) - f(λ). By MVT, this is equal to f’(c)(λₙ - λ) for some c between λₙ and λ. Then, the absolute value would be |f’(c)| |λₙ - λ|. If I can show that |f’(c)| ≤ |1 - s|, then multiplying by |λₙ - λ| gives the desired bound.

Let me try that. Let’s define f(x) = (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^n. Then, the derivative f’(x) is n * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1) * (- (1 - s)/n) = - (1 - s) * (1 - (1 - s)x/n)^(n - 1).

So, |f’(c)| = |1 - s| * (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}.

Now, I need to bound (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. Since c is between λₙ and λ, and λₙ → λ, then c ≈ λ for large n. But even more, as n → ∞, c/n ≈ λ/n, which goes to zero. So, (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is similar to (1 - o(1)/n)^n, which tends to e^{- (1 - s)c}. But wait, actually, if c/n is small, then (1 - a/n)^n ≈ e^{-a}, so here it would be approximately e^{- (1 - s)c}. However, since c is between λₙ and λ, which converges to λ, then as n → ∞, this term would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. But since we&#x27;re taking the absolute value, and exponentials are positive, this would just be e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. But how does that help me?

Wait, but in the derivative f’(c), we have (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1}. For finite n, how can I bound this term? Let&#x27;s see. Since (1 - (1 - s)c/n) is a term that is less than 1 in magnitude if (1 - s)c/n is positive. However, s is a variable in the generating function, typically in [0,1] for probability generating functions, but the problem doesn&#x27;t specify. Wait, the generating function for a binomial distribution is (1 - p + p s)^n, which would correspond to s in [0,1] perhaps? But the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify the domain of s, so maybe s is a complex variable? Hmm, the problem mentions &quot;the generating function of a sequence of binomially distributed random variables converges to the generating function of the Poisson distribution.&quot; So perhaps s is a real number in the context of probability generating functions, which are defined for |s| ≤ 1.

But maybe I can proceed without knowing exactly. Let&#x27;s suppose that s is such that |1 - (1 - s)c/n| &lt; 1 for all n sufficiently large. If (1 - s)c/n is positive and less than 1, then the term inside the absolute value is less than 1. But regardless, when raising to the power n, if the base is approaching 1 from below, then (1 - a/n)^n approaches e^{-a}. So perhaps the term (1 - (1 - s)c/n)^{n - 1} is bounded by some constant for all n.

But maybe instead of trying to bound the derivative directly, I can use an inequality for the difference of exponentials. Wait, but these are finite n terms. Alternatively, use the inequality |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}}. Is that a valid inequality?

Yes, because for any a and b, |aⁿ - bⁿ| = |a - b| |a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1}| ≤ |a - b| n max{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}}.

So maybe applying this with a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n and b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n.

Then, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n |a - b| max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Compute |a - b| = |(1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n) - (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)| = |(1 - s)(λ - λₙ)/n| = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n.

Therefore, |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ n * (|1 - s| |λₙ - λ| /n) * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} } = |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

So, the left-hand side of our original inequality is |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}.

Now, to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity. The term |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| tends to |1 - s| * 0 = 0. But what about the max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}}?

If we can show that max{|a|^{n - 1}, |b|^{n - 1}} is bounded as n → ∞, then the entire expression tends to zero. Let&#x27;s check |a|^{n - 1} and |b|^{n - 1}.

First, let&#x27;s recall that λₙ = n pₙ → λ, so for large n, λₙ is close to λ.

Compute a = 1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n. As n → ∞, (1 - s)λₙ/n ≈ (1 - s)λ/n → 0. So, a ≈ 1 - o(1)/n, so as n increases, a approaches 1. Similarly, b = 1 - (1 - s)λ/n also approaches 1.

Therefore, both |a| and |b| are approximately 1 - something small. The question is, when you raise such a term to the power n - 1, does it approach a finite limit?

Yes. For example, (1 - c/n)^n → e^{-c} as n → ∞. So, |a|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λₙ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λₙ} as n → ∞. Similarly, |b|^{n - 1} = |1 - (1 - s)λ/n|^{n - 1} ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ}.

Since λₙ → λ, both exponents approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}. Therefore, the max of these two terms would approach e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a finite number. Therefore, max{|a|^{n -1}, |b|^{n -1}} is bounded as n → ∞.

Therefore, the entire expression |aⁿ - bⁿ| ≤ |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| * C for some constant C. Since |λₙ - λ| → 0, the product tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the left-hand side is bounded above by zero (since the right-hand side limit is zero), and because absolute values are non-negative, the limit must be zero. Hence, the original inequality holds, and the limit is zero.

Alternatively, since the max term converges to e^{- (1 - s)λ}, which is a constant, and |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| goes to zero, then the product goes to zero. Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the left-hand side limit is zero.

Therefore, the generating functions converge because the difference between them goes to zero, which implies that the binomial distribution&#x27;s generating function converges to the Poisson generating function, which is e^{λ(s - 1)}. Because (1 - (1 - s)λ/n)^n ≈ e^{- (1 - s)λ} as n → ∞. Wait, actually, let me check that.

Wait, the generating function of a binomial distribution with parameters n and p is (1 - p + p s)^n = (1 + p(s - 1))^n. If we let p = λₙ /n, then it&#x27;s (1 + (λₙ /n)(s - 1))^n. As n → ∞, this tends to e^{λ(s - 1)}, which is the generating function of Poisson(λ). So, indeed, the convergence of the generating functions implies convergence in distribution, hence in probability as well.

But the problem mentions this is an application of the convergence theorem in probability, demonstrating that the generating function converges. So, the key step is showing that the difference between the generating functions goes to zero, which we did by bounding it with |1 - s| |λₙ - λ| times a bounded term, hence the limit is zero.

Therefore, the original inequality is proven, and the limit is zero.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

To show that the limit of the absolute difference between the two expressions is bounded by zero, we start by considering the function \( f(x) = \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^n \). We use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) to bound the difference \( |f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda)| \).

By MVT, there exists some \( c \) between \( \lambda_n \) and \( \lambda \) such that:
\[
f(\lambda_n) - f(\lambda) = f&#x27;(c)(\lambda_n - \lambda)
\]
The derivative \( f&#x27;(x) \) is calculated as:
\[
f&#x27;(x) = - (1 - s) \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n-1}
\]
Taking the absolute value, we get:
\[
|f&#x27;(c)| = |1 - s| \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right|^{n-1}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), \( \lambda_n \to \lambda \), so \( c \approx \lambda \). The term \( \left(1 - (1 - s)\frac{c}{n}\right)^{n-1} \) approximates \( e^{-(1 - s)c} \), which is bounded. 

Using the inequality for the difference of powers, we have:
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq n |a - b| \max\{|a|^{n-1}, |b|^{n-1}\}
\]
where \( a = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n} \) and \( b = 1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n} \). The difference \( |a - b| \) is:
\[
|a - b| = \left| (1 - s) \frac{\lambda - \lambda_n}{n} \right| = \frac{|1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda|}{n}
\]
Thus,
\[
|a^n - b^n| \leq |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \max\left\{\left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda_n}{n}\right|^{n-1}, \left|1 - (1 - s)\frac{\lambda}{n}\right|^{n-1}\right\}
\]
As \( n \to \infty \), the max term converges to \( e^{-(1 - s)\lambda} \), a constant. Since \( |\lambda_n - \lambda| \to 0 \), the product \( |1 - s| |\lambda_n - \lambda| \cdot C \) tends to zero.

Therefore, the limit of the absolute difference is bounded by zero, proving the result:
\[
\boxed{0}
