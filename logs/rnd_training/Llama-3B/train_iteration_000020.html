Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of the integral from 0 to pi of x times the absolute value of sin(2nx) dx. Hmm. Let me write that down properly to visualize it better.

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx \]

Okay, so the integral involves x multiplied by the absolute value of sin(2nx), and we need to find its limit as n becomes very large. First, I remember that integrals involving rapidly oscillating functions like sine or cosine can sometimes be simplified using methods like the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma or by considering the average value over the oscillations. But here, there&#x27;s an absolute value, which complicates things a bit because the absolute value of sine is a non-negative function with period pi/n instead of 2pi/n. Wait, let me check that.

The function sin(2nx) has a period of pi/n because the period of sin(kx) is 2pi/k, so here k is 2n, so period is 2pi/(2n) = pi/n. But when we take the absolute value, the period halves, so the period of |sin(2nx)| is pi/(2n). So each &quot;hill&quot; of the sine wave becomes a hump from 0 to pi/(2n), then another hump from pi/(2n) to pi/n, etc. So the function |sin(2nx)| oscillates very rapidly as n becomes large, with period pi/n. So the integral is over x from 0 to pi, multiplied by this oscillating function.

Now, since n is going to infinity, the oscillations are getting extremely rapid, so maybe we can use the concept of the average value of the function over each period. I recall that for a rapidly oscillating function, the integral can be approximated by integrating the function against the average value of the oscillating part. So perhaps the x term can be treated as a constant over each small interval of length pi/n, and then multiplied by the average of |sin(2nx)| over that interval.

Let me recall that the average value of |sin(u)| over one period pi (since the period of |sin(u)| is pi). The average value is (2/pi). Because the integral of |sin(u)| over 0 to pi is 2, so the average is 2/pi. Therefore, if we can replace |sin(2nx)| by its average value 2/pi, then the integral becomes the integral of x*(2/pi) dx from 0 to pi, and then take the limit as n goes to infinity. But wait, does that work here?

Wait, but the problem is that x is also varying over the interval [0, pi], so maybe we need to be more careful. Let me think. If the oscillations are very rapid, then over each small interval, x is approximately constant, and the integral over that interval can be approximated by x (constant) times the integral of |sin(2nx)| over that interval. Then, since the integral of |sin(2nx)| over each period pi/n is 2/(2n) * 2 = 2/(2n)? Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s do it more carefully.

Let me make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let’s set t = 2n x. Then when x goes from 0 to pi, t goes from 0 to 2n pi. Then dx = dt/(2n). So substituting into the integral, we get:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \frac{t}{2n} |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Wait, no, hold on. Let me check that substitution again. If t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), so dx = dt/(2n). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \left( \frac{t}{2n} \right) |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \]

So the original integral is equal to (1/(4n²)) times the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ. Then, we need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/(4n²)) times that integral. So the problem reduces to understanding the growth of the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ as n becomes large.

Now, let me analyze the integral I(n) = ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt. Let&#x27;s consider splitting this integral into a sum over each period of |sin t|. Since |sin t| has period π, the interval from 0 to 2nπ can be divided into 2n intervals each of length π. So:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} ∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt

But in each interval [kπ, (k+1)π], |sin t| = |sin(t - kπ)|, which is sin(t - kπ) when k is even and sin(t - kπ) when k is odd, but since it&#x27;s absolute value, it&#x27;s just sin(t&#x27;) where t&#x27; = t - kπ. So in each interval, we can substitute t = kπ + u, where u goes from 0 to π. Then:

∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt = ∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) |sin(kπ + u)| du

But |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u| because sin(kπ + u) = sin u if k is even (since sin(kπ + u) = sin u when k even) and sin(kπ + u) = sin(u + π) = -sin u when k is odd, but absolute value makes it |sin u| in either case. Therefore, |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u|. But since u is from 0 to π, |sin u| = sin u. Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) sin u du

So substituting back:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} [ kπ ∫_{0}^{\pi} \sin u du + ∫_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u du ]

Let me compute those two integrals separately. First, ∫₀^π sin u du = 2, since the integral of sin u is -cos u, evaluated from 0 to pi: -cos pi + cos 0 = -(-1) + 1 = 2. Second, ∫₀^π u sin u du. That integral can be computed via integration by parts. Let me do that.

Let u = t, dv = sin t dt. Then du = dt, v = -cos t. So:

∫ t sin t dt = -t cos t + ∫ cos t dt = -t cos t + sin t + C

Evaluated from 0 to pi:

[-pi cos pi + sin pi] - [0 + sin 0] = -pi*(-1) + 0 - 0 = pi

So ∫₀^π u sin u du = pi

Therefore, each term in the sum becomes:

kπ * 2 + pi = 2kπ + pi

Therefore, I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} (2kπ + pi) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 2kπ + Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} pi

Let&#x27;s compute the two sums separately.

First sum: 2π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} k = 2π * [ (2n - 1)(2n) ) / 2 ] = 2π * [ (4n² - 2n) / 2 ] = 2π * (2n² - n ) = 4π n² - 2π n

Second sum: π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 1 = π * 2n = 2π n

Therefore, I(n) = 4π n² - 2π n + 2π n = 4π n²

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. The -2π n and +2π n cancel out, so I(n) = 4π n².

So going back to the original expression, the integral we had was (1/(4n²)) * I(n) = (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π

Wait, so the integral simplifies to π, and since we&#x27;re taking the limit as n approaches infinity, the limit is π? But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, first, substitution t = 2n x, so x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{2nπ} (t/(2n)) |sin t| * (dt/(2n)) = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt

Which we called I(n). Then we split I(n) into 2n intervals of length pi each, substituted each integral, found that each contributes 2kπ + pi, summed over k from 0 to 2n - 1, which gave 4π n².

Therefore, (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π. Therefore, the integral evaluates to π for any n? But that can&#x27;t be, because when n increases, the integral is oscillating? Wait, but according to this calculation, regardless of n, the integral is exactly π. So the limit as n approaches infinity is π? Hmm, but that seems counterintuitive because if you have x multiplied by |sin(2nx)|, which is oscillating rapidly, but the average value of |sin(2nx)| is 2/pi, so integrating x*(2/pi) from 0 to pi would give (2/pi)*(pi²/2) = pi. So that&#x27;s the same result. So in fact, the integral is equal to pi for all n? Wait, that seems strange.

Wait, no, the substitution led us to I(n) = 4π n², so when we multiply by 1/(4n²), it cancels out, leaving π. So does that mean that the integral is exactly equal to pi for any n? That seems incorrect because if n is 1, let&#x27;s test n=1. Compute the integral from 0 to pi of x |sin(2x)| dx. Let me compute that numerically.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute ∫₀^π x |sin(2x)| dx when n=1. Let&#x27;s split the integral into intervals where sin(2x) is positive and negative. Since sin(2x) is positive in [0, pi/2] and negative in [pi/2, pi]. So |sin(2x)| = sin(2x) in [0, pi/2] and -sin(2x) in [pi/2, pi].

So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{pi/2} x sin(2x) dx + ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx

But let&#x27;s compute these two integrals. Let me compute the first one: ∫ x sin(2x) dx. Integration by parts. Let u = x, dv = sin(2x) dx. Then du = dx, v = -1/2 cos(2x).

So ∫ x sin(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/2) ∫ cos(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x) + C

Evaluate from 0 to pi/2:

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

At 0: -0 + 0 = 0

So the first integral is pi/4.

Second integral: ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx = - ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x sin(2x) dx

Again, integration by parts:

Same as before, integral of x sin(2x) dx is -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x)

Evaluate from pi/2 to pi:

At pi: -pi/2 cos(2pi) + (1/4) sin(2pi) = -pi/2 * 1 + 0 = -pi/2

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

Therefore, the integral is [ -pi/2 - pi/4 ] = -3pi/4, but multiplied by the negative sign outside:

- [ -3pi/4 ] = 3pi/4

Therefore, the second integral is 3pi/4

So total integral for n=1 is pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi. Which matches our previous result. So the integral is indeed pi when n=1. Wait, so does that mean that the integral is always pi, regardless of n? Let&#x27;s test n=2.

Wait, for n=2, the integral is ∫₀^pi x |sin(4x)| dx. Let me check if that&#x27;s pi as well.

Again, split into intervals where sin(4x) is positive and negative. The zeros of sin(4x) are at x = k pi /4, so between 0 and pi, the zeros are at 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi. So intervals: [0, pi/4], [pi/4, pi/2], [pi/2, 3pi/4], [3pi/4, pi]. The sign alternates each interval.

But computing this integral would be tedious, but according to our general formula, it should also equal pi. Let me see.

But perhaps there&#x27;s a pattern here. If the integral equals pi for n=1 and n=2, then maybe for all n, the integral is equal to pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi. But that seems counterintuitive at first, but maybe it&#x27;s correct.

Wait, the reasoning via substitution gave us that for any n, the integral equals pi. So even before taking the limit, the integral is pi. Therefore, the limit is pi.

But that seems surprising. Let me check with another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the average of |sin(2nx)| over the interval. Since |sin(2nx)| has average value 2/pi over each period. Then, if we can write the integral as ∫₀^pi x * |sin(2nx)| dx ≈ ∫₀^pi x * (2/pi) dx = (2/pi) * (pi² / 2) = pi. So that also gives pi.

But this is only an approximation when n is large, right? But according to the substitution method, it&#x27;s exact for any n. So maybe the integral is exactly pi for any n. But then why does the problem ask for the limit as n approaches infinity? If the integral is pi for all n, then the limit is pi. But maybe the problem is set in such a way that regardless of n, the integral is pi. Wait, but how is that possible?

Wait, when we did the substitution, we saw that the integral is exactly pi, regardless of n. So even when n is 1, 2, 3, etc., the integral is exactly pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is just pi. So the answer is pi.

But that seems too straightforward. Maybe the problem was designed to test if we realize that despite the oscillating function, the integral evaluates to the same value for any n. But why is that?

Let me verify for n=1/2. Wait, n is an integer going to infinity, but if we take n=1/2, which is not an integer, but just to see. Wait, no, n is a positive integer here. But in any case, the substitution works for any positive real n, but in the problem, n is approaching infinity through integer values. However, the key point is that the integral is always pi. So regardless of n, the integral is pi, so the limit is pi.

But that seems strange. Let me check n=1 case again. Wait, when n=1, the integral is pi. When n=2, the integral is pi. Wait, so is this a general result? For any integer n, ∫₀^pi x |sin(2n x)| dx = pi. How is that possible?

Wait, but if we make substitution t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). The integral becomes (1/(2n)) ∫₀^{2n pi} [t/(2n)] |sin t| dt = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2n pi} t |sin t| dt. Then, according to our previous calculation, that integral is 4 pi n², so (1/(4n²)) * 4 pi n² = pi. So yes, this shows that for any n, the integral equals pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi.

So the answer is pi. Therefore, the box answer is \boxed{\pi}

But let me just verify once more with n=1. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx, we saw earlier that it&#x27;s pi. Let me compute numerically for n=1. Let&#x27;s use approximate values.

The integral for n=1 was pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi, which is approximately 3.1416. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx numerically, say using trapezoidal rule with a few intervals, would I get roughly pi?

Let&#x27;s try. Divide [0, pi] into four intervals: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi.

Compute x |sin(2x)| at these points:

At 0: 0 * |0| = 0

At pi/4: (pi/4) * |sin(pi/2)| = (pi/4)*1 ≈ 0.7854

At pi/2: (pi/2)*|sin(pi)| = (pi/2)*0 = 0

At 3pi/4: (3pi/4)*|sin(3pi/2)| = (3pi/4)*1 ≈ 2.3562

At pi: pi * |sin(2pi)| = pi * 0 = 0

Using trapezoidal rule:

Approximate integral ≈ (pi/4)/2 [0 + 2*(0.7854) + 2*0 + 2*(2.3562) + 0] = (pi/8) [0 + 1.5708 + 0 + 4.7124 + 0] = (pi/8)*(6.2832) ≈ (pi/8)*(2pi) ≈ (pi^2)/4 ≈ 2.4674

But pi is approximately 3.1416, so this is a rough approximation. The trapezoidal rule with four intervals isn&#x27;t very accurate here because the function is oscillating. But if we take more intervals, it would approach pi. For example, if we take n=1 and compute the integral using more intervals, it should approach pi.

Alternatively, trust the analytical result which shows that the integral is exactly pi for any n. Therefore, the limit is pi.

Wait, this is fascinating. So the integral ∫₀^pi x |sin(2nx)| dx is equal to pi for any positive integer n, hence the limit as n approaches infinity is also pi. Therefore, the answer is pi. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\pi}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\pi}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\), we start by considering the integral involving the rapidly oscillating function \( |\sin(2nx)| \).

First, we make a substitution \( t = 2nx \), which transforms the integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx = \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt
\]

Next, we analyze the integral \( \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \). By splitting this integral into intervals of length \( \pi \), we recognize that each interval contributes:
\[
\int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du
\]

This integral can be decomposed and evaluated using integration by parts:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du = k\pi \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du + \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du
\]

The results of these integrals are:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du = \pi
\]

Summing these contributions over all intervals from \( k = 0 \) to \( 2n - 1 \), we find:
\[
\int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} (2k\pi + \pi) = 4\pi n^2
\]

Substituting back into the original integral, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{4n^2} \cdot 4\pi n^2 = \pi
\]

Thus, the integral \(\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\) evaluates to \(\pi\) for any \( n \). Therefore, the limit as \( n \to \infty \) is:
\[
\boxed{\pi}
\]          </p>

Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of the integral from 0 to pi of x times the absolute value of sin(2nx) dx. Hmm. Let me write that down properly to visualize it better.

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx \]

Okay, so the integral involves x multiplied by the absolute value of sin(2nx), and we need to find its limit as n becomes very large. First, I remember that integrals involving rapidly oscillating functions like sine or cosine can sometimes be simplified using methods like the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma or by considering the average value over the oscillations. But here, there&#x27;s an absolute value, which complicates things a bit because the absolute value of sine is a non-negative function with period pi/n instead of 2pi/n. Wait, let me check that.

The function sin(2nx) has a period of pi/n because the period of sin(kx) is 2pi/k, so here k is 2n, so period is 2pi/(2n) = pi/n. But when we take the absolute value, the period halves, so the period of |sin(2nx)| is pi/(2n). So each &quot;hill&quot; of the sine wave becomes a hump from 0 to pi/(2n), then another hump from pi/(2n) to pi/n, etc. So the function |sin(2nx)| oscillates very rapidly as n becomes large, with period pi/n. So the integral is over x from 0 to pi, multiplied by this oscillating function.

Now, since n is going to infinity, the oscillations are getting extremely rapid, so maybe we can use the concept of the average value of the function over each period. I recall that for a rapidly oscillating function, the integral can be approximated by integrating the function against the average value of the oscillating part. So perhaps the x term can be treated as a constant over each small interval of length pi/n, and then multiplied by the average of |sin(2nx)| over that interval.

Let me recall that the average value of |sin(u)| over one period pi (since the period of |sin(u)| is pi). The average value is (2/pi). Because the integral of |sin(u)| over 0 to pi is 2, so the average is 2/pi. Therefore, if we can replace |sin(2nx)| by its average value 2/pi, then the integral becomes the integral of x*(2/pi) dx from 0 to pi, and then take the limit as n goes to infinity. But wait, does that work here?

Wait, but the problem is that x is also varying over the interval [0, pi], so maybe we need to be more careful. Let me think. If the oscillations are very rapid, then over each small interval, x is approximately constant, and the integral over that interval can be approximated by x (constant) times the integral of |sin(2nx)| over that interval. Then, since the integral of |sin(2nx)| over each period pi/n is 2/(2n) * 2 = 2/(2n)? Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s do it more carefully.

Let me make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let’s set t = 2n x. Then when x goes from 0 to pi, t goes from 0 to 2n pi. Then dx = dt/(2n). So substituting into the integral, we get:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \frac{t}{2n} |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Wait, no, hold on. Let me check that substitution again. If t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), so dx = dt/(2n). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \left( \frac{t}{2n} \right) |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \]

So the original integral is equal to (1/(4n²)) times the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ. Then, we need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/(4n²)) times that integral. So the problem reduces to understanding the growth of the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ as n becomes large.

Now, let me analyze the integral I(n) = ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt. Let&#x27;s consider splitting this integral into a sum over each period of |sin t|. Since |sin t| has period π, the interval from 0 to 2nπ can be divided into 2n intervals each of length π. So:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} ∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt

But in each interval [kπ, (k+1)π], |sin t| = |sin(t - kπ)|, which is sin(t - kπ) when k is even and sin(t - kπ) when k is odd, but since it&#x27;s absolute value, it&#x27;s just sin(t&#x27;) where t&#x27; = t - kπ. So in each interval, we can substitute t = kπ + u, where u goes from 0 to π. Then:

∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt = ∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) |sin(kπ + u)| du

But |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u| because sin(kπ + u) = sin u if k is even (since sin(kπ + u) = sin u when k even) and sin(kπ + u) = sin(u + π) = -sin u when k is odd, but absolute value makes it |sin u| in either case. Therefore, |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u|. But since u is from 0 to π, |sin u| = sin u. Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) sin u du

So substituting back:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} [ kπ ∫_{0}^{\pi} \sin u du + ∫_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u du ]

Let me compute those two integrals separately. First, ∫₀^π sin u du = 2, since the integral of sin u is -cos u, evaluated from 0 to pi: -cos pi + cos 0 = -(-1) + 1 = 2. Second, ∫₀^π u sin u du. That integral can be computed via integration by parts. Let me do that.

Let u = t, dv = sin t dt. Then du = dt, v = -cos t. So:

∫ t sin t dt = -t cos t + ∫ cos t dt = -t cos t + sin t + C

Evaluated from 0 to pi:

[-pi cos pi + sin pi] - [0 + sin 0] = -pi*(-1) + 0 - 0 = pi

So ∫₀^π u sin u du = pi

Therefore, each term in the sum becomes:

kπ * 2 + pi = 2kπ + pi

Therefore, I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} (2kπ + pi) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 2kπ + Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} pi

Let&#x27;s compute the two sums separately.

First sum: 2π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} k = 2π * [ (2n - 1)(2n) ) / 2 ] = 2π * [ (4n² - 2n) / 2 ] = 2π * (2n² - n ) = 4π n² - 2π n

Second sum: π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 1 = π * 2n = 2π n

Therefore, I(n) = 4π n² - 2π n + 2π n = 4π n²

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. The -2π n and +2π n cancel out, so I(n) = 4π n².

So going back to the original expression, the integral we had was (1/(4n²)) * I(n) = (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π

Wait, so the integral simplifies to π, and since we&#x27;re taking the limit as n approaches infinity, the limit is π? But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, first, substitution t = 2n x, so x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{2nπ} (t/(2n)) |sin t| * (dt/(2n)) = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt

Which we called I(n). Then we split I(n) into 2n intervals of length pi each, substituted each integral, found that each contributes 2kπ + pi, summed over k from 0 to 2n - 1, which gave 4π n².

Therefore, (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π. Therefore, the integral evaluates to π for any n? But that can&#x27;t be, because when n increases, the integral is oscillating? Wait, but according to this calculation, regardless of n, the integral is exactly π. So the limit as n approaches infinity is π? Hmm, but that seems counterintuitive because if you have x multiplied by |sin(2nx)|, which is oscillating rapidly, but the average value of |sin(2nx)| is 2/pi, so integrating x*(2/pi) from 0 to pi would give (2/pi)*(pi²/2) = pi. So that&#x27;s the same result. So in fact, the integral is equal to pi for all n? Wait, that seems strange.

Wait, no, the substitution led us to I(n) = 4π n², so when we multiply by 1/(4n²), it cancels out, leaving π. So does that mean that the integral is exactly equal to pi for any n? That seems incorrect because if n is 1, let&#x27;s test n=1. Compute the integral from 0 to pi of x |sin(2x)| dx. Let me compute that numerically.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute ∫₀^π x |sin(2x)| dx when n=1. Let&#x27;s split the integral into intervals where sin(2x) is positive and negative. Since sin(2x) is positive in [0, pi/2] and negative in [pi/2, pi]. So |sin(2x)| = sin(2x) in [0, pi/2] and -sin(2x) in [pi/2, pi].

So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{pi/2} x sin(2x) dx + ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx

But let&#x27;s compute these two integrals. Let me compute the first one: ∫ x sin(2x) dx. Integration by parts. Let u = x, dv = sin(2x) dx. Then du = dx, v = -1/2 cos(2x).

So ∫ x sin(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/2) ∫ cos(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x) + C

Evaluate from 0 to pi/2:

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

At 0: -0 + 0 = 0

So the first integral is pi/4.

Second integral: ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx = - ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x sin(2x) dx

Again, integration by parts:

Same as before, integral of x sin(2x) dx is -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x)

Evaluate from pi/2 to pi:

At pi: -pi/2 cos(2pi) + (1/4) sin(2pi) = -pi/2 * 1 + 0 = -pi/2

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

Therefore, the integral is [ -pi/2 - pi/4 ] = -3pi/4, but multiplied by the negative sign outside:

- [ -3pi/4 ] = 3pi/4

Therefore, the second integral is 3pi/4

So total integral for n=1 is pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi. Which matches our previous result. So the integral is indeed pi when n=1. Wait, so does that mean that the integral is always pi, regardless of n? Let&#x27;s test n=2.

Wait, for n=2, the integral is ∫₀^pi x |sin(4x)| dx. Let me check if that&#x27;s pi as well.

Again, split into intervals where sin(4x) is positive and negative. The zeros of sin(4x) are at x = k pi /4, so between 0 and pi, the zeros are at 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi. So intervals: [0, pi/4], [pi/4, pi/2], [pi/2, 3pi/4], [3pi/4, pi]. The sign alternates each interval.

But computing this integral would be tedious, but according to our general formula, it should also equal pi. Let me see.

But perhaps there&#x27;s a pattern here. If the integral equals pi for n=1 and n=2, then maybe for all n, the integral is equal to pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi. But that seems counterintuitive at first, but maybe it&#x27;s correct.

Wait, the reasoning via substitution gave us that for any n, the integral equals pi. So even before taking the limit, the integral is pi. Therefore, the limit is pi.

But that seems surprising. Let me check with another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the average of |sin(2nx)| over the interval. Since |sin(2nx)| has average value 2/pi over each period. Then, if we can write the integral as ∫₀^pi x * |sin(2nx)| dx ≈ ∫₀^pi x * (2/pi) dx = (2/pi) * (pi² / 2) = pi. So that also gives pi.

But this is only an approximation when n is large, right? But according to the substitution method, it&#x27;s exact for any n. So maybe the integral is exactly pi for any n. But then why does the problem ask for the limit as n approaches infinity? If the integral is pi for all n, then the limit is pi. But maybe the problem is set in such a way that regardless of n, the integral is pi. Wait, but how is that possible?

Wait, when we did the substitution, we saw that the integral is exactly pi, regardless of n. So even when n is 1, 2, 3, etc., the integral is exactly pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is just pi. So the answer is pi.

But that seems too straightforward. Maybe the problem was designed to test if we realize that despite the oscillating function, the integral evaluates to the same value for any n. But why is that?

Let me verify for n=1/2. Wait, n is an integer going to infinity, but if we take n=1/2, which is not an integer, but just to see. Wait, no, n is a positive integer here. But in any case, the substitution works for any positive real n, but in the problem, n is approaching infinity through integer values. However, the key point is that the integral is always pi. So regardless of n, the integral is pi, so the limit is pi.

But that seems strange. Let me check n=1 case again. Wait, when n=1, the integral is pi. When n=2, the integral is pi. Wait, so is this a general result? For any integer n, ∫₀^pi x |sin(2n x)| dx = pi. How is that possible?

Wait, but if we make substitution t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). The integral becomes (1/(2n)) ∫₀^{2n pi} [t/(2n)] |sin t| dt = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2n pi} t |sin t| dt. Then, according to our previous calculation, that integral is 4 pi n², so (1/(4n²)) * 4 pi n² = pi. So yes, this shows that for any n, the integral equals pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi.

So the answer is pi. Therefore, the box answer is \boxed{\pi}

But let me just verify once more with n=1. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx, we saw earlier that it&#x27;s pi. Let me compute numerically for n=1. Let&#x27;s use approximate values.

The integral for n=1 was pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi, which is approximately 3.1416. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx numerically, say using trapezoidal rule with a few intervals, would I get roughly pi?

Let&#x27;s try. Divide [0, pi] into four intervals: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi.

Compute x |sin(2x)| at these points:

At 0: 0 * |0| = 0

At pi/4: (pi/4) * |sin(pi/2)| = (pi/4)*1 ≈ 0.7854

At pi/2: (pi/2)*|sin(pi)| = (pi/2)*0 = 0

At 3pi/4: (3pi/4)*|sin(3pi/2)| = (3pi/4)*1 ≈ 2.3562

At pi: pi * |sin(2pi)| = pi * 0 = 0

Using trapezoidal rule:

Approximate integral ≈ (pi/4)/2 [0 + 2*(0.7854) + 2*0 + 2*(2.3562) + 0] = (pi/8) [0 + 1.5708 + 0 + 4.7124 + 0] = (pi/8)*(6.2832) ≈ (pi/8)*(2pi) ≈ (pi^2)/4 ≈ 2.4674

But pi is approximately 3.1416, so this is a rough approximation. The trapezoidal rule with four intervals isn&#x27;t very accurate here because the function is oscillating. But if we take more intervals, it would approach pi. For example, if we take n=1 and compute the integral using more intervals, it should approach pi.

Alternatively, trust the analytical result which shows that the integral is exactly pi for any n. Therefore, the limit is pi.

Wait, this is fascinating. So the integral ∫₀^pi x |sin(2nx)| dx is equal to pi for any positive integer n, hence the limit as n approaches infinity is also pi. Therefore, the answer is pi. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\pi}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\pi}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\), we start by considering the integral involving the rapidly oscillating function \( |\sin(2nx)| \).

First, we make a substitution \( t = 2nx \), which transforms the integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx = \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt
\]

Next, we analyze the integral \( \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \). By splitting this integral into intervals of length \( \pi \), we recognize that each interval contributes:
\[
\int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du
\]

This integral can be decomposed and evaluated using integration by parts:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du = k\pi \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du + \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du
\]

The results of these integrals are:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du = \pi
\]

Summing these contributions over all intervals from \( k = 0 \) to \( 2n - 1 \), we find:
\[
\int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} (2k\pi + \pi) = 4\pi n^2
\]

Substituting back into the original integral, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{4n^2} \cdot 4\pi n^2 = \pi
\]

Thus, the integral \(\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\) evaluates to \(\pi\) for any \( n \). Therefore, the limit as \( n \to \infty \) is:
\[
\boxed{\pi}

Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of the integral from 0 to pi of x times the absolute value of sin(2nx) dx. Hmm. Let me write that down properly to visualize it better.

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx \]

Okay, so the integral involves x multiplied by the absolute value of sin(2nx), and we need to find its limit as n becomes very large. First, I remember that integrals involving rapidly oscillating functions like sine or cosine can sometimes be simplified using methods like the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma or by considering the average value over the oscillations. But here, there&#x27;s an absolute value, which complicates things a bit because the absolute value of sine is a non-negative function with period pi/n instead of 2pi/n. Wait, let me check that.

The function sin(2nx) has a period of pi/n because the period of sin(kx) is 2pi/k, so here k is 2n, so period is 2pi/(2n) = pi/n. But when we take the absolute value, the period halves, so the period of |sin(2nx)| is pi/(2n). So each &quot;hill&quot; of the sine wave becomes a hump from 0 to pi/(2n), then another hump from pi/(2n) to pi/n, etc. So the function |sin(2nx)| oscillates very rapidly as n becomes large, with period pi/n. So the integral is over x from 0 to pi, multiplied by this oscillating function.

Now, since n is going to infinity, the oscillations are getting extremely rapid, so maybe we can use the concept of the average value of the function over each period. I recall that for a rapidly oscillating function, the integral can be approximated by integrating the function against the average value of the oscillating part. So perhaps the x term can be treated as a constant over each small interval of length pi/n, and then multiplied by the average of |sin(2nx)| over that interval.

Let me recall that the average value of |sin(u)| over one period pi (since the period of |sin(u)| is pi). The average value is (2/pi). Because the integral of |sin(u)| over 0 to pi is 2, so the average is 2/pi. Therefore, if we can replace |sin(2nx)| by its average value 2/pi, then the integral becomes the integral of x*(2/pi) dx from 0 to pi, and then take the limit as n goes to infinity. But wait, does that work here?

Wait, but the problem is that x is also varying over the interval [0, pi], so maybe we need to be more careful. Let me think. If the oscillations are very rapid, then over each small interval, x is approximately constant, and the integral over that interval can be approximated by x (constant) times the integral of |sin(2nx)| over that interval. Then, since the integral of |sin(2nx)| over each period pi/n is 2/(2n) * 2 = 2/(2n)? Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s do it more carefully.

Let me make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let’s set t = 2n x. Then when x goes from 0 to pi, t goes from 0 to 2n pi. Then dx = dt/(2n). So substituting into the integral, we get:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \frac{t}{2n} |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Wait, no, hold on. Let me check that substitution again. If t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), so dx = dt/(2n). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \left( \frac{t}{2n} \right) |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \]

So the original integral is equal to (1/(4n²)) times the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ. Then, we need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/(4n²)) times that integral. So the problem reduces to understanding the growth of the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ as n becomes large.

Now, let me analyze the integral I(n) = ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt. Let&#x27;s consider splitting this integral into a sum over each period of |sin t|. Since |sin t| has period π, the interval from 0 to 2nπ can be divided into 2n intervals each of length π. So:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} ∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt

But in each interval [kπ, (k+1)π], |sin t| = |sin(t - kπ)|, which is sin(t - kπ) when k is even and sin(t - kπ) when k is odd, but since it&#x27;s absolute value, it&#x27;s just sin(t&#x27;) where t&#x27; = t - kπ. So in each interval, we can substitute t = kπ + u, where u goes from 0 to π. Then:

∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt = ∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) |sin(kπ + u)| du

But |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u| because sin(kπ + u) = sin u if k is even (since sin(kπ + u) = sin u when k even) and sin(kπ + u) = sin(u + π) = -sin u when k is odd, but absolute value makes it |sin u| in either case. Therefore, |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u|. But since u is from 0 to π, |sin u| = sin u. Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) sin u du

So substituting back:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} [ kπ ∫_{0}^{\pi} \sin u du + ∫_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u du ]

Let me compute those two integrals separately. First, ∫₀^π sin u du = 2, since the integral of sin u is -cos u, evaluated from 0 to pi: -cos pi + cos 0 = -(-1) + 1 = 2. Second, ∫₀^π u sin u du. That integral can be computed via integration by parts. Let me do that.

Let u = t, dv = sin t dt. Then du = dt, v = -cos t. So:

∫ t sin t dt = -t cos t + ∫ cos t dt = -t cos t + sin t + C

Evaluated from 0 to pi:

[-pi cos pi + sin pi] - [0 + sin 0] = -pi*(-1) + 0 - 0 = pi

So ∫₀^π u sin u du = pi

Therefore, each term in the sum becomes:

kπ * 2 + pi = 2kπ + pi

Therefore, I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} (2kπ + pi) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 2kπ + Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} pi

Let&#x27;s compute the two sums separately.

First sum: 2π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} k = 2π * [ (2n - 1)(2n) ) / 2 ] = 2π * [ (4n² - 2n) / 2 ] = 2π * (2n² - n ) = 4π n² - 2π n

Second sum: π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 1 = π * 2n = 2π n

Therefore, I(n) = 4π n² - 2π n + 2π n = 4π n²

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. The -2π n and +2π n cancel out, so I(n) = 4π n².

So going back to the original expression, the integral we had was (1/(4n²)) * I(n) = (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π

Wait, so the integral simplifies to π, and since we&#x27;re taking the limit as n approaches infinity, the limit is π? But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, first, substitution t = 2n x, so x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{2nπ} (t/(2n)) |sin t| * (dt/(2n)) = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt

Which we called I(n). Then we split I(n) into 2n intervals of length pi each, substituted each integral, found that each contributes 2kπ + pi, summed over k from 0 to 2n - 1, which gave 4π n².

Therefore, (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π. Therefore, the integral evaluates to π for any n? But that can&#x27;t be, because when n increases, the integral is oscillating? Wait, but according to this calculation, regardless of n, the integral is exactly π. So the limit as n approaches infinity is π? Hmm, but that seems counterintuitive because if you have x multiplied by |sin(2nx)|, which is oscillating rapidly, but the average value of |sin(2nx)| is 2/pi, so integrating x*(2/pi) from 0 to pi would give (2/pi)*(pi²/2) = pi. So that&#x27;s the same result. So in fact, the integral is equal to pi for all n? Wait, that seems strange.

Wait, no, the substitution led us to I(n) = 4π n², so when we multiply by 1/(4n²), it cancels out, leaving π. So does that mean that the integral is exactly equal to pi for any n? That seems incorrect because if n is 1, let&#x27;s test n=1. Compute the integral from 0 to pi of x |sin(2x)| dx. Let me compute that numerically.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute ∫₀^π x |sin(2x)| dx when n=1. Let&#x27;s split the integral into intervals where sin(2x) is positive and negative. Since sin(2x) is positive in [0, pi/2] and negative in [pi/2, pi]. So |sin(2x)| = sin(2x) in [0, pi/2] and -sin(2x) in [pi/2, pi].

So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{pi/2} x sin(2x) dx + ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx

But let&#x27;s compute these two integrals. Let me compute the first one: ∫ x sin(2x) dx. Integration by parts. Let u = x, dv = sin(2x) dx. Then du = dx, v = -1/2 cos(2x).

So ∫ x sin(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/2) ∫ cos(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x) + C

Evaluate from 0 to pi/2:

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

At 0: -0 + 0 = 0

So the first integral is pi/4.

Second integral: ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx = - ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x sin(2x) dx

Again, integration by parts:

Same as before, integral of x sin(2x) dx is -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x)

Evaluate from pi/2 to pi:

At pi: -pi/2 cos(2pi) + (1/4) sin(2pi) = -pi/2 * 1 + 0 = -pi/2

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

Therefore, the integral is [ -pi/2 - pi/4 ] = -3pi/4, but multiplied by the negative sign outside:

- [ -3pi/4 ] = 3pi/4

Therefore, the second integral is 3pi/4

So total integral for n=1 is pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi. Which matches our previous result. So the integral is indeed pi when n=1. Wait, so does that mean that the integral is always pi, regardless of n? Let&#x27;s test n=2.

Wait, for n=2, the integral is ∫₀^pi x |sin(4x)| dx. Let me check if that&#x27;s pi as well.

Again, split into intervals where sin(4x) is positive and negative. The zeros of sin(4x) are at x = k pi /4, so between 0 and pi, the zeros are at 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi. So intervals: [0, pi/4], [pi/4, pi/2], [pi/2, 3pi/4], [3pi/4, pi]. The sign alternates each interval.

But computing this integral would be tedious, but according to our general formula, it should also equal pi. Let me see.

But perhaps there&#x27;s a pattern here. If the integral equals pi for n=1 and n=2, then maybe for all n, the integral is equal to pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi. But that seems counterintuitive at first, but maybe it&#x27;s correct.

Wait, the reasoning via substitution gave us that for any n, the integral equals pi. So even before taking the limit, the integral is pi. Therefore, the limit is pi.

But that seems surprising. Let me check with another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the average of |sin(2nx)| over the interval. Since |sin(2nx)| has average value 2/pi over each period. Then, if we can write the integral as ∫₀^pi x * |sin(2nx)| dx ≈ ∫₀^pi x * (2/pi) dx = (2/pi) * (pi² / 2) = pi. So that also gives pi.

But this is only an approximation when n is large, right? But according to the substitution method, it&#x27;s exact for any n. So maybe the integral is exactly pi for any n. But then why does the problem ask for the limit as n approaches infinity? If the integral is pi for all n, then the limit is pi. But maybe the problem is set in such a way that regardless of n, the integral is pi. Wait, but how is that possible?

Wait, when we did the substitution, we saw that the integral is exactly pi, regardless of n. So even when n is 1, 2, 3, etc., the integral is exactly pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is just pi. So the answer is pi.

But that seems too straightforward. Maybe the problem was designed to test if we realize that despite the oscillating function, the integral evaluates to the same value for any n. But why is that?

Let me verify for n=1/2. Wait, n is an integer going to infinity, but if we take n=1/2, which is not an integer, but just to see. Wait, no, n is a positive integer here. But in any case, the substitution works for any positive real n, but in the problem, n is approaching infinity through integer values. However, the key point is that the integral is always pi. So regardless of n, the integral is pi, so the limit is pi.

But that seems strange. Let me check n=1 case again. Wait, when n=1, the integral is pi. When n=2, the integral is pi. Wait, so is this a general result? For any integer n, ∫₀^pi x |sin(2n x)| dx = pi. How is that possible?

Wait, but if we make substitution t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). The integral becomes (1/(2n)) ∫₀^{2n pi} [t/(2n)] |sin t| dt = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2n pi} t |sin t| dt. Then, according to our previous calculation, that integral is 4 pi n², so (1/(4n²)) * 4 pi n² = pi. So yes, this shows that for any n, the integral equals pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi.

So the answer is pi. Therefore, the box answer is \boxed{\pi}

But let me just verify once more with n=1. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx, we saw earlier that it&#x27;s pi. Let me compute numerically for n=1. Let&#x27;s use approximate values.

The integral for n=1 was pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi, which is approximately 3.1416. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx numerically, say using trapezoidal rule with a few intervals, would I get roughly pi?

Let&#x27;s try. Divide [0, pi] into four intervals: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi.

Compute x |sin(2x)| at these points:

At 0: 0 * |0| = 0

At pi/4: (pi/4) * |sin(pi/2)| = (pi/4)*1 ≈ 0.7854

At pi/2: (pi/2)*|sin(pi)| = (pi/2)*0 = 0

At 3pi/4: (3pi/4)*|sin(3pi/2)| = (3pi/4)*1 ≈ 2.3562

At pi: pi * |sin(2pi)| = pi * 0 = 0

Using trapezoidal rule:

Approximate integral ≈ (pi/4)/2 [0 + 2*(0.7854) + 2*0 + 2*(2.3562) + 0] = (pi/8) [0 + 1.5708 + 0 + 4.7124 + 0] = (pi/8)*(6.2832) ≈ (pi/8)*(2pi) ≈ (pi^2)/4 ≈ 2.4674

But pi is approximately 3.1416, so this is a rough approximation. The trapezoidal rule with four intervals isn&#x27;t very accurate here because the function is oscillating. But if we take more intervals, it would approach pi. For example, if we take n=1 and compute the integral using more intervals, it should approach pi.

Alternatively, trust the analytical result which shows that the integral is exactly pi for any n. Therefore, the limit is pi.

Wait, this is fascinating. So the integral ∫₀^pi x |sin(2nx)| dx is equal to pi for any positive integer n, hence the limit as n approaches infinity is also pi. Therefore, the answer is pi. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\pi}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\pi}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\), we start by considering the integral involving the rapidly oscillating function \( |\sin(2nx)| \).

First, we make a substitution \( t = 2nx \), which transforms the integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx = \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt
\]

Next, we analyze the integral \( \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \). By splitting this integral into intervals of length \( \pi \), we recognize that each interval contributes:
\[
\int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du
\]

This integral can be decomposed and evaluated using integration by parts:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du = k\pi \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du + \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du
\]

The results of these integrals are:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du = \pi
\]

Summing these contributions over all intervals from \( k = 0 \) to \( 2n - 1 \), we find:
\[
\int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} (2k\pi + \pi) = 4\pi n^2
\]

Substituting back into the original integral, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{4n^2} \cdot 4\pi n^2 = \pi
\]

Thus, the integral \(\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\) evaluates to \(\pi\) for any \( n \). Therefore, the limit as \( n \to \infty \) is:
\[
\boxed{\pi}

Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of the integral from 0 to pi of x times the absolute value of sin(2nx) dx. Hmm. Let me write that down properly to visualize it better.

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx \]

Okay, so the integral involves x multiplied by the absolute value of sin(2nx), and we need to find its limit as n becomes very large. First, I remember that integrals involving rapidly oscillating functions like sine or cosine can sometimes be simplified using methods like the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma or by considering the average value over the oscillations. But here, there&#x27;s an absolute value, which complicates things a bit because the absolute value of sine is a non-negative function with period pi/n instead of 2pi/n. Wait, let me check that.

The function sin(2nx) has a period of pi/n because the period of sin(kx) is 2pi/k, so here k is 2n, so period is 2pi/(2n) = pi/n. But when we take the absolute value, the period halves, so the period of |sin(2nx)| is pi/(2n). So each &quot;hill&quot; of the sine wave becomes a hump from 0 to pi/(2n), then another hump from pi/(2n) to pi/n, etc. So the function |sin(2nx)| oscillates very rapidly as n becomes large, with period pi/n. So the integral is over x from 0 to pi, multiplied by this oscillating function.

Now, since n is going to infinity, the oscillations are getting extremely rapid, so maybe we can use the concept of the average value of the function over each period. I recall that for a rapidly oscillating function, the integral can be approximated by integrating the function against the average value of the oscillating part. So perhaps the x term can be treated as a constant over each small interval of length pi/n, and then multiplied by the average of |sin(2nx)| over that interval.

Let me recall that the average value of |sin(u)| over one period pi (since the period of |sin(u)| is pi). The average value is (2/pi). Because the integral of |sin(u)| over 0 to pi is 2, so the average is 2/pi. Therefore, if we can replace |sin(2nx)| by its average value 2/pi, then the integral becomes the integral of x*(2/pi) dx from 0 to pi, and then take the limit as n goes to infinity. But wait, does that work here?

Wait, but the problem is that x is also varying over the interval [0, pi], so maybe we need to be more careful. Let me think. If the oscillations are very rapid, then over each small interval, x is approximately constant, and the integral over that interval can be approximated by x (constant) times the integral of |sin(2nx)| over that interval. Then, since the integral of |sin(2nx)| over each period pi/n is 2/(2n) * 2 = 2/(2n)? Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s do it more carefully.

Let me make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let’s set t = 2n x. Then when x goes from 0 to pi, t goes from 0 to 2n pi. Then dx = dt/(2n). So substituting into the integral, we get:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \frac{t}{2n} |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Wait, no, hold on. Let me check that substitution again. If t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), so dx = dt/(2n). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \left( \frac{t}{2n} \right) |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \]

So the original integral is equal to (1/(4n²)) times the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ. Then, we need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/(4n²)) times that integral. So the problem reduces to understanding the growth of the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ as n becomes large.

Now, let me analyze the integral I(n) = ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt. Let&#x27;s consider splitting this integral into a sum over each period of |sin t|. Since |sin t| has period π, the interval from 0 to 2nπ can be divided into 2n intervals each of length π. So:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} ∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt

But in each interval [kπ, (k+1)π], |sin t| = |sin(t - kπ)|, which is sin(t - kπ) when k is even and sin(t - kπ) when k is odd, but since it&#x27;s absolute value, it&#x27;s just sin(t&#x27;) where t&#x27; = t - kπ. So in each interval, we can substitute t = kπ + u, where u goes from 0 to π. Then:

∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt = ∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) |sin(kπ + u)| du

But |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u| because sin(kπ + u) = sin u if k is even (since sin(kπ + u) = sin u when k even) and sin(kπ + u) = sin(u + π) = -sin u when k is odd, but absolute value makes it |sin u| in either case. Therefore, |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u|. But since u is from 0 to π, |sin u| = sin u. Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) sin u du

So substituting back:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} [ kπ ∫_{0}^{\pi} \sin u du + ∫_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u du ]

Let me compute those two integrals separately. First, ∫₀^π sin u du = 2, since the integral of sin u is -cos u, evaluated from 0 to pi: -cos pi + cos 0 = -(-1) + 1 = 2. Second, ∫₀^π u sin u du. That integral can be computed via integration by parts. Let me do that.

Let u = t, dv = sin t dt. Then du = dt, v = -cos t. So:

∫ t sin t dt = -t cos t + ∫ cos t dt = -t cos t + sin t + C

Evaluated from 0 to pi:

[-pi cos pi + sin pi] - [0 + sin 0] = -pi*(-1) + 0 - 0 = pi

So ∫₀^π u sin u du = pi

Therefore, each term in the sum becomes:

kπ * 2 + pi = 2kπ + pi

Therefore, I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} (2kπ + pi) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 2kπ + Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} pi

Let&#x27;s compute the two sums separately.

First sum: 2π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} k = 2π * [ (2n - 1)(2n) ) / 2 ] = 2π * [ (4n² - 2n) / 2 ] = 2π * (2n² - n ) = 4π n² - 2π n

Second sum: π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 1 = π * 2n = 2π n

Therefore, I(n) = 4π n² - 2π n + 2π n = 4π n²

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. The -2π n and +2π n cancel out, so I(n) = 4π n².

So going back to the original expression, the integral we had was (1/(4n²)) * I(n) = (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π

Wait, so the integral simplifies to π, and since we&#x27;re taking the limit as n approaches infinity, the limit is π? But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, first, substitution t = 2n x, so x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{2nπ} (t/(2n)) |sin t| * (dt/(2n)) = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt

Which we called I(n). Then we split I(n) into 2n intervals of length pi each, substituted each integral, found that each contributes 2kπ + pi, summed over k from 0 to 2n - 1, which gave 4π n².

Therefore, (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π. Therefore, the integral evaluates to π for any n? But that can&#x27;t be, because when n increases, the integral is oscillating? Wait, but according to this calculation, regardless of n, the integral is exactly π. So the limit as n approaches infinity is π? Hmm, but that seems counterintuitive because if you have x multiplied by |sin(2nx)|, which is oscillating rapidly, but the average value of |sin(2nx)| is 2/pi, so integrating x*(2/pi) from 0 to pi would give (2/pi)*(pi²/2) = pi. So that&#x27;s the same result. So in fact, the integral is equal to pi for all n? Wait, that seems strange.

Wait, no, the substitution led us to I(n) = 4π n², so when we multiply by 1/(4n²), it cancels out, leaving π. So does that mean that the integral is exactly equal to pi for any n? That seems incorrect because if n is 1, let&#x27;s test n=1. Compute the integral from 0 to pi of x |sin(2x)| dx. Let me compute that numerically.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute ∫₀^π x |sin(2x)| dx when n=1. Let&#x27;s split the integral into intervals where sin(2x) is positive and negative. Since sin(2x) is positive in [0, pi/2] and negative in [pi/2, pi]. So |sin(2x)| = sin(2x) in [0, pi/2] and -sin(2x) in [pi/2, pi].

So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{pi/2} x sin(2x) dx + ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx

But let&#x27;s compute these two integrals. Let me compute the first one: ∫ x sin(2x) dx. Integration by parts. Let u = x, dv = sin(2x) dx. Then du = dx, v = -1/2 cos(2x).

So ∫ x sin(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/2) ∫ cos(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x) + C

Evaluate from 0 to pi/2:

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

At 0: -0 + 0 = 0

So the first integral is pi/4.

Second integral: ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx = - ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x sin(2x) dx

Again, integration by parts:

Same as before, integral of x sin(2x) dx is -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x)

Evaluate from pi/2 to pi:

At pi: -pi/2 cos(2pi) + (1/4) sin(2pi) = -pi/2 * 1 + 0 = -pi/2

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

Therefore, the integral is [ -pi/2 - pi/4 ] = -3pi/4, but multiplied by the negative sign outside:

- [ -3pi/4 ] = 3pi/4

Therefore, the second integral is 3pi/4

So total integral for n=1 is pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi. Which matches our previous result. So the integral is indeed pi when n=1. Wait, so does that mean that the integral is always pi, regardless of n? Let&#x27;s test n=2.

Wait, for n=2, the integral is ∫₀^pi x |sin(4x)| dx. Let me check if that&#x27;s pi as well.

Again, split into intervals where sin(4x) is positive and negative. The zeros of sin(4x) are at x = k pi /4, so between 0 and pi, the zeros are at 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi. So intervals: [0, pi/4], [pi/4, pi/2], [pi/2, 3pi/4], [3pi/4, pi]. The sign alternates each interval.

But computing this integral would be tedious, but according to our general formula, it should also equal pi. Let me see.

But perhaps there&#x27;s a pattern here. If the integral equals pi for n=1 and n=2, then maybe for all n, the integral is equal to pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi. But that seems counterintuitive at first, but maybe it&#x27;s correct.

Wait, the reasoning via substitution gave us that for any n, the integral equals pi. So even before taking the limit, the integral is pi. Therefore, the limit is pi.

But that seems surprising. Let me check with another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the average of |sin(2nx)| over the interval. Since |sin(2nx)| has average value 2/pi over each period. Then, if we can write the integral as ∫₀^pi x * |sin(2nx)| dx ≈ ∫₀^pi x * (2/pi) dx = (2/pi) * (pi² / 2) = pi. So that also gives pi.

But this is only an approximation when n is large, right? But according to the substitution method, it&#x27;s exact for any n. So maybe the integral is exactly pi for any n. But then why does the problem ask for the limit as n approaches infinity? If the integral is pi for all n, then the limit is pi.

But in any case, the substitution works for any positive real n, but in the problem, n is approaching infinity through integer values. However, the key point is that the integral is always pi. So regardless of n, the integral is pi, so the limit is pi.

But that seems strange. Let me check n=1 case again. Wait, when n=1, the integral is pi. When n=2, the integral is pi. Wait, so is this a general result? For any integer n, ∫₀^pi x |sin(2n x)| dx = pi. How is that possible?

Wait, but if we make substitution t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). The integral becomes (1/(2n)) ∫₀^{2n pi} [t/(2n)] |sin t| dt = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2n pi} t |sin t| dt. Then, according to our previous calculation, that integral is 4 pi n², so (1/(4n²)) * 4 pi n² = pi. So yes, this shows that for any n, the integral equals pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi.

So the answer is pi. Therefore, the box answer is \boxed{\pi}

But let me just verify once more with n=1. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx, we saw earlier that it&#x27;s pi. Let me compute numerically for n=1. Let&#x27;s use approximate values.

Compute x |sin(2x)| at these points:

At 0: 0 * |0| = 0

At pi/4: (pi/4) * |sin(pi/2)| = (pi/4)*1 ≈ 0.7854

At pi/2: (pi/2)*|sin(pi)| = (pi/2)*0 = 0

At 3pi/4: (3pi/4)*|sin(3pi/2)| = (3pi/4)*1 ≈ 2.3562

At pi: pi * |sin(2pi)| = pi * 0 = 0

Using trapezoidal rule:

Approximate integral ≈ (pi/4)/2 [0 + 2*(0.7854) + 2*0 + 2*(2.3562) + 0] = (pi/8) [0 + 1.5708 + 0 + 4.7124 + 0] = (pi/8)*(6.2832) ≈ (pi/8)*(2pi) ≈ (pi^2)/4 ≈ 2.4674

But pi is approximately 3.1416, so this is a rough approximation. The trapezoidal rule with four intervals isn&#x27;t very accurate here because the function is oscillating. But if we take more intervals, it would approach pi. For example, if we take n=1 and compute the integral using more intervals, it should approach pi.

Alternatively, trust the analytical result which shows that the integral is exactly pi for any n. Therefore, the limit is pi.

Wait, this is fascinating. So the integral ∫₀^pi x |sin(2nx)| dx is equal to pi for any positive integer n, hence the limit as n approaches infinity is also pi. Therefore, the answer is pi. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\pi}

&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\), we start by considering the integral involving the rapidly oscillating function \( |\sin(2nx)| \).

First, we make a substitution \( t = 2nx \), which transforms the integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx = \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt
\]

Next, we analyze the integral \( \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \). By splitting this integral into intervals of length \( \pi \), we recognize that each interval contributes:
\[
\int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du
\]

This integral can be decomposed and evaluated using integration by parts:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du = k\pi \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du + \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du
\]

The results of these integrals are:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du = \pi
\]

Summing these contributions over all intervals from \( k = 0 \) to \( 2n - 1 \), we find:
\[
\int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} (2k\pi + \pi) = 4\pi n^2
\]

Substituting back into the original integral, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{4n^2} \cdot 4\pi n^2 = \pi
\]

Thus, the integral \(\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\) evaluates to \(\pi\) for any \( n \). Therefore, the limit as \( n \to \infty \) is:
\[
\boxed{\pi}

Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of the integral from 0 to pi of x times the absolute value of sin(2nx) dx. Hmm. Let me write that down properly to visualize it better.

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx \]

Okay, so the integral involves x multiplied by the absolute value of sin(2nx), and we need to find its limit as n becomes very large. First, I remember that integrals involving rapidly oscillating functions like sine or cosine can sometimes be simplified using methods like the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma or by considering the average value over the oscillations. But here, there&#x27;s an absolute value, which complicates things a bit because the absolute value of sine is a non-negative function with period pi/n instead of 2pi/n. Wait, let me check that.

The function sin(2nx) has a period of pi/n because the period of sin(kx) is 2pi/k, so here k is 2n, so period is 2pi/(2n) = pi/n. But when we take the absolute value, the period halves, so the period of |sin(2nx)| is pi/(2n). So each &quot;hill&quot; of the sine wave becomes a hump from 0 to pi/(2n), then another hump from pi/(2n) to pi/n, etc. So the function |sin(2nx)| oscillates very rapidly as n becomes large, with period pi/n. So the integral is over x from 0 to pi, multiplied by this oscillating function.

Now, since n is going to infinity, the oscillations are getting extremely rapid, so maybe we can use the concept of the average value of the function over each period. I recall that for a rapidly oscillating function, the integral can be approximated by integrating the function against the average value of the oscillating part. So perhaps the x term can be treated as a constant over each small interval of length pi/n, and then multiplied by the average of |sin(2nx)| over that interval.

Let me recall that the average value of |sin(u)| over one period pi (since the period of |sin(u)| is pi). The average value is (2/pi). Because the integral of |sin(u)| over 0 to pi is 2, so the average is 2/pi. Therefore, if we can replace |sin(2nx)| by its average value 2/pi, then the integral becomes the integral of x*(2/pi) dx from 0 to pi, and then take the limit as n goes to infinity. But wait, does that work here?

Wait, but the problem is that x is also varying over the interval [0, pi], so maybe we need to be more careful. Let me think. If the oscillations are very rapid, then over each small interval, x is approximately constant, and the integral over that interval can be approximated by x (constant) times the integral of |sin(2nx)| over that interval. Then, since the integral of |sin(2nx)| over each period pi/n is 2/(2n) * 2 = 2/(2n)? Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s do it more carefully.

Let me make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let’s set t = 2n x. Then when x goes from 0 to pi, t goes from 0 to 2n pi. Then dx = dt/(2n). So substituting into the integral, we get:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \frac{t}{2n} |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Wait, no, hold on. Let me check that substitution again. If t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), so dx = dt/(2n). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \left( \frac{t}{2n} \right) |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \]

So the original integral is equal to (1/(4n²)) times the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ. Then, we need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/(4n²)) times that integral. So the problem reduces to understanding the growth of the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ as n becomes large.

Now, let me analyze the integral I(n) = ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt. Let&#x27;s consider splitting this integral into a sum over each period of |sin t|. Since |sin t| has period π, the interval from 0 to 2nπ can be divided into 2n intervals each of length π. So:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} ∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt

But in each interval [kπ, (k+1)π], |sin t| = |sin(t - kπ)|, which is sin(t - kπ) when k is even and sin(t - kπ) when k is odd, but since it&#x27;s absolute value, it&#x27;s just sin(t&#x27;) where t&#x27; = t - kπ. So in each interval, we can substitute t = kπ + u, where u goes from 0 to π. Then:

∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt = ∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) |sin(kπ + u)| du

But |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u| because sin(kπ + u) = sin u if k is even (since sin(kπ + u) = sin u when k even) and sin(kπ + u) = sin(u + π) = -sin u when k is odd, but absolute value makes it |sin u| in either case. Therefore, |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u|. But since u is from 0 to π, |sin u| = sin u. Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) sin u du

So substituting back:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} [ kπ ∫_{0}^{\pi} \sin u du + ∫_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u du ]

Let me compute those two integrals separately. First, ∫₀^π sin u du = 2, since the integral of sin u is -cos u, evaluated from 0 to pi: -cos pi + cos 0 = -(-1) + 1 = 2. Second, ∫₀^π u sin u du. That integral can be computed via integration by parts. Let me do that.

Let u = t, dv = sin t dt. Then du = dt, v = -cos t. So:

∫ t sin t dt = -t cos t + ∫ cos t dt = -t cos t + sin t + C

Evaluated from 0 to pi:

[-pi cos pi + sin pi] - [0 + sin 0] = -pi*(-1) + 0 - 0 = pi

So ∫₀^π u sin u du = pi

Therefore, each term in the sum becomes:

kπ * 2 + pi = 2kπ + pi

Therefore, I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} (2kπ + pi) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 2kπ + Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} pi

Let&#x27;s compute the two sums separately.

First sum: 2π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} k = 2π * [ (2n - 1)(2n) ) / 2 ] = 2π * [ (4n² - 2n) / 2 ] = 2π * (2n² - n ) = 4π n² - 2π n

Second sum: π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 1 = π * 2n = 2π n

Therefore, I(n) = 4π n² - 2π n + 2π n = 4π n²

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. The -2π n and +2π n cancel out, so I(n) = 4π n².

So going back to the original expression, the integral we had was (1/(4n²)) * I(n) = (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π

Wait, so the integral simplifies to π, and since we&#x27;re taking the limit as n approaches infinity, the limit is π? But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, first, substitution t = 2n x, so x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{2nπ} (t/(2n)) |sin t| * (dt/(2n)) = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt

Which we called I(n). Then we split I(n) into 2n intervals of length pi each, substituted each integral, found that each contributes 2kπ + pi, summed over k from 0 to 2n - 1, which gave 4π n².

Therefore, (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π. Therefore, the integral evaluates to π for any n? But that can&#x27;t be, because when n increases, the integral is oscillating? Wait, but according to this calculation, regardless of n, the integral is exactly π. So the limit as n approaches infinity is π? Hmm, but that seems counterintuitive because if you have x multiplied by |sin(2nx)|, which is oscillating rapidly, but the average value of |sin(2nx)| is 2/pi, so integrating x*(2/pi) from 0 to pi would give (2/pi)*(pi²/2) = pi. So that&#x27;s the same result. So in fact, the integral is equal to pi for all n? Wait, that seems strange.

Wait, no, the substitution led us to I(n) = 4π n², so when we multiply by 1/(4n²), it cancels out, leaving π. So does that mean that the integral is exactly equal to pi for any n? That seems incorrect because if n is 1, let&#x27;s test n=1. Compute the integral from 0 to pi of x |sin(2x)| dx. Let me compute that numerically.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute ∫₀^π x |sin(2x)| dx when n=1. Let&#x27;s split the integral into intervals where sin(2x) is positive and negative. Since sin(2x) is positive in [0, pi/2] and negative in [pi/2, pi]. So |sin(2x)| = sin(2x) in [0, pi/2] and -sin(2x) in [pi/2, pi].

So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{pi/2} x sin(2x) dx + ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx

But let&#x27;s compute these two integrals. Let me compute the first one: ∫ x sin(2x) dx. Integration by parts. Let u = x, dv = sin(2x) dx. Then du = dx, v = -1/2 cos(2x).

So ∫ x sin(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/2) ∫ cos(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x) + C

Evaluate from 0 to pi/2:

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

At 0: -0 + 0 = 0

So the first integral is pi/4.

Second integral: ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx = - ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x sin(2x) dx

Again, integration by parts:

Same as before, integral of x sin(2x) dx is -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x)

Evaluate from pi/2 to pi:

At pi: -pi/2 cos(2pi) + (1/4) sin(2pi) = -pi/2 * 1 + 0 = -pi/2

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

Therefore, the integral is [ -pi/2 - pi/4 ] = -3pi/4, but multiplied by the negative sign outside:

- [ -3pi/4 ] = 3pi/4

Therefore, the second integral is 3pi/4

So total integral for n=1 is pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi. Which matches our previous result. So the integral is indeed pi when n=1. Wait, so does that mean that the integral is always pi, regardless of n? Let&#x27;s test n=2.

Wait, for n=2, the integral is ∫₀^pi x |sin(4x)| dx. Let me check if that&#x27;s pi as well.

Again, split into intervals where sin(4x) is positive and negative. The zeros of sin(4x) are at x = k pi /4, so between 0 and pi, the zeros are at 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi. So intervals: [0, pi/4], [pi/4, pi/2], [pi/2, 3pi/4], [3pi/4, pi]. The sign alternates each interval.

But computing this integral would be tedious, but according to our general formula, it should also equal pi. Let me see.

But perhaps there&#x27;s a pattern here. If the integral equals pi for n=1 and n=2, then maybe for all n, the integral is equal to pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi. But that seems counterintuitive at first, but maybe it&#x27;s correct.

Wait, the reasoning via substitution gave us that for any n, the integral equals pi. So even before taking the limit, the integral is pi. Therefore, the limit is pi.

But that seems surprising. Let me check with another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the average of |sin(2nx)| over the interval. Since |sin(2nx)| has average value 2/pi over each period. Then, if we can write the integral as ∫₀^pi x * |sin(2nx)| dx ≈ ∫₀^pi x * (2/pi) dx = (2/pi) * (pi² / 2) = pi. So that also gives pi.

But this is only an approximation when n is large, right? But according to the substitution method, it&#x27;s exact for any n. So maybe the integral is exactly pi for any n. But then why does the problem ask for the limit as n approaches infinity? If the integral is pi for all n, then the limit is pi. But maybe the problem is set in such a way that regardless of n, the integral is pi. Wait, but how is that possible?

Wait, when we did the substitution, we saw that the integral is exactly pi, regardless of n. So even when n is 1, 2, 3, etc., the integral is exactly pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is just pi. So the answer is pi.

But that seems too straightforward. Maybe the problem was designed to test if we realize that despite the oscillating function, the integral evaluates to the same value for any n. But why is that?

Let me verify for n=1/2. Wait, n is an integer going to infinity, but if we take n=1/2, which is not an integer, but just to see. Wait, no, n is a positive integer here. But in any case, the substitution works for any positive real n, but in the problem, n is approaching infinity through integer values. However, the key point is that the integral is always pi. So regardless of n, the integral is pi, so the limit is pi.

But that seems strange. Let me check n=1 case again. Wait, when n=1, the integral is pi. When n=2, the integral is pi. Wait, so is this a general result? For any integer n, ∫₀^pi x |sin(2n x)| dx = pi. How is that possible?

Wait, but if we make substitution t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). The integral becomes (1/(2n)) ∫₀^{2n pi} [t/(2n)] |sin t| dt = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2n pi} t |sin t| dt. Then, according to our previous calculation, that integral is 4 pi n², so (1/(4n²)) * 4 pi n² = pi. So yes, this shows that for any n, the integral equals pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi.

So the answer is pi. Therefore, the box answer is \boxed{\pi}

But let me just verify once more with n=1. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx, we saw earlier that it&#x27;s pi. Let me compute numerically for n=1. Let&#x27;s use approximate values.

The integral for n=1 was pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi, which is approximately 3.1416. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx numerically, say using trapezoidal rule with a few intervals, would I get roughly pi?

Let&#x27;s try. Divide [0, pi] into four intervals: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi.

Compute x |sin(2x)| at these points:

At 0: 0 * |0| = 0

At pi/4: (pi/4) * |sin(pi/2)| = (pi/4)*1 ≈ 0.7854

At pi/2: (pi/2)*|sin(pi)| = (pi/2)*0 = 0

At 3pi/4: (3pi/4)*|sin(3pi/2)| = (3pi/4)*1 ≈ 2.3562

At pi: pi * |sin(2pi)| = pi * 0 = 0

Using trapezoidal rule:

Approximate integral ≈ (pi/4)/2 [0 + 2*(0.7854) + 2*0 + 2*(2.3562) + 0] = (pi/8) [0 + 1.5708 + 0 + 4.7124 + 0] = (pi/8)*(6.2832) ≈ (pi/8)*(2pi) ≈ (pi^2)/4 ≈ 2.4674

But pi is approximately 3.1416, so this is a rough approximation. The trapezoidal rule with four intervals isn&#x27;t very accurate here because the function is oscillating. But if we take more intervals, it would approach pi. For example, if we take n=1 and compute the integral using more intervals, it should approach pi.

Alternatively, trust the analytical result which shows that the integral is exactly pi for any n. Therefore, the limit is pi.

Wait, this is fascinating. So the integral ∫₀^pi x |sin(2nx)| dx is equal to pi for any positive integer n, hence the limit as n approaches infinity is also pi. Therefore, the answer is pi. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\pi}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\pi}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\), we start by considering the integral involving the rapidly oscillating function \( |\sin(2nx)| \).

First, we make a substitution \( t = 2nx \), which transforms the integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx = \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt
\]

Next, we analyze the integral \( \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \). By splitting this integral into intervals of length \( \pi \), we recognize that each interval contributes:
\[
\int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du
\]

This integral can be decomposed and evaluated using integration by parts:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du = k\pi \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du + \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du
\]

The results of these integrals are:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du = \pi
\]

Summing these contributions over all intervals from \( k = 0 \) to \( 2n - 1 \), we find:
\[
\int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} (2k\pi + \pi) = 4\pi n^2
\]

Substituting back into the original integral, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{4n^2} \cdot 4\pi n^2 = \pi
\]

Thus, the integral \(\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\) evaluates to \(\pi\) for any \( n \). Therefore, the limit as \( n \to \infty \) is:
\[
\boxed{\pi}

Okay, so the integral involves x multiplied by the absolute value of sin(2nx), and we need to find its limit as n becomes very large. First, I remember that integrals involving rapidly oscillating functions like sine or cosine can sometimes be simplified using methods like the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma or by considering the average value over the oscillations. But here, there&#x27;s an absolute value, which complicates things a bit because the absolute value of sine is a non-negative function with period pi/n instead of 2pi/n. Wait, let me check that.

The function sin(2nx) has a period of pi/n because the period of sin(kx) is 2pi/k, so here k is 2n, so period is 2pi/(2n) = pi/n. But when we take the absolute value, the period halves, so the period of |sin(2nx)| is pi/(2n). So each &quot;hill&quot; of the sine wave becomes a hump from 0 to pi/(2n), then another hump from pi/(2n) to pi/n, etc. So the function |sin(2nx)| oscillates very rapidly as n becomes large, with period pi/n. So the integral is over x from 0 to pi, multiplied by this oscillating function.

Now, since n is going to infinity, the oscillations are getting extremely rapid, so maybe we can use the concept of the average value of the function over each period. I recall that for a rapidly oscillating function, the integral can be approximated by integrating the function against the average value of the oscillating part. So perhaps the x term can be treated as a constant over each small interval of length pi/n, and then multiplied by the average of |sin(2nx)| over that interval.

Let me recall that the average value of |sin(u)| over one period pi (since the period of |sin(u)| is pi). The average value is (2/pi). Because the integral of |sin(u)| over 0 to pi is 2, so the average is 2/pi. Therefore, if we can replace |sin(2nx)| by its average value 2/pi, then the integral becomes the integral of x*(2/pi) dx from 0 to pi, and then take the limit as n goes to infinity. But wait, does that work here?

Wait, but the problem is that x is also varying over the interval [0, pi], so maybe we need to be more careful. Let me think. If the oscillations are very rapid, then over each small interval, x is approximately constant, and the integral over that interval can be approximated by x (constant) times the integral of |sin(2nx)| over that interval. Then, since the integral of |sin(2nx)| over each period pi/n is 2/(2n) * 2 = 2/(2n)? Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s do it more carefully.

Let me make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let’s set t = 2n x. Then when x goes from 0 to pi, t goes from 0 to 2n pi. Then dx = dt/(2n). So substituting into the integral, we get:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \frac{t}{2n} |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Wait, no, hold on. Let me check that substitution again. If t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), so dx = dt/(2n). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \left( \frac{t}{2n} \right) |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \]

So the original integral is equal to (1/(4n²)) times the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ. Then, we need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/(4n²)) times that integral. So the problem reduces to understanding the growth of the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ as n becomes large.

Now, let me analyze the integral I(n) = ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt. Let&#x27;s consider splitting this integral into a sum over each period of |sin t|. Since |sin t| has period π, the interval from 0 to 2nπ can be divided into 2n intervals each of length π. So:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} ∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt

But in each interval [kπ, (k+1)π], |sin t| = |sin(t - kπ)|, which is sin(t - kπ) when k is even and sin(t - kπ) when k is odd, but since it&#x27;s absolute value, it&#x27;s just sin(t&#x27;) where t&#x27; = t - kπ. So in each interval, we can substitute t = kπ + u, where u goes from 0 to π. Then:

∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt = ∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) |sin(kπ + u)| du

But |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u| because sin(kπ + u) = sin u if k is even (since sin(kπ + u) = sin u when k even) and sin(kπ + u) = sin(u + π) = -sin u when k is odd, but absolute value makes it |sin u| in either case. Therefore, |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u|. But since u is from 0 to π, |sin u| = sin u. Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) sin u du

So substituting back:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} [ kπ ∫_{0}^{\pi} \sin u du + ∫_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u du ]

Let me compute those two integrals separately. First, ∫₀^π sin u du = 2, since the integral of sin u is -cos u, evaluated from 0 to pi: -cos pi + cos 0 = -(-1) + 1 = 2. Second, ∫₀^π u sin u du. That integral can be computed via integration by parts. Let me do that.

Let u = t, dv = sin t dt. Then du = dt, v = -cos t. So:

∫ t sin t dt = -t cos t + ∫ cos t dt = -t cos t + sin t + C

Evaluated from 0 to pi:

[-pi cos pi + sin pi] - [0 + sin 0] = -pi*(-1) + 0 - 0 = pi

So ∫₀^π u sin u du = pi

Therefore, each term in the sum becomes:

kπ * 2 + pi = 2kπ + pi

Therefore, I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} (2kπ + pi) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 2kπ + Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} pi

Let&#x27;s compute the two sums separately.

First sum: 2π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} k = 2π * [ (2n - 1)(2n) ) / 2 ] = 2π * [ (4n² - 2n) / 2 ] = 2π * (2n² - n ) = 4π n² - 2π n

Second sum: π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 1 = π * 2n = 2π n

Therefore, I(n) = 4π n² - 2π n + 2π n = 4π n²

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. The -2π n and +2π n cancel out, so I(n) = 4π n².

So going back to the original expression, the integral we had was (1/(4n²)) * I(n) = (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π

Wait, so the integral simplifies to π, and since we&#x27;re taking the limit as n approaches infinity, the limit is π? But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, first, substitution t = 2n x, so x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{2nπ} (t/(2n)) |sin t| * (dt/(2n)) = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt

Which we called I(n). Then we split I(n) into 2n intervals of length pi each, substituted each integral, found that each contributes 2kπ + pi, summed over k from 0 to 2n - 1, which gave 4π n².

Therefore, (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π. Therefore, the integral evaluates to π for any n? But that can&#x27;t be, because when n increases, the integral is oscillating? Wait, but according to this calculation, regardless of n, the integral is exactly π. So the limit as n approaches infinity is π? Hmm, but that seems counterintuitive because if you have x multiplied by |sin(2nx)|, which is oscillating rapidly, but the average value of |sin(2nx)| is 2/pi, so integrating x*(2/pi) from 0 to pi would give (2/pi)*(pi²/2) = pi. So that&#x27;s the same result. So in fact, the integral is equal to pi for all n? Wait, that seems strange.

Wait, no, the substitution led us to I(n) = 4π n², so when we multiply by 1/(4n²), it cancels out, leaving π. So does that mean that the integral is exactly equal to pi for any n? That seems incorrect because if n is 1, let&#x27;s test n=1. Compute the integral from 0 to pi of x |sin(2x)| dx. Let me compute that numerically.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute ∫₀^π x |sin(2x)| dx when n=1. Let&#x27;s split the integral into intervals where sin(2x) is positive and negative. Since sin(2x) is positive in [0, pi/2] and negative in [pi/2, pi]. So |sin(2x)| = sin(2x) in [0, pi/2] and -sin(2x) in [pi/2, pi].

So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{pi/2} x sin(2x) dx + ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx

But let&#x27;s compute these two integrals. Let me compute the first one: ∫ x sin(2x) dx. Integration by parts. Let u = x, dv = sin(2x) dx. Then du = dx, v = -1/2 cos(2x).

So ∫ x sin(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/2) ∫ cos(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x) + C

Evaluate from 0 to pi/2:

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

At 0: -0 + 0 = 0

So the first integral is pi/4.

Second integral: ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx = - ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x sin(2x) dx

Again, integration by parts:

Same as before, integral of x sin(2x) dx is -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x)

Evaluate from pi/2 to pi:

At pi: -pi/2 cos(2pi) + (1/4) sin(2pi) = -pi/2 * 1 + 0 = -pi/2

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

Therefore, the integral is [ -pi/2 - pi/4 ] = -3pi/4, but multiplied by the negative sign outside:

- [ -3pi/4 ] = 3pi/4

Therefore, the second integral is 3pi/4

So total integral for n=1 is pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi. Which matches our previous result. So the integral is indeed pi when n=1. Wait, so does that mean that the integral is always pi, regardless of n? Let&#x27;s test n=2.

Wait, for n=2, the integral is ∫₀^pi x |sin(4x)| dx. Let me check if that&#x27;s pi as well.

Again, split into intervals where sin(4x) is positive and negative. The zeros of sin(4x) are at x = k pi /4, so between 0 and pi, the zeros are at 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi. So intervals: [0, pi/4], [pi/4, pi/2], [pi/2, 3pi/4], [3pi/4, pi]. The sign alternates each interval.

But computing this integral would be tedious, but according to our general formula, it should also equal pi. Let me see.

But perhaps there&#x27;s a pattern here. If the integral equals pi for n=1 and n=2, then maybe for all n, the integral is equal to pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi. But that seems counterintuitive at first, but maybe it&#x27;s correct.

Wait, the reasoning via substitution gave us that for any n, the integral equals pi. So even before taking the limit, the integral is pi. Therefore, the limit is pi.

But that seems surprising. Let me check with another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the average of |sin(2nx)| over the interval. Since |sin(2nx)| has average value 2/pi over each period. Then, if we can write the integral as ∫₀^pi x * |sin(2nx)| dx ≈ ∫₀^pi x * (2/pi) dx = (2/pi) * (pi² / 2) = pi. So that also gives pi.

But this is only an approximation when n is large, right? But according to the substitution method, it&#x27;s exact for any n. So maybe the integral is exactly pi for any n. But then why does the problem ask for the limit as n approaches infinity? If the integral is pi for all n, then the limit is pi. But maybe the problem is set in such a way that regardless of n, the integral is pi. Wait, but how is that possible?

Wait, when we did the substitution, we saw that the integral is exactly pi, regardless of n. So even when n is 1, 2, 3, etc., the integral is exactly pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is just pi. So the answer is pi.

But that seems too straightforward. Maybe the problem was designed to test if we realize that despite the oscillating function, the integral evaluates to the same value for any n. But why is that?

Let me verify for n=1/2. Wait, n is an integer going to infinity, but if we take n=1/2, which is not an integer, but just to see. Wait, no, n is a positive integer here. But in any case, the substitution works for any positive real n, but in the problem, n is approaching infinity through integer values. However, the key point is that the integral is always pi. So regardless of n, the integral is pi, so the limit is pi.

But that seems strange. Let me check n=1 case again. Wait, when n=1, the integral is pi. When n=2, the integral is pi. Wait, so is this a general result? For any integer n, ∫₀^pi x |sin(2n x)| dx = pi. How is that possible?

Wait, but if we make substitution t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). The integral becomes (1/(2n)) ∫₀^{2n pi} [t/(2n)] |sin t| dt = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2n pi} t |sin t| dt. Then, according to our previous calculation, that integral is 4 pi n², so (1/(4n²)) * 4 pi n² = pi. So yes, this shows that for any n, the integral equals pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi.

So the answer is pi. Therefore, the box answer is \boxed{\pi}

But let me just verify once more with n=1. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx, we saw earlier that it&#x27;s pi. Let me compute numerically for n=1. Let&#x27;s use approximate values.

The integral for n=1 was pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi, which is approximately 3.1416. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx numerically, say using trapezoidal rule with a few intervals, would I get roughly pi?

Let&#x27;s try. Divide [0, pi] into four intervals: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi.

Compute x |sin(2x)| at these points:

At 0: 0 * |0| = 0

At pi/4: (pi/4) * |sin(pi/2)| = (pi/4)*1 ≈ 0.7854

At pi/2: (pi/2)*|sin(pi)| = (pi/2)*0 = 0

At 3pi/4: (3pi/4)*|sin(3pi/2)| = (3pi/4)*1 ≈ 2.3562

At pi: pi * |sin(2pi)| = pi * 0 = 0

Using trapezoidal rule:

Approximate integral ≈ (pi/4)/2 [0 + 2*(0.7854) + 2*0 + 2*(2.3562) + 0] = (pi/8) [0 + 1.5708 + 0 + 4.7124 + 0] = (pi/8)*(6.2832) ≈ (pi/8)*(2pi) ≈ (pi^2)/4 ≈ 2.4674

But pi is approximately 3.1416, so this is a rough approximation. The trapezoidal rule with four intervals isn&#x27;t very accurate here because the function is oscillating. But if we take more intervals, it would approach pi. For example, if we take n=1 and compute the integral using more intervals, it should approach pi.

Alternatively, trust the analytical result which shows that the integral is exactly pi for any n. Therefore, the limit is pi.

Wait, this is fascinating. So the integral ∫₀^pi x |sin(2nx)| dx is equal to pi for any positive integer n, hence the limit as n approaches infinity is also pi. Therefore, the answer is pi. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\pi}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\pi}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\), we start by considering the integral involving the rapidly oscillating function \( |\sin(2nx)| \).

First, we make a substitution \( t = 2nx \), which transforms the integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx = \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt
\]

Next, we analyze the integral \( \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \). By splitting this integral into intervals of length \( \pi \), we recognize that each interval contributes:
\[
\int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du
\]

This integral can be decomposed and evaluated using integration by parts:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du = k\pi \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du + \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du
\]

The results of these integrals are:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du = \pi
\]

Summing these contributions over all intervals from \( k = 0 \) to \( 2n - 1 \), we find:
\[
\int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} (2k\pi + \pi) = 4\pi n^2
\]

Substituting back into the original integral, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{4n^2} \cdot 4\pi n^2 = \pi
\]

Thus, the integral \(\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\) evaluates to \(\pi\) for any \( n \). Therefore, the limit as \( n \to \infty \) is:
\[
\boxed{\pi}

Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of the integral from 0 to pi of x times the absolute value of sin(2nx) dx. Hmm. Let me write that down properly to visualize it better.

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx \]

Okay, so the integral involves x multiplied by the absolute value of sin(2nx), and we need to find its limit as n becomes very large. First, I remember that integrals involving rapidly oscillating functions like sine or cosine can sometimes be simplified using methods like the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma or by considering the average value over the oscillations. But here, there&#x27;s an absolute value, which complicates things a bit because the absolute value of sine is a non-negative function with period pi/n instead of 2pi/n. Wait, let me check that.

The function sin(2nx) has a period of pi/n because the period of sin(kx) is 2pi/k, so here k is 2n, so period is 2pi/(2n) = pi/n. But when we take the absolute value, the period halves, so the period of |sin(2nx)| is pi/(2n). So each &quot;hill&quot; of the sine wave becomes a hump from 0 to pi/(2n), then another hump from pi/(2n) to pi/n, etc. So the function |sin(2nx)| oscillates very rapidly as n becomes large, with period pi/n. So the integral is over x from 0 to pi, multiplied by this oscillating function.

Now, since n is going to infinity, the oscillations are getting extremely rapid, so maybe we can use the concept of the average value of the function over each period. I recall that for a rapidly oscillating function, the integral can be approximated by integrating the function against the average value of the oscillating part. So perhaps the x term can be treated as a constant over each small interval of length pi/n, and then multiplied by the average of |sin(2nx)| over that interval.

Let me recall that the average value of |sin(u)| over one period pi (since the period of |sin(u)| is pi). The average value is (2/pi). Because the integral of |sin(u)| over 0 to pi is 2, so the average is 2/pi. Therefore, if we can replace |sin(2nx)| by its average value 2/pi, then the integral becomes the integral of x*(2/pi) dx from 0 to pi, and then take the limit as n goes to infinity. But wait, does that work here?

Wait, but the problem is that x is also varying over the interval [0, pi], so maybe we need to be more careful. Let me think. If the oscillations are very rapid, then over each small interval, x is approximately constant, and the integral over that interval can be approximated by x (constant) times the integral of |sin(2nx)| over that interval. Then, since the integral of |sin(2nx)| over each period pi/n is 2/(2n) * 2 = 2/(2n)? Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s do it more carefully.

Let me make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let’s set t = 2n x. Then when x goes from 0 to pi, t goes from 0 to 2n pi. Then dx = dt/(2n). So substituting into the integral, we get:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \frac{t}{2n} |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Wait, no, hold on. Let me check that substitution again. If t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), so dx = dt/(2n). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \left( \frac{t}{2n} \right) |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \]

So the original integral is equal to (1/(4n²)) times the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ. Then, we need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/(4n²)) times that integral. So the problem reduces to understanding the growth of the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ as n becomes large.

Now, let me analyze the integral I(n) = ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt. Let&#x27;s consider splitting this integral into a sum over each period of |sin t|. Since |sin t| has period π, the interval from 0 to 2nπ can be divided into 2n intervals each of length π. So:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} ∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt

But in each interval [kπ, (k+1)π], |sin t| = |sin(t - kπ)|, which is sin(t - kπ) when k is even and sin(t - kπ) when k is odd, but since it&#x27;s absolute value, it&#x27;s just sin(t&#x27;) where t&#x27; = t - kπ. So in each interval, we can substitute t = kπ + u, where u goes from 0 to π. Then:

∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt = ∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) |sin(kπ + u)| du

But |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u| because sin(kπ + u) = sin u if k is even (since sin(kπ + u) = sin u when k even) and sin(kπ + u) = sin(u + π) = -sin u when k is odd, but absolute value makes it |sin u| in either case. Therefore, |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u|. But since u is from 0 to π, |sin u| = sin u. Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) sin u du

So substituting back:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} [ kπ ∫_{0}^{\pi} \sin u du + ∫_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u du ]

Let me compute those two integrals separately. First, ∫₀^π sin u du = 2, since the integral of sin u is -cos u, evaluated from 0 to pi: -cos pi + cos 0 = -(-1) + 1 = 2. Second, ∫₀^π u sin u du. That integral can be computed via integration by parts. Let me do that.

Let u = t, dv = sin t dt. Then du = dt, v = -cos t. So:

∫ t sin t dt = -t cos t + ∫ cos t dt = -t cos t + sin t + C

Evaluated from 0 to pi:

[-pi cos pi + sin pi] - [0 + sin 0] = -pi*(-1) + 0 - 0 = pi

So ∫₀^π u sin u du = pi

Therefore, each term in the sum becomes:

kπ * 2 + pi = 2kπ + pi

Therefore, I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} (2kπ + pi) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 2kπ + Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} pi

Let&#x27;s compute the two sums separately.

First sum: 2π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} k = 2π * [ (2n - 1)(2n) ) / 2 ] = 2π * [ (4n² - 2n) / 2 ] = 2π * (2n² - n ) = 4π n² - 2π n

Second sum: π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 1 = π * 2n = 2π n

Therefore, I(n) = 4π n² - 2π n + 2π n = 4π n²

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. The -2π n and +2π n cancel out, so I(n) = 4π n².

So going back to the original expression, the integral we had was (1/(4n²)) * I(n) = (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π

Wait, so the integral simplifies to π, and since we&#x27;re taking the limit as n approaches infinity, the limit is π? But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, first, substitution t = 2n x, so x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{2nπ} (t/(2n)) |sin t| * (dt/(2n)) = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt

Which we called I(n). Then we split I(n) into 2n intervals of length pi each, substituted each integral, found that each contributes 2kπ + pi, summed over k from 0 to 2n - 1, which gave 4π n².

Therefore, (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π. Therefore, the integral evaluates to π for any n? But that can&#x27;t be, because when n increases, the integral is oscillating? Wait, but according to this calculation, regardless of n, the integral is exactly π. So the limit as n approaches infinity is π? Hmm, but that seems counterintuitive because if you have x multiplied by |sin(2nx)|, which is oscillating rapidly, but the average value of |sin(2nx)| is 2/pi, so integrating x*(2/pi) from 0 to pi would give (2/pi)*(pi²/2) = pi. So that&#x27;s the same result. So in fact, the integral is equal to pi for all n? Wait, that seems strange.

Wait, no, the substitution led us to I(n) = 4π n², so when we multiply by 1/(4n²), it cancels out, leaving π. So does that mean that the integral is exactly equal to pi for any n? That seems incorrect because if n is 1, let&#x27;s test n=1. Compute the integral from 0 to pi of x |sin(2x)| dx. Let me compute that numerically.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute ∫₀^π x |sin(2x)| dx when n=1. Let&#x27;s split the integral into intervals where sin(2x) is positive and negative. Since sin(2x) is positive in [0, pi/2] and negative in [pi/2, pi]. So |sin(2x)| = sin(2x) in [0, pi/2] and -sin(2x) in [pi/2, pi].

So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{pi/2} x sin(2x) dx + ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx

But let&#x27;s compute these two integrals. Let me compute the first one: ∫ x sin(2x) dx. Integration by parts. Let u = x, dv = sin(2x) dx. Then du = dx, v = -1/2 cos(2x).

So ∫ x sin(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/2) ∫ cos(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x) + C

Evaluate from 0 to pi/2:

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

At 0: -0 + 0 = 0

So the first integral is pi/4.

Second integral: ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx = - ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x sin(2x) dx

Again, integration by parts:

Same as before, integral of x sin(2x) dx is -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x)

Evaluate from pi/2 to pi:

At pi: -pi/2 cos(2pi) + (1/4) sin(2pi) = -pi/2 * 1 + 0 = -pi/2

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

Therefore, the integral is [ -pi/2 - pi/4 ] = -3pi/4, but multiplied by the negative sign outside:

- [ -3pi/4 ] = 3pi/4

Therefore, the second integral is 3pi/4

So total integral for n=1 is pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi. Which matches our previous result. So the integral is indeed pi when n=1. Wait, so does that mean that the integral is always pi, regardless of n? Let&#x27;s test n=2.

Wait, for n=2, the integral is ∫₀^pi x |sin(4x)| dx. Let me check if that&#x27;s pi as well.

Again, split into intervals where sin(4x) is positive and negative. The zeros of sin(4x) are at x = k pi /4, so between 0 and pi, the zeros are at 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi. So intervals: [0, pi/4], [pi/4, pi/2], [pi/2, 3pi/4], [3pi/4, pi]. The sign alternates each interval.

But computing this integral would be tedious, but according to our general formula, it should also equal pi. Let me see.

But perhaps there&#x27;s a pattern here. If the integral equals pi for n=1 and n=2, then maybe for all n, the integral is equal to pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi. But that seems counterintuitive at first, but maybe it&#x27;s correct.

Wait, the reasoning via substitution gave us that for any n, the integral equals pi. So even before taking the limit, the integral is pi. Therefore, the limit is pi.

But that seems surprising. Let me check with another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the average of |sin(2nx)| over the interval. Since |sin(2nx)| has average value 2/pi over each period. Then, if we can write the integral as ∫₀^pi x * |sin(2nx)| dx ≈ ∫₀^pi x * (2/pi) dx = (2/pi) * (pi² / 2) = pi. So that also gives pi.

But this is only an approximation when n is large, right? But according to the substitution method, it&#x27;s exact for any n. So maybe the integral is exactly pi for any n. But then why does the problem ask for the limit as n approaches infinity? If the integral is pi for all n, then the limit is pi. But maybe the problem is set in such a way that regardless of n, the integral is pi. Wait, but how is that possible?

Wait, when we did the substitution, we saw that the integral is exactly pi, regardless of n. So even when n is 1, 2, 3, etc., the integral is exactly pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is just pi. So the answer is pi.

But that seems too straightforward. Maybe the problem was designed to test if we realize that despite the oscillating function, the integral evaluates to the same value for any n. But why is that?

Let me verify for n=1/2. Wait, n is an integer going to infinity, but if we take n=1/2, which is not an integer, but just to see. Wait, no, n is a positive integer here. But in any case, the substitution works for any positive real n, but in the problem, n is approaching infinity through integer values. However, the key point is that the integral is always pi. So regardless of n, the integral is pi, so the limit is pi.

But that seems strange. Let me check n=1 case again. Wait, when n=1, the integral is pi. When n=2, the integral is pi. Wait, so is this a general result? For any integer n, ∫₀^pi x |sin(2n x)| dx = pi. How is that possible?

Wait, but if we make substitution t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). The integral becomes (1/(2n)) ∫₀^{2n pi} [t/(2n)] |sin t| dt = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2n pi} t |sin t| dt. Then, according to our previous calculation, that integral is 4 pi n², so (1/(4n²)) * 4 pi n² = pi. So yes, this shows that for any n, the integral equals pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi.

So the answer is pi. Therefore, the box answer is \boxed{\pi}

But let me just verify once more with n=1. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx, we saw earlier that it&#x27;s pi. Let me compute numerically for n=1. Let&#x27;s use approximate values.

The integral for n=1 was pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi, which is approximately 3.1416. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx numerically, say using trapezoidal rule with a few intervals, would I get roughly pi?

Let&#x27;s try. Divide [0, pi] into four intervals: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi.

Compute x |sin(2x)| at these points:

At 0: 0 * |0| = 0

At pi/4: (pi/4) * |sin(pi/2)| = (pi/4)*1 ≈ 0.7854

At pi/2: (pi/2)*|sin(pi)| = (pi/2)*0 = 0

At 3pi/4: (3pi/4)*|sin(3pi/2)| = (3pi/4)*1 ≈ 2.3562

At pi: pi * |sin(2pi)| = pi * 0 = 0

Using trapezoidal rule:

Approximate integral ≈ (pi/4)/2 [0 + 2*(0.7854) + 2*0 + 2*(2.3562) + 0] = (pi/8) [0 + 1.5708 + 0 + 4.7124 + 0] = (pi/8)*(6.2832) ≈ (pi/8)*(2pi) ≈ (pi^2)/4 ≈ 2.4674

But pi is approximately 3.1416, so this is a rough approximation. The trapezoidal rule with four intervals isn&#x27;t very accurate here because the function is oscillating. But if we take more intervals, it would approach pi. For example, if we take n=1 and compute the integral using more intervals, it should approach pi.

Alternatively, trust the analytical result which shows that the integral is exactly pi for any n. Therefore, the limit is pi.

Wait, this is fascinating. So the integral ∫₀^pi x |sin(2nx)| dx is equal to pi for any positive integer n, hence the limit as n approaches infinity is also pi. Therefore, the answer is pi. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\pi}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\pi}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\), we start by considering the integral involving the rapidly oscillating function \( |\sin(2nx)| \).

First, we make a substitution \( t = 2nx \), which transforms the integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx = \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt
\]

Next, we analyze the integral \( \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \). By splitting this integral into intervals of length \( \pi \), we recognize that each interval contributes:
\[
\int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du
\]

This integral can be decomposed and evaluated using integration by parts:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du = k\pi \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du + \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du
\]

The results of these integrals are:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du = \pi
\]

Summing these contributions over all intervals from \( k = 0 \) to \( 2n - 1 \), we find:
\[
\int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} (2k\pi + \pi) = 4\pi n^2
\]

Substituting back into the original integral, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{4n^2} \cdot 4\pi n^2 = \pi
\]

Thus, the integral \(\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\) evaluates to \(\pi\) for any \( n \). Therefore, the limit as \( n \to \infty \) is:
\[
\boxed{\pi}

Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of the integral from 0 to pi of x times the absolute value of sin(2nx) dx. Hmm. Let me write that down properly to visualize it better.

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx \]

Okay, so the integral involves x multiplied by the absolute value of sin(2nx), and we need to find its limit as n becomes very large. First, I remember that integrals involving rapidly oscillating functions like sine or cosine can sometimes be simplified using methods like the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma or by considering the average value over the oscillations. But here, there&#x27;s an absolute value, which complicates things a bit because the absolute value of sine is a non-negative function with period pi/n instead of 2pi/n. Wait, let me check that.

The function sin(2nx) has a period of pi/n because the period of sin(kx) is 2pi/k, so here k is 2n, so period is 2pi/(2n) = pi/n. But when we take the absolute value, the period halves, so the period of |sin(2nx)| is pi/(2n). So each &quot;hill&quot; of the sine wave becomes a hump from 0 to pi/(2n), then another hump from pi/(2n) to pi/n, etc. So the function |sin(2nx)| oscillates very rapidly as n becomes large, with period pi/n. So the integral is over x from 0 to pi, multiplied by this oscillating function.

Now, since n is going to infinity, the oscillations are getting extremely rapid, so maybe we can use the concept of the average value of the function over each period. I recall that for a rapidly oscillating function, the integral can be approximated by integrating the function against the average value of the oscillating part. So perhaps the x term can be treated as a constant over each small interval of length pi/n, and then multiplied by the average of |sin(2nx)| over that interval.

Let me recall that the average value of |sin(u)| over one period pi (since the period of |sin(u)| is pi). The average value is (2/pi). Because the integral of |sin(u)| over 0 to pi is 2, so the average is 2/pi. Therefore, if we can replace |sin(2nx)| by its average value 2/pi, then the integral becomes the integral of x*(2/pi) dx from 0 to pi, and then take the limit as n goes to infinity. But wait, does that work here?

Wait, but the problem is that x is also varying over the interval [0, pi], so maybe we need to be more careful. Let me think. If the oscillations are very rapid, then over each small interval, x is approximately constant, and the integral over that interval can be approximated by x (constant) times the integral of |sin(2nx)| over that interval. Then, since the integral of |sin(2nx)| over each period pi/n is 2/(2n) * 2 = 2/(2n)? Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s do it more carefully.

Let me make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let’s set t = 2n x. Then when x goes from 0 to pi, t goes from 0 to 2n pi. Then dx = dt/(2n). So substituting into the integral, we get:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \frac{t}{2n} |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Wait, no, hold on. Let me check that substitution again. If t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), so dx = dt/(2n). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \left( \frac{t}{2n} \right) |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \]

So the original integral is equal to (1/(4n²)) times the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ. Then, we need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/(4n²)) times that integral. So the problem reduces to understanding the growth of the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ as n becomes large.

Now, let me analyze the integral I(n) = ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt. Let&#x27;s consider splitting this integral into a sum over each period of |sin t|. Since |sin t| has period π, the interval from 0 to 2nπ can be divided into 2n intervals each of length π. So:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} ∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt

But in each interval [kπ, (k+1)π], |sin t| = |sin(t - kπ)|, which is sin(t - kπ) when k is even and sin(t - kπ) when k is odd, but since it&#x27;s absolute value, it&#x27;s just sin(t&#x27;) where t&#x27; = t - kπ. So in each interval, we can substitute t = kπ + u, where u goes from 0 to π. Then:

∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt = ∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) |sin(kπ + u)| du

But |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u| because sin(kπ + u) = sin u if k is even (since sin(kπ + u) = sin u when k even) and sin(kπ + u) = sin(u + π) = -sin u when k is odd, but absolute value makes it |sin u| in either case. Therefore, |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u|. But since u is from 0 to π, |sin u| = sin u. Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) sin u du

So substituting back:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} [ kπ ∫_{0}^{\pi} \sin u du + ∫_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u du ]

Let me compute those two integrals separately. First, ∫₀^π sin u du = 2, since the integral of sin u is -cos u, evaluated from 0 to pi: -cos pi + cos 0 = -(-1) + 1 = 2. Second, ∫₀^π u sin u du. That integral can be computed via integration by parts. Let me do that.

Let u = t, dv = sin t dt. Then du = dt, v = -cos t. So:

∫ t sin t dt = -t cos t + ∫ cos t dt = -t cos t + sin t + C

Evaluated from 0 to pi:

[-pi cos pi + sin pi] - [0 + sin 0] = -pi*(-1) + 0 - 0 = pi

So ∫₀^π u sin u du = pi

Therefore, each term in the sum becomes:

kπ * 2 + pi = 2kπ + pi

Therefore, I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} (2kπ + pi) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 2kπ + Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} pi

Let&#x27;s compute the two sums separately.

First sum: 2π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} k = 2π * [ (2n - 1)(2n) ) / 2 ] = 2π * [ (4n² - 2n) / 2 ] = 2π * (2n² - n ) = 4π n² - 2π n

Second sum: π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 1 = π * 2n = 2π n

Therefore, I(n) = 4π n² - 2π n + 2π n = 4π n²

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. The -2π n and +2π n cancel out, so I(n) = 4π n².

So going back to the original expression, the integral we had was (1/(4n²)) * I(n) = (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π

Wait, so the integral simplifies to π, and since we&#x27;re taking the limit as n approaches infinity, the limit is π? But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, first, substitution t = 2n x, so x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{2nπ} (t/(2n)) |sin t| * (dt/(2n)) = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt

Which we called I(n). Then we split I(n) into 2n intervals of length pi each, substituted each integral, found that each contributes 2kπ + pi, summed over k from 0 to 2n - 1, which gave 4π n².

Therefore, (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π. Therefore, the integral evaluates to π for any n? But that can&#x27;t be, because when n increases, the integral is oscillating? Wait, but according to this calculation, regardless of n, the integral is exactly π. So the limit as n approaches infinity is π? Hmm, but that seems counterintuitive because if you have x multiplied by |sin(2nx)|, which is oscillating rapidly, but the average value of |sin(2nx)| is 2/pi, so integrating x*(2/pi) from 0 to pi would give (2/pi)*(pi²/2) = pi. So that&#x27;s the same result. So in fact, the integral is equal to pi for all n? Wait, that seems strange.

Wait, no, the substitution led us to I(n) = 4π n², so when we multiply by 1/(4n²), it cancels out, leaving π. So does that mean that the integral is exactly equal to pi for any n? That seems incorrect because if n is 1, let&#x27;s test n=1. Compute the integral from 0 to pi of x |sin(2x)| dx. Let me compute that numerically.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute ∫₀^π x |sin(2x)| dx when n=1. Let&#x27;s split the integral into intervals where sin(2x) is positive and negative. Since sin(2x) is positive in [0, pi/2] and negative in [pi/2, pi]. So |sin(2x)| = sin(2x) in [0, pi/2] and -sin(2x) in [pi/2, pi].

So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{pi/2} x sin(2x) dx + ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx

But let&#x27;s compute these two integrals. Let me compute the first one: ∫ x sin(2x) dx. Integration by parts. Let u = x, dv = sin(2x) dx. Then du = dx, v = -1/2 cos(2x).

So ∫ x sin(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/2) ∫ cos(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x) + C

Evaluate from 0 to pi/2:

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

At 0: -0 + 0 = 0

So the first integral is pi/4.

Second integral: ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx = - ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x sin(2x) dx

Again, integration by parts:

Same as before, integral of x sin(2x) dx is -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x)

Evaluate from pi/2 to pi:

At pi: -pi/2 cos(2pi) + (1/4) sin(2pi) = -pi/2 * 1 + 0 = -pi/2

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

Therefore, the integral is [ -pi/2 - pi/4 ] = -3pi/4, but multiplied by the negative sign outside:

- [ -3pi/4 ] = 3pi/4

Therefore, the second integral is 3pi/4

So total integral for n=1 is pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi. Which matches our previous result. So the integral is indeed pi when n=1. Wait, so does that mean that the integral is always pi, regardless of n? Let&#x27;s test n=2.

Wait, for n=2, the integral is ∫₀^pi x |sin(4x)| dx. Let me check if that&#x27;s pi as well.

Again, split into intervals where sin(4x) is positive and negative. The zeros of sin(4x) are at x = k pi /4, so between 0 and pi, the zeros are at 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi. So intervals: [0, pi/4], [pi/4, pi/2], [pi/2, 3pi/4], [3pi/4, pi]. The sign alternates each interval.

But computing this integral would be tedious, but according to our general formula, it should also equal pi. Let me see.

But perhaps there&#x27;s a pattern here. If the integral equals pi for n=1 and n=2, then maybe for all n, the integral is equal to pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi. But that seems counterintuitive at first, but maybe it&#x27;s correct.

Wait, the reasoning via substitution gave us that for any n, the integral equals pi. So even before taking the limit, the integral is pi. Therefore, the limit is pi.

But that seems surprising. Let me check with another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the average of |sin(2nx)| over the interval. Since |sin(2nx)| has average value 2/pi over each period. Then, if we can write the integral as ∫₀^pi x * |sin(2nx)| dx ≈ ∫₀^pi x * (2/pi) dx = (2/pi) * (pi² / 2) = pi. So that also gives pi.

But this is only an approximation when n is large, right? But according to the substitution method, it&#x27;s exact for any n. So maybe the integral is exactly pi for any n. But then why does the problem ask for the limit as n approaches infinity? If the integral is pi for all n, then the limit is pi. But maybe the problem is set in such a way that regardless of n, the integral is pi. Wait, but how is that possible?

Wait, when we did the substitution, we saw that the integral is exactly pi, regardless of n. So even when n is 1, 2, 3, etc., the integral is exactly pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is just pi. So the answer is pi.

But that seems too straightforward. Maybe the problem was designed to test if we realize that despite the oscillating function, the integral evaluates to the same value for any n. But why is that?

Let me verify for n=1/2. Wait, n is an integer going to infinity, but if we take n=1/2, which is not an integer, but just to see. Wait, no, n is a positive integer here. But in any case, the substitution works for any positive real n, but in the problem, n is approaching infinity through integer values. However, the key point is that the integral is always pi. So regardless of n, the integral is pi, so the limit is pi.

But that seems strange. Let me check n=1 case again. Wait, when n=1, the integral is pi. When n=2, the integral is pi. Wait, so is this a general result? For any integer n, ∫₀^pi x |sin(2n x)| dx = pi. How is that possible?

Wait, but if we make substitution t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). The integral becomes (1/(2n)) ∫₀^{2n pi} [t/(2n)] |sin t| dt = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2n pi} t |sin t| dt. Then, according to our previous calculation, that integral is 4 pi n², so (1/(4n²)) * 4 pi n² = pi. So yes, this shows that for any n, the integral equals pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi.

So the answer is pi. Therefore, the box answer is \boxed{\pi}

But let me just verify once more with n=1. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx, we saw earlier that it&#x27;s pi. Let me compute numerically for n=1. Let&#x27;s use approximate values.

The integral for n=1 was pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi, which is approximately 3.1416. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx numerically, say using trapezoidal rule with a few intervals, would I get roughly pi?

Let&#x27;s try. Divide [0, pi] into four intervals: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi.

Compute x |sin(2x)| at these points:

At 0: 0 * |0| = 0

At pi/4: (pi/4) * |sin(pi/2)| = (pi/4)*1 ≈ 0.7854

At pi/2: (pi/2)*|sin(pi)| = (pi/2)*0 = 0

At 3pi/4: (3pi/4)*|sin(3pi/2)| = (3pi/4)*1 ≈ 2.3562

At pi: pi * |sin(2pi)| = pi * 0 = 0

Using trapezoidal rule:

Approximate integral ≈ (pi/4)/2 [0 + 2*(0.7854) + 2*0 + 2*(2.3562) + 0] = (pi/8) [0 + 1.5708 + 0 + 4.7124 + 0] = (pi/8)*(6.2832) ≈ (pi/8)*(2pi) ≈ (pi^2)/4 ≈ 2.4674

But pi is approximately 3.1416, so this is a rough approximation. The trapezoidal rule with four intervals isn&#x27;t very accurate here because the function is oscillating. But if we take more intervals, it would approach pi. For example, if we take n=1 and compute the integral using more intervals, it should approach pi.

Alternatively, trust the analytical result which shows that the integral is exactly pi for any n. Therefore, the limit is pi.

Wait, this is fascinating. So the integral ∫₀^pi x |sin(2nx)| dx is equal to pi for any positive integer n, hence the limit as n approaches infinity is also pi. Therefore, the answer is pi. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\pi}

&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\), we start by considering the integral involving the rapidly oscillating function \( |\sin(2nx)| \).

First, we make a substitution \( t = 2nx \), which transforms the integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx = \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt

Next, we analyze the integral \( \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \). By splitting this integral into intervals of length \( \pi \), we recognize that each interval contributes:
\[
\int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du
\]

This integral can be decomposed and evaluated using integration by parts:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du = k\pi \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du + \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du
\]

The results of these integrals are:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du = \pi
\]

Summing these contributions over all intervals from \( k = 0 \) to \( 2n - 1 \), we find:
\[
\int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} (2k\pi + \pi) = 4\pi n^2
\]

Substituting back into the original integral, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{4n^2} \cdot 4\pi n^2 = \pi
\]

Thus, the integral \(\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\) evaluates to \(\pi\) for any \( n \). Therefore, the limit as \( n \to \infty \) is:

Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of the integral from 0 to pi of x times the absolute value of sin(2nx) dx. Hmm. Let me write that down properly to visualize it better.

Okay, so the integral involves x multiplied by the absolute value of sin(2nx), and we need to find its limit as n becomes very large. First, I remember that integrals involving rapidly oscillating functions like sine or cosine can sometimes be simplified using methods like the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma or by considering the average value over the oscillations.

The function sin(2nx) has a period of pi/n because the period of sin(kx) is 2pi/k, so here k is 2n, so period is 2pi/(2n) = pi/n. But when we take the absolute value, the period halves, so the period of |sin(2nx)| is pi/(2n). So each &quot;hill&quot; of the sine wave becomes a hump from 0 to pi/(2n), then another hump from pi/(2n) to pi/n, etc. So the function |sin(2nx)| oscillates very rapidly as n becomes large, with period pi/n. So the integral is over x from 0 to pi, multiplied by this oscillating function.

Now, since n is going to infinity, the oscillations are getting extremely rapid, so maybe we can use the concept of the average value of the function over each period. I recall that for a rapidly oscillating function, the integral can be approximated by integrating the function against the average value of the oscillating part. So perhaps the x term can be treated as a constant over each small interval of length pi/n, and then multiplied by the average of |sin(2nx)| over that interval.

Let me recall that the average value of |sin(u)| over one period pi (since the period of |sin(u)| is pi). The average value is (2/pi). Because the integral of |sin(u)| over 0 to pi is 2, so the average is 2/pi. Therefore, if we can replace |sin(2nx)| by its average value 2/pi, then the integral becomes the integral of x*(2/pi) dx from 0 to pi, and then take the limit as n goes to infinity. But wait, does that work here?

Wait, but the problem is that x is also varying over the interval [0, pi], so maybe we need to be more careful. Let me think. If the oscillations are very rapid, then over each small interval, x is approximately constant, and the integral over that interval can be approximated by x (constant) times the integral of |sin(2nx)| over that interval. Then, since the integral of |sin(2nx)| over each period pi/n is 2/(2n) * 2 = 2/(2n)? Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s do it more carefully.

Let me make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let’s set t = 2n x. Then when x goes from 0 to pi, t goes from 0 to 2n pi. Then dx = dt/(2n). So substituting into the integral, we get:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \frac{t}{2n} |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Wait, no, hold on. Let me check that substitution again. If t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), so dx = dt/(2n). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \left( \frac{t}{2n} \right) |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \]

So the original integral is equal to (1/(4n²)) times the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ. Then, we need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/(4n²)) times that integral. So the problem reduces to understanding the growth of the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ as n becomes large.

Now, let me analyze the integral I(n) = ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt. Let&#x27;s consider splitting this integral into a sum over each period of |sin t|. Since |sin t| has period π, the interval from 0 to 2nπ can be divided into 2n intervals each of length π. So:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} ∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt

But in each interval [kπ, (k+1)π], |sin t| = |sin(t - kπ)|, which is sin(t - kπ) when k is even and sin(t - kπ) when k is odd, but since it&#x27;s absolute value, it&#x27;s just sin(t&#x27;) where t&#x27; = t - kπ. So in each interval, we can substitute t = kπ + u, where u goes from 0 to π. Then:

∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt = ∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) |sin(kπ + u)| du

But |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u| because sin(kπ + u) = sin u if k is even (since sin(kπ + u) = sin u when k even) and sin(kπ + u) = sin(u + π) = -sin u when k is odd, but absolute value makes it |sin u| in either case. Therefore, |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u|. But since u is from 0 to π, |sin u| = sin u. Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) sin u du

So substituting back:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} [ kπ ∫_{0}^{\pi} \sin u du + ∫_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u du ]

Let me compute those two integrals separately. First, ∫₀^π sin u du = 2, since the integral of sin u is -cos u, evaluated from 0 to pi: -cos pi + cos 0 = -(-1) + 1 = 2. Second, ∫₀^π u sin u du. That integral can be computed via integration by parts. Let me do that.

Let u = t, dv = sin t dt. Then du = dt, v = -cos t. So:

∫ t sin t dt = -t cos t + ∫ cos t dt = -t cos t + sin t + C

Evaluated from 0 to pi:

[-pi cos pi + sin pi] - [0 + sin 0] = -pi*(-1) + 0 - 0 = pi

So ∫₀^π u sin u du = pi

Therefore, each term in the sum becomes:

kπ * 2 + pi = 2kπ + pi

Therefore, I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} (2kπ + pi) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 2kπ + Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} pi

Let&#x27;s compute the two sums separately.

First sum: 2π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} k = 2π * [ (2n - 1)(2n) ) / 2 ] = 2π * [ (4n² - 2n) / 2 ] = 2π * (2n² - n ) = 4π n² - 2π n

Second sum: π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 1 = π * 2n = 2π n

Therefore, I(n) = 4π n² - 2π n + 2π n = 4π n²

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. The -2π n and +2π n cancel out, so I(n) = 4π n².

So going back to the original expression, the integral we had was (1/(4n²)) * I(n) = (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π

Wait, so the integral simplifies to π, and since we&#x27;re taking the limit as n approaches infinity, the limit is π? But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, first, substitution t = 2n x, so x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{2nπ} (t/(2n)) |sin t| * (dt/(2n)) = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt

Which we called I(n). Then we split I(n) into 2n intervals of length pi each, substituted each integral, found that each contributes 2kπ + pi, summed over k from 0 to 2n - 1, which gave 4π n².

Therefore, (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π. Therefore, the integral evaluates to π for any n? But that can&#x27;t be, because when n increases, the integral is oscillating? Wait, but according to this calculation, regardless of n, the integral is exactly π. So the limit as n approaches infinity is π? Hmm, but that seems counterintuitive because if you have x multiplied by |sin(2nx)|, which is oscillating rapidly, but the average value of |sin(2nx)| is 2/pi, so integrating x*(2/pi) from 0 to pi would give (2/pi)*(pi²/2) = pi. So that&#x27;s the same result. So in fact, the integral is equal to pi for all n? Wait, that seems strange.

Wait, no, the substitution led us to I(n) = 4π n², so when we multiply by 1/(4n²), it cancels out, leaving π. So does that mean that the integral is exactly equal to pi for any n? That seems incorrect because if n is 1, let&#x27;s test n=1. Compute the integral from 0 to pi of x |sin(2x)| dx. Let me compute that numerically.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute ∫₀^π x |sin(2x)| dx when n=1. Let&#x27;s split the integral into intervals where sin(2x) is positive and negative. Since sin(2x) is positive in [0, pi/2] and negative in [pi/2, pi]. So |sin(2x)| = sin(2x) in [0, pi/2] and -sin(2x) in [pi/2, pi].

So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{pi/2} x sin(2x) dx + ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx

But let&#x27;s compute these two integrals. Let me compute the first one: ∫ x sin(2x) dx. Integration by parts. Let u = x, dv = sin(2x) dx. Then du = dx, v = -1/2 cos(2x).

So ∫ x sin(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/2) ∫ cos(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x) + C

Evaluate from 0 to pi/2:

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

At 0: -0 + 0 = 0

So the first integral is pi/4.

Second integral: ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx = - ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x sin(2x) dx

Again, integration by parts:

Same as before, integral of x sin(2x) dx is -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x)

Evaluate from pi/2 to pi:

At pi: -pi/2 cos(2pi) + (1/4) sin(2pi) = -pi/2 * 1 + 0 = -pi/2

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

Therefore, the integral is [ -pi/2 - pi/4 ] = -3pi/4, but multiplied by the negative sign outside:

- [ -3pi/4 ] = 3pi/4

Therefore, the second integral is 3pi/4

So total integral for n=1 is pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi. Which matches our previous result. So the integral is indeed pi when n=1. Wait, so does that mean that the integral is always pi, regardless of n? Let&#x27;s test n=2.

Wait, for n=2, the integral is ∫₀^pi x |sin(4x)| dx. Let me check if that&#x27;s pi as well.

Again, split into intervals where sin(4x) is positive and negative. The zeros of sin(4x) are at x = k pi /4, so between 0 and pi, the zeros are at 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi. So intervals: [0, pi/4], [pi/4, pi/2], [pi/2, 3pi/4], [3pi/4, pi]. The sign alternates each interval.

But computing this integral would be tedious, but according to our general formula, it should also equal pi. Let me see.

But perhaps there&#x27;s a pattern here. If the integral equals pi for n=1 and n=2, then maybe for all n, the integral is equal to pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi. But that seems counterintuitive at first, but maybe it&#x27;s correct.

Wait, the reasoning via substitution gave us that for any n, the integral equals pi. So even before taking the limit, the integral is pi. Therefore, the limit is pi.

But that seems surprising. Let me check with another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the average of |sin(2nx)| over the interval. Since |sin(2nx)| has average value 2/pi over each period. Then, if we can write the integral as ∫₀^pi x * |sin(2nx)| dx ≈ ∫₀^pi x * (2/pi) dx = (2/pi) * (pi² / 2) = pi. So that also gives pi.

But this is only an approximation when n is large, right? But according to the substitution method, it&#x27;s exact for any n. So maybe the integral is exactly pi for any n. But then why does the problem ask for the limit as n approaches infinity? If the integral is pi for all n, then the limit is pi. But maybe the problem is set in such a way that regardless of n, the integral is pi. Wait, but how is that possible?

Wait, when we did the substitution, we saw that the integral is exactly pi, regardless of n. So even when n is 1, 2, 3, etc., the integral is exactly pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is just pi. So the answer is pi.

But that seems too straightforward. Maybe the problem was designed to test if we realize that despite the oscillating function, the integral evaluates to the same value for any n. But why is that?

Let me verify for n=1/2. Wait, n is an integer going to infinity, but if we take n=1/2, which is not an integer, but just to see. Wait, no, n is a positive integer here. But in any case, the substitution works for any positive real n, but in the problem, n is approaching infinity through integer values. However, the key point is that the integral is always pi. So regardless of n, the integral is pi, so the limit is pi.

But that seems strange. Let me check n=1 case again. Wait, when n=1, the integral is pi. When n=2, the integral is pi. Wait, so is this a general result? For any integer n, ∫₀^pi x |sin(2n x)| dx = pi. How is that possible?

Wait, but if we make substitution t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). The integral becomes (1/(2n)) ∫₀^{2n pi} [t/(2n)] |sin t| dt = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2n pi} t |sin t| dt. Then, according to our previous calculation, that integral is 4 pi n², so (1/(4n²)) * 4 pi n² = pi. So yes, this shows that for any n, the integral equals pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi.

So the answer is pi. Therefore, the box answer is \boxed{\pi}

But let me just verify once more with n=1. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx, we saw earlier that it&#x27;s pi. Let me compute numerically for n=1. Let&#x27;s use approximate values.

The integral for n=1 was pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi, which is approximately 3.1416. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx numerically, say using trapezoidal rule with a few intervals, would I get roughly pi?

Let&#x27;s try. Divide [0, pi] into four intervals: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi.

Compute x |sin(2x)| at these points:

At 0: 0 * |0| = 0

At pi/4: (pi/4) * |sin(pi/2)| = (pi/4)*1 ≈ 0.7854

At pi/2: (pi/2)*|sin(pi)| = (pi/2)*0 = 0

At 3pi/4: (3pi/4)*|sin(3pi/2)| = (3pi/4)*1 ≈ 2.3562

At pi: pi * |sin(2pi)| = pi * 0 = 0

Using trapezoidal rule:

Approximate integral ≈ (pi/4)/2 [0 + 2*(0.7854) + 2*0 + 2*(2.3562) + 0] = (pi/8) [0 + 1.5708 + 0 + 4.7124 + 0] = (pi/8)*(6.2832) ≈ (pi/8)*(2pi) ≈ (pi^2)/4 ≈ 2.4674

But pi is approximately 3.1416, so this is a rough approximation. The trapezoidal rule with four intervals isn&#x27;t very accurate here because the function is oscillating. But if we take more intervals, it would approach pi. For example, if we take n=1 and compute the integral using more intervals, it should approach pi.

Alternatively, trust the analytical result which shows that the integral is exactly pi for any n. Therefore, the limit is pi.

Wait, this is fascinating. So the integral ∫₀^pi x |sin(2nx)| dx is equal to pi for any positive integer n, hence the limit as n approaches infinity is also pi. Therefore, the answer is pi. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\pi}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\pi}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\), we start by considering the integral involving the rapidly oscillating function \( |\sin(2nx)| \).

First, we make a substitution \( t = 2nx \), which transforms the integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx = \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt
\]

Next, we analyze the integral \( \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \). By splitting this integral into intervals of length \( \pi \), we recognize that each interval contributes:
\[
\int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du
\]

This integral can be decomposed and evaluated using integration by parts:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du = k\pi \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du + \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du
\]

The results of these integrals are:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du = \pi
\]

Summing these contributions over all intervals from \( k = 0 \) to \( 2n - 1 \), we find:
\[
\int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} (2k\pi + \pi) = 4\pi n^2
\]

Substituting back into the original integral, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{4n^2} \cdot 4\pi n^2 = \pi
\]

Thus, the integral \(\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\) evaluates to \(\pi\) for any \( n \). Therefore, the limit as \( n \to \infty \) is:
\[
\boxed{\pi}

Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of the integral from 0 to pi of x times the absolute value of sin(2nx) dx. Hmm. Let me write that down properly to visualize it better.

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx \]

Okay, so the integral involves x multiplied by the absolute value of sin(2nx), and we need to find its limit as n becomes very large. First, I remember that integrals involving rapidly oscillating functions like sine or cosine can sometimes be simplified using methods like the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma or by considering the average value over the oscillations. But here, there&#x27;s an absolute value, which complicates things a bit because the absolute value of sine is a non-negative function with period pi/n instead of 2pi/n. Wait, let me check that.

The function sin(2nx) has a period of pi/n because the period of sin(kx) is 2pi/k, so here k is 2n, so period is 2pi/(2n) = pi/n. But when we take the absolute value, the period halves, so the period of |sin(2nx)| is pi/(2n). So each &quot;hill&quot; of the sine wave becomes a hump from 0 to pi/(2n), then another hump from pi/(2n) to pi/n, etc. So the function |sin(2nx)| oscillates very rapidly as n becomes large, with period pi/n. So the integral is over x from 0 to pi, multiplied by this oscillating function.

Now, since n is going to infinity, the oscillations are getting extremely rapid, so maybe we can use the concept of the average value of the function over each period. I recall that for a rapidly oscillating function, the integral can be approximated by integrating the function against the average value of the oscillating part. So perhaps the x term can be treated as a constant over each small interval of length pi/n, and then multiplied by the average of |sin(2nx)| over that interval.

Let me recall that the average value of |sin(u)| over one period pi (since the period of |sin(u)| is pi). The average value is (2/pi). Because the integral of |sin(u)| over 0 to pi is 2, so the average is 2/pi. Therefore, if we can replace |sin(2nx)| by its average value 2/pi, then the integral becomes the integral of x*(2/pi) dx from 0 to pi, and then take the limit as n goes to infinity. But wait, does that work here?

Wait, but the problem is that x is also varying over the interval [0, pi], so maybe we need to be more careful. Let me think. If the oscillations are very rapid, then over each small interval, x is approximately constant, and the integral over that interval can be approximated by x (constant) times the integral of |sin(2nx)| over that interval. Then, since the integral of |sin(2nx)| over each period pi/n is 2/(2n) * 2 = 2/(2n)? Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s do it more carefully.

Let me make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let’s set t = 2n x. Then when x goes from 0 to pi, t goes from 0 to 2n pi. Then dx = dt/(2n). So substituting into the integral, we get:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \frac{t}{2n} |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Wait, no, hold on. Let me check that substitution again. If t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), so dx = dt/(2n). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \left( \frac{t}{2n} \right) |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \]

So the original integral is equal to (1/(4n²)) times the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ. Then, we need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/(4n²)) times that integral. So the problem reduces to understanding the growth of the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ as n becomes large.

Now, let me analyze the integral I(n) = ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt. Let&#x27;s consider splitting this integral into a sum over each period of |sin t|. Since |sin t| has period π, the interval from 0 to 2nπ can be divided into 2n intervals each of length π. So:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} ∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt

But in each interval [kπ, (k+1)π], |sin t| = |sin(t - kπ)|, which is sin(t - kπ) when k is even and sin(t - kπ) when k is odd, but since it&#x27;s absolute value, it&#x27;s just sin(t&#x27;) where t&#x27; = t - kπ. So in each interval, we can substitute t = kπ + u, where u goes from 0 to π. Then:

∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt = ∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) |sin(kπ + u)| du

But |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u| because sin(kπ + u) = sin u if k is even (since sin(kπ + u) = sin u when k even) and sin(kπ + u) = sin(u + π) = -sin u when k is odd, but absolute value makes it |sin u| in either case. Therefore, |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u|. But since u is from 0 to π, |sin u| = sin u. Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) sin u du

So substituting back:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} [ kπ ∫_{0}^{\pi} \sin u du + ∫_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u du ]

Let me compute those two integrals separately. First, ∫₀^π sin u du = 2, since the integral of sin u is -cos u, evaluated from 0 to pi: -cos pi + cos 0 = -(-1) + 1 = 2. Second, ∫₀^π u sin u du. That integral can be computed via integration by parts. Let me do that.

Let u = t, dv = sin t dt. Then du = dt, v = -cos t. So:

∫ t sin t dt = -t cos t + ∫ cos t dt = -t cos t + sin t + C

Evaluated from 0 to pi:

[-pi cos pi + sin pi] - [0 + sin 0] = -pi*(-1) + 0 - 0 = pi

So ∫₀^π u sin u du = pi

Therefore, each term in the sum becomes:

kπ * 2 + pi = 2kπ + pi

Therefore, I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} (2kπ + pi) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 2kπ + Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} pi

Let&#x27;s compute the two sums separately.

First sum: 2π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} k = 2π * [ (2n - 1)(2n) ) / 2 ] = 2π * [ (4n² - 2n) / 2 ] = 2π * (2n² - n ) = 4π n² - 2π n

Second sum: π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 1 = π * 2n = 2π n

Therefore, I(n) = 4π n² - 2π n + 2π n = 4π n²

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. The -2π n and +2π n cancel out, so I(n) = 4π n².

So going back to the original expression, the integral we had was (1/(4n²)) * I(n) = (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π

Wait, so the integral simplifies to π, and since we&#x27;re taking the limit as n approaches infinity, the limit is π? But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, first, substitution t = 2n x, so x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{2nπ} (t/(2n)) |sin t| * (dt/(2n)) = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt

Which we called I(n). Then we split I(n) into 2n intervals of length pi each, substituted each integral, found that each contributes 2kπ + pi, summed over k from 0 to 2n - 1, which gave 4π n².

Therefore, (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π. Therefore, the integral evaluates to π for any n? But that can&#x27;t be, because when n increases, the integral is oscillating? Wait, but according to this calculation, regardless of n, the integral is exactly π. So the limit as n approaches infinity is π? Hmm, but that seems counterintuitive because if you have x multiplied by |sin(2nx)|, which is oscillating rapidly, but the average value of |sin(2nx)| is 2/pi, so integrating x*(2/pi) from 0 to pi would give (2/pi)*(pi²/2) = pi. So that&#x27;s the same result. So in fact, the integral is equal to pi for all n? Wait, that seems strange.

Wait, no, the substitution led us to I(n) = 4π n², so when we multiply by 1/(4n²), it cancels out, leaving π. So does that mean that the integral is exactly equal to pi for any n? That seems incorrect because if n is 1, let&#x27;s test n=1. Compute the integral from 0 to pi of x |sin(2x)| dx. Let me compute that numerically.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute ∫₀^π x |sin(2x)| dx when n=1. Let&#x27;s split the integral into intervals where sin(2x) is positive and negative. Since sin(2x) is positive in [0, pi/2] and negative in [pi/2, pi]. So |sin(2x)| = sin(2x) in [0, pi/2] and -sin(2x) in [pi/2, pi].

So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{pi/2} x sin(2x) dx + ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx

But let&#x27;s compute these two integrals. Let me compute the first one: ∫ x sin(2x) dx. Integration by parts. Let u = x, dv = sin(2x) dx. Then du = dx, v = -1/2 cos(2x).

So ∫ x sin(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/2) ∫ cos(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x) + C

Evaluate from 0 to pi/2:

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

At 0: -0 + 0 = 0

So the first integral is pi/4.

Second integral: ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx = - ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x sin(2x) dx

Again, integration by parts:

Same as before, integral of x sin(2x) dx is -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x)

Evaluate from pi/2 to pi:

At pi: -pi/2 cos(2pi) + (1/4) sin(2pi) = -pi/2 * 1 + 0 = -pi/2

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

Therefore, the integral is [ -pi/2 - pi/4 ] = -3pi/4, but multiplied by the negative sign outside:

- [ -3pi/4 ] = 3pi/4

Therefore, the second integral is 3pi/4

So total integral for n=1 is pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi. Which matches our previous result. So the integral is indeed pi when n=1. Wait, so does that mean that the integral is always pi, regardless of n? Let&#x27;s test n=2.

Wait, for n=2, the integral is ∫₀^pi x |sin(4x)| dx. Let me check if that&#x27;s pi as well.

Again, split into intervals where sin(4x) is positive and negative. The zeros of sin(4x) are at x = k pi /4, so between 0 and pi, the zeros are at 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi. So intervals: [0, pi/4], [pi/4, pi/2], [pi/2, 3pi/4], [3pi/4, pi]. The sign alternates each interval.

But computing this integral would be tedious, but according to our general formula, it should also equal pi. Let me see.

But perhaps there&#x27;s a pattern here. If the integral equals pi for n=1 and n=2, then maybe for all n, the integral is equal to pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi. But that seems counterintuitive at first, but maybe it&#x27;s correct.

Wait, the reasoning via substitution gave us that for any n, the integral equals pi. So even before taking the limit, the integral is pi. Therefore, the limit is pi.

But that seems surprising. Let me check with another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the average of |sin(2nx)| over the interval. Since |sin(2nx)| has average value 2/pi over each period. Then, if we can write the integral as ∫₀^pi x * |sin(2nx)| dx ≈ ∫₀^pi x * (2/pi) dx = (2/pi) * (pi² / 2) = pi. So that also gives pi.

But this is only an approximation when n is large, right? But according to the substitution method, it&#x27;s exact for any n. So maybe the integral is exactly pi for any n. But then why does the problem ask for the limit as n approaches infinity? If the integral is pi for all n, then the limit is pi. But maybe the problem is set in such a way that regardless of n, the integral is pi. Wait, but how is that possible?

Wait, when we did the substitution, we saw that the integral is exactly pi, regardless of n. So even when n is 1, 2, 3, etc., the integral is exactly pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is just pi. So the answer is pi.

But that seems too straightforward. Maybe the problem was designed to test if we realize that despite the oscillating function, the integral evaluates to the same value for any n. But why is that?

Let me verify for n=1/2. Wait, n is an integer going to infinity, but if we take n=1/2, which is not an integer, but just to see. Wait, no, n is a positive integer here. But in any case, the substitution works for any positive real n, but in the problem, n is approaching infinity through integer values. However, the key point is that the integral is always pi. So regardless of n, the integral is pi, so the limit is pi.

But that seems strange. Let me check n=1 case again. Wait, when n=1, the integral is pi. When n=2, the integral is pi. Wait, so is this a general result? For any integer n, ∫₀^pi x |sin(2n x)| dx = pi. How is that possible?

Wait, but if we make substitution t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). The integral becomes (1/(2n)) ∫₀^{2n pi} [t/(2n)] |sin t| dt = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2n pi} t |sin t| dt. Then, according to our previous calculation, that integral is 4 pi n², so (1/(4n²)) * 4 pi n² = pi. So yes, this shows that for any n, the integral equals pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi.

So the answer is pi. Therefore, the box answer is \boxed{\pi}

But let me just verify once more with n=1. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx, we saw earlier that it&#x27;s pi. Let me compute numerically for n=1. Let&#x27;s use approximate values.

The integral for n=1 was pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi, which is approximately 3.1416. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx numerically, say using trapezoidal rule with a few intervals, would I get roughly pi?

Let&#x27;s try. Divide [0, pi] into four intervals: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi.

Compute x |sin(2x)| at these points:

At 0: 0 * |0| = 0

At pi/4: (pi/4) * |sin(pi/2)| = (pi/4)*1 ≈ 0.7854

At pi/2: (pi/2)*|sin(pi)| = (pi/2)*0 = 0

At 3pi/4: (3pi/4)*|sin(3pi/2)| = (3pi/4)*1 ≈ 2.3562

At pi: pi * |sin(2pi)| = pi * 0 = 0

Using trapezoidal rule:

Approximate integral ≈ (pi/4)/2 [0 + 2*(0.7854) + 2*0 + 2*(2.3562) + 0] = (pi/8) [0 + 1.5708 + 0 + 4.7124 + 0] = (pi/8)*(6.2832) ≈ (pi/8)*(2pi) ≈ (pi^2)/4 ≈ 2.4674

But pi is approximately 3.1416, so this is a rough approximation. The trapezoidal rule with four intervals isn&#x27;t very accurate here because the function is oscillating. But if we take more intervals, it would approach pi. For example, if we take n=1 and compute the integral using more intervals, it should approach pi.

Alternatively, trust the analytical result which shows that the integral is exactly pi for any n. Therefore, the limit is pi.

Wait, this is fascinating. So the integral ∫₀^pi x |sin(2nx)| dx is equal to pi for any positive integer n, hence the limit as n approaches infinity is also pi. Therefore, the answer is pi. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\pi}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\pi}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\), we start by considering the integral involving the rapidly oscillating function \( |\sin(2nx)| \).

First, we make a substitution \( t = 2nx \), which transforms the integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx = \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt
\]

Next, we analyze the integral \( \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \). By splitting this integral into intervals of length \( \pi \), we recognize that each interval contributes:
\[
\int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du
\]

This integral can be decomposed and evaluated using integration by parts:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du = k\pi \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du + \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du
\]

The results of these integrals are:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du = \pi
\]

Summing these contributions over all intervals from \( k = 0 \) to \( 2n - 1 \), we find:
\[
\int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} (2k\pi + \pi) = 4\pi n^2
\]

Substituting back into the original integral, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{4n^2} \cdot 4\pi n^2 = \pi
\]

Thus, the integral \(\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\) evaluates to \(\pi\) for any \( n \). Therefore, the limit as \( n \to \infty \) is:
\[
\boxed{\pi}

Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of the integral from 0 to pi of x times the absolute value of sin(2nx) dx. Hmm. Let me write that down properly to visualize it better.

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx \]

Okay, so the integral involves x multiplied by the absolute value of sin(2nx), and we need to find its limit as n becomes very large. First, I remember that integrals involving rapidly oscillating functions like sine or cosine can sometimes be simplified using methods like the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma or by considering the average value over the oscillations. But here, there&#x27;s an absolute value, which complicates things a bit because the absolute value of sine is a non-negative function with period pi/n instead of 2pi/n. Wait, let me check that.

The function sin(2nx) has a period of pi/n because the period of sin(kx) is 2pi/k, so here k is 2n, so period is 2pi/(2n) = pi/n. But when we take the absolute value, the period halves, so the period of |sin(2nx)| is pi/(2n). So each &quot;hill&quot; of the sine wave becomes a hump from 0 to pi/(2n), then another hump from pi/(2n) to pi/n, etc. So the function |sin(2nx)| oscillates very rapidly as n becomes large, with period pi/n. So the integral is over x from 0 to pi, multiplied by this oscillating function.

Now, since n is going to infinity, the oscillations are getting extremely rapid, so maybe we can use the concept of the average value of the function over each period. I recall that for a rapidly oscillating function, the integral can be approximated by integrating the function against the average value of the oscillating part. So perhaps the x term can be treated as a constant over each small interval of length pi/n, and then multiplied by the average of |sin(2nx)| over that interval.

Let me recall that the average value of |sin(u)| over one period pi (since the period of |sin(u)| is pi). The average value is (2/pi). Because the integral of |sin(u)| over 0 to pi is 2, so the average is 2/pi. Therefore, if we can replace |sin(2nx)| by its average value 2/pi, then the integral becomes the integral of x*(2/pi) dx from 0 to pi, and then take the limit as n goes to infinity. But wait, does that work here?

Wait, but the problem is that x is also varying over the interval [0, pi], so maybe we need to be more careful. Let me think. If the oscillations are very rapid, then over each small interval, x is approximately constant, and the integral over that interval can be approximated by x (constant) times the integral of |sin(2nx)| over that interval. Then, since the integral of |sin(2nx)| over each period pi/n is 2/(2n) * 2 = 2/(2n)? Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s do it more carefully.

Let me make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let’s set t = 2n x. Then when x goes from 0 to pi, t goes from 0 to 2n pi. Then dx = dt/(2n). So substituting into the integral, we get:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \frac{t}{2n} |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Wait, no, hold on. Let me check that substitution again. If t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), so dx = dt/(2n). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \left( \frac{t}{2n} \right) |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \]

So the original integral is equal to (1/(4n²)) times the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ. Then, we need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/(4n²)) times that integral. So the problem reduces to understanding the growth of the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ as n becomes large.

Now, let me analyze the integral I(n) = ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt. Let&#x27;s consider splitting this integral into a sum over each period of |sin t|. Since |sin t| has period π, the interval from 0 to 2nπ can be divided into 2n intervals each of length π. So:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} ∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt

But in each interval [kπ, (k+1)π], |sin t| = |sin(t - kπ)|, which is sin(t - kπ) when k is even and sin(t - kπ) when k is odd, but since it&#x27;s absolute value, it&#x27;s just sin(t&#x27;) where t&#x27; = t - kπ. So in each interval, we can substitute t = kπ + u, where u goes from 0 to π. Then:

∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt = ∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) |sin(kπ + u)| du

But |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u| because sin(kπ + u) = sin u if k is even (since sin(kπ + u) = sin u when k even) and sin(kπ + u) = sin(u + π) = -sin u when k is odd, but absolute value makes it |sin u| in either case. Therefore, |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u|. But since u is from 0 to π, |sin u| = sin u. Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) sin u du

So substituting back:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} [ kπ ∫_{0}^{\pi} \sin u du + ∫_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u du ]

Let me compute those two integrals separately. First, ∫₀^π sin u du = 2, since the integral of sin u is -cos u, evaluated from 0 to pi: -cos pi + cos 0 = -(-1) + 1 = 2. Second, ∫₀^π u sin u du. That integral can be computed via integration by parts. Let me do that.

Let u = t, dv = sin t dt. Then du = dt, v = -cos t. So:

∫ t sin t dt = -t cos t + ∫ cos t dt = -t cos t + sin t + C

Evaluated from 0 to pi:

[-pi cos pi + sin pi] - [0 + sin 0] = -pi*(-1) + 0 - 0 = pi

So ∫₀^π u sin u du = pi

Therefore, each term in the sum becomes:

kπ * 2 + pi = 2kπ + pi

Therefore, I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} (2kπ + pi) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 2kπ + Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} pi

Let&#x27;s compute the two sums separately.

First sum: 2π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} k = 2π * [ (2n - 1)(2n) ) / 2 ] = 2π * [ (4n² - 2n) / 2 ] = 2π * (2n² - n ) = 4π n² - 2π n

Second sum: π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 1 = π * 2n = 2π n

Therefore, I(n) = 4π n² - 2π n + 2π n = 4π n²

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. The -2π n and +2π n cancel out, so I(n) = 4π n².

So going back to the original expression, the integral we had was (1/(4n²)) * I(n) = (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π

Wait, so the integral simplifies to π, and since we&#x27;re taking the limit as n approaches infinity, the limit is π? But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, first, substitution t = 2n x, so x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{2nπ} (t/(2n)) |sin t| * (dt/(2n)) = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt

Which we called I(n). Then we split I(n) into 2n intervals of length pi each, substituted each integral, found that each contributes 2kπ + pi, summed over k from 0 to 2n - 1, which gave 4π n².

Therefore, (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π. Therefore, the integral evaluates to π for any n? But that can&#x27;t be, because when n increases, the integral is oscillating? Wait, but according to this calculation, regardless of n, the integral is exactly π. So the limit as n approaches infinity is π? Hmm, but that seems counterintuitive because if you have x multiplied by |sin(2nx)|, which is oscillating rapidly, but the average value of |sin(2nx)| is 2/pi, so integrating x*(2/pi) from 0 to pi would give (2/pi)*(pi²/2) = pi. So that&#x27;s the same result. So in fact, the integral is equal to pi for all n? Wait, that seems strange.

Wait, no, the substitution led us to I(n) = 4π n², so when we multiply by 1/(4n²), it cancels out, leaving π. So does that mean that the integral is exactly equal to pi for any n? That seems incorrect because if n is 1, let&#x27;s test n=1. Compute the integral from 0 to pi of x |sin(2x)| dx. Let me compute that numerically.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute ∫₀^π x |sin(2x)| dx when n=1. Let&#x27;s split the integral into intervals where sin(2x) is positive and negative. Since sin(2x) is positive in [0, pi/2] and negative in [pi/2, pi]. So |sin(2x)| = sin(2x) in [0, pi/2] and -sin(2x) in [pi/2, pi].

So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{pi/2} x sin(2x) dx + ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx

But let&#x27;s compute these two integrals. Let me compute the first one: ∫ x sin(2x) dx. Integration by parts. Let u = x, dv = sin(2x) dx. Then du = dx, v = -1/2 cos(2x).

So ∫ x sin(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/2) ∫ cos(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x) + C

Evaluate from 0 to pi/2:

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

At 0: -0 + 0 = 0

So the first integral is pi/4.

Second integral: ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx = - ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x sin(2x) dx

Again, integration by parts:

Same as before, integral of x sin(2x) dx is -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x)

Evaluate from pi/2 to pi:

At pi: -pi/2 cos(2pi) + (1/4) sin(2pi) = -pi/2 * 1 + 0 = -pi/2

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

Therefore, the integral is [ -pi/2 - pi/4 ] = -3pi/4, but multiplied by the negative sign outside:

- [ -3pi/4 ] = 3pi/4

Therefore, the second integral is 3pi/4

So total integral for n=1 is pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi. Which matches our previous result. So the integral is indeed pi when n=1. Wait, so does that mean that the integral is always pi, regardless of n? Let&#x27;s test n=2.

Wait, for n=2, the integral is ∫₀^pi x |sin(4x)| dx. Let me check if that&#x27;s pi as well.

Again, split into intervals where sin(4x) is positive and negative. The zeros of sin(4x) are at x = k pi /4, so between 0 and pi, the zeros are at 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi. So intervals: [0, pi/4], [pi/4, pi/2], [pi/2, 3pi/4], [3pi/4, pi]. The sign alternates each interval.

But computing this integral would be tedious, but according to our general formula, it should also equal pi. Let me see.

But perhaps there&#x27;s a pattern here. If the integral equals pi for n=1 and n=2, then maybe for all n, the integral is equal to pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi. But that seems counterintuitive at first, but maybe it&#x27;s correct.

Wait, the reasoning via substitution gave us that for any n, the integral equals pi. So even before taking the limit, the integral is pi. Therefore, the limit is pi.

But that seems surprising. Let me check with another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the average of |sin(2nx)| over the interval. Since |sin(2nx)| has average value 2/pi over each period. Then, if we can write the integral as ∫₀^pi x * |sin(2nx)| dx ≈ ∫₀^pi x * (2/pi) dx = (2/pi) * (pi² / 2) = pi. So that also gives pi.

But this is only an approximation when n is large, right? But according to the substitution method, it&#x27;s exact for any n. So maybe the integral is exactly pi for any n. But then why does the problem ask for the limit as n approaches infinity? If the integral is pi for all n, then the limit is pi. But maybe the problem is set in such a way that regardless of n, the integral is pi. Wait, but how is that possible?

Wait, when we did the substitution, we saw that the integral is exactly pi, regardless of n. So even when n is 1, 2, 3, etc., the integral is exactly pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is just pi. So the answer is pi.

But that seems too straightforward. Maybe the problem was designed to test if we realize that despite the oscillating function, the integral evaluates to the same value for any n. But why is that?

Let me verify for n=1/2. Wait, n is an integer going to infinity, but if we take n=1/2, which is not an integer, but just to see. Wait, no, n is a positive integer here. But in any case, the substitution works for any positive real n, but in the problem, n is approaching infinity through integer values. However, the key point is that the integral is always pi. So regardless of n, the integral is pi, so the limit is pi.

But that seems strange. Let me check n=1 case again. Wait, when n=1, the integral is pi. When n=2, the integral is pi. Wait, so is this a general result? For any integer n, ∫₀^pi x |sin(2n x)| dx = pi. How is that possible?

Wait, but if we make substitution t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). The integral becomes (1/(2n)) ∫₀^{2n pi} [t/(2n)] |sin t| dt = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2n pi} t |sin t| dt. Then, according to our previous calculation, that integral is 4 pi n², so (1/(4n²)) * 4 pi n² = pi. So yes, this shows that for any n, the integral equals pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi.

So the answer is pi. Therefore, the box answer is \boxed{\pi}

Compute x |sin(2x)| at these points:

At pi/4: (pi/4) * |sin(pi/2)| = (pi/4)*1 ≈ 0.7854

At pi/2: (pi/2)*|sin(pi)| = (pi/2)*0 = 0

At 3pi/4: (3pi/4)*|sin(3pi/2)| = (3pi/4)*1 ≈ 2.3562

At pi: pi * |sin(2pi)| = pi * 0 = 0

Using trapezoidal rule:

Approximate integral ≈ (pi/4)/2 [0 + 2*(0.7854) + 2*0 + 2*(2.3562) + 0] = (pi/8) [0 + 1.5708 + 0 + 4.7124 + 0] = (pi/8)*(6.2832) ≈ (pi/8)*(2pi) ≈ (pi^2)/4 ≈ 2.4674

But pi is approximately 3.1416, so this is a rough approximation. The trapezoidal rule with four intervals isn&#x27;t very accurate here because the function is oscillating. But if we take more intervals, it would approach pi. For example, if we take n=1 and compute the integral using more intervals, it should approach pi.

First, we make a substitution \( t = 2nx \), which transforms the integral:

\int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du
\]

This integral can be decomposed and evaluated using integration by parts:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du = k\pi \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du + \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du
\]

The results of these integrals are:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du = \pi
\]

Summing these contributions over all intervals from \( k = 0 \) to \( 2n - 1 \), we find:
\[
\int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} (2k\pi + \pi) = 4\pi n^2
\]

Substituting back into the original integral, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{4n^2} \cdot 4\pi n^2 = \pi
\]

Thus, the integral \(\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\) evaluates to \(\pi\) for any \( n \). Therefore, the limit as \( n \to \infty \) is:

So each &quot;hill&quot; of the sine wave becomes a hump from 0 to pi/(2n), then another hump from pi/(2n) to pi/n, etc. So the function |sin(2nx)| oscillates very rapidly as n becomes large, with period pi/n. So the integral is over x from 0 to pi, multiplied by this oscillating function.

Now, since n is going to infinity, the oscillations are getting extremely rapid, so maybe we can use the concept of the average value of the function over each period. I recall that for a rapidly oscillating function, the integral can be approximated by integrating the function against the average value of the oscillating part. So perhaps the x term can be treated as a constant over each small interval of length pi/n, and then multiplied by the average of |sin(2nx)| over that interval.

Let me recall that the average value of |sin(u)| over one period pi (since the period of |sin(u)| is pi). The average value is (2/pi). Because the integral of |sin(u)| over 0 to pi is 2, so the average is 2/pi. Therefore, if we can replace |sin(2nx)| by its average value 2/pi, then the integral becomes the integral of x*(2/pi) dx from 0 to pi, and then take the limit as n goes to infinity. But wait, does that work here?

Wait, but the problem is that x is also varying over the interval [0, pi], so maybe we need to be more careful. Let me think. If the oscillations are very rapid, then over each small interval, x is approximately constant, and the integral over that interval can be approximated by x (constant) times the integral of |sin(2nx)| over that interval. Then, since the integral of |sin(2nx)| over each period pi/n is 2/(2n) * 2 = 2/(2n)? Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s do it more carefully.

Let me make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let’s set t = 2n x. Then when x goes from 0 to pi, t goes from 0 to 2n pi. Then dx = dt/(2n). So substituting into the integral, we get:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \frac{t}{2n} |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Wait, no, hold on. Let me check that substitution again. If t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), so dx = dt/(2n). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \left( \frac{t}{2n} \right) |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \]

So the original integral is equal to (1/(4n²)) times the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ. Then, we need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/(4n²)) times that integral. So the problem reduces to understanding the growth of the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ as n becomes large.

Now, let me analyze the integral I(n) = ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt. Let&#x27;s consider splitting this integral into a sum over each period of |sin t|. Since |sin t| has period π, the interval from 0 to 2nπ can be divided into 2n intervals each of length π. So:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} ∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt

But in each interval [kπ, (k+1)π], |sin t| = |sin(t - kπ)|, which is sin(t - kπ) when k is even and sin(t - kπ) when k is odd, but since it&#x27;s absolute value, it&#x27;s just sin(t&#x27;) where t&#x27; = t - kπ. So in each interval, we can substitute t = kπ + u, where u goes from 0 to π. Then:

∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt = ∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) |sin(kπ + u)| du

But |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u| because sin(kπ + u) = sin u if k is even (since sin(kπ + u) = sin u when k even) and sin(kπ + u) = sin(u + π) = -sin u when k is odd, but absolute value makes it |sin u| in either case. Therefore, |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u|. But since u is from 0 to π, |sin u| = sin u. Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) sin u du

So substituting back:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} [ kπ ∫_{0}^{\pi} \sin u du + ∫_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u du ]

Let me compute those two integrals separately. First, ∫₀^π sin u du = 2, since the integral of sin u is -cos u, evaluated from 0 to pi: -cos pi + cos 0 = -(-1) + 1 = 2. Second, ∫₀^π u sin u du. That integral can be computed via integration by parts. Let me do that.

Let u = t, dv = sin t dt. Then du = dt, v = -cos t. So:

∫ t sin t dt = -t cos t + ∫ cos t dt = -t cos t + sin t + C

Evaluated from 0 to pi:

[-pi cos pi + sin pi] - [0 + sin 0] = -pi*(-1) + 0 - 0 = pi

So ∫₀^π u sin u du = pi

Therefore, each term in the sum becomes:

kπ * 2 + pi = 2kπ + pi

Therefore, I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} (2kπ + pi) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 2kπ + Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} pi

Let&#x27;s compute the two sums separately.

First sum: 2π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} k = 2π * [ (2n - 1)(2n) ) / 2 ] = 2π * [ (4n² - 2n) / 2 ] = 2π * (2n² - n ) = 4π n² - 2π n

Second sum: π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 1 = π * 2n = 2π n

Therefore, I(n) = 4π n² - 2π n + 2π n = 4π n²

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. The -2π n and +2π n cancel out, so I(n) = 4π n².

So going back to the original expression, the integral we had was (1/(4n²)) * I(n) = (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π

Wait, so the integral simplifies to π, and since we&#x27;re taking the limit as n approaches infinity, the limit is π? But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, first, substitution t = 2n x, so x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{2nπ} (t/(2n)) |sin t| * (dt/(2n)) = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt

Which we called I(n). Then we split I(n) into 2n intervals of length pi each, substituted each integral, found that each contributes 2kπ + pi, summed over k from 0 to 2n - 1, which gave 4π n².

Therefore, (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π. Therefore, the integral evaluates to π for any n? But that can&#x27;t be, because when n increases, the integral is oscillating? Wait, but according to this calculation, regardless of n, the integral is exactly π. So the limit as n approaches infinity is π? Hmm, but that seems counterintuitive because if you have x multiplied by |sin(2nx)|, which is oscillating rapidly, but the average value of |sin(2nx)| is 2/pi, so integrating x*(2/pi) from 0 to pi would give (2/pi)*(pi²/2) = pi. So that&#x27;s the same result. So in fact, the integral is equal to pi for all n? Wait, that seems strange.

Wait, no, the substitution led us to I(n) = 4π n², so when we multiply by 1/(4n²), it cancels out, leaving π. So does that mean that the integral is exactly equal to pi for any n? That seems incorrect because if n is 1, let&#x27;s test n=1. Compute the integral from 0 to pi of x |sin(2x)| dx. Let me compute that numerically.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute ∫₀^π x |sin(2x)| dx when n=1. Let&#x27;s split the integral into intervals where sin(2x) is positive and negative. Since sin(2x) is positive in [0, pi/2] and negative in [pi/2, pi]. So |sin(2x)| = sin(2x) in [0, pi/2] and -sin(2x) in [pi/2, pi].

So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{pi/2} x sin(2x) dx + ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx

But let&#x27;s compute these two integrals. Let me compute the first one: ∫ x sin(2x) dx. Integration by parts. Let u = x, dv = sin(2x) dx. Then du = dx, v = -1/2 cos(2x).

So ∫ x sin(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/2) ∫ cos(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x) + C

Evaluate from 0 to pi/2:

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

At 0: -0 + 0 = 0

So the first integral is pi/4.

Second integral: ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx = - ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x sin(2x) dx

Again, integration by parts:

Same as before, integral of x sin(2x) dx is -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x)

Evaluate from pi/2 to pi:

At pi: -pi/2 cos(2pi) + (1/4) sin(2pi) = -pi/2 * 1 + 0 = -pi/2

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

Therefore, the integral is [ -pi/2 - pi/4 ] = -3pi/4, but multiplied by the negative sign outside:

- [ -3pi/4 ] = 3pi/4

Therefore, the second integral is 3pi/4

So total integral for n=1 is pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi. Which matches our previous result. So the integral is indeed pi when n=1. Wait, so does that mean that the integral is always pi, regardless of n? Let&#x27;s test n=2.

Wait, for n=2, the integral is ∫₀^pi x |sin(4x)| dx. Let me check if that&#x27;s pi as well.

Again, split into intervals where sin(4x) is positive and negative. The zeros of sin(4x) are at x = k pi /4, so between 0 and pi, the zeros are at 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi. So intervals: [0, pi/4], [pi/4, pi/2], [pi/2, 3pi/4], [3pi/4, pi]. The sign alternates each interval.

But computing this integral would be tedious, but according to our general formula, it should also equal pi. Let me see.

But perhaps there&#x27;s a pattern here. If the integral equals pi for n=1 and n=2, then maybe for all n, the integral is equal to pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi. But that seems counterintuitive at first, but maybe it&#x27;s correct.

Wait, the reasoning via substitution gave us that for any n, the integral equals pi. So even before taking the limit, the integral is pi. Therefore, the limit is pi.

But that seems surprising. Let me check with another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the average of |sin(2nx)| over the interval. Since |sin(2nx)| has average value 2/pi over each period. Then, if we can write the integral as ∫₀^pi x * |sin(2nx)| dx ≈ ∫₀^pi x * (2/pi) dx = (2/pi) * (pi² / 2) = pi. So that also gives pi.

But this is only an approximation when n is large, right? But according to the substitution method, it&#x27;s exact for any n. So maybe the integral is exactly pi for any n. But then why does the problem ask for the limit as n approaches infinity? If the integral is pi for all n, then the limit is pi. But maybe the problem is set in such a way that regardless of n, the integral is pi. Wait, but how is that possible?

Wait, when we did the substitution, we saw that the integral is exactly pi, regardless of n. So even when n is 1, 2, 3, etc., the integral is exactly pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is just pi. So the answer is pi.

But that seems too straightforward. Maybe the problem was designed to test if we realize that despite the oscillating function, the integral evaluates to the same value for any n. But why is that?

Let me verify for n=1/2. Wait, n is an integer going to infinity, but if we take n=1/2, which is not an integer, but just to see. Wait, no, n is a positive integer here. But in any case, the substitution works for any positive real n, but in the problem, n is approaching infinity through integer values. However, the key point is that the integral is always pi. So regardless of n, the integral is pi, so the limit is pi.

But that seems strange. Let me check n=1 case again. Wait, when n=1, the integral is pi. When n=2, the integral is pi. Wait, so is this a general result? For any integer n, ∫₀^pi x |sin(2n x)| dx = pi. How is that possible?

Wait, but if we make substitution t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). The integral becomes (1/(2n)) ∫₀^{2n pi} [t/(2n)] |sin t| dt = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2n pi} t |sin t| dt. Then, according to our previous calculation, that integral is 4 pi n², so (1/(4n²)) * 4 pi n² = pi. So yes, this shows that for any n, the integral equals pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi.

So the answer is pi. Therefore, the box answer is \boxed{\pi}

But let me just verify once more with n=1. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx, we saw earlier that it&#x27;s pi. Let me compute numerically for n=1. Let&#x27;s use approximate values.

The integral for n=1 was pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi, which is approximately 3.1416. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx numerically, say using trapezoidal rule with a few intervals, would I get roughly pi?

Let&#x27;s try. Divide [0, pi] into four intervals: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi.

Compute x |sin(2x)| at these points:

At 0: 0 * |0| = 0

At pi/4: (pi/4) * |sin(pi/2)| = (pi/4)*1 ≈ 0.7854

At pi/2: (pi/2)*|sin(pi)| = (pi/2)*0 = 0

At 3pi/4: (3pi/4)*|sin(3pi/2)| = (3pi/4)*1 ≈ 2.3562

At pi: pi * |sin(2pi)| = pi * 0 = 0

Using trapezoidal rule:

Approximate integral ≈ (pi/4)/2 [0 + 2*(0.7854) + 2*0 + 2*(2.3562) + 0] = (pi/8) [0 + 1.5708 + 0 + 4.7124 + 0] = (pi/8)*(6.2832) ≈ (pi/8)*(2pi) ≈ (pi^2)/4 ≈ 2.4674

But pi is approximately 3.1416, so this is a rough approximation. The trapezoidal rule with four intervals isn&#x27;t very accurate here because the function is oscillating. But if we take more intervals, it would approach pi. For example, if we take n=1 and compute the integral using more intervals, it should approach pi.

Alternatively, trust the analytical result which shows that the integral is exactly pi for any n. Therefore, the limit is pi.

Wait, this is fascinating. So the integral ∫₀^pi x |sin(2nx)| dx is equal to pi for any positive integer n, hence the limit as n approaches infinity is also pi. Therefore, the answer is pi. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\pi}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\pi}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\), we start by considering the integral involving the rapidly oscillating function \( |\sin(2nx)| \).

First, we make a substitution \( t = 2nx \), which transforms the integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx = \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt
\]

Next, we analyze the integral \( \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \). By splitting this integral into intervals of length \( \pi \), we recognize that each interval contributes:
\[
\int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du
\]

This integral can be decomposed and evaluated using integration by parts:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du = k\pi \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du + \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du
\]

The results of these integrals are:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du = \pi
\]

Summing these contributions over all intervals from \( k = 0 \) to \( 2n - 1 \), we find:
\[
\int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} (2k\pi + \pi) = 4\pi n^2
\]

Substituting back into the original integral, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{4n^2} \cdot 4\pi n^2 = \pi
\]

Thus, the integral \(\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\) evaluates to \(\pi\) for any \( n \). Therefore, the limit as \( n \to \infty \) is:
\[
\boxed{\pi}

Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of the integral from 0 to pi of x times the absolute value of sin(2nx) dx. Hmm. Let me write that down properly to visualize it better.

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx \]

Okay, so the integral involves x multiplied by the absolute value of sin(2nx), and we need to find its limit as n becomes very large. First, I remember that integrals involving rapidly oscillating functions like sine or cosine can sometimes be simplified using methods like the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma or by considering the average value over the oscillations. But here, there&#x27;s an absolute value, which complicates things a bit because the absolute value of sine is a non-negative function with period pi/n instead of 2pi/n. Wait, let me check that.

The function sin(2nx) has a period of pi/n because the period of sin(kx) is 2pi/k, so here k is 2n, so period is 2pi/(2n) = pi/n. But when we take the absolute value, the period halves, so the period of |sin(2nx)| is pi/(2n). So each &quot;hill&quot; of the sine wave becomes a hump from 0 to pi/(2n), then another hump from pi/(2n) to pi/n, etc. So the function |sin(2nx)| oscillates very rapidly as n becomes large, with period pi/n. So the integral is over x from 0 to pi, multiplied by this oscillating function.

Now, since n is going to infinity, the oscillations are getting extremely rapid, so maybe we can use the concept of the average value of the function over each period. I recall that for a rapidly oscillating function, the integral can be approximated by integrating the function against the average value of the oscillating part. So perhaps the x term can be treated as a constant over each small interval of length pi/n, and then multiplied by the average of |sin(2nx)| over that interval.

Let me recall that the average value of |sin(u)| over one period pi (since the period of |sin(u)| is pi). The average value is (2/pi). Because the integral of |sin(u)| over 0 to pi is 2, so the average is 2/pi. Therefore, if we can replace |sin(2nx)| by its average value 2/pi, then the integral becomes the integral of x*(2/pi) dx from 0 to pi, and then take the limit as n goes to infinity. But wait, does that work here?

Wait, but the problem is that x is also varying over the interval [0, pi], so maybe we need to be more careful. Let me think. If the oscillations are very rapid, then over each small interval, x is approximately constant, and the integral over that interval can be approximated by x (constant) times the integral of |sin(2nx)| over that interval. Then, since the integral of |sin(2nx)| over each period pi/n is 2/(2n) * 2 = 2/(2n)? Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s do it more carefully.

Let me make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let’s set t = 2n x. Then when x goes from 0 to pi, t goes from 0 to 2n pi. Then dx = dt/(2n). So substituting into the integral, we get:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \frac{t}{2n} |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Wait, no, hold on. Let me check that substitution again. If t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), so dx = dt/(2n). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \left( \frac{t}{2n} \right) |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \]

So the original integral is equal to (1/(4n²)) times the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ. Then, we need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/(4n²)) times that integral. So the problem reduces to understanding the growth of the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ as n becomes large.

Now, let me analyze the integral I(n) = ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt. Let&#x27;s consider splitting this integral into a sum over each period of |sin t|. Since |sin t| has period π, the interval from 0 to 2nπ can be divided into 2n intervals each of length π. So:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} ∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt

But in each interval [kπ, (k+1)π], |sin t| = |sin(t - kπ)|, which is sin(t - kπ) when k is even and sin(t - kπ) when k is odd, but since it&#x27;s absolute value, it&#x27;s just sin(t&#x27;) where t&#x27; = t - kπ. So in each interval, we can substitute t = kπ + u, where u goes from 0 to π. Then:

∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt = ∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) |sin(kπ + u)| du

But |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u| because sin(kπ + u) = sin u if k is even (since sin(kπ + u) = sin u when k even) and sin(kπ + u) = sin(u + π) = -sin u when k is odd, but absolute value makes it |sin u| in either case. Therefore, |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u|. But since u is from 0 to π, |sin u| = sin u. Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) sin u du

So substituting back:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} [ kπ ∫_{0}^{\pi} \sin u du + ∫_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u du ]

Let me compute those two integrals separately. First, ∫₀^π sin u du = 2, since the integral of sin u is -cos u, evaluated from 0 to pi: -cos pi + cos 0 = -(-1) + 1 = 2. Second, ∫₀^π u sin u du. That integral can be computed via integration by parts. Let me do that.

Let u = t, dv = sin t dt. Then du = dt, v = -cos t. So:

∫ t sin t dt = -t cos t + ∫ cos t dt = -t cos t + sin t + C

Evaluated from 0 to pi:

[-pi cos pi + sin pi] - [0 + sin 0] = -pi*(-1) + 0 - 0 = pi

So ∫₀^π u sin u du = pi

Therefore, each term in the sum becomes:

kπ * 2 + pi = 2kπ + pi

Therefore, I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} (2kπ + pi) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 2kπ + Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} pi

Let&#x27;s compute the two sums separately.

First sum: 2π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} k = 2π * [ (2n - 1)(2n) ) / 2 ] = 2π * [ (4n² - 2n) / 2 ] = 2π * (2n² - n ) = 4π n² - 2π n

Second sum: π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 1 = π * 2n = 2π n

Therefore, I(n) = 4π n² - 2π n + 2π n = 4π n²

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. The -2π n and +2π n cancel out, so I(n) = 4π n².

So going back to the original expression, the integral we had was (1/(4n²)) * I(n) = (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π

Wait, so the integral simplifies to π, and since we&#x27;re taking the limit as n approaches infinity, the limit is π? But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, first, substitution t = 2n x, so x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{2nπ} (t/(2n)) |sin t| * (dt/(2n)) = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt

Which we called I(n). Then we split I(n) into 2n intervals of length pi each, substituted each integral, found that each contributes 2kπ + pi, summed over k from 0 to 2n - 1, which gave 4π n².

Therefore, (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π. Therefore, the integral evaluates to π for any n? But that can&#x27;t be, because when n increases, the integral is oscillating? Wait, but according to this calculation, regardless of n, the integral is exactly π. So the limit as n approaches infinity is π? Hmm, but that seems counterintuitive because if you have x multiplied by |sin(2nx)|, which is oscillating rapidly, but the average value of |sin(2nx)| is 2/pi, so integrating x*(2/pi) from 0 to pi would give (2/pi)*(pi²/2) = pi. So that&#x27;s the same result. So in fact, the integral is equal to pi for all n? Wait, that seems strange.

Wait, no, the substitution led us to I(n) = 4π n², so when we multiply by 1/(4n²), it cancels out, leaving π. So does that mean that the integral is exactly equal to pi for any n? That seems incorrect because if n is 1, let&#x27;s test n=1. Compute the integral from 0 to pi of x |sin(2x)| dx. Let me compute that numerically.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute ∫₀^π x |sin(2x)| dx when n=1. Let&#x27;s split the integral into intervals where sin(2x) is positive and negative. Since sin(2x) is positive in [0, pi/2] and negative in [pi/2, pi]. So |sin(2x)| = sin(2x) in [0, pi/2] and -sin(2x) in [pi/2, pi].

So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{pi/2} x sin(2x) dx + ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx

But let&#x27;s compute these two integrals. Let me compute the first one: ∫ x sin(2x) dx. Integration by parts. Let u = x, dv = sin(2x) dx. Then du = dx, v = -1/2 cos(2x).

So ∫ x sin(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/2) ∫ cos(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x) + C

Evaluate from 0 to pi/2:

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

At 0: -0 + 0 = 0

So the first integral is pi/4.

Second integral: ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx = - ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x sin(2x) dx

Again, integration by parts:

Same as before, integral of x sin(2x) dx is -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x)

Evaluate from pi/2 to pi:

At pi: -pi/2 cos(2pi) + (1/4) sin(2pi) = -pi/2 * 1 + 0 = -pi/2

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

Therefore, the integral is [ -pi/2 - pi/4 ] = -3pi/4, but multiplied by the negative sign outside:

- [ -3pi/4 ] = 3pi/4

Therefore, the second integral is 3pi/4

So total integral for n=1 is pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi. Which matches our previous result. So the integral is indeed pi when n=1. Wait, so does that mean that the integral is always pi, regardless of n? Let&#x27;s test n=2.

Wait, for n=2, the integral is ∫₀^pi x |sin(4x)| dx. Let me check if that&#x27;s pi as well.

Again, split into intervals where sin(4x) is positive and negative. The zeros of sin(4x) are at x = k pi /4, so between 0 and pi, the zeros are at 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi. So intervals: [0, pi/4], [pi/4, pi/2], [pi/2, 3pi/4], [3pi/4, pi]. The sign alternates each interval.

But computing this integral would be tedious, but according to our general formula, it should also equal pi. Let me see.

But perhaps there&#x27;s a pattern here. If the integral equals pi for n=1 and n=2, then maybe for all n, the integral is equal to pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi. But that seems counterintuitive at first, but maybe it&#x27;s correct.

Wait, the reasoning via substitution gave us that for any n, the integral equals pi. So even before taking the limit, the integral is pi. Therefore, the limit is pi.

But that seems surprising. Let me check with another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the average of |sin(2nx)| over the interval. Since |sin(2nx)| has average value 2/pi over each period. Then, if we can write the integral as ∫₀^pi x * |sin(2nx)| dx ≈ ∫₀^pi x * (2/pi) dx = (2/pi) * (pi² / 2) = pi. So that also gives pi.

But this is only an approximation when n is large, right? But according to the substitution method, it&#x27;s exact for any n. So maybe the integral is exactly pi for any n. But then why does the problem ask for the limit as n approaches infinity? If the integral is pi for all n, then the limit is pi. But maybe the problem is set in such a way that regardless of n, the integral is pi. Wait, but how is that possible?

Wait, when we did the substitution, we saw that the integral is exactly pi, regardless of n. So even when n is 1, 2, 3, etc., the integral is exactly pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is just pi. So the answer is pi.

But that seems too straightforward. Maybe the problem was designed to test if we realize that despite the oscillating function, the integral evaluates to the same value for any n. But why is that?

Let me verify for n=1/2. Wait, n is an integer going to infinity, but if we take n=1/2, which is not an integer, but just to see. Wait, no, n is a positive integer here. But in any case, the substitution works for any positive real n, but in the problem, n is approaching infinity through integer values. However, the key point is that the integral is always pi. So regardless of n, the integral is pi, so the limit is pi.

But that seems strange. Let me check n=1 case again. Wait, when n=1, the integral is pi. When n=2, the integral is pi. Wait, so is this a general result? For any integer n, ∫₀^pi x |sin(2n x)| dx = pi. How is that possible?

Wait, but if we make substitution t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). The integral becomes (1/(2n)) ∫₀^{2n pi} [t/(2n)] |sin t| dt = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2n pi} t |sin t| dt. Then, according to our previous calculation, that integral is 4 pi n², so (1/(4n²)) * 4 pi n² = pi. So yes, this shows that for any n, the integral equals pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi.

So the answer is pi. Therefore, the box answer is \boxed{\pi}

But let me just verify once more with n=1. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx, we saw earlier that it&#x27;s pi. Let me compute numerically for n=1. Let&#x27;s use approximate values.

The integral for n=1 was pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi, which is approximately 3.1416. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx numerically, say using trapezoidal rule with a few intervals, would I get roughly pi?

Let&#x27;s try. Divide [0, pi] into four intervals: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi.

Compute x |sin(2x)| at these points:

At 0: 0 * |0| = 0

At pi/4: (pi/4) * |sin(pi/2)| = (pi/4)*1 ≈ 0.7854

At pi/2: (pi/2)*|sin(pi)| = (pi/2)*0 = 0

At 3pi/4: (3pi/4)*|sin(3pi/2)| = (3pi/4)*1 ≈ 2.3562

At pi: pi * |sin(2pi)| = pi * 0 = 0

Using trapezoidal rule:

Approximate integral ≈ (pi/4)/2 [0 + 2*(0.7854) + 2*0 + 2*(2.3562) + 0] = (pi/8) [0 + 1.5708 + 0 + 4.7124 + 0] = (pi/8)*(6.2832) ≈ (pi/8)*(2pi) ≈ (pi^2)/4 ≈ 2.4674

But pi is approximately 3.1416, so this is a rough approximation. The trapezoidal rule with four intervals isn&#x27;t very accurate here because the function is oscillating. But if we take more intervals, it would approach pi. For example, if we take n=1 and compute the integral using more intervals, it should approach pi.

Alternatively, trust the analytical result which shows that the integral is exactly pi for any n. Therefore, the limit is pi.

Wait, this is fascinating. So the integral ∫₀^pi x |sin(2nx)| dx is equal to pi for any positive integer n, hence the limit as n approaches infinity is also pi. Therefore, the answer is pi. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\pi}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\pi}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\), we start by considering the integral involving the rapidly oscillating function \( |\sin(2nx)| \).

First, we make a substitution \( t = 2nx \), which transforms the integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx = \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt
\]

Next, we analyze the integral \( \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \). By splitting this integral into intervals of length \( \pi \), we recognize that each interval contributes:
\[
\int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du
\]

This integral can be decomposed and evaluated using integration by parts:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du = k\pi \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du + \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du
\]

The results of these integrals are:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du = \pi
\]

Summing these contributions over all intervals from \( k = 0 \) to \( 2n - 1 \), we find:
\[
\int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} (2k\pi + \pi) = 4\pi n^2
\]

Substituting back into the original integral, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{4n^2} \cdot 4\pi n^2 = \pi
\]

Thus, the integral \(\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\) evaluates to \(\pi\) for any \( n \). Therefore, the limit as \( n \to \infty \) is:
\[
\boxed{\pi}

Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of the integral from 0 to pi of x times the absolute value of sin(2nx) dx. Hmm. Let me write that down properly to visualize it better.

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx \]

Okay, so the integral involves x multiplied by the absolute value of sin(2nx), and we need to find its limit as n becomes very large. First, I remember that integrals involving rapidly oscillating functions like sine or cosine can sometimes be simplified using methods like the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma or by considering the average value over the oscillations. But here, there&#x27;s an absolute value, which complicates things a bit because the absolute value of sine is a non-negative function with period pi/n instead of 2pi/n. Wait, let me check that.

The function sin(2nx) has a period of pi/n because the period of sin(kx) is 2pi/k, so here k is 2n, so period is 2pi/(2n) = pi/n. But when we take the absolute value, the period halves, so the period of |sin(2nx)| is pi/(2n). So each &quot;hill&quot; of the sine wave becomes a hump from 0 to pi/(2n), then another hump from pi/(2n) to pi/n, etc. So the function |sin(2nx)| oscillates very rapidly as n becomes large, with period pi/n. So the integral is over x from 0 to pi, multiplied by this oscillating function.

Now, since n is going to infinity, the oscillations are getting extremely rapid, so maybe we can use the concept of the average value of the function over each period. I recall that for a rapidly oscillating function, the integral can be approximated by integrating the function against the average value of the oscillating part. So perhaps the x term can be treated as a constant over each small interval of length pi/n, and then multiplied by the average of |sin(2nx)| over that interval.

Let me recall that the average value of |sin(u)| over one period pi (since the period of |sin(u)| is pi). The average value is (2/pi). Because the integral of |sin(u)| over 0 to pi is 2, so the average is 2/pi. Therefore, if we can replace |sin(2nx)| by its average value 2/pi, then the integral becomes the integral of x*(2/pi) dx from 0 to pi, and then take the limit as n goes to infinity. But wait, does that work here?

Wait, but the problem is that x is also varying over the interval [0, pi], so maybe we need to be more careful. Let me think. If the oscillations are very rapid, then over each small interval, x is approximately constant, and the integral over that interval can be approximated by x (constant) times the integral of |sin(2nx)| over that interval. Then, since the integral of |sin(2nx)| over each period pi/n is 2/(2n) * 2 = 2/(2n)? Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s do it more carefully.

Let me make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let’s set t = 2n x. Then when x goes from 0 to pi, t goes from 0 to 2n pi. Then dx = dt/(2n). So substituting into the integral, we get:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \frac{t}{2n} |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Wait, no, hold on. Let me check that substitution again. If t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), so dx = dt/(2n). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \left( \frac{t}{2n} \right) |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \]

So the original integral is equal to (1/(4n²)) times the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ. Then, we need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/(4n²)) times that integral. So the problem reduces to understanding the growth of the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ as n becomes large.

Now, let me analyze the integral I(n) = ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt. Let&#x27;s consider splitting this integral into a sum over each period of |sin t|. Since |sin t| has period π, the interval from 0 to 2nπ can be divided into 2n intervals each of length π. So:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} ∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt

But in each interval [kπ, (k+1)π], |sin t| = |sin(t - kπ)|, which is sin(t - kπ) when k is even and sin(t - kπ) when k is odd, but since it&#x27;s absolute value, it&#x27;s just sin(t&#x27;) where t&#x27; = t - kπ. So in each interval, we can substitute t = kπ + u, where u goes from 0 to π. Then:

∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt = ∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) |sin(kπ + u)| du

But |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u| because sin(kπ + u) = sin u if k is even (since sin(kπ + u) = sin u when k even) and sin(kπ + u) = sin(u + π) = -sin u when k is odd, but absolute value makes it |sin u| in either case. Therefore, |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u|. But since u is from 0 to π, |sin u| = sin u. Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) sin u du

So substituting back:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} [ kπ ∫_{0}^{\pi} \sin u du + ∫_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u du ]

Let me compute those two integrals separately. First, ∫₀^π sin u du = 2, since the integral of sin u is -cos u, evaluated from 0 to pi: -cos pi + cos 0 = -(-1) + 1 = 2. Second, ∫₀^π u sin u du. That integral can be computed via integration by parts. Let me do that.

Let u = t, dv = sin t dt. Then du = dt, v = -cos t. So:

∫ t sin t dt = -t cos t + ∫ cos t dt = -t cos t + sin t + C

Evaluated from 0 to pi:

[-pi cos pi + sin pi] - [0 + sin 0] = -pi*(-1) + 0 - 0 = pi

So ∫₀^π u sin u du = pi

Therefore, each term in the sum becomes:

kπ * 2 + pi = 2kπ + pi

Therefore, I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} (2kπ + pi) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 2kπ + Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} pi

Let&#x27;s compute the two sums separately.

First sum: 2π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} k = 2π * [ (2n - 1)(2n) ) / 2 ] = 2π * [ (4n² - 2n) / 2 ] = 2π * (2n² - n ) = 4π n² - 2π n

Second sum: π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 1 = π * 2n = 2π n

Therefore, I(n) = 4π n² - 2π n + 2π n = 4π n²

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. The -2π n and +2π n cancel out, so I(n) = 4π n².

So going back to the original expression, the integral we had was (1/(4n²)) * I(n) = (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π

Wait, so the integral simplifies to π, and since we&#x27;re taking the limit as n approaches infinity, the limit is π? But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, first, substitution t = 2n x, so x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{2nπ} (t/(2n)) |sin t| * (dt/(2n)) = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt

Which we called I(n). Then we split I(n) into 2n intervals of length pi each, substituted each integral, found that each contributes 2kπ + pi, summed over k from 0 to 2n - 1, which gave 4π n².

Therefore, (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π. Therefore, the integral evaluates to π for any n? But that can&#x27;t be, because when n increases, the integral is oscillating? Wait, but according to this calculation, regardless of n, the integral is exactly π. So the limit as n approaches infinity is π? Hmm, but that seems counterintuitive because if you have x multiplied by |sin(2nx)|, which is oscillating rapidly, but the average value of |sin(2nx)| is 2/pi, so integrating x*(2/pi) from 0 to pi would give (2/pi)*(pi²/2) = pi. So that&#x27;s the same result. So in fact, the integral is equal to pi for all n? Wait, that seems strange.

Wait, no, the substitution led us to I(n) = 4π n², so when we multiply by 1/(4n²), it cancels out, leaving π. So does that mean that the integral is exactly equal to pi for any n? That seems incorrect because if n is 1, let&#x27;s test n=1. Compute the integral from 0 to pi of x |sin(2x)| dx. Let me compute that numerically.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute ∫₀^π x |sin(2x)| dx when n=1. Let&#x27;s split the integral into intervals where sin(2x) is positive and negative. Since sin(2x) is positive in [0, pi/2] and negative in [pi/2, pi]. So |sin(2x)| = sin(2x) in [0, pi/2] and -sin(2x) in [pi/2, pi].

So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{pi/2} x sin(2x) dx + ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx

But let&#x27;s compute these two integrals. Let me compute the first one: ∫ x sin(2x) dx. Integration by parts. Let u = x, dv = sin(2x) dx. Then du = dx, v = -1/2 cos(2x).

So ∫ x sin(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/2) ∫ cos(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x) + C

Evaluate from 0 to pi/2:

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

At 0: -0 + 0 = 0

So the first integral is pi/4.

Second integral: ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx = - ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x sin(2x) dx

Again, integration by parts:

Same as before, integral of x sin(2x) dx is -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x)

Evaluate from pi/2 to pi:

At pi: -pi/2 cos(2pi) + (1/4) sin(2pi) = -pi/2 * 1 + 0 = -pi/2

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

Therefore, the integral is [ -pi/2 - pi/4 ] = -3pi/4, but multiplied by the negative sign outside:

- [ -3pi/4 ] = 3pi/4

Therefore, the second integral is 3pi/4

So total integral for n=1 is pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi. Which matches our previous result. So the integral is indeed pi when n=1. Wait, so does that mean that the integral is always pi, regardless of n? Let&#x27;s test n=2.

Wait, for n=2, the integral is ∫₀^pi x |sin(4x)| dx. Let me check if that&#x27;s pi as well.

Again, split into intervals where sin(4x) is positive and negative. The zeros of sin(4x) are at x = k pi /4, so between 0 and pi, the zeros are at 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi. So intervals: [0, pi/4], [pi/4, pi/2], [pi/2, 3pi/4], [3pi/4, pi]. The sign alternates each interval.

But computing this integral would be tedious, but according to our general formula, it should also equal pi. Let me see.

But perhaps there&#x27;s a pattern here. If the integral equals pi for n=1 and n=2, then maybe for all n, the integral is equal to pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi. But that seems counterintuitive at first, but maybe it&#x27;s correct.

Wait, the reasoning via substitution gave us that for any n, the integral equals pi. So even before taking the limit, the integral is pi. Therefore, the limit is pi.

But that seems surprising. Let me check with another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the average of |sin(2nx)| over the interval. Since |sin(2nx)| has average value 2/pi over each period. Then, if we can write the integral as ∫₀^pi x * |sin(2nx)| dx ≈ ∫₀^pi x * (2/pi) dx = (2/pi) * (pi² / 2) = pi. So that also gives pi.

But this is only an approximation when n is large, right? But according to the substitution method, it&#x27;s exact for any n. So maybe the integral is exactly pi for any n. But then why does the problem ask for the limit as n approaches infinity? If the integral is pi for all n, then the limit is pi.

Let me verify for n=1/2. Wait, n is an integer going to infinity, but if we take n=1/2, which is not an integer, but just to see. Wait, no, n is a positive integer here. But in any case, the substitution works for any positive real n, but in the problem, n is approaching infinity through integer values. However, the key point is that the integral is always pi. So regardless of n, the integral is pi, so the limit is pi.

But that seems strange. Let me check n=1 case again. Wait, when n=1, the integral is pi. When n=2, the integral is pi. Wait, so is this a general result? For any integer n, ∫₀^pi x |sin(2n x)| dx = pi. How is that possible?

Wait, but if we make substitution t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). The integral becomes (1/(2n)) ∫₀^{2n pi} [t/(2n)] |sin t| dt = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2n pi} t |sin t| dt. Then, according to our previous calculation, that integral is 4 pi n², so (1/(4n²)) * 4 pi n² = pi. So yes, this shows that for any n, the integral equals pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi.

So the answer is pi. Therefore, the box answer is \boxed{\pi}

But let me just verify once more with n=1. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx, we saw earlier that it&#x27;s pi. Let me compute numerically for n=1. Let&#x27;s use approximate values.

Let&#x27;s try. Divide [0, pi] into four intervals: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi.

Compute x |sin(2x)| at these points:

At 0: 0 * |0| = 0

At pi/4: (pi/4) * |sin(pi/2)| = (pi/4)*1 ≈ 0.7854

At pi/2: (pi/2)*|sin(pi)| = (pi/2)*0 = 0

At 3pi/4: (3pi/4)*|sin(3pi/2)| = (3pi/4)*1 ≈ 2.3562

At pi: pi * |sin(2pi)| = pi * 0 = 0

Using trapezoidal rule:

Approximate integral ≈ (pi/4)/2 [0 + 2*(0.7854) + 2*0 + 2*(2.3562) + 0] = (pi/8) [0 + 1.5708 + 0 + 4.7124 + 0] = (pi/8)*(6.2832) ≈ (pi/8)*(2pi) ≈ (pi^2)/4 ≈ 2.4674

But pi is approximately 3.1416, so this is a rough approximation. The trapezoidal rule with four intervals isn&#x27;t very accurate here because the function is oscillating. But if we take more intervals, it would approach pi. For example, if we take n=1 and compute the integral using more intervals, it should approach pi.

Alternatively, trust the analytical result which shows that the integral is exactly pi for any n. Therefore, the limit is pi.

Wait, this is fascinating. So the integral ∫₀^pi x |sin(2nx)| dx is equal to pi for any positive integer n, hence the limit as n approaches infinity is also pi. Therefore, the answer is pi. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\pi}

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\), we start by considering the integral involving the rapidly oscillating function \( |\sin(2nx)| \).

First, we make a substitution \( t = 2nx \), which transforms the integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx = \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt

Next, we analyze the integral \( \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \). By splitting this integral into intervals of length \( \pi \), we recognize that each interval contributes:
\[
\int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du

This integral can be decomposed and evaluated using integration by parts:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du = k\pi \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du + \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du
\]

The results of these integrals are:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du = \pi
\]

Summing these contributions over all intervals from \( k = 0 \) to \( 2n - 1 \), we find:
\[
\int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} (2k\pi + \pi) = 4\pi n^2
\]

Substituting back into the original integral, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{4n^2} \cdot 4\pi n^2 = \pi
\]

Thus, the integral \(\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\) evaluates to \(\pi\) for any \( n \). Therefore, the limit as \( n \to \infty \) is:
\[
\boxed{\pi}

Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of the integral from 0 to pi of x times the absolute value of sin(2nx) dx. Hmm. Let me write that down properly to visualize it better.

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx \]

Okay, so the integral involves x multiplied by the absolute value of sin(2nx), and we need to find its limit as n becomes very large. First, I remember that integrals involving rapidly oscillating functions like sine or cosine can sometimes be simplified using methods like the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma or by considering the average value over the oscillations. But here, there&#x27;s an absolute value, which complicates things a bit because the absolute value of sine is a non-negative function with period pi/n instead of 2pi/n. Wait, let me check that.

The function sin(2nx) has a period of pi/n because the period of sin(kx) is 2pi/k, so here k is 2n, so period is 2pi/(2n) = pi/n. But when we take the absolute value, the period halves, so the period of |sin(2nx)| is pi/(2n). So each &quot;hill&quot; of the sine wave becomes a hump from 0 to pi/(2n), then another hump from pi/(2n) to pi/n, etc. So the function |sin(2nx)| oscillates very rapidly as n becomes large, with period pi/n. So the integral is over x from 0 to pi, multiplied by this oscillating function.

Now, since n is going to infinity, the oscillations are getting extremely rapid, so maybe we can use the concept of the average value of the function over each period. I recall that for a rapidly oscillating function, the integral can be approximated by integrating the function against the average value of the oscillating part. So perhaps the x term can be treated as a constant over each small interval of length pi/n, and then multiplied by the average of |sin(2nx)| over that interval.

Let me recall that the average value of |sin(u)| over one period pi (since the period of |sin(u)| is pi). The average value is (2/pi). Because the integral of |sin(u)| over 0 to pi is 2, so the average is 2/pi. Therefore, if we can replace |sin(2nx)| by its average value 2/pi, then the integral becomes the integral of x*(2/pi) dx from 0 to pi, and then take the limit as n goes to infinity. But wait, does that work here?

Wait, but the problem is that x is also varying over the interval [0, pi], so maybe we need to be more careful. Let me think. If the oscillations are very rapid, then over each small interval, x is approximately constant, and the integral over that interval can be approximated by x (constant) times the integral of |sin(2nx)| over that interval. Then, since the integral of |sin(2nx)| over each period pi/n is 2/(2n) * 2 = 2/(2n)? Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s do it more carefully.

Let me make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let’s set t = 2n x. Then when x goes from 0 to pi, t goes from 0 to 2n pi. Then dx = dt/(2n). So substituting into the integral, we get:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \frac{t}{2n} |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Wait, no, hold on. Let me check that substitution again. If t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), so dx = dt/(2n). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \left( \frac{t}{2n} \right) |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \]

So the original integral is equal to (1/(4n²)) times the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ. Then, we need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/(4n²)) times that integral. So the problem reduces to understanding the growth of the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ as n becomes large.

Now, let me analyze the integral I(n) = ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt. Let&#x27;s consider splitting this integral into a sum over each period of |sin t|. Since |sin t| has period π, the interval from 0 to 2nπ can be divided into 2n intervals each of length π. So:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} ∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt

But in each interval [kπ, (k+1)π], |sin t| = |sin(t - kπ)|, which is sin(t - kπ) when k is even and sin(t - kπ) when k is odd, but since it&#x27;s absolute value, it&#x27;s just sin(t&#x27;) where t&#x27; = t - kπ. So in each interval, we can substitute t = kπ + u, where u goes from 0 to π. Then:

∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt = ∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) |sin(kπ + u)| du

But |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u| because sin(kπ + u) = sin u if k is even (since sin(kπ + u) = sin u when k even) and sin(kπ + u) = sin(u + π) = -sin u when k is odd, but absolute value makes it |sin u| in either case. Therefore, |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u|. But since u is from 0 to π, |sin u| = sin u. Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) sin u du

So substituting back:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} [ kπ ∫_{0}^{\pi} \sin u du + ∫_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u du ]

Let me compute those two integrals separately. First, ∫₀^π sin u du = 2, since the integral of sin u is -cos u, evaluated from 0 to pi: -cos pi + cos 0 = -(-1) + 1 = 2. Second, ∫₀^π u sin u du. That integral can be computed via integration by parts. Let me do that.

Let u = t, dv = sin t dt. Then du = dt, v = -cos t. So:

∫ t sin t dt = -t cos t + ∫ cos t dt = -t cos t + sin t + C

Evaluated from 0 to pi:

[-pi cos pi + sin pi] - [0 + sin 0] = -pi*(-1) + 0 - 0 = pi

So ∫₀^π u sin u du = pi

Therefore, each term in the sum becomes:

kπ * 2 + pi = 2kπ + pi

Therefore, I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} (2kπ + pi) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 2kπ + Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} pi

Let&#x27;s compute the two sums separately.

First sum: 2π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} k = 2π * [ (2n - 1)(2n) ) / 2 ] = 2π * [ (4n² - 2n) / 2 ] = 2π * (2n² - n ) = 4π n² - 2π n

Second sum: π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 1 = π * 2n = 2π n

Therefore, I(n) = 4π n² - 2π n + 2π n = 4π n²

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. The -2π n and +2π n cancel out, so I(n) = 4π n².

So going back to the original expression, the integral we had was (1/(4n²)) * I(n) = (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π

Wait, so the integral simplifies to π, and since we&#x27;re taking the limit as n approaches infinity, the limit is π? But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, first, substitution t = 2n x, so x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{2nπ} (t/(2n)) |sin t| * (dt/(2n)) = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt

Which we called I(n). Then we split I(n) into 2n intervals of length pi each, substituted each integral, found that each contributes 2kπ + pi, summed over k from 0 to 2n - 1, which gave 4π n².

Therefore, (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π. Therefore, the integral evaluates to π for any n? But that can&#x27;t be, because when n increases, the integral is oscillating? Wait, but according to this calculation, regardless of n, the integral is exactly π. So the limit as n approaches infinity is π? Hmm, but that seems counterintuitive because if you have x multiplied by |sin(2nx)|, which is oscillating rapidly, but the average value of |sin(2nx)| is 2/pi, so integrating x*(2/pi) from 0 to pi would give (2/pi)*(pi²/2) = pi. So that&#x27;s the same result. So in fact, the integral is equal to pi for all n? Wait, that seems strange.

Wait, no, the substitution led us to I(n) = 4π n², so when we multiply by 1/(4n²), it cancels out, leaving π. So does that mean that the integral is exactly equal to pi for any n? That seems incorrect because if n is 1, let&#x27;s test n=1. Compute the integral from 0 to pi of x |sin(2x)| dx. Let me compute that numerically.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute ∫₀^π x |sin(2x)| dx when n=1. Let&#x27;s split the integral into intervals where sin(2x) is positive and negative. Since sin(2x) is positive in [0, pi/2] and negative in [pi/2, pi]. So |sin(2x)| = sin(2x) in [0, pi/2] and -sin(2x) in [pi/2, pi].

So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{pi/2} x sin(2x) dx + ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx

But let&#x27;s compute these two integrals. Let me compute the first one: ∫ x sin(2x) dx. Integration by parts. Let u = x, dv = sin(2x) dx. Then du = dx, v = -1/2 cos(2x).

So ∫ x sin(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/2) ∫ cos(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x) + C

Evaluate from 0 to pi/2:

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

At 0: -0 + 0 = 0

So the first integral is pi/4.

Second integral: ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx = - ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x sin(2x) dx

Again, integration by parts:

Same as before, integral of x sin(2x) dx is -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x)

Evaluate from pi/2 to pi:

At pi: -pi/2 cos(2pi) + (1/4) sin(2pi) = -pi/2 * 1 + 0 = -pi/2

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

Therefore, the integral is [ -pi/2 - pi/4 ] = -3pi/4, but multiplied by the negative sign outside:

- [ -3pi/4 ] = 3pi/4

Therefore, the second integral is 3pi/4

So total integral for n=1 is pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi. Which matches our previous result. So the integral is indeed pi when n=1. Wait, so does that mean that the integral is always pi, regardless of n? Let&#x27;s test n=2.

Wait, for n=2, the integral is ∫₀^pi x |sin(4x)| dx. Let me check if that&#x27;s pi as well.

Again, split into intervals where sin(4x) is positive and negative. The zeros of sin(4x) are at x = k pi /4, so between 0 and pi, the zeros are at 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi. So intervals: [0, pi/4], [pi/4, pi/2], [pi/2, 3pi/4], [3pi/4, pi]. The sign alternates each interval.

But computing this integral would be tedious, but according to our general formula, it should also equal pi. Let me see.

But perhaps there&#x27;s a pattern here. If the integral equals pi for n=1 and n=2, then maybe for all n, the integral is equal to pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi. But that seems counterintuitive at first, but maybe it&#x27;s correct.

Wait, the reasoning via substitution gave us that for any n, the integral equals pi. So even before taking the limit, the integral is pi. Therefore, the limit is pi.

But that seems surprising. Let me check with another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the average of |sin(2nx)| over the interval. Since |sin(2nx)| has average value 2/pi over each period. Then, if we can write the integral as ∫₀^pi x * |sin(2nx)| dx ≈ ∫₀^pi x * (2/pi) dx = (2/pi) * (pi² / 2) = pi. So that also gives pi.

But this is only an approximation when n is large, right? But according to the substitution method, it&#x27;s exact for any n. So maybe the integral is exactly pi for any n. But then why does the problem ask for the limit as n approaches infinity? If the integral is pi for all n, then the limit is pi. But maybe the problem is set in such a way that regardless of n, the integral is pi. Wait, but how is that possible?

Wait, when we did the substitution, we saw that the integral is exactly pi, regardless of n. So even when n is 1, 2, 3, etc., the integral is exactly pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is just pi. So the answer is pi.

But that seems too straightforward. Maybe the problem was designed to test if we realize that despite the oscillating function, the integral evaluates to the same value for any n. But why is that?

Let me verify for n=1/2. Wait, n is an integer going to infinity, but if we take n=1/2, which is not an integer, but just to see. Wait, no, n is a positive integer here. But in any case, the substitution works for any positive real n, but in the problem, n is approaching infinity through integer values. However, the key point is that the integral is always pi. So regardless of n, the integral is pi, so the limit is pi.

But that seems strange. Let me check n=1 case again. Wait, when n=1, the integral is pi. When n=2, the integral is pi. Wait, so is this a general result? For any integer n, ∫₀^pi x |sin(2n x)| dx = pi. How is that possible?

Wait, but if we make substitution t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). The integral becomes (1/(2n)) ∫₀^{2n pi} [t/(2n)] |sin t| dt = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2n pi} t |sin t| dt. Then, according to our previous calculation, that integral is 4 pi n², so (1/(4n²)) * 4 pi n² = pi. So yes, this shows that for any n, the integral equals pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi.

So the answer is pi. Therefore, the box answer is \boxed{\pi}

But let me just verify once more with n=1. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx, we saw earlier that it&#x27;s pi. Let me compute numerically for n=1. Let&#x27;s use approximate values.

The integral for n=1 was pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi, which is approximately 3.1416. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx numerically, say using trapezoidal rule with a few intervals, would I get roughly pi?

Let&#x27;s try. Divide [0, pi] into four intervals: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi.

Compute x |sin(2x)| at these points:

At 0: 0 * |0| = 0

At pi/4: (pi/4) * |sin(pi/2)| = (pi/4)*1 ≈ 0.7854

At pi/2: (pi/2)*|sin(pi)| = (pi/2)*0 = 0

At 3pi/4: (3pi/4)*|sin(3pi/2)| = (3pi/4)*1 ≈ 2.3562

At pi: pi * |sin(2pi)| = pi * 0 = 0

Using trapezoidal rule:

Approximate integral ≈ (pi/4)/2 [0 + 2*(0.7854) + 2*0 + 2*(2.3562) + 0] = (pi/8) [0 + 1.5708 + 0 + 4.7124 + 0] = (pi/8)*(6.2832) ≈ (pi/8)*(2pi) ≈ (pi^2)/4 ≈ 2.4674

But pi is approximately 3.1416, so this is a rough approximation. The trapezoidal rule with four intervals isn&#x27;t very accurate here because the function is oscillating. But if we take more intervals, it would approach pi. For example, if we take n=1 and compute the integral using more intervals, it should approach pi.

Alternatively, trust the analytical result which shows that the integral is exactly pi for any n. Therefore, the limit is pi.

Wait, this is fascinating. So the integral ∫₀^pi x |sin(2nx)| dx is equal to pi for any positive integer n, hence the limit as n approaches infinity is also pi. Therefore, the answer is pi. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\pi}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\pi}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\), we start by considering the integral involving the rapidly oscillating function \( |\sin(2nx)| \).

First, we make a substitution \( t = 2nx \), which transforms the integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx = \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt
\]

Next, we analyze the integral \( \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \). By splitting this integral into intervals of length \( \pi \), we recognize that each interval contributes:
\[
\int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du
\]

This integral can be decomposed and evaluated using integration by parts:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du = k\pi \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du + \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du
\]

The results of these integrals are:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du = \pi
\]

Summing these contributions over all intervals from \( k = 0 \) to \( 2n - 1 \), we find:
\[
\int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} (2k\pi + \pi) = 4\pi n^2
\]

Substituting back into the original integral, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{4n^2} \cdot 4\pi n^2 = \pi
\]

Thus, the integral \(\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\) evaluates to \(\pi\) for any \( n \). Therefore, the limit as \( n \to \infty \) is:
\[
\boxed{\pi}

Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of the integral from 0 to pi of x times the absolute value of sin(2nx) dx. Hmm. Let me write that down properly to visualize it better.

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx \]

Okay, so the integral involves x multiplied by the absolute value of sin(2nx), and we need to find its limit as n becomes very large. First, I remember that integrals involving rapidly oscillating functions like sine or cosine can sometimes be simplified using methods like the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma or by considering the average value over the oscillations. But here, there&#x27;s an absolute value, which complicates things a bit because the absolute value of sine is a non-negative function with period pi/n instead of 2pi/n. Wait, let me check that.

The function sin(2nx) has a period of pi/n because the period of sin(kx) is 2pi/k, so here k is 2n, so period is 2pi/(2n) = pi/n. But when we take the absolute value, the period halves, so the period of |sin(2nx)| is pi/(2n). So each &quot;hill&quot; of the sine wave becomes a hump from 0 to pi/(2n), then another hump from pi/(2n) to pi/n, etc. So the function |sin(2nx)| oscillates very rapidly as n becomes large, with period pi/n. So the integral is over x from 0 to pi, multiplied by this oscillating function.

Now, since n is going to infinity, the oscillations are getting extremely rapid, so maybe we can use the concept of the average value of the function over each period. I recall that for a rapidly oscillating function, the integral can be approximated by integrating the function against the average value of the oscillating part. So perhaps the x term can be treated as a constant over each small interval of length pi/n, and then multiplied by the average of |sin(2nx)| over that interval.

Let me recall that the average value of |sin(u)| over one period pi (since the period of |sin(u)| is pi). The average value is (2/pi). Because the integral of |sin(u)| over 0 to pi is 2, so the average is 2/pi. Therefore, if we can replace |sin(2nx)| by its average value 2/pi, then the integral becomes the integral of x*(2/pi) dx from 0 to pi, and then take the limit as n goes to infinity. But wait, does that work here?

Wait, but the problem is that x is also varying over the interval [0, pi], so maybe we need to be more careful. Let me think. If the oscillations are very rapid, then over each small interval, x is approximately constant, and the integral over that interval can be approximated by x (constant) times the integral of |sin(2nx)| over that interval. Then, since the integral of |sin(2nx)| over each period pi/n is 2/(2n) * 2 = 2/(2n)? Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s do it more carefully.

Let me make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let’s set t = 2n x. Then when x goes from 0 to pi, t goes from 0 to 2n pi. Then dx = dt/(2n). So substituting into the integral, we get:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \frac{t}{2n} |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Wait, no, hold on. Let me check that substitution again. If t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), so dx = dt/(2n). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\[ \int_{0}^{2n\pi} \left( \frac{t}{2n} \right) |\sin t| \cdot \frac{dt}{2n} \]

Which simplifies to:

\[ \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \]

So the original integral is equal to (1/(4n²)) times the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ. Then, we need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/(4n²)) times that integral. So the problem reduces to understanding the growth of the integral of t |sin t| dt from 0 to 2nπ as n becomes large.

Now, let me analyze the integral I(n) = ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt. Let&#x27;s consider splitting this integral into a sum over each period of |sin t|. Since |sin t| has period π, the interval from 0 to 2nπ can be divided into 2n intervals each of length π. So:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} ∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt

But in each interval [kπ, (k+1)π], |sin t| = |sin(t - kπ)|, which is sin(t - kπ) when k is even and sin(t - kπ) when k is odd, but since it&#x27;s absolute value, it&#x27;s just sin(t&#x27;) where t&#x27; = t - kπ. So in each interval, we can substitute t = kπ + u, where u goes from 0 to π. Then:

∫_{kπ}^{(k+1)π} t |sin t| dt = ∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) |sin(kπ + u)| du

But |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u| because sin(kπ + u) = sin u if k is even (since sin(kπ + u) = sin u when k even) and sin(kπ + u) = sin(u + π) = -sin u when k is odd, but absolute value makes it |sin u| in either case. Therefore, |sin(kπ + u)| = |sin u|. But since u is from 0 to π, |sin u| = sin u. Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

∫_{0}^{π} (kπ + u) sin u du

So substituting back:

I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n-1} [ kπ ∫_{0}^{\pi} \sin u du + ∫_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u du ]

Let me compute those two integrals separately. First, ∫₀^π sin u du = 2, since the integral of sin u is -cos u, evaluated from 0 to pi: -cos pi + cos 0 = -(-1) + 1 = 2. Second, ∫₀^π u sin u du. That integral can be computed via integration by parts. Let me do that.

Let u = t, dv = sin t dt. Then du = dt, v = -cos t. So:

∫ t sin t dt = -t cos t + ∫ cos t dt = -t cos t + sin t + C

Evaluated from 0 to pi:

[-pi cos pi + sin pi] - [0 + sin 0] = -pi*(-1) + 0 - 0 = pi

So ∫₀^π u sin u du = pi

Therefore, each term in the sum becomes:

kπ * 2 + pi = 2kπ + pi

Therefore, I(n) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} (2kπ + pi) = Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 2kπ + Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} pi

Let&#x27;s compute the two sums separately.

First sum: 2π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} k = 2π * [ (2n - 1)(2n) ) / 2 ] = 2π * [ (4n² - 2n) / 2 ] = 2π * (2n² - n ) = 4π n² - 2π n

Second sum: π Σ_{k=0}^{2n - 1} 1 = π * 2n = 2π n

Therefore, I(n) = 4π n² - 2π n + 2π n = 4π n²

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. The -2π n and +2π n cancel out, so I(n) = 4π n².

So going back to the original expression, the integral we had was (1/(4n²)) * I(n) = (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π

Wait, so the integral simplifies to π, and since we&#x27;re taking the limit as n approaches infinity, the limit is π? But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, first, substitution t = 2n x, so x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). Then the integral becomes:

∫₀^{2nπ} (t/(2n)) |sin t| * (dt/(2n)) = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2nπ} t |sin t| dt

Which we called I(n). Then we split I(n) into 2n intervals of length pi each, substituted each integral, found that each contributes 2kπ + pi, summed over k from 0 to 2n - 1, which gave 4π n².

Therefore, (1/(4n²)) * 4π n² = π. Therefore, the integral evaluates to π for any n? But that can&#x27;t be, because when n increases, the integral is oscillating? Wait, but according to this calculation, regardless of n, the integral is exactly π. So the limit as n approaches infinity is π? Hmm, but that seems counterintuitive because if you have x multiplied by |sin(2nx)|, which is oscillating rapidly, but the average value of |sin(2nx)| is 2/pi, so integrating x*(2/pi) from 0 to pi would give (2/pi)*(pi²/2) = pi. So that&#x27;s the same result. So in fact, the integral is equal to pi for all n? Wait, that seems strange.

Wait, no, the substitution led us to I(n) = 4π n², so when we multiply by 1/(4n²), it cancels out, leaving π. So does that mean that the integral is exactly equal to pi for any n? That seems incorrect because if n is 1, let&#x27;s test n=1. Compute the integral from 0 to pi of x |sin(2x)| dx. Let me compute that numerically.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute ∫₀^π x |sin(2x)| dx when n=1. Let&#x27;s split the integral into intervals where sin(2x) is positive and negative. Since sin(2x) is positive in [0, pi/2] and negative in [pi/2, pi]. So |sin(2x)| = sin(2x) in [0, pi/2] and -sin(2x) in [pi/2, pi].

So the integral becomes:

∫₀^{pi/2} x sin(2x) dx + ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx

But let&#x27;s compute these two integrals. Let me compute the first one: ∫ x sin(2x) dx. Integration by parts. Let u = x, dv = sin(2x) dx. Then du = dx, v = -1/2 cos(2x).

So ∫ x sin(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/2) ∫ cos(2x) dx = -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x) + C

Evaluate from 0 to pi/2:

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

At 0: -0 + 0 = 0

So the first integral is pi/4.

Second integral: ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x (-sin(2x)) dx = - ∫_{pi/2}^{pi} x sin(2x) dx

Again, integration by parts:

Same as before, integral of x sin(2x) dx is -x/2 cos(2x) + (1/4) sin(2x)

Evaluate from pi/2 to pi:

At pi: -pi/2 cos(2pi) + (1/4) sin(2pi) = -pi/2 * 1 + 0 = -pi/2

At pi/2: - (pi/2)/2 cos(pi) + (1/4) sin(pi) = - (pi/4)(-1) + 0 = pi/4

Therefore, the integral is [ -pi/2 - pi/4 ] = -3pi/4, but multiplied by the negative sign outside:

- [ -3pi/4 ] = 3pi/4

Therefore, the second integral is 3pi/4

So total integral for n=1 is pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi. Which matches our previous result. So the integral is indeed pi when n=1. Wait, so does that mean that the integral is always pi, regardless of n? Let&#x27;s test n=2.

Wait, for n=2, the integral is ∫₀^pi x |sin(4x)| dx. Let me check if that&#x27;s pi as well.

Again, split into intervals where sin(4x) is positive and negative. The zeros of sin(4x) are at x = k pi /4, so between 0 and pi, the zeros are at 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi. So intervals: [0, pi/4], [pi/4, pi/2], [pi/2, 3pi/4], [3pi/4, pi]. The sign alternates each interval.

But computing this integral would be tedious, but according to our general formula, it should also equal pi. Let me see.

But perhaps there&#x27;s a pattern here. If the integral equals pi for n=1 and n=2, then maybe for all n, the integral is equal to pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi. But that seems counterintuitive at first, but maybe it&#x27;s correct.

Wait, the reasoning via substitution gave us that for any n, the integral equals pi. So even before taking the limit, the integral is pi. Therefore, the limit is pi.

But that seems surprising. Let me check with another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the average of |sin(2nx)| over the interval. Since |sin(2nx)| has average value 2/pi over each period. Then, if we can write the integral as ∫₀^pi x * |sin(2nx)| dx ≈ ∫₀^pi x * (2/pi) dx = (2/pi) * (pi² / 2) = pi. So that also gives pi.

But this is only an approximation when n is large, right? But according to the substitution method, it&#x27;s exact for any n. So maybe the integral is exactly pi for any n. But then why does the problem ask for the limit as n approaches infinity? If the integral is pi for all n, then the limit is pi. But maybe the problem is set in such a way that regardless of n, the integral is pi. Wait, but how is that possible?

Wait, when we did the substitution, we saw that the integral is exactly pi, regardless of n. So even when n is 1, 2, 3, etc., the integral is exactly pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is just pi. So the answer is pi.

But that seems too straightforward. Maybe the problem was designed to test if we realize that despite the oscillating function, the integral evaluates to the same value for any n. But why is that?

Let me verify for n=1/2. Wait, n is an integer going to infinity, but if we take n=1/2, which is not an integer, but just to see. Wait, no, n is a positive integer here. But in any case, the substitution works for any positive real n, but in the problem, n is approaching infinity through integer values. However, the key point is that the integral is always pi. So regardless of n, the integral is pi, so the limit is pi.

But that seems strange. Let me check n=1 case again. Wait, when n=1, the integral is pi. When n=2, the integral is pi. Wait, so is this a general result? For any integer n, ∫₀^pi x |sin(2n x)| dx = pi. How is that possible?

Wait, but if we make substitution t = 2n x, then x = t/(2n), dx = dt/(2n). The integral becomes (1/(2n)) ∫₀^{2n pi} [t/(2n)] |sin t| dt = (1/(4n²)) ∫₀^{2n pi} t |sin t| dt. Then, according to our previous calculation, that integral is 4 pi n², so (1/(4n²)) * 4 pi n² = pi. So yes, this shows that for any n, the integral equals pi. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity is pi.

So the answer is pi. Therefore, the box answer is \boxed{\pi}

But let me just verify once more with n=1. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx, we saw earlier that it&#x27;s pi. Let me compute numerically for n=1. Let&#x27;s use approximate values.

The integral for n=1 was pi/4 + 3pi/4 = pi, which is approximately 3.1416. If I compute ∫₀^pi x |sin(2x)| dx numerically, say using trapezoidal rule with a few intervals, would I get roughly pi?

Let&#x27;s try. Divide [0, pi] into four intervals: 0, pi/4, pi/2, 3pi/4, pi.

Compute x |sin(2x)| at these points:

At 0: 0 * |0| = 0

At pi/4: (pi/4) * |sin(pi/2)| = (pi/4)*1 ≈ 0.7854

At pi/2: (pi/2)*|sin(pi)| = (pi/2)*0 = 0

At 3pi/4: (3pi/4)*|sin(3pi/2)| = (3pi/4)*1 ≈ 2.3562

At pi: pi * |sin(2pi)| = pi * 0 = 0

Using trapezoidal rule:

Approximate integral ≈ (pi/4)/2 [0 + 2*(0.7854) + 2*0 + 2*(2.3562) + 0] = (pi/8) [0 + 1.5708 + 0 + 4.7124 + 0] = (pi/8)*(6.2832) ≈ (pi/8)*(2pi) ≈ (pi^2)/4 ≈ 2.4674

But pi is approximately 3.1416, so this is a rough approximation. The trapezoidal rule with four intervals isn&#x27;t very accurate here because the function is oscillating. But if we take more intervals, it would approach pi. For example, if we take n=1 and compute the integral using more intervals, it should approach pi.

Alternatively, trust the analytical result which shows that the integral is exactly pi for any n. Therefore, the limit is pi.

Wait, this is fascinating. So the integral ∫₀^pi x |sin(2nx)| dx is equal to pi for any positive integer n, hence the limit as n approaches infinity is also pi. Therefore, the answer is pi. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{\pi}

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\pi}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\), we start by considering the integral involving the rapidly oscillating function \( |\sin(2nx)| \).

First, we make a substitution \( t = 2nx \), which transforms the integral:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx = \frac{1}{4n^2} \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt
\]

Next, we analyze the integral \( \int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt \). By splitting this integral into intervals of length \( \pi \), we recognize that each interval contributes:
\[
\int_{k\pi}^{(k+1)\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du
\]

This integral can be decomposed and evaluated using integration by parts:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} (k\pi + u) \sin u \, du = k\pi \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du + \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du
\]

The results of these integrals are:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin u \, du = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad \int_{0}^{\pi} u \sin u \, du = \pi
\]

Summing these contributions over all intervals from \( k = 0 \) to \( 2n - 1 \), we find:
\[
\int_{0}^{2n\pi} t |\sin t| \, dt = \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} (2k\pi + \pi) = 4\pi n^2
\]

Substituting back into the original integral, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{4n^2} \cdot 4\pi n^2 = \pi
\]

Thus, the integral \(\int_{0}^{\pi} x |\sin(2nx)| \, dx\) evaluates to \(\pi\) for any \( n \). Therefore, the limit as \( n \to \infty \) is:
\[
\boxed{\pi}

Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this matrix problem here. Let me read it again: &quot;Let \( A \in M(n,\mathbb{R}) \) be a matrix with all real eigenvalues. Determine if it is true that all the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are also real.&quot; Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out whether squaring a matrix with real eigenvalues and then subtracting the matrix itself will result in a matrix that still has all real eigenvalues. 

First, let me recall some linear algebra concepts. If a matrix has all real eigenvalues, it&#x27;s called a real diagonalizable matrix, but wait, no, actually, diagonalizable matrices are those that can be written as PDP^{-1} where D is diagonal. But having all real eigenvalues doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the matrix is diagonalizable, right? For example, a Jordan block matrix has eigenvalues on the diagonal but is not diagonalizable if it has ones on the superdiagonal. So, the question doesn&#x27;t state that A is diagonalizable, just that all its eigenvalues are real. So A could be diagonalizable or not, but regardless, it&#x27;s a real matrix with real eigenvalues. 

Now, the problem is about the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \). Let me think. If A is diagonalizable, then it can be diagonalized as \( A = PDP^{-1} \), where D is a diagonal matrix with its eigenvalues on the diagonal. Then \( A^2 - A = PD^2P^{-1} - PDP^{-1} = P(D^2 - D)P^{-1} \). So the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) would be the diagonal entries of \( D^2 - D \), which are just \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) for each eigenvalue \( \lambda \) of A. Since all eigenvalues \( \lambda \) are real, then \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is also real. Therefore, if A is diagonalizable, then all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that A is diagonalizable. So even if A is not diagonalizable, does \( A^2 - A \) still have real eigenvalues? Hmm. Let me consider the case where A is not diagonalizable. For example, take a Jordan block matrix with real eigenvalues. Suppose A is a 2x2 Jordan block with eigenvalue λ. Then A is upper triangular with λ on the diagonal and 1 above the diagonal. Let me compute \( A^2 - A \). 

Let&#x27;s take λ as a real number. The Jordan block J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 &amp; 2\lambda \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 \end{pmatrix} \). So \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 - \lambda &amp; 2\lambda - 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \). 

The eigenvalues of \( J^2 - J \) are just the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), repeated twice. Since λ is real, \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is real. So even if A is a Jordan block, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, what about the off-diagonal entry? If the Jordan block is 2x2, then \( J^2 - J \) is upper triangular with eigenvalues \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), but the off-diagonal entry is \( 2\lambda - 1 \). However, eigenvalues are determined by the characteristic equation, which for a triangular matrix is just the product of (t - a_ii). So even though there&#x27;s an entry above the diagonal, the eigenvalues are still the diagonal entries. Therefore, even in the non-diagonalizable case, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check with a specific example. Suppose λ = 1. Then J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} 1^2 - 1 &amp; 2*1 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 1^2 -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \). The eigenvalues of this matrix are 0 and 0, which are real. 

Another example, take λ = 2. Then J^2 - J would be:

\[ \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 2 &amp; 4 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 4 -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 3 \\ 0 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix} \]. The eigenvalues are both 2, which are real. 

So even in the Jordan block case, the eigenvalues remain real. Therefore, whether A is diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me think again. Suppose we have a general matrix A with real eigenvalues. Then A can be written in Jordan canonical form, which is upper triangular with real eigenvalues on the diagonal and possibly ones on the superdiagonal. Then \( A^2 - A \) would be upper triangular because the product and difference of upper triangular matrices are upper triangular. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), each of which is real because \( \lambda_i \) is real. 

Therefore, regardless of whether A is diagonalizable, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me check with another example. Suppose A is a 3x3 matrix with a more complicated Jordan structure. For example, a Jordan matrix with blocks of different sizes. Let me take a Jordan matrix J with eigenvalues 1, 1, 1, but with a Jordan block of size 2 and another of size 1. Then:

J = diag(J1, J2), where J1 is the 2x2 block and J2 is the 1x1 block. So,

J1 = [[1, 1], [0, 1]], J2 = [1]. Then J is:

[[1, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 is:

[[1^2, 2*1, 0],
 [0, 1^2, 0],
 [0, 0, 1^2]] = [[1, 2, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 - J = [[1 -1, 2 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 1 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 0 -0, 1 -1]] = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]. 

The eigenvalues of this matrix are all 0, which are real. 

Alternatively, if I take a Jordan block with eigenvalue 0. Let&#x27;s say J is a 2x2 Jordan block with 0 on the diagonal. Then J = [[0,1],[0,0]]. Then J^2 is [[0,0],[0,0]], so J^2 - J = -J, which has eigenvalues 0 and 0. Still real. 

Another case: take a diagonal matrix with real eigenvalues. Then obviously, A^2 - A is diagonal with entries \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), which are real. 

So in all these examples, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, is there a case where even though the original matrix has real eigenvalues, the polynomial transformation \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) could introduce complex eigenvalues? 

Wait, but \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is a real number if \( \lambda \) is real. So if all eigenvalues of A are real, then applying the function f(x) = x^2 - x to each eigenvalue would result in real numbers. Therefore, even if the matrix is not diagonalizable, since in its Jordan form, the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A. 

Wait, is that true? For functions applied to matrices, in the case of Jordan blocks, if you have a Jordan block with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) for a function f analytic (like a polynomial) would be upper triangular with f(λ) on the diagonal and the upper diagonals filled with derivatives or something? Wait, actually, for a Jordan block J with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) is a matrix where each entry is given by the Taylor expansion of f around λ. For example, if J is a Jordan block of size k, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ)/1! on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, etc., up to the (k-1)th superdiagonal. 

But in our case, f(x) = x^2 - x. Let&#x27;s compute f(J) for a Jordan block J. Let&#x27;s take a 2x2 Jordan block again. 

J = [[λ, 1], [0, λ]]

Then f(J) = J^2 - J. As computed earlier, this is:

[[λ^2 - λ, 2λ - 1], [0, λ^2 - λ]]

So the diagonal entries are f(λ) = λ^2 - λ, which is real if λ is real. The superdiagonal entries are f’(λ) * 1 (since derivative of x^2 - x is 2x -1, evaluated at λ, so 2λ -1). 

But regardless, the eigenvalues of f(J) are still the diagonal entries, which are f(λ), so they are real. For higher Jordan blocks, the same logic applies. If you have a Jordan block of size 3 with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ) on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, but the eigenvalues are still just f(λ) with multiplicity equal to the size of the block. 

Therefore, even in the case of a non-diagonalizable matrix, the eigenvalues of f(A) = A^2 - A are f(λ_i), which are real numbers since λ_i are real. Therefore, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

Therefore, the answer should be yes, it&#x27;s true that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me try to see if there&#x27;s any possible way that even with real eigenvalues of A, the eigenvalues of A^2 - A could become complex. But given that eigenvalues of A are real, then f(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real number for each eigenvalue. Since eigenvalues of A^2 - A are precisely f(λ_i) for each eigenvalue λ_i of A, then they have to be real. 

But wait, is this always the case? For any matrix A with real eigenvalues, even if it&#x27;s not diagonalizable, are the eigenvalues of f(A) just f(λ_i)? 

Yes, because the eigenvalues of f(A) are the same as applying f to each eigenvalue of A, counting algebraic multiplicities. This is a standard result in linear algebra. For any function f that is analytic (and polynomials are certainly analytic), the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A. 

Therefore, regardless of the structure of A (whether diagonalizable or not), if all eigenvalues of A are real, then applying the polynomial f(x) = x^2 - x to each eigenvalue will result in real numbers. Thus, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A must be real. 

Therefore, the statement is true. 

But wait, let me think of another angle. Suppose someone claims that even though eigenvalues are transformed by f, maybe when the matrix is defective (not diagonalizable), the eigenvalues could somehow become complex. But no, because the eigenvalues of a real matrix are either real or come in complex conjugate pairs. However, in this problem, A is given to have all real eigenvalues, so there are no complex eigenvalues to conjugate. Therefore, even if A is defective, the eigenvalues of f(A) are still the f(λ_i), which are real. 

Alternatively, consider the characteristic polynomial of A. If all eigenvalues of A are real, then the characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors over ℝ. Then, perhaps the characteristic polynomial of A^2 - A can be related to that of A. But this might be more complicated. 

Alternatively, using the concept of functional calculus: for any matrix A, if p is a polynomial, then the eigenvalues of p(A) are p(λ) where λ are eigenvalues of A. Therefore, since A has real eigenvalues, p(A) will have eigenvalues p(λ), which are real if p(λ) is real for all real λ. 

But p(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real polynomial, so if λ is real, then p(λ) is real. Therefore, regardless of the structure of A, the eigenvalues of p(A) must be real. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that yes, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

I can&#x27;t find any counterexamples, and all the reasoning points towards the eigenvalues being real. So I think the answer is that it is indeed true.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{True}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a matrix \( A \in M(n,\mathbb{R}) \) with all real eigenvalues, we need to determine if all the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are also real.

1. **Diagonalizable Case**: If \( A \) is diagonalizable, it can be written as \( A = PDP^{-1} \) where \( D \) is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. Then \( A^2 - A = P(D^2 - D)P^{-1} \). The eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) for each eigenvalue \( \lambda \) of \( A \), which are real since \( \lambda \) is real.

2. **Non-Diagonalizable Case**: If \( A \) is not diagonalizable, it can be written in Jordan canonical form. For a Jordan block \( J \) with eigenvalue \( \lambda \), \( J^2 - J \) is upper triangular with diagonal entries \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), which are real. The off-diagonal entries do not affect the eigenvalues, which remain on the diagonal.

3. **General Case**: For any matrix \( A \) with real eigenvalues, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are given by applying the function \( f(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - \lambda \) to each eigenvalue of \( A \). Since \( \lambda \) is real, \( f(\lambda) \) is real. This result holds for any Jordan block structure, confirming that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

4. **Conclusion**: The eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real because they are derived from real eigenvalues of \( A \) through the polynomial \( f(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - \lambda \), which preserves real numbers.

Thus, the statement is true.

Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this matrix problem here. Let me read it again: &quot;Let \( A \in M(n,\mathbb{R}) \) be a matrix with all real eigenvalues. Determine if it is true that all the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are also real.&quot; Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out whether squaring a matrix with real eigenvalues and then subtracting the matrix itself will result in a matrix that still has all real eigenvalues. 

First, let me recall some linear algebra concepts. If a matrix has all real eigenvalues, it&#x27;s called a real diagonalizable matrix, but wait, no, actually, diagonalizable matrices are those that can be written as PDP^{-1} where D is diagonal. But having all real eigenvalues doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the matrix is diagonalizable, right? For example, a Jordan block matrix has eigenvalues on the diagonal but is not diagonalizable if it has ones on the superdiagonal. So, the question doesn&#x27;t state that A is diagonalizable, just that all its eigenvalues are real. So A could be diagonalizable or not, but regardless, it&#x27;s a real matrix with real eigenvalues. 

Now, the problem is about the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \). Let me think. If A is diagonalizable, then it can be diagonalized as \( A = PDP^{-1} \), where D is a diagonal matrix with its eigenvalues on the diagonal. Then \( A^2 - A = PD^2P^{-1} - PDP^{-1} = P(D^2 - D)P^{-1} \). So the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) would be the diagonal entries of \( D^2 - D \), which are just \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) for each eigenvalue \( \lambda \) of A. Since all eigenvalues \( \lambda \) are real, then \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is also real. Therefore, if A is diagonalizable, then all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that A is diagonalizable. So even if A is not diagonalizable, does \( A^2 - A \) still have real eigenvalues? Hmm. Let me consider the case where A is not diagonalizable. For example, take a Jordan block matrix with real eigenvalues. Suppose A is a 2x2 Jordan block with eigenvalue λ. Then A is upper triangular with λ on the diagonal and 1 above the diagonal. Let me compute \( A^2 - A \). 

Let&#x27;s take λ as a real number. The Jordan block J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 &amp; 2\lambda \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 \end{pmatrix} \). So \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 - \lambda &amp; 2\lambda - 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \). 

The eigenvalues of \( J^2 - J \) are just the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), repeated twice. Since λ is real, \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is real. So even if A is a Jordan block, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, what about the off-diagonal entry? If the Jordan block is 2x2, then \( J^2 - J \) is upper triangular with eigenvalues \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), but the off-diagonal entry is \( 2\lambda - 1 \). However, eigenvalues are determined by the characteristic equation, which for a triangular matrix is just the product of (t - a_ii). So even though there&#x27;s an entry above the diagonal, the eigenvalues are still the diagonal entries. Therefore, even in the non-diagonalizable case, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check with a specific example. Suppose λ = 1. Then J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} 1^2 - 1 &amp; 2*1 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 1^2 -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \). The eigenvalues of this matrix are 0 and 0, which are real. 

Another example, take λ = 2. Then J^2 - J would be:

\[ \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 2 &amp; 4 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 4 -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 3 \\ 0 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix} \]. The eigenvalues are both 2, which are real. 

So even in the Jordan block case, the eigenvalues remain real. Therefore, whether A is diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me think again. Suppose we have a general matrix A with real eigenvalues. Then A can be written in Jordan canonical form, which is upper triangular with real eigenvalues on the diagonal and possibly ones on the superdiagonal. Then \( A^2 - A \) would be upper triangular because the product and difference of upper triangular matrices are upper triangular. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), each of which is real because \( \lambda_i \) is real. 

Therefore, regardless of whether A is diagonalizable, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me check with another example. Suppose A is a 3x3 matrix with a more complicated Jordan structure. For example, a Jordan matrix with blocks of different sizes. Let me take a Jordan matrix J with eigenvalues 1, 1, 1, but with a Jordan block of size 2 and another of size 1. Then:

J = diag(J1, J2), where J1 is the 2x2 block and J2 is the 1x1 block. So,

J1 = [[1, 1], [0, 1]], J2 = [1]. Then J is:

[[1, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 is:

[[1^2, 2*1, 0],
 [0, 1^2, 0],
 [0, 0, 1^2]] = [[1, 2, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 - J = [[1 -1, 2 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 1 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 0 -0, 1 -1]] = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]. 

The eigenvalues of this matrix are all 0, which are real. 

Alternatively, if I take a Jordan block with eigenvalue 0. Let&#x27;s say J is a 2x2 Jordan block with 0 on the diagonal. Then J = [[0,1],[0,0]]. Then J^2 is [[0,0],[0,0]], so J^2 - J = -J, which has eigenvalues 0 and 0. Still real. 

Another case: take a diagonal matrix with real eigenvalues. Then obviously, A^2 - A is diagonal with entries \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), which are real. 

So in all these examples, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, is there a case where even though the original matrix has real eigenvalues, the polynomial transformation \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) could introduce complex eigenvalues? 

Wait, but \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is a real number if \( \lambda \) is real. So if all eigenvalues of A are real, then applying the function f(x) = x^2 - x to each eigenvalue would result in real numbers. Therefore, even if the matrix is not diagonalizable, since in its Jordan form, the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A. 

Wait, is that true? For functions applied to matrices, in the case of Jordan blocks, if you have a Jordan block with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) for a function f analytic (like a polynomial) would be upper triangular with f(λ) on the diagonal and the upper diagonals filled with derivatives or something? Wait, actually, for a Jordan block J with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) is a matrix where each entry is given by the Taylor expansion of f around λ. For example, if J is a Jordan block of size k, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ)/1! on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, etc., up to the (k-1)th superdiagonal. 

But in our case, f(x) = x^2 - x. Let&#x27;s compute f(J) for a Jordan block J. Let&#x27;s take a 2x2 Jordan block again. 

J = [[λ, 1], [0, λ]]

Then f(J) = J^2 - J. As computed earlier, this is:

[[λ^2 - λ, 2λ - 1], [0, λ^2 - λ]]

So the diagonal entries are f(λ) = λ^2 - λ, which is real if λ is real. The superdiagonal entries are f’(λ) * 1 (since derivative of x^2 - x is 2x -1, evaluated at λ, so 2λ -1). 

But regardless, the eigenvalues of f(J) are still the diagonal entries, which are f(λ), so they are real. For higher Jordan blocks, the same logic applies. If you have a Jordan block of size 3 with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ) on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, but the eigenvalues are still just f(λ) with multiplicity equal to the size of the block. 

Therefore, even in the case of a non-diagonalizable matrix, the eigenvalues of f(A) = A^2 - A are f(λ_i), which are real numbers since λ_i are real. Therefore, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

Therefore, the answer should be yes, it&#x27;s true that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me try to see if there&#x27;s any possible way that even with real eigenvalues of A, the eigenvalues of A^2 - A could become complex. But given that eigenvalues of A are real, then f(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real number for each eigenvalue. Since eigenvalues of A^2 - A are precisely f(λ_i) for each eigenvalue λ_i of A, then they have to be real. 

But wait, is this always the case? For any matrix A with real eigenvalues, even if it&#x27;s not diagonalizable, are the eigenvalues of f(A) just f(λ_i)? 

Yes, because the eigenvalues of f(A) are the same as applying f to each eigenvalue of A, counting algebraic multiplicities. This is a standard result in linear algebra. For any function f that is analytic (and polynomials are certainly analytic), the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A.

But p(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real polynomial, so if λ is real, then p(λ) is real. Therefore, regardless of the structure of A, the eigenvalues of p(A) must be real. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that yes, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real.

Let me consider the case where A is not diagonalizable. For example, take a Jordan block matrix with real eigenvalues. Suppose A is a 2x2 Jordan block with eigenvalue λ. Then A is upper triangular with λ on the diagonal and 1 above the diagonal. Let me compute \( A^2 - A \). 

Let&#x27;s take λ as a real number. The Jordan block J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 &amp; 2\lambda \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 \end{pmatrix} \). So \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 - \lambda &amp; 2\lambda - 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \). 

The eigenvalues of \( J^2 - J \) are just the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), repeated twice. Since λ is real, \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is real. So even if A is a Jordan block, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, what about the off-diagonal entry? If the Jordan block is 2x2, then \( J^2 - J \) is upper triangular with eigenvalues \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), but the off-diagonal entry is \( 2\lambda - 1 \). However, eigenvalues are determined by the characteristic equation, which for a triangular matrix is just the product of (t - a_ii). So even though there&#x27;s an entry above the diagonal, the eigenvalues are still the diagonal entries. Therefore, even in the non-diagonalizable case, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check with a specific example. Suppose λ = 1. Then J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} 1^2 - 1 &amp; 2*1 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 1^2 -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \). The eigenvalues of this matrix are 0 and 0, which are real. 

Another example, take λ = 2. Then J^2 - J would be:

\[ \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 2 &amp; 4 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 4 -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 3 \\ 0 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix} \]. The eigenvalues are both 2, which are real. 

So even in the Jordan block case, the eigenvalues remain real. Therefore, whether A is diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me think again. Suppose we have a general matrix A with real eigenvalues. Then A can be written in Jordan canonical form, which is upper triangular with real eigenvalues on the diagonal and possibly ones on the superdiagonal. Then \( A^2 - A \) would be upper triangular because the product and difference of upper triangular matrices are upper triangular. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), each of which is real because \( \lambda_i \) is real. 

Therefore, regardless of whether A is diagonalizable, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me check with another example. Suppose A is a 3x3 matrix with a more complicated Jordan structure. For example, a Jordan matrix with blocks of different sizes. Let me take a Jordan matrix J with eigenvalues 1, 1, 1, but with a Jordan block of size 2 and another of size 1. Then:

J = diag(J1, J2), where J1 is the 2x2 block and J2 is the 1x1 block. So,

J1 = [[1, 1], [0, 1]], J2 = [1]. Then J is:

[[1, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 is:

[[1^2, 2*1, 0],
 [0, 1^2, 0],
 [0, 0, 1^2]] = [[1, 2, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 - J = [[1 -1, 2 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 1 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 0 -0, 1 -1]] = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]. 

The eigenvalues of this matrix are all 0, which are real. 

Alternatively, if I take a Jordan block with eigenvalue 0. Let&#x27;s say J is a 2x2 Jordan block with 0 on the diagonal. Then J = [[0,1],[0,0]]. Then J^2 is [[0,0],[0,0]], so J^2 - J = -J, which has eigenvalues 0 and 0. Still real. 

Another case: take a diagonal matrix with real eigenvalues. Then obviously, A^2 - A is diagonal with entries \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), which are real. 

So in all these examples, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, is there a case where even though the original matrix has real eigenvalues, the polynomial transformation \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) could introduce complex eigenvalues? 

Wait, but \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is a real number if \( \lambda \) is real. So if all eigenvalues of A are real, then applying the function f(x) = x^2 - x to each eigenvalue would result in real numbers. Therefore, even if the matrix is not diagonalizable, since in its Jordan form, the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A. 

Wait, is that true? For functions applied to matrices, in the case of Jordan blocks, if you have a Jordan block with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) for a function f analytic (like a polynomial) would be upper triangular with f(λ) on the diagonal and the upper diagonals filled with derivatives or something? Wait, actually, for a Jordan block J with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) is a matrix where each entry is given by the Taylor expansion of f around λ. For example, if J is a Jordan block of size k, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ)/1! on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, etc., up to the (k-1)th superdiagonal. 

But in our case, f(x) = x^2 - x. Let&#x27;s compute f(J) for a Jordan block J. Let&#x27;s take a 2x2 Jordan block again. 

J = [[λ, 1], [0, λ]]

Then f(J) = J^2 - J. As computed earlier, this is:

[[λ^2 - λ, 2λ - 1], [0, λ^2 - λ]]

So the diagonal entries are f(λ) = λ^2 - λ, which is real if λ is real. The superdiagonal entries are f’(λ) * 1 (since derivative of x^2 - x is 2x -1, evaluated at λ, so 2λ -1). 

But regardless, the eigenvalues of f(J) are still the diagonal entries, which are f(λ), so they are real. For higher Jordan blocks, the same logic applies. If you have a Jordan block of size 3 with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ) on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, but the eigenvalues are still just f(λ) with multiplicity equal to the size of the block. 

Therefore, even in the case of a non-diagonalizable matrix, the eigenvalues of f(A) = A^2 - A are f(λ_i), which are real numbers since λ_i are real. Therefore, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

Therefore, the answer should be yes, it&#x27;s true that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me try to see if there&#x27;s any possible way that even with real eigenvalues of A, the eigenvalues of A^2 - A could become complex. But given that eigenvalues of A are real, then f(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real number for each eigenvalue. Since eigenvalues of A^2 - A are precisely f(λ_i) for each eigenvalue λ_i of A, then they have to be real. 

But wait, is this always the case? For any matrix A with real eigenvalues, even if it&#x27;s not diagonalizable, are the eigenvalues of f(A) just f(λ_i)? 

Yes, because the eigenvalues of f(A) are the same as applying f to each eigenvalue of A, counting algebraic multiplicities. This is a standard result in linear algebra. For any function f that is analytic (and polynomials are certainly analytic), the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A. 

Therefore, regardless of the structure of A (whether diagonalizable or not), if all eigenvalues of A are real, then applying the polynomial f(x) = x^2 - x to each eigenvalue will result in real numbers. Thus, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A must be real. 

Therefore, the statement is true. 

But wait, let me think of another angle. Suppose someone claims that even though eigenvalues are transformed by f, maybe when the matrix is defective (not diagonalizable), the eigenvalues could somehow become complex. But no, because the eigenvalues of a real matrix are either real or come in complex conjugate pairs. However, in this problem, A is given to have all real eigenvalues, so there are no complex eigenvalues to conjugate. Therefore, even if A is defective, the eigenvalues of f(A) are still the f(λ_i), which are real. 

Alternatively, consider the characteristic polynomial of A. If all eigenvalues of A are real, then the characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors over ℝ. Then, perhaps the characteristic polynomial of A^2 - A can be related to that of A. But this might be more complicated. 

Alternatively, using the concept of functional calculus: for any matrix A, if p is a polynomial, then the eigenvalues of p(A) are p(λ) where λ are eigenvalues of A. Therefore, since A has real eigenvalues, p(A) will have eigenvalues p(λ), which are real if p(λ) is real for all real λ. 

But p(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real polynomial, so if λ is real, then p(λ) is real. Therefore, regardless of the structure of A, the eigenvalues of p(A) must be real. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that yes, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

I can&#x27;t find any counterexamples, and all the reasoning points towards the eigenvalues being real. So I think the answer is that it is indeed true.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{True}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a matrix \( A \in M(n,\mathbb{R}) \) with all real eigenvalues, we need to determine if all the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are also real.

1. **Diagonalizable Case**: If \( A \) is diagonalizable, it can be written as \( A = PDP^{-1} \) where \( D \) is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. Then \( A^2 - A = P(D^2 - D)P^{-1} \). The eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) for each eigenvalue \( \lambda \) of \( A \), which are real since \( \lambda \) is real.

2. **Non-Diagonalizable Case**: If \( A \) is not diagonalizable, it can be written in Jordan canonical form. For a Jordan block \( J \) with eigenvalue \( \lambda \), \( J^2 - J \) is upper triangular with diagonal entries \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), which are real. The off-diagonal entries do not affect the eigenvalues, which remain on the diagonal.

3. **General Case**: For any matrix \( A \) with real eigenvalues, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are given by applying the function \( f(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - \lambda \) to each eigenvalue of \( A \). Since \( \lambda \) is real, \( f(\lambda) \) is real. This result holds for any Jordan block structure, confirming that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

4. **Conclusion**: The eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real because they are derived from real eigenvalues of \( A \) through the polynomial \( f(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - \lambda \), which preserves real numbers.

Thus, the statement is true.

Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this matrix problem here. Let me read it again: &quot;Let \( A \in M(n,\mathbb{R}) \) be a matrix with all real eigenvalues. Determine if it is true that all the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are also real.&quot; Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out whether squaring a matrix with real eigenvalues and then subtracting the matrix itself will result in a matrix that still has all real eigenvalues. 

First, let me recall some linear algebra concepts. If a matrix has all real eigenvalues, it&#x27;s called a real diagonalizable matrix, but wait, no, actually, diagonalizable matrices are those that can be written as PDP^{-1} where D is diagonal. But having all real eigenvalues doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the matrix is diagonalizable, right? For example, a Jordan block matrix has eigenvalues on the diagonal but is not diagonalizable if it has ones on the superdiagonal. So, the question doesn&#x27;t state that A is diagonalizable, just that all its eigenvalues are real. So A could be diagonalizable or not, but regardless, it&#x27;s a real matrix with real eigenvalues. 

Now, the problem is about the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \). Let me think. If A is diagonalizable, then it can be diagonalized as \( A = PDP^{-1} \), where D is a diagonal matrix with its eigenvalues on the diagonal. Then \( A^2 - A = PD^2P^{-1} - PDP^{-1} = P(D^2 - D)P^{-1} \). So the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) would be the diagonal entries of \( D^2 - D \), which are just \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) for each eigenvalue \( \lambda \) of A. Since all eigenvalues \( \lambda \) are real, then \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is also real. Therefore, if A is diagonalizable, then all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that A is diagonalizable. So even if A is not diagonalizable, does \( A^2 - A \) still have real eigenvalues? Hmm. Let me consider the case where A is not diagonalizable. For example, take a Jordan block matrix with real eigenvalues. Suppose A is a 2x2 Jordan block with eigenvalue λ. Then A is upper triangular with λ on the diagonal and 1 above the diagonal. Let me compute \( A^2 - A \). 

Let&#x27;s take λ as a real number. The Jordan block J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 &amp; 2\lambda \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 \end{pmatrix} \). So \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 - \lambda &amp; 2\lambda - 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \). 

The eigenvalues of \( J^2 - J \) are just the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), repeated twice. Since λ is real, \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is real. So even if A is a Jordan block, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, what about the off-diagonal entry? If the Jordan block is 2x2, then \( J^2 - J \) is upper triangular with eigenvalues \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), but the off-diagonal entry is \( 2\lambda - 1 \). However, eigenvalues are determined by the characteristic equation, which for a triangular matrix is just the product of (t - a_ii). So even though there&#x27;s an entry above the diagonal, the eigenvalues are still the diagonal entries. Therefore, even in the non-diagonalizable case, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check with a specific example. Suppose λ = 1. Then J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} 1^2 - 1 &amp; 2*1 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 1^2 -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \). The eigenvalues of this matrix are 0 and 0, which are real. 

Another example, take λ = 2. Then J^2 - J would be:

\[ \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 2 &amp; 4 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 4 -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 3 \\ 0 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix} \]. The eigenvalues are both 2, which are real. 

So even in the Jordan block case, the eigenvalues remain real. Therefore, whether A is diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me think again. Suppose we have a general matrix A with real eigenvalues. Then A can be written in Jordan canonical form, which is upper triangular with real eigenvalues on the diagonal and possibly ones on the superdiagonal. Then \( A^2 - A \) would be upper triangular because the product and difference of upper triangular matrices are upper triangular. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), each of which is real because \( \lambda_i \) is real. 

Therefore, regardless of whether A is diagonalizable, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me check with another example. Suppose A is a 3x3 matrix with a more complicated Jordan structure. For example, a Jordan matrix with blocks of different sizes. Let me take a Jordan matrix J with eigenvalues 1, 1, 1, but with a Jordan block of size 2 and another of size 1. Then:

J = diag(J1, J2), where J1 is the 2x2 block and J2 is the 1x1 block. So,

J1 = [[1, 1], [0, 1]], J2 = [1]. Then J is:

[[1, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 is:

[[1^2, 2*1, 0],
 [0, 1^2, 0],
 [0, 0, 1^2]] = [[1, 2, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 - J = [[1 -1, 2 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 1 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 0 -0, 1 -1]] = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]. 

The eigenvalues of this matrix are all 0, which are real. 

Alternatively, if I take a Jordan block with eigenvalue 0. Let&#x27;s say J is a 2x2 Jordan block with 0 on the diagonal. Then J = [[0,1],[0,0]]. Then J^2 is [[0,0],[0,0]], so J^2 - J = -J, which has eigenvalues 0 and 0. Still real. 

Another case: take a diagonal matrix with real eigenvalues. Then obviously, A^2 - A is diagonal with entries \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), which are real. 

So in all these examples, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, is there a case where even though the original matrix has real eigenvalues, the polynomial transformation \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) could introduce complex eigenvalues? 

Wait, but \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is a real number if \( \lambda \) is real. So if all eigenvalues of A are real, then applying the function f(x) = x^2 - x to each eigenvalue would result in real numbers. Therefore, even if the matrix is not diagonalizable, since in its Jordan form, the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A. 

Wait, is that true? For functions applied to matrices, in the case of Jordan blocks, if you have a Jordan block with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) for a function f analytic (like a polynomial) would be upper triangular with f(λ) on the diagonal and the upper diagonals filled with derivatives or something? Wait, actually, for a Jordan block J with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) is a matrix where each entry is given by the Taylor expansion of f around λ. For example, if J is a Jordan block of size k, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ)/1! on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, etc., up to the (k-1)th superdiagonal. 

But in our case, f(x) = x^2 - x. Let&#x27;s compute f(J) for a Jordan block J. Let&#x27;s take a 2x2 Jordan block again. 

J = [[λ, 1], [0, λ]]

Then f(J) = J^2 - J. As computed earlier, this is:

[[λ^2 - λ, 2λ - 1], [0, λ^2 - λ]]

So the diagonal entries are f(λ) = λ^2 - λ, which is real if λ is real. The superdiagonal entries are f’(λ) * 1 (since derivative of x^2 - x is 2x -1, evaluated at λ, so 2λ -1). 

But regardless, the eigenvalues of f(J) are still the diagonal entries, which are f(λ), so they are real. For higher Jordan blocks, the same logic applies. If you have a Jordan block of size 3 with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ) on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, but the eigenvalues are still just f(λ) with multiplicity equal to the size of the block. 

Therefore, even in the case of a non-diagonalizable matrix, the eigenvalues of f(A) = A^2 - A are f(λ_i), which are real numbers since λ_i are real. Therefore, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

Therefore, the answer should be yes, it&#x27;s true that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me try to see if there&#x27;s any possible way that even with real eigenvalues of A, the eigenvalues of A^2 - A could become complex.

Yes, because the eigenvalues of f(A) are the same as applying f to each eigenvalue of A, counting algebraic multiplicities. This is a standard result in linear algebra.

But p(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real polynomial, so if λ is real, then p(λ) is real. Therefore, regardless of the structure of A, the eigenvalues of p(A) must be real. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that yes, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real.

Then A is upper triangular with λ on the diagonal and 1 above the diagonal. Let me compute \( A^2 - A \). 

Let&#x27;s take λ as a real number. The Jordan block J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 &amp; 2\lambda \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 \end{pmatrix} \). So \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 - \lambda &amp; 2\lambda - 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \). 

The eigenvalues of \( J^2 - J \) are just the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), repeated twice. Since λ is real, \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is real. So even if A is a Jordan block, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, what about the off-diagonal entry? If the Jordan block is 2x2, then \( J^2 - J \) is upper triangular with eigenvalues \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), but the off-diagonal entry is \( 2\lambda - 1 \).

Then \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} 1^2 - 1 &amp; 2*1 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 1^2 -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \). The eigenvalues of this matrix are 0 and 0, which are real. 

Another example, take λ = 2. Then J^2 - J would be:

\[ \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 2 &amp; 4 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 4 -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 3 \\ 0 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix} \]. The eigenvalues are both 2, which are real. 

So even in the Jordan block case, the eigenvalues remain real. Therefore, whether A is diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

Then A can be written in Jordan canonical form, which is upper triangular with real eigenvalues on the diagonal and possibly ones on the superdiagonal.

J1 = [[1, 1], [0, 1]], J2 = [1]. Then J is:

 [0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 is:

[[1^2, 2*1, 0],
 [0, 1^2, 0],
 [0, 0, 1^2]] = [[1, 2, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 - J = [[1 -1, 2 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 1 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 0 -0, 1 -1]] = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]. 

The eigenvalues of this matrix are all 0, which are real. 

Alternatively, if I take a Jordan block with eigenvalue 0. Let&#x27;s say J is a 2x2 Jordan block with 0 on the diagonal. Then J = [[0,1],[0,0]]. Then J^2 is [[0,0],[0,0]], so J^2 - J = -J, which has eigenvalues 0 and 0. Still real. 

Another case: take a diagonal matrix with real eigenvalues. Then obviously, A^2 - A is diagonal with entries \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), which are real. 

So in all these examples, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, is there a case where even though the original matrix has real eigenvalues, the polynomial transformation \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) could introduce complex eigenvalues? 

Wait, but \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is a real number if \( \lambda \) is real. So if all eigenvalues of A are real, then applying the function f(x) = x^2 - x to each eigenvalue would result in real numbers. Therefore, even if the matrix is not diagonalizable, since in its Jordan form, the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A. 

Wait, is that true? For functions applied to matrices, in the case of Jordan blocks, if you have a Jordan block with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) for a function f analytic (like a polynomial) would be upper triangular with f(λ) on the diagonal and the upper diagonals filled with derivatives or something? Wait, actually, for a Jordan block J with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) is a matrix where each entry is given by the Taylor expansion of f around λ. For example, if J is a Jordan block of size k, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ)/1! on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, etc., up to the (k-1)th superdiagonal. 

But in our case, f(x) = x^2 - x. Let&#x27;s compute f(J) for a Jordan block J. Let&#x27;s take a 2x2 Jordan block again. 

J = [[λ, 1], [0, λ]]

Then f(J) = J^2 - J. As computed earlier, this is:

[[λ^2 - λ, 2λ - 1], [0, λ^2 - λ]]

So the diagonal entries are f(λ) = λ^2 - λ, which is real if λ is real. The superdiagonal entries are f’(λ) * 1 (since derivative of x^2 - x is 2x -1, evaluated at λ, so 2λ -1). 

But regardless, the eigenvalues of f(J) are still the diagonal entries, which are f(λ), so they are real. For higher Jordan blocks, the same logic applies. If you have a Jordan block of size 3 with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ) on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, but the eigenvalues are still just f(λ) with multiplicity equal to the size of the block. 

Therefore, even in the case of a non-diagonalizable matrix, the eigenvalues of f(A) = A^2 - A are f(λ_i), which are real numbers since λ_i are real. Therefore, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

Therefore, the answer should be yes, it&#x27;s true that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me try to see if there&#x27;s any possible way that even with real eigenvalues of A, the eigenvalues of A^2 - A could become complex. But given that eigenvalues of A are real, then f(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real number for each eigenvalue. Since eigenvalues of A^2 - A are precisely f(λ_i) for each eigenvalue λ_i of A, then they have to be real. 

But wait, is this always the case? For any matrix A with real eigenvalues, even if it&#x27;s not diagonalizable, are the eigenvalues of f(A) just f(λ_i)? 

Yes, because the eigenvalues of f(A) are the same as applying f to each eigenvalue of A, counting algebraic multiplicities. This is a standard result in linear algebra. For any function f that is analytic (and polynomials are certainly analytic), the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A. 

Therefore, regardless of the structure of A (whether diagonalizable or not), if all eigenvalues of A are real, then applying the polynomial f(x) = x^2 - x to each eigenvalue will result in real numbers. Thus, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A must be real. 

Therefore, the statement is true. 

But wait, let me think of another angle. Suppose someone claims that even though eigenvalues are transformed by f, maybe when the matrix is defective (not diagonalizable), the eigenvalues could somehow become complex. But no, because the eigenvalues of a real matrix are either real or come in complex conjugate pairs. However, in this problem, A is given to have all real eigenvalues, so there are no complex eigenvalues to conjugate. Therefore, even if A is defective, the eigenvalues of f(A) are still the f(λ_i), which are real. 

Alternatively, consider the characteristic polynomial of A. If all eigenvalues of A are real, then the characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors over ℝ. Then, perhaps the characteristic polynomial of A^2 - A can be related to that of A. But this might be more complicated. 

Alternatively, using the concept of functional calculus: for any matrix A, if p is a polynomial, then the eigenvalues of p(A) are p(λ) where λ are eigenvalues of A. Therefore, since A has real eigenvalues, p(A) will have eigenvalues p(λ), which are real if p(λ) is real for all real λ. 

But p(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real polynomial, so if λ is real, then p(λ) is real. Therefore, regardless of the structure of A, the eigenvalues of p(A) must be real. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that yes, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

I can&#x27;t find any counterexamples, and all the reasoning points towards the eigenvalues being real. So I think the answer is that it is indeed true.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{True}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a matrix \( A \in M(n,\mathbb{R}) \) with all real eigenvalues, we need to determine if all the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are also real.

1. **Diagonalizable Case**: If \( A \) is diagonalizable, it can be written as \( A = PDP^{-1} \) where \( D \) is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. Then \( A^2 - A = P(D^2 - D)P^{-1} \). The eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) for each eigenvalue \( \lambda \) of \( A \), which are real since \( \lambda \) is real.

2. **Non-Diagonalizable Case**: If \( A \) is not diagonalizable, it can be written in Jordan canonical form. For a Jordan block \( J \) with eigenvalue \( \lambda \), \( J^2 - J \) is upper triangular with diagonal entries \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), which are real. The off-diagonal entries do not affect the eigenvalues, which remain on the diagonal.

3. **General Case**: For any matrix \( A \) with real eigenvalues, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are given by applying the function \( f(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - \lambda \) to each eigenvalue of \( A \). Since \( \lambda \) is real, \( f(\lambda) \) is real. This result holds for any Jordan block structure, confirming that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

4. **Conclusion**: The eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real because they are derived from real eigenvalues of \( A \) through the polynomial \( f(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - \lambda \), which preserves real numbers.

Thus, the statement is true.

Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this matrix problem here. Let me read it again: &quot;Let \( A \in M(n,\mathbb{R}) \) be a matrix with all real eigenvalues. Determine if it is true that all the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are also real.&quot; Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out whether squaring a matrix with real eigenvalues and then subtracting the matrix itself will result in a matrix that still has all real eigenvalues. 

First, let me recall some linear algebra concepts. If a matrix has all real eigenvalues, it&#x27;s called a real diagonalizable matrix, but wait, no, actually, diagonalizable matrices are those that can be written as PDP^{-1} where D is diagonal. But having all real eigenvalues doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the matrix is diagonalizable, right? For example, a Jordan block matrix has eigenvalues on the diagonal but is not diagonalizable if it has ones on the superdiagonal. So, the question doesn&#x27;t state that A is diagonalizable, just that all its eigenvalues are real. So A could be diagonalizable or not, but regardless, it&#x27;s a real matrix with real eigenvalues. 

Now, the problem is about the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \). Let me think. If A is diagonalizable, then it can be diagonalized as \( A = PDP^{-1} \), where D is a diagonal matrix with its eigenvalues on the diagonal. Then \( A^2 - A = PD^2P^{-1} - PDP^{-1} = P(D^2 - D)P^{-1} \). So the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) would be the diagonal entries of \( D^2 - D \), which are just \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) for each eigenvalue \( \lambda \) of A. Since all eigenvalues \( \lambda \) are real, then \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is also real. Therefore, if A is diagonalizable, then all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that A is diagonalizable. So even if A is not diagonalizable, does \( A^2 - A \) still have real eigenvalues? Hmm. Let me consider the case where A is not diagonalizable. For example, take a Jordan block matrix with real eigenvalues. Suppose A is a 2x2 Jordan block with eigenvalue λ. Then A is upper triangular with λ on the diagonal and 1 above the diagonal. Let me compute \( A^2 - A \). 

Let&#x27;s take λ as a real number. The Jordan block J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 &amp; 2\lambda \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 \end{pmatrix} \). So \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 - \lambda &amp; 2\lambda - 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \). 

The eigenvalues of \( J^2 - J \) are just the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), repeated twice. Since λ is real, \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is real. So even if A is a Jordan block, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, what about the off-diagonal entry? If the Jordan block is 2x2, then \( J^2 - J \) is upper triangular with eigenvalues \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), but the off-diagonal entry is \( 2\lambda - 1 \). However, eigenvalues are determined by the characteristic equation, which for a triangular matrix is just the product of (t - a_ii). So even though there&#x27;s an entry above the diagonal, the eigenvalues are still the diagonal entries. Therefore, even in the non-diagonalizable case, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check with a specific example. Suppose λ = 1. Then J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} 1^2 - 1 &amp; 2*1 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 1^2 -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \). The eigenvalues of this matrix are 0 and 0, which are real. 

Another example, take λ = 2. Then J^2 - J would be:

\[ \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 2 &amp; 4 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 4 -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 3 \\ 0 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix} \]. The eigenvalues are both 2, which are real. 

So even in the Jordan block case, the eigenvalues remain real. Therefore, whether A is diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me think again. Suppose we have a general matrix A with real eigenvalues. Then A can be written in Jordan canonical form, which is upper triangular with real eigenvalues on the diagonal and possibly ones on the superdiagonal. Then \( A^2 - A \) would be upper triangular because the product and difference of upper triangular matrices are upper triangular. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), each of which is real because \( \lambda_i \) is real. 

Therefore, regardless of whether A is diagonalizable, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me check with another example. Suppose A is a 3x3 matrix with a more complicated Jordan structure. For example, a Jordan matrix with blocks of different sizes. Let me take a Jordan matrix J with eigenvalues 1, 1, 1, but with a Jordan block of size 2 and another of size 1. Then:

J = diag(J1, J2), where J1 is the 2x2 block and J2 is the 1x1 block. So,

J1 = [[1, 1], [0, 1]], J2 = [1]. Then J is:

[[1, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 is:

[[1^2, 2*1, 0],
 [0, 1^2, 0],
 [0, 0, 1^2]] = [[1, 2, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 - J = [[1 -1, 2 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 1 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 0 -0, 1 -1]] = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]. 

The eigenvalues of this matrix are all 0, which are real. 

Alternatively, if I take a Jordan block with eigenvalue 0. Let&#x27;s say J is a 2x2 Jordan block with 0 on the diagonal. Then J = [[0,1],[0,0]]. Then J^2 is [[0,0],[0,0]], so J^2 - J = -J, which has eigenvalues 0 and 0. Still real. 

Another case: take a diagonal matrix with real eigenvalues. Then obviously, A^2 - A is diagonal with entries \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), which are real. 

So in all these examples, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, is there a case where even though the original matrix has real eigenvalues, the polynomial transformation \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) could introduce complex eigenvalues? 

Wait, but \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is a real number if \( \lambda \) is real. So if all eigenvalues of A are real, then applying the function f(x) = x^2 - x to each eigenvalue would result in real numbers. Therefore, even if the matrix is not diagonalizable, since in its Jordan form, the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A. 

Wait, is that true? For functions applied to matrices, in the case of Jordan blocks, if you have a Jordan block with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) for a function f analytic (like a polynomial) would be upper triangular with f(λ) on the diagonal and the upper diagonals filled with derivatives or something? Wait, actually, for a Jordan block J with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) is a matrix where each entry is given by the Taylor expansion of f around λ. For example, if J is a Jordan block of size k, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ)/1! on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, etc., up to the (k-1)th superdiagonal. 

But in our case, f(x) = x^2 - x. Let&#x27;s compute f(J) for a Jordan block J. Let&#x27;s take a 2x2 Jordan block again. 

J = [[λ, 1], [0, λ]]

Then f(J) = J^2 - J. As computed earlier, this is:

[[λ^2 - λ, 2λ - 1], [0, λ^2 - λ]]

So the diagonal entries are f(λ) = λ^2 - λ, which is real if λ is real. The superdiagonal entries are f’(λ) * 1 (since derivative of x^2 - x is 2x -1, evaluated at λ, so 2λ -1). 

But regardless, the eigenvalues of f(J) are still the diagonal entries, which are f(λ), so they are real. For higher Jordan blocks, the same logic applies.

Therefore, even in the case of a non-diagonalizable matrix, the eigenvalues of f(A) = A^2 - A are f(λ_i), which are real numbers since λ_i are real. Therefore, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

Therefore, the answer should be yes, it&#x27;s true that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

Let&#x27;s take λ as a real number. The Jordan block J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 &amp; 2\lambda \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 \end{pmatrix} \). So \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 - \lambda &amp; 2\lambda - 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \). 

The eigenvalues of \( J^2 - J \) are just the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), repeated twice. Since λ is real, \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is real. So even if A is a Jordan block, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

 [0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 is:

[[1^2, 2*1, 0],
 [0, 1^2, 0],
 [0, 0, 1^2]] = [[1, 2, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 - J = [[1 -1, 2 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 1 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 0 -0, 1 -1]] = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]. 

The eigenvalues of this matrix are all 0, which are real. 

Alternatively, if I take a Jordan block with eigenvalue 0. Let&#x27;s say J is a 2x2 Jordan block with 0 on the diagonal. Then J = [[0,1],[0,0]]. Then J^2 is [[0,0],[0,0]], so J^2 - J = -J, which has eigenvalues 0 and 0. Still real. 

Another case: take a diagonal matrix with real eigenvalues. Then obviously, A^2 - A is diagonal with entries \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), which are real. 

So in all these examples, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, is there a case where even though the original matrix has real eigenvalues, the polynomial transformation \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) could introduce complex eigenvalues? 

Wait, but \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is a real number if \( \lambda \) is real. So if all eigenvalues of A are real, then applying the function f(x) = x^2 - x to each eigenvalue would result in real numbers. Therefore, even if the matrix is not diagonalizable, since in its Jordan form, the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A. 

Wait, is that true? For functions applied to matrices, in the case of Jordan blocks, if you have a Jordan block with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) for a function f analytic (like a polynomial) would be upper triangular with f(λ) on the diagonal and the upper diagonals filled with derivatives or something? Wait, actually, for a Jordan block J with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) is a matrix where each entry is given by the Taylor expansion of f around λ. For example, if J is a Jordan block of size k, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ)/1! on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, etc., up to the (k-1)th superdiagonal. 

But in our case, f(x) = x^2 - x. Let&#x27;s compute f(J) for a Jordan block J. Let&#x27;s take a 2x2 Jordan block again. 

J = [[λ, 1], [0, λ]]

Then f(J) = J^2 - J. As computed earlier, this is:

[[λ^2 - λ, 2λ - 1], [0, λ^2 - λ]]

So the diagonal entries are f(λ) = λ^2 - λ, which is real if λ is real. The superdiagonal entries are f’(λ) * 1 (since derivative of x^2 - x is 2x -1, evaluated at λ, so 2λ -1). 

But regardless, the eigenvalues of f(J) are still the diagonal entries, which are f(λ), so they are real. For higher Jordan blocks, the same logic applies. If you have a Jordan block of size 3 with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ) on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, but the eigenvalues are still just f(λ) with multiplicity equal to the size of the block. 

Therefore, even in the case of a non-diagonalizable matrix, the eigenvalues of f(A) = A^2 - A are f(λ_i), which are real numbers since λ_i are real. Therefore, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

Therefore, the answer should be yes, it&#x27;s true that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me try to see if there&#x27;s any possible way that even with real eigenvalues of A, the eigenvalues of A^2 - A could become complex. But given that eigenvalues of A are real, then f(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real number for each eigenvalue. Since eigenvalues of A^2 - A are precisely f(λ_i) for each eigenvalue λ_i of A, then they have to be real. 

But wait, is this always the case? For any matrix A with real eigenvalues, even if it&#x27;s not diagonalizable, are the eigenvalues of f(A) just f(λ_i)? 

Yes, because the eigenvalues of f(A) are the same as applying f to each eigenvalue of A, counting algebraic multiplicities. This is a standard result in linear algebra. For any function f that is analytic (and polynomials are certainly analytic), the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A. 

Therefore, regardless of the structure of A (whether diagonalizable or not), if all eigenvalues of A are real, then applying the polynomial f(x) = x^2 - x to each eigenvalue will result in real numbers. Thus, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A must be real. 

Therefore, the statement is true. 

But wait, let me think of another angle. Suppose someone claims that even though eigenvalues are transformed by f, maybe when the matrix is defective (not diagonalizable), the eigenvalues could somehow become complex. But no, because the eigenvalues of a real matrix are either real or come in complex conjugate pairs. However, in this problem, A is given to have all real eigenvalues, so there are no complex eigenvalues to conjugate. Therefore, even if A is defective, the eigenvalues of f(A) are still the f(λ_i), which are real. 

Alternatively, consider the characteristic polynomial of A. If all eigenvalues of A are real, then the characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors over ℝ. Then, perhaps the characteristic polynomial of A^2 - A can be related to that of A. But this might be more complicated. 

Alternatively, using the concept of functional calculus: for any matrix A, if p is a polynomial, then the eigenvalues of p(A) are p(λ) where λ are eigenvalues of A. Therefore, since A has real eigenvalues, p(A) will have eigenvalues p(λ), which are real if p(λ) is real for all real λ. 

But p(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real polynomial, so if λ is real, then p(λ) is real. Therefore, regardless of the structure of A, the eigenvalues of p(A) must be real. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that yes, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

I can&#x27;t find any counterexamples, and all the reasoning points towards the eigenvalues being real. So I think the answer is that it is indeed true.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{True}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a matrix \( A \in M(n,\mathbb{R}) \) with all real eigenvalues, we need to determine if all the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are also real.

1. **Diagonalizable Case**: If \( A \) is diagonalizable, it can be written as \( A = PDP^{-1} \) where \( D \) is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. Then \( A^2 - A = P(D^2 - D)P^{-1} \). The eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) for each eigenvalue \( \lambda \) of \( A \), which are real since \( \lambda \) is real.

2. **Non-Diagonalizable Case**: If \( A \) is not diagonalizable, it can be written in Jordan canonical form. For a Jordan block \( J \) with eigenvalue \( \lambda \), \( J^2 - J \) is upper triangular with diagonal entries \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), which are real. The off-diagonal entries do not affect the eigenvalues, which remain on the diagonal.

3. **General Case**: For any matrix \( A \) with real eigenvalues, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are given by applying the function \( f(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - \lambda \) to each eigenvalue of \( A \). Since \( \lambda \) is real, \( f(\lambda) \) is real. This result holds for any Jordan block structure, confirming that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

4. **Conclusion**: The eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real because they are derived from real eigenvalues of \( A \) through the polynomial \( f(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - \lambda \), which preserves real numbers.

Thus, the statement is true.

Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this matrix problem here. Let me read it again: &quot;Let \( A \in M(n,\mathbb{R}) \) be a matrix with all real eigenvalues. Determine if it is true that all the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are also real.&quot; Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out whether squaring a matrix with real eigenvalues and then subtracting the matrix itself will result in a matrix that still has all real eigenvalues. 

First, let me recall some linear algebra concepts. If a matrix has all real eigenvalues, it&#x27;s called a real diagonalizable matrix, but wait, no, actually, diagonalizable matrices are those that can be written as PDP^{-1} where D is diagonal. But having all real eigenvalues doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the matrix is diagonalizable, right? For example, a Jordan block matrix has eigenvalues on the diagonal but is not diagonalizable if it has ones on the superdiagonal. So, the question doesn&#x27;t state that A is diagonalizable, just that all its eigenvalues are real. So A could be diagonalizable or not, but regardless, it&#x27;s a real matrix with real eigenvalues. 

Now, the problem is about the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \). Let me think. If A is diagonalizable, then it can be diagonalized as \( A = PDP^{-1} \), where D is a diagonal matrix with its eigenvalues on the diagonal. Then \( A^2 - A = PD^2P^{-1} - PDP^{-1} = P(D^2 - D)P^{-1} \). So the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) would be the diagonal entries of \( D^2 - D \), which are just \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) for each eigenvalue \( \lambda \) of A. Since all eigenvalues \( \lambda \) are real, then \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is also real. Therefore, if A is diagonalizable, then all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that A is diagonalizable. So even if A is not diagonalizable, does \( A^2 - A \) still have real eigenvalues? Hmm. Let me consider the case where A is not diagonalizable. For example, take a Jordan block matrix with real eigenvalues. Suppose A is a 2x2 Jordan block with eigenvalue λ. Then A is upper triangular with λ on the diagonal and 1 above the diagonal. Let me compute \( A^2 - A \). 

Let&#x27;s take λ as a real number. The Jordan block J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 &amp; 2\lambda \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 \end{pmatrix} \). So \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 - \lambda &amp; 2\lambda - 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \). 

The eigenvalues of \( J^2 - J \) are just the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), repeated twice. Since λ is real, \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is real. So even if A is a Jordan block, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, what about the off-diagonal entry? If the Jordan block is 2x2, then \( J^2 - J \) is upper triangular with eigenvalues \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), but the off-diagonal entry is \( 2\lambda - 1 \). However, eigenvalues are determined by the characteristic equation, which for a triangular matrix is just the product of (t - a_ii). So even though there&#x27;s an entry above the diagonal, the eigenvalues are still the diagonal entries. Therefore, even in the non-diagonalizable case, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check with a specific example. Suppose λ = 1. Then J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} 1^2 - 1 &amp; 2*1 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 1^2 -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \). The eigenvalues of this matrix are 0 and 0, which are real. 

Another example, take λ = 2. Then J^2 - J would be:

\[ \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 2 &amp; 4 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 4 -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 3 \\ 0 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix} \]. The eigenvalues are both 2, which are real. 

So even in the Jordan block case, the eigenvalues remain real. Therefore, whether A is diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me think again. Suppose we have a general matrix A with real eigenvalues. Then A can be written in Jordan canonical form, which is upper triangular with real eigenvalues on the diagonal and possibly ones on the superdiagonal. Then \( A^2 - A \) would be upper triangular because the product and difference of upper triangular matrices are upper triangular. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), each of which is real because \( \lambda_i \) is real. 

Therefore, regardless of whether A is diagonalizable, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me check with another example. Suppose A is a 3x3 matrix with a more complicated Jordan structure. For example, a Jordan matrix with blocks of different sizes. Let me take a Jordan matrix J with eigenvalues 1, 1, 1, but with a Jordan block of size 2 and another of size 1. Then:

J = diag(J1, J2), where J1 is the 2x2 block and J2 is the 1x1 block. So,

J1 = [[1, 1], [0, 1]], J2 = [1]. Then J is:

[[1, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 is:

[[1^2, 2*1, 0],
 [0, 1^2, 0],
 [0, 0, 1^2]] = [[1, 2, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 - J = [[1 -1, 2 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 1 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 0 -0, 1 -1]] = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]. 

The eigenvalues of this matrix are all 0, which are real. 

Alternatively, if I take a Jordan block with eigenvalue 0. Let&#x27;s say J is a 2x2 Jordan block with 0 on the diagonal. Then J = [[0,1],[0,0]]. Then J^2 is [[0,0],[0,0]], so J^2 - J = -J, which has eigenvalues 0 and 0. Still real. 

Another case: take a diagonal matrix with real eigenvalues. Then obviously, A^2 - A is diagonal with entries \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), which are real. 

So in all these examples, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, is there a case where even though the original matrix has real eigenvalues, the polynomial transformation \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) could introduce complex eigenvalues? 

Wait, but \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is a real number if \( \lambda \) is real. So if all eigenvalues of A are real, then applying the function f(x) = x^2 - x to each eigenvalue would result in real numbers. Therefore, even if the matrix is not diagonalizable, since in its Jordan form, the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A. 

Wait, is that true? For functions applied to matrices, in the case of Jordan blocks, if you have a Jordan block with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) for a function f analytic (like a polynomial) would be upper triangular with f(λ) on the diagonal and the upper diagonals filled with derivatives or something? Wait, actually, for a Jordan block J with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) is a matrix where each entry is given by the Taylor expansion of f around λ. For example, if J is a Jordan block of size k, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ)/1! on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, etc., up to the (k-1)th superdiagonal. 

But in our case, f(x) = x^2 - x. Let&#x27;s compute f(J) for a Jordan block J. Let&#x27;s take a 2x2 Jordan block again. 

J = [[λ, 1], [0, λ]]

Then f(J) = J^2 - J. As computed earlier, this is:

[[λ^2 - λ, 2λ - 1], [0, λ^2 - λ]]

So the diagonal entries are f(λ) = λ^2 - λ, which is real if λ is real. The superdiagonal entries are f’(λ) * 1 (since derivative of x^2 - x is 2x -1, evaluated at λ, so 2λ -1). 

But regardless, the eigenvalues of f(J) are still the diagonal entries, which are f(λ), so they are real. For higher Jordan blocks, the same logic applies. If you have a Jordan block of size 3 with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ) on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, but the eigenvalues are still just f(λ) with multiplicity equal to the size of the block. 

Therefore, even in the case of a non-diagonalizable matrix, the eigenvalues of f(A) = A^2 - A are f(λ_i), which are real numbers since λ_i are real. Therefore, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

Therefore, the answer should be yes, it&#x27;s true that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

But p(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real polynomial, so if λ is real, then p(λ) is real. Therefore, regardless of the structure of A, the eigenvalues of p(A) must be real. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that yes, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real.

Let&#x27;s take λ as a real number. The Jordan block J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 &amp; 2\lambda \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 \end{pmatrix} \). So \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 - \lambda &amp; 2\lambda - 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \). 

The eigenvalues of \( J^2 - J \) are just the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), repeated twice. Since λ is real, \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is real. So even if A is a Jordan block, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

Another example, take λ = 2. Then J^2 - J would be:

\[ \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 2 &amp; 4 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 4 -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 3 \\ 0 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix} \]. The eigenvalues are both 2, which are real.

J1 = [[1, 1], [0, 1]], J2 = [1]. Then J is:

[[1, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 is:

[[1^2, 2*1, 0],
 [0, 1^2, 0],
 [0, 0, 1^2]] = [[1, 2, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 - J = [[1 -1, 2 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 1 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 0 -0, 1 -1]] = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]. 

The eigenvalues of this matrix are all 0, which are real. 

Alternatively, if I take a Jordan block with eigenvalue 0. Let&#x27;s say J is a 2x2 Jordan block with 0 on the diagonal. Then J = [[0,1],[0,0]]. Then J^2 is [[0,0],[0,0]], so J^2 - J = -J, which has eigenvalues 0 and 0. Still real. 

Another case: take a diagonal matrix with real eigenvalues. Then obviously, A^2 - A is diagonal with entries \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), which are real. 

So in all these examples, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, is there a case where even though the original matrix has real eigenvalues, the polynomial transformation \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) could introduce complex eigenvalues? 

Wait, but \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is a real number if \( \lambda \) is real. So if all eigenvalues of A are real, then applying the function f(x) = x^2 - x to each eigenvalue would result in real numbers. Therefore, even if the matrix is not diagonalizable, since in its Jordan form, the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A. 

Wait, is that true? For functions applied to matrices, in the case of Jordan blocks, if you have a Jordan block with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) for a function f analytic (like a polynomial) would be upper triangular with f(λ) on the diagonal and the upper diagonals filled with derivatives or something? Wait, actually, for a Jordan block J with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) is a matrix where each entry is given by the Taylor expansion of f around λ. For example, if J is a Jordan block of size k, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ)/1! on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, etc., up to the (k-1)th superdiagonal. 

But in our case, f(x) = x^2 - x. Let&#x27;s compute f(J) for a Jordan block J. Let&#x27;s take a 2x2 Jordan block again. 

J = [[λ, 1], [0, λ]]

Then f(J) = J^2 - J. As computed earlier, this is:

[[λ^2 - λ, 2λ - 1], [0, λ^2 - λ]]

So the diagonal entries are f(λ) = λ^2 - λ, which is real if λ is real. The superdiagonal entries are f’(λ) * 1 (since derivative of x^2 - x is 2x -1, evaluated at λ, so 2λ -1). 

But regardless, the eigenvalues of f(J) are still the diagonal entries, which are f(λ), so they are real. For higher Jordan blocks, the same logic applies. If you have a Jordan block of size 3 with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ) on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, but the eigenvalues are still just f(λ) with multiplicity equal to the size of the block. 

Therefore, even in the case of a non-diagonalizable matrix, the eigenvalues of f(A) = A^2 - A are f(λ_i), which are real numbers since λ_i are real. Therefore, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

Therefore, the answer should be yes, it&#x27;s true that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me try to see if there&#x27;s any possible way that even with real eigenvalues of A, the eigenvalues of A^2 - A could become complex. But given that eigenvalues of A are real, then f(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real number for each eigenvalue. Since eigenvalues of A^2 - A are precisely f(λ_i) for each eigenvalue λ_i of A, then they have to be real. 

But wait, is this always the case? For any matrix A with real eigenvalues, even if it&#x27;s not diagonalizable, are the eigenvalues of f(A) just f(λ_i)? 

Yes, because the eigenvalues of f(A) are the same as applying f to each eigenvalue of A, counting algebraic multiplicities. This is a standard result in linear algebra. For any function f that is analytic (and polynomials are certainly analytic), the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A. 

Therefore, regardless of the structure of A (whether diagonalizable or not), if all eigenvalues of A are real, then applying the polynomial f(x) = x^2 - x to each eigenvalue will result in real numbers. Thus, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A must be real. 

Therefore, the statement is true. 

But wait, let me think of another angle. Suppose someone claims that even though eigenvalues are transformed by f, maybe when the matrix is defective (not diagonalizable), the eigenvalues could somehow become complex. But no, because the eigenvalues of a real matrix are either real or come in complex conjugate pairs. However, in this problem, A is given to have all real eigenvalues, so there are no complex eigenvalues to conjugate. Therefore, even if A is defective, the eigenvalues of f(A) are still the f(λ_i), which are real. 

Alternatively, consider the characteristic polynomial of A. If all eigenvalues of A are real, then the characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors over ℝ. Then, perhaps the characteristic polynomial of A^2 - A can be related to that of A. But this might be more complicated. 

Alternatively, using the concept of functional calculus: for any matrix A, if p is a polynomial, then the eigenvalues of p(A) are p(λ) where λ are eigenvalues of A. Therefore, since A has real eigenvalues, p(A) will have eigenvalues p(λ), which are real if p(λ) is real for all real λ. 

But p(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real polynomial, so if λ is real, then p(λ) is real. Therefore, regardless of the structure of A, the eigenvalues of p(A) must be real. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that yes, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

I can&#x27;t find any counterexamples, and all the reasoning points towards the eigenvalues being real. So I think the answer is that it is indeed true.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{True}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a matrix \( A \in M(n,\mathbb{R}) \) with all real eigenvalues, we need to determine if all the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are also real.

1. **Diagonalizable Case**: If \( A \) is diagonalizable, it can be written as \( A = PDP^{-1} \) where \( D \) is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. Then \( A^2 - A = P(D^2 - D)P^{-1} \). The eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) for each eigenvalue \( \lambda \) of \( A \), which are real since \( \lambda \) is real.

2. **Non-Diagonalizable Case**: If \( A \) is not diagonalizable, it can be written in Jordan canonical form. For a Jordan block \( J \) with eigenvalue \( \lambda \), \( J^2 - J \) is upper triangular with diagonal entries \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), which are real. The off-diagonal entries do not affect the eigenvalues, which remain on the diagonal.

3. **General Case**: For any matrix \( A \) with real eigenvalues, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are given by applying the function \( f(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - \lambda \) to each eigenvalue of \( A \). Since \( \lambda \) is real, \( f(\lambda) \) is real. This result holds for any Jordan block structure, confirming that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

4. **Conclusion**: The eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real because they are derived from real eigenvalues of \( A \) through the polynomial \( f(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - \lambda \), which preserves real numbers.

Thus, the statement is true.

Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this matrix problem here. Let me read it again: &quot;Let \( A \in M(n,\mathbb{R}) \) be a matrix with all real eigenvalues. Determine if it is true that all the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are also real.&quot; Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out whether squaring a matrix with real eigenvalues and then subtracting the matrix itself will result in a matrix that still has all real eigenvalues. 

First, let me recall some linear algebra concepts. If a matrix has all real eigenvalues, it&#x27;s called a real diagonalizable matrix, but wait, no, actually, diagonalizable matrices are those that can be written as PDP^{-1} where D is diagonal. But having all real eigenvalues doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the matrix is diagonalizable, right? For example, a Jordan block matrix has eigenvalues on the diagonal but is not diagonalizable if it has ones on the superdiagonal. So, the question doesn&#x27;t state that A is diagonalizable, just that all its eigenvalues are real. So A could be diagonalizable or not, but regardless, it&#x27;s a real matrix with real eigenvalues. 

Now, the problem is about the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \). Let me think. If A is diagonalizable, then it can be diagonalized as \( A = PDP^{-1} \), where D is a diagonal matrix with its eigenvalues on the diagonal. Then \( A^2 - A = PD^2P^{-1} - PDP^{-1} = P(D^2 - D)P^{-1} \). So the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) would be the diagonal entries of \( D^2 - D \), which are just \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) for each eigenvalue \( \lambda \) of A. Since all eigenvalues \( \lambda \) are real, then \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is also real. Therefore, if A is diagonalizable, then all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that A is diagonalizable. So even if A is not diagonalizable, does \( A^2 - A \) still have real eigenvalues? Hmm. Let me consider the case where A is not diagonalizable. For example, take a Jordan block matrix with real eigenvalues. Suppose A is a 2x2 Jordan block with eigenvalue λ. Then A is upper triangular with λ on the diagonal and 1 above the diagonal. Let me compute \( A^2 - A \). 

Let&#x27;s take λ as a real number. The Jordan block J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 &amp; 2\lambda \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 \end{pmatrix} \). So \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 - \lambda &amp; 2\lambda - 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \). 

The eigenvalues of \( J^2 - J \) are just the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), repeated twice. Since λ is real, \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is real. So even if A is a Jordan block, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, what about the off-diagonal entry? If the Jordan block is 2x2, then \( J^2 - J \) is upper triangular with eigenvalues \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), but the off-diagonal entry is \( 2\lambda - 1 \). However, eigenvalues are determined by the characteristic equation, which for a triangular matrix is just the product of (t - a_ii). So even though there&#x27;s an entry above the diagonal, the eigenvalues are still the diagonal entries. Therefore, even in the non-diagonalizable case, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check with a specific example. Suppose λ = 1. Then J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} 1^2 - 1 &amp; 2*1 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 1^2 -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \). The eigenvalues of this matrix are 0 and 0, which are real. 

Another example, take λ = 2. Then J^2 - J would be:

\[ \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 2 &amp; 4 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 4 -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 3 \\ 0 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix} \]. The eigenvalues are both 2, which are real. 

So even in the Jordan block case, the eigenvalues remain real. Therefore, whether A is diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me think again. Suppose we have a general matrix A with real eigenvalues. Then A can be written in Jordan canonical form, which is upper triangular with real eigenvalues on the diagonal and possibly ones on the superdiagonal. Then \( A^2 - A \) would be upper triangular because the product and difference of upper triangular matrices are upper triangular. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), each of which is real because \( \lambda_i \) is real. 

Therefore, regardless of whether A is diagonalizable, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me check with another example. Suppose A is a 3x3 matrix with a more complicated Jordan structure. For example, a Jordan matrix with blocks of different sizes. Let me take a Jordan matrix J with eigenvalues 1, 1, 1, but with a Jordan block of size 2 and another of size 1. Then:

J = diag(J1, J2), where J1 is the 2x2 block and J2 is the 1x1 block. So,

J1 = [[1, 1], [0, 1]], J2 = [1]. Then J is:

[[1, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 is:

[[1^2, 2*1, 0],
 [0, 1^2, 0],
 [0, 0, 1^2]] = [[1, 2, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 - J = [[1 -1, 2 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 1 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 0 -0, 1 -1]] = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]. 

The eigenvalues of this matrix are all 0, which are real. 

Alternatively, if I take a Jordan block with eigenvalue 0. Let&#x27;s say J is a 2x2 Jordan block with 0 on the diagonal. Then J = [[0,1],[0,0]]. Then J^2 is [[0,0],[0,0]], so J^2 - J = -J, which has eigenvalues 0 and 0. Still real. 

Another case: take a diagonal matrix with real eigenvalues. Then obviously, A^2 - A is diagonal with entries \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), which are real. 

So in all these examples, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

Wait, but \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is a real number if \( \lambda \) is real.

Therefore, even if the matrix is not diagonalizable, since in its Jordan form, the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A.

For functions applied to matrices, in the case of Jordan blocks, if you have a Jordan block with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) for a function f analytic (like a polynomial) would be upper triangular with f(λ) on the diagonal and the upper diagonals filled with derivatives or something? Wait, actually, for a Jordan block J with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) is a matrix where each entry is given by the Taylor expansion of f around λ. For example, if J is a Jordan block of size k, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ)/1! on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, etc., up to the (k-1)th superdiagonal. 

But in our case, f(x) = x^2 - x. Let&#x27;s compute f(J) for a Jordan block J. Let&#x27;s take a 2x2 Jordan block again. 

J = [[λ, 1], [0, λ]]

Then f(J) = J^2 - J. As computed earlier, this is:

[[λ^2 - λ, 2λ - 1], [0, λ^2 - λ]]

So the diagonal entries are f(λ) = λ^2 - λ, which is real if λ is real. The superdiagonal entries are f’(λ) * 1 (since derivative of x^2 - x is 2x -1, evaluated at λ, so 2λ -1). 

But regardless, the eigenvalues of f(J) are still the diagonal entries, which are f(λ), so they are real. For higher Jordan blocks, the same logic applies.

Therefore, even in the case of a non-diagonalizable matrix, the eigenvalues of f(A) = A^2 - A are f(λ_i), which are real numbers since λ_i are real. Therefore, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

Therefore, the answer should be yes, it&#x27;s true that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

But p(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real polynomial, so if λ is real, then p(λ) is real. Therefore, regardless of the structure of A, the eigenvalues of p(A) must be real.

Let&#x27;s take λ as a real number. The Jordan block J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 &amp; 2\lambda \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 \end{pmatrix} \). So \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 - \lambda &amp; 2\lambda - 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \). 

The eigenvalues of \( J^2 - J \) are just the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), repeated twice. Since λ is real, \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is real. So even if A is a Jordan block, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

But wait, let me check with another example. Suppose A is a 3x3 matrix with a more complicated Jordan structure. For example, a Jordan matrix with blocks of different sizes. Let me take a Jordan matrix J with eigenvalues 1, 1, 1, but with a Jordan block of size 2 and another of size 1. Then:

J = diag(J1, J2), where J1 is the 2x2 block and J2 is the 1x1 block. So,

J1 = [[1, 1], [0, 1]], J2 = [1]. Then J is:

[[1, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 is:

[[1^2, 2*1, 0],
 [0, 1^2, 0],
 [0, 0, 1^2]] = [[1, 2, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 - J = [[1 -1, 2 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 1 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 0 -0, 1 -1]] = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]. 

The eigenvalues of this matrix are all 0, which are real. 

Alternatively, if I take a Jordan block with eigenvalue 0. Let&#x27;s say J is a 2x2 Jordan block with 0 on the diagonal. Then J = [[0,1],[0,0]]. Then J^2 is [[0,0],[0,0]], so J^2 - J = -J, which has eigenvalues 0 and 0. Still real. 

Another case: take a diagonal matrix with real eigenvalues. Then obviously, A^2 - A is diagonal with entries \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), which are real. 

So in all these examples, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, is there a case where even though the original matrix has real eigenvalues, the polynomial transformation \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) could introduce complex eigenvalues? 

Wait, but \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is a real number if \( \lambda \) is real. So if all eigenvalues of A are real, then applying the function f(x) = x^2 - x to each eigenvalue would result in real numbers. Therefore, even if the matrix is not diagonalizable, since in its Jordan form, the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A. 

Wait, is that true? For functions applied to matrices, in the case of Jordan blocks, if you have a Jordan block with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) for a function f analytic (like a polynomial) would be upper triangular with f(λ) on the diagonal and the upper diagonals filled with derivatives or something? Wait, actually, for a Jordan block J with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) is a matrix where each entry is given by the Taylor expansion of f around λ. For example, if J is a Jordan block of size k, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ)/1! on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, etc., up to the (k-1)th superdiagonal. 

But in our case, f(x) = x^2 - x. Let&#x27;s compute f(J) for a Jordan block J. Let&#x27;s take a 2x2 Jordan block again. 

J = [[λ, 1], [0, λ]]

Then f(J) = J^2 - J. As computed earlier, this is:

[[λ^2 - λ, 2λ - 1], [0, λ^2 - λ]]

So the diagonal entries are f(λ) = λ^2 - λ, which is real if λ is real. The superdiagonal entries are f’(λ) * 1 (since derivative of x^2 - x is 2x -1, evaluated at λ, so 2λ -1). 

But regardless, the eigenvalues of f(J) are still the diagonal entries, which are f(λ), so they are real. For higher Jordan blocks, the same logic applies. If you have a Jordan block of size 3 with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ) on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, but the eigenvalues are still just f(λ) with multiplicity equal to the size of the block. 

Therefore, even in the case of a non-diagonalizable matrix, the eigenvalues of f(A) = A^2 - A are f(λ_i), which are real numbers since λ_i are real. Therefore, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

Therefore, the answer should be yes, it&#x27;s true that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me try to see if there&#x27;s any possible way that even with real eigenvalues of A, the eigenvalues of A^2 - A could become complex. But given that eigenvalues of A are real, then f(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real number for each eigenvalue. Since eigenvalues of A^2 - A are precisely f(λ_i) for each eigenvalue λ_i of A, then they have to be real. 

But wait, is this always the case? For any matrix A with real eigenvalues, even if it&#x27;s not diagonalizable, are the eigenvalues of f(A) just f(λ_i)? 

Yes, because the eigenvalues of f(A) are the same as applying f to each eigenvalue of A, counting algebraic multiplicities. This is a standard result in linear algebra. For any function f that is analytic (and polynomials are certainly analytic), the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A. 

Therefore, regardless of the structure of A (whether diagonalizable or not), if all eigenvalues of A are real, then applying the polynomial f(x) = x^2 - x to each eigenvalue will result in real numbers. Thus, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A must be real. 

Therefore, the statement is true. 

But wait, let me think of another angle. Suppose someone claims that even though eigenvalues are transformed by f, maybe when the matrix is defective (not diagonalizable), the eigenvalues could somehow become complex. But no, because the eigenvalues of a real matrix are either real or come in complex conjugate pairs. However, in this problem, A is given to have all real eigenvalues, so there are no complex eigenvalues to conjugate. Therefore, even if A is defective, the eigenvalues of f(A) are still the f(λ_i), which are real. 

Alternatively, consider the characteristic polynomial of A. If all eigenvalues of A are real, then the characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors over ℝ. Then, perhaps the characteristic polynomial of A^2 - A can be related to that of A. But this might be more complicated. 

Alternatively, using the concept of functional calculus: for any matrix A, if p is a polynomial, then the eigenvalues of p(A) are p(λ) where λ are eigenvalues of A. Therefore, since A has real eigenvalues, p(A) will have eigenvalues p(λ), which are real if p(λ) is real for all real λ. 

But p(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real polynomial, so if λ is real, then p(λ) is real. Therefore, regardless of the structure of A, the eigenvalues of p(A) must be real. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that yes, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

I can&#x27;t find any counterexamples, and all the reasoning points towards the eigenvalues being real. So I think the answer is that it is indeed true.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{True}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a matrix \( A \in M(n,\mathbb{R}) \) with all real eigenvalues, we need to determine if all the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are also real.

1. **Diagonalizable Case**: If \( A \) is diagonalizable, it can be written as \( A = PDP^{-1} \) where \( D \) is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. Then \( A^2 - A = P(D^2 - D)P^{-1} \). The eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) for each eigenvalue \( \lambda \) of \( A \), which are real since \( \lambda \) is real.

2. **Non-Diagonalizable Case**: If \( A \) is not diagonalizable, it can be written in Jordan canonical form. For a Jordan block \( J \) with eigenvalue \( \lambda \), \( J^2 - J \) is upper triangular with diagonal entries \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), which are real. The off-diagonal entries do not affect the eigenvalues, which remain on the diagonal.

3. **General Case**: For any matrix \( A \) with real eigenvalues, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are given by applying the function \( f(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - \lambda \) to each eigenvalue of \( A \). Since \( \lambda \) is real, \( f(\lambda) \) is real. This result holds for any Jordan block structure, confirming that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

4. **Conclusion**: The eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real because they are derived from real eigenvalues of \( A \) through the polynomial \( f(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - \lambda \), which preserves real numbers.

Thus, the statement is true.

Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this matrix problem here. Let me read it again: &quot;Let \( A \in M(n,\mathbb{R}) \) be a matrix with all real eigenvalues. Determine if it is true that all the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are also real.&quot; Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out whether squaring a matrix with real eigenvalues and then subtracting the matrix itself will result in a matrix that still has all real eigenvalues. 

First, let me recall some linear algebra concepts. If a matrix has all real eigenvalues, it&#x27;s called a real diagonalizable matrix, but wait, no, actually, diagonalizable matrices are those that can be written as PDP^{-1} where D is diagonal. But having all real eigenvalues doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the matrix is diagonalizable, right? For example, a Jordan block matrix has eigenvalues on the diagonal but is not diagonalizable if it has ones on the superdiagonal. So, the question doesn&#x27;t state that A is diagonalizable, just that all its eigenvalues are real. So A could be diagonalizable or not, but regardless, it&#x27;s a real matrix with real eigenvalues. 

Now, the problem is about the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \). Let me think. If A is diagonalizable, then it can be diagonalized as \( A = PDP^{-1} \), where D is a diagonal matrix with its eigenvalues on the diagonal. Then \( A^2 - A = PD^2P^{-1} - PDP^{-1} = P(D^2 - D)P^{-1} \). So the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) would be the diagonal entries of \( D^2 - D \), which are just \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) for each eigenvalue \( \lambda \) of A. Since all eigenvalues \( \lambda \) are real, then \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is also real. Therefore, if A is diagonalizable, then all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that A is diagonalizable. So even if A is not diagonalizable, does \( A^2 - A \) still have real eigenvalues? Hmm. Let me consider the case where A is not diagonalizable. For example, take a Jordan block matrix with real eigenvalues. Suppose A is a 2x2 Jordan block with eigenvalue λ. Then A is upper triangular with λ on the diagonal and 1 above the diagonal. Let me compute \( A^2 - A \). 

Let&#x27;s take λ as a real number. The Jordan block J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 &amp; 2\lambda \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 \end{pmatrix} \). So \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 - \lambda &amp; 2\lambda - 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \). 

The eigenvalues of \( J^2 - J \) are just the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), repeated twice. Since λ is real, \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is real. So even if A is a Jordan block, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, what about the off-diagonal entry? If the Jordan block is 2x2, then \( J^2 - J \) is upper triangular with eigenvalues \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), but the off-diagonal entry is \( 2\lambda - 1 \). However, eigenvalues are determined by the characteristic equation, which for a triangular matrix is just the product of (t - a_ii). So even though there&#x27;s an entry above the diagonal, the eigenvalues are still the diagonal entries. Therefore, even in the non-diagonalizable case, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check with a specific example. Suppose λ = 1. Then J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} 1^2 - 1 &amp; 2*1 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 1^2 -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \). The eigenvalues of this matrix are 0 and 0, which are real. 

Another example, take λ = 2. Then J^2 - J would be:

\[ \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 2 &amp; 4 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 4 -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 3 \\ 0 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix} \]. The eigenvalues are both 2, which are real. 

So even in the Jordan block case, the eigenvalues remain real. Therefore, whether A is diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me think again. Suppose we have a general matrix A with real eigenvalues. Then A can be written in Jordan canonical form, which is upper triangular with real eigenvalues on the diagonal and possibly ones on the superdiagonal. Then \( A^2 - A \) would be upper triangular because the product and difference of upper triangular matrices are upper triangular. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), each of which is real because \( \lambda_i \) is real. 

Therefore, regardless of whether A is diagonalizable, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me check with another example. Suppose A is a 3x3 matrix with a more complicated Jordan structure. For example, a Jordan matrix with blocks of different sizes. Let me take a Jordan matrix J with eigenvalues 1, 1, 1, but with a Jordan block of size 2 and another of size 1. Then:

J = diag(J1, J2), where J1 is the 2x2 block and J2 is the 1x1 block. So,

J1 = [[1, 1], [0, 1]], J2 = [1]. Then J is:

[[1, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 is:

[[1^2, 2*1, 0],
 [0, 1^2, 0],
 [0, 0, 1^2]] = [[1, 2, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 - J = [[1 -1, 2 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 1 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 0 -0, 1 -1]] = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]. 

The eigenvalues of this matrix are all 0, which are real. 

Alternatively, if I take a Jordan block with eigenvalue 0. Let&#x27;s say J is a 2x2 Jordan block with 0 on the diagonal. Then J = [[0,1],[0,0]]. Then J^2 is [[0,0],[0,0]], so J^2 - J = -J, which has eigenvalues 0 and 0. Still real. 

Another case: take a diagonal matrix with real eigenvalues. Then obviously, A^2 - A is diagonal with entries \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), which are real. 

So in all these examples, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

But in our case, f(x) = x^2 - x. Let&#x27;s compute f(J) for a Jordan block J. Let&#x27;s take a 2x2 Jordan block again. 

J = [[λ, 1], [0, λ]]

Then f(J) = J^2 - J. As computed earlier, this is:

[[λ^2 - λ, 2λ - 1], [0, λ^2 - λ]]

So the diagonal entries are f(λ) = λ^2 - λ, which is real if λ is real. The superdiagonal entries are f’(λ) * 1 (since derivative of x^2 - x is 2x -1, evaluated at λ, so 2λ -1).

Then A is upper triangular with λ on the diagonal and 1 above the diagonal. Let me compute \( A^2 - A \). 

Let&#x27;s take λ as a real number. The Jordan block J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 &amp; 2\lambda \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 \end{pmatrix} \). So \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 - \lambda &amp; 2\lambda - 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \). 

The eigenvalues of \( J^2 - J \) are just the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), repeated twice. Since λ is real, \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is real. So even if A is a Jordan block, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

So even in the Jordan block case, the eigenvalues remain real. Therefore, whether A is diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me think again. Suppose we have a general matrix A with real eigenvalues. Then A can be written in Jordan canonical form, which is upper triangular with real eigenvalues on the diagonal and possibly ones on the superdiagonal. Then \( A^2 - A \) would be upper triangular because the product and difference of upper triangular matrices are upper triangular. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), each of which is real because \( \lambda_i \) is real. 

Therefore, regardless of whether A is diagonalizable, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me check with another example. Suppose A is a 3x3 matrix with a more complicated Jordan structure. For example, a Jordan matrix with blocks of different sizes. Let me take a Jordan matrix J with eigenvalues 1, 1, 1, but with a Jordan block of size 2 and another of size 1. Then:

J = diag(J1, J2), where J1 is the 2x2 block and J2 is the 1x1 block. So,

J1 = [[1, 1], [0, 1]], J2 = [1]. Then J is:

[[1, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 is:

[[1^2, 2*1, 0],
 [0, 1^2, 0],
 [0, 0, 1^2]] = [[1, 2, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 - J = [[1 -1, 2 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 1 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 0 -0, 1 -1]] = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]. 

The eigenvalues of this matrix are all 0, which are real. 

Alternatively, if I take a Jordan block with eigenvalue 0. Let&#x27;s say J is a 2x2 Jordan block with 0 on the diagonal. Then J = [[0,1],[0,0]]. Then J^2 is [[0,0],[0,0]], so J^2 - J = -J, which has eigenvalues 0 and 0. Still real. 

Another case: take a diagonal matrix with real eigenvalues. Then obviously, A^2 - A is diagonal with entries \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), which are real. 

So in all these examples, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, is there a case where even though the original matrix has real eigenvalues, the polynomial transformation \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) could introduce complex eigenvalues? 

Wait, but \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is a real number if \( \lambda \) is real. So if all eigenvalues of A are real, then applying the function f(x) = x^2 - x to each eigenvalue would result in real numbers. Therefore, even if the matrix is not diagonalizable, since in its Jordan form, the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A. 

Wait, is that true? For functions applied to matrices, in the case of Jordan blocks, if you have a Jordan block with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) for a function f analytic (like a polynomial) would be upper triangular with f(λ) on the diagonal and the upper diagonals filled with derivatives or something? Wait, actually, for a Jordan block J with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) is a matrix where each entry is given by the Taylor expansion of f around λ. For example, if J is a Jordan block of size k, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ)/1! on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, etc., up to the (k-1)th superdiagonal. 

But in our case, f(x) = x^2 - x. Let&#x27;s compute f(J) for a Jordan block J. Let&#x27;s take a 2x2 Jordan block again. 

J = [[λ, 1], [0, λ]]

Then f(J) = J^2 - J. As computed earlier, this is:

[[λ^2 - λ, 2λ - 1], [0, λ^2 - λ]]

So the diagonal entries are f(λ) = λ^2 - λ, which is real if λ is real. The superdiagonal entries are f’(λ) * 1 (since derivative of x^2 - x is 2x -1, evaluated at λ, so 2λ -1). 

But regardless, the eigenvalues of f(J) are still the diagonal entries, which are f(λ), so they are real. For higher Jordan blocks, the same logic applies. If you have a Jordan block of size 3 with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ) on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, but the eigenvalues are still just f(λ) with multiplicity equal to the size of the block. 

Therefore, even in the case of a non-diagonalizable matrix, the eigenvalues of f(A) = A^2 - A are f(λ_i), which are real numbers since λ_i are real. Therefore, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

Therefore, the answer should be yes, it&#x27;s true that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me try to see if there&#x27;s any possible way that even with real eigenvalues of A, the eigenvalues of A^2 - A could become complex. But given that eigenvalues of A are real, then f(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real number for each eigenvalue. Since eigenvalues of A^2 - A are precisely f(λ_i) for each eigenvalue λ_i of A, then they have to be real. 

But wait, is this always the case? For any matrix A with real eigenvalues, even if it&#x27;s not diagonalizable, are the eigenvalues of f(A) just f(λ_i)? 

Yes, because the eigenvalues of f(A) are the same as applying f to each eigenvalue of A, counting algebraic multiplicities. This is a standard result in linear algebra. For any function f that is analytic (and polynomials are certainly analytic), the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A. 

Therefore, regardless of the structure of A (whether diagonalizable or not), if all eigenvalues of A are real, then applying the polynomial f(x) = x^2 - x to each eigenvalue will result in real numbers. Thus, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A must be real. 

Therefore, the statement is true. 

But wait, let me think of another angle. Suppose someone claims that even though eigenvalues are transformed by f, maybe when the matrix is defective (not diagonalizable), the eigenvalues could somehow become complex. But no, because the eigenvalues of a real matrix are either real or come in complex conjugate pairs. However, in this problem, A is given to have all real eigenvalues, so there are no complex eigenvalues to conjugate. Therefore, even if A is defective, the eigenvalues of f(A) are still the f(λ_i), which are real. 

Alternatively, consider the characteristic polynomial of A. If all eigenvalues of A are real, then the characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors over ℝ. Then, perhaps the characteristic polynomial of A^2 - A can be related to that of A. But this might be more complicated. 

Alternatively, using the concept of functional calculus: for any matrix A, if p is a polynomial, then the eigenvalues of p(A) are p(λ) where λ are eigenvalues of A. Therefore, since A has real eigenvalues, p(A) will have eigenvalues p(λ), which are real if p(λ) is real for all real λ. 

But p(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real polynomial, so if λ is real, then p(λ) is real. Therefore, regardless of the structure of A, the eigenvalues of p(A) must be real. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that yes, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

I can&#x27;t find any counterexamples, and all the reasoning points towards the eigenvalues being real. So I think the answer is that it is indeed true.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{True}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a matrix \( A \in M(n,\mathbb{R}) \) with all real eigenvalues, we need to determine if all the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are also real.

1. **Diagonalizable Case**: If \( A \) is diagonalizable, it can be written as \( A = PDP^{-1} \) where \( D \) is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. Then \( A^2 - A = P(D^2 - D)P^{-1} \). The eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) for each eigenvalue \( \lambda \) of \( A \), which are real since \( \lambda \) is real.

2. **Non-Diagonalizable Case**: If \( A \) is not diagonalizable, it can be written in Jordan canonical form. For a Jordan block \( J \) with eigenvalue \( \lambda \), \( J^2 - J \) is upper triangular with diagonal entries \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), which are real. The off-diagonal entries do not affect the eigenvalues, which remain on the diagonal.

3. **General Case**: For any matrix \( A \) with real eigenvalues, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are given by applying the function \( f(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - \lambda \) to each eigenvalue of \( A \). Since \( \lambda \) is real, \( f(\lambda) \) is real. This result holds for any Jordan block structure, confirming that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

4. **Conclusion**: The eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real because they are derived from real eigenvalues of \( A \) through the polynomial \( f(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - \lambda \), which preserves real numbers.

Thus, the statement is true.

Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this matrix problem here. Let me read it again: &quot;Let \( A \in M(n,\mathbb{R}) \) be a matrix with all real eigenvalues. Determine if it is true that all the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are also real.&quot; Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out whether squaring a matrix with real eigenvalues and then subtracting the matrix itself will result in a matrix that still has all real eigenvalues. 

First, let me recall some linear algebra concepts. If a matrix has all real eigenvalues, it&#x27;s called a real diagonalizable matrix, but wait, no, actually, diagonalizable matrices are those that can be written as PDP^{-1} where D is diagonal. But having all real eigenvalues doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the matrix is diagonalizable, right? For example, a Jordan block matrix has eigenvalues on the diagonal but is not diagonalizable if it has ones on the superdiagonal. So, the question doesn&#x27;t state that A is diagonalizable, just that all its eigenvalues are real. So A could be diagonalizable or not, but regardless, it&#x27;s a real matrix with real eigenvalues. 

Now, the problem is about the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \). Let me think. If A is diagonalizable, then it can be diagonalized as \( A = PDP^{-1} \), where D is a diagonal matrix with its eigenvalues on the diagonal. Then \( A^2 - A = PD^2P^{-1} - PDP^{-1} = P(D^2 - D)P^{-1} \). So the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) would be the diagonal entries of \( D^2 - D \), which are just \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) for each eigenvalue \( \lambda \) of A. Since all eigenvalues \( \lambda \) are real, then \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is also real. Therefore, if A is diagonalizable, then all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that A is diagonalizable. So even if A is not diagonalizable, does \( A^2 - A \) still have real eigenvalues? Hmm. Let me consider the case where A is not diagonalizable. For example, take a Jordan block matrix with real eigenvalues. Suppose A is a 2x2 Jordan block with eigenvalue λ. Then A is upper triangular with λ on the diagonal and 1 above the diagonal. Let me compute \( A^2 - A \). 

Let&#x27;s take λ as a real number. The Jordan block J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 &amp; 2\lambda \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 \end{pmatrix} \). So \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 - \lambda &amp; 2\lambda - 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \). 

The eigenvalues of \( J^2 - J \) are just the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), repeated twice. Since λ is real, \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is real. So even if A is a Jordan block, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, what about the off-diagonal entry? If the Jordan block is 2x2, then \( J^2 - J \) is upper triangular with eigenvalues \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), but the off-diagonal entry is \( 2\lambda - 1 \). However, eigenvalues are determined by the characteristic equation, which for a triangular matrix is just the product of (t - a_ii). So even though there&#x27;s an entry above the diagonal, the eigenvalues are still the diagonal entries. Therefore, even in the non-diagonalizable case, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check with a specific example. Suppose λ = 1. Then J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} 1^2 - 1 &amp; 2*1 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 1^2 -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \). The eigenvalues of this matrix are 0 and 0, which are real. 

Another example, take λ = 2. Then J^2 - J would be:

\[ \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 2 &amp; 4 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 4 -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 3 \\ 0 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix} \]. The eigenvalues are both 2, which are real. 

So even in the Jordan block case, the eigenvalues remain real. Therefore, whether A is diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me think again. Suppose we have a general matrix A with real eigenvalues. Then A can be written in Jordan canonical form, which is upper triangular with real eigenvalues on the diagonal and possibly ones on the superdiagonal. Then \( A^2 - A \) would be upper triangular because the product and difference of upper triangular matrices are upper triangular. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), each of which is real because \( \lambda_i \) is real. 

Therefore, regardless of whether A is diagonalizable, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me check with another example. Suppose A is a 3x3 matrix with a more complicated Jordan structure. For example, a Jordan matrix with blocks of different sizes. Let me take a Jordan matrix J with eigenvalues 1, 1, 1, but with a Jordan block of size 2 and another of size 1. Then:

J = diag(J1, J2), where J1 is the 2x2 block and J2 is the 1x1 block. So,

J1 = [[1, 1], [0, 1]], J2 = [1]. Then J is:

[[1, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 is:

[[1^2, 2*1, 0],
 [0, 1^2, 0],
 [0, 0, 1^2]] = [[1, 2, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 - J = [[1 -1, 2 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 1 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 0 -0, 1 -1]] = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]. 

The eigenvalues of this matrix are all 0, which are real. 

Alternatively, if I take a Jordan block with eigenvalue 0. Let&#x27;s say J is a 2x2 Jordan block with 0 on the diagonal. Then J = [[0,1],[0,0]]. Then J^2 is [[0,0],[0,0]], so J^2 - J = -J, which has eigenvalues 0 and 0. Still real. 

Another case: take a diagonal matrix with real eigenvalues. Then obviously, A^2 - A is diagonal with entries \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), which are real. 

So in all these examples, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

But in our case, f(x) = x^2 - x. Let&#x27;s compute f(J) for a Jordan block J. Let&#x27;s take a 2x2 Jordan block again. 

J = [[λ, 1], [0, λ]]

Then f(J) = J^2 - J. As computed earlier, this is:

[[λ^2 - λ, 2λ - 1], [0, λ^2 - λ]]

So the diagonal entries are f(λ) = λ^2 - λ, which is real if λ is real. The superdiagonal entries are f’(λ) * 1 (since derivative of x^2 - x is 2x -1, evaluated at λ, so 2λ -1).

Therefore, even in the case of a non-diagonalizable matrix, the eigenvalues of f(A) = A^2 - A are f(λ_i), which are real numbers since λ_i are real. Therefore, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

Therefore, the answer should be yes, it&#x27;s true that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

Let&#x27;s take λ as a real number. The Jordan block J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 &amp; 2\lambda \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 \end{pmatrix} \). So \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 - \lambda &amp; 2\lambda - 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \). 

The eigenvalues of \( J^2 - J \) are just the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), repeated twice. Since λ is real, \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is real. So even if A is a Jordan block, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

\[ \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 2 &amp; 4 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 4 -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 3 \\ 0 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix} \]. The eigenvalues are both 2, which are real. 

So even in the Jordan block case, the eigenvalues remain real. Therefore, whether A is diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me think again. Suppose we have a general matrix A with real eigenvalues. Then A can be written in Jordan canonical form, which is upper triangular with real eigenvalues on the diagonal and possibly ones on the superdiagonal. Then \( A^2 - A \) would be upper triangular because the product and difference of upper triangular matrices are upper triangular. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), each of which is real because \( \lambda_i \) is real. 

Therefore, regardless of whether A is diagonalizable, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me check with another example. Suppose A is a 3x3 matrix with a more complicated Jordan structure. For example, a Jordan matrix with blocks of different sizes. Let me take a Jordan matrix J with eigenvalues 1, 1, 1, but with a Jordan block of size 2 and another of size 1. Then:

J = diag(J1, J2), where J1 is the 2x2 block and J2 is the 1x1 block. So,

J1 = [[1, 1], [0, 1]], J2 = [1]. Then J is:

[[1, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 is:

[[1^2, 2*1, 0],
 [0, 1^2, 0],
 [0, 0, 1^2]] = [[1, 2, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 - J = [[1 -1, 2 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 1 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 0 -0, 1 -1]] = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]. 

The eigenvalues of this matrix are all 0, which are real. 

Alternatively, if I take a Jordan block with eigenvalue 0. Let&#x27;s say J is a 2x2 Jordan block with 0 on the diagonal. Then J = [[0,1],[0,0]]. Then J^2 is [[0,0],[0,0]], so J^2 - J = -J, which has eigenvalues 0 and 0. Still real. 

Another case: take a diagonal matrix with real eigenvalues. Then obviously, A^2 - A is diagonal with entries \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), which are real. 

So in all these examples, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, is there a case where even though the original matrix has real eigenvalues, the polynomial transformation \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) could introduce complex eigenvalues? 

Wait, but \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is a real number if \( \lambda \) is real. So if all eigenvalues of A are real, then applying the function f(x) = x^2 - x to each eigenvalue would result in real numbers. Therefore, even if the matrix is not diagonalizable, since in its Jordan form, the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A. 

Wait, is that true? For functions applied to matrices, in the case of Jordan blocks, if you have a Jordan block with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) for a function f analytic (like a polynomial) would be upper triangular with f(λ) on the diagonal and the upper diagonals filled with derivatives or something? Wait, actually, for a Jordan block J with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) is a matrix where each entry is given by the Taylor expansion of f around λ. For example, if J is a Jordan block of size k, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ)/1! on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, etc., up to the (k-1)th superdiagonal. 

But in our case, f(x) = x^2 - x. Let&#x27;s compute f(J) for a Jordan block J. Let&#x27;s take a 2x2 Jordan block again. 

J = [[λ, 1], [0, λ]]

Then f(J) = J^2 - J. As computed earlier, this is:

[[λ^2 - λ, 2λ - 1], [0, λ^2 - λ]]

So the diagonal entries are f(λ) = λ^2 - λ, which is real if λ is real. The superdiagonal entries are f’(λ) * 1 (since derivative of x^2 - x is 2x -1, evaluated at λ, so 2λ -1). 

But regardless, the eigenvalues of f(J) are still the diagonal entries, which are f(λ), so they are real. For higher Jordan blocks, the same logic applies. If you have a Jordan block of size 3 with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ) on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, but the eigenvalues are still just f(λ) with multiplicity equal to the size of the block. 

Therefore, even in the case of a non-diagonalizable matrix, the eigenvalues of f(A) = A^2 - A are f(λ_i), which are real numbers since λ_i are real. Therefore, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

Therefore, the answer should be yes, it&#x27;s true that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me try to see if there&#x27;s any possible way that even with real eigenvalues of A, the eigenvalues of A^2 - A could become complex. But given that eigenvalues of A are real, then f(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real number for each eigenvalue. Since eigenvalues of A^2 - A are precisely f(λ_i) for each eigenvalue λ_i of A, then they have to be real. 

But wait, is this always the case? For any matrix A with real eigenvalues, even if it&#x27;s not diagonalizable, are the eigenvalues of f(A) just f(λ_i)? 

Yes, because the eigenvalues of f(A) are the same as applying f to each eigenvalue of A, counting algebraic multiplicities. This is a standard result in linear algebra. For any function f that is analytic (and polynomials are certainly analytic), the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A. 

Therefore, regardless of the structure of A (whether diagonalizable or not), if all eigenvalues of A are real, then applying the polynomial f(x) = x^2 - x to each eigenvalue will result in real numbers. Thus, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A must be real. 

Therefore, the statement is true. 

But wait, let me think of another angle. Suppose someone claims that even though eigenvalues are transformed by f, maybe when the matrix is defective (not diagonalizable), the eigenvalues could somehow become complex. But no, because the eigenvalues of a real matrix are either real or come in complex conjugate pairs. However, in this problem, A is given to have all real eigenvalues, so there are no complex eigenvalues to conjugate. Therefore, even if A is defective, the eigenvalues of f(A) are still the f(λ_i), which are real. 

Alternatively, consider the characteristic polynomial of A. If all eigenvalues of A are real, then the characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors over ℝ. Then, perhaps the characteristic polynomial of A^2 - A can be related to that of A. But this might be more complicated. 

Alternatively, using the concept of functional calculus: for any matrix A, if p is a polynomial, then the eigenvalues of p(A) are p(λ) where λ are eigenvalues of A. Therefore, since A has real eigenvalues, p(A) will have eigenvalues p(λ), which are real if p(λ) is real for all real λ. 

But p(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real polynomial, so if λ is real, then p(λ) is real. Therefore, regardless of the structure of A, the eigenvalues of p(A) must be real. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that yes, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

I can&#x27;t find any counterexamples, and all the reasoning points towards the eigenvalues being real. So I think the answer is that it is indeed true.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{True}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a matrix \( A \in M(n,\mathbb{R}) \) with all real eigenvalues, we need to determine if all the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are also real.

1. **Diagonalizable Case**: If \( A \) is diagonalizable, it can be written as \( A = PDP^{-1} \) where \( D \) is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. Then \( A^2 - A = P(D^2 - D)P^{-1} \). The eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) for each eigenvalue \( \lambda \) of \( A \), which are real since \( \lambda \) is real.

2. **Non-Diagonalizable Case**: If \( A \) is not diagonalizable, it can be written in Jordan canonical form. For a Jordan block \( J \) with eigenvalue \( \lambda \), \( J^2 - J \) is upper triangular with diagonal entries \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), which are real. The off-diagonal entries do not affect the eigenvalues, which remain on the diagonal.

3. **General Case**: For any matrix \( A \) with real eigenvalues, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are given by applying the function \( f(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - \lambda \) to each eigenvalue of \( A \). Since \( \lambda \) is real, \( f(\lambda) \) is real. This result holds for any Jordan block structure, confirming that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

4. **Conclusion**: The eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real because they are derived from real eigenvalues of \( A \) through the polynomial \( f(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - \lambda \), which preserves real numbers.

Thus, the statement is true.

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Alright, so I have this matrix problem here. Let me read it again: &quot;Let \( A \in M(n,\mathbb{R}) \) be a matrix with all real eigenvalues. Determine if it is true that all the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are also real.&quot; Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out whether squaring a matrix with real eigenvalues and then subtracting the matrix itself will result in a matrix that still has all real eigenvalues. 

First, let me recall some linear algebra concepts. If a matrix has all real eigenvalues, it&#x27;s called a real diagonalizable matrix, but wait, no, actually, diagonalizable matrices are those that can be written as PDP^{-1} where D is diagonal. But having all real eigenvalues doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the matrix is diagonalizable, right? For example, a Jordan block matrix has eigenvalues on the diagonal but is not diagonalizable if it has ones on the superdiagonal. So, the question doesn&#x27;t state that A is diagonalizable, just that all its eigenvalues are real. So A could be diagonalizable or not, but regardless, it&#x27;s a real matrix with real eigenvalues. 

Now, the problem is about the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \). Let me think. If A is diagonalizable, then it can be diagonalized as \( A = PDP^{-1} \), where D is a diagonal matrix with its eigenvalues on the diagonal. Then \( A^2 - A = PD^2P^{-1} - PDP^{-1} = P(D^2 - D)P^{-1} \). So the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) would be the diagonal entries of \( D^2 - D \), which are just \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) for each eigenvalue \( \lambda \) of A. Since all eigenvalues \( \lambda \) are real, then \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is also real. Therefore, if A is diagonalizable, then all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, the problem doesn&#x27;t specify that A is diagonalizable. So even if A is not diagonalizable, does \( A^2 - A \) still have real eigenvalues? Hmm. Let me consider the case where A is not diagonalizable. For example, take a Jordan block matrix with real eigenvalues. Suppose A is a 2x2 Jordan block with eigenvalue λ. Then A is upper triangular with λ on the diagonal and 1 above the diagonal. Let me compute \( A^2 - A \). 

Let&#x27;s take λ as a real number. The Jordan block J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 &amp; 2\lambda \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 \end{pmatrix} \). So \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^2 - \lambda &amp; 2\lambda - 1 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda^2 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \). 

The eigenvalues of \( J^2 - J \) are just the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), repeated twice. Since λ is real, \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is real. So even if A is a Jordan block, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, what about the off-diagonal entry? If the Jordan block is 2x2, then \( J^2 - J \) is upper triangular with eigenvalues \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \), but the off-diagonal entry is \( 2\lambda - 1 \). However, eigenvalues are determined by the characteristic equation, which for a triangular matrix is just the product of (t - a_ii). So even though there&#x27;s an entry above the diagonal, the eigenvalues are still the diagonal entries. Therefore, even in the non-diagonalizable case, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check with a specific example. Suppose λ = 1. Then J is:

\[ J = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} \]

Then \( J^2 - J = \begin{pmatrix} 1^2 - 1 &amp; 2*1 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 1^2 -1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \). The eigenvalues of this matrix are 0 and 0, which are real. 

Another example, take λ = 2. Then J^2 - J would be:

\[ \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 2 &amp; 4 -1 \\ 0 &amp; 4 -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 3 \\ 0 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix} \]. The eigenvalues are both 2, which are real. 

So even in the Jordan block case, the eigenvalues remain real. Therefore, whether A is diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me think again. Suppose we have a general matrix A with real eigenvalues. Then A can be written in Jordan canonical form, which is upper triangular with real eigenvalues on the diagonal and possibly ones on the superdiagonal. Then \( A^2 - A \) would be upper triangular because the product and difference of upper triangular matrices are upper triangular. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are the diagonal entries, which are \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), each of which is real because \( \lambda_i \) is real. 

Therefore, regardless of whether A is diagonalizable, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, let me check with another example. Suppose A is a 3x3 matrix with a more complicated Jordan structure. For example, a Jordan matrix with blocks of different sizes. Let me take a Jordan matrix J with eigenvalues 1, 1, 1, but with a Jordan block of size 2 and another of size 1. Then:

J = diag(J1, J2), where J1 is the 2x2 block and J2 is the 1x1 block. So,

J1 = [[1, 1], [0, 1]], J2 = [1]. Then J is:

[[1, 1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 is:

[[1^2, 2*1, 0],
 [0, 1^2, 0],
 [0, 0, 1^2]] = [[1, 2, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]

Then J^2 - J = [[1 -1, 2 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 1 -1, 0 -0], [0 -0, 0 -0, 1 -1]] = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]. 

The eigenvalues of this matrix are all 0, which are real. 

Alternatively, if I take a Jordan block with eigenvalue 0. Let&#x27;s say J is a 2x2 Jordan block with 0 on the diagonal. Then J = [[0,1],[0,0]]. Then J^2 is [[0,0],[0,0]], so J^2 - J = -J, which has eigenvalues 0 and 0. Still real. 

Another case: take a diagonal matrix with real eigenvalues. Then obviously, A^2 - A is diagonal with entries \( \lambda_i^2 - \lambda_i \), which are real. 

So in all these examples, whether diagonalizable or not, the eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real. 

But wait, is there a case where even though the original matrix has real eigenvalues, the polynomial transformation \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) could introduce complex eigenvalues? 

Wait, but \( \lambda^2 - \lambda \) is a real number if \( \lambda \) is real. So if all eigenvalues of A are real, then applying the function f(x) = x^2 - x to each eigenvalue would result in real numbers. Therefore, even if the matrix is not diagonalizable, since in its Jordan form, the eigenvalues of f(A) are f(λ_i), where λ_i are the eigenvalues of A. 

Wait, is that true? For functions applied to matrices, in the case of Jordan blocks, if you have a Jordan block with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) for a function f analytic (like a polynomial) would be upper triangular with f(λ) on the diagonal and the upper diagonals filled with derivatives or something? Wait, actually, for a Jordan block J with eigenvalue λ, then f(J) is a matrix where each entry is given by the Taylor expansion of f around λ. For example, if J is a Jordan block of size k, then f(J) will have f(λ) on the diagonal, f’(λ)/1! on the first superdiagonal, f’’(λ)/2! on the second superdiagonal, etc., up to the (k-1)th superdiagonal. 

But in our case, f(x) = x^2 - x. Let&#x27;s compute f(J) for a Jordan block J. Let&#x27;s take a 2x2 Jordan block again. 

J = [[λ, 1], [0, λ]]

Then f(J) = J^2 - J. As computed earlier, this is:

[[λ^2 - λ, 2λ - 1], [0, λ^2 - λ]]

So the diagonal entries are f(λ) = λ^2 - λ, which is real if λ is real. The superdiagonal entries are f’(λ) * 1 (since derivative of x^2 - x is 2x -1, evaluated at λ, so 2λ -1). 

But regardless, the eigenvalues of f(J) are still the diagonal entries, which are f(λ), so they are real. For higher Jordan blocks, the same logic applies.

Therefore, even in the case of a non-diagonalizable matrix, the eigenvalues of f(A) = A^2 - A are f(λ_i), which are real numbers since λ_i are real. Therefore, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real. 

Therefore, the answer should be yes, it&#x27;s true that all eigenvalues of \( A^2 - A \) are real.

But p(λ) = λ^2 - λ is a real polynomial, so if λ is real, then p(λ) is real. Therefore, regardless of the structure of A, the eigenvalues of p(A) must be real. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that yes, all eigenvalues of A^2 - A are real.

Response: \boxed{4 \dfrac{1}{3}}.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\lfloor x \rfloor + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\dfrac{1}{3}$. We write $x$ as $n+\dfrac{1}{3}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Therefore, we can write $\lfloor x \rfloor + x$ as $n+n+\dfrac{1}{3}=\dfrac{13}{3}$. Solving, we get $n=2$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $2+\dfrac{1}{3}=\boxed{\dfrac{7}{3}}$.          </p>

Problem: Find $x$ such that $\lfloor x \rfloor + x = \dfrac{13}{3}$. Express $x$ as a common fraction. Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>

Response: \boxed{4 \frac{1}{3}} \boxed{4 \frac{1}{3}}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\lfloor x \rfloor + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\dfrac{1}{3}$. We write $x$ as $n+\dfrac{1}{3}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Therefore, we can write $\lfloor x \rfloor + x$ as $n+n+\dfrac{1}{3}=\dfrac{13}{3}$. Solving, we get $n=2$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $2+\dfrac{1}{3}=\boxed{\dfrac{7}{3}}$.          </p>
