Problem: Suppose the function $f(x)$ is defined on the domain $\{x_1,x_2,x_3\}$, so that the graph of $y=f(x)$ consists of just three points. Suppose those three points form a triangle of area $32$.

The graph of $y = 2f(2x)$ also consists of just three points. What is the area of the triangle formed by those three points? Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>

Reference Answer: The original graph consists of the points $(x_1,f(x_1)),$ $(x_2,f(x_2)),$ and $(x_3,f(x_3))$.

The graph of $y=2f(2x)$ consists of the points $\left(\frac{x_1}2,2f(x_1)\right),$ $\left(\frac{x_2}2,2f(x_2)\right),$ and $\left(\frac{x_3}2,2f(x_3)\right)$. Relative to the original graph, it is stretched vertically by a factor of $2$, but also compressed horizontally by the same factor. The vertical transformation doubles the area of the triangle formed by the three points, but the horizontal transformation halves it again, so the final area is equal to the original $\boxed{32}$.          </p>

Relative to the original graph, it is stretched vertically by a factor of $2$, but also compressed horizontally by the same factor. The vertical transformation doubles the area of the triangle formed by the three points, but the horizontal transformation halves it again, so the final area is equal to the original $\boxed{32}$.          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this question: In a compact topological space X, is every compact subset K necessarily closed? Hmm, interesting. Let me try to work through this step by step. Maybe I should start by recalling some basic definitions and properties related to compact spaces and closed sets.

First, a compact space is a topological space in which every open cover has a finite subcover. That means if I have any collection of open sets that cover the entire space X, I can always find a finite number of these open sets that still cover X. Now, the question is about subsets K of X that are compact. So, even if X itself is compact, does that force every compact subset K of X to be closed?

I remember that in Hausdorff spaces, all compact subsets are closed. But the question here doesn&#x27;t specify that X is Hausdorff. So maybe the answer depends on whether X is Hausdorff or not? Wait, but the question just says a compact topological space. It doesn’t mention Hausdorff. So maybe there&#x27;s a counterexample where a compact subset isn&#x27;t closed in a compact space that isn&#x27;t Hausdorff.

Let me think. Let&#x27;s recall that in a compact Hausdorff space, subsets are compact if and only if they are closed. So if the space is both compact and Hausdorff, then yes, compact subsets are closed. But if the space is compact but not Hausdorff, maybe this doesn&#x27;t hold?

I need to remember some examples of compact non-Hausdorff spaces. For example, the Sierpiński space. Let me recall. The Sierpiński space has two points, say {0, 1}, with the topology where the open sets are ∅, {1}, and {0, 1}. Is this space compact? Yes, because it&#x27;s finite. So every finite space is compact. Now, in the Sierpiński space, is every compact subset closed?

Well, let&#x27;s see. The subsets of the Sierpiński space are: ∅, {0}, {1}, and {0,1}. The closed sets are the complements of the open sets. The open sets are ∅, {1}, and {0,1}, so the closed sets are ∅, {0}, and {0,1}. Now, which subsets are compact? In any topological space, finite sets are compact. So all subsets of the Sierpiński space are finite, hence compact. But not all subsets are closed. For example, the subset {1} is open but not closed (since its complement {0} is closed). Wait, but {1} is compact because it&#x27;s finite, but it&#x27;s not closed. So in the Sierpiński space, which is compact, there exists a compact subset ({1}) that is not closed. Therefore, the answer is no: in a compact topological space, not every compact subset is necessarily closed.

But wait, let me confirm if the Sierpiński space is indeed compact. Since it&#x27;s finite, it&#x27;s compact, right? Because any open cover must have a finite subcover. Yes, because there are only finitely many open sets. So in this case, the Sierpiński space serves as a counterexample where the space is compact, but not all compact subsets are closed.

Alternatively, another example might be a finite space with a non-Hausdorff topology. Suppose we take a two-point space where the only open sets are the empty set and the whole space. Then, is this compact? Yes, because it&#x27;s finite. In this case, every subset is compact (since they&#x27;re finite), but the only closed sets are the empty set and the whole space. So any singleton set would be compact but not closed. So that&#x27;s another example.

Therefore, in general, in compact spaces that are not Hausdorff, we can have compact subsets that are not closed. Thus, the answer is no, not necessarily.

But let me check another perspective. Maybe there&#x27;s a theorem that says something about this. In general topology, I know that closed subsets of compact spaces are compact. Is the converse true? If a subset is compact in a compact space, is it closed? Well, in Hausdorff spaces yes, because compact subsets of Hausdorff spaces are closed, and Hausdorffness is a sufficient condition for that. But without Hausdorffness, that might fail, as in the examples above.

Wait, actually, in the Sierpiński space, the whole space is compact, and {1} is a compact subset that isn&#x27;t closed. So that&#x27;s a valid counterexample.

Alternatively, suppose we have a compact space that is not T1. A space is T1 if all singletons are closed. So if a space is not T1, there exists a singleton that is not closed. Since singletons are always compact (they&#x27;re finite), in such a space, you have compact subsets (the singletons) that are not closed. Therefore, in compact non-T1 spaces, there are compact subsets that aren&#x27;t closed.

So, in conclusion, the answer depends on the separation axioms. If the compact space is also Hausdorff (or at least T1), then compact subsets are closed. But without such separation axioms, compactness of the whole space doesn&#x27;t ensure that all compact subsets are closed.

Therefore, the answer is no: in a compact topological space X, not every compact subset K is necessarily closed. The key is whether the space is Hausdorff or not. Since the question doesn&#x27;t assume Hausdorffness, we can&#x27;t conclude that all compact subsets are closed.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}

In a compact topological space \( X \), not every compact subset \( K \) is necessarily closed. The key reason is that the space might not be Hausdorff. 

1. **Definitions and Properties**:
   - A compact space is one where every open cover has a finite subcover.
   - In Hausdorff spaces, all compact subsets are closed. However, the question does not assume \( X \) is Hausdorff.

2. **Counterexamples**:
   - **Sierpiński Space**: This space has two points \(\{0, 1\}\) with the topology \(\{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{0, 1\}\}\). It is compact (being finite) but not Hausdorff. The subset \(\{1\}\) is compact (finite) but not closed (its complement \(\{0\}\) is closed).
   - **Non-T1 Spaces**: In a compact space that is not T1, there exist singletons (which are compact) that are not closed.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - In compact non-Hausdorff spaces, compact subsets need not be closed. The Sierpiński space serves as a valid counterexample where a compact subset is not closed.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{No}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this question: In a compact topological space X, is every compact subset K necessarily closed? Hmm, interesting. Let me try to work through this step by step. Maybe I should start by recalling some basic definitions and properties related to compact spaces and closed sets.

First, a compact space is a topological space in which every open cover has a finite subcover. That means if I have any collection of open sets that cover the entire space X, I can always find a finite number of these open sets that still cover X. Now, the question is about subsets K of X that are compact. So, even if X itself is compact, does that force every compact subset K of X to be closed?

Wait, but the question just says a compact topological space. It doesn’t mention Hausdorff.

So any singleton set would be compact but not closed. So that&#x27;s another example.

Therefore, in general, in compact spaces that are not Hausdorff, we can have compact subsets that are not closed. Thus, the answer is no, not necessarily.

But let me check another perspective. Maybe there&#x27;s a theorem that says something about this. In general topology, I know that closed subsets of compact spaces are compact. Is the converse true? If a subset is compact in a compact space, is it closed? Well, in Hausdorff spaces yes, because compact subsets of Hausdorff spaces are closed, and Hausdorffness is a sufficient condition for that. But without Hausdorffness, that might fail, as in the examples above.

Wait, actually, in the Sierpiński space, the whole space is compact, and {1} is a compact subset that isn&#x27;t closed. So that&#x27;s a valid counterexample.

Alternatively, suppose we have a compact space that is not T1. A space is T1 if all singletons are closed. So if a space is not T1, there exists a singleton that is not closed. Since singletons are always compact (they&#x27;re finite), in such a space, you have compact subsets (the singletons) that are not closed. Therefore, in compact non-T1 spaces, there are compact subsets that aren&#x27;t closed.

So, in conclusion, the answer depends on the separation axioms. If the compact space is also Hausdorff (or at least T1), then compact subsets are closed. But without such separation axioms, compactness of the whole space doesn&#x27;t ensure that all compact subsets are closed.

Therefore, the answer is no: in a compact topological space X, not every compact subset K is necessarily closed. The key is whether the space is Hausdorff or not. Since the question doesn&#x27;t assume Hausdorffness, we can&#x27;t conclude that all compact subsets are closed.

**Final Answer**

In a compact topological space \( X \), not every compact subset \( K \) is necessarily closed. The key reason is that the space might not be Hausdorff. 

1. **Definitions and Properties**:
   - A compact space is one where every open cover has a finite subcover.
   - In Hausdorff spaces, all compact subsets are closed. However, the question does not assume \( X \) is Hausdorff.

2. **Counterexamples**:
   - **Sierpiński Space**: This space has two points \(\{0, 1\}\) with the topology \(\{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{0, 1\}\}\). It is compact (being finite) but not Hausdorff. The subset \(\{1\}\) is compact (finite) but not closed (its complement \(\{0\}\) is closed).
   - **Non-T1 Spaces**: In a compact space that is not T1, there exist singletons (which are compact) that are not closed.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - In compact non-Hausdorff spaces, compact subsets need not be closed. The Sierpiński space serves as a valid counterexample where a compact subset is not closed.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this question: In a compact topological space X, is every compact subset K necessarily closed? Hmm, interesting. Let me try to work through this step by step. Maybe I should start by recalling some basic definitions and properties related to compact spaces and closed sets.

First, a compact space is a topological space in which every open cover has a finite subcover. That means if I have any collection of open sets that cover the entire space X, I can always find a finite number of these open sets that still cover X. Now, the question is about subsets K of X that are compact. So, even if X itself is compact, does that force every compact subset K of X to be closed?

I remember that in Hausdorff spaces, all compact subsets are closed. But the question here doesn&#x27;t specify that X is Hausdorff. So maybe the answer depends on whether X is Hausdorff or not? Wait, but the question just says a compact topological space. It doesn’t mention Hausdorff. So maybe there&#x27;s a counterexample where a compact subset isn&#x27;t closed in a compact space that isn&#x27;t Hausdorff.

Let me think. Let&#x27;s recall that in a compact Hausdorff space, subsets are compact if and only if they are closed. So if the space is both compact and Hausdorff, then yes, compact subsets are closed. But if the space is compact but not Hausdorff, maybe this doesn&#x27;t hold?

I need to remember some examples of compact non-Hausdorff spaces. For example, the Sierpiński space. Let me recall. The Sierpiński space has two points, say {0, 1}, with the topology where the open sets are ∅, {1}, and {0, 1}. Is this space compact? Yes, because it&#x27;s finite. So every finite space is compact. Now, in the Sierpiński space, is every compact subset closed?

Well, let&#x27;s see. The subsets of the Sierpiński space are: ∅, {0}, {1}, and {0,1}. The closed sets are the complements of the open sets. The open sets are ∅, {1}, and {0,1}, so the closed sets are ∅, {0}, and {0,1}. Now, which subsets are compact? In any topological space, finite sets are compact. So all subsets of the Sierpiński space are finite, hence compact. But not all subsets are closed. For example, the subset {1} is open but not closed (since its complement {0} is closed). Wait, but {1} is compact because it&#x27;s finite, but it&#x27;s not closed. So in the Sierpiński space, which is compact, there exists a compact subset ({1}) that is not closed. Therefore, the answer is no: in a compact topological space, not every compact subset is necessarily closed.

But wait, let me confirm if the Sierpiński space is indeed compact. Since it&#x27;s finite, it&#x27;s compact, right? Because any open cover must have a finite subcover. Yes, because there are only finitely many open sets. So in this case, the Sierpiński space serves as a counterexample where the space is compact, but not all compact subsets are closed.

Alternatively, another example might be a finite space with a non-Hausdorff topology. Suppose we take a two-point space where the only open sets are the empty set and the whole space. Then, is this compact? Yes, because it&#x27;s finite. In this case, every subset is compact (since they&#x27;re finite), but the only closed sets are the empty set and the whole space.

Therefore, the answer is no: in a compact topological space X, not every compact subset K is necessarily closed. The key is whether the space is Hausdorff or not. Since the question doesn&#x27;t assume Hausdorffness, we can&#x27;t conclude that all compact subsets are closed.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

In a compact topological space \( X \), not every compact subset \( K \) is necessarily closed. The key reason is that the space might not be Hausdorff. 

1. **Definitions and Properties**:
   - A compact space is one where every open cover has a finite subcover.
   - In Hausdorff spaces, all compact subsets are closed. However, the question does not assume \( X \) is Hausdorff.

2. **Counterexamples**:
   - **Sierpiński Space**: This space has two points \(\{0, 1\}\) with the topology \(\{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{0, 1\}\}\). It is compact (being finite) but not Hausdorff. The subset \(\{1\}\) is compact (finite) but not closed (its complement \(\{0\}\) is closed).
   - **Non-T1 Spaces**: In a compact space that is not T1, there exist singletons (which are compact) that are not closed.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - In compact non-Hausdorff spaces, compact subsets need not be closed. The Sierpiński space serves as a valid counterexample where a compact subset is not closed.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{No}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this question: In a compact topological space X, is every compact subset K necessarily closed? Hmm, interesting. Let me try to work through this step by step. Maybe I should start by recalling some basic definitions and properties related to compact spaces and closed sets.

First, a compact space is a topological space in which every open cover has a finite subcover. That means if I have any collection of open sets that cover the entire space X, I can always find a finite number of these open sets that still cover X. Now, the question is about subsets K of X that are compact. So, even if X itself is compact, does that force every compact subset K of X to be closed?

I remember that in Hausdorff spaces, all compact subsets are closed. But the question here doesn&#x27;t specify that X is Hausdorff. So maybe the answer depends on whether X is Hausdorff or not? Wait, but the question just says a compact topological space. It doesn’t mention Hausdorff. So maybe there&#x27;s a counterexample where a compact subset isn&#x27;t closed in a compact space that isn&#x27;t Hausdorff.

Let me think. Let&#x27;s recall that in a compact Hausdorff space, subsets are compact if and only if they are closed. So if the space is both compact and Hausdorff, then yes, compact subsets are closed. But if the space is compact but not Hausdorff, maybe this doesn&#x27;t hold?

I need to remember some examples of compact non-Hausdorff spaces. For example, the Sierpiński space. Let me recall. The Sierpiński space has two points, say {0, 1}, with the topology where the open sets are ∅, {1}, and {0, 1}. Is this space compact? Yes, because it&#x27;s finite. So every finite space is compact. Now, in the Sierpiński space, is every compact subset closed?

Well, let&#x27;s see. The subsets of the Sierpiński space are: ∅, {0}, {1}, and {0,1}. The closed sets are the complements of the open sets. The open sets are ∅, {1}, and {0,1}, so the closed sets are ∅, {0}, and {0,1}. Now, which subsets are compact? In any topological space, finite sets are compact. So all subsets of the Sierpiński space are finite, hence compact. But not all subsets are closed. For example, the subset {1} is open but not closed (since its complement {0} is closed). Wait, but {1} is compact because it&#x27;s finite, but it&#x27;s not closed. So in the Sierpiński space, which is compact, there exists a compact subset ({1}) that is not closed. Therefore, the answer is no: in a compact topological space, not every compact subset is necessarily closed.

But wait, let me confirm if the Sierpiński space is indeed compact. Since it&#x27;s finite, it&#x27;s compact, right? Because any open cover must have a finite subcover. Yes, because there are only finitely many open sets. So in this case, the Sierpiński space serves as a counterexample where the space is compact, but not all compact subsets are closed.

Alternatively, another example might be a finite space with a non-Hausdorff topology. Suppose we take a two-point space where the only open sets are the empty set and the whole space. Then, is this compact? Yes, because it&#x27;s finite. In this case, every subset is compact (since they&#x27;re finite), but the only closed sets are the empty set and the whole space. So any singleton set would be compact but not closed. So that&#x27;s another example.

Therefore, in general, in compact spaces that are not Hausdorff, we can have compact subsets that are not closed. Thus, the answer is no, not necessarily.

But let me check another perspective. Maybe there&#x27;s a theorem that says something about this. In general topology, I know that closed subsets of compact spaces are compact. Is the converse true? If a subset is compact in a compact space, is it closed? Well, in Hausdorff spaces yes, because compact subsets of Hausdorff spaces are closed, and Hausdorffness is a sufficient condition for that. But without Hausdorffness, that might fail, as in the examples above.

Wait, actually, in the Sierpiński space, the whole space is compact, and {1} is a compact subset that isn&#x27;t closed. So that&#x27;s a valid counterexample.

Alternatively, suppose we have a compact space that is not T1. A space is T1 if all singletons are closed. So if a space is not T1, there exists a singleton that is not closed. Since singletons are always compact (they&#x27;re finite), in such a space, you have compact subsets (the singletons) that are not closed. Therefore, in compact non-T1 spaces, there are compact subsets that aren&#x27;t closed.

So, in conclusion, the answer depends on the separation axioms. If the compact space is also Hausdorff (or at least T1), then compact subsets are closed. But without such separation axioms, compactness of the whole space doesn&#x27;t ensure that all compact subsets are closed.

Therefore, the answer is no: in a compact topological space X, not every compact subset K is necessarily closed. The key is whether the space is Hausdorff or not. Since the question doesn&#x27;t assume Hausdorffness, we can&#x27;t conclude that all compact subsets are closed.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this question: In a compact topological space X, is every compact subset K necessarily closed? Hmm, interesting. Let me try to work through this step by step. Maybe I should start by recalling some basic definitions and properties related to compact spaces and closed sets.

First, a compact space is a topological space in which every open cover has a finite subcover. That means if I have any collection of open sets that cover the entire space X, I can always find a finite number of these open sets that still cover X. Now, the question is about subsets K of X that are compact. So, even if X itself is compact, does that force every compact subset K of X to be closed?

I remember that in Hausdorff spaces, all compact subsets are closed. But the question here doesn&#x27;t specify that X is Hausdorff. So maybe the answer depends on whether X is Hausdorff or not? Wait, but the question just says a compact topological space. It doesn’t mention Hausdorff. So maybe there&#x27;s a counterexample where a compact subset isn&#x27;t closed in a compact space that isn&#x27;t Hausdorff.

Let me think. Let&#x27;s recall that in a compact Hausdorff space, subsets are compact if and only if they are closed. So if the space is both compact and Hausdorff, then yes, compact subsets are closed. But if the space is compact but not Hausdorff, maybe this doesn&#x27;t hold?

I need to remember some examples of compact non-Hausdorff spaces. For example, the Sierpiński space. Let me recall. The Sierpiński space has two points, say {0, 1}, with the topology where the open sets are ∅, {1}, and {0, 1}. Is this space compact? Yes, because it&#x27;s finite. So every finite space is compact. Now, in the Sierpiński space, is every compact subset closed?

Well, let&#x27;s see. The subsets of the Sierpiński space are: ∅, {0}, {1}, and {0,1}. The closed sets are the complements of the open sets. The open sets are ∅, {1}, and {0,1}, so the closed sets are ∅, {0}, and {0,1}. Now, which subsets are compact? In any topological space, finite sets are compact. So all subsets of the Sierpiński space are finite, hence compact. But not all subsets are closed. For example, the subset {1} is open but not closed (since its complement {0} is closed). Wait, but {1} is compact because it&#x27;s finite, but it&#x27;s not closed. So in the Sierpiński space, which is compact, there exists a compact subset ({1}) that is not closed. Therefore, the answer is no: in a compact topological space, not every compact subset is necessarily closed.

But wait, let me confirm if the Sierpiński space is indeed compact. Since it&#x27;s finite, it&#x27;s compact, right? Because any open cover must have a finite subcover. Yes, because there are only finitely many open sets. So in this case, the Sierpiński space serves as a counterexample where the space is compact, but not all compact subsets are closed.

Alternatively, another example might be a finite space with a non-Hausdorff topology. Suppose we take a two-point space where the only open sets are the empty set and the whole space. Then, is this compact? Yes, because it&#x27;s finite. In this case, every subset is compact (since they&#x27;re finite), but the only closed sets are the empty set and the whole space. So any singleton set would be compact but not closed. So that&#x27;s another example.

Therefore, in general, in compact spaces that are not Hausdorff, we can have compact subsets that are not closed. Thus, the answer is no, not necessarily.

But let me check another perspective. Maybe there&#x27;s a theorem that says something about this. In general topology, I know that closed subsets of compact spaces are compact. Is the converse true? If a subset is compact in a compact space, is it closed? Well, in Hausdorff spaces yes, because compact subsets of Hausdorff spaces are closed, and Hausdorffness is a sufficient condition for that. But without Hausdorffness, that might fail, as in the examples above.

Wait, actually, in the Sierpiński space, the whole space is compact, and {1} is a compact subset that isn&#x27;t closed. So that&#x27;s a valid counterexample.

Alternatively, suppose we have a compact space that is not T1. A space is T1 if all singletons are closed. So if a space is not T1, there exists a singleton that is not closed. Since singletons are always compact (they&#x27;re finite), in such a space, you have compact subsets (the singletons) that are not closed. Therefore, in compact non-T1 spaces, there are compact subsets that aren&#x27;t closed.

So, in conclusion, the answer depends on the separation axioms. If the compact space is also Hausdorff (or at least T1), then compact subsets are closed. But without such separation axioms, compactness of the whole space doesn&#x27;t ensure that all compact subsets are closed.

Therefore, the answer is no: in a compact topological space X, not every compact subset K is necessarily closed. The key is whether the space is Hausdorff or not. Since the question doesn&#x27;t assume Hausdorffness, we can&#x27;t conclude that all compact subsets are closed.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

In a compact topological space \( X \), not every compact subset \( K \) is necessarily closed. The key reason is that the space might not be Hausdorff. 

1. **Definitions and Properties**:
   - A compact space is one where every open cover has a finite subcover.
   - In Hausdorff spaces, all compact subsets are closed. However, the question does not assume \( X \) is Hausdorff.

2. **Counterexamples**:
   - **Sierpiński Space**: This space has two points \(\{0, 1\}\) with the topology \(\{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{0, 1\}\}\). It is compact (being finite) but not Hausdorff. The subset \(\{1\}\) is compact (finite) but not closed (its complement \(\{0\}\) is closed).
   - **Non-T1 Spaces**: In a compact space that is not T1, there exist singletons (which are compact) that are not closed.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - In compact non-Hausdorff spaces, compact subsets need not be closed. The Sierpiński space serves as a valid counterexample where a compact subset is not closed.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{No}\).          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Response: \( \boxed{9} \)          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \). The function is defined as \( f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right) \) for \( x \neq 0 \), and \( f(0) = 9k \). For continuity at \( x = 0 \), the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 should equal \( f(0) \), so I need to compute \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) \) and set it equal to \( 9k \), then solve for \( k \).

First, let me recall that the greatest integer function \( \lfloor y \rfloor \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( y \). So, for each term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) where \( n \) ranges from 1 to 8, as \( x \) approaches 0, \( \frac{n}{x } \) becomes very large. Therefore, each floor function term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately equal to \( \frac{n}{x} \) minus some fractional part. But since we&#x27;re multiplying by \( x \), perhaps those fractional parts become negligible when multiplied by \( x \), especially in the limit as \( x \to 0 \).

Let me test this idea. Let&#x27;s consider a single term first: \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). If \( x \) is approaching 0, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is approaching infinity. The floor of \( \frac{n}{x} \) is \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying this by \( x \), we get \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} = n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \).

Now, as \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) should approach 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is between 0 and 1, so multiplying by \( x \) gives something between 0 and \( x \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the limit of \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \) is \( n \). 

If this is the case for each term from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), then the entire sum inside the function \( f(x) \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \), and multiplying by \( x \) gives \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left( n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) \). Therefore, the limit as \( x \to 0 \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36 \). Hence, \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = 36 \), so setting \( 9k = 36 \), we get \( k = 4 \).

But wait, is this too straightforward? Let me check again. The problem is that even though each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \), maybe there&#x27;s a cumulative effect when summing all these terms. However, since each term individually tends to \( n \), and there are finitely many terms (8 terms), the sum should approach the sum of the limits, which is 36. Therefore, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36, so \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But let me try to verify this more carefully. Let&#x27;s take a specific example. Let&#x27;s pick \( x = 1/m \) where \( m \) is a positive integer going to infinity (since \( x \to 0 \) corresponds to \( m \to \infty \)). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n m \), which is an integer, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n m \). Therefore, multiplying by \( x = 1/m \), we get exactly \( n \). So in this case, \( f(1/m) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Therefore, along this sequence \( x = 1/m \), the limit is indeed 36.

However, what if \( x \) approaches 0 in a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer? Let&#x27;s suppose \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), where \( 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n(m + \theta) \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor n m + n \theta \rfloor = n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \). Then, multiplying by \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), we get:

\( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} = \frac{n m}{m + \theta} + \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \).

As \( m \to \infty \), the first term \( \frac{n m}{m + \theta} \approx n \cdot \frac{m}{m} = n \), and the second term \( \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \approx 0 \), since \( \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \) is bounded by \( n \theta &lt; n \). Therefore, even in this case, the limit as \( m \to \infty \) (i.e., \( x \to 0 \)) is \( n \). Therefore, regardless of how \( x \) approaches 0, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \), so the sum approaches 36. Thus, \( k = 4 \).

But let&#x27;s do a concrete numerical example. Suppose \( x = 0.0001 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = 10000 \), so \( \lfloor 1/x \rfloor = 10000 \), \( \lfloor 2/x \rfloor = 20000 \), up to \( \lfloor 8/x \rfloor = 80000 \). Then, the sum is \( 10000 + 20000 + \cdots + 80000 = 10000(1 + 2 + \cdots + 8) = 10000 \cdot 36 = 360000 \). Multiplying by \( x = 0.0001 \) gives \( 360000 \cdot 0.0001 = 36 \). So indeed, for such a small \( x \), \( f(x) = 36 \), which is exactly the value we need for continuity. Therefore, \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

Wait, but perhaps there&#x27;s a subtlety here. Suppose instead of taking \( x = 1/m \), we take \( x \) approaching 0 in such a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer. Let&#x27;s take \( x = \epsilon \), a very small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is some large number, say \( N + \delta \), where \( N = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = x N \). But \( \frac{n}{x} = N + \delta \implies x = \frac{n}{N + \delta} \). Therefore, \( x N = \frac{n N}{N + \delta} = n \cdot \frac{N}{N + \delta} \). As \( x \to 0 \), \( N \to \infty \), so \( \frac{N}{N + \delta} \to 1 \). Therefore, \( x N \to n \). Hence, even in this case, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Therefore, regardless of the path \( x \to 0 \), each term in the sum converges to \( n \), and since there are finitely many terms, the entire expression converges to 36. Therefore, \( k = 4 \).

But I want to be absolutely thorough here. Let me consider another approach. The function \( f(x) \) can be written as \( x \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). Let&#x27;s substitute \( t = \frac{1}{x} \), so as \( x \to 0^+ \), \( t \to +\infty \). Then, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \). So, the limit becomes \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \).

Now, for each \( n \), \( \lfloor n t \rfloor = n t - \{ n t \} \), where \( 0 \leq \{ n t \} &lt; 1 \). Therefore, \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \frac{1}{t} \left( \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \right ) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n - \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \).

As \( t \to \infty \), the term \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) goes to 0 because each \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, so the sum is bounded between 0 and 8, and dividing by \( t \) (which is going to infinity) gives 0. Therefore, the limit is \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Hence, again, the same conclusion: \( k = 4 \).

Alternatively, one might wonder if there&#x27;s a more complex behavior due to the interaction between different terms. For example, if the fractional parts \( \{ n t \} \) are not independent, maybe their sum fluctuates in a way that doesn&#x27;t vanish when divided by \( t \). However, since each term \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, the entire sum \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 8. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and \( \frac{8}{t} \), which clearly approaches 0 as \( t \to \infty \). Hence, the limit is indeed 36.

Just to be thorough, let&#x27;s consider the left-hand limit as \( x \to 0^- \). But since \( x \) approaches 0 from the left, \( x \) is negative. However, the original function is defined for \( x \neq 0 \), but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, and the floor function of a negative number can behave differently. Wait, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether \( x \) is approaching 0 from the right or left. However, continuity at 0 requires that the limit exists and is equal from both sides. But since \( x = 0 \) is approached from both sides, we need to check both.

Wait, but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to a negative number. For example, if \( \frac{n}{x} = -1.2 \), then \( \lfloor -1.2 \rfloor = -2 \). However, in that case, multiplying \( x \) (which is negative) by \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) (which is also negative) gives a positive product. But in the original problem, when \( x \) is positive (approaching 0 from the right), each term is positive. However, when approaching from the left, \( x \) is negative, and \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is negative, so their product is positive as well. Therefore, perhaps the function \( f(x) \) is positive in both cases.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. For \( x \to 0^- \), \( x \) is negative. Let me compute \( f(x) = x \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \). Since \( x \) is negative, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative. The floor of a negative number is more negative. For example, \( \lfloor -1.5 \rfloor = -2 \). So, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \leq \frac{n}{x} \), but since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, the floor function makes it even more negative. Then, multiplying by \( x \), which is also negative, gives a positive product. Let&#x27;s take an example. Suppose \( x = -0.1 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = -10 \), \( \lfloor -10 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} = -20 \), \( \lfloor -20 \rfloor = -20 \), and so on. So, each term \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n}{x} \) since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer here. Therefore, multiplying by \( x \), we have \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} = n \). Therefore, even for negative \( x \), if \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer, then \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n \), just like in the positive case. Therefore, the sum would again be \( 36 \).

But if \( x \) is negative and \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer, for example, \( x = -0.1 + \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon \) is a small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is slightly less negative than \( -10n \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = -10n - 1 \). Wait, let&#x27;s compute it. Let me take \( x = -0.11 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} \approx -18.1818 \), so \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \). Wait, but here, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is actually one less than the integer part if we look at the magnitude. For example, \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \), since -10 is the greatest integer less than or equal to -9.0909. Similarly, \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \).

Therefore, for \( x = -0.11 \), the term \( x \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \rfloor = (-0.11)(-10) = 1.1 \), but \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so the floor is -10, multiplied by x gives 1.1. However, the actual value of \( \frac{1}{x} \) is approximately -9.0909, so if we take the floor and multiply by x, we get a value slightly larger than 1. Wait, but when x is negative, is this value approaching the same limit?

Wait, let&#x27;s generalize. Let me consider \( x \to 0^- \). Let \( x = -t \), where \( t \to 0^+ \). Then, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \). Now, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \) is equal to \( -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), where \( \lceil y \rceil \) is the ceiling function. Alternatively, for any real number \( y \), \( \lfloor -y \rfloor = -\lceil y \rceil \). Therefore, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor = -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \).

Therefore, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \). Now, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{n}{t} \). Let \( \frac{n}{t} = m + \delta \), where \( m \) is a non-negative integer and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = m + 1 \) if \( \delta &gt; 0 \), otherwise \( m \) if \( \delta = 0 \). Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is not an integer, otherwise \( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \).

Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 - \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \), where \( \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \) is 1 if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer, 0 otherwise. However, for \( t \) approaching 0, the likelihood that \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer becomes negligible unless \( t \) is chosen specifically. So, generically, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \), except on a set of measure zero.

Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 ( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 ) \), except possibly when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer. Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0^+ \), the term \( 8 t \to 0 \). The first term \( t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) is similar to the original problem but approaching from the positive side. As established before, each \( t \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \to n \), so the sum approaches 36. Therefore, \( f(x) = 36 + 0 = 36 \).

However, this seems contradictory because when approaching from the negative side, we have an extra term \( 8t \), but in the limit as \( t \to 0 \), that term disappears. Therefore, both left and right limits are 36. Therefore, the function is continuous at 0 if \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But wait, when approaching from the negative side, we had \( f(x) = t \sum \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), and \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) (except when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer). Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum (\lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1) \). But \( \sum_{n=1}^8 1 = 8 \), so \( f(x) = t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0 \), \( t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) approaches 36 and \( 8 t \to 0 \). Therefore, the left-hand limit is also 36. Thus, the two-sided limit is 36, and therefore, \( k = 4 \).

Therefore, after carefully considering both right and left limits, as well as different ways \( x \) can approach 0, I conclude that the limit is indeed 36, so \( k = 4 \).

**Final Answer**
The value of \( k \) is \boxed{4}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \), we need to compute the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 and set it equal to \( f(0) = 9k \).

The function \( f(x) \) for \( x \neq 0 \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right)
\]

We analyze each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \). For each \( n \), as \( x \to 0 \), \( \frac{n}{x} \) becomes very large. The floor function \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying by \( x \) gives:
\[
x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor = x \left( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) = n - x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\}
\]

As \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) approaches 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is bounded between 0 and 1. Therefore, each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Summing these terms from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), we get:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^8 x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \to \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36
\]

Thus, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36. For continuity at \( x = 0 \), we set \( 9k = 36 \), leading to \( k = 4 \).

Verification for both left and right limits confirms that the limit is indeed 36, regardless of the direction from which \( x \) approaches 0. Therefore, the value of \( k \) is \(\boxed{4}\).          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \). The function is defined as \( f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right) \) for \( x \neq 0 \), and \( f(0) = 9k \). For continuity at \( x = 0 \), the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 should equal \( f(0) \), so I need to compute \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) \) and set it equal to \( 9k \), then solve for \( k \).

First, let me recall that the greatest integer function \( \lfloor y \rfloor \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( y \). So, for each term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) where \( n \) ranges from 1 to 8, as \( x \) approaches 0, \( \frac{n}{x } \) becomes very large. Therefore, each floor function term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately equal to \( \frac{n}{x} \) minus some fractional part. But since we&#x27;re multiplying by \( x \), perhaps those fractional parts become negligible when multiplied by \( x \), especially in the limit as \( x \to 0 \).

Let me test this idea. Let&#x27;s consider a single term first: \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). If \( x \) is approaching 0, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is approaching infinity. The floor of \( \frac{n}{x} \) is \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying this by \( x \), we get \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} = n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \).

Now, as \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) should approach 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is between 0 and 1, so multiplying by \( x \) gives something between 0 and \( x \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the limit of \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \) is \( n \). 

If this is the case for each term from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), then the entire sum inside the function \( f(x) \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \), and multiplying by \( x \) gives \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left( n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) \). Therefore, the limit as \( x \to 0 \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36 \). Hence, \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = 36 \), so setting \( 9k = 36 \), we get \( k = 4 \).

But wait, is this too straightforward? Let me check again. The problem is that even though each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \), maybe there&#x27;s a cumulative effect when summing all these terms. However, since each term individually tends to \( n \), and there are finitely many terms (8 terms), the sum should approach the sum of the limits, which is 36. Therefore, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36, so \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But let me try to verify this more carefully. Let&#x27;s take a specific example. Let&#x27;s pick \( x = 1/m \) where \( m \) is a positive integer going to infinity (since \( x \to 0 \) corresponds to \( m \to \infty \)). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n m \), which is an integer, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n m \). Therefore, multiplying by \( x = 1/m \), we get exactly \( n \). So in this case, \( f(1/m) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Therefore, along this sequence \( x = 1/m \), the limit is indeed 36.

However, what if \( x \) approaches 0 in a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer? Let&#x27;s suppose \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), where \( 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n(m + \theta) \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor n m + n \theta \rfloor = n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \). Then, multiplying by \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), we get:

\( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} = \frac{n m}{m + \theta} + \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \).

As \( m \to \infty \), the first term \( \frac{n m}{m + \theta} \approx n \cdot \frac{m}{m} = n \), and the second term \( \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \approx 0 \), since \( \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \) is bounded by \( n \theta &lt; n \). Therefore, even in this case, the limit as \( m \to \infty \) (i.e., \( x \to 0 \)) is \( n \). Therefore, regardless of how \( x \) approaches 0, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \), so the sum approaches 36. Thus, \( k = 4 \).

But let&#x27;s do a concrete numerical example. Suppose \( x = 0.0001 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = 10000 \), so \( \lfloor 1/x \rfloor = 10000 \), \( \lfloor 2/x \rfloor = 20000 \), up to \( \lfloor 8/x \rfloor = 80000 \). Then, the sum is \( 10000 + 20000 + \cdots + 80000 = 10000(1 + 2 + \cdots + 8) = 10000 \cdot 36 = 360000 \). Multiplying by \( x = 0.0001 \) gives \( 360000 \cdot 0.0001 = 36 \). So indeed, for such a small \( x \), \( f(x) = 36 \), which is exactly the value we need for continuity. Therefore, \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

Wait, but perhaps there&#x27;s a subtlety here. Suppose instead of taking \( x = 1/m \), we take \( x \) approaching 0 in such a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer. Let&#x27;s take \( x = \epsilon \), a very small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is some large number, say \( N + \delta \), where \( N = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = x N \). But \( \frac{n}{x} = N + \delta \implies x = \frac{n}{N + \delta} \). Therefore, \( x N = \frac{n N}{N + \delta} = n \cdot \frac{N}{N + \delta} \). As \( x \to 0 \), \( N \to \infty \), so \( \frac{N}{N + \delta} \to 1 \). Therefore, \( x N \to n \). Hence, even in this case, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Therefore, regardless of the path \( x \to 0 \), each term in the sum converges to \( n \), and since there are finitely many terms, the entire expression converges to 36. Therefore, \( k = 4 \).

But I want to be absolutely thorough here. Let me consider another approach. The function \( f(x) \) can be written as \( x \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). Let&#x27;s substitute \( t = \frac{1}{x} \), so as \( x \to 0^+ \), \( t \to +\infty \). Then, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \). So, the limit becomes \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \).

Now, for each \( n \), \( \lfloor n t \rfloor = n t - \{ n t \} \), where \( 0 \leq \{ n t \} &lt; 1 \). Therefore, \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \frac{1}{t} \left( \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \right ) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n - \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \).

As \( t \to \infty \), the term \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) goes to 0 because each \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, so the sum is bounded between 0 and 8, and dividing by \( t \) (which is going to infinity) gives 0. Therefore, the limit is \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Hence, again, the same conclusion: \( k = 4 \).

Alternatively, one might wonder if there&#x27;s a more complex behavior due to the interaction between different terms. For example, if the fractional parts \( \{ n t \} \) are not independent, maybe their sum fluctuates in a way that doesn&#x27;t vanish when divided by \( t \). However, since each term \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, the entire sum \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 8. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and \( \frac{8}{t} \), which clearly approaches 0 as \( t \to \infty \). Hence, the limit is indeed 36.

Just to be thorough, let&#x27;s consider the left-hand limit as \( x \to 0^- \). But since \( x \) approaches 0 from the left, \( x \) is negative. However, the original function is defined for \( x \neq 0 \), but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, and the floor function of a negative number can behave differently. Wait, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether \( x \) is approaching 0 from the right or left. However, continuity at 0 requires that the limit exists and is equal from both sides. But since \( x = 0 \) is approached from both sides, we need to check both.

Wait, but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to a negative number. For example, if \( \frac{n}{x} = -1.2 \), then \( \lfloor -1.2 \rfloor = -2 \). However, in that case, multiplying \( x \) (which is negative) by \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) (which is also negative) gives a positive product. But in the original problem, when \( x \) is positive (approaching 0 from the right), each term is positive. However, when approaching from the left, \( x \) is negative, and \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is negative, so their product is positive as well. Therefore, perhaps the function \( f(x) \) is positive in both cases.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. For \( x \to 0^- \), \( x \) is negative. Let me compute \( f(x) = x \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \). Since \( x \) is negative, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative. The floor of a negative number is more negative. For example, \( \lfloor -1.5 \rfloor = -2 \). So, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \leq \frac{n}{x} \), but since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, the floor function makes it even more negative. Then, multiplying by \( x \), which is also negative, gives a positive product. Let&#x27;s take an example. Suppose \( x = -0.1 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = -10 \), \( \lfloor -10 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} = -20 \), \( \lfloor -20 \rfloor = -20 \), and so on. So, each term \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n}{x} \) since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer here. Therefore, multiplying by \( x \), we have \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} = n \). Therefore, even for negative \( x \), if \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer, then \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n \), just like in the positive case. Therefore, the sum would again be \( 36 \).

But if \( x \) is negative and \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer, for example, \( x = -0.1 + \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon \) is a small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is slightly less negative than \( -10n \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = -10n - 1 \). Wait, let&#x27;s compute it. Let me take \( x = -0.11 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} \approx -18.1818 \), so \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \). Wait, but here, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is actually one less than the integer part if we look at the magnitude. For example, \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \), since -10 is the greatest integer less than or equal to -9.0909. Similarly, \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \).

Therefore, for \( x = -0.11 \), the term \( x \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \rfloor = (-0.11)(-10) = 1.1 \), but \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so the floor is -10, multiplied by x gives 1.1. However, the actual value of \( \frac{1}{x} \) is approximately -9.0909, so if we take the floor and multiply by x, we get a value slightly larger than 1. Wait, but when x is negative, is this value approaching the same limit?

Wait, let&#x27;s generalize. Let me consider \( x \to 0^- \). Let \( x = -t \), where \( t \to 0^+ \). Then, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \). Now, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \) is equal to \( -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), where \( \lceil y \rceil \) is the ceiling function. Alternatively, for any real number \( y \), \( \lfloor -y \rfloor = -\lceil y \rceil \). Therefore, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor = -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \).

Therefore, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \). Now, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{n}{t} \). Let \( \frac{n}{t} = m + \delta \), where \( m \) is a non-negative integer and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = m + 1 \) if \( \delta &gt; 0 \), otherwise \( m \) if \( \delta = 0 \). Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is not an integer, otherwise \( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \).

Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 - \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \), where \( \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \) is 1 if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer, 0 otherwise. However, for \( t \) approaching 0, the likelihood that \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer becomes negligible unless \( t \) is chosen specifically. So, generically, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \), except on a set of measure zero.

Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 ( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 ) \), except possibly when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer. Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0^+ \), the term \( 8 t \to 0 \). The first term \( t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) is similar to the original problem but approaching from the positive side. As established before, each \( t \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \to n \), so the sum approaches 36. Therefore, \( f(x) = 36 + 0 = 36 \).

However, this seems contradictory because when approaching from the negative side, we have an extra term \( 8t \), but in the limit as \( t \to 0 \), that term disappears. Therefore, both left and right limits are 36. Therefore, the function is continuous at 0 if \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But wait, when approaching from the negative side, we had \( f(x) = t \sum \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), and \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) (except when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer). Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum (\lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1) \). But \( \sum_{n=1}^8 1 = 8 \), so \( f(x) = t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0 \), \( t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) approaches 36 and \( 8 t \to 0 \). Therefore, the left-hand limit is also 36. Thus, the two-sided limit is 36, and therefore, \( k = 4 \).

Therefore, after carefully considering both right and left limits, as well as different ways \( x \) can approach 0, I conclude that the limit is indeed 36, so \( k = 4 \).

**Final Answer**
The value of \( k \) is \boxed{4}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \), we need to compute the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 and set it equal to \( f(0) = 9k \).

The function \( f(x) \) for \( x \neq 0 \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right)
\]

We analyze each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \). For each \( n \), as \( x \to 0 \), \( \frac{n}{x} \) becomes very large. The floor function \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying by \( x \) gives:
\[
x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor = x \left( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) = n - x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\}
\]

As \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) approaches 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is bounded between 0 and 1. Therefore, each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Summing these terms from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), we get:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^8 x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \to \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36
\]

Thus, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36. For continuity at \( x = 0 \), we set \( 9k = 36 \), leading to \( k = 4 \).

Verification for both left and right limits confirms that the limit is indeed 36, regardless of the direction from which \( x \) approaches 0. Therefore, the value of \( k \) is \(\boxed{4}\).          </p>

Response: \( 9 \) \boxed{9}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \). The function is defined as \( f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right) \) for \( x \neq 0 \), and \( f(0) = 9k \). For continuity at \( x = 0 \), the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 should equal \( f(0) \), so I need to compute \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) \) and set it equal to \( 9k \), then solve for \( k \).

First, let me recall that the greatest integer function \( \lfloor y \rfloor \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( y \). So, for each term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) where \( n \) ranges from 1 to 8, as \( x \) approaches 0, \( \frac{n}{x } \) becomes very large. Therefore, each floor function term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately equal to \( \frac{n}{x} \) minus some fractional part. But since we&#x27;re multiplying by \( x \), perhaps those fractional parts become negligible when multiplied by \( x \), especially in the limit as \( x \to 0 \).

Let me test this idea. Let&#x27;s consider a single term first: \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). If \( x \) is approaching 0, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is approaching infinity. The floor of \( \frac{n}{x} \) is \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying this by \( x \), we get \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} = n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \).

Now, as \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) should approach 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is between 0 and 1, so multiplying by \( x \) gives something between 0 and \( x \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the limit of \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \) is \( n \). 

If this is the case for each term from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), then the entire sum inside the function \( f(x) \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \), and multiplying by \( x \) gives \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left( n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) \). Therefore, the limit as \( x \to 0 \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36 \). Hence, \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = 36 \), so setting \( 9k = 36 \), we get \( k = 4 \).

But wait, is this too straightforward? Let me check again. The problem is that even though each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \), maybe there&#x27;s a cumulative effect when summing all these terms. However, since each term individually tends to \( n \), and there are finitely many terms (8 terms), the sum should approach the sum of the limits, which is 36. Therefore, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36, so \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But let me try to verify this more carefully. Let&#x27;s take a specific example. Let&#x27;s pick \( x = 1/m \) where \( m \) is a positive integer going to infinity (since \( x \to 0 \) corresponds to \( m \to \infty \)). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n m \), which is an integer, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n m \). Therefore, multiplying by \( x = 1/m \), we get exactly \( n \). So in this case, \( f(1/m) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Therefore, along this sequence \( x = 1/m \), the limit is indeed 36.

However, what if \( x \) approaches 0 in a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer? Let&#x27;s suppose \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), where \( 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n(m + \theta) \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor n m + n \theta \rfloor = n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \). Then, multiplying by \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), we get:

\( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} = \frac{n m}{m + \theta} + \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \).

As \( m \to \infty \), the first term \( \frac{n m}{m + \theta} \approx n \cdot \frac{m}{m} = n \), and the second term \( \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \approx 0 \), since \( \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \) is bounded by \( n \theta &lt; n \). Therefore, even in this case, the limit as \( m \to \infty \) (i.e., \( x \to 0 \)) is \( n \). Therefore, regardless of how \( x \) approaches 0, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \), so the sum approaches 36. Thus, \( k = 4 \).

But let&#x27;s do a concrete numerical example. Suppose \( x = 0.0001 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = 10000 \), so \( \lfloor 1/x \rfloor = 10000 \), \( \lfloor 2/x \rfloor = 20000 \), up to \( \lfloor 8/x \rfloor = 80000 \). Then, the sum is \( 10000 + 20000 + \cdots + 80000 = 10000(1 + 2 + \cdots + 8) = 10000 \cdot 36 = 360000 \). Multiplying by \( x = 0.0001 \) gives \( 360000 \cdot 0.0001 = 36 \). So indeed, for such a small \( x \), \( f(x) = 36 \), which is exactly the value we need for continuity. Therefore, \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

Wait, but perhaps there&#x27;s a subtlety here. Suppose instead of taking \( x = 1/m \), we take \( x \) approaching 0 in such a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer. Let&#x27;s take \( x = \epsilon \), a very small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is some large number, say \( N + \delta \), where \( N = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = x N \). But \( \frac{n}{x} = N + \delta \implies x = \frac{n}{N + \delta} \). Therefore, \( x N = \frac{n N}{N + \delta} = n \cdot \frac{N}{N + \delta} \). As \( x \to 0 \), \( N \to \infty \), so \( \frac{N}{N + \delta} \to 1 \). Therefore, \( x N \to n \). Hence, even in this case, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Therefore, regardless of the path \( x \to 0 \), each term in the sum converges to \( n \), and since there are finitely many terms, the entire expression converges to 36. Therefore, \( k = 4 \).

But I want to be absolutely thorough here. Let me consider another approach. The function \( f(x) \) can be written as \( x \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). Let&#x27;s substitute \( t = \frac{1}{x} \), so as \( x \to 0^+ \), \( t \to +\infty \). Then, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \). So, the limit becomes \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \).

Now, for each \( n \), \( \lfloor n t \rfloor = n t - \{ n t \} \), where \( 0 \leq \{ n t \} &lt; 1 \). Therefore, \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \frac{1}{t} \left( \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \right ) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n - \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \).

As \( t \to \infty \), the term \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) goes to 0 because each \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, so the sum is bounded between 0 and 8, and dividing by \( t \) (which is going to infinity) gives 0. Therefore, the limit is \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Hence, again, the same conclusion: \( k = 4 \).

Alternatively, one might wonder if there&#x27;s a more complex behavior due to the interaction between different terms. For example, if the fractional parts \( \{ n t \} \) are not independent, maybe their sum fluctuates in a way that doesn&#x27;t vanish when divided by \( t \). However, since each term \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, the entire sum \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 8. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and \( \frac{8}{t} \), which clearly approaches 0 as \( t \to \infty \). Hence, the limit is indeed 36.

Just to be thorough, let&#x27;s consider the left-hand limit as \( x \to 0^- \). But since \( x \) approaches 0 from the left, \( x \) is negative. However, the original function is defined for \( x \neq 0 \), but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, and the floor function of a negative number can behave differently. Wait, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether \( x \) is approaching 0 from the right or left. However, continuity at 0 requires that the limit exists and is equal from both sides. But since \( x = 0 \) is approached from both sides, we need to check both.

Wait, but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to a negative number. For example, if \( \frac{n}{x} = -1.2 \), then \( \lfloor -1.2 \rfloor = -2 \). However, in that case, multiplying \( x \) (which is negative) by \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) (which is also negative) gives a positive product. But in the original problem, when \( x \) is positive (approaching 0 from the right), each term is positive. However, when approaching from the left, \( x \) is negative, and \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is negative, so their product is positive as well. Therefore, perhaps the function \( f(x) \) is positive in both cases.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. For \( x \to 0^- \), \( x \) is negative. Let me compute \( f(x) = x \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \). Since \( x \) is negative, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative. The floor of a negative number is more negative. For example, \( \lfloor -1.5 \rfloor = -2 \). So, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \leq \frac{n}{x} \), but since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, the floor function makes it even more negative. Then, multiplying by \( x \), which is also negative, gives a positive product. Let&#x27;s take an example. Suppose \( x = -0.1 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = -10 \), \( \lfloor -10 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} = -20 \), \( \lfloor -20 \rfloor = -20 \), and so on. So, each term \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n}{x} \) since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer here. Therefore, multiplying by \( x \), we have \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} = n \). Therefore, even for negative \( x \), if \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer, then \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n \), just like in the positive case. Therefore, the sum would again be \( 36 \).

But if \( x \) is negative and \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer, for example, \( x = -0.1 + \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon \) is a small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is slightly less negative than \( -10n \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = -10n - 1 \). Wait, let&#x27;s compute it. Let me take \( x = -0.11 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} \approx -18.1818 \), so \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \). Wait, but here, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is actually one less than the integer part if we look at the magnitude. For example, \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \), since -10 is the greatest integer less than or equal to -9.0909. Similarly, \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \).

Therefore, for \( x = -0.11 \), the term \( x \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \rfloor = (-0.11)(-10) = 1.1 \), but \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so the floor is -10, multiplied by x gives 1.1. However, the actual value of \( \frac{1}{x} \) is approximately -9.0909, so if we take the floor and multiply by x, we get a value slightly larger than 1. Wait, but when x is negative, is this value approaching the same limit?

Wait, let&#x27;s generalize. Let me consider \( x \to 0^- \). Let \( x = -t \), where \( t \to 0^+ \). Then, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \). Now, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \) is equal to \( -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), where \( \lceil y \rceil \) is the ceiling function. Alternatively, for any real number \( y \), \( \lfloor -y \rfloor = -\lceil y \rceil \). Therefore, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor = -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \).

Therefore, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \). Now, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{n}{t} \). Let \( \frac{n}{t} = m + \delta \), where \( m \) is a non-negative integer and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = m + 1 \) if \( \delta &gt; 0 \), otherwise \( m \) if \( \delta = 0 \). Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is not an integer, otherwise \( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \).

Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 - \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \), where \( \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \) is 1 if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer, 0 otherwise. However, for \( t \) approaching 0, the likelihood that \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer becomes negligible unless \( t \) is chosen specifically. So, generically, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \), except on a set of measure zero.

Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 ( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 ) \), except possibly when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer. Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0^+ \), the term \( 8 t \to 0 \). The first term \( t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) is similar to the original problem but approaching from the positive side. As established before, each \( t \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \to n \), so the sum approaches 36. Therefore, \( f(x) = 36 + 0 = 36 \).

However, this seems contradictory because when approaching from the negative side, we have an extra term \( 8t \), but in the limit as \( t \to 0 \), that term disappears. Therefore, both left and right limits are 36. Therefore, the function is continuous at 0 if \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But wait, when approaching from the negative side, we had \( f(x) = t \sum \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), and \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) (except when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer). Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum (\lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1) \). But \( \sum_{n=1}^8 1 = 8 \), so \( f(x) = t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0 \), \( t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) approaches 36 and \( 8 t \to 0 \). Therefore, the left-hand limit is also 36. Thus, the two-sided limit is 36, and therefore, \( k = 4 \).

Therefore, after carefully considering both right and left limits, as well as different ways \( x \) can approach 0, I conclude that the limit is indeed 36, so \( k = 4 \).

**Final Answer**
The value of \( k \) is \boxed{4}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \), we need to compute the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 and set it equal to \( f(0) = 9k \).

The function \( f(x) \) for \( x \neq 0 \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right)
\]

We analyze each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \). For each \( n \), as \( x \to 0 \), \( \frac{n}{x} \) becomes very large. The floor function \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying by \( x \) gives:
\[
x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor = x \left( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) = n - x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\}
\]

As \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) approaches 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is bounded between 0 and 1. Therefore, each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Summing these terms from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), we get:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^8 x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \to \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36
\]

Thus, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36. For continuity at \( x = 0 \), we set \( 9k = 36 \), leading to \( k = 4 \).

Verification for both left and right limits confirms that the limit is indeed 36, regardless of the direction from which \( x \) approaches 0. Therefore, the value of \( k \) is \(\boxed{4}\).          </p>

The function is defined as \( f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right) \) for \( x \neq 0 \), and \( f(0) = 9k \). For continuity at \( x = 0 \), the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 should equal \( f(0) \), so I need to compute \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) \) and set it equal to \( 9k \), then solve for \( k \).

First, let me recall that the greatest integer function \( \lfloor y \rfloor \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( y \). So, for each term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) where \( n \) ranges from 1 to 8, as \( x \) approaches 0, \( \frac{n}{x } \) becomes very large. Therefore, each floor function term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately equal to \( \frac{n}{x} \) minus some fractional part. But since we&#x27;re multiplying by \( x \), perhaps those fractional parts become negligible when multiplied by \( x \), especially in the limit as \( x \to 0 \).

Let me test this idea. Let&#x27;s consider a single term first: \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). If \( x \) is approaching 0, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is approaching infinity. The floor of \( \frac{n}{x} \) is \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying this by \( x \), we get \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} = n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \).

Now, as \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) should approach 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is between 0 and 1, so multiplying by \( x \) gives something between 0 and \( x \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the limit of \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \) is \( n \). 

If this is the case for each term from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), then the entire sum inside the function \( f(x) \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \), and multiplying by \( x \) gives \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left( n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) \). Therefore, the limit as \( x \to 0 \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36 \). Hence, \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = 36 \), so setting \( 9k = 36 \), we get \( k = 4 \).

But wait, is this too straightforward? Let me check again. The problem is that even though each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \), maybe there&#x27;s a cumulative effect when summing all these terms. However, since each term individually tends to \( n \), and there are finitely many terms (8 terms), the sum should approach the sum of the limits, which is 36. Therefore, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36, so \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But let me try to verify this more carefully. Let&#x27;s take a specific example. Let&#x27;s pick \( x = 1/m \) where \( m \) is a positive integer going to infinity (since \( x \to 0 \) corresponds to \( m \to \infty \)). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n m \), which is an integer, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n m \). Therefore, multiplying by \( x = 1/m \), we get exactly \( n \). So in this case, \( f(1/m) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Therefore, along this sequence \( x = 1/m \), the limit is indeed 36.

However, what if \( x \) approaches 0 in a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer? Let&#x27;s suppose \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), where \( 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n(m + \theta) \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor n m + n \theta \rfloor = n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \). Then, multiplying by \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), we get:

\( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} = \frac{n m}{m + \theta} + \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \).

As \( m \to \infty \), the first term \( \frac{n m}{m + \theta} \approx n \cdot \frac{m}{m} = n \), and the second term \( \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \approx 0 \), since \( \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \) is bounded by \( n \theta &lt; n \). Therefore, even in this case, the limit as \( m \to \infty \) (i.e., \( x \to 0 \)) is \( n \). Therefore, regardless of how \( x \) approaches 0, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \), so the sum approaches 36. Thus, \( k = 4 \).

But let&#x27;s do a concrete numerical example. Suppose \( x = 0.0001 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = 10000 \), so \( \lfloor 1/x \rfloor = 10000 \), \( \lfloor 2/x \rfloor = 20000 \), up to \( \lfloor 8/x \rfloor = 80000 \). Then, the sum is \( 10000 + 20000 + \cdots + 80000 = 10000(1 + 2 + \cdots + 8) = 10000 \cdot 36 = 360000 \). Multiplying by \( x = 0.0001 \) gives \( 360000 \cdot 0.0001 = 36 \). So indeed, for such a small \( x \), \( f(x) = 36 \), which is exactly the value we need for continuity. Therefore, \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

Wait, but perhaps there&#x27;s a subtlety here. Suppose instead of taking \( x = 1/m \), we take \( x \) approaching 0 in such a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer. Let&#x27;s take \( x = \epsilon \), a very small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is some large number, say \( N + \delta \), where \( N = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = x N \). But \( \frac{n}{x} = N + \delta \implies x = \frac{n}{N + \delta} \). Therefore, \( x N = \frac{n N}{N + \delta} = n \cdot \frac{N}{N + \delta} \). As \( x \to 0 \), \( N \to \infty \), so \( \frac{N}{N + \delta} \to 1 \). Therefore, \( x N \to n \). Hence, even in this case, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Therefore, regardless of the path \( x \to 0 \), each term in the sum converges to \( n \), and since there are finitely many terms, the entire expression converges to 36. Therefore, \( k = 4 \).

But I want to be absolutely thorough here. Let me consider another approach. The function \( f(x) \) can be written as \( x \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). Let&#x27;s substitute \( t = \frac{1}{x} \), so as \( x \to 0^+ \), \( t \to +\infty \). Then, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \). So, the limit becomes \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \).

Now, for each \( n \), \( \lfloor n t \rfloor = n t - \{ n t \} \), where \( 0 \leq \{ n t \} &lt; 1 \). Therefore, \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \frac{1}{t} \left( \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \right ) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n - \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \).

As \( t \to \infty \), the term \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) goes to 0 because each \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, so the sum is bounded between 0 and 8, and dividing by \( t \) (which is going to infinity) gives 0. Therefore, the limit is \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Hence, again, the same conclusion: \( k = 4 \).

Alternatively, one might wonder if there&#x27;s a more complex behavior due to the interaction between different terms. For example, if the fractional parts \( \{ n t \} \) are not independent, maybe their sum fluctuates in a way that doesn&#x27;t vanish when divided by \( t \). However, since each term \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, the entire sum \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 8. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and \( \frac{8}{t} \), which clearly approaches 0 as \( t \to \infty \). Hence, the limit is indeed 36.

Just to be thorough, let&#x27;s consider the left-hand limit as \( x \to 0^- \). But since \( x \) approaches 0 from the left, \( x \) is negative. However, the original function is defined for \( x \neq 0 \), but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, and the floor function of a negative number can behave differently. Wait, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether \( x \) is approaching 0 from the right or left. However, continuity at 0 requires that the limit exists and is equal from both sides. But since \( x = 0 \) is approached from both sides, we need to check both.

Wait, but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to a negative number. For example, if \( \frac{n}{x} = -1.2 \), then \( \lfloor -1.2 \rfloor = -2 \). However, in that case, multiplying \( x \) (which is negative) by \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) (which is also negative) gives a positive product. But in the original problem, when \( x \) is positive (approaching 0 from the right), each term is positive. However, when approaching from the left, \( x \) is negative, and \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is negative, so their product is positive as well. Therefore, perhaps the function \( f(x) \) is positive in both cases.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. For \( x \to 0^- \), \( x \) is negative. Let me compute \( f(x) = x \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \). Since \( x \) is negative, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative. The floor of a negative number is more negative. For example, \( \lfloor -1.5 \rfloor = -2 \). So, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \leq \frac{n}{x} \), but since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, the floor function makes it even more negative. Then, multiplying by \( x \), which is also negative, gives a positive product. Let&#x27;s take an example. Suppose \( x = -0.1 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = -10 \), \( \lfloor -10 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} = -20 \), \( \lfloor -20 \rfloor = -20 \), and so on. So, each term \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n}{x} \) since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer here. Therefore, multiplying by \( x \), we have \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} = n \). Therefore, even for negative \( x \), if \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer, then \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n \), just like in the positive case. Therefore, the sum would again be \( 36 \).

But if \( x \) is negative and \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer, for example, \( x = -0.1 + \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon \) is a small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is slightly less negative than \( -10n \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = -10n - 1 \). Wait, let&#x27;s compute it. Let me take \( x = -0.11 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} \approx -18.1818 \), so \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \). Wait, but here, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is actually one less than the integer part if we look at the magnitude. For example, \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \), since -10 is the greatest integer less than or equal to -9.0909. Similarly, \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \).

Therefore, for \( x = -0.11 \), the term \( x \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \rfloor = (-0.11)(-10) = 1.1 \), but \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so the floor is -10, multiplied by x gives 1.1. However, the actual value of \( \frac{1}{x} \) is approximately -9.0909, so if we take the floor and multiply by x, we get a value slightly larger than 1. Wait, but when x is negative, is this value approaching the same limit?

Wait, let&#x27;s generalize. Let me consider \( x \to 0^- \). Let \( x = -t \), where \( t \to 0^+ \). Then, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \). Now, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \) is equal to \( -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), where \( \lceil y \rceil \) is the ceiling function. Alternatively, for any real number \( y \), \( \lfloor -y \rfloor = -\lceil y \rceil \). Therefore, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor = -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \).

Therefore, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \). Now, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{n}{t} \). Let \( \frac{n}{t} = m + \delta \), where \( m \) is a non-negative integer and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = m + 1 \) if \( \delta &gt; 0 \), otherwise \( m \) if \( \delta = 0 \). Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is not an integer, otherwise \( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \).

Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 - \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \), where \( \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \) is 1 if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer, 0 otherwise. However, for \( t \) approaching 0, the likelihood that \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer becomes negligible unless \( t \) is chosen specifically. So, generically, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \), except on a set of measure zero.

Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 ( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 ) \), except possibly when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer. Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0^+ \), the term \( 8 t \to 0 \). The first term \( t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) is similar to the original problem but approaching from the positive side. As established before, each \( t \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \to n \), so the sum approaches 36. Therefore, \( f(x) = 36 + 0 = 36 \).

However, this seems contradictory because when approaching from the negative side, we have an extra term \( 8t \), but in the limit as \( t \to 0 \), that term disappears. Therefore, both left and right limits are 36. Therefore, the function is continuous at 0 if \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But wait, when approaching from the negative side, we had \( f(x) = t \sum \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), and \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) (except when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer). Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum (\lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1) \). But \( \sum_{n=1}^8 1 = 8 \), so \( f(x) = t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0 \), \( t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) approaches 36 and \( 8 t \to 0 \). Therefore, the left-hand limit is also 36. Thus, the two-sided limit is 36, and therefore, \( k = 4 \).

Therefore, after carefully considering both right and left limits, as well as different ways \( x \) can approach 0, I conclude that the limit is indeed 36, so \( k = 4 \).

**Final Answer**
The value of \( k \) is \boxed{4}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \), we need to compute the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 and set it equal to \( f(0) = 9k \).

The function \( f(x) \) for \( x \neq 0 \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right)
\]

We analyze each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \). For each \( n \), as \( x \to 0 \), \( \frac{n}{x} \) becomes very large. The floor function \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying by \( x \) gives:
\[
x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor = x \left( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) = n - x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\}
\]

As \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) approaches 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is bounded between 0 and 1. Therefore, each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Summing these terms from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), we get:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^8 x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \to \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36
\]

Thus, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36. For continuity at \( x = 0 \), we set \( 9k = 36 \), leading to \( k = 4 \).

Verification for both left and right limits confirms that the limit is indeed 36, regardless of the direction from which \( x \) approaches 0. Therefore, the value of \( k \) is \(\boxed{4}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \). The function is defined as \( f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right) \) for \( x \neq 0 \), and \( f(0) = 9k \). For continuity at \( x = 0 \), the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 should equal \( f(0) \), so I need to compute \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) \) and set it equal to \( 9k \), then solve for \( k \).

First, let me recall that the greatest integer function \( \lfloor y \rfloor \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( y \). So, for each term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) where \( n \) ranges from 1 to 8, as \( x \) approaches 0, \( \frac{n}{x } \) becomes very large. Therefore, each floor function term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately equal to \( \frac{n}{x} \) minus some fractional part. But since we&#x27;re multiplying by \( x \), perhaps those fractional parts become negligible when multiplied by \( x \), especially in the limit as \( x \to 0 \).

Let me test this idea. Let&#x27;s consider a single term first: \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). If \( x \) is approaching 0, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is approaching infinity. The floor of \( \frac{n}{x} \) is \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying this by \( x \), we get \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} = n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \).

Now, as \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) should approach 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is between 0 and 1, so multiplying by \( x \) gives something between 0 and \( x \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the limit of \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \) is \( n \). 

If this is the case for each term from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), then the entire sum inside the function \( f(x) \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \), and multiplying by \( x \) gives \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left( n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) \). Therefore, the limit as \( x \to 0 \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36 \). Hence, \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = 36 \), so setting \( 9k = 36 \), we get \( k = 4 \).

But wait, is this too straightforward? Let me check again. The problem is that even though each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \), maybe there&#x27;s a cumulative effect when summing all these terms. However, since each term individually tends to \( n \), and there are finitely many terms (8 terms), the sum should approach the sum of the limits, which is 36. Therefore, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36, so \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But let me try to verify this more carefully. Let&#x27;s take a specific example. Let&#x27;s pick \( x = 1/m \) where \( m \) is a positive integer going to infinity (since \( x \to 0 \) corresponds to \( m \to \infty \)). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n m \), which is an integer, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n m \). Therefore, multiplying by \( x = 1/m \), we get exactly \( n \). So in this case, \( f(1/m) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Therefore, along this sequence \( x = 1/m \), the limit is indeed 36.

However, what if \( x \) approaches 0 in a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer? Let&#x27;s suppose \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), where \( 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n(m + \theta) \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor n m + n \theta \rfloor = n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \). Then, multiplying by \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), we get:

\( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} = \frac{n m}{m + \theta} + \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \).

As \( m \to \infty \), the first term \( \frac{n m}{m + \theta} \approx n \cdot \frac{m}{m} = n \), and the second term \( \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \approx 0 \), since \( \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \) is bounded by \( n \theta &lt; n \). Therefore, even in this case, the limit as \( m \to \infty \) (i.e., \( x \to 0 \)) is \( n \). Therefore, regardless of how \( x \) approaches 0, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \), so the sum approaches 36. Thus, \( k = 4 \).

But let&#x27;s do a concrete numerical example. Suppose \( x = 0.0001 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = 10000 \), so \( \lfloor 1/x \rfloor = 10000 \), \( \lfloor 2/x \rfloor = 20000 \), up to \( \lfloor 8/x \rfloor = 80000 \). Then, the sum is \( 10000 + 20000 + \cdots + 80000 = 10000(1 + 2 + \cdots + 8) = 10000 \cdot 36 = 360000 \). Multiplying by \( x = 0.0001 \) gives \( 360000 \cdot 0.0001 = 36 \). So indeed, for such a small \( x \), \( f(x) = 36 \), which is exactly the value we need for continuity. Therefore, \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

Wait, but perhaps there&#x27;s a subtlety here. Suppose instead of taking \( x = 1/m \), we take \( x \) approaching 0 in such a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer. Let&#x27;s take \( x = \epsilon \), a very small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is some large number, say \( N + \delta \), where \( N = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = x N \). But \( \frac{n}{x} = N + \delta \implies x = \frac{n}{N + \delta} \). Therefore, \( x N = \frac{n N}{N + \delta} = n \cdot \frac{N}{N + \delta} \). As \( x \to 0 \), \( N \to \infty \), so \( \frac{N}{N + \delta} \to 1 \). Therefore, \( x N \to n \). Hence, even in this case, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Therefore, regardless of the path \( x \to 0 \), each term in the sum converges to \( n \), and since there are finitely many terms, the entire expression converges to 36. Therefore, \( k = 4 \).

But I want to be absolutely thorough here. Let me consider another approach. The function \( f(x) \) can be written as \( x \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). Let&#x27;s substitute \( t = \frac{1}{x} \), so as \( x \to 0^+ \), \( t \to +\infty \). Then, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \). So, the limit becomes \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \).

Now, for each \( n \), \( \lfloor n t \rfloor = n t - \{ n t \} \), where \( 0 \leq \{ n t \} &lt; 1 \). Therefore, \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \frac{1}{t} \left( \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \right ) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n - \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \).

As \( t \to \infty \), the term \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) goes to 0 because each \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, so the sum is bounded between 0 and 8, and dividing by \( t \) (which is going to infinity) gives 0. Therefore, the limit is \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Hence, again, the same conclusion: \( k = 4 \).

Alternatively, one might wonder if there&#x27;s a more complex behavior due to the interaction between different terms. For example, if the fractional parts \( \{ n t \} \) are not independent, maybe their sum fluctuates in a way that doesn&#x27;t vanish when divided by \( t \). However, since each term \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, the entire sum \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 8. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and \( \frac{8}{t} \), which clearly approaches 0 as \( t \to \infty \). Hence, the limit is indeed 36.

Just to be thorough, let&#x27;s consider the left-hand limit as \( x \to 0^- \). But since \( x \) approaches 0 from the left, \( x \) is negative. However, the original function is defined for \( x \neq 0 \), but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, and the floor function of a negative number can behave differently. Wait, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether \( x \) is approaching 0 from the right or left. However, continuity at 0 requires that the limit exists and is equal from both sides. But since \( x = 0 \) is approached from both sides, we need to check both.

Wait, but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to a negative number. For example, if \( \frac{n}{x} = -1.2 \), then \( \lfloor -1.2 \rfloor = -2 \). However, in that case, multiplying \( x \) (which is negative) by \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) (which is also negative) gives a positive product. But in the original problem, when \( x \) is positive (approaching 0 from the right), each term is positive. However, when approaching from the left, \( x \) is negative, and \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is negative, so their product is positive as well. Therefore, perhaps the function \( f(x) \) is positive in both cases.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. For \( x \to 0^- \), \( x \) is negative. Let me compute \( f(x) = x \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \). Since \( x \) is negative, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative. The floor of a negative number is more negative. For example, \( \lfloor -1.5 \rfloor = -2 \). So, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \leq \frac{n}{x} \), but since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, the floor function makes it even more negative. Then, multiplying by \( x \), which is also negative, gives a positive product. Let&#x27;s take an example. Suppose \( x = -0.1 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = -10 \), \( \lfloor -10 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} = -20 \), \( \lfloor -20 \rfloor = -20 \), and so on. So, each term \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n}{x} \) since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer here. Therefore, multiplying by \( x \), we have \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} = n \). Therefore, even for negative \( x \), if \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer, then \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n \), just like in the positive case. Therefore, the sum would again be \( 36 \).

But if \( x \) is negative and \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer, for example, \( x = -0.1 + \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon \) is a small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is slightly less negative than \( -10n \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = -10n - 1 \). Wait, let&#x27;s compute it. Let me take \( x = -0.11 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} \approx -18.1818 \), so \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \). Wait, but here, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is actually one less than the integer part if we look at the magnitude. For example, \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \), since -10 is the greatest integer less than or equal to -9.0909. Similarly, \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \).

Therefore, for \( x = -0.11 \), the term \( x \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \rfloor = (-0.11)(-10) = 1.1 \), but \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so the floor is -10, multiplied by x gives 1.1. However, the actual value of \( \frac{1}{x} \) is approximately -9.0909, so if we take the floor and multiply by x, we get a value slightly larger than 1. Wait, but when x is negative, is this value approaching the same limit?

Wait, let&#x27;s generalize. Let me consider \( x \to 0^- \). Let \( x = -t \), where \( t \to 0^+ \). Then, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \). Now, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \) is equal to \( -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), where \( \lceil y \rceil \) is the ceiling function. Alternatively, for any real number \( y \), \( \lfloor -y \rfloor = -\lceil y \rceil \). Therefore, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor = -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \).

Therefore, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \). Now, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{n}{t} \). Let \( \frac{n}{t} = m + \delta \), where \( m \) is a non-negative integer and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = m + 1 \) if \( \delta &gt; 0 \), otherwise \( m \) if \( \delta = 0 \). Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is not an integer, otherwise \( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \).

Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 - \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \), where \( \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \) is 1 if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer, 0 otherwise. However, for \( t \) approaching 0, the likelihood that \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer becomes negligible unless \( t \) is chosen specifically. So, generically, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \), except on a set of measure zero.

Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 ( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 ) \), except possibly when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer. Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0^+ \), the term \( 8 t \to 0 \). The first term \( t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) is similar to the original problem but approaching from the positive side. As established before, each \( t \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \to n \), so the sum approaches 36. Therefore, \( f(x) = 36 + 0 = 36 \).

However, this seems contradictory because when approaching from the negative side, we have an extra term \( 8t \), but in the limit as \( t \to 0 \), that term disappears. Therefore, both left and right limits are 36. Therefore, the function is continuous at 0 if \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But wait, when approaching from the negative side, we had \( f(x) = t \sum \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), and \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) (except when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer). Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum (\lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1) \). But \( \sum_{n=1}^8 1 = 8 \), so \( f(x) = t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0 \), \( t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) approaches 36 and \( 8 t \to 0 \). Therefore, the left-hand limit is also 36. Thus, the two-sided limit is 36, and therefore, \( k = 4 \).

Therefore, after carefully considering both right and left limits, as well as different ways \( x \) can approach 0, I conclude that the limit is indeed 36, so \( k = 4 \).

**Final Answer**
The value of \( k \) is \boxed{4}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \), we need to compute the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 and set it equal to \( f(0) = 9k \).

The function \( f(x) \) for \( x \neq 0 \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right)
\]

We analyze each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \). For each \( n \), as \( x \to 0 \), \( \frac{n}{x} \) becomes very large. The floor function \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying by \( x \) gives:
\[
x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor = x \left( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) = n - x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\}
\]

As \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) approaches 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is bounded between 0 and 1. Therefore, each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Summing these terms from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), we get:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^8 x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \to \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36
\]

Thus, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36. For continuity at \( x = 0 \), we set \( 9k = 36 \), leading to \( k = 4 \).

Verification for both left and right limits confirms that the limit is indeed 36, regardless of the direction from which \( x \) approaches 0. Therefore, the value of \( k \) is \(\boxed{4}\).          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \). The function is defined as \( f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right) \) for \( x \neq 0 \), and \( f(0) = 9k \). For continuity at \( x = 0 \), the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 should equal \( f(0) \), so I need to compute \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) \) and set it equal to \( 9k \), then solve for \( k \).

First, let me recall that the greatest integer function \( \lfloor y \rfloor \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( y \). So, for each term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) where \( n \) ranges from 1 to 8, as \( x \) approaches 0, \( \frac{n}{x } \) becomes very large. Therefore, each floor function term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately equal to \( \frac{n}{x} \) minus some fractional part. But since we&#x27;re multiplying by \( x \), perhaps those fractional parts become negligible when multiplied by \( x \), especially in the limit as \( x \to 0 \).

Let me test this idea. Let&#x27;s consider a single term first: \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). If \( x \) is approaching 0, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is approaching infinity. The floor of \( \frac{n}{x} \) is \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying this by \( x \), we get \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} = n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \).

Now, as \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) should approach 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is between 0 and 1, so multiplying by \( x \) gives something between 0 and \( x \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the limit of \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \) is \( n \). 

If this is the case for each term from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), then the entire sum inside the function \( f(x) \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \), and multiplying by \( x \) gives \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left( n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) \). Therefore, the limit as \( x \to 0 \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36 \). Hence, \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = 36 \), so setting \( 9k = 36 \), we get \( k = 4 \).

But wait, is this too straightforward? Let me check again. The problem is that even though each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \), maybe there&#x27;s a cumulative effect when summing all these terms. However, since each term individually tends to \( n \), and there are finitely many terms (8 terms), the sum should approach the sum of the limits, which is 36. Therefore, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36, so \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But let me try to verify this more carefully. Let&#x27;s take a specific example. Let&#x27;s pick \( x = 1/m \) where \( m \) is a positive integer going to infinity (since \( x \to 0 \) corresponds to \( m \to \infty \)). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n m \), which is an integer, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n m \). Therefore, multiplying by \( x = 1/m \), we get exactly \( n \). So in this case, \( f(1/m) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Therefore, along this sequence \( x = 1/m \), the limit is indeed 36.

However, what if \( x \) approaches 0 in a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer? Let&#x27;s suppose \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), where \( 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n(m + \theta) \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor n m + n \theta \rfloor = n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \). Then, multiplying by \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), we get:

\( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} = \frac{n m}{m + \theta} + \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \).

As \( m \to \infty \), the first term \( \frac{n m}{m + \theta} \approx n \cdot \frac{m}{m} = n \), and the second term \( \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \approx 0 \), since \( \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \) is bounded by \( n \theta &lt; n \). Therefore, even in this case, the limit as \( m \to \infty \) (i.e., \( x \to 0 \)) is \( n \). Therefore, regardless of how \( x \) approaches 0, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \), so the sum approaches 36. Thus, \( k = 4 \).

But let&#x27;s do a concrete numerical example. Suppose \( x = 0.0001 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = 10000 \), so \( \lfloor 1/x \rfloor = 10000 \), \( \lfloor 2/x \rfloor = 20000 \), up to \( \lfloor 8/x \rfloor = 80000 \). Then, the sum is \( 10000 + 20000 + \cdots + 80000 = 10000(1 + 2 + \cdots + 8) = 10000 \cdot 36 = 360000 \). Multiplying by \( x = 0.0001 \) gives \( 360000 \cdot 0.0001 = 36 \). So indeed, for such a small \( x \), \( f(x) = 36 \), which is exactly the value we need for continuity. Therefore, \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

Wait, but perhaps there&#x27;s a subtlety here. Suppose instead of taking \( x = 1/m \), we take \( x \) approaching 0 in such a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer. Let&#x27;s take \( x = \epsilon \), a very small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is some large number, say \( N + \delta \), where \( N = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = x N \). But \( \frac{n}{x} = N + \delta \implies x = \frac{n}{N + \delta} \). Therefore, \( x N = \frac{n N}{N + \delta} = n \cdot \frac{N}{N + \delta} \). As \( x \to 0 \), \( N \to \infty \), so \( \frac{N}{N + \delta} \to 1 \). Therefore, \( x N \to n \). Hence, even in this case, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Therefore, regardless of the path \( x \to 0 \), each term in the sum converges to \( n \), and since there are finitely many terms, the entire expression converges to 36. Therefore, \( k = 4 \).

But I want to be absolutely thorough here. Let me consider another approach. The function \( f(x) \) can be written as \( x \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). Let&#x27;s substitute \( t = \frac{1}{x} \), so as \( x \to 0^+ \), \( t \to +\infty \). Then, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \). So, the limit becomes \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \).

Now, for each \( n \), \( \lfloor n t \rfloor = n t - \{ n t \} \), where \( 0 \leq \{ n t \} &lt; 1 \). Therefore, \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \frac{1}{t} \left( \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \right ) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n - \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \).

As \( t \to \infty \), the term \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) goes to 0 because each \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, so the sum is bounded between 0 and 8, and dividing by \( t \) (which is going to infinity) gives 0. Therefore, the limit is \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Hence, again, the same conclusion: \( k = 4 \).

Alternatively, one might wonder if there&#x27;s a more complex behavior due to the interaction between different terms. For example, if the fractional parts \( \{ n t \} \) are not independent, maybe their sum fluctuates in a way that doesn&#x27;t vanish when divided by \( t \). However, since each term \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, the entire sum \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 8. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and \( \frac{8}{t} \), which clearly approaches 0 as \( t \to \infty \). Hence, the limit is indeed 36.

Just to be thorough, let&#x27;s consider the left-hand limit as \( x \to 0^- \). But since \( x \) approaches 0 from the left, \( x \) is negative. However, the original function is defined for \( x \neq 0 \), but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, and the floor function of a negative number can behave differently. Wait, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether \( x \) is approaching 0 from the right or left. However, continuity at 0 requires that the limit exists and is equal from both sides. But since \( x = 0 \) is approached from both sides, we need to check both.

Wait, but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to a negative number. For example, if \( \frac{n}{x} = -1.2 \), then \( \lfloor -1.2 \rfloor = -2 \). However, in that case, multiplying \( x \) (which is negative) by \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) (which is also negative) gives a positive product. But in the original problem, when \( x \) is positive (approaching 0 from the right), each term is positive. However, when approaching from the left, \( x \) is negative, and \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is negative, so their product is positive as well. Therefore, perhaps the function \( f(x) \) is positive in both cases.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. For \( x \to 0^- \), \( x \) is negative. Let me compute \( f(x) = x \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \). Since \( x \) is negative, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative. The floor of a negative number is more negative. For example, \( \lfloor -1.5 \rfloor = -2 \). So, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \leq \frac{n}{x} \), but since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, the floor function makes it even more negative. Then, multiplying by \( x \), which is also negative, gives a positive product. Let&#x27;s take an example. Suppose \( x = -0.1 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = -10 \), \( \lfloor -10 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} = -20 \), \( \lfloor -20 \rfloor = -20 \), and so on. So, each term \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n}{x} \) since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer here. Therefore, multiplying by \( x \), we have \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} = n \). Therefore, even for negative \( x \), if \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer, then \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n \), just like in the positive case. Therefore, the sum would again be \( 36 \).

But if \( x \) is negative and \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer, for example, \( x = -0.1 + \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon \) is a small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is slightly less negative than \( -10n \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = -10n - 1 \). Wait, let&#x27;s compute it. Let me take \( x = -0.11 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} \approx -18.1818 \), so \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \). Wait, but here, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is actually one less than the integer part if we look at the magnitude. For example, \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \), since -10 is the greatest integer less than or equal to -9.0909. Similarly, \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \).

Therefore, for \( x = -0.11 \), the term \( x \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \rfloor = (-0.11)(-10) = 1.1 \), but \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so the floor is -10, multiplied by x gives 1.1. However, the actual value of \( \frac{1}{x} \) is approximately -9.0909, so if we take the floor and multiply by x, we get a value slightly larger than 1. Wait, but when x is negative, is this value approaching the same limit?

Wait, let&#x27;s generalize. Let me consider \( x \to 0^- \). Let \( x = -t \), where \( t \to 0^+ \). Then, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \). Now, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \) is equal to \( -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), where \( \lceil y \rceil \) is the ceiling function. Alternatively, for any real number \( y \), \( \lfloor -y \rfloor = -\lceil y \rceil \). Therefore, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor = -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \).

Therefore, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \). Now, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{n}{t} \). Let \( \frac{n}{t} = m + \delta \), where \( m \) is a non-negative integer and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = m + 1 \) if \( \delta &gt; 0 \), otherwise \( m \) if \( \delta = 0 \). Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is not an integer, otherwise \( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \).

Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 - \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \), where \( \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \) is 1 if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer, 0 otherwise. However, for \( t \) approaching 0, the likelihood that \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer becomes negligible unless \( t \) is chosen specifically. So, generically, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \), except on a set of measure zero.

Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 ( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 ) \), except possibly when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer. Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0^+ \), the term \( 8 t \to 0 \). The first term \( t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) is similar to the original problem but approaching from the positive side. As established before, each \( t \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \to n \), so the sum approaches 36. Therefore, \( f(x) = 36 + 0 = 36 \).

However, this seems contradictory because when approaching from the negative side, we have an extra term \( 8t \), but in the limit as \( t \to 0 \), that term disappears. Therefore, both left and right limits are 36. Therefore, the function is continuous at 0 if \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But wait, when approaching from the negative side, we had \( f(x) = t \sum \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), and \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) (except when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer). Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum (\lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1) \). But \( \sum_{n=1}^8 1 = 8 \), so \( f(x) = t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0 \), \( t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) approaches 36 and \( 8 t \to 0 \). Therefore, the left-hand limit is also 36. Thus, the two-sided limit is 36, and therefore, \( k = 4 \).

Therefore, after carefully considering both right and left limits, as well as different ways \( x \) can approach 0, I conclude that the limit is indeed 36, so \( k = 4 \).

**Final Answer**
The value of \( k \) is \boxed{4}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \), we need to compute the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 and set it equal to \( f(0) = 9k \).

The function \( f(x) \) for \( x \neq 0 \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right)
\]

We analyze each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \). For each \( n \), as \( x \to 0 \), \( \frac{n}{x} \) becomes very large. The floor function \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying by \( x \) gives:
\[
x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor = x \left( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) = n - x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\}
\]

As \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) approaches 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is bounded between 0 and 1. Therefore, each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Summing these terms from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), we get:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^8 x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \to \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36
\]

Thus, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36. For continuity at \( x = 0 \), we set \( 9k = 36 \), leading to \( k = 4 \).

Verification for both left and right limits confirms that the limit is indeed 36, regardless of the direction from which \( x \) approaches 0. Therefore, the value of \( k \) is \(\boxed{4}\).          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \). The function is defined as \( f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right) \) for \( x \neq 0 \), and \( f(0) = 9k \). For continuity at \( x = 0 \), the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 should equal \( f(0) \), so I need to compute \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) \) and set it equal to \( 9k \), then solve for \( k \).

First, let me recall that the greatest integer function \( \lfloor y \rfloor \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( y \). So, for each term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) where \( n \) ranges from 1 to 8, as \( x \) approaches 0, \( \frac{n}{x } \) becomes very large. Therefore, each floor function term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately equal to \( \frac{n}{x} \) minus some fractional part. But since we&#x27;re multiplying by \( x \), perhaps those fractional parts become negligible when multiplied by \( x \), especially in the limit as \( x \to 0 \).

Let me test this idea. Let&#x27;s consider a single term first: \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). If \( x \) is approaching 0, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is approaching infinity. The floor of \( \frac{n}{x} \) is \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying this by \( x \), we get \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} = n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \).

Now, as \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) should approach 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is between 0 and 1, so multiplying by \( x \) gives something between 0 and \( x \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the limit of \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \) is \( n \). 

If this is the case for each term from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), then the entire sum inside the function \( f(x) \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \), and multiplying by \( x \) gives \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left( n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) \). Therefore, the limit as \( x \to 0 \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36 \). Hence, \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = 36 \), so setting \( 9k = 36 \), we get \( k = 4 \).

But wait, is this too straightforward? Let me check again. The problem is that even though each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \), maybe there&#x27;s a cumulative effect when summing all these terms. However, since each term individually tends to \( n \), and there are finitely many terms (8 terms), the sum should approach the sum of the limits, which is 36. Therefore, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36, so \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But let me try to verify this more carefully. Let&#x27;s take a specific example. Let&#x27;s pick \( x = 1/m \) where \( m \) is a positive integer going to infinity (since \( x \to 0 \) corresponds to \( m \to \infty \)). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n m \), which is an integer, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n m \). Therefore, multiplying by \( x = 1/m \), we get exactly \( n \). So in this case, \( f(1/m) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Therefore, along this sequence \( x = 1/m \), the limit is indeed 36.

However, what if \( x \) approaches 0 in a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer? Let&#x27;s suppose \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), where \( 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n(m + \theta) \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor n m + n \theta \rfloor = n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \). Then, multiplying by \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), we get:

\( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} = \frac{n m}{m + \theta} + \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \).

As \( m \to \infty \), the first term \( \frac{n m}{m + \theta} \approx n \cdot \frac{m}{m} = n \), and the second term \( \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \approx 0 \), since \( \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \) is bounded by \( n \theta &lt; n \). Therefore, even in this case, the limit as \( m \to \infty \) (i.e., \( x \to 0 \)) is \( n \). Therefore, regardless of how \( x \) approaches 0, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \), so the sum approaches 36. Thus, \( k = 4 \).

But let&#x27;s do a concrete numerical example. Suppose \( x = 0.0001 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = 10000 \), so \( \lfloor 1/x \rfloor = 10000 \), \( \lfloor 2/x \rfloor = 20000 \), up to \( \lfloor 8/x \rfloor = 80000 \). Then, the sum is \( 10000 + 20000 + \cdots + 80000 = 10000(1 + 2 + \cdots + 8) = 10000 \cdot 36 = 360000 \). Multiplying by \( x = 0.0001 \) gives \( 360000 \cdot 0.0001 = 36 \). So indeed, for such a small \( x \), \( f(x) = 36 \), which is exactly the value we need for continuity. Therefore, \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

Wait, but perhaps there&#x27;s a subtlety here. Suppose instead of taking \( x = 1/m \), we take \( x \) approaching 0 in such a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer. Let&#x27;s take \( x = \epsilon \), a very small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is some large number, say \( N + \delta \), where \( N = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = x N \). But \( \frac{n}{x} = N + \delta \implies x = \frac{n}{N + \delta} \). Therefore, \( x N = \frac{n N}{N + \delta} = n \cdot \frac{N}{N + \delta} \). As \( x \to 0 \), \( N \to \infty \), so \( \frac{N}{N + \delta} \to 1 \). Therefore, \( x N \to n \). Hence, even in this case, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Therefore, regardless of the path \( x \to 0 \), each term in the sum converges to \( n \), and since there are finitely many terms, the entire expression converges to 36. Therefore, \( k = 4 \).

But I want to be absolutely thorough here. Let me consider another approach. The function \( f(x) \) can be written as \( x \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). Let&#x27;s substitute \( t = \frac{1}{x} \), so as \( x \to 0^+ \), \( t \to +\infty \). Then, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \). So, the limit becomes \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \).

Now, for each \( n \), \( \lfloor n t \rfloor = n t - \{ n t \} \), where \( 0 \leq \{ n t \} &lt; 1 \). Therefore, \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \frac{1}{t} \left( \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \right ) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n - \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \).

As \( t \to \infty \), the term \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) goes to 0 because each \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, so the sum is bounded between 0 and 8, and dividing by \( t \) (which is going to infinity) gives 0. Therefore, the limit is \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Hence, again, the same conclusion: \( k = 4 \).

Alternatively, one might wonder if there&#x27;s a more complex behavior due to the interaction between different terms. For example, if the fractional parts \( \{ n t \} \) are not independent, maybe their sum fluctuates in a way that doesn&#x27;t vanish when divided by \( t \). However, since each term \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, the entire sum \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 8. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and \( \frac{8}{t} \), which clearly approaches 0 as \( t \to \infty \). Hence, the limit is indeed 36.

Just to be thorough, let&#x27;s consider the left-hand limit as \( x \to 0^- \). But since \( x \) approaches 0 from the left, \( x \) is negative. However, the original function is defined for \( x \neq 0 \), but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, and the floor function of a negative number can behave differently. Wait, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether \( x \) is approaching 0 from the right or left. However, continuity at 0 requires that the limit exists and is equal from both sides. But since \( x = 0 \) is approached from both sides, we need to check both.

Wait, but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to a negative number. For example, if \( \frac{n}{x} = -1.2 \), then \( \lfloor -1.2 \rfloor = -2 \). However, in that case, multiplying \( x \) (which is negative) by \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) (which is also negative) gives a positive product. But in the original problem, when \( x \) is positive (approaching 0 from the right), each term is positive. However, when approaching from the left, \( x \) is negative, and \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is negative, so their product is positive as well. Therefore, perhaps the function \( f(x) \) is positive in both cases.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. For \( x \to 0^- \), \( x \) is negative. Let me compute \( f(x) = x \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \). Since \( x \) is negative, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative. The floor of a negative number is more negative. For example, \( \lfloor -1.5 \rfloor = -2 \). So, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \leq \frac{n}{x} \), but since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, the floor function makes it even more negative. Then, multiplying by \( x \), which is also negative, gives a positive product. Let&#x27;s take an example. Suppose \( x = -0.1 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = -10 \), \( \lfloor -10 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} = -20 \), \( \lfloor -20 \rfloor = -20 \), and so on. So, each term \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n}{x} \) since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer here. Therefore, multiplying by \( x \), we have \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} = n \). Therefore, even for negative \( x \), if \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer, then \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n \), just like in the positive case. Therefore, the sum would again be \( 36 \).

But if \( x \) is negative and \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer, for example, \( x = -0.1 + \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon \) is a small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is slightly less negative than \( -10n \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = -10n - 1 \). Wait, let&#x27;s compute it. Let me take \( x = -0.11 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} \approx -18.1818 \), so \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \). Wait, but here, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is actually one less than the integer part if we look at the magnitude. For example, \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \), since -10 is the greatest integer less than or equal to -9.0909. Similarly, \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \).

Therefore, for \( x = -0.11 \), the term \( x \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \rfloor = (-0.11)(-10) = 1.1 \), but \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so the floor is -10, multiplied by x gives 1.1. However, the actual value of \( \frac{1}{x} \) is approximately -9.0909, so if we take the floor and multiply by x, we get a value slightly larger than 1. Wait, but when x is negative, is this value approaching the same limit?

Wait, let&#x27;s generalize. Let me consider \( x \to 0^- \). Let \( x = -t \), where \( t \to 0^+ \). Then, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \). Now, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \) is equal to \( -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), where \( \lceil y \rceil \) is the ceiling function. Alternatively, for any real number \( y \), \( \lfloor -y \rfloor = -\lceil y \rceil \). Therefore, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor = -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \).

Therefore, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \). Now, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{n}{t} \). Let \( \frac{n}{t} = m + \delta \), where \( m \) is a non-negative integer and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = m + 1 \) if \( \delta &gt; 0 \), otherwise \( m \) if \( \delta = 0 \). Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is not an integer, otherwise \( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \).

Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 - \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \), where \( \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \) is 1 if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer, 0 otherwise. However, for \( t \) approaching 0, the likelihood that \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer becomes negligible unless \( t \) is chosen specifically. So, generically, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \), except on a set of measure zero.

Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 ( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 ) \), except possibly when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer. Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0^+ \), the term \( 8 t \to 0 \). The first term \( t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) is similar to the original problem but approaching from the positive side. As established before, each \( t \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \to n \), so the sum approaches 36. Therefore, \( f(x) = 36 + 0 = 36 \).

However, this seems contradictory because when approaching from the negative side, we have an extra term \( 8t \), but in the limit as \( t \to 0 \), that term disappears. Therefore, both left and right limits are 36. Therefore, the function is continuous at 0 if \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But wait, when approaching from the negative side, we had \( f(x) = t \sum \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), and \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) (except when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer). Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum (\lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1) \). But \( \sum_{n=1}^8 1 = 8 \), so \( f(x) = t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0 \), \( t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) approaches 36 and \( 8 t \to 0 \). Therefore, the left-hand limit is also 36. Thus, the two-sided limit is 36, and therefore, \( k = 4 \).

Therefore, after carefully considering both right and left limits, as well as different ways \( x \) can approach 0, I conclude that the limit is indeed 36, so \( k = 4 \).

**Final Answer**
The value of \( k \) is \boxed{4}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \), we need to compute the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 and set it equal to \( f(0) = 9k \).

The function \( f(x) \) for \( x \neq 0 \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right)
\]

We analyze each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \). For each \( n \), as \( x \to 0 \), \( \frac{n}{x} \) becomes very large. The floor function \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying by \( x \) gives:
\[
x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor = x \left( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) = n - x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\}
\]

As \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) approaches 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is bounded between 0 and 1. Therefore, each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Summing these terms from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), we get:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^8 x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \to \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36
\]

Thus, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36. For continuity at \( x = 0 \), we set \( 9k = 36 \), leading to \( k = 4 \).

Verification for both left and right limits confirms that the limit is indeed 36, regardless of the direction from which \( x \) approaches 0. Therefore, the value of \( k \) is \(\boxed{4}\).          </p>

Response: \( k = 9 \boxed{9} \)          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \). The function is defined as \( f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right) \) for \( x \neq 0 \), and \( f(0) = 9k \). For continuity at \( x = 0 \), the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 should equal \( f(0) \), so I need to compute \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) \) and set it equal to \( 9k \), then solve for \( k \).

First, let me recall that the greatest integer function \( \lfloor y \rfloor \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( y \). So, for each term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) where \( n \) ranges from 1 to 8, as \( x \) approaches 0, \( \frac{n}{x } \) becomes very large. Therefore, each floor function term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately equal to \( \frac{n}{x} \) minus some fractional part. But since we&#x27;re multiplying by \( x \), perhaps those fractional parts become negligible when multiplied by \( x \), especially in the limit as \( x \to 0 \).

Let me test this idea. Let&#x27;s consider a single term first: \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). If \( x \) is approaching 0, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is approaching infinity. The floor of \( \frac{n}{x} \) is \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying this by \( x \), we get \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} = n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \).

Now, as \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) should approach 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is between 0 and 1, so multiplying by \( x \) gives something between 0 and \( x \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the limit of \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \) is \( n \). 

If this is the case for each term from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), then the entire sum inside the function \( f(x) \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \), and multiplying by \( x \) gives \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left( n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) \). Therefore, the limit as \( x \to 0 \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36 \). Hence, \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = 36 \), so setting \( 9k = 36 \), we get \( k = 4 \).

But wait, is this too straightforward? Let me check again. The problem is that even though each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \), maybe there&#x27;s a cumulative effect when summing all these terms. However, since each term individually tends to \( n \), and there are finitely many terms (8 terms), the sum should approach the sum of the limits, which is 36. Therefore, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36, so \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But let me try to verify this more carefully. Let&#x27;s take a specific example. Let&#x27;s pick \( x = 1/m \) where \( m \) is a positive integer going to infinity (since \( x \to 0 \) corresponds to \( m \to \infty \)). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n m \), which is an integer, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n m \). Therefore, multiplying by \( x = 1/m \), we get exactly \( n \). So in this case, \( f(1/m) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Therefore, along this sequence \( x = 1/m \), the limit is indeed 36.

However, what if \( x \) approaches 0 in a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer? Let&#x27;s suppose \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), where \( 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n(m + \theta) \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor n m + n \theta \rfloor = n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \). Then, multiplying by \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), we get:

\( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} = \frac{n m}{m + \theta} + \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \).

As \( m \to \infty \), the first term \( \frac{n m}{m + \theta} \approx n \cdot \frac{m}{m} = n \), and the second term \( \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \approx 0 \), since \( \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \) is bounded by \( n \theta &lt; n \). Therefore, even in this case, the limit as \( m \to \infty \) (i.e., \( x \to 0 \)) is \( n \). Therefore, regardless of how \( x \) approaches 0, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \), so the sum approaches 36. Thus, \( k = 4 \).

But let&#x27;s do a concrete numerical example. Suppose \( x = 0.0001 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = 10000 \), so \( \lfloor 1/x \rfloor = 10000 \), \( \lfloor 2/x \rfloor = 20000 \), up to \( \lfloor 8/x \rfloor = 80000 \). Then, the sum is \( 10000 + 20000 + \cdots + 80000 = 10000(1 + 2 + \cdots + 8) = 10000 \cdot 36 = 360000 \). Multiplying by \( x = 0.0001 \) gives \( 360000 \cdot 0.0001 = 36 \). So indeed, for such a small \( x \), \( f(x) = 36 \), which is exactly the value we need for continuity. Therefore, \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

Wait, but perhaps there&#x27;s a subtlety here. Suppose instead of taking \( x = 1/m \), we take \( x \) approaching 0 in such a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer. Let&#x27;s take \( x = \epsilon \), a very small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is some large number, say \( N + \delta \), where \( N = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = x N \). But \( \frac{n}{x} = N + \delta \implies x = \frac{n}{N + \delta} \). Therefore, \( x N = \frac{n N}{N + \delta} = n \cdot \frac{N}{N + \delta} \). As \( x \to 0 \), \( N \to \infty \), so \( \frac{N}{N + \delta} \to 1 \). Therefore, \( x N \to n \). Hence, even in this case, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Therefore, regardless of the path \( x \to 0 \), each term in the sum converges to \( n \), and since there are finitely many terms, the entire expression converges to 36. Therefore, \( k = 4 \).

But I want to be absolutely thorough here. Let me consider another approach. The function \( f(x) \) can be written as \( x \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). Let&#x27;s substitute \( t = \frac{1}{x} \), so as \( x \to 0^+ \), \( t \to +\infty \). Then, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \). So, the limit becomes \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \).

Now, for each \( n \), \( \lfloor n t \rfloor = n t - \{ n t \} \), where \( 0 \leq \{ n t \} &lt; 1 \). Therefore, \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \frac{1}{t} \left( \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \right ) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n - \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \).

As \( t \to \infty \), the term \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) goes to 0 because each \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, so the sum is bounded between 0 and 8, and dividing by \( t \) (which is going to infinity) gives 0. Therefore, the limit is \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Hence, again, the same conclusion: \( k = 4 \).

Alternatively, one might wonder if there&#x27;s a more complex behavior due to the interaction between different terms. For example, if the fractional parts \( \{ n t \} \) are not independent, maybe their sum fluctuates in a way that doesn&#x27;t vanish when divided by \( t \). However, since each term \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, the entire sum \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 8. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and \( \frac{8}{t} \), which clearly approaches 0 as \( t \to \infty \). Hence, the limit is indeed 36.

Just to be thorough, let&#x27;s consider the left-hand limit as \( x \to 0^- \). But since \( x \) approaches 0 from the left, \( x \) is negative. However, the original function is defined for \( x \neq 0 \), but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, and the floor function of a negative number can behave differently. Wait, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether \( x \) is approaching 0 from the right or left. However, continuity at 0 requires that the limit exists and is equal from both sides. But since \( x = 0 \) is approached from both sides, we need to check both.

Wait, but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to a negative number. For example, if \( \frac{n}{x} = -1.2 \), then \( \lfloor -1.2 \rfloor = -2 \). However, in that case, multiplying \( x \) (which is negative) by \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) (which is also negative) gives a positive product. But in the original problem, when \( x \) is positive (approaching 0 from the right), each term is positive. However, when approaching from the left, \( x \) is negative, and \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is negative, so their product is positive as well. Therefore, perhaps the function \( f(x) \) is positive in both cases.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. For \( x \to 0^- \), \( x \) is negative. Let me compute \( f(x) = x \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \). Since \( x \) is negative, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative. The floor of a negative number is more negative. For example, \( \lfloor -1.5 \rfloor = -2 \). So, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \leq \frac{n}{x} \), but since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, the floor function makes it even more negative. Then, multiplying by \( x \), which is also negative, gives a positive product. Let&#x27;s take an example. Suppose \( x = -0.1 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = -10 \), \( \lfloor -10 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} = -20 \), \( \lfloor -20 \rfloor = -20 \), and so on. So, each term \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n}{x} \) since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer here. Therefore, multiplying by \( x \), we have \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} = n \). Therefore, even for negative \( x \), if \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer, then \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n \), just like in the positive case. Therefore, the sum would again be \( 36 \).

But if \( x \) is negative and \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer, for example, \( x = -0.1 + \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon \) is a small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is slightly less negative than \( -10n \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = -10n - 1 \). Wait, let&#x27;s compute it. Let me take \( x = -0.11 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} \approx -18.1818 \), so \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \). Wait, but here, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is actually one less than the integer part if we look at the magnitude. For example, \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \), since -10 is the greatest integer less than or equal to -9.0909. Similarly, \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \).

Therefore, for \( x = -0.11 \), the term \( x \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \rfloor = (-0.11)(-10) = 1.1 \), but \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so the floor is -10, multiplied by x gives 1.1. However, the actual value of \( \frac{1}{x} \) is approximately -9.0909, so if we take the floor and multiply by x, we get a value slightly larger than 1. Wait, but when x is negative, is this value approaching the same limit?

Wait, let&#x27;s generalize. Let me consider \( x \to 0^- \). Let \( x = -t \), where \( t \to 0^+ \). Then, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \). Now, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \) is equal to \( -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), where \( \lceil y \rceil \) is the ceiling function. Alternatively, for any real number \( y \), \( \lfloor -y \rfloor = -\lceil y \rceil \). Therefore, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor = -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \).

Therefore, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \). Now, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{n}{t} \). Let \( \frac{n}{t} = m + \delta \), where \( m \) is a non-negative integer and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = m + 1 \) if \( \delta &gt; 0 \), otherwise \( m \) if \( \delta = 0 \). Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is not an integer, otherwise \( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \).

Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 - \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \), where \( \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \) is 1 if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer, 0 otherwise. However, for \( t \) approaching 0, the likelihood that \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer becomes negligible unless \( t \) is chosen specifically. So, generically, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \), except on a set of measure zero.

Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 ( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 ) \), except possibly when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer. Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0^+ \), the term \( 8 t \to 0 \). The first term \( t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) is similar to the original problem but approaching from the positive side. As established before, each \( t \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \to n \), so the sum approaches 36. Therefore, \( f(x) = 36 + 0 = 36 \).

However, this seems contradictory because when approaching from the negative side, we have an extra term \( 8t \), but in the limit as \( t \to 0 \), that term disappears. Therefore, both left and right limits are 36. Therefore, the function is continuous at 0 if \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But wait, when approaching from the negative side, we had \( f(x) = t \sum \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), and \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) (except when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer). Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum (\lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1) \). But \( \sum_{n=1}^8 1 = 8 \), so \( f(x) = t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0 \), \( t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) approaches 36 and \( 8 t \to 0 \). Therefore, the left-hand limit is also 36. Thus, the two-sided limit is 36, and therefore, \( k = 4 \).

Therefore, after carefully considering both right and left limits, as well as different ways \( x \) can approach 0, I conclude that the limit is indeed 36, so \( k = 4 \).

**Final Answer**
The value of \( k \) is \boxed{4}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \), we need to compute the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 and set it equal to \( f(0) = 9k \).

The function \( f(x) \) for \( x \neq 0 \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right)
\]

We analyze each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \). For each \( n \), as \( x \to 0 \), \( \frac{n}{x} \) becomes very large. The floor function \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying by \( x \) gives:
\[
x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor = x \left( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) = n - x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\}
\]

As \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) approaches 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is bounded between 0 and 1. Therefore, each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Summing these terms from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), we get:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^8 x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \to \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36
\]

Thus, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36. For continuity at \( x = 0 \), we set \( 9k = 36 \), leading to \( k = 4 \).

Verification for both left and right limits confirms that the limit is indeed 36, regardless of the direction from which \( x \) approaches 0. Therefore, the value of \( k \) is \(\boxed{4}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \). The function is defined as \( f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right) \) for \( x \neq 0 \), and \( f(0) = 9k \). For continuity at \( x = 0 \), the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 should equal \( f(0) \), so I need to compute \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) \) and set it equal to \( 9k \), then solve for \( k \).

First, let me recall that the greatest integer function \( \lfloor y \rfloor \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( y \). So, for each term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) where \( n \) ranges from 1 to 8, as \( x \) approaches 0, \( \frac{n}{x } \) becomes very large. Therefore, each floor function term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately equal to \( \frac{n}{x} \) minus some fractional part. But since we&#x27;re multiplying by \( x \), perhaps those fractional parts become negligible when multiplied by \( x \), especially in the limit as \( x \to 0 \).

Let me test this idea. Let&#x27;s consider a single term first: \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). If \( x \) is approaching 0, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is approaching infinity. The floor of \( \frac{n}{x} \) is \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying this by \( x \), we get \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} = n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \).

Now, as \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) should approach 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is between 0 and 1, so multiplying by \( x \) gives something between 0 and \( x \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the limit of \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \) is \( n \). 

If this is the case for each term from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), then the entire sum inside the function \( f(x) \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \), and multiplying by \( x \) gives \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left( n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) \). Therefore, the limit as \( x \to 0 \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36 \). Hence, \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = 36 \), so setting \( 9k = 36 \), we get \( k = 4 \).

But wait, is this too straightforward? Let me check again. The problem is that even though each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \), maybe there&#x27;s a cumulative effect when summing all these terms. However, since each term individually tends to \( n \), and there are finitely many terms (8 terms), the sum should approach the sum of the limits, which is 36. Therefore, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36, so \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But let me try to verify this more carefully. Let&#x27;s take a specific example. Let&#x27;s pick \( x = 1/m \) where \( m \) is a positive integer going to infinity (since \( x \to 0 \) corresponds to \( m \to \infty \)). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n m \), which is an integer, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n m \). Therefore, multiplying by \( x = 1/m \), we get exactly \( n \). So in this case, \( f(1/m) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Therefore, along this sequence \( x = 1/m \), the limit is indeed 36.

However, what if \( x \) approaches 0 in a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer? Let&#x27;s suppose \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), where \( 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n(m + \theta) \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor n m + n \theta \rfloor = n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \). Then, multiplying by \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), we get:

\( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} = \frac{n m}{m + \theta} + \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \).

As \( m \to \infty \), the first term \( \frac{n m}{m + \theta} \approx n \cdot \frac{m}{m} = n \), and the second term \( \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \approx 0 \), since \( \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \) is bounded by \( n \theta &lt; n \). Therefore, even in this case, the limit as \( m \to \infty \) (i.e., \( x \to 0 \)) is \( n \). Therefore, regardless of how \( x \) approaches 0, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \), so the sum approaches 36. Thus, \( k = 4 \).

But let&#x27;s do a concrete numerical example. Suppose \( x = 0.0001 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = 10000 \), so \( \lfloor 1/x \rfloor = 10000 \), \( \lfloor 2/x \rfloor = 20000 \), up to \( \lfloor 8/x \rfloor = 80000 \). Then, the sum is \( 10000 + 20000 + \cdots + 80000 = 10000(1 + 2 + \cdots + 8) = 10000 \cdot 36 = 360000 \). Multiplying by \( x = 0.0001 \) gives \( 360000 \cdot 0.0001 = 36 \). So indeed, for such a small \( x \), \( f(x) = 36 \), which is exactly the value we need for continuity. Therefore, \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

Wait, but perhaps there&#x27;s a subtlety here. Suppose instead of taking \( x = 1/m \), we take \( x \) approaching 0 in such a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer. Let&#x27;s take \( x = \epsilon \), a very small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is some large number, say \( N + \delta \), where \( N = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = x N \). But \( \frac{n}{x} = N + \delta \implies x = \frac{n}{N + \delta} \). Therefore, \( x N = \frac{n N}{N + \delta} = n \cdot \frac{N}{N + \delta} \). As \( x \to 0 \), \( N \to \infty \), so \( \frac{N}{N + \delta} \to 1 \). Therefore, \( x N \to n \). Hence, even in this case, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Therefore, regardless of the path \( x \to 0 \), each term in the sum converges to \( n \), and since there are finitely many terms, the entire expression converges to 36. Therefore, \( k = 4 \).

But I want to be absolutely thorough here. Let me consider another approach. The function \( f(x) \) can be written as \( x \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). Let&#x27;s substitute \( t = \frac{1}{x} \), so as \( x \to 0^+ \), \( t \to +\infty \). Then, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \). So, the limit becomes \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \).

Now, for each \( n \), \( \lfloor n t \rfloor = n t - \{ n t \} \), where \( 0 \leq \{ n t \} &lt; 1 \). Therefore, \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \frac{1}{t} \left( \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \right ) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n - \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \).

As \( t \to \infty \), the term \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) goes to 0 because each \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, so the sum is bounded between 0 and 8, and dividing by \( t \) (which is going to infinity) gives 0. Therefore, the limit is \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Hence, again, the same conclusion: \( k = 4 \).

Alternatively, one might wonder if there&#x27;s a more complex behavior due to the interaction between different terms. For example, if the fractional parts \( \{ n t \} \) are not independent, maybe their sum fluctuates in a way that doesn&#x27;t vanish when divided by \( t \). However, since each term \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, the entire sum \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 8. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and \( \frac{8}{t} \), which clearly approaches 0 as \( t \to \infty \). Hence, the limit is indeed 36.

Just to be thorough, let&#x27;s consider the left-hand limit as \( x \to 0^- \). But since \( x \) approaches 0 from the left, \( x \) is negative. However, the original function is defined for \( x \neq 0 \), but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, and the floor function of a negative number can behave differently. Wait, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether \( x \) is approaching 0 from the right or left. However, continuity at 0 requires that the limit exists and is equal from both sides. But since \( x = 0 \) is approached from both sides, we need to check both.

Wait, but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to a negative number. For example, if \( \frac{n}{x} = -1.2 \), then \( \lfloor -1.2 \rfloor = -2 \). However, in that case, multiplying \( x \) (which is negative) by \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) (which is also negative) gives a positive product. But in the original problem, when \( x \) is positive (approaching 0 from the right), each term is positive. However, when approaching from the left, \( x \) is negative, and \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is negative, so their product is positive as well. Therefore, perhaps the function \( f(x) \) is positive in both cases.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. For \( x \to 0^- \), \( x \) is negative. Let me compute \( f(x) = x \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \). Since \( x \) is negative, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative. The floor of a negative number is more negative. For example, \( \lfloor -1.5 \rfloor = -2 \). So, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \leq \frac{n}{x} \), but since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, the floor function makes it even more negative. Then, multiplying by \( x \), which is also negative, gives a positive product. Let&#x27;s take an example. Suppose \( x = -0.1 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = -10 \), \( \lfloor -10 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} = -20 \), \( \lfloor -20 \rfloor = -20 \), and so on. So, each term \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n}{x} \) since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer here. Therefore, multiplying by \( x \), we have \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} = n \). Therefore, even for negative \( x \), if \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer, then \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n \), just like in the positive case. Therefore, the sum would again be \( 36 \).

But if \( x \) is negative and \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer, for example, \( x = -0.1 + \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon \) is a small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is slightly less negative than \( -10n \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = -10n - 1 \). Wait, let&#x27;s compute it. Let me take \( x = -0.11 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} \approx -18.1818 \), so \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \). Wait, but here, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is actually one less than the integer part if we look at the magnitude. For example, \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \), since -10 is the greatest integer less than or equal to -9.0909. Similarly, \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \).

Therefore, for \( x = -0.11 \), the term \( x \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \rfloor = (-0.11)(-10) = 1.1 \), but \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so the floor is -10, multiplied by x gives 1.1. However, the actual value of \( \frac{1}{x} \) is approximately -9.0909, so if we take the floor and multiply by x, we get a value slightly larger than 1. Wait, but when x is negative, is this value approaching the same limit?

Wait, let&#x27;s generalize. Let me consider \( x \to 0^- \). Let \( x = -t \), where \( t \to 0^+ \). Then, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \). Now, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \) is equal to \( -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), where \( \lceil y \rceil \) is the ceiling function. Alternatively, for any real number \( y \), \( \lfloor -y \rfloor = -\lceil y \rceil \). Therefore, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor = -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \).

Therefore, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \). Now, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{n}{t} \). Let \( \frac{n}{t} = m + \delta \), where \( m \) is a non-negative integer and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = m + 1 \) if \( \delta &gt; 0 \), otherwise \( m \) if \( \delta = 0 \). Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is not an integer, otherwise \( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \).

Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 - \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \), where \( \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \) is 1 if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer, 0 otherwise. However, for \( t \) approaching 0, the likelihood that \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer becomes negligible unless \( t \) is chosen specifically. So, generically, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \), except on a set of measure zero.

Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 ( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 ) \), except possibly when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer. Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0^+ \), the term \( 8 t \to 0 \). The first term \( t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) is similar to the original problem but approaching from the positive side. As established before, each \( t \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \to n \), so the sum approaches 36. Therefore, \( f(x) = 36 + 0 = 36 \).

However, this seems contradictory because when approaching from the negative side, we have an extra term \( 8t \), but in the limit as \( t \to 0 \), that term disappears. Therefore, both left and right limits are 36. Therefore, the function is continuous at 0 if \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But wait, when approaching from the negative side, we had \( f(x) = t \sum \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), and \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) (except when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer). Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum (\lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1) \). But \( \sum_{n=1}^8 1 = 8 \), so \( f(x) = t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0 \), \( t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) approaches 36 and \( 8 t \to 0 \). Therefore, the left-hand limit is also 36. Thus, the two-sided limit is 36, and therefore, \( k = 4 \).

Therefore, after carefully considering both right and left limits, as well as different ways \( x \) can approach 0, I conclude that the limit is indeed 36, so \( k = 4 \).

**Final Answer**
The value of \( k \) is \boxed{4}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \), we need to compute the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 and set it equal to \( f(0) = 9k \).

The function \( f(x) \) for \( x \neq 0 \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right)
\]

We analyze each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \). For each \( n \), as \( x \to 0 \), \( \frac{n}{x} \) becomes very large. The floor function \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying by \( x \) gives:
\[
x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor = x \left( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) = n - x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\}
\]

As \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) approaches 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is bounded between 0 and 1. Therefore, each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Summing these terms from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), we get:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^8 x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \to \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36
\]

Thus, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36. For continuity at \( x = 0 \), we set \( 9k = 36 \), leading to \( k = 4 \).

Verification for both left and right limits confirms that the limit is indeed 36, regardless of the direction from which \( x \) approaches 0. Therefore, the value of \( k \) is \(\boxed{4}\).          </p>

The function is defined as \( f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right) \) for \( x \neq 0 \), and \( f(0) = 9k \). For continuity at \( x = 0 \), the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 should equal \( f(0) \), so I need to compute \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) \) and set it equal to \( 9k \), then solve for \( k \).

First, let me recall that the greatest integer function \( \lfloor y \rfloor \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( y \). So, for each term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) where \( n \) ranges from 1 to 8, as \( x \) approaches 0, \( \frac{n}{x } \) becomes very large. Therefore, each floor function term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately equal to \( \frac{n}{x} \) minus some fractional part. But since we&#x27;re multiplying by \( x \), perhaps those fractional parts become negligible when multiplied by \( x \), especially in the limit as \( x \to 0 \).

Let me test this idea. Let&#x27;s consider a single term first: \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). If \( x \) is approaching 0, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is approaching infinity. The floor of \( \frac{n}{x} \) is \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying this by \( x \), we get \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} = n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \).

Now, as \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) should approach 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is between 0 and 1, so multiplying by \( x \) gives something between 0 and \( x \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the limit of \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \) is \( n \). 

If this is the case for each term from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), then the entire sum inside the function \( f(x) \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \), and multiplying by \( x \) gives \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left( n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) \). Therefore, the limit as \( x \to 0 \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36 \). Hence, \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = 36 \), so setting \( 9k = 36 \), we get \( k = 4 \).

But wait, is this too straightforward? Let me check again. The problem is that even though each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \), maybe there&#x27;s a cumulative effect when summing all these terms. However, since each term individually tends to \( n \), and there are finitely many terms (8 terms), the sum should approach the sum of the limits, which is 36. Therefore, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36, so \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But let me try to verify this more carefully. Let&#x27;s take a specific example. Let&#x27;s pick \( x = 1/m \) where \( m \) is a positive integer going to infinity (since \( x \to 0 \) corresponds to \( m \to \infty \)). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n m \), which is an integer, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n m \). Therefore, multiplying by \( x = 1/m \), we get exactly \( n \). So in this case, \( f(1/m) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Therefore, along this sequence \( x = 1/m \), the limit is indeed 36.

However, what if \( x \) approaches 0 in a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer? Let&#x27;s suppose \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), where \( 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n(m + \theta) \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor n m + n \theta \rfloor = n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \). Then, multiplying by \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), we get:

\( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} = \frac{n m}{m + \theta} + \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \).

As \( m \to \infty \), the first term \( \frac{n m}{m + \theta} \approx n \cdot \frac{m}{m} = n \), and the second term \( \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \approx 0 \), since \( \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \) is bounded by \( n \theta &lt; n \). Therefore, even in this case, the limit as \( m \to \infty \) (i.e., \( x \to 0 \)) is \( n \). Therefore, regardless of how \( x \) approaches 0, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \), so the sum approaches 36. Thus, \( k = 4 \).

But let&#x27;s do a concrete numerical example. Suppose \( x = 0.0001 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = 10000 \), so \( \lfloor 1/x \rfloor = 10000 \), \( \lfloor 2/x \rfloor = 20000 \), up to \( \lfloor 8/x \rfloor = 80000 \). Then, the sum is \( 10000 + 20000 + \cdots + 80000 = 10000(1 + 2 + \cdots + 8) = 10000 \cdot 36 = 360000 \). Multiplying by \( x = 0.0001 \) gives \( 360000 \cdot 0.0001 = 36 \). So indeed, for such a small \( x \), \( f(x) = 36 \), which is exactly the value we need for continuity. Therefore, \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

Wait, but perhaps there&#x27;s a subtlety here. Suppose instead of taking \( x = 1/m \), we take \( x \) approaching 0 in such a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer. Let&#x27;s take \( x = \epsilon \), a very small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is some large number, say \( N + \delta \), where \( N = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = x N \). But \( \frac{n}{x} = N + \delta \implies x = \frac{n}{N + \delta} \). Therefore, \( x N = \frac{n N}{N + \delta} = n \cdot \frac{N}{N + \delta} \). As \( x \to 0 \), \( N \to \infty \), so \( \frac{N}{N + \delta} \to 1 \). Therefore, \( x N \to n \). Hence, even in this case, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Therefore, regardless of the path \( x \to 0 \), each term in the sum converges to \( n \), and since there are finitely many terms, the entire expression converges to 36. Therefore, \( k = 4 \).

But I want to be absolutely thorough here. Let me consider another approach. The function \( f(x) \) can be written as \( x \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). Let&#x27;s substitute \( t = \frac{1}{x} \), so as \( x \to 0^+ \), \( t \to +\infty \). Then, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \). So, the limit becomes \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \).

Now, for each \( n \), \( \lfloor n t \rfloor = n t - \{ n t \} \), where \( 0 \leq \{ n t \} &lt; 1 \). Therefore, \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \frac{1}{t} \left( \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \right ) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n - \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \).

As \( t \to \infty \), the term \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) goes to 0 because each \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, so the sum is bounded between 0 and 8, and dividing by \( t \) (which is going to infinity) gives 0. Therefore, the limit is \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Hence, again, the same conclusion: \( k = 4 \).

Alternatively, one might wonder if there&#x27;s a more complex behavior due to the interaction between different terms. For example, if the fractional parts \( \{ n t \} \) are not independent, maybe their sum fluctuates in a way that doesn&#x27;t vanish when divided by \( t \). However, since each term \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, the entire sum \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 8. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and \( \frac{8}{t} \), which clearly approaches 0 as \( t \to \infty \). Hence, the limit is indeed 36.

Just to be thorough, let&#x27;s consider the left-hand limit as \( x \to 0^- \). But since \( x \) approaches 0 from the left, \( x \) is negative. However, the original function is defined for \( x \neq 0 \), but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, and the floor function of a negative number can behave differently. Wait, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether \( x \) is approaching 0 from the right or left. However, continuity at 0 requires that the limit exists and is equal from both sides. But since \( x = 0 \) is approached from both sides, we need to check both.

Wait, but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to a negative number. For example, if \( \frac{n}{x} = -1.2 \), then \( \lfloor -1.2 \rfloor = -2 \). However, in that case, multiplying \( x \) (which is negative) by \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) (which is also negative) gives a positive product. But in the original problem, when \( x \) is positive (approaching 0 from the right), each term is positive. However, when approaching from the left, \( x \) is negative, and \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is negative, so their product is positive as well. Therefore, perhaps the function \( f(x) \) is positive in both cases.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. For \( x \to 0^- \), \( x \) is negative. Let me compute \( f(x) = x \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \). Since \( x \) is negative, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative. The floor of a negative number is more negative. For example, \( \lfloor -1.5 \rfloor = -2 \). So, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \leq \frac{n}{x} \), but since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, the floor function makes it even more negative. Then, multiplying by \( x \), which is also negative, gives a positive product. Let&#x27;s take an example. Suppose \( x = -0.1 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = -10 \), \( \lfloor -10 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} = -20 \), \( \lfloor -20 \rfloor = -20 \), and so on. So, each term \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n}{x} \) since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer here. Therefore, multiplying by \( x \), we have \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} = n \). Therefore, even for negative \( x \), if \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer, then \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n \), just like in the positive case. Therefore, the sum would again be \( 36 \).

But if \( x \) is negative and \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer, for example, \( x = -0.1 + \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon \) is a small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is slightly less negative than \( -10n \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = -10n - 1 \). Wait, let&#x27;s compute it. Let me take \( x = -0.11 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} \approx -18.1818 \), so \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \). Wait, but here, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is actually one less than the integer part if we look at the magnitude. For example, \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \), since -10 is the greatest integer less than or equal to -9.0909. Similarly, \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \).

Therefore, for \( x = -0.11 \), the term \( x \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \rfloor = (-0.11)(-10) = 1.1 \), but \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so the floor is -10, multiplied by x gives 1.1. However, the actual value of \( \frac{1}{x} \) is approximately -9.0909, so if we take the floor and multiply by x, we get a value slightly larger than 1. Wait, but when x is negative, is this value approaching the same limit?

Wait, let&#x27;s generalize. Let me consider \( x \to 0^- \). Let \( x = -t \), where \( t \to 0^+ \). Then, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \). Now, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \) is equal to \( -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), where \( \lceil y \rceil \) is the ceiling function. Alternatively, for any real number \( y \), \( \lfloor -y \rfloor = -\lceil y \rceil \). Therefore, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor = -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \).

Therefore, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \). Now, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{n}{t} \). Let \( \frac{n}{t} = m + \delta \), where \( m \) is a non-negative integer and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = m + 1 \) if \( \delta &gt; 0 \), otherwise \( m \) if \( \delta = 0 \). Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is not an integer, otherwise \( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \).

Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 - \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \), where \( \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \) is 1 if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer, 0 otherwise. However, for \( t \) approaching 0, the likelihood that \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer becomes negligible unless \( t \) is chosen specifically. So, generically, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \), except on a set of measure zero.

Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 ( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 ) \), except possibly when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer. Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0^+ \), the term \( 8 t \to 0 \). The first term \( t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) is similar to the original problem but approaching from the positive side. As established before, each \( t \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \to n \), so the sum approaches 36. Therefore, \( f(x) = 36 + 0 = 36 \).

However, this seems contradictory because when approaching from the negative side, we have an extra term \( 8t \), but in the limit as \( t \to 0 \), that term disappears. Therefore, both left and right limits are 36. Therefore, the function is continuous at 0 if \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But wait, when approaching from the negative side, we had \( f(x) = t \sum \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), and \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) (except when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer). Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum (\lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1) \). But \( \sum_{n=1}^8 1 = 8 \), so \( f(x) = t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0 \), \( t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) approaches 36 and \( 8 t \to 0 \). Therefore, the left-hand limit is also 36. Thus, the two-sided limit is 36, and therefore, \( k = 4 \).

Therefore, after carefully considering both right and left limits, as well as different ways \( x \) can approach 0, I conclude that the limit is indeed 36, so \( k = 4 \).

**Final Answer**
The value of \( k \) is \boxed{4}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \), we need to compute the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 and set it equal to \( f(0) = 9k \).

The function \( f(x) \) for \( x \neq 0 \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right)
\]

We analyze each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \). For each \( n \), as \( x \to 0 \), \( \frac{n}{x} \) becomes very large. The floor function \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying by \( x \) gives:
\[
x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor = x \left( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) = n - x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\}
\]

As \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) approaches 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is bounded between 0 and 1. Therefore, each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Summing these terms from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), we get:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^8 x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \to \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36
\]

Thus, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36. For continuity at \( x = 0 \), we set \( 9k = 36 \), leading to \( k = 4 \).

Verification for both left and right limits confirms that the limit is indeed 36, regardless of the direction from which \( x \) approaches 0. Therefore, the value of \( k \) is \(\boxed{4}\).          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \). The function is defined as \( f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right) \) for \( x \neq 0 \), and \( f(0) = 9k \). For continuity at \( x = 0 \), the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 should equal \( f(0) \), so I need to compute \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) \) and set it equal to \( 9k \), then solve for \( k \).

First, let me recall that the greatest integer function \( \lfloor y \rfloor \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( y \). So, for each term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) where \( n \) ranges from 1 to 8, as \( x \) approaches 0, \( \frac{n}{x } \) becomes very large. Therefore, each floor function term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately equal to \( \frac{n}{x} \) minus some fractional part. But since we&#x27;re multiplying by \( x \), perhaps those fractional parts become negligible when multiplied by \( x \), especially in the limit as \( x \to 0 \).

Let me test this idea. Let&#x27;s consider a single term first: \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). If \( x \) is approaching 0, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is approaching infinity. The floor of \( \frac{n}{x} \) is \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying this by \( x \), we get \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} = n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \).

Now, as \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) should approach 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is between 0 and 1, so multiplying by \( x \) gives something between 0 and \( x \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the limit of \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \) is \( n \). 

If this is the case for each term from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), then the entire sum inside the function \( f(x) \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \), and multiplying by \( x \) gives \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left( n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) \). Therefore, the limit as \( x \to 0 \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36 \). Hence, \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = 36 \), so setting \( 9k = 36 \), we get \( k = 4 \).

But wait, is this too straightforward? Let me check again. The problem is that even though each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \), maybe there&#x27;s a cumulative effect when summing all these terms. However, since each term individually tends to \( n \), and there are finitely many terms (8 terms), the sum should approach the sum of the limits, which is 36. Therefore, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36, so \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But let me try to verify this more carefully. Let&#x27;s take a specific example. Let&#x27;s pick \( x = 1/m \) where \( m \) is a positive integer going to infinity (since \( x \to 0 \) corresponds to \( m \to \infty \)). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n m \), which is an integer, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n m \). Therefore, multiplying by \( x = 1/m \), we get exactly \( n \). So in this case, \( f(1/m) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Therefore, along this sequence \( x = 1/m \), the limit is indeed 36.

However, what if \( x \) approaches 0 in a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer? Let&#x27;s suppose \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), where \( 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n(m + \theta) \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor n m + n \theta \rfloor = n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \). Then, multiplying by \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), we get:

\( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} = \frac{n m}{m + \theta} + \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \).

As \( m \to \infty \), the first term \( \frac{n m}{m + \theta} \approx n \cdot \frac{m}{m} = n \), and the second term \( \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \approx 0 \), since \( \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \) is bounded by \( n \theta &lt; n \). Therefore, even in this case, the limit as \( m \to \infty \) (i.e., \( x \to 0 \)) is \( n \). Therefore, regardless of how \( x \) approaches 0, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \), so the sum approaches 36. Thus, \( k = 4 \).

But let&#x27;s do a concrete numerical example. Suppose \( x = 0.0001 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = 10000 \), so \( \lfloor 1/x \rfloor = 10000 \), \( \lfloor 2/x \rfloor = 20000 \), up to \( \lfloor 8/x \rfloor = 80000 \). Then, the sum is \( 10000 + 20000 + \cdots + 80000 = 10000(1 + 2 + \cdots + 8) = 10000 \cdot 36 = 360000 \). Multiplying by \( x = 0.0001 \) gives \( 360000 \cdot 0.0001 = 36 \). So indeed, for such a small \( x \), \( f(x) = 36 \), which is exactly the value we need for continuity. Therefore, \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

Wait, but perhaps there&#x27;s a subtlety here. Suppose instead of taking \( x = 1/m \), we take \( x \) approaching 0 in such a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer. Let&#x27;s take \( x = \epsilon \), a very small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is some large number, say \( N + \delta \), where \( N = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = x N \). But \( \frac{n}{x} = N + \delta \implies x = \frac{n}{N + \delta} \). Therefore, \( x N = \frac{n N}{N + \delta} = n \cdot \frac{N}{N + \delta} \). As \( x \to 0 \), \( N \to \infty \), so \( \frac{N}{N + \delta} \to 1 \). Therefore, \( x N \to n \). Hence, even in this case, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Therefore, regardless of the path \( x \to 0 \), each term in the sum converges to \( n \), and since there are finitely many terms, the entire expression converges to 36. Therefore, \( k = 4 \).

But I want to be absolutely thorough here. Let me consider another approach. The function \( f(x) \) can be written as \( x \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). Let&#x27;s substitute \( t = \frac{1}{x} \), so as \( x \to 0^+ \), \( t \to +\infty \). Then, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \). So, the limit becomes \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \).

Now, for each \( n \), \( \lfloor n t \rfloor = n t - \{ n t \} \), where \( 0 \leq \{ n t \} &lt; 1 \). Therefore, \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \frac{1}{t} \left( \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \right ) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n - \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \).

As \( t \to \infty \), the term \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) goes to 0 because each \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, so the sum is bounded between 0 and 8, and dividing by \( t \) (which is going to infinity) gives 0. Therefore, the limit is \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Hence, again, the same conclusion: \( k = 4 \).

Alternatively, one might wonder if there&#x27;s a more complex behavior due to the interaction between different terms. For example, if the fractional parts \( \{ n t \} \) are not independent, maybe their sum fluctuates in a way that doesn&#x27;t vanish when divided by \( t \). However, since each term \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, the entire sum \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 8. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and \( \frac{8}{t} \), which clearly approaches 0 as \( t \to \infty \). Hence, the limit is indeed 36.

Just to be thorough, let&#x27;s consider the left-hand limit as \( x \to 0^- \). But since \( x \) approaches 0 from the left, \( x \) is negative. However, the original function is defined for \( x \neq 0 \), but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, and the floor function of a negative number can behave differently. Wait, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether \( x \) is approaching 0 from the right or left. However, continuity at 0 requires that the limit exists and is equal from both sides. But since \( x = 0 \) is approached from both sides, we need to check both.

Wait, but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to a negative number. For example, if \( \frac{n}{x} = -1.2 \), then \( \lfloor -1.2 \rfloor = -2 \). However, in that case, multiplying \( x \) (which is negative) by \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) (which is also negative) gives a positive product. But in the original problem, when \( x \) is positive (approaching 0 from the right), each term is positive. However, when approaching from the left, \( x \) is negative, and \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is negative, so their product is positive as well. Therefore, perhaps the function \( f(x) \) is positive in both cases.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. For \( x \to 0^- \), \( x \) is negative. Let me compute \( f(x) = x \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \). Since \( x \) is negative, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative. The floor of a negative number is more negative. For example, \( \lfloor -1.5 \rfloor = -2 \). So, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \leq \frac{n}{x} \), but since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, the floor function makes it even more negative. Then, multiplying by \( x \), which is also negative, gives a positive product. Let&#x27;s take an example. Suppose \( x = -0.1 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = -10 \), \( \lfloor -10 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} = -20 \), \( \lfloor -20 \rfloor = -20 \), and so on. So, each term \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n}{x} \) since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer here. Therefore, multiplying by \( x \), we have \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} = n \). Therefore, even for negative \( x \), if \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer, then \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n \), just like in the positive case. Therefore, the sum would again be \( 36 \).

But if \( x \) is negative and \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer, for example, \( x = -0.1 + \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon \) is a small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is slightly less negative than \( -10n \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = -10n - 1 \). Wait, let&#x27;s compute it. Let me take \( x = -0.11 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} \approx -18.1818 \), so \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \). Wait, but here, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is actually one less than the integer part if we look at the magnitude. For example, \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \), since -10 is the greatest integer less than or equal to -9.0909. Similarly, \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \).

Therefore, for \( x = -0.11 \), the term \( x \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \rfloor = (-0.11)(-10) = 1.1 \), but \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so the floor is -10, multiplied by x gives 1.1. However, the actual value of \( \frac{1}{x} \) is approximately -9.0909, so if we take the floor and multiply by x, we get a value slightly larger than 1. Wait, but when x is negative, is this value approaching the same limit?

Wait, let&#x27;s generalize. Let me consider \( x \to 0^- \). Let \( x = -t \), where \( t \to 0^+ \). Then, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \). Now, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \) is equal to \( -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), where \( \lceil y \rceil \) is the ceiling function. Alternatively, for any real number \( y \), \( \lfloor -y \rfloor = -\lceil y \rceil \). Therefore, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor = -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \).

Therefore, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \). Now, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{n}{t} \). Let \( \frac{n}{t} = m + \delta \), where \( m \) is a non-negative integer and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = m + 1 \) if \( \delta &gt; 0 \), otherwise \( m \) if \( \delta = 0 \). Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is not an integer, otherwise \( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \).

Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 - \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \), where \( \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \) is 1 if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer, 0 otherwise. However, for \( t \) approaching 0, the likelihood that \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer becomes negligible unless \( t \) is chosen specifically. So, generically, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \), except on a set of measure zero.

Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 ( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 ) \), except possibly when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer. Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0^+ \), the term \( 8 t \to 0 \). The first term \( t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) is similar to the original problem but approaching from the positive side. As established before, each \( t \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \to n \), so the sum approaches 36. Therefore, \( f(x) = 36 + 0 = 36 \).

However, this seems contradictory because when approaching from the negative side, we have an extra term \( 8t \), but in the limit as \( t \to 0 \), that term disappears. Therefore, both left and right limits are 36. Therefore, the function is continuous at 0 if \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But wait, when approaching from the negative side, we had \( f(x) = t \sum \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), and \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) (except when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer). Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum (\lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1) \). But \( \sum_{n=1}^8 1 = 8 \), so \( f(x) = t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0 \), \( t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) approaches 36 and \( 8 t \to 0 \). Therefore, the left-hand limit is also 36. Thus, the two-sided limit is 36, and therefore, \( k = 4 \).

Therefore, after carefully considering both right and left limits, as well as different ways \( x \) can approach 0, I conclude that the limit is indeed 36, so \( k = 4 \).

**Final Answer**
The value of \( k \) is \boxed{4}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \), we need to compute the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 and set it equal to \( f(0) = 9k \).

The function \( f(x) \) for \( x \neq 0 \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right)
\]

We analyze each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \). For each \( n \), as \( x \to 0 \), \( \frac{n}{x} \) becomes very large. The floor function \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying by \( x \) gives:
\[
x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor = x \left( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) = n - x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\}
\]

As \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) approaches 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is bounded between 0 and 1. Therefore, each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Summing these terms from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), we get:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^8 x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \to \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36
\]

Thus, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36. For continuity at \( x = 0 \), we set \( 9k = 36 \), leading to \( k = 4 \).

Verification for both left and right limits confirms that the limit is indeed 36, regardless of the direction from which \( x \) approaches 0. Therefore, the value of \( k \) is \(\boxed{4}\).          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \). The function is defined as \( f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right) \) for \( x \neq 0 \), and \( f(0) = 9k \). For continuity at \( x = 0 \), the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 should equal \( f(0) \), so I need to compute \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) \) and set it equal to \( 9k \), then solve for \( k \).

First, let me recall that the greatest integer function \( \lfloor y \rfloor \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( y \). So, for each term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) where \( n \) ranges from 1 to 8, as \( x \) approaches 0, \( \frac{n}{x } \) becomes very large. Therefore, each floor function term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately equal to \( \frac{n}{x} \) minus some fractional part. But since we&#x27;re multiplying by \( x \), perhaps those fractional parts become negligible when multiplied by \( x \), especially in the limit as \( x \to 0 \).

Let me test this idea. Let&#x27;s consider a single term first: \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). If \( x \) is approaching 0, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is approaching infinity. The floor of \( \frac{n}{x} \) is \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying this by \( x \), we get \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} = n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \).

Now, as \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) should approach 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is between 0 and 1, so multiplying by \( x \) gives something between 0 and \( x \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the limit of \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \) is \( n \). 

If this is the case for each term from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), then the entire sum inside the function \( f(x) \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \), and multiplying by \( x \) gives \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left( n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) \). Therefore, the limit as \( x \to 0 \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36 \). Hence, \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = 36 \), so setting \( 9k = 36 \), we get \( k = 4 \).

But wait, is this too straightforward? Let me check again. The problem is that even though each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \), maybe there&#x27;s a cumulative effect when summing all these terms. However, since each term individually tends to \( n \), and there are finitely many terms (8 terms), the sum should approach the sum of the limits, which is 36. Therefore, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36, so \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But let me try to verify this more carefully. Let&#x27;s take a specific example. Let&#x27;s pick \( x = 1/m \) where \( m \) is a positive integer going to infinity (since \( x \to 0 \) corresponds to \( m \to \infty \)). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n m \), which is an integer, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n m \). Therefore, multiplying by \( x = 1/m \), we get exactly \( n \). So in this case, \( f(1/m) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Therefore, along this sequence \( x = 1/m \), the limit is indeed 36.

However, what if \( x \) approaches 0 in a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer? Let&#x27;s suppose \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), where \( 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n(m + \theta) \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor n m + n \theta \rfloor = n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \). Then, multiplying by \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), we get:

\( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} = \frac{n m}{m + \theta} + \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \).

As \( m \to \infty \), the first term \( \frac{n m}{m + \theta} \approx n \cdot \frac{m}{m} = n \), and the second term \( \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \approx 0 \), since \( \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \) is bounded by \( n \theta &lt; n \). Therefore, even in this case, the limit as \( m \to \infty \) (i.e., \( x \to 0 \)) is \( n \). Therefore, regardless of how \( x \) approaches 0, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \), so the sum approaches 36. Thus, \( k = 4 \).

But let&#x27;s do a concrete numerical example. Suppose \( x = 0.0001 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = 10000 \), so \( \lfloor 1/x \rfloor = 10000 \), \( \lfloor 2/x \rfloor = 20000 \), up to \( \lfloor 8/x \rfloor = 80000 \). Then, the sum is \( 10000 + 20000 + \cdots + 80000 = 10000(1 + 2 + \cdots + 8) = 10000 \cdot 36 = 360000 \). Multiplying by \( x = 0.0001 \) gives \( 360000 \cdot 0.0001 = 36 \). So indeed, for such a small \( x \), \( f(x) = 36 \), which is exactly the value we need for continuity. Therefore, \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

Wait, but perhaps there&#x27;s a subtlety here. Suppose instead of taking \( x = 1/m \), we take \( x \) approaching 0 in such a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer. Let&#x27;s take \( x = \epsilon \), a very small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is some large number, say \( N + \delta \), where \( N = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = x N \). But \( \frac{n}{x} = N + \delta \implies x = \frac{n}{N + \delta} \). Therefore, \( x N = \frac{n N}{N + \delta} = n \cdot \frac{N}{N + \delta} \). As \( x \to 0 \), \( N \to \infty \), so \( \frac{N}{N + \delta} \to 1 \). Therefore, \( x N \to n \). Hence, even in this case, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Therefore, regardless of the path \( x \to 0 \), each term in the sum converges to \( n \), and since there are finitely many terms, the entire expression converges to 36. Therefore, \( k = 4 \).

But I want to be absolutely thorough here. Let me consider another approach. The function \( f(x) \) can be written as \( x \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). Let&#x27;s substitute \( t = \frac{1}{x} \), so as \( x \to 0^+ \), \( t \to +\infty \). Then, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \). So, the limit becomes \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \).

Now, for each \( n \), \( \lfloor n t \rfloor = n t - \{ n t \} \), where \( 0 \leq \{ n t \} &lt; 1 \). Therefore, \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \frac{1}{t} \left( \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \right ) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n - \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \).

As \( t \to \infty \), the term \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) goes to 0 because each \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, so the sum is bounded between 0 and 8, and dividing by \( t \) (which is going to infinity) gives 0. Therefore, the limit is \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Hence, again, the same conclusion: \( k = 4 \).

Alternatively, one might wonder if there&#x27;s a more complex behavior due to the interaction between different terms. For example, if the fractional parts \( \{ n t \} \) are not independent, maybe their sum fluctuates in a way that doesn&#x27;t vanish when divided by \( t \). However, since each term \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, the entire sum \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 8. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and \( \frac{8}{t} \), which clearly approaches 0 as \( t \to \infty \). Hence, the limit is indeed 36.

Just to be thorough, let&#x27;s consider the left-hand limit as \( x \to 0^- \). But since \( x \) approaches 0 from the left, \( x \) is negative. However, the original function is defined for \( x \neq 0 \), but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, and the floor function of a negative number can behave differently. Wait, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether \( x \) is approaching 0 from the right or left. However, continuity at 0 requires that the limit exists and is equal from both sides. But since \( x = 0 \) is approached from both sides, we need to check both.

Wait, but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to a negative number. For example, if \( \frac{n}{x} = -1.2 \), then \( \lfloor -1.2 \rfloor = -2 \). However, in that case, multiplying \( x \) (which is negative) by \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) (which is also negative) gives a positive product. But in the original problem, when \( x \) is positive (approaching 0 from the right), each term is positive. However, when approaching from the left, \( x \) is negative, and \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is negative, so their product is positive as well. Therefore, perhaps the function \( f(x) \) is positive in both cases.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. For \( x \to 0^- \), \( x \) is negative. Let me compute \( f(x) = x \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \). Since \( x \) is negative, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative. The floor of a negative number is more negative. For example, \( \lfloor -1.5 \rfloor = -2 \). So, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \leq \frac{n}{x} \), but since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, the floor function makes it even more negative. Then, multiplying by \( x \), which is also negative, gives a positive product. Let&#x27;s take an example. Suppose \( x = -0.1 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = -10 \), \( \lfloor -10 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} = -20 \), \( \lfloor -20 \rfloor = -20 \), and so on. So, each term \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n}{x} \) since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer here. Therefore, multiplying by \( x \), we have \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} = n \). Therefore, even for negative \( x \), if \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer, then \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n \), just like in the positive case. Therefore, the sum would again be \( 36 \).

But if \( x \) is negative and \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer, for example, \( x = -0.1 + \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon \) is a small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is slightly less negative than \( -10n \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = -10n - 1 \). Wait, let&#x27;s compute it. Let me take \( x = -0.11 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} \approx -18.1818 \), so \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \). Wait, but here, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is actually one less than the integer part if we look at the magnitude. For example, \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \), since -10 is the greatest integer less than or equal to -9.0909. Similarly, \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \).

Therefore, for \( x = -0.11 \), the term \( x \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \rfloor = (-0.11)(-10) = 1.1 \), but \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so the floor is -10, multiplied by x gives 1.1. However, the actual value of \( \frac{1}{x} \) is approximately -9.0909, so if we take the floor and multiply by x, we get a value slightly larger than 1. Wait, but when x is negative, is this value approaching the same limit?

Wait, let&#x27;s generalize. Let me consider \( x \to 0^- \). Let \( x = -t \), where \( t \to 0^+ \). Then, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \). Now, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \) is equal to \( -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), where \( \lceil y \rceil \) is the ceiling function. Alternatively, for any real number \( y \), \( \lfloor -y \rfloor = -\lceil y \rceil \). Therefore, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor = -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \).

Therefore, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \). Now, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{n}{t} \). Let \( \frac{n}{t} = m + \delta \), where \( m \) is a non-negative integer and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = m + 1 \) if \( \delta &gt; 0 \), otherwise \( m \) if \( \delta = 0 \). Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is not an integer, otherwise \( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \).

Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 - \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \), where \( \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \) is 1 if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer, 0 otherwise. However, for \( t \) approaching 0, the likelihood that \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer becomes negligible unless \( t \) is chosen specifically. So, generically, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \), except on a set of measure zero.

Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 ( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 ) \), except possibly when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer. Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0^+ \), the term \( 8 t \to 0 \). The first term \( t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) is similar to the original problem but approaching from the positive side. As established before, each \( t \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \to n \), so the sum approaches 36. Therefore, \( f(x) = 36 + 0 = 36 \).

However, this seems contradictory because when approaching from the negative side, we have an extra term \( 8t \), but in the limit as \( t \to 0 \), that term disappears. Therefore, both left and right limits are 36. Therefore, the function is continuous at 0 if \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But wait, when approaching from the negative side, we had \( f(x) = t \sum \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), and \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) (except when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer). Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum (\lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1) \). But \( \sum_{n=1}^8 1 = 8 \), so \( f(x) = t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0 \), \( t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) approaches 36 and \( 8 t \to 0 \). Therefore, the left-hand limit is also 36. Thus, the two-sided limit is 36, and therefore, \( k = 4 \).

Therefore, after carefully considering both right and left limits, as well as different ways \( x \) can approach 0, I conclude that the limit is indeed 36, so \( k = 4 \).

**Final Answer**
The value of \( k \) is \boxed{4}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \), we need to compute the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 and set it equal to \( f(0) = 9k \).

The function \( f(x) \) for \( x \neq 0 \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right)
\]

We analyze each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \). For each \( n \), as \( x \to 0 \), \( \frac{n}{x} \) becomes very large. The floor function \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying by \( x \) gives:
\[
x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor = x \left( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) = n - x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\}
\]

As \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) approaches 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is bounded between 0 and 1. Therefore, each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Summing these terms from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), we get:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^8 x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \to \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36
\]

Thus, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36. For continuity at \( x = 0 \), we set \( 9k = 36 \), leading to \( k = 4 \).

Verification for both left and right limits confirms that the limit is indeed 36, regardless of the direction from which \( x \) approaches 0. Therefore, the value of \( k \) is \(\boxed{4}\).          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \). The function is defined as \( f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right) \) for \( x \neq 0 \), and \( f(0) = 9k \). For continuity at \( x = 0 \), the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 should equal \( f(0) \), so I need to compute \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) \) and set it equal to \( 9k \), then solve for \( k \).

First, let me recall that the greatest integer function \( \lfloor y \rfloor \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( y \). So, for each term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) where \( n \) ranges from 1 to 8, as \( x \) approaches 0, \( \frac{n}{x } \) becomes very large. Therefore, each floor function term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately equal to \( \frac{n}{x} \) minus some fractional part. But since we&#x27;re multiplying by \( x \), perhaps those fractional parts become negligible when multiplied by \( x \), especially in the limit as \( x \to 0 \).

Let me test this idea. Let&#x27;s consider a single term first: \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). If \( x \) is approaching 0, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is approaching infinity. The floor of \( \frac{n}{x} \) is \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying this by \( x \), we get \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} = n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \).

Now, as \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) should approach 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is between 0 and 1, so multiplying by \( x \) gives something between 0 and \( x \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the limit of \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \) is \( n \). 

If this is the case for each term from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), then the entire sum inside the function \( f(x) \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \), and multiplying by \( x \) gives \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left( n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) \). Therefore, the limit as \( x \to 0 \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36 \). Hence, \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = 36 \), so setting \( 9k = 36 \), we get \( k = 4 \).

But wait, is this too straightforward? Let me check again. The problem is that even though each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \), maybe there&#x27;s a cumulative effect when summing all these terms. However, since each term individually tends to \( n \), and there are finitely many terms (8 terms), the sum should approach the sum of the limits, which is 36. Therefore, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36, so \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But let me try to verify this more carefully. Let&#x27;s take a specific example. Let&#x27;s pick \( x = 1/m \) where \( m \) is a positive integer going to infinity (since \( x \to 0 \) corresponds to \( m \to \infty \)). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n m \), which is an integer, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n m \). Therefore, multiplying by \( x = 1/m \), we get exactly \( n \). So in this case, \( f(1/m) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Therefore, along this sequence \( x = 1/m \), the limit is indeed 36.

However, what if \( x \) approaches 0 in a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer? Let&#x27;s suppose \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), where \( 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n(m + \theta) \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor n m + n \theta \rfloor = n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \). Then, multiplying by \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), we get:

\( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} = \frac{n m}{m + \theta} + \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \).

As \( m \to \infty \), the first term \( \frac{n m}{m + \theta} \approx n \cdot \frac{m}{m} = n \), and the second term \( \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \approx 0 \), since \( \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \) is bounded by \( n \theta &lt; n \). Therefore, even in this case, the limit as \( m \to \infty \) (i.e., \( x \to 0 \)) is \( n \). Therefore, regardless of how \( x \) approaches 0, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \), so the sum approaches 36. Thus, \( k = 4 \).

But let&#x27;s do a concrete numerical example. Suppose \( x = 0.0001 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = 10000 \), so \( \lfloor 1/x \rfloor = 10000 \), \( \lfloor 2/x \rfloor = 20000 \), up to \( \lfloor 8/x \rfloor = 80000 \). Then, the sum is \( 10000 + 20000 + \cdots + 80000 = 10000(1 + 2 + \cdots + 8) = 10000 \cdot 36 = 360000 \). Multiplying by \( x = 0.0001 \) gives \( 360000 \cdot 0.0001 = 36 \). So indeed, for such a small \( x \), \( f(x) = 36 \), which is exactly the value we need for continuity. Therefore, \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

Wait, but perhaps there&#x27;s a subtlety here. Suppose instead of taking \( x = 1/m \), we take \( x \) approaching 0 in such a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer. Let&#x27;s take \( x = \epsilon \), a very small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is some large number, say \( N + \delta \), where \( N = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = x N \). But \( \frac{n}{x} = N + \delta \implies x = \frac{n}{N + \delta} \). Therefore, \( x N = \frac{n N}{N + \delta} = n \cdot \frac{N}{N + \delta} \). As \( x \to 0 \), \( N \to \infty \), so \( \frac{N}{N + \delta} \to 1 \). Therefore, \( x N \to n \). Hence, even in this case, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Therefore, regardless of the path \( x \to 0 \), each term in the sum converges to \( n \), and since there are finitely many terms, the entire expression converges to 36. Therefore, \( k = 4 \).

But I want to be absolutely thorough here. Let me consider another approach. The function \( f(x) \) can be written as \( x \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). Let&#x27;s substitute \( t = \frac{1}{x} \), so as \( x \to 0^+ \), \( t \to +\infty \). Then, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \). So, the limit becomes \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \).

Now, for each \( n \), \( \lfloor n t \rfloor = n t - \{ n t \} \), where \( 0 \leq \{ n t \} &lt; 1 \). Therefore, \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \frac{1}{t} \left( \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \right ) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n - \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \).

As \( t \to \infty \), the term \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) goes to 0 because each \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, so the sum is bounded between 0 and 8, and dividing by \( t \) (which is going to infinity) gives 0. Therefore, the limit is \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Hence, again, the same conclusion: \( k = 4 \).

Alternatively, one might wonder if there&#x27;s a more complex behavior due to the interaction between different terms. For example, if the fractional parts \( \{ n t \} \) are not independent, maybe their sum fluctuates in a way that doesn&#x27;t vanish when divided by \( t \). However, since each term \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, the entire sum \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 8. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and \( \frac{8}{t} \), which clearly approaches 0 as \( t \to \infty \). Hence, the limit is indeed 36.

Just to be thorough, let&#x27;s consider the left-hand limit as \( x \to 0^- \). But since \( x \) approaches 0 from the left, \( x \) is negative. However, the original function is defined for \( x \neq 0 \), but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, and the floor function of a negative number can behave differently. Wait, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether \( x \) is approaching 0 from the right or left. However, continuity at 0 requires that the limit exists and is equal from both sides. But since \( x = 0 \) is approached from both sides, we need to check both.

Wait, but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to a negative number. For example, if \( \frac{n}{x} = -1.2 \), then \( \lfloor -1.2 \rfloor = -2 \). However, in that case, multiplying \( x \) (which is negative) by \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) (which is also negative) gives a positive product. But in the original problem, when \( x \) is positive (approaching 0 from the right), each term is positive. However, when approaching from the left, \( x \) is negative, and \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is negative, so their product is positive as well. Therefore, perhaps the function \( f(x) \) is positive in both cases.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. For \( x \to 0^- \), \( x \) is negative. Let me compute \( f(x) = x \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \). Since \( x \) is negative, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative. The floor of a negative number is more negative. For example, \( \lfloor -1.5 \rfloor = -2 \). So, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \leq \frac{n}{x} \), but since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, the floor function makes it even more negative. Then, multiplying by \( x \), which is also negative, gives a positive product. Let&#x27;s take an example. Suppose \( x = -0.1 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = -10 \), \( \lfloor -10 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} = -20 \), \( \lfloor -20 \rfloor = -20 \), and so on. So, each term \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n}{x} \) since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer here. Therefore, multiplying by \( x \), we have \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} = n \). Therefore, even for negative \( x \), if \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer, then \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n \), just like in the positive case. Therefore, the sum would again be \( 36 \).

But if \( x \) is negative and \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer, for example, \( x = -0.1 + \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon \) is a small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is slightly less negative than \( -10n \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = -10n - 1 \). Wait, let&#x27;s compute it. Let me take \( x = -0.11 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} \approx -18.1818 \), so \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \). Wait, but here, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is actually one less than the integer part if we look at the magnitude. For example, \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \), since -10 is the greatest integer less than or equal to -9.0909. Similarly, \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \).

Therefore, for \( x = -0.11 \), the term \( x \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \rfloor = (-0.11)(-10) = 1.1 \), but \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so the floor is -10, multiplied by x gives 1.1. However, the actual value of \( \frac{1}{x} \) is approximately -9.0909, so if we take the floor and multiply by x, we get a value slightly larger than 1. Wait, but when x is negative, is this value approaching the same limit?

Wait, let&#x27;s generalize. Let me consider \( x \to 0^- \). Let \( x = -t \), where \( t \to 0^+ \). Then, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \). Now, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \) is equal to \( -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), where \( \lceil y \rceil \) is the ceiling function. Alternatively, for any real number \( y \), \( \lfloor -y \rfloor = -\lceil y \rceil \). Therefore, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor = -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \).

Therefore, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \). Now, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{n}{t} \). Let \( \frac{n}{t} = m + \delta \), where \( m \) is a non-negative integer and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = m + 1 \) if \( \delta &gt; 0 \), otherwise \( m \) if \( \delta = 0 \). Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is not an integer, otherwise \( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \).

Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 - \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \), where \( \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \) is 1 if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer, 0 otherwise. However, for \( t \) approaching 0, the likelihood that \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer becomes negligible unless \( t \) is chosen specifically. So, generically, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \), except on a set of measure zero.

Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 ( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 ) \), except possibly when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer. Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0^+ \), the term \( 8 t \to 0 \). The first term \( t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) is similar to the original problem but approaching from the positive side. As established before, each \( t \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \to n \), so the sum approaches 36. Therefore, \( f(x) = 36 + 0 = 36 \).

However, this seems contradictory because when approaching from the negative side, we have an extra term \( 8t \), but in the limit as \( t \to 0 \), that term disappears. Therefore, both left and right limits are 36. Therefore, the function is continuous at 0 if \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But wait, when approaching from the negative side, we had \( f(x) = t \sum \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), and \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) (except when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer). Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum (\lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1) \). But \( \sum_{n=1}^8 1 = 8 \), so \( f(x) = t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0 \), \( t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) approaches 36 and \( 8 t \to 0 \). Therefore, the left-hand limit is also 36. Thus, the two-sided limit is 36, and therefore, \( k = 4 \).

Therefore, after carefully considering both right and left limits, as well as different ways \( x \) can approach 0, I conclude that the limit is indeed 36, so \( k = 4 \).

**Final Answer**
The value of \( k \) is \boxed{4}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \), we need to compute the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 and set it equal to \( f(0) = 9k \).

The function \( f(x) \) for \( x \neq 0 \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right)
\]

We analyze each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \). For each \( n \), as \( x \to 0 \), \( \frac{n}{x} \) becomes very large. The floor function \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying by \( x \) gives:
\[
x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor = x \left( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) = n - x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\}
\]

As \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) approaches 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is bounded between 0 and 1. Therefore, each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Summing these terms from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), we get:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^8 x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \to \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36
\]

Thus, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36. For continuity at \( x = 0 \), we set \( 9k = 36 \), leading to \( k = 4 \).

Verification for both left and right limits confirms that the limit is indeed 36, regardless of the direction from which \( x \) approaches 0. Therefore, the value of \( k \) is \(\boxed{4}\).          </p>

The function is defined as \( f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right) \) for \( x \neq 0 \), and \( f(0) = 9k \). For continuity at \( x = 0 \), the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 should equal \( f(0) \), so I need to compute \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) \) and set it equal to \( 9k \), then solve for \( k \).

First, let me recall that the greatest integer function \( \lfloor y \rfloor \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( y \). So, for each term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) where \( n \) ranges from 1 to 8, as \( x \) approaches 0, \( \frac{n}{x } \) becomes very large. Therefore, each floor function term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately equal to \( \frac{n}{x} \) minus some fractional part. But since we&#x27;re multiplying by \( x \), perhaps those fractional parts become negligible when multiplied by \( x \), especially in the limit as \( x \to 0 \).

Let me test this idea. Let&#x27;s consider a single term first: \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). If \( x \) is approaching 0, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is approaching infinity. The floor of \( \frac{n}{x} \) is \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying this by \( x \), we get \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} = n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \).

Now, as \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) should approach 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is between 0 and 1, so multiplying by \( x \) gives something between 0 and \( x \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the limit of \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \) is \( n \). 

If this is the case for each term from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), then the entire sum inside the function \( f(x) \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \), and multiplying by \( x \) gives \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left( n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) \). Therefore, the limit as \( x \to 0 \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36 \). Hence, \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = 36 \), so setting \( 9k = 36 \), we get \( k = 4 \).

But wait, is this too straightforward? Let me check again. The problem is that even though each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \), maybe there&#x27;s a cumulative effect when summing all these terms. However, since each term individually tends to \( n \), and there are finitely many terms (8 terms), the sum should approach the sum of the limits, which is 36. Therefore, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36, so \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But let me try to verify this more carefully. Let&#x27;s take a specific example. Let&#x27;s pick \( x = 1/m \) where \( m \) is a positive integer going to infinity (since \( x \to 0 \) corresponds to \( m \to \infty \)). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n m \), which is an integer, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n m \). Therefore, multiplying by \( x = 1/m \), we get exactly \( n \). So in this case, \( f(1/m) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Therefore, along this sequence \( x = 1/m \), the limit is indeed 36.

However, what if \( x \) approaches 0 in a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer? Let&#x27;s suppose \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), where \( 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n(m + \theta) \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor n m + n \theta \rfloor = n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \). Then, multiplying by \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), we get:

\( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} = \frac{n m}{m + \theta} + \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \).

As \( m \to \infty \), the first term \( \frac{n m}{m + \theta} \approx n \cdot \frac{m}{m} = n \), and the second term \( \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \approx 0 \), since \( \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \) is bounded by \( n \theta &lt; n \). Therefore, even in this case, the limit as \( m \to \infty \) (i.e., \( x \to 0 \)) is \( n \). Therefore, regardless of how \( x \) approaches 0, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \), so the sum approaches 36. Thus, \( k = 4 \).

But let&#x27;s do a concrete numerical example. Suppose \( x = 0.0001 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = 10000 \), so \( \lfloor 1/x \rfloor = 10000 \), \( \lfloor 2/x \rfloor = 20000 \), up to \( \lfloor 8/x \rfloor = 80000 \). Then, the sum is \( 10000 + 20000 + \cdots + 80000 = 10000(1 + 2 + \cdots + 8) = 10000 \cdot 36 = 360000 \). Multiplying by \( x = 0.0001 \) gives \( 360000 \cdot 0.0001 = 36 \). So indeed, for such a small \( x \), \( f(x) = 36 \), which is exactly the value we need for continuity. Therefore, \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

Wait, but perhaps there&#x27;s a subtlety here. Suppose instead of taking \( x = 1/m \), we take \( x \) approaching 0 in such a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer. Let&#x27;s take \( x = \epsilon \), a very small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is some large number, say \( N + \delta \), where \( N = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = x N \). But \( \frac{n}{x} = N + \delta \implies x = \frac{n}{N + \delta} \). Therefore, \( x N = \frac{n N}{N + \delta} = n \cdot \frac{N}{N + \delta} \). As \( x \to 0 \), \( N \to \infty \), so \( \frac{N}{N + \delta} \to 1 \). Therefore, \( x N \to n \). Hence, even in this case, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Therefore, regardless of the path \( x \to 0 \), each term in the sum converges to \( n \), and since there are finitely many terms, the entire expression converges to 36. Therefore, \( k = 4 \).

But I want to be absolutely thorough here. Let me consider another approach. The function \( f(x) \) can be written as \( x \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). Let&#x27;s substitute \( t = \frac{1}{x} \), so as \( x \to 0^+ \), \( t \to +\infty \). Then, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \). So, the limit becomes \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \).

Now, for each \( n \), \( \lfloor n t \rfloor = n t - \{ n t \} \), where \( 0 \leq \{ n t \} &lt; 1 \). Therefore, \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \frac{1}{t} \left( \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \right ) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n - \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \).

As \( t \to \infty \), the term \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) goes to 0 because each \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, so the sum is bounded between 0 and 8, and dividing by \( t \) (which is going to infinity) gives 0. Therefore, the limit is \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Hence, again, the same conclusion: \( k = 4 \).

Alternatively, one might wonder if there&#x27;s a more complex behavior due to the interaction between different terms. For example, if the fractional parts \( \{ n t \} \) are not independent, maybe their sum fluctuates in a way that doesn&#x27;t vanish when divided by \( t \). However, since each term \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, the entire sum \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 8. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and \( \frac{8}{t} \), which clearly approaches 0 as \( t \to \infty \). Hence, the limit is indeed 36.

Just to be thorough, let&#x27;s consider the left-hand limit as \( x \to 0^- \). But since \( x \) approaches 0 from the left, \( x \) is negative. However, the original function is defined for \( x \neq 0 \), but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, and the floor function of a negative number can behave differently. Wait, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether \( x \) is approaching 0 from the right or left. However, continuity at 0 requires that the limit exists and is equal from both sides. But since \( x = 0 \) is approached from both sides, we need to check both.

Wait, but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to a negative number. For example, if \( \frac{n}{x} = -1.2 \), then \( \lfloor -1.2 \rfloor = -2 \). However, in that case, multiplying \( x \) (which is negative) by \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) (which is also negative) gives a positive product. But in the original problem, when \( x \) is positive (approaching 0 from the right), each term is positive. However, when approaching from the left, \( x \) is negative, and \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is negative, so their product is positive as well. Therefore, perhaps the function \( f(x) \) is positive in both cases.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. For \( x \to 0^- \), \( x \) is negative. Let me compute \( f(x) = x \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \). Since \( x \) is negative, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative. The floor of a negative number is more negative. For example, \( \lfloor -1.5 \rfloor = -2 \). So, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \leq \frac{n}{x} \), but since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, the floor function makes it even more negative. Then, multiplying by \( x \), which is also negative, gives a positive product. Let&#x27;s take an example. Suppose \( x = -0.1 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = -10 \), \( \lfloor -10 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} = -20 \), \( \lfloor -20 \rfloor = -20 \), and so on. So, each term \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n}{x} \) since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer here. Therefore, multiplying by \( x \), we have \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} = n \). Therefore, even for negative \( x \), if \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer, then \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n \), just like in the positive case. Therefore, the sum would again be \( 36 \).

But if \( x \) is negative and \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer, for example, \( x = -0.1 + \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon \) is a small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is slightly less negative than \( -10n \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = -10n - 1 \). Wait, let&#x27;s compute it. Let me take \( x = -0.11 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} \approx -18.1818 \), so \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \). Wait, but here, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is actually one less than the integer part if we look at the magnitude. For example, \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \), since -10 is the greatest integer less than or equal to -9.0909. Similarly, \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \).

Therefore, for \( x = -0.11 \), the term \( x \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \rfloor = (-0.11)(-10) = 1.1 \), but \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so the floor is -10, multiplied by x gives 1.1. However, the actual value of \( \frac{1}{x} \) is approximately -9.0909, so if we take the floor and multiply by x, we get a value slightly larger than 1. Wait, but when x is negative, is this value approaching the same limit?

Wait, let&#x27;s generalize. Let me consider \( x \to 0^- \). Let \( x = -t \), where \( t \to 0^+ \). Then, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \). Now, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \) is equal to \( -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), where \( \lceil y \rceil \) is the ceiling function. Alternatively, for any real number \( y \), \( \lfloor -y \rfloor = -\lceil y \rceil \). Therefore, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor = -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \).

Therefore, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \). Now, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{n}{t} \). Let \( \frac{n}{t} = m + \delta \), where \( m \) is a non-negative integer and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = m + 1 \) if \( \delta &gt; 0 \), otherwise \( m \) if \( \delta = 0 \). Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is not an integer, otherwise \( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \).

Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 - \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \), where \( \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \) is 1 if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer, 0 otherwise. However, for \( t \) approaching 0, the likelihood that \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer becomes negligible unless \( t \) is chosen specifically. So, generically, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \), except on a set of measure zero.

Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 ( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 ) \), except possibly when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer. Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0^+ \), the term \( 8 t \to 0 \). The first term \( t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) is similar to the original problem but approaching from the positive side. As established before, each \( t \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \to n \), so the sum approaches 36. Therefore, \( f(x) = 36 + 0 = 36 \).

However, this seems contradictory because when approaching from the negative side, we have an extra term \( 8t \), but in the limit as \( t \to 0 \), that term disappears. Therefore, both left and right limits are 36. Therefore, the function is continuous at 0 if \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But wait, when approaching from the negative side, we had \( f(x) = t \sum \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), and \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) (except when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer). Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum (\lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1) \). But \( \sum_{n=1}^8 1 = 8 \), so \( f(x) = t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0 \), \( t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) approaches 36 and \( 8 t \to 0 \). Therefore, the left-hand limit is also 36. Thus, the two-sided limit is 36, and therefore, \( k = 4 \).

Therefore, after carefully considering both right and left limits, as well as different ways \( x \) can approach 0, I conclude that the limit is indeed 36, so \( k = 4 \).

**Final Answer**
The value of \( k \) is \boxed{4}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \), we need to compute the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 and set it equal to \( f(0) = 9k \).

The function \( f(x) \) for \( x \neq 0 \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right)
\]

We analyze each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \). For each \( n \), as \( x \to 0 \), \( \frac{n}{x} \) becomes very large. The floor function \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying by \( x \) gives:
\[
x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor = x \left( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) = n - x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\}
\]

As \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) approaches 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is bounded between 0 and 1. Therefore, each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Summing these terms from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), we get:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^8 x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \to \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36
\]

Thus, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36. For continuity at \( x = 0 \), we set \( 9k = 36 \), leading to \( k = 4 \).

Verification for both left and right limits confirms that the limit is indeed 36, regardless of the direction from which \( x \) approaches 0. Therefore, the value of \( k \) is \(\boxed{4}\).          </p>

For continuity at \( x = 0 \), the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 should equal \( f(0) \), so I need to compute \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) \) and set it equal to \( 9k \), then solve for \( k \).

First, let me recall that the greatest integer function \( \lfloor y \rfloor \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( y \). So, for each term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) where \( n \) ranges from 1 to 8, as \( x \) approaches 0, \( \frac{n}{x } \) becomes very large. Therefore, each floor function term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately equal to \( \frac{n}{x} \) minus some fractional part. But since we&#x27;re multiplying by \( x \), perhaps those fractional parts become negligible when multiplied by \( x \), especially in the limit as \( x \to 0 \).

Let me test this idea. Let&#x27;s consider a single term first: \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). If \( x \) is approaching 0, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is approaching infinity. The floor of \( \frac{n}{x} \) is \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying this by \( x \), we get \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} = n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \).

Now, as \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) should approach 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is between 0 and 1, so multiplying by \( x \) gives something between 0 and \( x \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the limit of \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \) is \( n \). 

If this is the case for each term from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), then the entire sum inside the function \( f(x) \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \), and multiplying by \( x \) gives \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left( n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) \). Therefore, the limit as \( x \to 0 \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36 \). Hence, \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = 36 \), so setting \( 9k = 36 \), we get \( k = 4 \).

But wait, is this too straightforward? Let me check again. The problem is that even though each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \), maybe there&#x27;s a cumulative effect when summing all these terms. However, since each term individually tends to \( n \), and there are finitely many terms (8 terms), the sum should approach the sum of the limits, which is 36. Therefore, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36, so \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But let me try to verify this more carefully. Let&#x27;s take a specific example. Let&#x27;s pick \( x = 1/m \) where \( m \) is a positive integer going to infinity (since \( x \to 0 \) corresponds to \( m \to \infty \)). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n m \), which is an integer, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n m \). Therefore, multiplying by \( x = 1/m \), we get exactly \( n \). So in this case, \( f(1/m) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Therefore, along this sequence \( x = 1/m \), the limit is indeed 36.

However, what if \( x \) approaches 0 in a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer? Let&#x27;s suppose \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), where \( 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n(m + \theta) \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor n m + n \theta \rfloor = n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \). Then, multiplying by \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), we get:

\( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} = \frac{n m}{m + \theta} + \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \).

As \( m \to \infty \), the first term \( \frac{n m}{m + \theta} \approx n \cdot \frac{m}{m} = n \), and the second term \( \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \approx 0 \), since \( \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \) is bounded by \( n \theta &lt; n \). Therefore, even in this case, the limit as \( m \to \infty \) (i.e., \( x \to 0 \)) is \( n \). Therefore, regardless of how \( x \) approaches 0, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \), so the sum approaches 36. Thus, \( k = 4 \).

But let&#x27;s do a concrete numerical example. Suppose \( x = 0.0001 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = 10000 \), so \( \lfloor 1/x \rfloor = 10000 \), \( \lfloor 2/x \rfloor = 20000 \), up to \( \lfloor 8/x \rfloor = 80000 \). Then, the sum is \( 10000 + 20000 + \cdots + 80000 = 10000(1 + 2 + \cdots + 8) = 10000 \cdot 36 = 360000 \). Multiplying by \( x = 0.0001 \) gives \( 360000 \cdot 0.0001 = 36 \). So indeed, for such a small \( x \), \( f(x) = 36 \), which is exactly the value we need for continuity. Therefore, \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

Wait, but perhaps there&#x27;s a subtlety here. Suppose instead of taking \( x = 1/m \), we take \( x \) approaching 0 in such a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer. Let&#x27;s take \( x = \epsilon \), a very small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is some large number, say \( N + \delta \), where \( N = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = x N \). But \( \frac{n}{x} = N + \delta \implies x = \frac{n}{N + \delta} \). Therefore, \( x N = \frac{n N}{N + \delta} = n \cdot \frac{N}{N + \delta} \). As \( x \to 0 \), \( N \to \infty \), so \( \frac{N}{N + \delta} \to 1 \). Therefore, \( x N \to n \). Hence, even in this case, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Therefore, regardless of the path \( x \to 0 \), each term in the sum converges to \( n \), and since there are finitely many terms, the entire expression converges to 36. Therefore, \( k = 4 \).

But I want to be absolutely thorough here. Let me consider another approach. The function \( f(x) \) can be written as \( x \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). Let&#x27;s substitute \( t = \frac{1}{x} \), so as \( x \to 0^+ \), \( t \to +\infty \). Then, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \). So, the limit becomes \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \).

Now, for each \( n \), \( \lfloor n t \rfloor = n t - \{ n t \} \), where \( 0 \leq \{ n t \} &lt; 1 \). Therefore, \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \frac{1}{t} \left( \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \right ) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n - \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \).

As \( t \to \infty \), the term \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) goes to 0 because each \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, so the sum is bounded between 0 and 8, and dividing by \( t \) (which is going to infinity) gives 0. Therefore, the limit is \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Hence, again, the same conclusion: \( k = 4 \).

Alternatively, one might wonder if there&#x27;s a more complex behavior due to the interaction between different terms. For example, if the fractional parts \( \{ n t \} \) are not independent, maybe their sum fluctuates in a way that doesn&#x27;t vanish when divided by \( t \). However, since each term \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, the entire sum \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 8. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and \( \frac{8}{t} \), which clearly approaches 0 as \( t \to \infty \). Hence, the limit is indeed 36.

Just to be thorough, let&#x27;s consider the left-hand limit as \( x \to 0^- \). But since \( x \) approaches 0 from the left, \( x \) is negative. However, the original function is defined for \( x \neq 0 \), but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, and the floor function of a negative number can behave differently. Wait, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether \( x \) is approaching 0 from the right or left. However, continuity at 0 requires that the limit exists and is equal from both sides. But since \( x = 0 \) is approached from both sides, we need to check both.

Wait, but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to a negative number. For example, if \( \frac{n}{x} = -1.2 \), then \( \lfloor -1.2 \rfloor = -2 \). However, in that case, multiplying \( x \) (which is negative) by \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) (which is also negative) gives a positive product. But in the original problem, when \( x \) is positive (approaching 0 from the right), each term is positive. However, when approaching from the left, \( x \) is negative, and \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is negative, so their product is positive as well. Therefore, perhaps the function \( f(x) \) is positive in both cases.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. For \( x \to 0^- \), \( x \) is negative. Let me compute \( f(x) = x \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \). Since \( x \) is negative, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative. The floor of a negative number is more negative. For example, \( \lfloor -1.5 \rfloor = -2 \). So, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \leq \frac{n}{x} \), but since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, the floor function makes it even more negative. Then, multiplying by \( x \), which is also negative, gives a positive product. Let&#x27;s take an example. Suppose \( x = -0.1 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = -10 \), \( \lfloor -10 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} = -20 \), \( \lfloor -20 \rfloor = -20 \), and so on. So, each term \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n}{x} \) since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer here. Therefore, multiplying by \( x \), we have \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} = n \). Therefore, even for negative \( x \), if \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer, then \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n \), just like in the positive case. Therefore, the sum would again be \( 36 \).

But if \( x \) is negative and \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer, for example, \( x = -0.1 + \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon \) is a small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is slightly less negative than \( -10n \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = -10n - 1 \). Wait, let&#x27;s compute it. Let me take \( x = -0.11 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} \approx -18.1818 \), so \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \). Wait, but here, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is actually one less than the integer part if we look at the magnitude. For example, \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \), since -10 is the greatest integer less than or equal to -9.0909. Similarly, \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \).

Therefore, for \( x = -0.11 \), the term \( x \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \rfloor = (-0.11)(-10) = 1.1 \), but \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so the floor is -10, multiplied by x gives 1.1. However, the actual value of \( \frac{1}{x} \) is approximately -9.0909, so if we take the floor and multiply by x, we get a value slightly larger than 1. Wait, but when x is negative, is this value approaching the same limit?

Wait, let&#x27;s generalize. Let me consider \( x \to 0^- \). Let \( x = -t \), where \( t \to 0^+ \). Then, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \). Now, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \) is equal to \( -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), where \( \lceil y \rceil \) is the ceiling function. Alternatively, for any real number \( y \), \( \lfloor -y \rfloor = -\lceil y \rceil \). Therefore, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor = -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \).

Therefore, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \). Now, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{n}{t} \). Let \( \frac{n}{t} = m + \delta \), where \( m \) is a non-negative integer and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = m + 1 \) if \( \delta &gt; 0 \), otherwise \( m \) if \( \delta = 0 \). Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is not an integer, otherwise \( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \).

Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 - \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \), where \( \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \) is 1 if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer, 0 otherwise. However, for \( t \) approaching 0, the likelihood that \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer becomes negligible unless \( t \) is chosen specifically. So, generically, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \), except on a set of measure zero.

Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 ( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 ) \), except possibly when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer. Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0^+ \), the term \( 8 t \to 0 \). The first term \( t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) is similar to the original problem but approaching from the positive side. As established before, each \( t \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \to n \), so the sum approaches 36. Therefore, \( f(x) = 36 + 0 = 36 \).

However, this seems contradictory because when approaching from the negative side, we have an extra term \( 8t \), but in the limit as \( t \to 0 \), that term disappears. Therefore, both left and right limits are 36. Therefore, the function is continuous at 0 if \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But wait, when approaching from the negative side, we had \( f(x) = t \sum \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), and \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) (except when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer). Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum (\lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1) \). But \( \sum_{n=1}^8 1 = 8 \), so \( f(x) = t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0 \), \( t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) approaches 36 and \( 8 t \to 0 \). Therefore, the left-hand limit is also 36. Thus, the two-sided limit is 36, and therefore, \( k = 4 \).

Therefore, after carefully considering both right and left limits, as well as different ways \( x \) can approach 0, I conclude that the limit is indeed 36, so \( k = 4 \).

**Final Answer**
The value of \( k \) is \boxed{4}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \), we need to compute the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 and set it equal to \( f(0) = 9k \).

The function \( f(x) \) for \( x \neq 0 \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right)
\]

We analyze each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \). For each \( n \), as \( x \to 0 \), \( \frac{n}{x} \) becomes very large. The floor function \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying by \( x \) gives:
\[
x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor = x \left( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) = n - x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\}
\]

As \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) approaches 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is bounded between 0 and 1. Therefore, each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Summing these terms from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), we get:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^8 x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \to \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36
\]

Thus, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36. For continuity at \( x = 0 \), we set \( 9k = 36 \), leading to \( k = 4 \).

Verification for both left and right limits confirms that the limit is indeed 36, regardless of the direction from which \( x \) approaches 0. Therefore, the value of \( k \) is \(\boxed{4}\).          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Alright, so I need to find the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \). The function is defined as \( f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right) \) for \( x \neq 0 \), and \( f(0) = 9k \). For continuity at \( x = 0 \), the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 should equal \( f(0) \), so I need to compute \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) \) and set it equal to \( 9k \), then solve for \( k \).

First, let me recall that the greatest integer function \( \lfloor y \rfloor \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( y \). So, for each term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) where \( n \) ranges from 1 to 8, as \( x \) approaches 0, \( \frac{n}{x } \) becomes very large. Therefore, each floor function term \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately equal to \( \frac{n}{x} \) minus some fractional part. But since we&#x27;re multiplying by \( x \), perhaps those fractional parts become negligible when multiplied by \( x \), especially in the limit as \( x \to 0 \).

Let me test this idea. Let&#x27;s consider a single term first: \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). If \( x \) is approaching 0, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is approaching infinity. The floor of \( \frac{n}{x} \) is \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying this by \( x \), we get \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} = n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \).

Now, as \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) should approach 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is between 0 and 1, so multiplying by \( x \) gives something between 0 and \( x \), which goes to 0. Therefore, the limit of \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \) is \( n \). 

If this is the case for each term from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), then the entire sum inside the function \( f(x) \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \), and multiplying by \( x \) gives \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \left( n - x \cdot \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) \). Therefore, the limit as \( x \to 0 \) would be \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36 \). Hence, \( \lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = 36 \), so setting \( 9k = 36 \), we get \( k = 4 \).

But wait, is this too straightforward? Let me check again. The problem is that even though each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \), maybe there&#x27;s a cumulative effect when summing all these terms. However, since each term individually tends to \( n \), and there are finitely many terms (8 terms), the sum should approach the sum of the limits, which is 36. Therefore, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36, so \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But let me try to verify this more carefully. Let&#x27;s take a specific example. Let&#x27;s pick \( x = 1/m \) where \( m \) is a positive integer going to infinity (since \( x \to 0 \) corresponds to \( m \to \infty \)). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n m \), which is an integer, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n m \). Therefore, multiplying by \( x = 1/m \), we get exactly \( n \). So in this case, \( f(1/m) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Therefore, along this sequence \( x = 1/m \), the limit is indeed 36.

However, what if \( x \) approaches 0 in a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer? Let&#x27;s suppose \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), where \( 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \frac{n}{x} = n(m + \theta) \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor n m + n \theta \rfloor = n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \). Then, multiplying by \( x = \frac{1}{m + \theta} \), we get:

\( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n m + \lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} = \frac{n m}{m + \theta} + \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \).

As \( m \to \infty \), the first term \( \frac{n m}{m + \theta} \approx n \cdot \frac{m}{m} = n \), and the second term \( \frac{\lfloor n \theta \rfloor}{m + \theta} \approx 0 \), since \( \lfloor n \theta \rfloor \) is bounded by \( n \theta &lt; n \). Therefore, even in this case, the limit as \( m \to \infty \) (i.e., \( x \to 0 \)) is \( n \). Therefore, regardless of how \( x \) approaches 0, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \), so the sum approaches 36. Thus, \( k = 4 \).

But let&#x27;s do a concrete numerical example. Suppose \( x = 0.0001 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = 10000 \), so \( \lfloor 1/x \rfloor = 10000 \), \( \lfloor 2/x \rfloor = 20000 \), up to \( \lfloor 8/x \rfloor = 80000 \). Then, the sum is \( 10000 + 20000 + \cdots + 80000 = 10000(1 + 2 + \cdots + 8) = 10000 \cdot 36 = 360000 \). Multiplying by \( x = 0.0001 \) gives \( 360000 \cdot 0.0001 = 36 \). So indeed, for such a small \( x \), \( f(x) = 36 \), which is exactly the value we need for continuity. Therefore, \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

Wait, but perhaps there&#x27;s a subtlety here. Suppose instead of taking \( x = 1/m \), we take \( x \) approaching 0 in such a way that \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer. Let&#x27;s take \( x = \epsilon \), a very small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is some large number, say \( N + \delta \), where \( N = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = x N \). But \( \frac{n}{x} = N + \delta \implies x = \frac{n}{N + \delta} \). Therefore, \( x N = \frac{n N}{N + \delta} = n \cdot \frac{N}{N + \delta} \). As \( x \to 0 \), \( N \to \infty \), so \( \frac{N}{N + \delta} \to 1 \). Therefore, \( x N \to n \). Hence, even in this case, each term \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Therefore, regardless of the path \( x \to 0 \), each term in the sum converges to \( n \), and since there are finitely many terms, the entire expression converges to 36. Therefore, \( k = 4 \).

But I want to be absolutely thorough here. Let me consider another approach. The function \( f(x) \) can be written as \( x \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \). Let&#x27;s substitute \( t = \frac{1}{x} \), so as \( x \to 0^+ \), \( t \to +\infty \). Then, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \). So, the limit becomes \( \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor \).

Now, for each \( n \), \( \lfloor n t \rfloor = n t - \{ n t \} \), where \( 0 \leq \{ n t \} &lt; 1 \). Therefore, \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor n t \rfloor = \frac{1}{t} \left( \sum_{n=1}^8 n t - \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \right ) = \sum_{n=1}^8 n - \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \).

As \( t \to \infty \), the term \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) goes to 0 because each \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, so the sum is bounded between 0 and 8, and dividing by \( t \) (which is going to infinity) gives 0. Therefore, the limit is \( \sum_{n=1}^8 n = 36 \). Hence, again, the same conclusion: \( k = 4 \).

Alternatively, one might wonder if there&#x27;s a more complex behavior due to the interaction between different terms. For example, if the fractional parts \( \{ n t \} \) are not independent, maybe their sum fluctuates in a way that doesn&#x27;t vanish when divided by \( t \). However, since each term \( \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 1, the entire sum \( \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and 8. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{t} \sum_{n=1}^8 \{ n t \} \) is bounded between 0 and \( \frac{8}{t} \), which clearly approaches 0 as \( t \to \infty \). Hence, the limit is indeed 36.

Just to be thorough, let&#x27;s consider the left-hand limit as \( x \to 0^- \). But since \( x \) approaches 0 from the left, \( x \) is negative. However, the original function is defined for \( x \neq 0 \), but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, and the floor function of a negative number can behave differently. Wait, the problem statement doesn&#x27;t specify whether \( x \) is approaching 0 from the right or left. However, continuity at 0 requires that the limit exists and is equal from both sides. But since \( x = 0 \) is approached from both sides, we need to check both.

Wait, but if \( x \) is negative, then \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to a negative number. For example, if \( \frac{n}{x} = -1.2 \), then \( \lfloor -1.2 \rfloor = -2 \). However, in that case, multiplying \( x \) (which is negative) by \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) (which is also negative) gives a positive product. But in the original problem, when \( x \) is positive (approaching 0 from the right), each term is positive. However, when approaching from the left, \( x \) is negative, and \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is negative, so their product is positive as well. Therefore, perhaps the function \( f(x) \) is positive in both cases.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. For \( x \to 0^- \), \( x \) is negative. Let me compute \( f(x) = x \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \). Since \( x \) is negative, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative. The floor of a negative number is more negative. For example, \( \lfloor -1.5 \rfloor = -2 \). So, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \leq \frac{n}{x} \), but since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is negative, the floor function makes it even more negative. Then, multiplying by \( x \), which is also negative, gives a positive product. Let&#x27;s take an example. Suppose \( x = -0.1 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} = -10 \), \( \lfloor -10 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} = -20 \), \( \lfloor -20 \rfloor = -20 \), and so on. So, each term \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = \frac{n}{x} \) since \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer here. Therefore, multiplying by \( x \), we have \( x \cdot \frac{n}{x} = n \). Therefore, even for negative \( x \), if \( \frac{n}{x} \) is an integer, then \( x \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = n \), just like in the positive case. Therefore, the sum would again be \( 36 \).

But if \( x \) is negative and \( \frac{n}{x} \) is not an integer, for example, \( x = -0.1 + \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon \) is a small positive number. Then, \( \frac{n}{x} \) is slightly less negative than \( -10n \), so \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor = -10n - 1 \). Wait, let&#x27;s compute it. Let me take \( x = -0.11 \). Then, \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \). Similarly, \( \frac{2}{x} \approx -18.1818 \), so \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \). Wait, but here, \( \lfloor \frac{n}{x} \rfloor \) is actually one less than the integer part if we look at the magnitude. For example, \( \lfloor -9.0909 \rfloor = -10 \), since -10 is the greatest integer less than or equal to -9.0909. Similarly, \( \lfloor -18.1818 \rfloor = -19 \).

Therefore, for \( x = -0.11 \), the term \( x \lfloor \frac{1}{x} \rfloor = (-0.11)(-10) = 1.1 \), but \( \frac{1}{x} \approx -9.0909 \), so the floor is -10, multiplied by x gives 1.1. However, the actual value of \( \frac{1}{x} \) is approximately -9.0909, so if we take the floor and multiply by x, we get a value slightly larger than 1. Wait, but when x is negative, is this value approaching the same limit?

Wait, let&#x27;s generalize. Let me consider \( x \to 0^- \). Let \( x = -t \), where \( t \to 0^+ \). Then, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \). Now, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor \) is equal to \( -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), where \( \lceil y \rceil \) is the ceiling function. Alternatively, for any real number \( y \), \( \lfloor -y \rfloor = -\lceil y \rceil \). Therefore, \( \left\lfloor -\frac{n}{t} \right\rfloor = -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \).

Therefore, \( f(x) = -t \sum_{n=1}^8 -\lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \). Now, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{n}{t} \). Let \( \frac{n}{t} = m + \delta \), where \( m \) is a non-negative integer and \( 0 \leq \delta &lt; 1 \). Then, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = m + 1 \) if \( \delta &gt; 0 \), otherwise \( m \) if \( \delta = 0 \). Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is not an integer, otherwise \( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \).

Therefore, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 - \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \), where \( \delta_{ \frac{n}{t}, \text{integer} } \) is 1 if \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer, 0 otherwise. However, for \( t \) approaching 0, the likelihood that \( \frac{n}{t} \) is an integer becomes negligible unless \( t \) is chosen specifically. So, generically, \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \), except on a set of measure zero.

Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 ( \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 ) \), except possibly when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer. Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0^+ \), the term \( 8 t \to 0 \). The first term \( t \sum_{n=1}^8 \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) is similar to the original problem but approaching from the positive side. As established before, each \( t \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \to n \), so the sum approaches 36. Therefore, \( f(x) = 36 + 0 = 36 \).

However, this seems contradictory because when approaching from the negative side, we have an extra term \( 8t \), but in the limit as \( t \to 0 \), that term disappears. Therefore, both left and right limits are 36. Therefore, the function is continuous at 0 if \( 9k = 36 \implies k = 4 \).

But wait, when approaching from the negative side, we had \( f(x) = t \sum \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil \), and \( \lceil \frac{n}{t} \rceil = \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1 \) (except when \( \frac{n}{t} \) is integer). Therefore, \( f(x) = t \sum (\lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 1) \). But \( \sum_{n=1}^8 1 = 8 \), so \( f(x) = t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor + 8 t \). As \( t \to 0 \), \( t \sum \lfloor \frac{n}{t} \rfloor \) approaches 36 and \( 8 t \to 0 \). Therefore, the left-hand limit is also 36. Thus, the two-sided limit is 36, and therefore, \( k = 4 \).

Therefore, after carefully considering both right and left limits, as well as different ways \( x \) can approach 0, I conclude that the limit is indeed 36, so \( k = 4 \).

**Final Answer**
The value of \( k \) is \boxed{4}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the value of \( k \) such that the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \), we need to compute the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0 and set it equal to \( f(0) = 9k \).

The function \( f(x) \) for \( x \neq 0 \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = x \left( \left\lfloor \frac{1}{x} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{x} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{8}{x} \right\rfloor \right)
\]

We analyze each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) as \( x \to 0 \). For each \( n \), as \( x \to 0 \), \( \frac{n}{x} \) becomes very large. The floor function \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) is approximately \( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \), where \( \left\{ \cdot \right\} \) denotes the fractional part. Multiplying by \( x \) gives:
\[
x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor = x \left( \frac{n}{x} - \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \right) = n - x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\}
\]

As \( x \to 0 \), the term \( x \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) approaches 0 because \( \left\{ \frac{n}{x} \right\} \) is bounded between 0 and 1. Therefore, each term \( x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \) approaches \( n \).

Summing these terms from \( n = 1 \) to \( 8 \), we get:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^8 x \left\lfloor \frac{n}{x} \right\rfloor \to \sum_{n=1}^8 n = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = 36
\]

Thus, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to 0 \) is 36. For continuity at \( x = 0 \), we set \( 9k = 36 \), leading to \( k = 4 \).

Verification for both left and right limits confirms that the limit is indeed 36, regardless of the direction from which \( x \) approaches 0. Therefore, the value of \( k \) is \(\boxed{4}\).          </p>
