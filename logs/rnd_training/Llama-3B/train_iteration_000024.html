Reference Answer: Writing out the prime factors of $22$ and $48$, we see that $22 = 2 \cdot 11$ and $48 = 16 \cdot 3 = 2^4 \cdot 3$. Since $11$ does not divide $48$ and $3$ does not divide $22$, it follows that the greatest common factor of $22$ and $48$ is $2$.

The least common multiple, on the other hand, must account for the prime factors of both $22$ and $48$. The highest power of $2$ present in either term is $2^4 = 16$, of $3$ is $3^1 = 3$, and of $11$ is $11^1 = 11$. Thus, the LCM will be $2^4 \cdot 3 \cdot 11 = 528$. The product of the greatest common factor and the least common multiple is thus $2 \cdot 528 = \boxed{1056}$.          </p>

Response: 48 \boxed{48}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Writing out the prime factors of $22$ and $48$, we see that $22 = 2 \cdot 11$ and $48 = 16 \cdot 3 = 2^4 \cdot 3$. Since $11$ does not divide $48$ and $3$ does not divide $22$, it follows that the greatest common factor of $22$ and $48$ is $2$.

The least common multiple, on the other hand, must account for the prime factors of both $22$ and $48$. The highest power of $2$ present in either term is $2^4 = 16$, of $3$ is $3^1 = 3$, and of $11$ is $11^1 = 11$. Thus, the LCM will be $2^4 \cdot 3 \cdot 11 = 528$. The product of the greatest common factor and the least common multiple is thus $2 \cdot 528 = \boxed{1056}$.          </p>

Reference Answer: Let
$$S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{3n-1}{2^n} = \frac{2}{2} + \frac{5}{4} + \frac{8}{8} + \frac{11}{16} + \dotsb.$$Then
$$2S = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{3n-1}{2^{n+1}} = 2 + \frac{5}{2} + \frac{8}{4} + \frac{11}{8} + \dotsb.$$Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us
$$S = 2 + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{8} + \dots = 2 + \frac{\frac{3}{2}}{1-\frac{1}{2}} = 2 + 3 = \boxed{5} .$$          </p>

Problem: Billy shoots an arrow from 10 feet above the ground. The height of this arrow can be expressed by the equation $h=10-23t-10t^2$, where $t$ is time in seconds since the arrow was shot. If the center of a target is raised 5 feet off the ground, in how many seconds must the arrow reach the target in order for Billy to hit the bulls eye? Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: \boxed{1}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Since the center of the target is 5 feet above the ground, $h=5$. So we get the quadratic: \begin{align*}5&amp; =10-23t-10t^{2}
\\ \Rightarrow\qquad 0&amp; =10t^{2}+23t-5
\\ \Rightarrow\qquad 0&amp;=(2t+5)(5t-1).
\end{align*}Thus, the values of $t$ that satisfy the equation are $-\frac52$ and $\frac15$. However, since time can never be a negative number, the answer must be $\boxed{\dfrac{1}{5}}$.          </p>

Problem: Billy shoots an arrow from 10 feet above the ground. The height of this arrow can be expressed by the equation $h=10-23t-10t^2$, where $t$ is time in seconds since the arrow was shot.
