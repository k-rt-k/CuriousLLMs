Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the set of simple coroots B∨ is always a base for the dual root system R∨. Let me start by recalling some definitions and properties related to root systems, dual root systems, chambers, and bases. 

First, a root system (V, R) consists of a finite set R of non-zero vectors (roots) in a Euclidean space V that satisfy certain axioms, like being closed under reflections and having rational Cartan numbers. The dual root system (V∨, R∨) is formed by taking the coroots α∨ = 2α/(α, α) for each root α in R. 

A chamber C, also known as a Weyl chamber, is a connected component of the complement in V of all the hyperplanes Hα = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0}. Each chamber is an open convex cone, and the group generated by the reflections over the hyperplanes Hα (the Weyl group) acts simply transitively on the chambers. 

For a given chamber C, the corresponding base B = B(C) is the unique set of simple roots {α1, ..., αl} such that C is defined by the intersection of the positive half-spaces determined by the simple roots. That is, C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. The simple roots form a basis of the vector space V and also a basis over the integers for the root lattice. 

Now, the question is whether the set B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} of simple coroots forms a base for the dual root system R∨. To check this, I need to verify if B∨ satisfies the properties of a base when considered in the dual root system. 

A base of a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of the base elements with all coefficients integers of the same sign (either all non-negative or all non-positive). So, for B∨ to be a base of R∨, every coroot β∨ in R∨ should be expressible as a linear combination of the αi∨ with coefficients all non-negative or all non-negative integers. 

First, note that the coroots α∨ are themselves roots in the dual root system R∨. So, B∨ is a subset of R∨. The key point is whether B∨ is a base in the sense of root systems for R∨. 

Given that dual root systems have a duality relationship, I suspect that the simple coroots should form a base for the dual system. However, I need to confirm this carefully. 

Let me recall that in the original root system R, the simple roots B = {α1, ..., αl} form a basis for V and define the positive roots R+ as those roots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple roots. Similarly, the positive coroots R∨+ would be those coroots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple coroots B∨. 

But wait, the coroot of a positive root is not necessarily a positive coroot. Let me check: If β is a positive root in R, then β = Σ niαi with ni ≥ 0. Then β∨ = 2β/(β, β). But how does this relate to the simple coroots? 

Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is that the dual root system R∨ has its own set of simple roots, which may or may not coincide with the simple coroots. 

Alternatively, since the dual of a root system is another root system, with the roles of roots and coroots swapped, perhaps the simple coroots in the original system correspond to the simple roots in the dual system. 

Wait, the coroot system R∨ is a root system in V∨, which is the dual space of V. But if V is equipped with an inner product, we can identify V with V∨, so perhaps they are considered in the same space. Wait, but actually, the coroot α∨ is defined as 2α/(α, α), so if we have a root α in V, then α∨ is in V as well, scaled by 2/(α, α). So the dual root system R∨ is in the same space V, not the dual space. That seems right because the definition of root systems usually includes being in a Euclidean space, and the dual roots are scaled versions. 

Therefore, R∨ is a root system in V, same as R. So the chambers for R∨ would be connected components of V minus the hyperplanes Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, (α∨)∨⟩ = 0}. But (α∨)∨ is equal to α, since the coroot of a coroot is the original root. So Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α⟩ = 0} = Hα. Wait, so the hyperplanes for R∨ are the same as the hyperplanes for R? 

Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s check. For the dual root system R∨, the hyperplanes would be Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β∨∨⟩ = 0}. But β∨ is a root in R∨, so (β∨)∨ = β∨∨ = 2β∨/(β∨, β∨). But β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = 2*(2β/(β, β)) / (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)).

Calculating the inner product in the denominator: (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)) = 4/(β, β)^2 * (β, β) = 4/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = (4β/(β, β)) / (4/(β, β)) ) = β. 

Hence, (β∨)∨ = β. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β⟩ = 0}, which are exactly the same as the hyperplanes Hβ for the original root system R. 

Therefore, the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same. Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of the hyperplanes, are the same for both root systems. 

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. If the hyperplanes are the same, then the chambers are the same. So a chamber C for R is also a chamber for R∨. 

But then, the base B(C) for R is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for each αi in B. Similarly, the base for R∨ corresponding to the same chamber C would be the set of simple roots for R∨, which are the simple coroots? Wait, but the simple roots for R∨ would be the set B∨?

But if the chambers are the same, then the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C should be the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of their positive half-spaces. But in R∨, the positive half-spaces are defined by ⟨x, β∨⟩ &gt; 0 for β∨ in R∨. But since β∨∨ = β, this is equivalent to ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. Wait, but in the original root system, the hyperplanes are defined by ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0. So the positive half-spaces for R∨ would be defined by ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0, where β is a root in R. But these are the same as the positive half-spaces for R, except that in R, the half-spaces are ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let&#x27;s clarify.

In the original root system R, the simple roots α1, ..., αl are such that the chamber C is the set of x in V where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

In the dual root system R∨, the roots are the coroots α∨ for α in R. The chamber for R∨ would be defined in terms of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots in R∨, which are the same hyperplanes as in R. So the chambers for R and R∨ are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the unique set of simple roots β1∨, ..., βl∨ in R∨ such that C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. But since βi∨∨ = βi, this is equivalent to C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. Therefore, in order for B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} to be the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C, we need that C is the set of x where ⟨x, αi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. But since αi∨∨ = αi, this would mean C is the set where ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

However, in the original definition, C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, unless ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is not generally true, these conditions are different. 

Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me check with an example. Let&#x27;s take the root system A1, which is just {α, -α}, with α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If we take the chamber C to be the positive half-line where ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, α⟩ &gt; 0 since α∨ is a positive multiple of α. So in this case, the chamber C is the same whether we use α or α∨. Hence, in this case, the simple coroot α∨ would generate the same chamber as α. 

But wait, in this case, since A1 is self-dual (since α∨ is just a scalar multiple of α), the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, the base for R∨ would just be the same as the base for R. 

But in higher rank root systems, perhaps this is different. Let&#x27;s consider the root system A2, which consists of the roots in the two-dimensional space with simple roots α1 and α2 at 120 degrees. The coroots α1∨ and α2∨ are scaled versions of α1 and α2. Specifically, if α1 and α2 have the same length, then the coroots would be the same roots scaled by 2/(α, α). For example, in the standard normalization where (α, α) = 2, the coroot α∨ is equal to α. But if (α, α) = 1, then α∨ = 2α. 

Wait, in the root system A2, all roots have the same length. Let&#x27;s say the roots are vectors in Euclidean space with length √2, so that (α, α) = 2. Then α∨ = 2α/(α, α) = α. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, in this case, the simple coroots are the same as the simple roots, so B∨ = B, and hence B∨ is a base for R∨, which is R itself. So in this case, yes, B∨ is a base. 

But suppose we have a root system where roots have different lengths, say B2 or G2. Let&#x27;s take B2. In B2, there are long and short roots. Let me recall that in B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The coroots would be α∨ = 2α/(α, α) and β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Since α is long, (α, α) is larger than (β, β). For example, in B2, we can take α = e1 - e2 and β = e2, with (α, α) = 2 and (β, β) = 1. Then α∨ = 2α/2 = α, and β∨ = 2β/1 = 2β. So the coroots in B2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ consists of the roots α and 2β and their negatives, which is actually the root system C2. 

So, in this case, R∨ is of type C2, and the simple coroots for B2 are α and 2β. But in the dual root system C2, the simple roots are different. Wait, the dual root system of B2 is C2, where the simple roots are the coroots of B2. However, in C2, the simple roots are the coroots of B2, so the simple roots for C2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the base B∨ = {α, 2β} is indeed the base for the dual root system C2. 

Wait, but in C2, the simple roots are usually denoted as γ1 and γ2, where γ1 is long and γ2 is short. But in our case, if B2 has simple roots α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ = α and β∨ = 2β, which are the simple roots for C2. Therefore, B∨ is indeed a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in this case, the answer is yes. But let me verify another example. Take G2, which is more complicated. In G2, there are long and short roots, with the ratio of squared lengths being 3. The dual root system of G2 is still G2, since it is self-dual. Wait, but actually, in G2, the roots and coroots have the same length ratio because the ratio of the squares is 3, so when you take coroots, you invert the scaling. Wait, if α is a long root with (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2α/3, and if β is a short root with (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β. So the dual root system would consist of roots 2α/3 and 2β. But is this isomorphic to G2? Wait, G2 is self-dual because the dual of a root system is determined by the inverse of the Cartan matrix, and G2 is simply-laced in some sense? No, G2 is not simply-laced. Wait, maybe it&#x27;s self-dual. Let me recall that in G2, the Cartan matrix is:

[ 2 -3 ]

[-1 2 ]

The inverse of this matrix is:

[2  3]

[1  2] 

divided by determinant, which is 4 - 3 = 1. So the inverse Cartan matrix is the same as the transpose, which would be the Cartan matrix of the dual root system. But since the inverse is not the same as the original, unless we rescale. Wait, but since the Cartan matrix for the dual root system is the transpose of the original Cartan matrix, which for G2 is not symmetric. Wait, but in G2, the Cartan matrix is not symmetric, so its dual root system would have the transpose Cartan matrix, which would correspond to swapping the roots. But in G2, the roots have different lengths, so the dual root system would have the Cartan matrix with entries swapped. However, since G2 is its own dual under the scaling of roots. Let me check if the dual root system is isomorphic to G2.

Wait, if the original roots are long and short, then the coroots would be short and long, respectively. Because α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If α is long, say (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2/3 α, which would be a shorter root. If β is short, (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β, which is longer. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ would have roots that are the coroots of R, which in G2 case are scaled such that the long roots become short and vice versa. But since G2 is self-dual in the sense that the dual root system is isomorphic to the original, just with roots scaled. Therefore, R∨ is isomorphic to R, so the base B∨ would correspond to the base of R∨, which is isomorphic, so yes, B∨ is a base. 

Wait, but if we take the simple roots in G2 as α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ (short) and β∨ (long). Then B∨ would consist of a short root and a long root. In the dual root system R∨, which is isomorphic to G2, the simple roots are these coroots. So, in effect, the base B∨ is a set of simple roots for R∨, which is isomorphic to G2. Therefore, yes, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in all these examples, the set of simple coroots B∨ is indeed a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, perhaps the answer is yes. But I need to ensure there isn&#x27;t some root system where this fails. 

Alternatively, let&#x27;s think abstractly. Since the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same, the chambers are the same. The base for R corresponding to chamber C is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. The base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the set of simple roots δ1, ..., δl in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, δi∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δi∨ = δi (since for R∨, the coroots are the original roots). Wait, no. Wait, in the dual root system R∨, the coroots are (α∨)∨ = α. So if we take R∨, its coroots are the original roots. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = 0} where δ is a root in R∨, i.e., δ = α∨ for some α in R. But δ∨ = (α∨)∨ = α. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = Hα, which are the same as hyperplanes for R. Therefore, as before, chambers are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for those roots. But in R∨, the positive half-space for a root δ ∈ R∨ is defined by ⟨x, δ∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δ ∈ R∨ means δ = β∨ for some β ∈ R. Therefore, ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = ⟨x, (β∨)∨⟩ = ⟨x, β⟩. Therefore, the positive half-space for δ = β∨ is ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all simple roots αi. So if we want the base for R∨, we need the simple roots δj in R∨ such that ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 defines C. But δj∨ = βj, so this becomes ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original system, the chamber C is also defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, if the set of βj is such that ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, then βj must be related to αi∨. 

Wait, this seems a bit circular. Let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have the chamber C. For the original root system R, the simple roots αi are the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. For the dual root system R∨, the simple roots δj must be the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δj∨ is in R, since δj is in R∨. So δj∨ = αj. Therefore, the condition ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, for the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. But in the original system, C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Therefore, unless ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 and ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 define the same chamber, which is only the case if αj and αj∨ are scalar multiples. But αj∨ = 2αj/(αj, αj). Therefore, αj∨ is a scalar multiple of αj. Hence, the half-space ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is the same as ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 if and only if the scalar is positive, which it is. Since 2/(αj, αj) is positive, then yes, ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the chamber C is defined equivalently by either ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 or ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, in the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the set of simple roots for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the set of δj such that δj∨ = αj, which implies δj = αj∨. Therefore, the simple roots for R∨ are exactly the simple coroots B∨. 

Therefore, this shows that the set B∨ is indeed the base for the dual root system R∨ corresponding to the chamber C. 

Thus, in general, the simple coroots B∨ form a base for the dual root system R∨. 

But let me verify once again. Suppose that in the dual root system R∨, the simple roots are the simple coroots of R. Then the positive coroots in R∨ would be the non-negative linear combinations of the simple coroots. But in R∨, the roots are the coroots of R, so the positive coroots would correspond to the positive roots in R∨. But a positive root in R∨ is a coroot that is a non-negative combination of the simple coroots. However, in the original system, the positive roots are non-negative combinations of the simple roots. There&#x27;s a duality here. 

For example, in the original root system, a positive root is a sum of simple roots with non-negative coefficients. The coroot of a positive root is a positive coroot, but the positive coroots are not necessarily the same as the non-negative combinations of simple coroots. Wait, but if B∨ is a base for R∨, then every positive coroot in R∨ is a non-negative combination of B∨. Let me check with B2 example. 

In B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The positive roots are α, β, α + β, α + 2β. The coroots would be α∨ = α, β∨ = 2β. The positive coroots are α, 2β, α + 2β, 2α + 4β. Wait, no. Wait, the coroots of the roots are:

For α: α∨ = α.

For β: β∨ = 2β.

For α + β: (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/(α + β, α + β). Let&#x27;s compute (α + β, α + β) = (α, α) + 2(α, β) + (β, β). In B2, (α, α) = 2, (β, β) = 1, and (α, β) = -1. Therefore, (α + β, α + β) = 2 + 2*(-1) + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Therefore, (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/1 = 2α + 2β.

Similarly, for α + 2β: (α + 2β, α + 2β) = (α, α) + 4(α, β) + 4(β, β) = 2 + 4*(-1) + 4*1 = 2 -4 +4 = 2. Therefore, (α + 2β)∨ = 2(α + 2β)/2 = α + 2β.

Therefore, the positive coroots in R∨ are α, 2β, 2α + 2β, and α + 2β. 

Now, the simple coroots B∨ = {α∨, β∨} = {α, 2β}. The positive coroots in R∨ should be the non-negative combinations of α and 2β. Let&#x27;s see:

- α is a non-negative combination of α and 2β (1*α + 0*2β).
- 2β is 0*α + 1*2β.
- 2α + 2β is 2*α + 1*2β.
- α + 2β is 1*α + 1*2β.

Therefore, all positive coroots in R∨ are indeed non-negative combinations of the simple coroots B∨. Therefore, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Similarly, if we take a positive coroot like 2α + 2β, which is not a coroot of a simple root, but it is a combination of the simple coroots. Therefore, B∨ satisfies the conditions of a base. 

Hence, through these examples and abstract reasoning, it seems that the simple coroots B∨ indeed form a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the set of simple coroots \( B^\vee = \{\alpha_1^\vee, \ldots, \alpha_l^\vee\} \) forms a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \), we need to verify if \( B^\vee \) satisfies the properties of a base in the dual root system. 

1. **Hyperplanes and Chambers**: The hyperplanes for the dual root system \( R^\vee \) are the same as those for the original root system \( R \). This is because the coroot of a coroot \( (\alpha^\vee)^\vee \) is the original root \( \alpha \). Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of these hyperplanes, are the same for both \( R \) and \( R^\vee \).

2. **Base Definition**: A base for a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of these simple roots with all coefficients integers of the same sign. For \( B^\vee \) to be a base for \( R^\vee \), every coroot \( \beta^\vee \in R^\vee \) must be expressible as a non-negative or non-positive integer combination of the simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \).

3. **Duality Relationship**: The dual root system \( R^\vee \) consists of coroots \( \alpha^\vee \) for each root \( \alpha \in R \). The simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \) are scaled versions of the simple roots \( \alpha_i \). For a chamber \( C \), the base \( B \) of \( R \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i^\vee \rangle &gt; 0 \). For the dual root system \( R^\vee \), the same chamber \( C \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i \rangle &gt; 0 \), which is equivalent due to the scaling relationship between roots and coroots.

4. **Verification with Examples**: Checking examples such as \( A_1 \), \( A_2 \), \( B_2 \), and \( G_2 \) confirms that the simple coroots form a base for the dual root system. In each case, the simple coroots correspond to the simple roots of the dual system, ensuring that all positive coroots in \( R^\vee \) are non-negative combinations of the simple coroots.

Thus, the set \( B^\vee \) of simple coroots is indeed a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the set of simple coroots B∨ is always a base for the dual root system R∨. Let me start by recalling some definitions and properties related to root systems, dual root systems, chambers, and bases. 

First, a root system (V, R) consists of a finite set R of non-zero vectors (roots) in a Euclidean space V that satisfy certain axioms, like being closed under reflections and having rational Cartan numbers. The dual root system (V∨, R∨) is formed by taking the coroots α∨ = 2α/(α, α) for each root α in R. 

A chamber C, also known as a Weyl chamber, is a connected component of the complement in V of all the hyperplanes Hα = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0}. Each chamber is an open convex cone, and the group generated by the reflections over the hyperplanes Hα (the Weyl group) acts simply transitively on the chambers. 

For a given chamber C, the corresponding base B = B(C) is the unique set of simple roots {α1, ..., αl} such that C is defined by the intersection of the positive half-spaces determined by the simple roots. That is, C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. The simple roots form a basis of the vector space V and also a basis over the integers for the root lattice. 

Now, the question is whether the set B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} of simple coroots forms a base for the dual root system R∨. To check this, I need to verify if B∨ satisfies the properties of a base when considered in the dual root system. 

A base of a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of the base elements with all coefficients integers of the same sign (either all non-negative or all non-positive). So, for B∨ to be a base of R∨, every coroot β∨ in R∨ should be expressible as a linear combination of the αi∨ with coefficients all non-negative or all non-negative integers. 

First, note that the coroots α∨ are themselves roots in the dual root system R∨. So, B∨ is a subset of R∨. The key point is whether B∨ is a base in the sense of root systems for R∨. 

Given that dual root systems have a duality relationship, I suspect that the simple coroots should form a base for the dual system. However, I need to confirm this carefully. 

Let me recall that in the original root system R, the simple roots B = {α1, ..., αl} form a basis for V and define the positive roots R+ as those roots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple roots. Similarly, the positive coroots R∨+ would be those coroots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple coroots B∨. 

But wait, the coroot of a positive root is not necessarily a positive coroot. Let me check: If β is a positive root in R, then β = Σ niαi with ni ≥ 0. Then β∨ = 2β/(β, β). But how does this relate to the simple coroots? 

Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is that the dual root system R∨ has its own set of simple roots, which may or may not coincide with the simple coroots. 

Alternatively, since the dual of a root system is another root system, with the roles of roots and coroots swapped, perhaps the simple coroots in the original system correspond to the simple roots in the dual system. 

Wait, the coroot system R∨ is a root system in V∨, which is the dual space of V. But if V is equipped with an inner product, we can identify V with V∨, so perhaps they are considered in the same space. Wait, but actually, the coroot α∨ is defined as 2α/(α, α), so if we have a root α in V, then α∨ is in V as well, scaled by 2/(α, α). So the dual root system R∨ is in the same space V, not the dual space. That seems right because the definition of root systems usually includes being in a Euclidean space, and the dual roots are scaled versions. 

Therefore, R∨ is a root system in V, same as R. So the chambers for R∨ would be connected components of V minus the hyperplanes Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, (α∨)∨⟩ = 0}. But (α∨)∨ is equal to α, since the coroot of a coroot is the original root. So Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α⟩ = 0} = Hα. Wait, so the hyperplanes for R∨ are the same as the hyperplanes for R? 

Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s check. For the dual root system R∨, the hyperplanes would be Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β∨∨⟩ = 0}. But β∨ is a root in R∨, so (β∨)∨ = β∨∨ = 2β∨/(β∨, β∨). But β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = 2*(2β/(β, β)) / (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)).

Calculating the inner product in the denominator: (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)) = 4/(β, β)^2 * (β, β) = 4/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = (4β/(β, β)) / (4/(β, β)) ) = β. 

Hence, (β∨)∨ = β. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β⟩ = 0}, which are exactly the same as the hyperplanes Hβ for the original root system R. 

Therefore, the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same. Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of the hyperplanes, are the same for both root systems. 

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. If the hyperplanes are the same, then the chambers are the same. So a chamber C for R is also a chamber for R∨. 

But then, the base B(C) for R is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for each αi in B. Similarly, the base for R∨ corresponding to the same chamber C would be the set of simple roots for R∨, which are the simple coroots? Wait, but the simple roots for R∨ would be the set B∨?

But if the chambers are the same, then the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C should be the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of their positive half-spaces. But in R∨, the positive half-spaces are defined by ⟨x, β∨⟩ &gt; 0 for β∨ in R∨. But since β∨∨ = β, this is equivalent to ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. Wait, but in the original root system, the hyperplanes are defined by ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0. So the positive half-spaces for R∨ would be defined by ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0, where β is a root in R. But these are the same as the positive half-spaces for R, except that in R, the half-spaces are ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let&#x27;s clarify.

In the original root system R, the simple roots α1, ..., αl are such that the chamber C is the set of x in V where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

In the dual root system R∨, the roots are the coroots α∨ for α in R. The chamber for R∨ would be defined in terms of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots in R∨, which are the same hyperplanes as in R. So the chambers for R and R∨ are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the unique set of simple roots β1∨, ..., βl∨ in R∨ such that C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. But since βi∨∨ = βi, this is equivalent to C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. Therefore, in order for B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} to be the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C, we need that C is the set of x where ⟨x, αi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. But since αi∨∨ = αi, this would mean C is the set where ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

However, in the original definition, C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, unless ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is not generally true, these conditions are different. 

Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me check with an example. Let&#x27;s take the root system A1, which is just {α, -α}, with α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If we take the chamber C to be the positive half-line where ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, α⟩ &gt; 0 since α∨ is a positive multiple of α. So in this case, the chamber C is the same whether we use α or α∨. Hence, in this case, the simple coroot α∨ would generate the same chamber as α. 

But wait, in this case, since A1 is self-dual (since α∨ is just a scalar multiple of α), the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, the base for R∨ would just be the same as the base for R. 

But in higher rank root systems, perhaps this is different. Let&#x27;s consider the root system A2, which consists of the roots in the two-dimensional space with simple roots α1 and α2 at 120 degrees. The coroots α1∨ and α2∨ are scaled versions of α1 and α2. Specifically, if α1 and α2 have the same length, then the coroots would be the same roots scaled by 2/(α, α). For example, in the standard normalization where (α, α) = 2, the coroot α∨ is equal to α. But if (α, α) = 1, then α∨ = 2α. 

Wait, in the root system A2, all roots have the same length. Let&#x27;s say the roots are vectors in Euclidean space with length √2, so that (α, α) = 2. Then α∨ = 2α/(α, α) = α. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, in this case, the simple coroots are the same as the simple roots, so B∨ = B, and hence B∨ is a base for R∨, which is R itself. So in this case, yes, B∨ is a base. 

But suppose we have a root system where roots have different lengths, say B2 or G2. Let&#x27;s take B2. In B2, there are long and short roots. Let me recall that in B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The coroots would be α∨ = 2α/(α, α) and β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Since α is long, (α, α) is larger than (β, β). For example, in B2, we can take α = e1 - e2 and β = e2, with (α, α) = 2 and (β, β) = 1. Then α∨ = 2α/2 = α, and β∨ = 2β/1 = 2β. So the coroots in B2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ consists of the roots α and 2β and their negatives, which is actually the root system C2. 

So, in this case, R∨ is of type C2, and the simple coroots for B2 are α and 2β. But in the dual root system C2, the simple roots are different. Wait, the dual root system of B2 is C2, where the simple roots are the coroots of B2. However, in C2, the simple roots are the coroots of B2, so the simple roots for C2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the base B∨ = {α, 2β} is indeed the base for the dual root system C2. 

Wait, but in C2, the simple roots are usually denoted as γ1 and γ2, where γ1 is long and γ2 is short. But in our case, if B2 has simple roots α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ = α and β∨ = 2β, which are the simple roots for C2. Therefore, B∨ is indeed a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in this case, the answer is yes. But let me verify another example. Take G2, which is more complicated. In G2, there are long and short roots, with the ratio of squared lengths being 3. The dual root system of G2 is still G2, since it is self-dual. Wait, but actually, in G2, the roots and coroots have the same length ratio because the ratio of the squares is 3, so when you take coroots, you invert the scaling. Wait, if α is a long root with (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2α/3, and if β is a short root with (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β. So the dual root system would consist of roots 2α/3 and 2β. But is this isomorphic to G2? Wait, G2 is self-dual because the dual of a root system is determined by the inverse of the Cartan matrix, and G2 is simply-laced in some sense? No, G2 is not simply-laced. Wait, maybe it&#x27;s self-dual. Let me recall that in G2, the Cartan matrix is:

[ 2 -3 ]

[-1 2 ]

The inverse of this matrix is:

[2  3]

[1  2] 

divided by determinant, which is 4 - 3 = 1. So the inverse Cartan matrix is the same as the transpose, which would be the Cartan matrix of the dual root system. But since the inverse is not the same as the original, unless we rescale. Wait, but since the Cartan matrix for the dual root system is the transpose of the original Cartan matrix, which for G2 is not symmetric. Wait, but in G2, the Cartan matrix is not symmetric, so its dual root system would have the transpose Cartan matrix, which would correspond to swapping the roots. But in G2, the roots have different lengths, so the dual root system would have the Cartan matrix with entries swapped. However, since G2 is its own dual under the scaling of roots. Let me check if the dual root system is isomorphic to G2.

Wait, if the original roots are long and short, then the coroots would be short and long, respectively. Because α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If α is long, say (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2/3 α, which would be a shorter root. If β is short, (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β, which is longer. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ would have roots that are the coroots of R, which in G2 case are scaled such that the long roots become short and vice versa. But since G2 is self-dual in the sense that the dual root system is isomorphic to the original, just with roots scaled. Therefore, R∨ is isomorphic to R, so the base B∨ would correspond to the base of R∨, which is isomorphic, so yes, B∨ is a base. 

Wait, but if we take the simple roots in G2 as α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ (short) and β∨ (long). Then B∨ would consist of a short root and a long root. In the dual root system R∨, which is isomorphic to G2, the simple roots are these coroots. So, in effect, the base B∨ is a set of simple roots for R∨, which is isomorphic to G2. Therefore, yes, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in all these examples, the set of simple coroots B∨ is indeed a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, perhaps the answer is yes. But I need to ensure there isn&#x27;t some root system where this fails. 

Alternatively, let&#x27;s think abstractly. Since the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same, the chambers are the same. The base for R corresponding to chamber C is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. The base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the set of simple roots δ1, ..., δl in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, δi∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δi∨ = δi (since for R∨, the coroots are the original roots). Wait, no. Wait, in the dual root system R∨, the coroots are (α∨)∨ = α. So if we take R∨, its coroots are the original roots. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = 0} where δ is a root in R∨, i.e., δ = α∨ for some α in R. But δ∨ = (α∨)∨ = α. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = Hα, which are the same as hyperplanes for R. Therefore, as before, chambers are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for those roots. But in R∨, the positive half-space for a root δ ∈ R∨ is defined by ⟨x, δ∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δ ∈ R∨ means δ = β∨ for some β ∈ R. Therefore, ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = ⟨x, (β∨)∨⟩ = ⟨x, β⟩. Therefore, the positive half-space for δ = β∨ is ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all simple roots αi. So if we want the base for R∨, we need the simple roots δj in R∨ such that ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 defines C. But δj∨ = βj, so this becomes ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original system, the chamber C is also defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, if the set of βj is such that ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, then βj must be related to αi∨. 

Wait, this seems a bit circular. Let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have the chamber C. For the original root system R, the simple roots αi are the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. For the dual root system R∨, the simple roots δj must be the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δj∨ is in R, since δj is in R∨. So δj∨ = αj. Therefore, the condition ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, for the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. But in the original system, C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Therefore, unless ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 and ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 define the same chamber, which is only the case if αj and αj∨ are scalar multiples. But αj∨ = 2αj/(αj, αj). Therefore, αj∨ is a scalar multiple of αj. Hence, the half-space ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is the same as ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 if and only if the scalar is positive, which it is. Since 2/(αj, αj) is positive, then yes, ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the chamber C is defined equivalently by either ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 or ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, in the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the set of simple roots for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the set of δj such that δj∨ = αj, which implies δj = αj∨. Therefore, the simple roots for R∨ are exactly the simple coroots B∨. 

Therefore, this shows that the set B∨ is indeed the base for the dual root system R∨ corresponding to the chamber C. 

Thus, in general, the simple coroots B∨ form a base for the dual root system R∨. 

But let me verify once again. Suppose that in the dual root system R∨, the simple roots are the simple coroots of R. Then the positive coroots in R∨ would be the non-negative linear combinations of the simple coroots. But in R∨, the roots are the coroots of R, so the positive coroots would correspond to the positive roots in R∨. But a positive root in R∨ is a coroot that is a non-negative combination of the simple coroots. However, in the original system, the positive roots are non-negative combinations of the simple roots. There&#x27;s a duality here. 

For example, in the original root system, a positive root is a sum of simple roots with non-negative coefficients. The coroot of a positive root is a positive coroot, but the positive coroots are not necessarily the same as the non-negative combinations of simple coroots. Wait, but if B∨ is a base for R∨, then every positive coroot in R∨ is a non-negative combination of B∨. Let me check with B2 example. 

In B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The positive roots are α, β, α + β, α + 2β. The coroots would be α∨ = α, β∨ = 2β. The positive coroots are α, 2β, α + 2β, 2α + 4β. Wait, no. Wait, the coroots of the roots are:

For α: α∨ = α.

For β: β∨ = 2β.

For α + β: (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/(α + β, α + β). Let&#x27;s compute (α + β, α + β) = (α, α) + 2(α, β) + (β, β). In B2, (α, α) = 2, (β, β) = 1, and (α, β) = -1. Therefore, (α + β, α + β) = 2 + 2*(-1) + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Therefore, (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/1 = 2α + 2β.

Similarly, for α + 2β: (α + 2β, α + 2β) = (α, α) + 4(α, β) + 4(β, β) = 2 + 4*(-1) + 4*1 = 2 -4 +4 = 2. Therefore, (α + 2β)∨ = 2(α + 2β)/2 = α + 2β.

Therefore, the positive coroots in R∨ are α, 2β, 2α + 2β, and α + 2β. 

Now, the simple coroots B∨ = {α∨, β∨} = {α, 2β}. The positive coroots in R∨ should be the non-negative combinations of α and 2β. Let&#x27;s see:

- α is a non-negative combination of α and 2β (1*α + 0*2β).
- 2β is 0*α + 1*2β.
- 2α + 2β is 2*α + 1*2β.
- α + 2β is 1*α + 1*2β.

Therefore, all positive coroots in R∨ are indeed non-negative combinations of the simple coroots B∨. Therefore, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Similarly, if we take a positive coroot like 2α + 2β, which is not a coroot of a simple root, but it is a combination of the simple coroots. Therefore, B∨ satisfies the conditions of a base. 

Hence, through these examples and abstract reasoning, it seems that the simple coroots B∨ indeed form a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the set of simple coroots \( B^\vee = \{\alpha_1^\vee, \ldots, \alpha_l^\vee\} \) forms a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \), we need to verify if \( B^\vee \) satisfies the properties of a base in the dual root system. 

1. **Hyperplanes and Chambers**: The hyperplanes for the dual root system \( R^\vee \) are the same as those for the original root system \( R \). This is because the coroot of a coroot \( (\alpha^\vee)^\vee \) is the original root \( \alpha \). Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of these hyperplanes, are the same for both \( R \) and \( R^\vee \).

2. **Base Definition**: A base for a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of these simple roots with all coefficients integers of the same sign. For \( B^\vee \) to be a base for \( R^\vee \), every coroot \( \beta^\vee \in R^\vee \) must be expressible as a non-negative or non-positive integer combination of the simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \).

3. **Duality Relationship**: The dual root system \( R^\vee \) consists of coroots \( \alpha^\vee \) for each root \( \alpha \in R \). The simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \) are scaled versions of the simple roots \( \alpha_i \). For a chamber \( C \), the base \( B \) of \( R \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i^\vee \rangle &gt; 0 \). For the dual root system \( R^\vee \), the same chamber \( C \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i \rangle &gt; 0 \), which is equivalent due to the scaling relationship between roots and coroots.

4. **Verification with Examples**: Checking examples such as \( A_1 \), \( A_2 \), \( B_2 \), and \( G_2 \) confirms that the simple coroots form a base for the dual root system. In each case, the simple coroots correspond to the simple roots of the dual system, ensuring that all positive coroots in \( R^\vee \) are non-negative combinations of the simple coroots.

Thus, the set \( B^\vee \) of simple coroots is indeed a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the set of simple coroots B∨ is always a base for the dual root system R∨. Let me start by recalling some definitions and properties related to root systems, dual root systems, chambers, and bases. 

First, a root system (V, R) consists of a finite set R of non-zero vectors (roots) in a Euclidean space V that satisfy certain axioms, like being closed under reflections and having rational Cartan numbers. The dual root system (V∨, R∨) is formed by taking the coroots α∨ = 2α/(α, α) for each root α in R. 

A chamber C, also known as a Weyl chamber, is a connected component of the complement in V of all the hyperplanes Hα = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0}. Each chamber is an open convex cone, and the group generated by the reflections over the hyperplanes Hα (the Weyl group) acts simply transitively on the chambers. 

For a given chamber C, the corresponding base B = B(C) is the unique set of simple roots {α1, ..., αl} such that C is defined by the intersection of the positive half-spaces determined by the simple roots. That is, C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. The simple roots form a basis of the vector space V and also a basis over the integers for the root lattice. 

Now, the question is whether the set B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} of simple coroots forms a base for the dual root system R∨. To check this, I need to verify if B∨ satisfies the properties of a base when considered in the dual root system. 

A base of a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of the base elements with all coefficients integers of the same sign (either all non-negative or all non-positive). So, for B∨ to be a base of R∨, every coroot β∨ in R∨ should be expressible as a linear combination of the αi∨ with coefficients all non-negative or all non-negative integers. 

First, note that the coroots α∨ are themselves roots in the dual root system R∨. So, B∨ is a subset of R∨. The key point is whether B∨ is a base in the sense of root systems for R∨. 

Given that dual root systems have a duality relationship, I suspect that the simple coroots should form a base for the dual system. However, I need to confirm this carefully. 

Let me recall that in the original root system R, the simple roots B = {α1, ..., αl} form a basis for V and define the positive roots R+ as those roots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple roots. Similarly, the positive coroots R∨+ would be those coroots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple coroots B∨. 

But wait, the coroot of a positive root is not necessarily a positive coroot. Let me check: If β is a positive root in R, then β = Σ niαi with ni ≥ 0. Then β∨ = 2β/(β, β). But how does this relate to the simple coroots? 

Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is that the dual root system R∨ has its own set of simple roots, which may or may not coincide with the simple coroots. 

Alternatively, since the dual of a root system is another root system, with the roles of roots and coroots swapped, perhaps the simple coroots in the original system correspond to the simple roots in the dual system. 

Wait, the coroot system R∨ is a root system in V∨, which is the dual space of V. But if V is equipped with an inner product, we can identify V with V∨, so perhaps they are considered in the same space. Wait, but actually, the coroot α∨ is defined as 2α/(α, α), so if we have a root α in V, then α∨ is in V as well, scaled by 2/(α, α). So the dual root system R∨ is in the same space V, not the dual space. That seems right because the definition of root systems usually includes being in a Euclidean space, and the dual roots are scaled versions. 

Therefore, R∨ is a root system in V, same as R. So the chambers for R∨ would be connected components of V minus the hyperplanes Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, (α∨)∨⟩ = 0}. But (α∨)∨ is equal to α, since the coroot of a coroot is the original root. So Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α⟩ = 0} = Hα. Wait, so the hyperplanes for R∨ are the same as the hyperplanes for R? 

Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s check. For the dual root system R∨, the hyperplanes would be Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β∨∨⟩ = 0}. But β∨ is a root in R∨, so (β∨)∨ = β∨∨ = 2β∨/(β∨, β∨). But β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = 2*(2β/(β, β)) / (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)).

Calculating the inner product in the denominator: (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)) = 4/(β, β)^2 * (β, β) = 4/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = (4β/(β, β)) / (4/(β, β)) ) = β. 

Hence, (β∨)∨ = β. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β⟩ = 0}, which are exactly the same as the hyperplanes Hβ for the original root system R. 

Therefore, the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same. Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of the hyperplanes, are the same for both root systems. 

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. If the hyperplanes are the same, then the chambers are the same. So a chamber C for R is also a chamber for R∨. 

But then, the base B(C) for R is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for each αi in B. Similarly, the base for R∨ corresponding to the same chamber C would be the set of simple roots for R∨, which are the simple coroots? Wait, but the simple roots for R∨ would be the set B∨?

But if the chambers are the same, then the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C should be the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of their positive half-spaces. But in R∨, the positive half-spaces are defined by ⟨x, β∨⟩ &gt; 0 for β∨ in R∨. But since β∨∨ = β, this is equivalent to ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. Wait, but in the original root system, the hyperplanes are defined by ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0. So the positive half-spaces for R∨ would be defined by ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0, where β is a root in R. But these are the same as the positive half-spaces for R, except that in R, the half-spaces are ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let&#x27;s clarify.

In the original root system R, the simple roots α1, ..., αl are such that the chamber C is the set of x in V where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

In the dual root system R∨, the roots are the coroots α∨ for α in R. The chamber for R∨ would be defined in terms of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots in R∨, which are the same hyperplanes as in R. So the chambers for R and R∨ are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the unique set of simple roots β1∨, ..., βl∨ in R∨ such that C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. But since βi∨∨ = βi, this is equivalent to C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. Therefore, in order for B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} to be the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C, we need that C is the set of x where ⟨x, αi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. But since αi∨∨ = αi, this would mean C is the set where ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

However, in the original definition, C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, unless ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is not generally true, these conditions are different. 

Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me check with an example. Let&#x27;s take the root system A1, which is just {α, -α}, with α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If we take the chamber C to be the positive half-line where ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, α⟩ &gt; 0 since α∨ is a positive multiple of α. So in this case, the chamber C is the same whether we use α or α∨. Hence, in this case, the simple coroot α∨ would generate the same chamber as α. 

But wait, in this case, since A1 is self-dual (since α∨ is just a scalar multiple of α), the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, the base for R∨ would just be the same as the base for R. 

But in higher rank root systems, perhaps this is different. Let&#x27;s consider the root system A2, which consists of the roots in the two-dimensional space with simple roots α1 and α2 at 120 degrees. The coroots α1∨ and α2∨ are scaled versions of α1 and α2. Specifically, if α1 and α2 have the same length, then the coroots would be the same roots scaled by 2/(α, α). For example, in the standard normalization where (α, α) = 2, the coroot α∨ is equal to α. But if (α, α) = 1, then α∨ = 2α. 

Wait, in the root system A2, all roots have the same length. Let&#x27;s say the roots are vectors in Euclidean space with length √2, so that (α, α) = 2. Then α∨ = 2α/(α, α) = α. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, in this case, the simple coroots are the same as the simple roots, so B∨ = B, and hence B∨ is a base for R∨, which is R itself. So in this case, yes, B∨ is a base. 

But suppose we have a root system where roots have different lengths, say B2 or G2. Let&#x27;s take B2. In B2, there are long and short roots. Let me recall that in B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The coroots would be α∨ = 2α/(α, α) and β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Since α is long, (α, α) is larger than (β, β). For example, in B2, we can take α = e1 - e2 and β = e2, with (α, α) = 2 and (β, β) = 1. Then α∨ = 2α/2 = α, and β∨ = 2β/1 = 2β. So the coroots in B2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ consists of the roots α and 2β and their negatives, which is actually the root system C2. 

So, in this case, R∨ is of type C2, and the simple coroots for B2 are α and 2β. But in the dual root system C2, the simple roots are different. Wait, the dual root system of B2 is C2, where the simple roots are the coroots of B2. However, in C2, the simple roots are the coroots of B2, so the simple roots for C2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the base B∨ = {α, 2β} is indeed the base for the dual root system C2. 

Wait, but in C2, the simple roots are usually denoted as γ1 and γ2, where γ1 is long and γ2 is short. But in our case, if B2 has simple roots α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ = α and β∨ = 2β, which are the simple roots for C2. Therefore, B∨ is indeed a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in this case, the answer is yes. But let me verify another example. Take G2, which is more complicated. In G2, there are long and short roots, with the ratio of squared lengths being 3. The dual root system of G2 is still G2, since it is self-dual. Wait, but actually, in G2, the roots and coroots have the same length ratio because the ratio of the squares is 3, so when you take coroots, you invert the scaling. Wait, if α is a long root with (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2α/3, and if β is a short root with (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β. So the dual root system would consist of roots 2α/3 and 2β. But is this isomorphic to G2? Wait, G2 is self-dual because the dual of a root system is determined by the inverse of the Cartan matrix, and G2 is simply-laced in some sense? No, G2 is not simply-laced. Wait, maybe it&#x27;s self-dual. Let me recall that in G2, the Cartan matrix is:

[ 2 -3 ]

[-1 2 ]

The inverse of this matrix is:

[2  3]

[1  2] 

divided by determinant, which is 4 - 3 = 1. So the inverse Cartan matrix is the same as the transpose, which would be the Cartan matrix of the dual root system. But since the inverse is not the same as the original, unless we rescale. Wait, but since the Cartan matrix for the dual root system is the transpose of the original Cartan matrix, which for G2 is not symmetric. Wait, but in G2, the Cartan matrix is not symmetric, so its dual root system would have the transpose Cartan matrix, which would correspond to swapping the roots. But in G2, the roots have different lengths, so the dual root system would have the Cartan matrix with entries swapped. However, since G2 is its own dual under the scaling of roots. Let me check if the dual root system is isomorphic to G2.

Wait, if the original roots are long and short, then the coroots would be short and long, respectively. Because α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If α is long, say (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2/3 α, which would be a shorter root. If β is short, (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β, which is longer. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ would have roots that are the coroots of R, which in G2 case are scaled such that the long roots become short and vice versa. But since G2 is self-dual in the sense that the dual root system is isomorphic to the original, just with roots scaled. Therefore, R∨ is isomorphic to R, so the base B∨ would correspond to the base of R∨, which is isomorphic, so yes, B∨ is a base. 

Wait, but if we take the simple roots in G2 as α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ (short) and β∨ (long). Then B∨ would consist of a short root and a long root. In the dual root system R∨, which is isomorphic to G2, the simple roots are these coroots. So, in effect, the base B∨ is a set of simple roots for R∨, which is isomorphic to G2. Therefore, yes, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in all these examples, the set of simple coroots B∨ is indeed a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, perhaps the answer is yes. But I need to ensure there isn&#x27;t some root system where this fails. 

Alternatively, let&#x27;s think abstractly. Since the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same, the chambers are the same. The base for R corresponding to chamber C is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. The base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the set of simple roots δ1, ..., δl in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, δi∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δi∨ = δi (since for R∨, the coroots are the original roots). Wait, no. Wait, in the dual root system R∨, the coroots are (α∨)∨ = α. So if we take R∨, its coroots are the original roots. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = 0} where δ is a root in R∨, i.e., δ = α∨ for some α in R. But δ∨ = (α∨)∨ = α. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = Hα, which are the same as hyperplanes for R. Therefore, as before, chambers are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for those roots. But in R∨, the positive half-space for a root δ ∈ R∨ is defined by ⟨x, δ∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δ ∈ R∨ means δ = β∨ for some β ∈ R. Therefore, ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = ⟨x, (β∨)∨⟩ = ⟨x, β⟩. Therefore, the positive half-space for δ = β∨ is ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all simple roots αi. So if we want the base for R∨, we need the simple roots δj in R∨ such that ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 defines C. But δj∨ = βj, so this becomes ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original system, the chamber C is also defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, if the set of βj is such that ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, then βj must be related to αi∨. 

Wait, this seems a bit circular. Let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have the chamber C. For the original root system R, the simple roots αi are the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. For the dual root system R∨, the simple roots δj must be the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δj∨ is in R, since δj is in R∨. So δj∨ = αj. Therefore, the condition ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, for the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. But in the original system, C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Therefore, unless ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 and ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 define the same chamber, which is only the case if αj and αj∨ are scalar multiples. But αj∨ = 2αj/(αj, αj). Therefore, αj∨ is a scalar multiple of αj. Hence, the half-space ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is the same as ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 if and only if the scalar is positive, which it is. Since 2/(αj, αj) is positive, then yes, ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the chamber C is defined equivalently by either ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 or ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, in the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the set of simple roots for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the set of δj such that δj∨ = αj, which implies δj = αj∨. Therefore, the simple roots for R∨ are exactly the simple coroots B∨. 

Therefore, this shows that the set B∨ is indeed the base for the dual root system R∨ corresponding to the chamber C. 

Thus, in general, the simple coroots B∨ form a base for the dual root system R∨. 

But let me verify once again. Suppose that in the dual root system R∨, the simple roots are the simple coroots of R. Then the positive coroots in R∨ would be the non-negative linear combinations of the simple coroots. But in R∨, the roots are the coroots of R, so the positive coroots would correspond to the positive roots in R∨. But a positive root in R∨ is a coroot that is a non-negative combination of the simple coroots. However, in the original system, the positive roots are non-negative combinations of the simple roots. There&#x27;s a duality here. 

For example, in the original root system, a positive root is a sum of simple roots with non-negative coefficients. The coroot of a positive root is a positive coroot, but the positive coroots are not necessarily the same as the non-negative combinations of simple coroots. Wait, but if B∨ is a base for R∨, then every positive coroot in R∨ is a non-negative combination of B∨. Let me check with B2 example. 

In B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The positive roots are α, β, α + β, α + 2β. The coroots would be α∨ = α, β∨ = 2β. The positive coroots are α, 2β, α + 2β, 2α + 4β. Wait, no. Wait, the coroots of the roots are:

For α: α∨ = α.

For β: β∨ = 2β.

For α + β: (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/(α + β, α + β). Let&#x27;s compute (α + β, α + β) = (α, α) + 2(α, β) + (β, β). In B2, (α, α) = 2, (β, β) = 1, and (α, β) = -1. Therefore, (α + β, α + β) = 2 + 2*(-1) + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Therefore, (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/1 = 2α + 2β.

Similarly, for α + 2β: (α + 2β, α + 2β) = (α, α) + 4(α, β) + 4(β, β) = 2 + 4*(-1) + 4*1 = 2 -4 +4 = 2. Therefore, (α + 2β)∨ = 2(α + 2β)/2 = α + 2β.

Therefore, the positive coroots in R∨ are α, 2β, 2α + 2β, and α + 2β. 

Now, the simple coroots B∨ = {α∨, β∨} = {α, 2β}. The positive coroots in R∨ should be the non-negative combinations of α and 2β. Let&#x27;s see:

- α is a non-negative combination of α and 2β (1*α + 0*2β).
- 2β is 0*α + 1*2β.
- 2α + 2β is 2*α + 1*2β.
- α + 2β is 1*α + 1*2β.

Therefore, all positive coroots in R∨ are indeed non-negative combinations of the simple coroots B∨. Therefore, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Similarly, if we take a positive coroot like 2α + 2β, which is not a coroot of a simple root, but it is a combination of the simple coroots. Therefore, B∨ satisfies the conditions of a base. 

Hence, through these examples and abstract reasoning, it seems that the simple coroots B∨ indeed form a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the set of simple coroots \( B^\vee = \{\alpha_1^\vee, \ldots, \alpha_l^\vee\} \) forms a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \), we need to verify if \( B^\vee \) satisfies the properties of a base in the dual root system. 

1. **Hyperplanes and Chambers**: The hyperplanes for the dual root system \( R^\vee \) are the same as those for the original root system \( R \). This is because the coroot of a coroot \( (\alpha^\vee)^\vee \) is the original root \( \alpha \). Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of these hyperplanes, are the same for both \( R \) and \( R^\vee \).

2. **Base Definition**: A base for a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of these simple roots with all coefficients integers of the same sign. For \( B^\vee \) to be a base for \( R^\vee \), every coroot \( \beta^\vee \in R^\vee \) must be expressible as a non-negative or non-positive integer combination of the simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \).

3. **Duality Relationship**: The dual root system \( R^\vee \) consists of coroots \( \alpha^\vee \) for each root \( \alpha \in R \). The simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \) are scaled versions of the simple roots \( \alpha_i \). For a chamber \( C \), the base \( B \) of \( R \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i^\vee \rangle &gt; 0 \). For the dual root system \( R^\vee \), the same chamber \( C \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i \rangle &gt; 0 \), which is equivalent due to the scaling relationship between roots and coroots.

4. **Verification with Examples**: Checking examples such as \( A_1 \), \( A_2 \), \( B_2 \), and \( G_2 \) confirms that the simple coroots form a base for the dual root system. In each case, the simple coroots correspond to the simple roots of the dual system, ensuring that all positive coroots in \( R^\vee \) are non-negative combinations of the simple coroots.

Thus, the set \( B^\vee \) of simple coroots is indeed a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the set of simple coroots B∨ is always a base for the dual root system R∨. Let me start by recalling some definitions and properties related to root systems, dual root systems, chambers, and bases. 

First, a root system (V, R) consists of a finite set R of non-zero vectors (roots) in a Euclidean space V that satisfy certain axioms, like being closed under reflections and having rational Cartan numbers. The dual root system (V∨, R∨) is formed by taking the coroots α∨ = 2α/(α, α) for each root α in R. 

A chamber C, also known as a Weyl chamber, is a connected component of the complement in V of all the hyperplanes Hα = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0}. Each chamber is an open convex cone, and the group generated by the reflections over the hyperplanes Hα (the Weyl group) acts simply transitively on the chambers. 

For a given chamber C, the corresponding base B = B(C) is the unique set of simple roots {α1, ..., αl} such that C is defined by the intersection of the positive half-spaces determined by the simple roots. That is, C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. The simple roots form a basis of the vector space V and also a basis over the integers for the root lattice. 

Now, the question is whether the set B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} of simple coroots forms a base for the dual root system R∨. To check this, I need to verify if B∨ satisfies the properties of a base when considered in the dual root system. 

A base of a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of the base elements with all coefficients integers of the same sign (either all non-negative or all non-positive). So, for B∨ to be a base of R∨, every coroot β∨ in R∨ should be expressible as a linear combination of the αi∨ with coefficients all non-negative or all non-negative integers. 

First, note that the coroots α∨ are themselves roots in the dual root system R∨. So, B∨ is a subset of R∨. The key point is whether B∨ is a base in the sense of root systems for R∨. 

Given that dual root systems have a duality relationship, I suspect that the simple coroots should form a base for the dual system. However, I need to confirm this carefully. 

Let me recall that in the original root system R, the simple roots B = {α1, ..., αl} form a basis for V and define the positive roots R+ as those roots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple roots. Similarly, the positive coroots R∨+ would be those coroots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple coroots B∨. 

But wait, the coroot of a positive root is not necessarily a positive coroot. Let me check: If β is a positive root in R, then β = Σ niαi with ni ≥ 0. Then β∨ = 2β/(β, β). But how does this relate to the simple coroots? 

Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is that the dual root system R∨ has its own set of simple roots, which may or may not coincide with the simple coroots. 

Alternatively, since the dual of a root system is another root system, with the roles of roots and coroots swapped, perhaps the simple coroots in the original system correspond to the simple roots in the dual system. 

Wait, the coroot system R∨ is a root system in V∨, which is the dual space of V. But if V is equipped with an inner product, we can identify V with V∨, so perhaps they are considered in the same space. Wait, but actually, the coroot α∨ is defined as 2α/(α, α), so if we have a root α in V, then α∨ is in V as well, scaled by 2/(α, α). So the dual root system R∨ is in the same space V, not the dual space. That seems right because the definition of root systems usually includes being in a Euclidean space, and the dual roots are scaled versions. 

Therefore, R∨ is a root system in V, same as R. So the chambers for R∨ would be connected components of V minus the hyperplanes Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, (α∨)∨⟩ = 0}. But (α∨)∨ is equal to α, since the coroot of a coroot is the original root. So Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α⟩ = 0} = Hα. Wait, so the hyperplanes for R∨ are the same as the hyperplanes for R? 

Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s check. For the dual root system R∨, the hyperplanes would be Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β∨∨⟩ = 0}. But β∨ is a root in R∨, so (β∨)∨ = β∨∨ = 2β∨/(β∨, β∨). But β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = 2*(2β/(β, β)) / (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)).

Calculating the inner product in the denominator: (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)) = 4/(β, β)^2 * (β, β) = 4/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = (4β/(β, β)) / (4/(β, β)) ) = β. 

Hence, (β∨)∨ = β. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β⟩ = 0}, which are exactly the same as the hyperplanes Hβ for the original root system R. 

Therefore, the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same. Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of the hyperplanes, are the same for both root systems. 

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. If the hyperplanes are the same, then the chambers are the same. So a chamber C for R is also a chamber for R∨. 

But then, the base B(C) for R is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for each αi in B. Similarly, the base for R∨ corresponding to the same chamber C would be the set of simple roots for R∨, which are the simple coroots? Wait, but the simple roots for R∨ would be the set B∨?

But if the chambers are the same, then the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C should be the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of their positive half-spaces. But in R∨, the positive half-spaces are defined by ⟨x, β∨⟩ &gt; 0 for β∨ in R∨. But since β∨∨ = β, this is equivalent to ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. Wait, but in the original root system, the hyperplanes are defined by ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0. So the positive half-spaces for R∨ would be defined by ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0, where β is a root in R. But these are the same as the positive half-spaces for R, except that in R, the half-spaces are ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let&#x27;s clarify.

In the original root system R, the simple roots α1, ..., αl are such that the chamber C is the set of x in V where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

In the dual root system R∨, the roots are the coroots α∨ for α in R. The chamber for R∨ would be defined in terms of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots in R∨, which are the same hyperplanes as in R. So the chambers for R and R∨ are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the unique set of simple roots β1∨, ..., βl∨ in R∨ such that C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. But since βi∨∨ = βi, this is equivalent to C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. Therefore, in order for B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} to be the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C, we need that C is the set of x where ⟨x, αi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. But since αi∨∨ = αi, this would mean C is the set where ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

However, in the original definition, C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, unless ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is not generally true, these conditions are different. 

Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me check with an example. Let&#x27;s take the root system A1, which is just {α, -α}, with α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If we take the chamber C to be the positive half-line where ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, α⟩ &gt; 0 since α∨ is a positive multiple of α. So in this case, the chamber C is the same whether we use α or α∨. Hence, in this case, the simple coroot α∨ would generate the same chamber as α. 

But wait, in this case, since A1 is self-dual (since α∨ is just a scalar multiple of α), the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, the base for R∨ would just be the same as the base for R. 

But in higher rank root systems, perhaps this is different. Let&#x27;s consider the root system A2, which consists of the roots in the two-dimensional space with simple roots α1 and α2 at 120 degrees. The coroots α1∨ and α2∨ are scaled versions of α1 and α2. Specifically, if α1 and α2 have the same length, then the coroots would be the same roots scaled by 2/(α, α). For example, in the standard normalization where (α, α) = 2, the coroot α∨ is equal to α. But if (α, α) = 1, then α∨ = 2α. 

Wait, in the root system A2, all roots have the same length. Let&#x27;s say the roots are vectors in Euclidean space with length √2, so that (α, α) = 2. Then α∨ = 2α/(α, α) = α. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, in this case, the simple coroots are the same as the simple roots, so B∨ = B, and hence B∨ is a base for R∨, which is R itself. So in this case, yes, B∨ is a base. 

But suppose we have a root system where roots have different lengths, say B2 or G2. Let&#x27;s take B2. In B2, there are long and short roots. Let me recall that in B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The coroots would be α∨ = 2α/(α, α) and β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Since α is long, (α, α) is larger than (β, β). For example, in B2, we can take α = e1 - e2 and β = e2, with (α, α) = 2 and (β, β) = 1. Then α∨ = 2α/2 = α, and β∨ = 2β/1 = 2β. So the coroots in B2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ consists of the roots α and 2β and their negatives, which is actually the root system C2. 

So, in this case, R∨ is of type C2, and the simple coroots for B2 are α and 2β. But in the dual root system C2, the simple roots are different. Wait, the dual root system of B2 is C2, where the simple roots are the coroots of B2. However, in C2, the simple roots are the coroots of B2, so the simple roots for C2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the base B∨ = {α, 2β} is indeed the base for the dual root system C2. 

Wait, but in C2, the simple roots are usually denoted as γ1 and γ2, where γ1 is long and γ2 is short. But in our case, if B2 has simple roots α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ = α and β∨ = 2β, which are the simple roots for C2. Therefore, B∨ is indeed a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in this case, the answer is yes. But let me verify another example. Take G2, which is more complicated. In G2, there are long and short roots, with the ratio of squared lengths being 3. The dual root system of G2 is still G2, since it is self-dual. Wait, but actually, in G2, the roots and coroots have the same length ratio because the ratio of the squares is 3, so when you take coroots, you invert the scaling. Wait, if α is a long root with (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2α/3, and if β is a short root with (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β. So the dual root system would consist of roots 2α/3 and 2β. But is this isomorphic to G2? Wait, G2 is self-dual because the dual of a root system is determined by the inverse of the Cartan matrix, and G2 is simply-laced in some sense? No, G2 is not simply-laced. Wait, maybe it&#x27;s self-dual. Let me recall that in G2, the Cartan matrix is:

[ 2 -3 ]

[-1 2 ]

The inverse of this matrix is:

[2  3]

[1  2] 

divided by determinant, which is 4 - 3 = 1. So the inverse Cartan matrix is the same as the transpose, which would be the Cartan matrix of the dual root system. But since the inverse is not the same as the original, unless we rescale. Wait, but since the Cartan matrix for the dual root system is the transpose of the original Cartan matrix, which for G2 is not symmetric. Wait, but in G2, the Cartan matrix is not symmetric, so its dual root system would have the transpose Cartan matrix, which would correspond to swapping the roots. But in G2, the roots have different lengths, so the dual root system would have the Cartan matrix with entries swapped. However, since G2 is its own dual under the scaling of roots. Let me check if the dual root system is isomorphic to G2.

Wait, if the original roots are long and short, then the coroots would be short and long, respectively. Because α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If α is long, say (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2/3 α, which would be a shorter root. If β is short, (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β, which is longer. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ would have roots that are the coroots of R, which in G2 case are scaled such that the long roots become short and vice versa. But since G2 is self-dual in the sense that the dual root system is isomorphic to the original, just with roots scaled. Therefore, R∨ is isomorphic to R, so the base B∨ would correspond to the base of R∨, which is isomorphic, so yes, B∨ is a base. 

Wait, but if we take the simple roots in G2 as α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ (short) and β∨ (long). Then B∨ would consist of a short root and a long root. In the dual root system R∨, which is isomorphic to G2, the simple roots are these coroots. So, in effect, the base B∨ is a set of simple roots for R∨, which is isomorphic to G2. Therefore, yes, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in all these examples, the set of simple coroots B∨ is indeed a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, perhaps the answer is yes. But I need to ensure there isn&#x27;t some root system where this fails. 

Alternatively, let&#x27;s think abstractly. Since the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same, the chambers are the same. The base for R corresponding to chamber C is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. The base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the set of simple roots δ1, ..., δl in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, δi∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δi∨ = δi (since for R∨, the coroots are the original roots). Wait, no. Wait, in the dual root system R∨, the coroots are (α∨)∨ = α. So if we take R∨, its coroots are the original roots. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = 0} where δ is a root in R∨, i.e., δ = α∨ for some α in R. But δ∨ = (α∨)∨ = α. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = Hα, which are the same as hyperplanes for R. Therefore, as before, chambers are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for those roots. But in R∨, the positive half-space for a root δ ∈ R∨ is defined by ⟨x, δ∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δ ∈ R∨ means δ = β∨ for some β ∈ R. Therefore, ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = ⟨x, (β∨)∨⟩ = ⟨x, β⟩. Therefore, the positive half-space for δ = β∨ is ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all simple roots αi. So if we want the base for R∨, we need the simple roots δj in R∨ such that ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 defines C. But δj∨ = βj, so this becomes ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original system, the chamber C is also defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, if the set of βj is such that ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, then βj must be related to αi∨. 

Wait, this seems a bit circular. Let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have the chamber C. For the original root system R, the simple roots αi are the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. For the dual root system R∨, the simple roots δj must be the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δj∨ is in R, since δj is in R∨. So δj∨ = αj. Therefore, the condition ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, for the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. But in the original system, C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Therefore, unless ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 and ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 define the same chamber, which is only the case if αj and αj∨ are scalar multiples. But αj∨ = 2αj/(αj, αj). Therefore, αj∨ is a scalar multiple of αj. Hence, the half-space ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is the same as ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 if and only if the scalar is positive, which it is. Since 2/(αj, αj) is positive, then yes, ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the chamber C is defined equivalently by either ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 or ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, in the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the set of simple roots for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the set of δj such that δj∨ = αj, which implies δj = αj∨. Therefore, the simple roots for R∨ are exactly the simple coroots B∨. 

Therefore, this shows that the set B∨ is indeed the base for the dual root system R∨ corresponding to the chamber C. 

Thus, in general, the simple coroots B∨ form a base for the dual root system R∨. 

But let me verify once again. Suppose that in the dual root system R∨, the simple roots are the simple coroots of R. Then the positive coroots in R∨ would be the non-negative linear combinations of the simple coroots. But in R∨, the roots are the coroots of R, so the positive coroots would correspond to the positive roots in R∨. But a positive root in R∨ is a coroot that is a non-negative combination of the simple coroots. However, in the original system, the positive roots are non-negative combinations of the simple roots. There&#x27;s a duality here. 

For example, in the original root system, a positive root is a sum of simple roots with non-negative coefficients. The coroot of a positive root is a positive coroot, but the positive coroots are not necessarily the same as the non-negative combinations of simple coroots. Wait, but if B∨ is a base for R∨, then every positive coroot in R∨ is a non-negative combination of B∨. Let me check with B2 example. 

In B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The positive roots are α, β, α + β, α + 2β. The coroots would be α∨ = α, β∨ = 2β. The positive coroots are α, 2β, α + 2β, 2α + 4β. Wait, no. Wait, the coroots of the roots are:

For α: α∨ = α.

For β: β∨ = 2β.

For α + β: (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/(α + β, α + β). Let&#x27;s compute (α + β, α + β) = (α, α) + 2(α, β) + (β, β). In B2, (α, α) = 2, (β, β) = 1, and (α, β) = -1. Therefore, (α + β, α + β) = 2 + 2*(-1) + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Therefore, (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/1 = 2α + 2β.

Similarly, for α + 2β: (α + 2β, α + 2β) = (α, α) + 4(α, β) + 4(β, β) = 2 + 4*(-1) + 4*1 = 2 -4 +4 = 2. Therefore, (α + 2β)∨ = 2(α + 2β)/2 = α + 2β.

Therefore, the positive coroots in R∨ are α, 2β, 2α + 2β, and α + 2β. 

Now, the simple coroots B∨ = {α∨, β∨} = {α, 2β}. The positive coroots in R∨ should be the non-negative combinations of α and 2β. Let&#x27;s see:

- α is a non-negative combination of α and 2β (1*α + 0*2β).
- 2β is 0*α + 1*2β.
- 2α + 2β is 2*α + 1*2β.
- α + 2β is 1*α + 1*2β.

Therefore, all positive coroots in R∨ are indeed non-negative combinations of the simple coroots B∨. Therefore, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Similarly, if we take a positive coroot like 2α + 2β, which is not a coroot of a simple root, but it is a combination of the simple coroots. Therefore, B∨ satisfies the conditions of a base. 

Hence, through these examples and abstract reasoning, it seems that the simple coroots B∨ indeed form a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the set of simple coroots \( B^\vee = \{\alpha_1^\vee, \ldots, \alpha_l^\vee\} \) forms a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \), we need to verify if \( B^\vee \) satisfies the properties of a base in the dual root system. 

1. **Hyperplanes and Chambers**: The hyperplanes for the dual root system \( R^\vee \) are the same as those for the original root system \( R \). This is because the coroot of a coroot \( (\alpha^\vee)^\vee \) is the original root \( \alpha \). Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of these hyperplanes, are the same for both \( R \) and \( R^\vee \).

2. **Base Definition**: A base for a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of these simple roots with all coefficients integers of the same sign. For \( B^\vee \) to be a base for \( R^\vee \), every coroot \( \beta^\vee \in R^\vee \) must be expressible as a non-negative or non-positive integer combination of the simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \).

3. **Duality Relationship**: The dual root system \( R^\vee \) consists of coroots \( \alpha^\vee \) for each root \( \alpha \in R \). The simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \) are scaled versions of the simple roots \( \alpha_i \). For a chamber \( C \), the base \( B \) of \( R \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i^\vee \rangle &gt; 0 \). For the dual root system \( R^\vee \), the same chamber \( C \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i \rangle &gt; 0 \), which is equivalent due to the scaling relationship between roots and coroots.

4. **Verification with Examples**: Checking examples such as \( A_1 \), \( A_2 \), \( B_2 \), and \( G_2 \) confirms that the simple coroots form a base for the dual root system. In each case, the simple coroots correspond to the simple roots of the dual system, ensuring that all positive coroots in \( R^\vee \) are non-negative combinations of the simple coroots.

Thus, the set \( B^\vee \) of simple coroots is indeed a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the set of simple coroots B∨ is always a base for the dual root system R∨. Let me start by recalling some definitions and properties related to root systems, dual root systems, chambers, and bases. 

First, a root system (V, R) consists of a finite set R of non-zero vectors (roots) in a Euclidean space V that satisfy certain axioms, like being closed under reflections and having rational Cartan numbers. The dual root system (V∨, R∨) is formed by taking the coroots α∨ = 2α/(α, α) for each root α in R. 

A chamber C, also known as a Weyl chamber, is a connected component of the complement in V of all the hyperplanes Hα = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0}. Each chamber is an open convex cone, and the group generated by the reflections over the hyperplanes Hα (the Weyl group) acts simply transitively on the chambers. 

For a given chamber C, the corresponding base B = B(C) is the unique set of simple roots {α1, ..., αl} such that C is defined by the intersection of the positive half-spaces determined by the simple roots. That is, C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. The simple roots form a basis of the vector space V and also a basis over the integers for the root lattice. 

Now, the question is whether the set B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} of simple coroots forms a base for the dual root system R∨. To check this, I need to verify if B∨ satisfies the properties of a base when considered in the dual root system. 

A base of a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of the base elements with all coefficients integers of the same sign (either all non-negative or all non-positive). So, for B∨ to be a base of R∨, every coroot β∨ in R∨ should be expressible as a linear combination of the αi∨ with coefficients all non-negative or all non-negative integers. 

First, note that the coroots α∨ are themselves roots in the dual root system R∨. So, B∨ is a subset of R∨. The key point is whether B∨ is a base in the sense of root systems for R∨. 

Given that dual root systems have a duality relationship, I suspect that the simple coroots should form a base for the dual system. However, I need to confirm this carefully. 

Let me recall that in the original root system R, the simple roots B = {α1, ..., αl} form a basis for V and define the positive roots R+ as those roots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple roots. Similarly, the positive coroots R∨+ would be those coroots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple coroots B∨. 

But wait, the coroot of a positive root is not necessarily a positive coroot. Let me check: If β is a positive root in R, then β = Σ niαi with ni ≥ 0. Then β∨ = 2β/(β, β). But how does this relate to the simple coroots? 

Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is that the dual root system R∨ has its own set of simple roots, which may or may not coincide with the simple coroots. 

Alternatively, since the dual of a root system is another root system, with the roles of roots and coroots swapped, perhaps the simple coroots in the original system correspond to the simple roots in the dual system. 

Wait, the coroot system R∨ is a root system in V∨, which is the dual space of V. But if V is equipped with an inner product, we can identify V with V∨, so perhaps they are considered in the same space. Wait, but actually, the coroot α∨ is defined as 2α/(α, α), so if we have a root α in V, then α∨ is in V as well, scaled by 2/(α, α). So the dual root system R∨ is in the same space V, not the dual space. That seems right because the definition of root systems usually includes being in a Euclidean space, and the dual roots are scaled versions. 

Therefore, R∨ is a root system in V, same as R. So the chambers for R∨ would be connected components of V minus the hyperplanes Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, (α∨)∨⟩ = 0}. But (α∨)∨ is equal to α, since the coroot of a coroot is the original root. So Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α⟩ = 0} = Hα. Wait, so the hyperplanes for R∨ are the same as the hyperplanes for R? 

Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s check. For the dual root system R∨, the hyperplanes would be Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β∨∨⟩ = 0}. But β∨ is a root in R∨, so (β∨)∨ = β∨∨ = 2β∨/(β∨, β∨). But β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = 2*(2β/(β, β)) / (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)).

Calculating the inner product in the denominator: (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)) = 4/(β, β)^2 * (β, β) = 4/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = (4β/(β, β)) / (4/(β, β)) ) = β. 

Hence, (β∨)∨ = β. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β⟩ = 0}, which are exactly the same as the hyperplanes Hβ for the original root system R. 

Therefore, the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same. Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of the hyperplanes, are the same for both root systems. 

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. If the hyperplanes are the same, then the chambers are the same. So a chamber C for R is also a chamber for R∨. 

But then, the base B(C) for R is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for each αi in B. Similarly, the base for R∨ corresponding to the same chamber C would be the set of simple roots for R∨, which are the simple coroots? Wait, but the simple roots for R∨ would be the set B∨?

But if the chambers are the same, then the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C should be the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of their positive half-spaces. But in R∨, the positive half-spaces are defined by ⟨x, β∨⟩ &gt; 0 for β∨ in R∨. But since β∨∨ = β, this is equivalent to ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. Wait, but in the original root system, the hyperplanes are defined by ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0. So the positive half-spaces for R∨ would be defined by ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0, where β is a root in R. But these are the same as the positive half-spaces for R, except that in R, the half-spaces are ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let&#x27;s clarify.

In the original root system R, the simple roots α1, ..., αl are such that the chamber C is the set of x in V where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

In the dual root system R∨, the roots are the coroots α∨ for α in R. The chamber for R∨ would be defined in terms of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots in R∨, which are the same hyperplanes as in R. So the chambers for R and R∨ are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the unique set of simple roots β1∨, ..., βl∨ in R∨ such that C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. But since βi∨∨ = βi, this is equivalent to C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. Therefore, in order for B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} to be the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C, we need that C is the set of x where ⟨x, αi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. But since αi∨∨ = αi, this would mean C is the set where ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

However, in the original definition, C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, unless ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is not generally true, these conditions are different. 

Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me check with an example. Let&#x27;s take the root system A1, which is just {α, -α}, with α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If we take the chamber C to be the positive half-line where ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, α⟩ &gt; 0 since α∨ is a positive multiple of α. So in this case, the chamber C is the same whether we use α or α∨. Hence, in this case, the simple coroot α∨ would generate the same chamber as α. 

But wait, in this case, since A1 is self-dual (since α∨ is just a scalar multiple of α), the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, the base for R∨ would just be the same as the base for R. 

But in higher rank root systems, perhaps this is different. Let&#x27;s consider the root system A2, which consists of the roots in the two-dimensional space with simple roots α1 and α2 at 120 degrees. The coroots α1∨ and α2∨ are scaled versions of α1 and α2. Specifically, if α1 and α2 have the same length, then the coroots would be the same roots scaled by 2/(α, α). For example, in the standard normalization where (α, α) = 2, the coroot α∨ is equal to α. But if (α, α) = 1, then α∨ = 2α. 

Wait, in the root system A2, all roots have the same length. Let&#x27;s say the roots are vectors in Euclidean space with length √2, so that (α, α) = 2. Then α∨ = 2α/(α, α) = α. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, in this case, the simple coroots are the same as the simple roots, so B∨ = B, and hence B∨ is a base for R∨, which is R itself. So in this case, yes, B∨ is a base. 

But suppose we have a root system where roots have different lengths, say B2 or G2. Let&#x27;s take B2. In B2, there are long and short roots. Let me recall that in B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The coroots would be α∨ = 2α/(α, α) and β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Since α is long, (α, α) is larger than (β, β). For example, in B2, we can take α = e1 - e2 and β = e2, with (α, α) = 2 and (β, β) = 1. Then α∨ = 2α/2 = α, and β∨ = 2β/1 = 2β. So the coroots in B2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ consists of the roots α and 2β and their negatives, which is actually the root system C2. 

So, in this case, R∨ is of type C2, and the simple coroots for B2 are α and 2β. But in the dual root system C2, the simple roots are different. Wait, the dual root system of B2 is C2, where the simple roots are the coroots of B2. However, in C2, the simple roots are the coroots of B2, so the simple roots for C2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the base B∨ = {α, 2β} is indeed the base for the dual root system C2. 

Wait, but in C2, the simple roots are usually denoted as γ1 and γ2, where γ1 is long and γ2 is short. But in our case, if B2 has simple roots α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ = α and β∨ = 2β, which are the simple roots for C2. Therefore, B∨ is indeed a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in this case, the answer is yes. But let me verify another example. Take G2, which is more complicated. In G2, there are long and short roots, with the ratio of squared lengths being 3. The dual root system of G2 is still G2, since it is self-dual. Wait, but actually, in G2, the roots and coroots have the same length ratio because the ratio of the squares is 3, so when you take coroots, you invert the scaling. Wait, if α is a long root with (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2α/3, and if β is a short root with (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β. So the dual root system would consist of roots 2α/3 and 2β. But is this isomorphic to G2? Wait, G2 is self-dual because the dual of a root system is determined by the inverse of the Cartan matrix, and G2 is simply-laced in some sense? No, G2 is not simply-laced. Wait, maybe it&#x27;s self-dual. Let me recall that in G2, the Cartan matrix is:

[ 2 -3 ]

[-1 2 ]

The inverse of this matrix is:

[2  3]

[1  2] 

divided by determinant, which is 4 - 3 = 1. So the inverse Cartan matrix is the same as the transpose, which would be the Cartan matrix of the dual root system. But since the inverse is not the same as the original, unless we rescale. Wait, but since the Cartan matrix for the dual root system is the transpose of the original Cartan matrix, which for G2 is not symmetric. Wait, but in G2, the Cartan matrix is not symmetric, so its dual root system would have the transpose Cartan matrix, which would correspond to swapping the roots. But in G2, the roots have different lengths, so the dual root system would have the Cartan matrix with entries swapped. However, since G2 is its own dual under the scaling of roots. Let me check if the dual root system is isomorphic to G2.

Wait, if the original roots are long and short, then the coroots would be short and long, respectively. Because α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If α is long, say (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2/3 α, which would be a shorter root. If β is short, (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β, which is longer. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ would have roots that are the coroots of R, which in G2 case are scaled such that the long roots become short and vice versa. But since G2 is self-dual in the sense that the dual root system is isomorphic to the original, just with roots scaled. Therefore, R∨ is isomorphic to R, so the base B∨ would correspond to the base of R∨, which is isomorphic, so yes, B∨ is a base. 

Wait, but if we take the simple roots in G2 as α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ (short) and β∨ (long). Then B∨ would consist of a short root and a long root. In the dual root system R∨, which is isomorphic to G2, the simple roots are these coroots. So, in effect, the base B∨ is a set of simple roots for R∨, which is isomorphic to G2. Therefore, yes, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in all these examples, the set of simple coroots B∨ is indeed a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, perhaps the answer is yes. But I need to ensure there isn&#x27;t some root system where this fails. 

Alternatively, let&#x27;s think abstractly. Since the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same, the chambers are the same. The base for R corresponding to chamber C is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. The base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the set of simple roots δ1, ..., δl in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, δi∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δi∨ = δi (since for R∨, the coroots are the original roots). Wait, no. Wait, in the dual root system R∨, the coroots are (α∨)∨ = α. So if we take R∨, its coroots are the original roots. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = 0} where δ is a root in R∨, i.e., δ = α∨ for some α in R. But δ∨ = (α∨)∨ = α. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = Hα, which are the same as hyperplanes for R. Therefore, as before, chambers are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for those roots. But in R∨, the positive half-space for a root δ ∈ R∨ is defined by ⟨x, δ∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δ ∈ R∨ means δ = β∨ for some β ∈ R. Therefore, ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = ⟨x, (β∨)∨⟩ = ⟨x, β⟩. Therefore, the positive half-space for δ = β∨ is ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all simple roots αi. So if we want the base for R∨, we need the simple roots δj in R∨ such that ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 defines C. But δj∨ = βj, so this becomes ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original system, the chamber C is also defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, if the set of βj is such that ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, then βj must be related to αi∨. 

Wait, this seems a bit circular. Let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have the chamber C. For the original root system R, the simple roots αi are the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. For the dual root system R∨, the simple roots δj must be the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δj∨ is in R, since δj is in R∨. So δj∨ = αj. Therefore, the condition ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, for the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. But in the original system, C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Therefore, unless ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 and ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 define the same chamber, which is only the case if αj and αj∨ are scalar multiples. But αj∨ = 2αj/(αj, αj). Therefore, αj∨ is a scalar multiple of αj. Hence, the half-space ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is the same as ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 if and only if the scalar is positive, which it is. Since 2/(αj, αj) is positive, then yes, ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the chamber C is defined equivalently by either ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 or ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, in the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the set of simple roots for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the set of δj such that δj∨ = αj, which implies δj = αj∨. Therefore, the simple roots for R∨ are exactly the simple coroots B∨. 

Therefore, this shows that the set B∨ is indeed the base for the dual root system R∨ corresponding to the chamber C. 

Thus, in general, the simple coroots B∨ form a base for the dual root system R∨. 

But let me verify once again. Suppose that in the dual root system R∨, the simple roots are the simple coroots of R. Then the positive coroots in R∨ would be the non-negative linear combinations of the simple coroots. But in R∨, the roots are the coroots of R, so the positive coroots would correspond to the positive roots in R∨. But a positive root in R∨ is a coroot that is a non-negative combination of the simple coroots. However, in the original system, the positive roots are non-negative combinations of the simple roots. There&#x27;s a duality here. 

For example, in the original root system, a positive root is a sum of simple roots with non-negative coefficients. The coroot of a positive root is a positive coroot, but the positive coroots are not necessarily the same as the non-negative combinations of simple coroots. Wait, but if B∨ is a base for R∨, then every positive coroot in R∨ is a non-negative combination of B∨. Let me check with B2 example. 

In B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The positive roots are α, β, α + β, α + 2β. The coroots would be α∨ = α, β∨ = 2β. The positive coroots are α, 2β, α + 2β, 2α + 4β. Wait, no. Wait, the coroots of the roots are:

For α: α∨ = α.

For β: β∨ = 2β.

For α + β: (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/(α + β, α + β). Let&#x27;s compute (α + β, α + β) = (α, α) + 2(α, β) + (β, β). In B2, (α, α) = 2, (β, β) = 1, and (α, β) = -1. Therefore, (α + β, α + β) = 2 + 2*(-1) + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Therefore, (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/1 = 2α + 2β.

Similarly, for α + 2β: (α + 2β, α + 2β) = (α, α) + 4(α, β) + 4(β, β) = 2 + 4*(-1) + 4*1 = 2 -4 +4 = 2. Therefore, (α + 2β)∨ = 2(α + 2β)/2 = α + 2β.

Therefore, the positive coroots in R∨ are α, 2β, 2α + 2β, and α + 2β. 

Now, the simple coroots B∨ = {α∨, β∨} = {α, 2β}. The positive coroots in R∨ should be the non-negative combinations of α and 2β. Let&#x27;s see:

- α is a non-negative combination of α and 2β (1*α + 0*2β).
- 2β is 0*α + 1*2β.
- 2α + 2β is 2*α + 1*2β.
- α + 2β is 1*α + 1*2β.

Therefore, all positive coroots in R∨ are indeed non-negative combinations of the simple coroots B∨. Therefore, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Similarly, if we take a positive coroot like 2α + 2β, which is not a coroot of a simple root, but it is a combination of the simple coroots. Therefore, B∨ satisfies the conditions of a base. 

Hence, through these examples and abstract reasoning, it seems that the simple coroots B∨ indeed form a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the set of simple coroots \( B^\vee = \{\alpha_1^\vee, \ldots, \alpha_l^\vee\} \) forms a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \), we need to verify if \( B^\vee \) satisfies the properties of a base in the dual root system. 

1. **Hyperplanes and Chambers**: The hyperplanes for the dual root system \( R^\vee \) are the same as those for the original root system \( R \). This is because the coroot of a coroot \( (\alpha^\vee)^\vee \) is the original root \( \alpha \). Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of these hyperplanes, are the same for both \( R \) and \( R^\vee \).

2. **Base Definition**: A base for a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of these simple roots with all coefficients integers of the same sign. For \( B^\vee \) to be a base for \( R^\vee \), every coroot \( \beta^\vee \in R^\vee \) must be expressible as a non-negative or non-positive integer combination of the simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \).

3. **Duality Relationship**: The dual root system \( R^\vee \) consists of coroots \( \alpha^\vee \) for each root \( \alpha \in R \). The simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \) are scaled versions of the simple roots \( \alpha_i \). For a chamber \( C \), the base \( B \) of \( R \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i^\vee \rangle &gt; 0 \). For the dual root system \( R^\vee \), the same chamber \( C \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i \rangle &gt; 0 \), which is equivalent due to the scaling relationship between roots and coroots.

4. **Verification with Examples**: Checking examples such as \( A_1 \), \( A_2 \), \( B_2 \), and \( G_2 \) confirms that the simple coroots form a base for the dual root system. In each case, the simple coroots correspond to the simple roots of the dual system, ensuring that all positive coroots in \( R^\vee \) are non-negative combinations of the simple coroots.

Thus, the set \( B^\vee \) of simple coroots is indeed a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the set of simple coroots B∨ is always a base for the dual root system R∨. Let me start by recalling some definitions and properties related to root systems, dual root systems, chambers, and bases. 

First, a root system (V, R) consists of a finite set R of non-zero vectors (roots) in a Euclidean space V that satisfy certain axioms, like being closed under reflections and having rational Cartan numbers. The dual root system (V∨, R∨) is formed by taking the coroots α∨ = 2α/(α, α) for each root α in R. 

A chamber C, also known as a Weyl chamber, is a connected component of the complement in V of all the hyperplanes Hα = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0}. Each chamber is an open convex cone, and the group generated by the reflections over the hyperplanes Hα (the Weyl group) acts simply transitively on the chambers. 

For a given chamber C, the corresponding base B = B(C) is the unique set of simple roots {α1, ..., αl} such that C is defined by the intersection of the positive half-spaces determined by the simple roots. That is, C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. The simple roots form a basis of the vector space V and also a basis over the integers for the root lattice. 

Now, the question is whether the set B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} of simple coroots forms a base for the dual root system R∨. To check this, I need to verify if B∨ satisfies the properties of a base when considered in the dual root system. 

A base of a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of the base elements with all coefficients integers of the same sign (either all non-negative or all non-positive). So, for B∨ to be a base of R∨, every coroot β∨ in R∨ should be expressible as a linear combination of the αi∨ with coefficients all non-negative or all non-negative integers. 

First, note that the coroots α∨ are themselves roots in the dual root system R∨. So, B∨ is a subset of R∨. The key point is whether B∨ is a base in the sense of root systems for R∨. 

Given that dual root systems have a duality relationship, I suspect that the simple coroots should form a base for the dual system. However, I need to confirm this carefully. 

Let me recall that in the original root system R, the simple roots B = {α1, ..., αl} form a basis for V and define the positive roots R+ as those roots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple roots. Similarly, the positive coroots R∨+ would be those coroots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple coroots B∨. 

But wait, the coroot of a positive root is not necessarily a positive coroot. Let me check: If β is a positive root in R, then β = Σ niαi with ni ≥ 0. Then β∨ = 2β/(β, β). But how does this relate to the simple coroots? 

Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is that the dual root system R∨ has its own set of simple roots, which may or may not coincide with the simple coroots. 

Alternatively, since the dual of a root system is another root system, with the roles of roots and coroots swapped, perhaps the simple coroots in the original system correspond to the simple roots in the dual system. 

Wait, the coroot system R∨ is a root system in V∨, which is the dual space of V. But if V is equipped with an inner product, we can identify V with V∨, so perhaps they are considered in the same space. Wait, but actually, the coroot α∨ is defined as 2α/(α, α), so if we have a root α in V, then α∨ is in V as well, scaled by 2/(α, α). So the dual root system R∨ is in the same space V, not the dual space. That seems right because the definition of root systems usually includes being in a Euclidean space, and the dual roots are scaled versions. 

Therefore, R∨ is a root system in V, same as R. So the chambers for R∨ would be connected components of V minus the hyperplanes Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, (α∨)∨⟩ = 0}. But (α∨)∨ is equal to α, since the coroot of a coroot is the original root. So Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α⟩ = 0} = Hα. Wait, so the hyperplanes for R∨ are the same as the hyperplanes for R? 

Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s check. For the dual root system R∨, the hyperplanes would be Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β∨∨⟩ = 0}. But β∨ is a root in R∨, so (β∨)∨ = β∨∨ = 2β∨/(β∨, β∨). But β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = 2*(2β/(β, β)) / (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)).

Calculating the inner product in the denominator: (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)) = 4/(β, β)^2 * (β, β) = 4/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = (4β/(β, β)) / (4/(β, β)) ) = β. 

Hence, (β∨)∨ = β. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β⟩ = 0}, which are exactly the same as the hyperplanes Hβ for the original root system R. 

Therefore, the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same. Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of the hyperplanes, are the same for both root systems. 

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. If the hyperplanes are the same, then the chambers are the same. So a chamber C for R is also a chamber for R∨. 

But then, the base B(C) for R is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for each αi in B. Similarly, the base for R∨ corresponding to the same chamber C would be the set of simple roots for R∨, which are the simple coroots? Wait, but the simple roots for R∨ would be the set B∨?

But if the chambers are the same, then the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C should be the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of their positive half-spaces. But in R∨, the positive half-spaces are defined by ⟨x, β∨⟩ &gt; 0 for β∨ in R∨. But since β∨∨ = β, this is equivalent to ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. Wait, but in the original root system, the hyperplanes are defined by ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0. So the positive half-spaces for R∨ would be defined by ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0, where β is a root in R. But these are the same as the positive half-spaces for R, except that in R, the half-spaces are ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let&#x27;s clarify.

In the original root system R, the simple roots α1, ..., αl are such that the chamber C is the set of x in V where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

In the dual root system R∨, the roots are the coroots α∨ for α in R. The chamber for R∨ would be defined in terms of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots in R∨, which are the same hyperplanes as in R. So the chambers for R and R∨ are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the unique set of simple roots β1∨, ..., βl∨ in R∨ such that C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. But since βi∨∨ = βi, this is equivalent to C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. Therefore, in order for B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} to be the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C, we need that C is the set of x where ⟨x, αi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. But since αi∨∨ = αi, this would mean C is the set where ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

However, in the original definition, C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, unless ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is not generally true, these conditions are different. 

Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me check with an example. Let&#x27;s take the root system A1, which is just {α, -α}, with α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If we take the chamber C to be the positive half-line where ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, α⟩ &gt; 0 since α∨ is a positive multiple of α. So in this case, the chamber C is the same whether we use α or α∨. Hence, in this case, the simple coroot α∨ would generate the same chamber as α. 

But wait, in this case, since A1 is self-dual (since α∨ is just a scalar multiple of α), the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, the base for R∨ would just be the same as the base for R. 

But in higher rank root systems, perhaps this is different. Let&#x27;s consider the root system A2, which consists of the roots in the two-dimensional space with simple roots α1 and α2 at 120 degrees. The coroots α1∨ and α2∨ are scaled versions of α1 and α2. Specifically, if α1 and α2 have the same length, then the coroots would be the same roots scaled by 2/(α, α). For example, in the standard normalization where (α, α) = 2, the coroot α∨ is equal to α. But if (α, α) = 1, then α∨ = 2α. 

Wait, in the root system A2, all roots have the same length. Let&#x27;s say the roots are vectors in Euclidean space with length √2, so that (α, α) = 2. Then α∨ = 2α/(α, α) = α. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, in this case, the simple coroots are the same as the simple roots, so B∨ = B, and hence B∨ is a base for R∨, which is R itself. So in this case, yes, B∨ is a base. 

But suppose we have a root system where roots have different lengths, say B2 or G2. Let&#x27;s take B2. In B2, there are long and short roots. Let me recall that in B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The coroots would be α∨ = 2α/(α, α) and β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Since α is long, (α, α) is larger than (β, β). For example, in B2, we can take α = e1 - e2 and β = e2, with (α, α) = 2 and (β, β) = 1. Then α∨ = 2α/2 = α, and β∨ = 2β/1 = 2β. So the coroots in B2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ consists of the roots α and 2β and their negatives, which is actually the root system C2. 

So, in this case, R∨ is of type C2, and the simple coroots for B2 are α and 2β. But in the dual root system C2, the simple roots are different. Wait, the dual root system of B2 is C2, where the simple roots are the coroots of B2. However, in C2, the simple roots are the coroots of B2, so the simple roots for C2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the base B∨ = {α, 2β} is indeed the base for the dual root system C2. 

Wait, but in C2, the simple roots are usually denoted as γ1 and γ2, where γ1 is long and γ2 is short. But in our case, if B2 has simple roots α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ = α and β∨ = 2β, which are the simple roots for C2. Therefore, B∨ is indeed a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in this case, the answer is yes. But let me verify another example. Take G2, which is more complicated. In G2, there are long and short roots, with the ratio of squared lengths being 3. The dual root system of G2 is still G2, since it is self-dual. Wait, but actually, in G2, the roots and coroots have the same length ratio because the ratio of the squares is 3, so when you take coroots, you invert the scaling. Wait, if α is a long root with (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2α/3, and if β is a short root with (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β. So the dual root system would consist of roots 2α/3 and 2β. But is this isomorphic to G2? Wait, G2 is self-dual because the dual of a root system is determined by the inverse of the Cartan matrix, and G2 is simply-laced in some sense? No, G2 is not simply-laced. Wait, maybe it&#x27;s self-dual. Let me recall that in G2, the Cartan matrix is:

[ 2 -3 ]

[-1 2 ]

The inverse of this matrix is:

[2  3]

[1  2] 

divided by determinant, which is 4 - 3 = 1. So the inverse Cartan matrix is the same as the transpose, which would be the Cartan matrix of the dual root system. But since the inverse is not the same as the original, unless we rescale. Wait, but since the Cartan matrix for the dual root system is the transpose of the original Cartan matrix, which for G2 is not symmetric. Wait, but in G2, the Cartan matrix is not symmetric, so its dual root system would have the transpose Cartan matrix, which would correspond to swapping the roots. But in G2, the roots have different lengths, so the dual root system would have the Cartan matrix with entries swapped. However, since G2 is its own dual under the scaling of roots. Let me check if the dual root system is isomorphic to G2.

Wait, if the original roots are long and short, then the coroots would be short and long, respectively. Because α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If α is long, say (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2/3 α, which would be a shorter root. If β is short, (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β, which is longer. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ would have roots that are the coroots of R, which in G2 case are scaled such that the long roots become short and vice versa. But since G2 is self-dual in the sense that the dual root system is isomorphic to the original, just with roots scaled. Therefore, R∨ is isomorphic to R, so the base B∨ would correspond to the base of R∨, which is isomorphic, so yes, B∨ is a base. 

Wait, but if we take the simple roots in G2 as α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ (short) and β∨ (long). Then B∨ would consist of a short root and a long root. In the dual root system R∨, which is isomorphic to G2, the simple roots are these coroots. So, in effect, the base B∨ is a set of simple roots for R∨, which is isomorphic to G2. Therefore, yes, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in all these examples, the set of simple coroots B∨ is indeed a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, perhaps the answer is yes. But I need to ensure there isn&#x27;t some root system where this fails. 

Alternatively, let&#x27;s think abstractly. Since the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same, the chambers are the same. The base for R corresponding to chamber C is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. The base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the set of simple roots δ1, ..., δl in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, δi∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δi∨ = δi (since for R∨, the coroots are the original roots). Wait, no. Wait, in the dual root system R∨, the coroots are (α∨)∨ = α. So if we take R∨, its coroots are the original roots. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = 0} where δ is a root in R∨, i.e., δ = α∨ for some α in R. But δ∨ = (α∨)∨ = α. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = Hα, which are the same as hyperplanes for R. Therefore, as before, chambers are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for those roots. But in R∨, the positive half-space for a root δ ∈ R∨ is defined by ⟨x, δ∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δ ∈ R∨ means δ = β∨ for some β ∈ R. Therefore, ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = ⟨x, (β∨)∨⟩ = ⟨x, β⟩. Therefore, the positive half-space for δ = β∨ is ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all simple roots αi. So if we want the base for R∨, we need the simple roots δj in R∨ such that ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 defines C. But δj∨ = βj, so this becomes ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original system, the chamber C is also defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, if the set of βj is such that ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, then βj must be related to αi∨. 

Wait, this seems a bit circular. Let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have the chamber C. For the original root system R, the simple roots αi are the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. For the dual root system R∨, the simple roots δj must be the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δj∨ is in R, since δj is in R∨. So δj∨ = αj. Therefore, the condition ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, for the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. But in the original system, C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Therefore, unless ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 and ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 define the same chamber, which is only the case if αj and αj∨ are scalar multiples. But αj∨ = 2αj/(αj, αj). Therefore, αj∨ is a scalar multiple of αj. Hence, the half-space ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is the same as ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 if and only if the scalar is positive, which it is. Since 2/(αj, αj) is positive, then yes, ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the chamber C is defined equivalently by either ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 or ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, in the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the set of simple roots for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the set of δj such that δj∨ = αj, which implies δj = αj∨. Therefore, the simple roots for R∨ are exactly the simple coroots B∨. 

Therefore, this shows that the set B∨ is indeed the base for the dual root system R∨ corresponding to the chamber C. 

Thus, in general, the simple coroots B∨ form a base for the dual root system R∨. 

But let me verify once again. Suppose that in the dual root system R∨, the simple roots are the simple coroots of R. Then the positive coroots in R∨ would be the non-negative linear combinations of the simple coroots. But in R∨, the roots are the coroots of R, so the positive coroots would correspond to the positive roots in R∨. But a positive root in R∨ is a coroot that is a non-negative combination of the simple coroots. However, in the original system, the positive roots are non-negative combinations of the simple roots. There&#x27;s a duality here. 

For example, in the original root system, a positive root is a sum of simple roots with non-negative coefficients. The coroot of a positive root is a positive coroot, but the positive coroots are not necessarily the same as the non-negative combinations of simple coroots. Wait, but if B∨ is a base for R∨, then every positive coroot in R∨ is a non-negative combination of B∨. Let me check with B2 example. 

In B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The positive roots are α, β, α + β, α + 2β. The coroots would be α∨ = α, β∨ = 2β. The positive coroots are α, 2β, α + 2β, 2α + 4β. Wait, no. Wait, the coroots of the roots are:

For α: α∨ = α.

For β: β∨ = 2β.

For α + β: (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/(α + β, α + β). Let&#x27;s compute (α + β, α + β) = (α, α) + 2(α, β) + (β, β). In B2, (α, α) = 2, (β, β) = 1, and (α, β) = -1. Therefore, (α + β, α + β) = 2 + 2*(-1) + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Therefore, (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/1 = 2α + 2β.

Similarly, for α + 2β: (α + 2β, α + 2β) = (α, α) + 4(α, β) + 4(β, β) = 2 + 4*(-1) + 4*1 = 2 -4 +4 = 2. Therefore, (α + 2β)∨ = 2(α + 2β)/2 = α + 2β.

Therefore, the positive coroots in R∨ are α, 2β, 2α + 2β, and α + 2β. 

Now, the simple coroots B∨ = {α∨, β∨} = {α, 2β}. The positive coroots in R∨ should be the non-negative combinations of α and 2β. Let&#x27;s see:

- α is a non-negative combination of α and 2β (1*α + 0*2β).
- 2β is 0*α + 1*2β.
- 2α + 2β is 2*α + 1*2β.
- α + 2β is 1*α + 1*2β.

Therefore, all positive coroots in R∨ are indeed non-negative combinations of the simple coroots B∨. Therefore, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Similarly, if we take a positive coroot like 2α + 2β, which is not a coroot of a simple root, but it is a combination of the simple coroots. Therefore, B∨ satisfies the conditions of a base. 

Hence, through these examples and abstract reasoning, it seems that the simple coroots B∨ indeed form a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the set of simple coroots \( B^\vee = \{\alpha_1^\vee, \ldots, \alpha_l^\vee\} \) forms a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \), we need to verify if \( B^\vee \) satisfies the properties of a base in the dual root system. 

1. **Hyperplanes and Chambers**: The hyperplanes for the dual root system \( R^\vee \) are the same as those for the original root system \( R \). This is because the coroot of a coroot \( (\alpha^\vee)^\vee \) is the original root \( \alpha \). Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of these hyperplanes, are the same for both \( R \) and \( R^\vee \).

2. **Base Definition**: A base for a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of these simple roots with all coefficients integers of the same sign. For \( B^\vee \) to be a base for \( R^\vee \), every coroot \( \beta^\vee \in R^\vee \) must be expressible as a non-negative or non-positive integer combination of the simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \).

3. **Duality Relationship**: The dual root system \( R^\vee \) consists of coroots \( \alpha^\vee \) for each root \( \alpha \in R \). The simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \) are scaled versions of the simple roots \( \alpha_i \). For a chamber \( C \), the base \( B \) of \( R \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i^\vee \rangle &gt; 0 \). For the dual root system \( R^\vee \), the same chamber \( C \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i \rangle &gt; 0 \), which is equivalent due to the scaling relationship between roots and coroots.

4. **Verification with Examples**: Checking examples such as \( A_1 \), \( A_2 \), \( B_2 \), and \( G_2 \) confirms that the simple coroots form a base for the dual root system. In each case, the simple coroots correspond to the simple roots of the dual system, ensuring that all positive coroots in \( R^\vee \) are non-negative combinations of the simple coroots.

Thus, the set \( B^\vee \) of simple coroots is indeed a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the set of simple coroots B∨ is always a base for the dual root system R∨. Let me start by recalling some definitions and properties related to root systems, dual root systems, chambers, and bases. 

First, a root system (V, R) consists of a finite set R of non-zero vectors (roots) in a Euclidean space V that satisfy certain axioms, like being closed under reflections and having rational Cartan numbers. The dual root system (V∨, R∨) is formed by taking the coroots α∨ = 2α/(α, α) for each root α in R. 

A chamber C, also known as a Weyl chamber, is a connected component of the complement in V of all the hyperplanes Hα = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0}. Each chamber is an open convex cone, and the group generated by the reflections over the hyperplanes Hα (the Weyl group) acts simply transitively on the chambers. 

For a given chamber C, the corresponding base B = B(C) is the unique set of simple roots {α1, ..., αl} such that C is defined by the intersection of the positive half-spaces determined by the simple roots. That is, C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. The simple roots form a basis of the vector space V and also a basis over the integers for the root lattice. 

Now, the question is whether the set B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} of simple coroots forms a base for the dual root system R∨. To check this, I need to verify if B∨ satisfies the properties of a base when considered in the dual root system. 

A base of a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of the base elements with all coefficients integers of the same sign (either all non-negative or all non-positive). So, for B∨ to be a base of R∨, every coroot β∨ in R∨ should be expressible as a linear combination of the αi∨ with coefficients all non-negative or all non-negative integers. 

First, note that the coroots α∨ are themselves roots in the dual root system R∨. So, B∨ is a subset of R∨. The key point is whether B∨ is a base in the sense of root systems for R∨. 

Given that dual root systems have a duality relationship, I suspect that the simple coroots should form a base for the dual system. However, I need to confirm this carefully. 

Let me recall that in the original root system R, the simple roots B = {α1, ..., αl} form a basis for V and define the positive roots R+ as those roots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple roots. Similarly, the positive coroots R∨+ would be those coroots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple coroots B∨. 

But wait, the coroot of a positive root is not necessarily a positive coroot. Let me check: If β is a positive root in R, then β = Σ niαi with ni ≥ 0. Then β∨ = 2β/(β, β). But how does this relate to the simple coroots? 

Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is that the dual root system R∨ has its own set of simple roots, which may or may not coincide with the simple coroots. 

Alternatively, since the dual of a root system is another root system, with the roles of roots and coroots swapped, perhaps the simple coroots in the original system correspond to the simple roots in the dual system. 

Wait, the coroot system R∨ is a root system in V∨, which is the dual space of V. But if V is equipped with an inner product, we can identify V with V∨, so perhaps they are considered in the same space. Wait, but actually, the coroot α∨ is defined as 2α/(α, α), so if we have a root α in V, then α∨ is in V as well, scaled by 2/(α, α). So the dual root system R∨ is in the same space V, not the dual space. That seems right because the definition of root systems usually includes being in a Euclidean space, and the dual roots are scaled versions. 

Therefore, R∨ is a root system in V, same as R. So the chambers for R∨ would be connected components of V minus the hyperplanes Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, (α∨)∨⟩ = 0}. But (α∨)∨ is equal to α, since the coroot of a coroot is the original root. So Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α⟩ = 0} = Hα. Wait, so the hyperplanes for R∨ are the same as the hyperplanes for R? 

Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s check. For the dual root system R∨, the hyperplanes would be Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β∨∨⟩ = 0}. But β∨ is a root in R∨, so (β∨)∨ = β∨∨ = 2β∨/(β∨, β∨). But β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = 2*(2β/(β, β)) / (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)).

Calculating the inner product in the denominator: (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)) = 4/(β, β)^2 * (β, β) = 4/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = (4β/(β, β)) / (4/(β, β)) ) = β. 

Hence, (β∨)∨ = β. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β⟩ = 0}, which are exactly the same as the hyperplanes Hβ for the original root system R. 

Therefore, the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same. Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of the hyperplanes, are the same for both root systems. 

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. If the hyperplanes are the same, then the chambers are the same. So a chamber C for R is also a chamber for R∨. 

But then, the base B(C) for R is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for each αi in B. Similarly, the base for R∨ corresponding to the same chamber C would be the set of simple roots for R∨, which are the simple coroots? Wait, but the simple roots for R∨ would be the set B∨?

But if the chambers are the same, then the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C should be the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of their positive half-spaces. But in R∨, the positive half-spaces are defined by ⟨x, β∨⟩ &gt; 0 for β∨ in R∨. But since β∨∨ = β, this is equivalent to ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. Wait, but in the original root system, the hyperplanes are defined by ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0. So the positive half-spaces for R∨ would be defined by ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0, where β is a root in R. But these are the same as the positive half-spaces for R, except that in R, the half-spaces are ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let&#x27;s clarify.

In the original root system R, the simple roots α1, ..., αl are such that the chamber C is the set of x in V where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

In the dual root system R∨, the roots are the coroots α∨ for α in R. The chamber for R∨ would be defined in terms of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots in R∨, which are the same hyperplanes as in R. So the chambers for R and R∨ are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the unique set of simple roots β1∨, ..., βl∨ in R∨ such that C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. But since βi∨∨ = βi, this is equivalent to C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. Therefore, in order for B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} to be the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C, we need that C is the set of x where ⟨x, αi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. But since αi∨∨ = αi, this would mean C is the set where ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

However, in the original definition, C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, unless ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is not generally true, these conditions are different. 

Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me check with an example. Let&#x27;s take the root system A1, which is just {α, -α}, with α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If we take the chamber C to be the positive half-line where ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, α⟩ &gt; 0 since α∨ is a positive multiple of α. So in this case, the chamber C is the same whether we use α or α∨. Hence, in this case, the simple coroot α∨ would generate the same chamber as α. 

But wait, in this case, since A1 is self-dual (since α∨ is just a scalar multiple of α), the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, the base for R∨ would just be the same as the base for R. 

But in higher rank root systems, perhaps this is different. Let&#x27;s consider the root system A2, which consists of the roots in the two-dimensional space with simple roots α1 and α2 at 120 degrees. The coroots α1∨ and α2∨ are scaled versions of α1 and α2. Specifically, if α1 and α2 have the same length, then the coroots would be the same roots scaled by 2/(α, α). For example, in the standard normalization where (α, α) = 2, the coroot α∨ is equal to α. But if (α, α) = 1, then α∨ = 2α. 

Wait, in the root system A2, all roots have the same length. Let&#x27;s say the roots are vectors in Euclidean space with length √2, so that (α, α) = 2. Then α∨ = 2α/(α, α) = α. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, in this case, the simple coroots are the same as the simple roots, so B∨ = B, and hence B∨ is a base for R∨, which is R itself. So in this case, yes, B∨ is a base. 

But suppose we have a root system where roots have different lengths, say B2 or G2. Let&#x27;s take B2. In B2, there are long and short roots. Let me recall that in B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The coroots would be α∨ = 2α/(α, α) and β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Since α is long, (α, α) is larger than (β, β). For example, in B2, we can take α = e1 - e2 and β = e2, with (α, α) = 2 and (β, β) = 1. Then α∨ = 2α/2 = α, and β∨ = 2β/1 = 2β. So the coroots in B2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ consists of the roots α and 2β and their negatives, which is actually the root system C2. 

So, in this case, R∨ is of type C2, and the simple coroots for B2 are α and 2β. But in the dual root system C2, the simple roots are different. Wait, the dual root system of B2 is C2, where the simple roots are the coroots of B2. However, in C2, the simple roots are the coroots of B2, so the simple roots for C2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the base B∨ = {α, 2β} is indeed the base for the dual root system C2. 

Wait, but in C2, the simple roots are usually denoted as γ1 and γ2, where γ1 is long and γ2 is short. But in our case, if B2 has simple roots α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ = α and β∨ = 2β, which are the simple roots for C2. Therefore, B∨ is indeed a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in this case, the answer is yes. But let me verify another example. Take G2, which is more complicated. In G2, there are long and short roots, with the ratio of squared lengths being 3. The dual root system of G2 is still G2, since it is self-dual. Wait, but actually, in G2, the roots and coroots have the same length ratio because the ratio of the squares is 3, so when you take coroots, you invert the scaling. Wait, if α is a long root with (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2α/3, and if β is a short root with (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β. So the dual root system would consist of roots 2α/3 and 2β. But is this isomorphic to G2? Wait, G2 is self-dual because the dual of a root system is determined by the inverse of the Cartan matrix, and G2 is simply-laced in some sense? No, G2 is not simply-laced. Wait, maybe it&#x27;s self-dual. Let me recall that in G2, the Cartan matrix is:

[ 2 -3 ]

[-1 2 ]

The inverse of this matrix is:

[2  3]

[1  2] 

divided by determinant, which is 4 - 3 = 1. So the inverse Cartan matrix is the same as the transpose, which would be the Cartan matrix of the dual root system. But since the inverse is not the same as the original, unless we rescale. Wait, but since the Cartan matrix for the dual root system is the transpose of the original Cartan matrix, which for G2 is not symmetric. Wait, but in G2, the Cartan matrix is not symmetric, so its dual root system would have the transpose Cartan matrix, which would correspond to swapping the roots. But in G2, the roots have different lengths, so the dual root system would have the Cartan matrix with entries swapped. However, since G2 is its own dual under the scaling of roots. Let me check if the dual root system is isomorphic to G2.

Wait, if the original roots are long and short, then the coroots would be short and long, respectively. Because α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If α is long, say (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2/3 α, which would be a shorter root. If β is short, (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β, which is longer. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ would have roots that are the coroots of R, which in G2 case are scaled such that the long roots become short and vice versa. But since G2 is self-dual in the sense that the dual root system is isomorphic to the original, just with roots scaled. Therefore, R∨ is isomorphic to R, so the base B∨ would correspond to the base of R∨, which is isomorphic, so yes, B∨ is a base. 

Wait, but if we take the simple roots in G2 as α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ (short) and β∨ (long). Then B∨ would consist of a short root and a long root. In the dual root system R∨, which is isomorphic to G2, the simple roots are these coroots. So, in effect, the base B∨ is a set of simple roots for R∨, which is isomorphic to G2. Therefore, yes, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in all these examples, the set of simple coroots B∨ is indeed a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, perhaps the answer is yes. But I need to ensure there isn&#x27;t some root system where this fails. 

Alternatively, let&#x27;s think abstractly. Since the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same, the chambers are the same. The base for R corresponding to chamber C is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. The base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the set of simple roots δ1, ..., δl in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, δi∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δi∨ = δi (since for R∨, the coroots are the original roots). Wait, no. Wait, in the dual root system R∨, the coroots are (α∨)∨ = α. So if we take R∨, its coroots are the original roots. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = 0} where δ is a root in R∨, i.e., δ = α∨ for some α in R. But δ∨ = (α∨)∨ = α. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = Hα, which are the same as hyperplanes for R. Therefore, as before, chambers are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for those roots. But in R∨, the positive half-space for a root δ ∈ R∨ is defined by ⟨x, δ∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δ ∈ R∨ means δ = β∨ for some β ∈ R. Therefore, ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = ⟨x, (β∨)∨⟩ = ⟨x, β⟩. Therefore, the positive half-space for δ = β∨ is ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all simple roots αi. So if we want the base for R∨, we need the simple roots δj in R∨ such that ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 defines C. But δj∨ = βj, so this becomes ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original system, the chamber C is also defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, if the set of βj is such that ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, then βj must be related to αi∨. 

Wait, this seems a bit circular. Let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have the chamber C. For the original root system R, the simple roots αi are the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. For the dual root system R∨, the simple roots δj must be the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δj∨ is in R, since δj is in R∨. So δj∨ = αj. Therefore, the condition ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, for the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. But in the original system, C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Therefore, unless ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 and ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 define the same chamber, which is only the case if αj and αj∨ are scalar multiples. But αj∨ = 2αj/(αj, αj). Therefore, αj∨ is a scalar multiple of αj. Hence, the half-space ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is the same as ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 if and only if the scalar is positive, which it is. Since 2/(αj, αj) is positive, then yes, ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the chamber C is defined equivalently by either ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 or ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, in the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the set of simple roots for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the set of δj such that δj∨ = αj, which implies δj = αj∨. Therefore, the simple roots for R∨ are exactly the simple coroots B∨. 

Therefore, this shows that the set B∨ is indeed the base for the dual root system R∨ corresponding to the chamber C. 

Thus, in general, the simple coroots B∨ form a base for the dual root system R∨. 

But let me verify once again. Suppose that in the dual root system R∨, the simple roots are the simple coroots of R. Then the positive coroots in R∨ would be the non-negative linear combinations of the simple coroots. But in R∨, the roots are the coroots of R, so the positive coroots would correspond to the positive roots in R∨. But a positive root in R∨ is a coroot that is a non-negative combination of the simple coroots. However, in the original system, the positive roots are non-negative combinations of the simple roots. There&#x27;s a duality here. 

For example, in the original root system, a positive root is a sum of simple roots with non-negative coefficients. The coroot of a positive root is a positive coroot, but the positive coroots are not necessarily the same as the non-negative combinations of simple coroots. Wait, but if B∨ is a base for R∨, then every positive coroot in R∨ is a non-negative combination of B∨. Let me check with B2 example. 

In B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The positive roots are α, β, α + β, α + 2β. The coroots would be α∨ = α, β∨ = 2β. The positive coroots are α, 2β, α + 2β, 2α + 4β. Wait, no. Wait, the coroots of the roots are:

For α: α∨ = α.

For β: β∨ = 2β.

For α + β: (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/(α + β, α + β). Let&#x27;s compute (α + β, α + β) = (α, α) + 2(α, β) + (β, β). In B2, (α, α) = 2, (β, β) = 1, and (α, β) = -1. Therefore, (α + β, α + β) = 2 + 2*(-1) + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Therefore, (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/1 = 2α + 2β.

Similarly, for α + 2β: (α + 2β, α + 2β) = (α, α) + 4(α, β) + 4(β, β) = 2 + 4*(-1) + 4*1 = 2 -4 +4 = 2. Therefore, (α + 2β)∨ = 2(α + 2β)/2 = α + 2β.

Therefore, the positive coroots in R∨ are α, 2β, 2α + 2β, and α + 2β. 

Now, the simple coroots B∨ = {α∨, β∨} = {α, 2β}. The positive coroots in R∨ should be the non-negative combinations of α and 2β. Let&#x27;s see:

- α is a non-negative combination of α and 2β (1*α + 0*2β).
- 2β is 0*α + 1*2β.
- 2α + 2β is 2*α + 1*2β.
- α + 2β is 1*α + 1*2β.

Therefore, all positive coroots in R∨ are indeed non-negative combinations of the simple coroots B∨. Therefore, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Similarly, if we take a positive coroot like 2α + 2β, which is not a coroot of a simple root, but it is a combination of the simple coroots. Therefore, B∨ satisfies the conditions of a base. 

Hence, through these examples and abstract reasoning, it seems that the simple coroots B∨ indeed form a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the set of simple coroots \( B^\vee = \{\alpha_1^\vee, \ldots, \alpha_l^\vee\} \) forms a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \), we need to verify if \( B^\vee \) satisfies the properties of a base in the dual root system. 

1. **Hyperplanes and Chambers**: The hyperplanes for the dual root system \( R^\vee \) are the same as those for the original root system \( R \). This is because the coroot of a coroot \( (\alpha^\vee)^\vee \) is the original root \( \alpha \). Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of these hyperplanes, are the same for both \( R \) and \( R^\vee \).

2. **Base Definition**: A base for a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of these simple roots with all coefficients integers of the same sign. For \( B^\vee \) to be a base for \( R^\vee \), every coroot \( \beta^\vee \in R^\vee \) must be expressible as a non-negative or non-positive integer combination of the simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \).

3. **Duality Relationship**: The dual root system \( R^\vee \) consists of coroots \( \alpha^\vee \) for each root \( \alpha \in R \). The simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \) are scaled versions of the simple roots \( \alpha_i \). For a chamber \( C \), the base \( B \) of \( R \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i^\vee \rangle &gt; 0 \). For the dual root system \( R^\vee \), the same chamber \( C \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i \rangle &gt; 0 \), which is equivalent due to the scaling relationship between roots and coroots.

4. **Verification with Examples**: Checking examples such as \( A_1 \), \( A_2 \), \( B_2 \), and \( G_2 \) confirms that the simple coroots form a base for the dual root system. In each case, the simple coroots correspond to the simple roots of the dual system, ensuring that all positive coroots in \( R^\vee \) are non-negative combinations of the simple coroots.

Thus, the set \( B^\vee \) of simple coroots is indeed a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the set of simple coroots B∨ is always a base for the dual root system R∨. Let me start by recalling some definitions and properties related to root systems, dual root systems, chambers, and bases. 

First, a root system (V, R) consists of a finite set R of non-zero vectors (roots) in a Euclidean space V that satisfy certain axioms, like being closed under reflections and having rational Cartan numbers. The dual root system (V∨, R∨) is formed by taking the coroots α∨ = 2α/(α, α) for each root α in R. 

A chamber C, also known as a Weyl chamber, is a connected component of the complement in V of all the hyperplanes Hα = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0}. Each chamber is an open convex cone, and the group generated by the reflections over the hyperplanes Hα (the Weyl group) acts simply transitively on the chambers. 

For a given chamber C, the corresponding base B = B(C) is the unique set of simple roots {α1, ..., αl} such that C is defined by the intersection of the positive half-spaces determined by the simple roots. That is, C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. The simple roots form a basis of the vector space V and also a basis over the integers for the root lattice. 

Now, the question is whether the set B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} of simple coroots forms a base for the dual root system R∨. To check this, I need to verify if B∨ satisfies the properties of a base when considered in the dual root system. 

A base of a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of the base elements with all coefficients integers of the same sign (either all non-negative or all non-positive). So, for B∨ to be a base of R∨, every coroot β∨ in R∨ should be expressible as a linear combination of the αi∨ with coefficients all non-negative or all non-negative integers. 

First, note that the coroots α∨ are themselves roots in the dual root system R∨. So, B∨ is a subset of R∨. The key point is whether B∨ is a base in the sense of root systems for R∨. 

Given that dual root systems have a duality relationship, I suspect that the simple coroots should form a base for the dual system. However, I need to confirm this carefully. 

Let me recall that in the original root system R, the simple roots B = {α1, ..., αl} form a basis for V and define the positive roots R+ as those roots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple roots. Similarly, the positive coroots R∨+ would be those coroots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple coroots B∨. 

But wait, the coroot of a positive root is not necessarily a positive coroot. Let me check: If β is a positive root in R, then β = Σ niαi with ni ≥ 0. Then β∨ = 2β/(β, β). But how does this relate to the simple coroots? 

Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is that the dual root system R∨ has its own set of simple roots, which may or may not coincide with the simple coroots. 

Alternatively, since the dual of a root system is another root system, with the roles of roots and coroots swapped, perhaps the simple coroots in the original system correspond to the simple roots in the dual system. 

Wait, the coroot system R∨ is a root system in V∨, which is the dual space of V. But if V is equipped with an inner product, we can identify V with V∨, so perhaps they are considered in the same space. Wait, but actually, the coroot α∨ is defined as 2α/(α, α), so if we have a root α in V, then α∨ is in V as well, scaled by 2/(α, α). So the dual root system R∨ is in the same space V, not the dual space. That seems right because the definition of root systems usually includes being in a Euclidean space, and the dual roots are scaled versions. 

Therefore, R∨ is a root system in V, same as R. So the chambers for R∨ would be connected components of V minus the hyperplanes Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, (α∨)∨⟩ = 0}. But (α∨)∨ is equal to α, since the coroot of a coroot is the original root. So Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α⟩ = 0} = Hα. Wait, so the hyperplanes for R∨ are the same as the hyperplanes for R? 

Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s check. For the dual root system R∨, the hyperplanes would be Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β∨∨⟩ = 0}. But β∨ is a root in R∨, so (β∨)∨ = β∨∨ = 2β∨/(β∨, β∨). But β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = 2*(2β/(β, β)) / (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)).

Calculating the inner product in the denominator: (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)) = 4/(β, β)^2 * (β, β) = 4/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = (4β/(β, β)) / (4/(β, β)) ) = β. 

Hence, (β∨)∨ = β. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β⟩ = 0}, which are exactly the same as the hyperplanes Hβ for the original root system R. 

Therefore, the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same. Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of the hyperplanes, are the same for both root systems. 

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. If the hyperplanes are the same, then the chambers are the same. So a chamber C for R is also a chamber for R∨. 

But then, the base B(C) for R is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for each αi in B. Similarly, the base for R∨ corresponding to the same chamber C would be the set of simple roots for R∨, which are the simple coroots? Wait, but the simple roots for R∨ would be the set B∨?

But if the chambers are the same, then the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C should be the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of their positive half-spaces. But in R∨, the positive half-spaces are defined by ⟨x, β∨⟩ &gt; 0 for β∨ in R∨. But since β∨∨ = β, this is equivalent to ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. Wait, but in the original root system, the hyperplanes are defined by ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0. So the positive half-spaces for R∨ would be defined by ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0, where β is a root in R. But these are the same as the positive half-spaces for R, except that in R, the half-spaces are ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let&#x27;s clarify.

In the original root system R, the simple roots α1, ..., αl are such that the chamber C is the set of x in V where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

In the dual root system R∨, the roots are the coroots α∨ for α in R. The chamber for R∨ would be defined in terms of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots in R∨, which are the same hyperplanes as in R. So the chambers for R and R∨ are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the unique set of simple roots β1∨, ..., βl∨ in R∨ such that C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. But since βi∨∨ = βi, this is equivalent to C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. Therefore, in order for B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} to be the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C, we need that C is the set of x where ⟨x, αi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. But since αi∨∨ = αi, this would mean C is the set where ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

However, in the original definition, C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, unless ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is not generally true, these conditions are different. 

Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me check with an example. Let&#x27;s take the root system A1, which is just {α, -α}, with α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If we take the chamber C to be the positive half-line where ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, α⟩ &gt; 0 since α∨ is a positive multiple of α. So in this case, the chamber C is the same whether we use α or α∨. Hence, in this case, the simple coroot α∨ would generate the same chamber as α. 

But wait, in this case, since A1 is self-dual (since α∨ is just a scalar multiple of α), the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, the base for R∨ would just be the same as the base for R. 

But in higher rank root systems, perhaps this is different. Let&#x27;s consider the root system A2, which consists of the roots in the two-dimensional space with simple roots α1 and α2 at 120 degrees. The coroots α1∨ and α2∨ are scaled versions of α1 and α2. Specifically, if α1 and α2 have the same length, then the coroots would be the same roots scaled by 2/(α, α). For example, in the standard normalization where (α, α) = 2, the coroot α∨ is equal to α. But if (α, α) = 1, then α∨ = 2α. 

Wait, in the root system A2, all roots have the same length. Let&#x27;s say the roots are vectors in Euclidean space with length √2, so that (α, α) = 2. Then α∨ = 2α/(α, α) = α. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, in this case, the simple coroots are the same as the simple roots, so B∨ = B, and hence B∨ is a base for R∨, which is R itself. So in this case, yes, B∨ is a base. 

But suppose we have a root system where roots have different lengths, say B2 or G2. Let&#x27;s take B2. In B2, there are long and short roots. Let me recall that in B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The coroots would be α∨ = 2α/(α, α) and β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Since α is long, (α, α) is larger than (β, β). For example, in B2, we can take α = e1 - e2 and β = e2, with (α, α) = 2 and (β, β) = 1. Then α∨ = 2α/2 = α, and β∨ = 2β/1 = 2β. So the coroots in B2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ consists of the roots α and 2β and their negatives, which is actually the root system C2. 

So, in this case, R∨ is of type C2, and the simple coroots for B2 are α and 2β. But in the dual root system C2, the simple roots are different. Wait, the dual root system of B2 is C2, where the simple roots are the coroots of B2. However, in C2, the simple roots are the coroots of B2, so the simple roots for C2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the base B∨ = {α, 2β} is indeed the base for the dual root system C2. 

Wait, but in C2, the simple roots are usually denoted as γ1 and γ2, where γ1 is long and γ2 is short. But in our case, if B2 has simple roots α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ = α and β∨ = 2β, which are the simple roots for C2. Therefore, B∨ is indeed a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in this case, the answer is yes. But let me verify another example. Take G2, which is more complicated. In G2, there are long and short roots, with the ratio of squared lengths being 3. The dual root system of G2 is still G2, since it is self-dual. Wait, but actually, in G2, the roots and coroots have the same length ratio because the ratio of the squares is 3, so when you take coroots, you invert the scaling. Wait, if α is a long root with (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2α/3, and if β is a short root with (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β. So the dual root system would consist of roots 2α/3 and 2β. But is this isomorphic to G2? Wait, G2 is self-dual because the dual of a root system is determined by the inverse of the Cartan matrix, and G2 is simply-laced in some sense? No, G2 is not simply-laced. Wait, maybe it&#x27;s self-dual. Let me recall that in G2, the Cartan matrix is:

[ 2 -3 ]

[-1 2 ]

The inverse of this matrix is:

[2  3]

[1  2] 

divided by determinant, which is 4 - 3 = 1. So the inverse Cartan matrix is the same as the transpose, which would be the Cartan matrix of the dual root system. But since the inverse is not the same as the original, unless we rescale. Wait, but since the Cartan matrix for the dual root system is the transpose of the original Cartan matrix, which for G2 is not symmetric. Wait, but in G2, the Cartan matrix is not symmetric, so its dual root system would have the transpose Cartan matrix, which would correspond to swapping the roots. But in G2, the roots have different lengths, so the dual root system would have the Cartan matrix with entries swapped. However, since G2 is its own dual under the scaling of roots. Let me check if the dual root system is isomorphic to G2.

Wait, if the original roots are long and short, then the coroots would be short and long, respectively. Because α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If α is long, say (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2/3 α, which would be a shorter root. If β is short, (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β, which is longer. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ would have roots that are the coroots of R, which in G2 case are scaled such that the long roots become short and vice versa. But since G2 is self-dual in the sense that the dual root system is isomorphic to the original, just with roots scaled. Therefore, R∨ is isomorphic to R, so the base B∨ would correspond to the base of R∨, which is isomorphic, so yes, B∨ is a base. 

Wait, but if we take the simple roots in G2 as α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ (short) and β∨ (long). Then B∨ would consist of a short root and a long root. In the dual root system R∨, which is isomorphic to G2, the simple roots are these coroots. So, in effect, the base B∨ is a set of simple roots for R∨, which is isomorphic to G2. Therefore, yes, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in all these examples, the set of simple coroots B∨ is indeed a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, perhaps the answer is yes. But I need to ensure there isn&#x27;t some root system where this fails. 

Alternatively, let&#x27;s think abstractly. Since the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same, the chambers are the same. The base for R corresponding to chamber C is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. The base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the set of simple roots δ1, ..., δl in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, δi∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δi∨ = δi (since for R∨, the coroots are the original roots). Wait, no. Wait, in the dual root system R∨, the coroots are (α∨)∨ = α. So if we take R∨, its coroots are the original roots. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = 0} where δ is a root in R∨, i.e., δ = α∨ for some α in R. But δ∨ = (α∨)∨ = α. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = Hα, which are the same as hyperplanes for R. Therefore, as before, chambers are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for those roots. But in R∨, the positive half-space for a root δ ∈ R∨ is defined by ⟨x, δ∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δ ∈ R∨ means δ = β∨ for some β ∈ R. Therefore, ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = ⟨x, (β∨)∨⟩ = ⟨x, β⟩. Therefore, the positive half-space for δ = β∨ is ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all simple roots αi. So if we want the base for R∨, we need the simple roots δj in R∨ such that ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 defines C. But δj∨ = βj, so this becomes ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original system, the chamber C is also defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, if the set of βj is such that ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, then βj must be related to αi∨. 

Wait, this seems a bit circular. Let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have the chamber C. For the original root system R, the simple roots αi are the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. For the dual root system R∨, the simple roots δj must be the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δj∨ is in R, since δj is in R∨. So δj∨ = αj. Therefore, the condition ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, for the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. But in the original system, C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Therefore, unless ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 and ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 define the same chamber, which is only the case if αj and αj∨ are scalar multiples. But αj∨ = 2αj/(αj, αj). Therefore, αj∨ is a scalar multiple of αj. Hence, the half-space ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is the same as ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 if and only if the scalar is positive, which it is. Since 2/(αj, αj) is positive, then yes, ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the chamber C is defined equivalently by either ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 or ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, in the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the set of simple roots for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the set of δj such that δj∨ = αj, which implies δj = αj∨. Therefore, the simple roots for R∨ are exactly the simple coroots B∨. 

Therefore, this shows that the set B∨ is indeed the base for the dual root system R∨ corresponding to the chamber C. 

Thus, in general, the simple coroots B∨ form a base for the dual root system R∨. 

But let me verify once again. Suppose that in the dual root system R∨, the simple roots are the simple coroots of R. Then the positive coroots in R∨ would be the non-negative linear combinations of the simple coroots. But in R∨, the roots are the coroots of R, so the positive coroots would correspond to the positive roots in R∨. But a positive root in R∨ is a coroot that is a non-negative combination of the simple coroots. However, in the original system, the positive roots are non-negative combinations of the simple roots. There&#x27;s a duality here. 

For example, in the original root system, a positive root is a sum of simple roots with non-negative coefficients. The coroot of a positive root is a positive coroot, but the positive coroots are not necessarily the same as the non-negative combinations of simple coroots. Wait, but if B∨ is a base for R∨, then every positive coroot in R∨ is a non-negative combination of B∨. Let me check with B2 example. 

In B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The positive roots are α, β, α + β, α + 2β. The coroots would be α∨ = α, β∨ = 2β. The positive coroots are α, 2β, α + 2β, 2α + 4β. Wait, no. Wait, the coroots of the roots are:

For α: α∨ = α.

For β: β∨ = 2β.

For α + β: (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/(α + β, α + β). Let&#x27;s compute (α + β, α + β) = (α, α) + 2(α, β) + (β, β). In B2, (α, α) = 2, (β, β) = 1, and (α, β) = -1. Therefore, (α + β, α + β) = 2 + 2*(-1) + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Therefore, (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/1 = 2α + 2β.

Similarly, for α + 2β: (α + 2β, α + 2β) = (α, α) + 4(α, β) + 4(β, β) = 2 + 4*(-1) + 4*1 = 2 -4 +4 = 2. Therefore, (α + 2β)∨ = 2(α + 2β)/2 = α + 2β.

Therefore, the positive coroots in R∨ are α, 2β, 2α + 2β, and α + 2β. 

Now, the simple coroots B∨ = {α∨, β∨} = {α, 2β}. The positive coroots in R∨ should be the non-negative combinations of α and 2β. Let&#x27;s see:

- α is a non-negative combination of α and 2β (1*α + 0*2β).
- 2β is 0*α + 1*2β.
- 2α + 2β is 2*α + 1*2β.
- α + 2β is 1*α + 1*2β.

Therefore, all positive coroots in R∨ are indeed non-negative combinations of the simple coroots B∨. Therefore, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Similarly, if we take a positive coroot like 2α + 2β, which is not a coroot of a simple root, but it is a combination of the simple coroots. Therefore, B∨ satisfies the conditions of a base. 

Hence, through these examples and abstract reasoning, it seems that the simple coroots B∨ indeed form a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the set of simple coroots \( B^\vee = \{\alpha_1^\vee, \ldots, \alpha_l^\vee\} \) forms a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \), we need to verify if \( B^\vee \) satisfies the properties of a base in the dual root system. 

1. **Hyperplanes and Chambers**: The hyperplanes for the dual root system \( R^\vee \) are the same as those for the original root system \( R \). This is because the coroot of a coroot \( (\alpha^\vee)^\vee \) is the original root \( \alpha \). Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of these hyperplanes, are the same for both \( R \) and \( R^\vee \).

2. **Base Definition**: A base for a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of these simple roots with all coefficients integers of the same sign. For \( B^\vee \) to be a base for \( R^\vee \), every coroot \( \beta^\vee \in R^\vee \) must be expressible as a non-negative or non-positive integer combination of the simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \).

3. **Duality Relationship**: The dual root system \( R^\vee \) consists of coroots \( \alpha^\vee \) for each root \( \alpha \in R \). The simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \) are scaled versions of the simple roots \( \alpha_i \). For a chamber \( C \), the base \( B \) of \( R \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i^\vee \rangle &gt; 0 \). For the dual root system \( R^\vee \), the same chamber \( C \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i \rangle &gt; 0 \), which is equivalent due to the scaling relationship between roots and coroots.

4. **Verification with Examples**: Checking examples such as \( A_1 \), \( A_2 \), \( B_2 \), and \( G_2 \) confirms that the simple coroots form a base for the dual root system. In each case, the simple coroots correspond to the simple roots of the dual system, ensuring that all positive coroots in \( R^\vee \) are non-negative combinations of the simple coroots.

Thus, the set \( B^\vee \) of simple coroots is indeed a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the set of simple coroots B∨ is always a base for the dual root system R∨. Let me start by recalling some definitions and properties related to root systems, dual root systems, chambers, and bases. 

First, a root system (V, R) consists of a finite set R of non-zero vectors (roots) in a Euclidean space V that satisfy certain axioms, like being closed under reflections and having rational Cartan numbers. The dual root system (V∨, R∨) is formed by taking the coroots α∨ = 2α/(α, α) for each root α in R. 

A chamber C, also known as a Weyl chamber, is a connected component of the complement in V of all the hyperplanes Hα = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0}. Each chamber is an open convex cone, and the group generated by the reflections over the hyperplanes Hα (the Weyl group) acts simply transitively on the chambers. 

For a given chamber C, the corresponding base B = B(C) is the unique set of simple roots {α1, ..., αl} such that C is defined by the intersection of the positive half-spaces determined by the simple roots. That is, C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. The simple roots form a basis of the vector space V and also a basis over the integers for the root lattice. 

Now, the question is whether the set B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} of simple coroots forms a base for the dual root system R∨. To check this, I need to verify if B∨ satisfies the properties of a base when considered in the dual root system. 

A base of a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of the base elements with all coefficients integers of the same sign (either all non-negative or all non-positive). So, for B∨ to be a base of R∨, every coroot β∨ in R∨ should be expressible as a linear combination of the αi∨ with coefficients all non-negative or all non-negative integers. 

First, note that the coroots α∨ are themselves roots in the dual root system R∨. So, B∨ is a subset of R∨. The key point is whether B∨ is a base in the sense of root systems for R∨. 

Given that dual root systems have a duality relationship, I suspect that the simple coroots should form a base for the dual system. However, I need to confirm this carefully. 

Let me recall that in the original root system R, the simple roots B = {α1, ..., αl} form a basis for V and define the positive roots R+ as those roots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple roots. Similarly, the positive coroots R∨+ would be those coroots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple coroots B∨. 

But wait, the coroot of a positive root is not necessarily a positive coroot. Let me check: If β is a positive root in R, then β = Σ niαi with ni ≥ 0. Then β∨ = 2β/(β, β). But how does this relate to the simple coroots? 

Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is that the dual root system R∨ has its own set of simple roots, which may or may not coincide with the simple coroots. 

Alternatively, since the dual of a root system is another root system, with the roles of roots and coroots swapped, perhaps the simple coroots in the original system correspond to the simple roots in the dual system. 

Wait, the coroot system R∨ is a root system in V∨, which is the dual space of V. But if V is equipped with an inner product, we can identify V with V∨, so perhaps they are considered in the same space. Wait, but actually, the coroot α∨ is defined as 2α/(α, α), so if we have a root α in V, then α∨ is in V as well, scaled by 2/(α, α). So the dual root system R∨ is in the same space V, not the dual space. That seems right because the definition of root systems usually includes being in a Euclidean space, and the dual roots are scaled versions. 

Therefore, R∨ is a root system in V, same as R. So the chambers for R∨ would be connected components of V minus the hyperplanes Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, (α∨)∨⟩ = 0}. But (α∨)∨ is equal to α, since the coroot of a coroot is the original root. So Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α⟩ = 0} = Hα. Wait, so the hyperplanes for R∨ are the same as the hyperplanes for R? 

Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s check. For the dual root system R∨, the hyperplanes would be Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β∨∨⟩ = 0}. But β∨ is a root in R∨, so (β∨)∨ = β∨∨ = 2β∨/(β∨, β∨). But β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = 2*(2β/(β, β)) / (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)).

Calculating the inner product in the denominator: (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)) = 4/(β, β)^2 * (β, β) = 4/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = (4β/(β, β)) / (4/(β, β)) ) = β. 

Hence, (β∨)∨ = β. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β⟩ = 0}, which are exactly the same as the hyperplanes Hβ for the original root system R. 

Therefore, the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same. Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of the hyperplanes, are the same for both root systems. 

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. If the hyperplanes are the same, then the chambers are the same. So a chamber C for R is also a chamber for R∨. 

But then, the base B(C) for R is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for each αi in B. Similarly, the base for R∨ corresponding to the same chamber C would be the set of simple roots for R∨, which are the simple coroots? Wait, but the simple roots for R∨ would be the set B∨?

But if the chambers are the same, then the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C should be the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of their positive half-spaces. But in R∨, the positive half-spaces are defined by ⟨x, β∨⟩ &gt; 0 for β∨ in R∨. But since β∨∨ = β, this is equivalent to ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. Wait, but in the original root system, the hyperplanes are defined by ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0. So the positive half-spaces for R∨ would be defined by ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0, where β is a root in R. But these are the same as the positive half-spaces for R, except that in R, the half-spaces are ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let&#x27;s clarify.

In the original root system R, the simple roots α1, ..., αl are such that the chamber C is the set of x in V where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

In the dual root system R∨, the roots are the coroots α∨ for α in R. The chamber for R∨ would be defined in terms of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots in R∨, which are the same hyperplanes as in R. So the chambers for R and R∨ are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the unique set of simple roots β1∨, ..., βl∨ in R∨ such that C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. But since βi∨∨ = βi, this is equivalent to C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. Therefore, in order for B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} to be the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C, we need that C is the set of x where ⟨x, αi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. But since αi∨∨ = αi, this would mean C is the set where ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

However, in the original definition, C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, unless ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is not generally true, these conditions are different. 

Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me check with an example. Let&#x27;s take the root system A1, which is just {α, -α}, with α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If we take the chamber C to be the positive half-line where ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, α⟩ &gt; 0 since α∨ is a positive multiple of α. So in this case, the chamber C is the same whether we use α or α∨. Hence, in this case, the simple coroot α∨ would generate the same chamber as α. 

But wait, in this case, since A1 is self-dual (since α∨ is just a scalar multiple of α), the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, the base for R∨ would just be the same as the base for R. 

But in higher rank root systems, perhaps this is different. Let&#x27;s consider the root system A2, which consists of the roots in the two-dimensional space with simple roots α1 and α2 at 120 degrees. The coroots α1∨ and α2∨ are scaled versions of α1 and α2. Specifically, if α1 and α2 have the same length, then the coroots would be the same roots scaled by 2/(α, α). For example, in the standard normalization where (α, α) = 2, the coroot α∨ is equal to α. But if (α, α) = 1, then α∨ = 2α. 

Wait, in the root system A2, all roots have the same length. Let&#x27;s say the roots are vectors in Euclidean space with length √2, so that (α, α) = 2. Then α∨ = 2α/(α, α) = α. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, in this case, the simple coroots are the same as the simple roots, so B∨ = B, and hence B∨ is a base for R∨, which is R itself. So in this case, yes, B∨ is a base. 

But suppose we have a root system where roots have different lengths, say B2 or G2. Let&#x27;s take B2. In B2, there are long and short roots. Let me recall that in B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The coroots would be α∨ = 2α/(α, α) and β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Since α is long, (α, α) is larger than (β, β). For example, in B2, we can take α = e1 - e2 and β = e2, with (α, α) = 2 and (β, β) = 1. Then α∨ = 2α/2 = α, and β∨ = 2β/1 = 2β. So the coroots in B2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ consists of the roots α and 2β and their negatives, which is actually the root system C2. 

So, in this case, R∨ is of type C2, and the simple coroots for B2 are α and 2β. But in the dual root system C2, the simple roots are different. Wait, the dual root system of B2 is C2, where the simple roots are the coroots of B2. However, in C2, the simple roots are the coroots of B2, so the simple roots for C2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the base B∨ = {α, 2β} is indeed the base for the dual root system C2. 

Wait, but in C2, the simple roots are usually denoted as γ1 and γ2, where γ1 is long and γ2 is short. But in our case, if B2 has simple roots α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ = α and β∨ = 2β, which are the simple roots for C2. Therefore, B∨ is indeed a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in this case, the answer is yes. But let me verify another example. Take G2, which is more complicated. In G2, there are long and short roots, with the ratio of squared lengths being 3. The dual root system of G2 is still G2, since it is self-dual. Wait, but actually, in G2, the roots and coroots have the same length ratio because the ratio of the squares is 3, so when you take coroots, you invert the scaling. Wait, if α is a long root with (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2α/3, and if β is a short root with (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β. So the dual root system would consist of roots 2α/3 and 2β. But is this isomorphic to G2? Wait, G2 is self-dual because the dual of a root system is determined by the inverse of the Cartan matrix, and G2 is simply-laced in some sense? No, G2 is not simply-laced. Wait, maybe it&#x27;s self-dual. Let me recall that in G2, the Cartan matrix is:

[ 2 -3 ]

[-1 2 ]

The inverse of this matrix is:

[2  3]

[1  2] 

divided by determinant, which is 4 - 3 = 1. So the inverse Cartan matrix is the same as the transpose, which would be the Cartan matrix of the dual root system. But since the inverse is not the same as the original, unless we rescale. Wait, but since the Cartan matrix for the dual root system is the transpose of the original Cartan matrix, which for G2 is not symmetric. Wait, but in G2, the Cartan matrix is not symmetric, so its dual root system would have the transpose Cartan matrix, which would correspond to swapping the roots. But in G2, the roots have different lengths, so the dual root system would have the Cartan matrix with entries swapped. However, since G2 is its own dual under the scaling of roots. Let me check if the dual root system is isomorphic to G2.

Wait, if the original roots are long and short, then the coroots would be short and long, respectively. Because α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If α is long, say (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2/3 α, which would be a shorter root. If β is short, (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β, which is longer. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ would have roots that are the coroots of R, which in G2 case are scaled such that the long roots become short and vice versa. But since G2 is self-dual in the sense that the dual root system is isomorphic to the original, just with roots scaled. Therefore, R∨ is isomorphic to R, so the base B∨ would correspond to the base of R∨, which is isomorphic, so yes, B∨ is a base. 

Wait, but if we take the simple roots in G2 as α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ (short) and β∨ (long). Then B∨ would consist of a short root and a long root. In the dual root system R∨, which is isomorphic to G2, the simple roots are these coroots. So, in effect, the base B∨ is a set of simple roots for R∨, which is isomorphic to G2. Therefore, yes, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in all these examples, the set of simple coroots B∨ is indeed a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, perhaps the answer is yes. But I need to ensure there isn&#x27;t some root system where this fails. 

Alternatively, let&#x27;s think abstractly. Since the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same, the chambers are the same. The base for R corresponding to chamber C is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. The base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the set of simple roots δ1, ..., δl in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, δi∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δi∨ = δi (since for R∨, the coroots are the original roots). Wait, no. Wait, in the dual root system R∨, the coroots are (α∨)∨ = α. So if we take R∨, its coroots are the original roots. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = 0} where δ is a root in R∨, i.e., δ = α∨ for some α in R. But δ∨ = (α∨)∨ = α. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = Hα, which are the same as hyperplanes for R. Therefore, as before, chambers are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for those roots. But in R∨, the positive half-space for a root δ ∈ R∨ is defined by ⟨x, δ∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δ ∈ R∨ means δ = β∨ for some β ∈ R. Therefore, ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = ⟨x, (β∨)∨⟩ = ⟨x, β⟩. Therefore, the positive half-space for δ = β∨ is ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all simple roots αi. So if we want the base for R∨, we need the simple roots δj in R∨ such that ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 defines C. But δj∨ = βj, so this becomes ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original system, the chamber C is also defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, if the set of βj is such that ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, then βj must be related to αi∨. 

Wait, this seems a bit circular. Let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have the chamber C. For the original root system R, the simple roots αi are the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. For the dual root system R∨, the simple roots δj must be the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δj∨ is in R, since δj is in R∨. So δj∨ = αj. Therefore, the condition ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, for the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. But in the original system, C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Therefore, unless ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 and ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 define the same chamber, which is only the case if αj and αj∨ are scalar multiples. But αj∨ = 2αj/(αj, αj). Therefore, αj∨ is a scalar multiple of αj. Hence, the half-space ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is the same as ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 if and only if the scalar is positive, which it is. Since 2/(αj, αj) is positive, then yes, ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the chamber C is defined equivalently by either ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 or ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, in the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the set of simple roots for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the set of δj such that δj∨ = αj, which implies δj = αj∨. Therefore, the simple roots for R∨ are exactly the simple coroots B∨. 

Therefore, this shows that the set B∨ is indeed the base for the dual root system R∨ corresponding to the chamber C. 

Thus, in general, the simple coroots B∨ form a base for the dual root system R∨. 

But let me verify once again. Suppose that in the dual root system R∨, the simple roots are the simple coroots of R. Then the positive coroots in R∨ would be the non-negative linear combinations of the simple coroots. But in R∨, the roots are the coroots of R, so the positive coroots would correspond to the positive roots in R∨. But a positive root in R∨ is a coroot that is a non-negative combination of the simple coroots. However, in the original system, the positive roots are non-negative combinations of the simple roots. There&#x27;s a duality here. 

For example, in the original root system, a positive root is a sum of simple roots with non-negative coefficients. The coroot of a positive root is a positive coroot, but the positive coroots are not necessarily the same as the non-negative combinations of simple coroots. Wait, but if B∨ is a base for R∨, then every positive coroot in R∨ is a non-negative combination of B∨. Let me check with B2 example. 

In B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The positive roots are α, β, α + β, α + 2β. The coroots would be α∨ = α, β∨ = 2β. The positive coroots are α, 2β, α + 2β, 2α + 4β. Wait, no. Wait, the coroots of the roots are:

For α: α∨ = α.

For β: β∨ = 2β.

For α + β: (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/(α + β, α + β). Let&#x27;s compute (α + β, α + β) = (α, α) + 2(α, β) + (β, β). In B2, (α, α) = 2, (β, β) = 1, and (α, β) = -1. Therefore, (α + β, α + β) = 2 + 2*(-1) + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Therefore, (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/1 = 2α + 2β.

Similarly, for α + 2β: (α + 2β, α + 2β) = (α, α) + 4(α, β) + 4(β, β) = 2 + 4*(-1) + 4*1 = 2 -4 +4 = 2. Therefore, (α + 2β)∨ = 2(α + 2β)/2 = α + 2β.

Therefore, the positive coroots in R∨ are α, 2β, 2α + 2β, and α + 2β. 

Now, the simple coroots B∨ = {α∨, β∨} = {α, 2β}. The positive coroots in R∨ should be the non-negative combinations of α and 2β. Let&#x27;s see:

- α is a non-negative combination of α and 2β (1*α + 0*2β).
- 2β is 0*α + 1*2β.
- 2α + 2β is 2*α + 1*2β.
- α + 2β is 1*α + 1*2β.

Therefore, all positive coroots in R∨ are indeed non-negative combinations of the simple coroots B∨. Therefore, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Similarly, if we take a positive coroot like 2α + 2β, which is not a coroot of a simple root, but it is a combination of the simple coroots. Therefore, B∨ satisfies the conditions of a base. 

Hence, through these examples and abstract reasoning, it seems that the simple coroots B∨ indeed form a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the set of simple coroots \( B^\vee = \{\alpha_1^\vee, \ldots, \alpha_l^\vee\} \) forms a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \), we need to verify if \( B^\vee \) satisfies the properties of a base in the dual root system. 

1. **Hyperplanes and Chambers**: The hyperplanes for the dual root system \( R^\vee \) are the same as those for the original root system \( R \). This is because the coroot of a coroot \( (\alpha^\vee)^\vee \) is the original root \( \alpha \). Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of these hyperplanes, are the same for both \( R \) and \( R^\vee \).

2. **Base Definition**: A base for a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of these simple roots with all coefficients integers of the same sign. For \( B^\vee \) to be a base for \( R^\vee \), every coroot \( \beta^\vee \in R^\vee \) must be expressible as a non-negative or non-positive integer combination of the simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \).

3. **Duality Relationship**: The dual root system \( R^\vee \) consists of coroots \( \alpha^\vee \) for each root \( \alpha \in R \). The simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \) are scaled versions of the simple roots \( \alpha_i \). For a chamber \( C \), the base \( B \) of \( R \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i^\vee \rangle &gt; 0 \). For the dual root system \( R^\vee \), the same chamber \( C \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i \rangle &gt; 0 \), which is equivalent due to the scaling relationship between roots and coroots.

4. **Verification with Examples**: Checking examples such as \( A_1 \), \( A_2 \), \( B_2 \), and \( G_2 \) confirms that the simple coroots form a base for the dual root system. In each case, the simple coroots correspond to the simple roots of the dual system, ensuring that all positive coroots in \( R^\vee \) are non-negative combinations of the simple coroots.

Thus, the set \( B^\vee \) of simple coroots is indeed a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the set of simple coroots B∨ is always a base for the dual root system R∨. Let me start by recalling some definitions and properties related to root systems, dual root systems, chambers, and bases. 

First, a root system (V, R) consists of a finite set R of non-zero vectors (roots) in a Euclidean space V that satisfy certain axioms, like being closed under reflections and having rational Cartan numbers. The dual root system (V∨, R∨) is formed by taking the coroots α∨ = 2α/(α, α) for each root α in R. 

A chamber C, also known as a Weyl chamber, is a connected component of the complement in V of all the hyperplanes Hα = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0}. Each chamber is an open convex cone, and the group generated by the reflections over the hyperplanes Hα (the Weyl group) acts simply transitively on the chambers. 

For a given chamber C, the corresponding base B = B(C) is the unique set of simple roots {α1, ..., αl} such that C is defined by the intersection of the positive half-spaces determined by the simple roots. That is, C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. The simple roots form a basis of the vector space V and also a basis over the integers for the root lattice. 

Now, the question is whether the set B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} of simple coroots forms a base for the dual root system R∨. To check this, I need to verify if B∨ satisfies the properties of a base when considered in the dual root system. 

A base of a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of the base elements with all coefficients integers of the same sign (either all non-negative or all non-positive). So, for B∨ to be a base of R∨, every coroot β∨ in R∨ should be expressible as a linear combination of the αi∨ with coefficients all non-negative or all non-negative integers. 

First, note that the coroots α∨ are themselves roots in the dual root system R∨. So, B∨ is a subset of R∨. The key point is whether B∨ is a base in the sense of root systems for R∨. 

Given that dual root systems have a duality relationship, I suspect that the simple coroots should form a base for the dual system. However, I need to confirm this carefully. 

Let me recall that in the original root system R, the simple roots B = {α1, ..., αl} form a basis for V and define the positive roots R+ as those roots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple roots. Similarly, the positive coroots R∨+ would be those coroots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple coroots B∨. 

But wait, the coroot of a positive root is not necessarily a positive coroot. Let me check: If β is a positive root in R, then β = Σ niαi with ni ≥ 0. Then β∨ = 2β/(β, β). But how does this relate to the simple coroots? 

Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is that the dual root system R∨ has its own set of simple roots, which may or may not coincide with the simple coroots. 

Alternatively, since the dual of a root system is another root system, with the roles of roots and coroots swapped, perhaps the simple coroots in the original system correspond to the simple roots in the dual system. 

Wait, the coroot system R∨ is a root system in V∨, which is the dual space of V. But if V is equipped with an inner product, we can identify V with V∨, so perhaps they are considered in the same space. Wait, but actually, the coroot α∨ is defined as 2α/(α, α), so if we have a root α in V, then α∨ is in V as well, scaled by 2/(α, α). So the dual root system R∨ is in the same space V, not the dual space. That seems right because the definition of root systems usually includes being in a Euclidean space, and the dual roots are scaled versions. 

Therefore, R∨ is a root system in V, same as R. So the chambers for R∨ would be connected components of V minus the hyperplanes Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, (α∨)∨⟩ = 0}. But (α∨)∨ is equal to α, since the coroot of a coroot is the original root. So Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α⟩ = 0} = Hα. Wait, so the hyperplanes for R∨ are the same as the hyperplanes for R? 

Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s check. For the dual root system R∨, the hyperplanes would be Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β∨∨⟩ = 0}. But β∨ is a root in R∨, so (β∨)∨ = β∨∨ = 2β∨/(β∨, β∨). But β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = 2*(2β/(β, β)) / (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)).

Calculating the inner product in the denominator: (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)) = 4/(β, β)^2 * (β, β) = 4/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = (4β/(β, β)) / (4/(β, β)) ) = β. 

Hence, (β∨)∨ = β. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β⟩ = 0}, which are exactly the same as the hyperplanes Hβ for the original root system R. 

Therefore, the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same. Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of the hyperplanes, are the same for both root systems. 

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. If the hyperplanes are the same, then the chambers are the same. So a chamber C for R is also a chamber for R∨. 

But then, the base B(C) for R is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for each αi in B. Similarly, the base for R∨ corresponding to the same chamber C would be the set of simple roots for R∨, which are the simple coroots? Wait, but the simple roots for R∨ would be the set B∨?

But if the chambers are the same, then the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C should be the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of their positive half-spaces. But in R∨, the positive half-spaces are defined by ⟨x, β∨⟩ &gt; 0 for β∨ in R∨. But since β∨∨ = β, this is equivalent to ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. Wait, but in the original root system, the hyperplanes are defined by ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0. So the positive half-spaces for R∨ would be defined by ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0, where β is a root in R. But these are the same as the positive half-spaces for R, except that in R, the half-spaces are ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let&#x27;s clarify.

In the original root system R, the simple roots α1, ..., αl are such that the chamber C is the set of x in V where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

In the dual root system R∨, the roots are the coroots α∨ for α in R. The chamber for R∨ would be defined in terms of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots in R∨, which are the same hyperplanes as in R. So the chambers for R and R∨ are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the unique set of simple roots β1∨, ..., βl∨ in R∨ such that C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. But since βi∨∨ = βi, this is equivalent to C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. Therefore, in order for B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} to be the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C, we need that C is the set of x where ⟨x, αi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. But since αi∨∨ = αi, this would mean C is the set where ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

However, in the original definition, C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, unless ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is not generally true, these conditions are different. 

Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me check with an example. Let&#x27;s take the root system A1, which is just {α, -α}, with α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If we take the chamber C to be the positive half-line where ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, α⟩ &gt; 0 since α∨ is a positive multiple of α. So in this case, the chamber C is the same whether we use α or α∨. Hence, in this case, the simple coroot α∨ would generate the same chamber as α. 

But wait, in this case, since A1 is self-dual (since α∨ is just a scalar multiple of α), the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, the base for R∨ would just be the same as the base for R. 

But in higher rank root systems, perhaps this is different. Let&#x27;s consider the root system A2, which consists of the roots in the two-dimensional space with simple roots α1 and α2 at 120 degrees. The coroots α1∨ and α2∨ are scaled versions of α1 and α2. Specifically, if α1 and α2 have the same length, then the coroots would be the same roots scaled by 2/(α, α). For example, in the standard normalization where (α, α) = 2, the coroot α∨ is equal to α. But if (α, α) = 1, then α∨ = 2α. 

Wait, in the root system A2, all roots have the same length. Let&#x27;s say the roots are vectors in Euclidean space with length √2, so that (α, α) = 2. Then α∨ = 2α/(α, α) = α. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, in this case, the simple coroots are the same as the simple roots, so B∨ = B, and hence B∨ is a base for R∨, which is R itself. So in this case, yes, B∨ is a base. 

But suppose we have a root system where roots have different lengths, say B2 or G2. Let&#x27;s take B2. In B2, there are long and short roots. Let me recall that in B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The coroots would be α∨ = 2α/(α, α) and β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Since α is long, (α, α) is larger than (β, β). For example, in B2, we can take α = e1 - e2 and β = e2, with (α, α) = 2 and (β, β) = 1. Then α∨ = 2α/2 = α, and β∨ = 2β/1 = 2β. So the coroots in B2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ consists of the roots α and 2β and their negatives, which is actually the root system C2. 

So, in this case, R∨ is of type C2, and the simple coroots for B2 are α and 2β. But in the dual root system C2, the simple roots are different. Wait, the dual root system of B2 is C2, where the simple roots are the coroots of B2. However, in C2, the simple roots are the coroots of B2, so the simple roots for C2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the base B∨ = {α, 2β} is indeed the base for the dual root system C2. 

Wait, but in C2, the simple roots are usually denoted as γ1 and γ2, where γ1 is long and γ2 is short. But in our case, if B2 has simple roots α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ = α and β∨ = 2β, which are the simple roots for C2. Therefore, B∨ is indeed a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in this case, the answer is yes. But let me verify another example. Take G2, which is more complicated. In G2, there are long and short roots, with the ratio of squared lengths being 3. The dual root system of G2 is still G2, since it is self-dual. Wait, but actually, in G2, the roots and coroots have the same length ratio because the ratio of the squares is 3, so when you take coroots, you invert the scaling. Wait, if α is a long root with (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2α/3, and if β is a short root with (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β. So the dual root system would consist of roots 2α/3 and 2β. But is this isomorphic to G2? Wait, G2 is self-dual because the dual of a root system is determined by the inverse of the Cartan matrix, and G2 is simply-laced in some sense? No, G2 is not simply-laced. Wait, maybe it&#x27;s self-dual. Let me recall that in G2, the Cartan matrix is:

[ 2 -3 ]

[-1 2 ]

The inverse of this matrix is:

[2  3]

[1  2] 

divided by determinant, which is 4 - 3 = 1. So the inverse Cartan matrix is the same as the transpose, which would be the Cartan matrix of the dual root system. But since the inverse is not the same as the original, unless we rescale. Wait, but since the Cartan matrix for the dual root system is the transpose of the original Cartan matrix, which for G2 is not symmetric. Wait, but in G2, the Cartan matrix is not symmetric, so its dual root system would have the transpose Cartan matrix, which would correspond to swapping the roots. But in G2, the roots have different lengths, so the dual root system would have the Cartan matrix with entries swapped. However, since G2 is its own dual under the scaling of roots. Let me check if the dual root system is isomorphic to G2.

Wait, if the original roots are long and short, then the coroots would be short and long, respectively. Because α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If α is long, say (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2/3 α, which would be a shorter root. If β is short, (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β, which is longer. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ would have roots that are the coroots of R, which in G2 case are scaled such that the long roots become short and vice versa. But since G2 is self-dual in the sense that the dual root system is isomorphic to the original, just with roots scaled. Therefore, R∨ is isomorphic to R, so the base B∨ would correspond to the base of R∨, which is isomorphic, so yes, B∨ is a base. 

Wait, but if we take the simple roots in G2 as α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ (short) and β∨ (long). Then B∨ would consist of a short root and a long root. In the dual root system R∨, which is isomorphic to G2, the simple roots are these coroots. So, in effect, the base B∨ is a set of simple roots for R∨, which is isomorphic to G2. Therefore, yes, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in all these examples, the set of simple coroots B∨ is indeed a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, perhaps the answer is yes. But I need to ensure there isn&#x27;t some root system where this fails. 

Alternatively, let&#x27;s think abstractly. Since the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same, the chambers are the same. The base for R corresponding to chamber C is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. The base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the set of simple roots δ1, ..., δl in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, δi∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δi∨ = δi (since for R∨, the coroots are the original roots). Wait, no. Wait, in the dual root system R∨, the coroots are (α∨)∨ = α. So if we take R∨, its coroots are the original roots. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = 0} where δ is a root in R∨, i.e., δ = α∨ for some α in R. But δ∨ = (α∨)∨ = α. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = Hα, which are the same as hyperplanes for R. Therefore, as before, chambers are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for those roots. But in R∨, the positive half-space for a root δ ∈ R∨ is defined by ⟨x, δ∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δ ∈ R∨ means δ = β∨ for some β ∈ R. Therefore, ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = ⟨x, (β∨)∨⟩ = ⟨x, β⟩. Therefore, the positive half-space for δ = β∨ is ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all simple roots αi. So if we want the base for R∨, we need the simple roots δj in R∨ such that ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 defines C. But δj∨ = βj, so this becomes ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original system, the chamber C is also defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, if the set of βj is such that ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, then βj must be related to αi∨. 

Wait, this seems a bit circular. Let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have the chamber C. For the original root system R, the simple roots αi are the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. For the dual root system R∨, the simple roots δj must be the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δj∨ is in R, since δj is in R∨. So δj∨ = αj. Therefore, the condition ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, for the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. But in the original system, C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Therefore, unless ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 and ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 define the same chamber, which is only the case if αj and αj∨ are scalar multiples. But αj∨ = 2αj/(αj, αj). Therefore, αj∨ is a scalar multiple of αj. Hence, the half-space ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is the same as ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 if and only if the scalar is positive, which it is. Since 2/(αj, αj) is positive, then yes, ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the chamber C is defined equivalently by either ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 or ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, in the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the set of simple roots for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the set of δj such that δj∨ = αj, which implies δj = αj∨. Therefore, the simple roots for R∨ are exactly the simple coroots B∨. 

Therefore, this shows that the set B∨ is indeed the base for the dual root system R∨ corresponding to the chamber C. 

Thus, in general, the simple coroots B∨ form a base for the dual root system R∨. 

But let me verify once again. Suppose that in the dual root system R∨, the simple roots are the simple coroots of R. Then the positive coroots in R∨ would be the non-negative linear combinations of the simple coroots. But in R∨, the roots are the coroots of R, so the positive coroots would correspond to the positive roots in R∨. But a positive root in R∨ is a coroot that is a non-negative combination of the simple coroots. However, in the original system, the positive roots are non-negative combinations of the simple roots. There&#x27;s a duality here. 

For example, in the original root system, a positive root is a sum of simple roots with non-negative coefficients. The coroot of a positive root is a positive coroot, but the positive coroots are not necessarily the same as the non-negative combinations of simple coroots. Wait, but if B∨ is a base for R∨, then every positive coroot in R∨ is a non-negative combination of B∨. Let me check with B2 example. 

In B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The positive roots are α, β, α + β, α + 2β. The coroots would be α∨ = α, β∨ = 2β. The positive coroots are α, 2β, α + 2β, 2α + 4β. Wait, no. Wait, the coroots of the roots are:

For α: α∨ = α.

For β: β∨ = 2β.

For α + β: (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/(α + β, α + β). Let&#x27;s compute (α + β, α + β) = (α, α) + 2(α, β) + (β, β). In B2, (α, α) = 2, (β, β) = 1, and (α, β) = -1. Therefore, (α + β, α + β) = 2 + 2*(-1) + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Therefore, (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/1 = 2α + 2β.

Similarly, for α + 2β: (α + 2β, α + 2β) = (α, α) + 4(α, β) + 4(β, β) = 2 + 4*(-1) + 4*1 = 2 -4 +4 = 2. Therefore, (α + 2β)∨ = 2(α + 2β)/2 = α + 2β.

Therefore, the positive coroots in R∨ are α, 2β, 2α + 2β, and α + 2β. 

Now, the simple coroots B∨ = {α∨, β∨} = {α, 2β}. The positive coroots in R∨ should be the non-negative combinations of α and 2β. Let&#x27;s see:

- α is a non-negative combination of α and 2β (1*α + 0*2β).
- 2β is 0*α + 1*2β.
- 2α + 2β is 2*α + 1*2β.
- α + 2β is 1*α + 1*2β.

Therefore, all positive coroots in R∨ are indeed non-negative combinations of the simple coroots B∨. Therefore, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Similarly, if we take a positive coroot like 2α + 2β, which is not a coroot of a simple root, but it is a combination of the simple coroots. Therefore, B∨ satisfies the conditions of a base. 

Hence, through these examples and abstract reasoning, it seems that the simple coroots B∨ indeed form a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the set of simple coroots \( B^\vee = \{\alpha_1^\vee, \ldots, \alpha_l^\vee\} \) forms a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \), we need to verify if \( B^\vee \) satisfies the properties of a base in the dual root system. 

1. **Hyperplanes and Chambers**: The hyperplanes for the dual root system \( R^\vee \) are the same as those for the original root system \( R \). This is because the coroot of a coroot \( (\alpha^\vee)^\vee \) is the original root \( \alpha \). Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of these hyperplanes, are the same for both \( R \) and \( R^\vee \).

2. **Base Definition**: A base for a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of these simple roots with all coefficients integers of the same sign. For \( B^\vee \) to be a base for \( R^\vee \), every coroot \( \beta^\vee \in R^\vee \) must be expressible as a non-negative or non-positive integer combination of the simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \).

3. **Duality Relationship**: The dual root system \( R^\vee \) consists of coroots \( \alpha^\vee \) for each root \( \alpha \in R \). The simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \) are scaled versions of the simple roots \( \alpha_i \). For a chamber \( C \), the base \( B \) of \( R \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i^\vee \rangle &gt; 0 \). For the dual root system \( R^\vee \), the same chamber \( C \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i \rangle &gt; 0 \), which is equivalent due to the scaling relationship between roots and coroots.

4. **Verification with Examples**: Checking examples such as \( A_1 \), \( A_2 \), \( B_2 \), and \( G_2 \) confirms that the simple coroots form a base for the dual root system. In each case, the simple coroots correspond to the simple roots of the dual system, ensuring that all positive coroots in \( R^\vee \) are non-negative combinations of the simple coroots.

Thus, the set \( B^\vee \) of simple coroots is indeed a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the set of simple coroots B∨ is always a base for the dual root system R∨. Let me start by recalling some definitions and properties related to root systems, dual root systems, chambers, and bases. 

First, a root system (V, R) consists of a finite set R of non-zero vectors (roots) in a Euclidean space V that satisfy certain axioms, like being closed under reflections and having rational Cartan numbers. The dual root system (V∨, R∨) is formed by taking the coroots α∨ = 2α/(α, α) for each root α in R. 

A chamber C, also known as a Weyl chamber, is a connected component of the complement in V of all the hyperplanes Hα = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0}. Each chamber is an open convex cone, and the group generated by the reflections over the hyperplanes Hα (the Weyl group) acts simply transitively on the chambers. 

For a given chamber C, the corresponding base B = B(C) is the unique set of simple roots {α1, ..., αl} such that C is defined by the intersection of the positive half-spaces determined by the simple roots. That is, C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. The simple roots form a basis of the vector space V and also a basis over the integers for the root lattice. 

Now, the question is whether the set B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} of simple coroots forms a base for the dual root system R∨. To check this, I need to verify if B∨ satisfies the properties of a base when considered in the dual root system. 

A base of a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of the base elements with all coefficients integers of the same sign (either all non-negative or all non-positive). So, for B∨ to be a base of R∨, every coroot β∨ in R∨ should be expressible as a linear combination of the αi∨ with coefficients all non-negative or all non-negative integers. 

First, note that the coroots α∨ are themselves roots in the dual root system R∨. So, B∨ is a subset of R∨. The key point is whether B∨ is a base in the sense of root systems for R∨. 

Given that dual root systems have a duality relationship, I suspect that the simple coroots should form a base for the dual system. However, I need to confirm this carefully. 

Let me recall that in the original root system R, the simple roots B = {α1, ..., αl} form a basis for V and define the positive roots R+ as those roots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple roots. Similarly, the positive coroots R∨+ would be those coroots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple coroots B∨. 

But wait, the coroot of a positive root is not necessarily a positive coroot. Let me check: If β is a positive root in R, then β = Σ niαi with ni ≥ 0. Then β∨ = 2β/(β, β). But how does this relate to the simple coroots? 

Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is that the dual root system R∨ has its own set of simple roots, which may or may not coincide with the simple coroots. 

Alternatively, since the dual of a root system is another root system, with the roles of roots and coroots swapped, perhaps the simple coroots in the original system correspond to the simple roots in the dual system. 

Wait, the coroot system R∨ is a root system in V∨, which is the dual space of V. But if V is equipped with an inner product, we can identify V with V∨, so perhaps they are considered in the same space. Wait, but actually, the coroot α∨ is defined as 2α/(α, α), so if we have a root α in V, then α∨ is in V as well, scaled by 2/(α, α). So the dual root system R∨ is in the same space V, not the dual space. That seems right because the definition of root systems usually includes being in a Euclidean space, and the dual roots are scaled versions. 

Therefore, R∨ is a root system in V, same as R. So the chambers for R∨ would be connected components of V minus the hyperplanes Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, (α∨)∨⟩ = 0}. But (α∨)∨ is equal to α, since the coroot of a coroot is the original root. So Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α⟩ = 0} = Hα. Wait, so the hyperplanes for R∨ are the same as the hyperplanes for R? 

Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s check. For the dual root system R∨, the hyperplanes would be Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β∨∨⟩ = 0}. But β∨ is a root in R∨, so (β∨)∨ = β∨∨ = 2β∨/(β∨, β∨). But β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = 2*(2β/(β, β)) / (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)).

Calculating the inner product in the denominator: (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)) = 4/(β, β)^2 * (β, β) = 4/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = (4β/(β, β)) / (4/(β, β)) ) = β. 

Hence, (β∨)∨ = β. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β⟩ = 0}, which are exactly the same as the hyperplanes Hβ for the original root system R. 

Therefore, the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same. Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of the hyperplanes, are the same for both root systems. 

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. If the hyperplanes are the same, then the chambers are the same. So a chamber C for R is also a chamber for R∨. 

But then, the base B(C) for R is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for each αi in B. Similarly, the base for R∨ corresponding to the same chamber C would be the set of simple roots for R∨, which are the simple coroots? Wait, but the simple roots for R∨ would be the set B∨?

But if the chambers are the same, then the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C should be the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of their positive half-spaces. But in R∨, the positive half-spaces are defined by ⟨x, β∨⟩ &gt; 0 for β∨ in R∨. But since β∨∨ = β, this is equivalent to ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. Wait, but in the original root system, the hyperplanes are defined by ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0. So the positive half-spaces for R∨ would be defined by ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0, where β is a root in R. But these are the same as the positive half-spaces for R, except that in R, the half-spaces are ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let&#x27;s clarify.

In the original root system R, the simple roots α1, ..., αl are such that the chamber C is the set of x in V where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

In the dual root system R∨, the roots are the coroots α∨ for α in R. The chamber for R∨ would be defined in terms of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots in R∨, which are the same hyperplanes as in R. So the chambers for R and R∨ are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the unique set of simple roots β1∨, ..., βl∨ in R∨ such that C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. But since βi∨∨ = βi, this is equivalent to C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. Therefore, in order for B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} to be the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C, we need that C is the set of x where ⟨x, αi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. But since αi∨∨ = αi, this would mean C is the set where ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

However, in the original definition, C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, unless ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is not generally true, these conditions are different. 

Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me check with an example. Let&#x27;s take the root system A1, which is just {α, -α}, with α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If we take the chamber C to be the positive half-line where ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, α⟩ &gt; 0 since α∨ is a positive multiple of α. So in this case, the chamber C is the same whether we use α or α∨. Hence, in this case, the simple coroot α∨ would generate the same chamber as α. 

But wait, in this case, since A1 is self-dual (since α∨ is just a scalar multiple of α), the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, the base for R∨ would just be the same as the base for R. 

But in higher rank root systems, perhaps this is different. Let&#x27;s consider the root system A2, which consists of the roots in the two-dimensional space with simple roots α1 and α2 at 120 degrees. The coroots α1∨ and α2∨ are scaled versions of α1 and α2. Specifically, if α1 and α2 have the same length, then the coroots would be the same roots scaled by 2/(α, α). For example, in the standard normalization where (α, α) = 2, the coroot α∨ is equal to α. But if (α, α) = 1, then α∨ = 2α. 

Wait, in the root system A2, all roots have the same length. Let&#x27;s say the roots are vectors in Euclidean space with length √2, so that (α, α) = 2. Then α∨ = 2α/(α, α) = α. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, in this case, the simple coroots are the same as the simple roots, so B∨ = B, and hence B∨ is a base for R∨, which is R itself. So in this case, yes, B∨ is a base. 

But suppose we have a root system where roots have different lengths, say B2 or G2. Let&#x27;s take B2. In B2, there are long and short roots. Let me recall that in B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The coroots would be α∨ = 2α/(α, α) and β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Since α is long, (α, α) is larger than (β, β). For example, in B2, we can take α = e1 - e2 and β = e2, with (α, α) = 2 and (β, β) = 1. Then α∨ = 2α/2 = α, and β∨ = 2β/1 = 2β. So the coroots in B2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ consists of the roots α and 2β and their negatives, which is actually the root system C2. 

So, in this case, R∨ is of type C2, and the simple coroots for B2 are α and 2β. But in the dual root system C2, the simple roots are different. Wait, the dual root system of B2 is C2, where the simple roots are the coroots of B2. However, in C2, the simple roots are the coroots of B2, so the simple roots for C2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the base B∨ = {α, 2β} is indeed the base for the dual root system C2. 

Wait, but in C2, the simple roots are usually denoted as γ1 and γ2, where γ1 is long and γ2 is short. But in our case, if B2 has simple roots α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ = α and β∨ = 2β, which are the simple roots for C2. Therefore, B∨ is indeed a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in this case, the answer is yes. But let me verify another example. Take G2, which is more complicated. In G2, there are long and short roots, with the ratio of squared lengths being 3. The dual root system of G2 is still G2, since it is self-dual. Wait, but actually, in G2, the roots and coroots have the same length ratio because the ratio of the squares is 3, so when you take coroots, you invert the scaling. Wait, if α is a long root with (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2α/3, and if β is a short root with (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β. So the dual root system would consist of roots 2α/3 and 2β. But is this isomorphic to G2? Wait, G2 is self-dual because the dual of a root system is determined by the inverse of the Cartan matrix, and G2 is simply-laced in some sense? No, G2 is not simply-laced. Wait, maybe it&#x27;s self-dual. Let me recall that in G2, the Cartan matrix is:

[ 2 -3 ]

[-1 2 ]

The inverse of this matrix is:

[2  3]

[1  2] 

divided by determinant, which is 4 - 3 = 1. So the inverse Cartan matrix is the same as the transpose, which would be the Cartan matrix of the dual root system. But since the inverse is not the same as the original, unless we rescale. Wait, but since the Cartan matrix for the dual root system is the transpose of the original Cartan matrix, which for G2 is not symmetric. Wait, but in G2, the Cartan matrix is not symmetric, so its dual root system would have the transpose Cartan matrix, which would correspond to swapping the roots. But in G2, the roots have different lengths, so the dual root system would have the Cartan matrix with entries swapped. However, since G2 is its own dual under the scaling of roots. Let me check if the dual root system is isomorphic to G2.

Wait, if the original roots are long and short, then the coroots would be short and long, respectively. Because α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If α is long, say (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2/3 α, which would be a shorter root. If β is short, (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β, which is longer. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ would have roots that are the coroots of R, which in G2 case are scaled such that the long roots become short and vice versa. But since G2 is self-dual in the sense that the dual root system is isomorphic to the original, just with roots scaled. Therefore, R∨ is isomorphic to R, so the base B∨ would correspond to the base of R∨, which is isomorphic, so yes, B∨ is a base. 

Wait, but if we take the simple roots in G2 as α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ (short) and β∨ (long). Then B∨ would consist of a short root and a long root. In the dual root system R∨, which is isomorphic to G2, the simple roots are these coroots. So, in effect, the base B∨ is a set of simple roots for R∨, which is isomorphic to G2. Therefore, yes, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in all these examples, the set of simple coroots B∨ is indeed a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, perhaps the answer is yes. But I need to ensure there isn&#x27;t some root system where this fails. 

Alternatively, let&#x27;s think abstractly. Since the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same, the chambers are the same. The base for R corresponding to chamber C is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. The base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the set of simple roots δ1, ..., δl in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, δi∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δi∨ = δi (since for R∨, the coroots are the original roots). Wait, no. Wait, in the dual root system R∨, the coroots are (α∨)∨ = α. So if we take R∨, its coroots are the original roots. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = 0} where δ is a root in R∨, i.e., δ = α∨ for some α in R. But δ∨ = (α∨)∨ = α. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = Hα, which are the same as hyperplanes for R. Therefore, as before, chambers are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for those roots. But in R∨, the positive half-space for a root δ ∈ R∨ is defined by ⟨x, δ∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δ ∈ R∨ means δ = β∨ for some β ∈ R. Therefore, ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = ⟨x, (β∨)∨⟩ = ⟨x, β⟩. Therefore, the positive half-space for δ = β∨ is ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all simple roots αi. So if we want the base for R∨, we need the simple roots δj in R∨ such that ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 defines C. But δj∨ = βj, so this becomes ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original system, the chamber C is also defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, if the set of βj is such that ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, then βj must be related to αi∨. 

Wait, this seems a bit circular. Let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have the chamber C. For the original root system R, the simple roots αi are the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. For the dual root system R∨, the simple roots δj must be the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δj∨ is in R, since δj is in R∨. So δj∨ = αj. Therefore, the condition ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, for the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. But in the original system, C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Therefore, unless ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 and ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 define the same chamber, which is only the case if αj and αj∨ are scalar multiples. But αj∨ = 2αj/(αj, αj). Therefore, αj∨ is a scalar multiple of αj. Hence, the half-space ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is the same as ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 if and only if the scalar is positive, which it is. Since 2/(αj, αj) is positive, then yes, ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the chamber C is defined equivalently by either ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 or ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, in the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the set of simple roots for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the set of δj such that δj∨ = αj, which implies δj = αj∨. Therefore, the simple roots for R∨ are exactly the simple coroots B∨. 

Therefore, this shows that the set B∨ is indeed the base for the dual root system R∨ corresponding to the chamber C. 

Thus, in general, the simple coroots B∨ form a base for the dual root system R∨. 

But let me verify once again. Suppose that in the dual root system R∨, the simple roots are the simple coroots of R. Then the positive coroots in R∨ would be the non-negative linear combinations of the simple coroots. But in R∨, the roots are the coroots of R, so the positive coroots would correspond to the positive roots in R∨. But a positive root in R∨ is a coroot that is a non-negative combination of the simple coroots. However, in the original system, the positive roots are non-negative combinations of the simple roots. There&#x27;s a duality here. 

For example, in the original root system, a positive root is a sum of simple roots with non-negative coefficients. The coroot of a positive root is a positive coroot, but the positive coroots are not necessarily the same as the non-negative combinations of simple coroots. Wait, but if B∨ is a base for R∨, then every positive coroot in R∨ is a non-negative combination of B∨. Let me check with B2 example. 

In B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The positive roots are α, β, α + β, α + 2β. The coroots would be α∨ = α, β∨ = 2β. The positive coroots are α, 2β, α + 2β, 2α + 4β. Wait, no. Wait, the coroots of the roots are:

For α: α∨ = α.

For β: β∨ = 2β.

For α + β: (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/(α + β, α + β). Let&#x27;s compute (α + β, α + β) = (α, α) + 2(α, β) + (β, β). In B2, (α, α) = 2, (β, β) = 1, and (α, β) = -1. Therefore, (α + β, α + β) = 2 + 2*(-1) + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Therefore, (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/1 = 2α + 2β.

Similarly, for α + 2β: (α + 2β, α + 2β) = (α, α) + 4(α, β) + 4(β, β) = 2 + 4*(-1) + 4*1 = 2 -4 +4 = 2. Therefore, (α + 2β)∨ = 2(α + 2β)/2 = α + 2β.

Therefore, the positive coroots in R∨ are α, 2β, 2α + 2β, and α + 2β. 

Now, the simple coroots B∨ = {α∨, β∨} = {α, 2β}. The positive coroots in R∨ should be the non-negative combinations of α and 2β. Let&#x27;s see:

- α is a non-negative combination of α and 2β (1*α + 0*2β).
- 2β is 0*α + 1*2β.
- 2α + 2β is 2*α + 1*2β.
- α + 2β is 1*α + 1*2β.

Therefore, all positive coroots in R∨ are indeed non-negative combinations of the simple coroots B∨. Therefore, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Similarly, if we take a positive coroot like 2α + 2β, which is not a coroot of a simple root, but it is a combination of the simple coroots. Therefore, B∨ satisfies the conditions of a base. 

Hence, through these examples and abstract reasoning, it seems that the simple coroots B∨ indeed form a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the set of simple coroots \( B^\vee = \{\alpha_1^\vee, \ldots, \alpha_l^\vee\} \) forms a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \), we need to verify if \( B^\vee \) satisfies the properties of a base in the dual root system. 

1. **Hyperplanes and Chambers**: The hyperplanes for the dual root system \( R^\vee \) are the same as those for the original root system \( R \). This is because the coroot of a coroot \( (\alpha^\vee)^\vee \) is the original root \( \alpha \). Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of these hyperplanes, are the same for both \( R \) and \( R^\vee \).

2. **Base Definition**: A base for a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of these simple roots with all coefficients integers of the same sign. For \( B^\vee \) to be a base for \( R^\vee \), every coroot \( \beta^\vee \in R^\vee \) must be expressible as a non-negative or non-positive integer combination of the simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \).

3. **Duality Relationship**: The dual root system \( R^\vee \) consists of coroots \( \alpha^\vee \) for each root \( \alpha \in R \). The simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \) are scaled versions of the simple roots \( \alpha_i \). For a chamber \( C \), the base \( B \) of \( R \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i^\vee \rangle &gt; 0 \). For the dual root system \( R^\vee \), the same chamber \( C \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i \rangle &gt; 0 \), which is equivalent due to the scaling relationship between roots and coroots.

4. **Verification with Examples**: Checking examples such as \( A_1 \), \( A_2 \), \( B_2 \), and \( G_2 \) confirms that the simple coroots form a base for the dual root system. In each case, the simple coroots correspond to the simple roots of the dual system, ensuring that all positive coroots in \( R^\vee \) are non-negative combinations of the simple coroots.

Thus, the set \( B^\vee \) of simple coroots is indeed a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the set of simple coroots B∨ is always a base for the dual root system R∨. Let me start by recalling some definitions and properties related to root systems, dual root systems, chambers, and bases. 

First, a root system (V, R) consists of a finite set R of non-zero vectors (roots) in a Euclidean space V that satisfy certain axioms, like being closed under reflections and having rational Cartan numbers. The dual root system (V∨, R∨) is formed by taking the coroots α∨ = 2α/(α, α) for each root α in R. 

A chamber C, also known as a Weyl chamber, is a connected component of the complement in V of all the hyperplanes Hα = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0}. Each chamber is an open convex cone, and the group generated by the reflections over the hyperplanes Hα (the Weyl group) acts simply transitively on the chambers. 

For a given chamber C, the corresponding base B = B(C) is the unique set of simple roots {α1, ..., αl} such that C is defined by the intersection of the positive half-spaces determined by the simple roots. That is, C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. The simple roots form a basis of the vector space V and also a basis over the integers for the root lattice. 

Now, the question is whether the set B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} of simple coroots forms a base for the dual root system R∨. To check this, I need to verify if B∨ satisfies the properties of a base when considered in the dual root system. 

A base of a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of the base elements with all coefficients integers of the same sign (either all non-negative or all non-positive). So, for B∨ to be a base of R∨, every coroot β∨ in R∨ should be expressible as a linear combination of the αi∨ with coefficients all non-negative or all non-negative integers. 

First, note that the coroots α∨ are themselves roots in the dual root system R∨. So, B∨ is a subset of R∨. The key point is whether B∨ is a base in the sense of root systems for R∨. 

Given that dual root systems have a duality relationship, I suspect that the simple coroots should form a base for the dual system. However, I need to confirm this carefully. 

Let me recall that in the original root system R, the simple roots B = {α1, ..., αl} form a basis for V and define the positive roots R+ as those roots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple roots. Similarly, the positive coroots R∨+ would be those coroots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple coroots B∨. 

But wait, the coroot of a positive root is not necessarily a positive coroot. Let me check: If β is a positive root in R, then β = Σ niαi with ni ≥ 0. Then β∨ = 2β/(β, β). But how does this relate to the simple coroots? 

Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is that the dual root system R∨ has its own set of simple roots, which may or may not coincide with the simple coroots. 

Alternatively, since the dual of a root system is another root system, with the roles of roots and coroots swapped, perhaps the simple coroots in the original system correspond to the simple roots in the dual system. 

Wait, the coroot system R∨ is a root system in V∨, which is the dual space of V. But if V is equipped with an inner product, we can identify V with V∨, so perhaps they are considered in the same space. Wait, but actually, the coroot α∨ is defined as 2α/(α, α), so if we have a root α in V, then α∨ is in V as well, scaled by 2/(α, α). So the dual root system R∨ is in the same space V, not the dual space. That seems right because the definition of root systems usually includes being in a Euclidean space, and the dual roots are scaled versions. 

Therefore, R∨ is a root system in V, same as R. So the chambers for R∨ would be connected components of V minus the hyperplanes Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, (α∨)∨⟩ = 0}. But (α∨)∨ is equal to α, since the coroot of a coroot is the original root. So Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α⟩ = 0} = Hα. Wait, so the hyperplanes for R∨ are the same as the hyperplanes for R? 

Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s check. For the dual root system R∨, the hyperplanes would be Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β∨∨⟩ = 0}. But β∨ is a root in R∨, so (β∨)∨ = β∨∨ = 2β∨/(β∨, β∨). But β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = 2*(2β/(β, β)) / (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)).

Calculating the inner product in the denominator: (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)) = 4/(β, β)^2 * (β, β) = 4/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = (4β/(β, β)) / (4/(β, β)) ) = β. 

Hence, (β∨)∨ = β. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β⟩ = 0}, which are exactly the same as the hyperplanes Hβ for the original root system R. 

Therefore, the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same. Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of the hyperplanes, are the same for both root systems. 

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. If the hyperplanes are the same, then the chambers are the same. So a chamber C for R is also a chamber for R∨. 

But then, the base B(C) for R is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for each αi in B. Similarly, the base for R∨ corresponding to the same chamber C would be the set of simple roots for R∨, which are the simple coroots? Wait, but the simple roots for R∨ would be the set B∨?

But if the chambers are the same, then the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C should be the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of their positive half-spaces. But in R∨, the positive half-spaces are defined by ⟨x, β∨⟩ &gt; 0 for β∨ in R∨. But since β∨∨ = β, this is equivalent to ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. Wait, but in the original root system, the hyperplanes are defined by ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0. So the positive half-spaces for R∨ would be defined by ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0, where β is a root in R. But these are the same as the positive half-spaces for R, except that in R, the half-spaces are ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let&#x27;s clarify.

In the original root system R, the simple roots α1, ..., αl are such that the chamber C is the set of x in V where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

In the dual root system R∨, the roots are the coroots α∨ for α in R. The chamber for R∨ would be defined in terms of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots in R∨, which are the same hyperplanes as in R. So the chambers for R and R∨ are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the unique set of simple roots β1∨, ..., βl∨ in R∨ such that C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. But since βi∨∨ = βi, this is equivalent to C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. Therefore, in order for B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} to be the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C, we need that C is the set of x where ⟨x, αi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. But since αi∨∨ = αi, this would mean C is the set where ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

However, in the original definition, C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, unless ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is not generally true, these conditions are different. 

Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me check with an example. Let&#x27;s take the root system A1, which is just {α, -α}, with α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If we take the chamber C to be the positive half-line where ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, α⟩ &gt; 0 since α∨ is a positive multiple of α. So in this case, the chamber C is the same whether we use α or α∨. Hence, in this case, the simple coroot α∨ would generate the same chamber as α. 

But wait, in this case, since A1 is self-dual (since α∨ is just a scalar multiple of α), the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, the base for R∨ would just be the same as the base for R. 

But in higher rank root systems, perhaps this is different. Let&#x27;s consider the root system A2, which consists of the roots in the two-dimensional space with simple roots α1 and α2 at 120 degrees. The coroots α1∨ and α2∨ are scaled versions of α1 and α2. Specifically, if α1 and α2 have the same length, then the coroots would be the same roots scaled by 2/(α, α). For example, in the standard normalization where (α, α) = 2, the coroot α∨ is equal to α. But if (α, α) = 1, then α∨ = 2α. 

Wait, in the root system A2, all roots have the same length. Let&#x27;s say the roots are vectors in Euclidean space with length √2, so that (α, α) = 2. Then α∨ = 2α/(α, α) = α. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, in this case, the simple coroots are the same as the simple roots, so B∨ = B, and hence B∨ is a base for R∨, which is R itself. So in this case, yes, B∨ is a base. 

But suppose we have a root system where roots have different lengths, say B2 or G2. Let&#x27;s take B2. In B2, there are long and short roots. Let me recall that in B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The coroots would be α∨ = 2α/(α, α) and β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Since α is long, (α, α) is larger than (β, β). For example, in B2, we can take α = e1 - e2 and β = e2, with (α, α) = 2 and (β, β) = 1. Then α∨ = 2α/2 = α, and β∨ = 2β/1 = 2β. So the coroots in B2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ consists of the roots α and 2β and their negatives, which is actually the root system C2. 

So, in this case, R∨ is of type C2, and the simple coroots for B2 are α and 2β. But in the dual root system C2, the simple roots are different. Wait, the dual root system of B2 is C2, where the simple roots are the coroots of B2. However, in C2, the simple roots are the coroots of B2, so the simple roots for C2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the base B∨ = {α, 2β} is indeed the base for the dual root system C2. 

Wait, but in C2, the simple roots are usually denoted as γ1 and γ2, where γ1 is long and γ2 is short. But in our case, if B2 has simple roots α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ = α and β∨ = 2β, which are the simple roots for C2. Therefore, B∨ is indeed a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in this case, the answer is yes. But let me verify another example. Take G2, which is more complicated. In G2, there are long and short roots, with the ratio of squared lengths being 3. The dual root system of G2 is still G2, since it is self-dual. Wait, but actually, in G2, the roots and coroots have the same length ratio because the ratio of the squares is 3, so when you take coroots, you invert the scaling. Wait, if α is a long root with (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2α/3, and if β is a short root with (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β. So the dual root system would consist of roots 2α/3 and 2β. But is this isomorphic to G2? Wait, G2 is self-dual because the dual of a root system is determined by the inverse of the Cartan matrix, and G2 is simply-laced in some sense? No, G2 is not simply-laced. Wait, maybe it&#x27;s self-dual. Let me recall that in G2, the Cartan matrix is:

[ 2 -3 ]

[-1 2 ]

The inverse of this matrix is:

[2  3]

[1  2] 

divided by determinant, which is 4 - 3 = 1. So the inverse Cartan matrix is the same as the transpose, which would be the Cartan matrix of the dual root system. But since the inverse is not the same as the original, unless we rescale. Wait, but since the Cartan matrix for the dual root system is the transpose of the original Cartan matrix, which for G2 is not symmetric. Wait, but in G2, the Cartan matrix is not symmetric, so its dual root system would have the transpose Cartan matrix, which would correspond to swapping the roots. But in G2, the roots have different lengths, so the dual root system would have the Cartan matrix with entries swapped. However, since G2 is its own dual under the scaling of roots. Let me check if the dual root system is isomorphic to G2.

Wait, if the original roots are long and short, then the coroots would be short and long, respectively. Because α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If α is long, say (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2/3 α, which would be a shorter root. If β is short, (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β, which is longer. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ would have roots that are the coroots of R, which in G2 case are scaled such that the long roots become short and vice versa. But since G2 is self-dual in the sense that the dual root system is isomorphic to the original, just with roots scaled. Therefore, R∨ is isomorphic to R, so the base B∨ would correspond to the base of R∨, which is isomorphic, so yes, B∨ is a base. 

Wait, but if we take the simple roots in G2 as α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ (short) and β∨ (long). Then B∨ would consist of a short root and a long root. In the dual root system R∨, which is isomorphic to G2, the simple roots are these coroots. So, in effect, the base B∨ is a set of simple roots for R∨, which is isomorphic to G2. Therefore, yes, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in all these examples, the set of simple coroots B∨ is indeed a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, perhaps the answer is yes. But I need to ensure there isn&#x27;t some root system where this fails. 

Alternatively, let&#x27;s think abstractly. Since the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same, the chambers are the same. The base for R corresponding to chamber C is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. The base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the set of simple roots δ1, ..., δl in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, δi∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δi∨ = δi (since for R∨, the coroots are the original roots). Wait, no. Wait, in the dual root system R∨, the coroots are (α∨)∨ = α. So if we take R∨, its coroots are the original roots. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = 0} where δ is a root in R∨, i.e., δ = α∨ for some α in R. But δ∨ = (α∨)∨ = α. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = Hα, which are the same as hyperplanes for R. Therefore, as before, chambers are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for those roots. But in R∨, the positive half-space for a root δ ∈ R∨ is defined by ⟨x, δ∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δ ∈ R∨ means δ = β∨ for some β ∈ R. Therefore, ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = ⟨x, (β∨)∨⟩ = ⟨x, β⟩. Therefore, the positive half-space for δ = β∨ is ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all simple roots αi. So if we want the base for R∨, we need the simple roots δj in R∨ such that ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 defines C. But δj∨ = βj, so this becomes ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original system, the chamber C is also defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, if the set of βj is such that ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, then βj must be related to αi∨. 

Wait, this seems a bit circular. Let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have the chamber C. For the original root system R, the simple roots αi are the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. For the dual root system R∨, the simple roots δj must be the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δj∨ is in R, since δj is in R∨. So δj∨ = αj. Therefore, the condition ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, for the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. But in the original system, C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Therefore, unless ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 and ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 define the same chamber, which is only the case if αj and αj∨ are scalar multiples. But αj∨ = 2αj/(αj, αj). Therefore, αj∨ is a scalar multiple of αj. Hence, the half-space ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is the same as ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 if and only if the scalar is positive, which it is. Since 2/(αj, αj) is positive, then yes, ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the chamber C is defined equivalently by either ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 or ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, in the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the set of simple roots for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the set of δj such that δj∨ = αj, which implies δj = αj∨. Therefore, the simple roots for R∨ are exactly the simple coroots B∨. 

Therefore, this shows that the set B∨ is indeed the base for the dual root system R∨ corresponding to the chamber C. 

Thus, in general, the simple coroots B∨ form a base for the dual root system R∨. 

But let me verify once again. Suppose that in the dual root system R∨, the simple roots are the simple coroots of R. Then the positive coroots in R∨ would be the non-negative linear combinations of the simple coroots. But in R∨, the roots are the coroots of R, so the positive coroots would correspond to the positive roots in R∨. But a positive root in R∨ is a coroot that is a non-negative combination of the simple coroots. However, in the original system, the positive roots are non-negative combinations of the simple roots. There&#x27;s a duality here. 

For example, in the original root system, a positive root is a sum of simple roots with non-negative coefficients. The coroot of a positive root is a positive coroot, but the positive coroots are not necessarily the same as the non-negative combinations of simple coroots. Wait, but if B∨ is a base for R∨, then every positive coroot in R∨ is a non-negative combination of B∨. Let me check with B2 example. 

In B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The positive roots are α, β, α + β, α + 2β. The coroots would be α∨ = α, β∨ = 2β. The positive coroots are α, 2β, α + 2β, 2α + 4β. Wait, no. Wait, the coroots of the roots are:

For α: α∨ = α.

For β: β∨ = 2β.

For α + β: (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/(α + β, α + β). Let&#x27;s compute (α + β, α + β) = (α, α) + 2(α, β) + (β, β). In B2, (α, α) = 2, (β, β) = 1, and (α, β) = -1. Therefore, (α + β, α + β) = 2 + 2*(-1) + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Therefore, (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/1 = 2α + 2β.

Similarly, for α + 2β: (α + 2β, α + 2β) = (α, α) + 4(α, β) + 4(β, β) = 2 + 4*(-1) + 4*1 = 2 -4 +4 = 2. Therefore, (α + 2β)∨ = 2(α + 2β)/2 = α + 2β.

Therefore, the positive coroots in R∨ are α, 2β, 2α + 2β, and α + 2β. 

Now, the simple coroots B∨ = {α∨, β∨} = {α, 2β}. The positive coroots in R∨ should be the non-negative combinations of α and 2β. Let&#x27;s see:

- α is a non-negative combination of α and 2β (1*α + 0*2β).
- 2β is 0*α + 1*2β.
- 2α + 2β is 2*α + 1*2β.
- α + 2β is 1*α + 1*2β.

Therefore, all positive coroots in R∨ are indeed non-negative combinations of the simple coroots B∨. Therefore, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Similarly, if we take a positive coroot like 2α + 2β, which is not a coroot of a simple root, but it is a combination of the simple coroots. Therefore, B∨ satisfies the conditions of a base. 

Hence, through these examples and abstract reasoning, it seems that the simple coroots B∨ indeed form a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the set of simple coroots \( B^\vee = \{\alpha_1^\vee, \ldots, \alpha_l^\vee\} \) forms a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \), we need to verify if \( B^\vee \) satisfies the properties of a base in the dual root system. 

1. **Hyperplanes and Chambers**: The hyperplanes for the dual root system \( R^\vee \) are the same as those for the original root system \( R \). This is because the coroot of a coroot \( (\alpha^\vee)^\vee \) is the original root \( \alpha \). Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of these hyperplanes, are the same for both \( R \) and \( R^\vee \).

2. **Base Definition**: A base for a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of these simple roots with all coefficients integers of the same sign. For \( B^\vee \) to be a base for \( R^\vee \), every coroot \( \beta^\vee \in R^\vee \) must be expressible as a non-negative or non-positive integer combination of the simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \).

3. **Duality Relationship**: The dual root system \( R^\vee \) consists of coroots \( \alpha^\vee \) for each root \( \alpha \in R \). The simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \) are scaled versions of the simple roots \( \alpha_i \). For a chamber \( C \), the base \( B \) of \( R \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i^\vee \rangle &gt; 0 \). For the dual root system \( R^\vee \), the same chamber \( C \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i \rangle &gt; 0 \), which is equivalent due to the scaling relationship between roots and coroots.

4. **Verification with Examples**: Checking examples such as \( A_1 \), \( A_2 \), \( B_2 \), and \( G_2 \) confirms that the simple coroots form a base for the dual root system. In each case, the simple coroots correspond to the simple roots of the dual system, ensuring that all positive coroots in \( R^\vee \) are non-negative combinations of the simple coroots.

Thus, the set \( B^\vee \) of simple coroots is indeed a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the set of simple coroots B∨ is always a base for the dual root system R∨. Let me start by recalling some definitions and properties related to root systems, dual root systems, chambers, and bases. 

First, a root system (V, R) consists of a finite set R of non-zero vectors (roots) in a Euclidean space V that satisfy certain axioms, like being closed under reflections and having rational Cartan numbers. The dual root system (V∨, R∨) is formed by taking the coroots α∨ = 2α/(α, α) for each root α in R. 

A chamber C, also known as a Weyl chamber, is a connected component of the complement in V of all the hyperplanes Hα = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0}. Each chamber is an open convex cone, and the group generated by the reflections over the hyperplanes Hα (the Weyl group) acts simply transitively on the chambers. 

For a given chamber C, the corresponding base B = B(C) is the unique set of simple roots {α1, ..., αl} such that C is defined by the intersection of the positive half-spaces determined by the simple roots. That is, C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. The simple roots form a basis of the vector space V and also a basis over the integers for the root lattice. 

Now, the question is whether the set B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} of simple coroots forms a base for the dual root system R∨. To check this, I need to verify if B∨ satisfies the properties of a base when considered in the dual root system. 

A base of a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of the base elements with all coefficients integers of the same sign (either all non-negative or all non-positive). So, for B∨ to be a base of R∨, every coroot β∨ in R∨ should be expressible as a linear combination of the αi∨ with coefficients all non-negative or all non-negative integers. 

First, note that the coroots α∨ are themselves roots in the dual root system R∨. So, B∨ is a subset of R∨. The key point is whether B∨ is a base in the sense of root systems for R∨. 

Given that dual root systems have a duality relationship, I suspect that the simple coroots should form a base for the dual system. However, I need to confirm this carefully. 

Let me recall that in the original root system R, the simple roots B = {α1, ..., αl} form a basis for V and define the positive roots R+ as those roots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple roots. Similarly, the positive coroots R∨+ would be those coroots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple coroots B∨. 

But wait, the coroot of a positive root is not necessarily a positive coroot. Let me check: If β is a positive root in R, then β = Σ niαi with ni ≥ 0. Then β∨ = 2β/(β, β). But how does this relate to the simple coroots? 

Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is that the dual root system R∨ has its own set of simple roots, which may or may not coincide with the simple coroots. 

Alternatively, since the dual of a root system is another root system, with the roles of roots and coroots swapped, perhaps the simple coroots in the original system correspond to the simple roots in the dual system. 

Wait, the coroot system R∨ is a root system in V∨, which is the dual space of V. But if V is equipped with an inner product, we can identify V with V∨, so perhaps they are considered in the same space. Wait, but actually, the coroot α∨ is defined as 2α/(α, α), so if we have a root α in V, then α∨ is in V as well, scaled by 2/(α, α). So the dual root system R∨ is in the same space V, not the dual space. That seems right because the definition of root systems usually includes being in a Euclidean space, and the dual roots are scaled versions. 

Therefore, R∨ is a root system in V, same as R. So the chambers for R∨ would be connected components of V minus the hyperplanes Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, (α∨)∨⟩ = 0}. But (α∨)∨ is equal to α, since the coroot of a coroot is the original root. So Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α⟩ = 0} = Hα. Wait, so the hyperplanes for R∨ are the same as the hyperplanes for R? 

Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s check. For the dual root system R∨, the hyperplanes would be Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β∨∨⟩ = 0}. But β∨ is a root in R∨, so (β∨)∨ = β∨∨ = 2β∨/(β∨, β∨). But β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = 2*(2β/(β, β)) / (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)).

Calculating the inner product in the denominator: (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)) = 4/(β, β)^2 * (β, β) = 4/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = (4β/(β, β)) / (4/(β, β)) ) = β. 

Hence, (β∨)∨ = β. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β⟩ = 0}, which are exactly the same as the hyperplanes Hβ for the original root system R. 

Therefore, the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same. Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of the hyperplanes, are the same for both root systems. 

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. If the hyperplanes are the same, then the chambers are the same. So a chamber C for R is also a chamber for R∨. 

But then, the base B(C) for R is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for each αi in B. Similarly, the base for R∨ corresponding to the same chamber C would be the set of simple roots for R∨, which are the simple coroots? Wait, but the simple roots for R∨ would be the set B∨?

But if the chambers are the same, then the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C should be the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of their positive half-spaces. But in R∨, the positive half-spaces are defined by ⟨x, β∨⟩ &gt; 0 for β∨ in R∨. But since β∨∨ = β, this is equivalent to ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. Wait, but in the original root system, the hyperplanes are defined by ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0. So the positive half-spaces for R∨ would be defined by ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0, where β is a root in R. But these are the same as the positive half-spaces for R, except that in R, the half-spaces are ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let&#x27;s clarify.

In the original root system R, the simple roots α1, ..., αl are such that the chamber C is the set of x in V where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

In the dual root system R∨, the roots are the coroots α∨ for α in R. The chamber for R∨ would be defined in terms of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots in R∨, which are the same hyperplanes as in R. So the chambers for R and R∨ are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the unique set of simple roots β1∨, ..., βl∨ in R∨ such that C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. But since βi∨∨ = βi, this is equivalent to C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. Therefore, in order for B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} to be the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C, we need that C is the set of x where ⟨x, αi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. But since αi∨∨ = αi, this would mean C is the set where ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

However, in the original definition, C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, unless ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is not generally true, these conditions are different. 

Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me check with an example. Let&#x27;s take the root system A1, which is just {α, -α}, with α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If we take the chamber C to be the positive half-line where ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, α⟩ &gt; 0 since α∨ is a positive multiple of α. So in this case, the chamber C is the same whether we use α or α∨. Hence, in this case, the simple coroot α∨ would generate the same chamber as α. 

But wait, in this case, since A1 is self-dual (since α∨ is just a scalar multiple of α), the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, the base for R∨ would just be the same as the base for R. 

But in higher rank root systems, perhaps this is different. Let&#x27;s consider the root system A2, which consists of the roots in the two-dimensional space with simple roots α1 and α2 at 120 degrees. The coroots α1∨ and α2∨ are scaled versions of α1 and α2. Specifically, if α1 and α2 have the same length, then the coroots would be the same roots scaled by 2/(α, α). For example, in the standard normalization where (α, α) = 2, the coroot α∨ is equal to α. But if (α, α) = 1, then α∨ = 2α. 

Wait, in the root system A2, all roots have the same length. Let&#x27;s say the roots are vectors in Euclidean space with length √2, so that (α, α) = 2. Then α∨ = 2α/(α, α) = α. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, in this case, the simple coroots are the same as the simple roots, so B∨ = B, and hence B∨ is a base for R∨, which is R itself. So in this case, yes, B∨ is a base. 

But suppose we have a root system where roots have different lengths, say B2 or G2. Let&#x27;s take B2. In B2, there are long and short roots. Let me recall that in B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The coroots would be α∨ = 2α/(α, α) and β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Since α is long, (α, α) is larger than (β, β). For example, in B2, we can take α = e1 - e2 and β = e2, with (α, α) = 2 and (β, β) = 1. Then α∨ = 2α/2 = α, and β∨ = 2β/1 = 2β. So the coroots in B2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ consists of the roots α and 2β and their negatives, which is actually the root system C2. 

So, in this case, R∨ is of type C2, and the simple coroots for B2 are α and 2β. But in the dual root system C2, the simple roots are different. Wait, the dual root system of B2 is C2, where the simple roots are the coroots of B2. However, in C2, the simple roots are the coroots of B2, so the simple roots for C2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the base B∨ = {α, 2β} is indeed the base for the dual root system C2. 

Wait, but in C2, the simple roots are usually denoted as γ1 and γ2, where γ1 is long and γ2 is short. But in our case, if B2 has simple roots α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ = α and β∨ = 2β, which are the simple roots for C2. Therefore, B∨ is indeed a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in this case, the answer is yes. But let me verify another example. Take G2, which is more complicated. In G2, there are long and short roots, with the ratio of squared lengths being 3. The dual root system of G2 is still G2, since it is self-dual. Wait, but actually, in G2, the roots and coroots have the same length ratio because the ratio of the squares is 3, so when you take coroots, you invert the scaling. Wait, if α is a long root with (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2α/3, and if β is a short root with (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β. So the dual root system would consist of roots 2α/3 and 2β. But is this isomorphic to G2? Wait, G2 is self-dual because the dual of a root system is determined by the inverse of the Cartan matrix, and G2 is simply-laced in some sense? No, G2 is not simply-laced. Wait, maybe it&#x27;s self-dual. Let me recall that in G2, the Cartan matrix is:

[ 2 -3 ]

[-1 2 ]

The inverse of this matrix is:

[2  3]

[1  2] 

divided by determinant, which is 4 - 3 = 1. So the inverse Cartan matrix is the same as the transpose, which would be the Cartan matrix of the dual root system. But since the inverse is not the same as the original, unless we rescale. Wait, but since the Cartan matrix for the dual root system is the transpose of the original Cartan matrix, which for G2 is not symmetric. Wait, but in G2, the Cartan matrix is not symmetric, so its dual root system would have the transpose Cartan matrix, which would correspond to swapping the roots. But in G2, the roots have different lengths, so the dual root system would have the Cartan matrix with entries swapped. However, since G2 is its own dual under the scaling of roots. Let me check if the dual root system is isomorphic to G2.

Wait, if the original roots are long and short, then the coroots would be short and long, respectively. Because α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If α is long, say (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2/3 α, which would be a shorter root. If β is short, (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β, which is longer. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ would have roots that are the coroots of R, which in G2 case are scaled such that the long roots become short and vice versa. But since G2 is self-dual in the sense that the dual root system is isomorphic to the original, just with roots scaled. Therefore, R∨ is isomorphic to R, so the base B∨ would correspond to the base of R∨, which is isomorphic, so yes, B∨ is a base. 

Wait, but if we take the simple roots in G2 as α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ (short) and β∨ (long). Then B∨ would consist of a short root and a long root. In the dual root system R∨, which is isomorphic to G2, the simple roots are these coroots. So, in effect, the base B∨ is a set of simple roots for R∨, which is isomorphic to G2. Therefore, yes, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in all these examples, the set of simple coroots B∨ is indeed a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, perhaps the answer is yes. But I need to ensure there isn&#x27;t some root system where this fails. 

Alternatively, let&#x27;s think abstractly. Since the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same, the chambers are the same. The base for R corresponding to chamber C is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. The base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the set of simple roots δ1, ..., δl in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, δi∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δi∨ = δi (since for R∨, the coroots are the original roots). Wait, no. Wait, in the dual root system R∨, the coroots are (α∨)∨ = α. So if we take R∨, its coroots are the original roots. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = 0} where δ is a root in R∨, i.e., δ = α∨ for some α in R. But δ∨ = (α∨)∨ = α. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = Hα, which are the same as hyperplanes for R. Therefore, as before, chambers are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for those roots. But in R∨, the positive half-space for a root δ ∈ R∨ is defined by ⟨x, δ∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δ ∈ R∨ means δ = β∨ for some β ∈ R. Therefore, ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = ⟨x, (β∨)∨⟩ = ⟨x, β⟩. Therefore, the positive half-space for δ = β∨ is ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all simple roots αi. So if we want the base for R∨, we need the simple roots δj in R∨ such that ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 defines C. But δj∨ = βj, so this becomes ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original system, the chamber C is also defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, if the set of βj is such that ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, then βj must be related to αi∨. 

Wait, this seems a bit circular. Let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have the chamber C. For the original root system R, the simple roots αi are the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. For the dual root system R∨, the simple roots δj must be the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δj∨ is in R, since δj is in R∨. So δj∨ = αj. Therefore, the condition ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, for the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. But in the original system, C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Therefore, unless ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 and ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 define the same chamber, which is only the case if αj and αj∨ are scalar multiples. But αj∨ = 2αj/(αj, αj). Therefore, αj∨ is a scalar multiple of αj. Hence, the half-space ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is the same as ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 if and only if the scalar is positive, which it is. Since 2/(αj, αj) is positive, then yes, ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the chamber C is defined equivalently by either ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 or ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, in the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the set of simple roots for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the set of δj such that δj∨ = αj, which implies δj = αj∨. Therefore, the simple roots for R∨ are exactly the simple coroots B∨. 

Therefore, this shows that the set B∨ is indeed the base for the dual root system R∨ corresponding to the chamber C. 

Thus, in general, the simple coroots B∨ form a base for the dual root system R∨. 

But let me verify once again. Suppose that in the dual root system R∨, the simple roots are the simple coroots of R. Then the positive coroots in R∨ would be the non-negative linear combinations of the simple coroots. But in R∨, the roots are the coroots of R, so the positive coroots would correspond to the positive roots in R∨. But a positive root in R∨ is a coroot that is a non-negative combination of the simple coroots. However, in the original system, the positive roots are non-negative combinations of the simple roots. There&#x27;s a duality here. 

For example, in the original root system, a positive root is a sum of simple roots with non-negative coefficients. The coroot of a positive root is a positive coroot, but the positive coroots are not necessarily the same as the non-negative combinations of simple coroots. Wait, but if B∨ is a base for R∨, then every positive coroot in R∨ is a non-negative combination of B∨. Let me check with B2 example. 

In B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The positive roots are α, β, α + β, α + 2β. The coroots would be α∨ = α, β∨ = 2β. The positive coroots are α, 2β, α + 2β, 2α + 4β. Wait, no. Wait, the coroots of the roots are:

For α: α∨ = α.

For β: β∨ = 2β.

For α + β: (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/(α + β, α + β). Let&#x27;s compute (α + β, α + β) = (α, α) + 2(α, β) + (β, β). In B2, (α, α) = 2, (β, β) = 1, and (α, β) = -1. Therefore, (α + β, α + β) = 2 + 2*(-1) + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Therefore, (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/1 = 2α + 2β.

Similarly, for α + 2β: (α + 2β, α + 2β) = (α, α) + 4(α, β) + 4(β, β) = 2 + 4*(-1) + 4*1 = 2 -4 +4 = 2. Therefore, (α + 2β)∨ = 2(α + 2β)/2 = α + 2β.

Therefore, the positive coroots in R∨ are α, 2β, 2α + 2β, and α + 2β. 

Now, the simple coroots B∨ = {α∨, β∨} = {α, 2β}. The positive coroots in R∨ should be the non-negative combinations of α and 2β. Let&#x27;s see:

- α is a non-negative combination of α and 2β (1*α + 0*2β).
- 2β is 0*α + 1*2β.
- 2α + 2β is 2*α + 1*2β.
- α + 2β is 1*α + 1*2β.

Therefore, all positive coroots in R∨ are indeed non-negative combinations of the simple coroots B∨. Therefore, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Similarly, if we take a positive coroot like 2α + 2β, which is not a coroot of a simple root, but it is a combination of the simple coroots. Therefore, B∨ satisfies the conditions of a base. 

Hence, through these examples and abstract reasoning, it seems that the simple coroots B∨ indeed form a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the set of simple coroots \( B^\vee = \{\alpha_1^\vee, \ldots, \alpha_l^\vee\} \) forms a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \), we need to verify if \( B^\vee \) satisfies the properties of a base in the dual root system. 

1. **Hyperplanes and Chambers**: The hyperplanes for the dual root system \( R^\vee \) are the same as those for the original root system \( R \). This is because the coroot of a coroot \( (\alpha^\vee)^\vee \) is the original root \( \alpha \). Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of these hyperplanes, are the same for both \( R \) and \( R^\vee \).

2. **Base Definition**: A base for a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of these simple roots with all coefficients integers of the same sign. For \( B^\vee \) to be a base for \( R^\vee \), every coroot \( \beta^\vee \in R^\vee \) must be expressible as a non-negative or non-positive integer combination of the simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \).

3. **Duality Relationship**: The dual root system \( R^\vee \) consists of coroots \( \alpha^\vee \) for each root \( \alpha \in R \). The simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \) are scaled versions of the simple roots \( \alpha_i \). For a chamber \( C \), the base \( B \) of \( R \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i^\vee \rangle &gt; 0 \). For the dual root system \( R^\vee \), the same chamber \( C \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i \rangle &gt; 0 \), which is equivalent due to the scaling relationship between roots and coroots.

4. **Verification with Examples**: Checking examples such as \( A_1 \), \( A_2 \), \( B_2 \), and \( G_2 \) confirms that the simple coroots form a base for the dual root system. In each case, the simple coroots correspond to the simple roots of the dual system, ensuring that all positive coroots in \( R^\vee \) are non-negative combinations of the simple coroots.

Thus, the set \( B^\vee \) of simple coroots is indeed a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the set of simple coroots B∨ is always a base for the dual root system R∨. Let me start by recalling some definitions and properties related to root systems, dual root systems, chambers, and bases. 

First, a root system (V, R) consists of a finite set R of non-zero vectors (roots) in a Euclidean space V that satisfy certain axioms, like being closed under reflections and having rational Cartan numbers. The dual root system (V∨, R∨) is formed by taking the coroots α∨ = 2α/(α, α) for each root α in R. 

A chamber C, also known as a Weyl chamber, is a connected component of the complement in V of all the hyperplanes Hα = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0}. Each chamber is an open convex cone, and the group generated by the reflections over the hyperplanes Hα (the Weyl group) acts simply transitively on the chambers. 

For a given chamber C, the corresponding base B = B(C) is the unique set of simple roots {α1, ..., αl} such that C is defined by the intersection of the positive half-spaces determined by the simple roots. That is, C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. The simple roots form a basis of the vector space V and also a basis over the integers for the root lattice. 

Now, the question is whether the set B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} of simple coroots forms a base for the dual root system R∨. To check this, I need to verify if B∨ satisfies the properties of a base when considered in the dual root system. 

A base of a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of the base elements with all coefficients integers of the same sign (either all non-negative or all non-positive). So, for B∨ to be a base of R∨, every coroot β∨ in R∨ should be expressible as a linear combination of the αi∨ with coefficients all non-negative or all non-negative integers. 

First, note that the coroots α∨ are themselves roots in the dual root system R∨. So, B∨ is a subset of R∨. The key point is whether B∨ is a base in the sense of root systems for R∨. 

Given that dual root systems have a duality relationship, I suspect that the simple coroots should form a base for the dual system. However, I need to confirm this carefully. 

Let me recall that in the original root system R, the simple roots B = {α1, ..., αl} form a basis for V and define the positive roots R+ as those roots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple roots. Similarly, the positive coroots R∨+ would be those coroots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple coroots B∨. 

But wait, the coroot of a positive root is not necessarily a positive coroot. Let me check: If β is a positive root in R, then β = Σ niαi with ni ≥ 0. Then β∨ = 2β/(β, β). But how does this relate to the simple coroots? 

Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is that the dual root system R∨ has its own set of simple roots, which may or may not coincide with the simple coroots. 

Alternatively, since the dual of a root system is another root system, with the roles of roots and coroots swapped, perhaps the simple coroots in the original system correspond to the simple roots in the dual system. 

Wait, the coroot system R∨ is a root system in V∨, which is the dual space of V. But if V is equipped with an inner product, we can identify V with V∨, so perhaps they are considered in the same space. Wait, but actually, the coroot α∨ is defined as 2α/(α, α), so if we have a root α in V, then α∨ is in V as well, scaled by 2/(α, α). So the dual root system R∨ is in the same space V, not the dual space. That seems right because the definition of root systems usually includes being in a Euclidean space, and the dual roots are scaled versions. 

Therefore, R∨ is a root system in V, same as R. So the chambers for R∨ would be connected components of V minus the hyperplanes Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, (α∨)∨⟩ = 0}. But (α∨)∨ is equal to α, since the coroot of a coroot is the original root. So Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α⟩ = 0} = Hα. Wait, so the hyperplanes for R∨ are the same as the hyperplanes for R? 

Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s check. For the dual root system R∨, the hyperplanes would be Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β∨∨⟩ = 0}. But β∨ is a root in R∨, so (β∨)∨ = β∨∨ = 2β∨/(β∨, β∨). But β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = 2*(2β/(β, β)) / (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)).

Calculating the inner product in the denominator: (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)) = 4/(β, β)^2 * (β, β) = 4/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = (4β/(β, β)) / (4/(β, β)) ) = β. 

Hence, (β∨)∨ = β. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β⟩ = 0}, which are exactly the same as the hyperplanes Hβ for the original root system R. 

Therefore, the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same. Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of the hyperplanes, are the same for both root systems. 

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. If the hyperplanes are the same, then the chambers are the same. So a chamber C for R is also a chamber for R∨. 

But then, the base B(C) for R is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for each αi in B. Similarly, the base for R∨ corresponding to the same chamber C would be the set of simple roots for R∨, which are the simple coroots? Wait, but the simple roots for R∨ would be the set B∨?

But if the chambers are the same, then the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C should be the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of their positive half-spaces. But in R∨, the positive half-spaces are defined by ⟨x, β∨⟩ &gt; 0 for β∨ in R∨. But since β∨∨ = β, this is equivalent to ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. Wait, but in the original root system, the hyperplanes are defined by ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0. So the positive half-spaces for R∨ would be defined by ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0, where β is a root in R. But these are the same as the positive half-spaces for R, except that in R, the half-spaces are ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let&#x27;s clarify.

In the original root system R, the simple roots α1, ..., αl are such that the chamber C is the set of x in V where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

In the dual root system R∨, the roots are the coroots α∨ for α in R. The chamber for R∨ would be defined in terms of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots in R∨, which are the same hyperplanes as in R. So the chambers for R and R∨ are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the unique set of simple roots β1∨, ..., βl∨ in R∨ such that C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. But since βi∨∨ = βi, this is equivalent to C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. Therefore, in order for B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} to be the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C, we need that C is the set of x where ⟨x, αi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. But since αi∨∨ = αi, this would mean C is the set where ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

However, in the original definition, C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, unless ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is not generally true, these conditions are different. 

Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me check with an example. Let&#x27;s take the root system A1, which is just {α, -α}, with α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If we take the chamber C to be the positive half-line where ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, α⟩ &gt; 0 since α∨ is a positive multiple of α. So in this case, the chamber C is the same whether we use α or α∨. Hence, in this case, the simple coroot α∨ would generate the same chamber as α. 

But wait, in this case, since A1 is self-dual (since α∨ is just a scalar multiple of α), the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, the base for R∨ would just be the same as the base for R. 

But in higher rank root systems, perhaps this is different. Let&#x27;s consider the root system A2, which consists of the roots in the two-dimensional space with simple roots α1 and α2 at 120 degrees. The coroots α1∨ and α2∨ are scaled versions of α1 and α2. Specifically, if α1 and α2 have the same length, then the coroots would be the same roots scaled by 2/(α, α). For example, in the standard normalization where (α, α) = 2, the coroot α∨ is equal to α. But if (α, α) = 1, then α∨ = 2α. 

Wait, in the root system A2, all roots have the same length. Let&#x27;s say the roots are vectors in Euclidean space with length √2, so that (α, α) = 2. Then α∨ = 2α/(α, α) = α. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, in this case, the simple coroots are the same as the simple roots, so B∨ = B, and hence B∨ is a base for R∨, which is R itself. So in this case, yes, B∨ is a base. 

But suppose we have a root system where roots have different lengths, say B2 or G2. Let&#x27;s take B2. In B2, there are long and short roots. Let me recall that in B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The coroots would be α∨ = 2α/(α, α) and β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Since α is long, (α, α) is larger than (β, β). For example, in B2, we can take α = e1 - e2 and β = e2, with (α, α) = 2 and (β, β) = 1. Then α∨ = 2α/2 = α, and β∨ = 2β/1 = 2β. So the coroots in B2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ consists of the roots α and 2β and their negatives, which is actually the root system C2. 

So, in this case, R∨ is of type C2, and the simple coroots for B2 are α and 2β. But in the dual root system C2, the simple roots are different. Wait, the dual root system of B2 is C2, where the simple roots are the coroots of B2. However, in C2, the simple roots are the coroots of B2, so the simple roots for C2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the base B∨ = {α, 2β} is indeed the base for the dual root system C2. 

Wait, but in C2, the simple roots are usually denoted as γ1 and γ2, where γ1 is long and γ2 is short. But in our case, if B2 has simple roots α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ = α and β∨ = 2β, which are the simple roots for C2. Therefore, B∨ is indeed a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in this case, the answer is yes. But let me verify another example. Take G2, which is more complicated. In G2, there are long and short roots, with the ratio of squared lengths being 3. The dual root system of G2 is still G2, since it is self-dual. Wait, but actually, in G2, the roots and coroots have the same length ratio because the ratio of the squares is 3, so when you take coroots, you invert the scaling. Wait, if α is a long root with (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2α/3, and if β is a short root with (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β. So the dual root system would consist of roots 2α/3 and 2β. But is this isomorphic to G2? Wait, G2 is self-dual because the dual of a root system is determined by the inverse of the Cartan matrix, and G2 is simply-laced in some sense? No, G2 is not simply-laced. Wait, maybe it&#x27;s self-dual. Let me recall that in G2, the Cartan matrix is:

[ 2 -3 ]

[-1 2 ]

The inverse of this matrix is:

[2  3]

[1  2] 

divided by determinant, which is 4 - 3 = 1. So the inverse Cartan matrix is the same as the transpose, which would be the Cartan matrix of the dual root system. But since the inverse is not the same as the original, unless we rescale. Wait, but since the Cartan matrix for the dual root system is the transpose of the original Cartan matrix, which for G2 is not symmetric. Wait, but in G2, the Cartan matrix is not symmetric, so its dual root system would have the transpose Cartan matrix, which would correspond to swapping the roots. But in G2, the roots have different lengths, so the dual root system would have the Cartan matrix with entries swapped. However, since G2 is its own dual under the scaling of roots. Let me check if the dual root system is isomorphic to G2.

Wait, if the original roots are long and short, then the coroots would be short and long, respectively. Because α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If α is long, say (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2/3 α, which would be a shorter root. If β is short, (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β, which is longer. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ would have roots that are the coroots of R, which in G2 case are scaled such that the long roots become short and vice versa. But since G2 is self-dual in the sense that the dual root system is isomorphic to the original, just with roots scaled. Therefore, R∨ is isomorphic to R, so the base B∨ would correspond to the base of R∨, which is isomorphic, so yes, B∨ is a base. 

Wait, but if we take the simple roots in G2 as α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ (short) and β∨ (long). Then B∨ would consist of a short root and a long root. In the dual root system R∨, which is isomorphic to G2, the simple roots are these coroots. So, in effect, the base B∨ is a set of simple roots for R∨, which is isomorphic to G2. Therefore, yes, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in all these examples, the set of simple coroots B∨ is indeed a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, perhaps the answer is yes. But I need to ensure there isn&#x27;t some root system where this fails. 

Alternatively, let&#x27;s think abstractly. Since the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same, the chambers are the same. The base for R corresponding to chamber C is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. The base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the set of simple roots δ1, ..., δl in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, δi∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δi∨ = δi (since for R∨, the coroots are the original roots). Wait, no. Wait, in the dual root system R∨, the coroots are (α∨)∨ = α. So if we take R∨, its coroots are the original roots. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = 0} where δ is a root in R∨, i.e., δ = α∨ for some α in R. But δ∨ = (α∨)∨ = α. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = Hα, which are the same as hyperplanes for R. Therefore, as before, chambers are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for those roots. But in R∨, the positive half-space for a root δ ∈ R∨ is defined by ⟨x, δ∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δ ∈ R∨ means δ = β∨ for some β ∈ R. Therefore, ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = ⟨x, (β∨)∨⟩ = ⟨x, β⟩. Therefore, the positive half-space for δ = β∨ is ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all simple roots αi. So if we want the base for R∨, we need the simple roots δj in R∨ such that ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 defines C. But δj∨ = βj, so this becomes ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original system, the chamber C is also defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, if the set of βj is such that ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, then βj must be related to αi∨. 

Wait, this seems a bit circular. Let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have the chamber C. For the original root system R, the simple roots αi are the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. For the dual root system R∨, the simple roots δj must be the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δj∨ is in R, since δj is in R∨. So δj∨ = αj. Therefore, the condition ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, for the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. But in the original system, C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Therefore, unless ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 and ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 define the same chamber, which is only the case if αj and αj∨ are scalar multiples. But αj∨ = 2αj/(αj, αj). Therefore, αj∨ is a scalar multiple of αj. Hence, the half-space ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is the same as ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 if and only if the scalar is positive, which it is. Since 2/(αj, αj) is positive, then yes, ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the chamber C is defined equivalently by either ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 or ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, in the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the set of simple roots for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the set of δj such that δj∨ = αj, which implies δj = αj∨. Therefore, the simple roots for R∨ are exactly the simple coroots B∨. 

Therefore, this shows that the set B∨ is indeed the base for the dual root system R∨ corresponding to the chamber C. 

Thus, in general, the simple coroots B∨ form a base for the dual root system R∨. 

But let me verify once again. Suppose that in the dual root system R∨, the simple roots are the simple coroots of R. Then the positive coroots in R∨ would be the non-negative linear combinations of the simple coroots. But in R∨, the roots are the coroots of R, so the positive coroots would correspond to the positive roots in R∨. But a positive root in R∨ is a coroot that is a non-negative combination of the simple coroots. However, in the original system, the positive roots are non-negative combinations of the simple roots. There&#x27;s a duality here. 

For example, in the original root system, a positive root is a sum of simple roots with non-negative coefficients. The coroot of a positive root is a positive coroot, but the positive coroots are not necessarily the same as the non-negative combinations of simple coroots. Wait, but if B∨ is a base for R∨, then every positive coroot in R∨ is a non-negative combination of B∨. Let me check with B2 example. 

In B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The positive roots are α, β, α + β, α + 2β. The coroots would be α∨ = α, β∨ = 2β. The positive coroots are α, 2β, α + 2β, 2α + 4β. Wait, no. Wait, the coroots of the roots are:

For α: α∨ = α.

For β: β∨ = 2β.

For α + β: (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/(α + β, α + β). Let&#x27;s compute (α + β, α + β) = (α, α) + 2(α, β) + (β, β). In B2, (α, α) = 2, (β, β) = 1, and (α, β) = -1. Therefore, (α + β, α + β) = 2 + 2*(-1) + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Therefore, (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/1 = 2α + 2β.

Similarly, for α + 2β: (α + 2β, α + 2β) = (α, α) + 4(α, β) + 4(β, β) = 2 + 4*(-1) + 4*1 = 2 -4 +4 = 2. Therefore, (α + 2β)∨ = 2(α + 2β)/2 = α + 2β.

Therefore, the positive coroots in R∨ are α, 2β, 2α + 2β, and α + 2β. 

Now, the simple coroots B∨ = {α∨, β∨} = {α, 2β}. The positive coroots in R∨ should be the non-negative combinations of α and 2β. Let&#x27;s see:

- α is a non-negative combination of α and 2β (1*α + 0*2β).
- 2β is 0*α + 1*2β.
- 2α + 2β is 2*α + 1*2β.
- α + 2β is 1*α + 1*2β.

Therefore, all positive coroots in R∨ are indeed non-negative combinations of the simple coroots B∨. Therefore, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Similarly, if we take a positive coroot like 2α + 2β, which is not a coroot of a simple root, but it is a combination of the simple coroots. Therefore, B∨ satisfies the conditions of a base. 

Hence, through these examples and abstract reasoning, it seems that the simple coroots B∨ indeed form a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the set of simple coroots \( B^\vee = \{\alpha_1^\vee, \ldots, \alpha_l^\vee\} \) forms a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \), we need to verify if \( B^\vee \) satisfies the properties of a base in the dual root system. 

1. **Hyperplanes and Chambers**: The hyperplanes for the dual root system \( R^\vee \) are the same as those for the original root system \( R \). This is because the coroot of a coroot \( (\alpha^\vee)^\vee \) is the original root \( \alpha \). Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of these hyperplanes, are the same for both \( R \) and \( R^\vee \).

2. **Base Definition**: A base for a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of these simple roots with all coefficients integers of the same sign. For \( B^\vee \) to be a base for \( R^\vee \), every coroot \( \beta^\vee \in R^\vee \) must be expressible as a non-negative or non-positive integer combination of the simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \).

3. **Duality Relationship**: The dual root system \( R^\vee \) consists of coroots \( \alpha^\vee \) for each root \( \alpha \in R \). The simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \) are scaled versions of the simple roots \( \alpha_i \). For a chamber \( C \), the base \( B \) of \( R \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i^\vee \rangle &gt; 0 \). For the dual root system \( R^\vee \), the same chamber \( C \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i \rangle &gt; 0 \), which is equivalent due to the scaling relationship between roots and coroots.

4. **Verification with Examples**: Checking examples such as \( A_1 \), \( A_2 \), \( B_2 \), and \( G_2 \) confirms that the simple coroots form a base for the dual root system. In each case, the simple coroots correspond to the simple roots of the dual system, ensuring that all positive coroots in \( R^\vee \) are non-negative combinations of the simple coroots.

Thus, the set \( B^\vee \) of simple coroots is indeed a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the set of simple coroots B∨ is always a base for the dual root system R∨. Let me start by recalling some definitions and properties related to root systems, dual root systems, chambers, and bases. 

First, a root system (V, R) consists of a finite set R of non-zero vectors (roots) in a Euclidean space V that satisfy certain axioms, like being closed under reflections and having rational Cartan numbers. The dual root system (V∨, R∨) is formed by taking the coroots α∨ = 2α/(α, α) for each root α in R. 

A chamber C, also known as a Weyl chamber, is a connected component of the complement in V of all the hyperplanes Hα = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0}. Each chamber is an open convex cone, and the group generated by the reflections over the hyperplanes Hα (the Weyl group) acts simply transitively on the chambers. 

For a given chamber C, the corresponding base B = B(C) is the unique set of simple roots {α1, ..., αl} such that C is defined by the intersection of the positive half-spaces determined by the simple roots. That is, C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. The simple roots form a basis of the vector space V and also a basis over the integers for the root lattice. 

Now, the question is whether the set B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} of simple coroots forms a base for the dual root system R∨. To check this, I need to verify if B∨ satisfies the properties of a base when considered in the dual root system. 

A base of a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of the base elements with all coefficients integers of the same sign (either all non-negative or all non-positive). So, for B∨ to be a base of R∨, every coroot β∨ in R∨ should be expressible as a linear combination of the αi∨ with coefficients all non-negative or all non-negative integers. 

First, note that the coroots α∨ are themselves roots in the dual root system R∨. So, B∨ is a subset of R∨. The key point is whether B∨ is a base in the sense of root systems for R∨. 

Given that dual root systems have a duality relationship, I suspect that the simple coroots should form a base for the dual system. However, I need to confirm this carefully. 

Let me recall that in the original root system R, the simple roots B = {α1, ..., αl} form a basis for V and define the positive roots R+ as those roots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple roots. Similarly, the positive coroots R∨+ would be those coroots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple coroots B∨. 

But wait, the coroot of a positive root is not necessarily a positive coroot. Let me check: If β is a positive root in R, then β = Σ niαi with ni ≥ 0. Then β∨ = 2β/(β, β). But how does this relate to the simple coroots? 

Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is that the dual root system R∨ has its own set of simple roots, which may or may not coincide with the simple coroots. 

Alternatively, since the dual of a root system is another root system, with the roles of roots and coroots swapped, perhaps the simple coroots in the original system correspond to the simple roots in the dual system. 

Wait, the coroot system R∨ is a root system in V∨, which is the dual space of V. But if V is equipped with an inner product, we can identify V with V∨, so perhaps they are considered in the same space. Wait, but actually, the coroot α∨ is defined as 2α/(α, α), so if we have a root α in V, then α∨ is in V as well, scaled by 2/(α, α). So the dual root system R∨ is in the same space V, not the dual space. That seems right because the definition of root systems usually includes being in a Euclidean space, and the dual roots are scaled versions. 

Therefore, R∨ is a root system in V, same as R. So the chambers for R∨ would be connected components of V minus the hyperplanes Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, (α∨)∨⟩ = 0}. But (α∨)∨ is equal to α, since the coroot of a coroot is the original root. So Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α⟩ = 0} = Hα. Wait, so the hyperplanes for R∨ are the same as the hyperplanes for R? 

Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s check. For the dual root system R∨, the hyperplanes would be Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β∨∨⟩ = 0}. But β∨ is a root in R∨, so (β∨)∨ = β∨∨ = 2β∨/(β∨, β∨). But β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = 2*(2β/(β, β)) / (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)).

Calculating the inner product in the denominator: (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)) = 4/(β, β)^2 * (β, β) = 4/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = (4β/(β, β)) / (4/(β, β)) ) = β. 

Hence, (β∨)∨ = β. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β⟩ = 0}, which are exactly the same as the hyperplanes Hβ for the original root system R. 

Therefore, the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same. Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of the hyperplanes, are the same for both root systems. 

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. If the hyperplanes are the same, then the chambers are the same. So a chamber C for R is also a chamber for R∨. 

But then, the base B(C) for R is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for each αi in B. Similarly, the base for R∨ corresponding to the same chamber C would be the set of simple roots for R∨, which are the simple coroots? Wait, but the simple roots for R∨ would be the set B∨?

But if the chambers are the same, then the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C should be the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of their positive half-spaces. But in R∨, the positive half-spaces are defined by ⟨x, β∨⟩ &gt; 0 for β∨ in R∨. But since β∨∨ = β, this is equivalent to ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. Wait, but in the original root system, the hyperplanes are defined by ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0. So the positive half-spaces for R∨ would be defined by ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0, where β is a root in R. But these are the same as the positive half-spaces for R, except that in R, the half-spaces are ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let&#x27;s clarify.

In the original root system R, the simple roots α1, ..., αl are such that the chamber C is the set of x in V where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

In the dual root system R∨, the roots are the coroots α∨ for α in R. The chamber for R∨ would be defined in terms of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots in R∨, which are the same hyperplanes as in R. So the chambers for R and R∨ are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the unique set of simple roots β1∨, ..., βl∨ in R∨ such that C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. But since βi∨∨ = βi, this is equivalent to C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. Therefore, in order for B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} to be the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C, we need that C is the set of x where ⟨x, αi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. But since αi∨∨ = αi, this would mean C is the set where ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

However, in the original definition, C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, unless ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is not generally true, these conditions are different. 

Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me check with an example. Let&#x27;s take the root system A1, which is just {α, -α}, with α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If we take the chamber C to be the positive half-line where ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, α⟩ &gt; 0 since α∨ is a positive multiple of α. So in this case, the chamber C is the same whether we use α or α∨. Hence, in this case, the simple coroot α∨ would generate the same chamber as α. 

But wait, in this case, since A1 is self-dual (since α∨ is just a scalar multiple of α), the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, the base for R∨ would just be the same as the base for R. 

But in higher rank root systems, perhaps this is different. Let&#x27;s consider the root system A2, which consists of the roots in the two-dimensional space with simple roots α1 and α2 at 120 degrees. The coroots α1∨ and α2∨ are scaled versions of α1 and α2. Specifically, if α1 and α2 have the same length, then the coroots would be the same roots scaled by 2/(α, α). For example, in the standard normalization where (α, α) = 2, the coroot α∨ is equal to α. But if (α, α) = 1, then α∨ = 2α. 

Wait, in the root system A2, all roots have the same length. Let&#x27;s say the roots are vectors in Euclidean space with length √2, so that (α, α) = 2. Then α∨ = 2α/(α, α) = α. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, in this case, the simple coroots are the same as the simple roots, so B∨ = B, and hence B∨ is a base for R∨, which is R itself. So in this case, yes, B∨ is a base. 

But suppose we have a root system where roots have different lengths, say B2 or G2. Let&#x27;s take B2. In B2, there are long and short roots. Let me recall that in B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The coroots would be α∨ = 2α/(α, α) and β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Since α is long, (α, α) is larger than (β, β). For example, in B2, we can take α = e1 - e2 and β = e2, with (α, α) = 2 and (β, β) = 1. Then α∨ = 2α/2 = α, and β∨ = 2β/1 = 2β. So the coroots in B2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ consists of the roots α and 2β and their negatives, which is actually the root system C2. 

So, in this case, R∨ is of type C2, and the simple coroots for B2 are α and 2β. But in the dual root system C2, the simple roots are different. Wait, the dual root system of B2 is C2, where the simple roots are the coroots of B2. However, in C2, the simple roots are the coroots of B2, so the simple roots for C2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the base B∨ = {α, 2β} is indeed the base for the dual root system C2. 

Wait, but in C2, the simple roots are usually denoted as γ1 and γ2, where γ1 is long and γ2 is short. But in our case, if B2 has simple roots α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ = α and β∨ = 2β, which are the simple roots for C2. Therefore, B∨ is indeed a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in this case, the answer is yes. But let me verify another example. Take G2, which is more complicated. In G2, there are long and short roots, with the ratio of squared lengths being 3. The dual root system of G2 is still G2, since it is self-dual. Wait, but actually, in G2, the roots and coroots have the same length ratio because the ratio of the squares is 3, so when you take coroots, you invert the scaling. Wait, if α is a long root with (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2α/3, and if β is a short root with (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β. So the dual root system would consist of roots 2α/3 and 2β. But is this isomorphic to G2? Wait, G2 is self-dual because the dual of a root system is determined by the inverse of the Cartan matrix, and G2 is simply-laced in some sense? No, G2 is not simply-laced. Wait, maybe it&#x27;s self-dual. Let me recall that in G2, the Cartan matrix is:

[ 2 -3 ]

[-1 2 ]

The inverse of this matrix is:

[2  3]

[1  2] 

divided by determinant, which is 4 - 3 = 1. So the inverse Cartan matrix is the same as the transpose, which would be the Cartan matrix of the dual root system. But since the inverse is not the same as the original, unless we rescale. Wait, but since the Cartan matrix for the dual root system is the transpose of the original Cartan matrix, which for G2 is not symmetric. Wait, but in G2, the Cartan matrix is not symmetric, so its dual root system would have the transpose Cartan matrix, which would correspond to swapping the roots. But in G2, the roots have different lengths, so the dual root system would have the Cartan matrix with entries swapped. However, since G2 is its own dual under the scaling of roots. Let me check if the dual root system is isomorphic to G2.

Wait, if the original roots are long and short, then the coroots would be short and long, respectively. Because α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If α is long, say (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2/3 α, which would be a shorter root. If β is short, (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β, which is longer. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ would have roots that are the coroots of R, which in G2 case are scaled such that the long roots become short and vice versa. But since G2 is self-dual in the sense that the dual root system is isomorphic to the original, just with roots scaled. Therefore, R∨ is isomorphic to R, so the base B∨ would correspond to the base of R∨, which is isomorphic, so yes, B∨ is a base. 

Wait, but if we take the simple roots in G2 as α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ (short) and β∨ (long). Then B∨ would consist of a short root and a long root. In the dual root system R∨, which is isomorphic to G2, the simple roots are these coroots. So, in effect, the base B∨ is a set of simple roots for R∨, which is isomorphic to G2. Therefore, yes, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in all these examples, the set of simple coroots B∨ is indeed a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, perhaps the answer is yes. But I need to ensure there isn&#x27;t some root system where this fails. 

Alternatively, let&#x27;s think abstractly. Since the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same, the chambers are the same. The base for R corresponding to chamber C is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. The base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the set of simple roots δ1, ..., δl in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, δi∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δi∨ = δi (since for R∨, the coroots are the original roots). Wait, no. Wait, in the dual root system R∨, the coroots are (α∨)∨ = α. So if we take R∨, its coroots are the original roots. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = 0} where δ is a root in R∨, i.e., δ = α∨ for some α in R. But δ∨ = (α∨)∨ = α. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = Hα, which are the same as hyperplanes for R. Therefore, as before, chambers are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for those roots. But in R∨, the positive half-space for a root δ ∈ R∨ is defined by ⟨x, δ∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δ ∈ R∨ means δ = β∨ for some β ∈ R. Therefore, ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = ⟨x, (β∨)∨⟩ = ⟨x, β⟩. Therefore, the positive half-space for δ = β∨ is ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all simple roots αi. So if we want the base for R∨, we need the simple roots δj in R∨ such that ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 defines C. But δj∨ = βj, so this becomes ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original system, the chamber C is also defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, if the set of βj is such that ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, then βj must be related to αi∨. 

Wait, this seems a bit circular. Let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have the chamber C. For the original root system R, the simple roots αi are the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. For the dual root system R∨, the simple roots δj must be the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δj∨ is in R, since δj is in R∨. So δj∨ = αj. Therefore, the condition ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, for the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. But in the original system, C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Therefore, unless ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 and ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 define the same chamber, which is only the case if αj and αj∨ are scalar multiples. But αj∨ = 2αj/(αj, αj). Therefore, αj∨ is a scalar multiple of αj. Hence, the half-space ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is the same as ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 if and only if the scalar is positive, which it is. Since 2/(αj, αj) is positive, then yes, ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the chamber C is defined equivalently by either ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 or ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, in the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the set of simple roots for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the set of δj such that δj∨ = αj, which implies δj = αj∨. Therefore, the simple roots for R∨ are exactly the simple coroots B∨. 

Therefore, this shows that the set B∨ is indeed the base for the dual root system R∨ corresponding to the chamber C. 

Thus, in general, the simple coroots B∨ form a base for the dual root system R∨. 

But let me verify once again. Suppose that in the dual root system R∨, the simple roots are the simple coroots of R. Then the positive coroots in R∨ would be the non-negative linear combinations of the simple coroots. But in R∨, the roots are the coroots of R, so the positive coroots would correspond to the positive roots in R∨. But a positive root in R∨ is a coroot that is a non-negative combination of the simple coroots. However, in the original system, the positive roots are non-negative combinations of the simple roots. There&#x27;s a duality here. 

For example, in the original root system, a positive root is a sum of simple roots with non-negative coefficients. The coroot of a positive root is a positive coroot, but the positive coroots are not necessarily the same as the non-negative combinations of simple coroots. Wait, but if B∨ is a base for R∨, then every positive coroot in R∨ is a non-negative combination of B∨. Let me check with B2 example. 

In B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The positive roots are α, β, α + β, α + 2β. The coroots would be α∨ = α, β∨ = 2β. The positive coroots are α, 2β, α + 2β, 2α + 4β. Wait, no. Wait, the coroots of the roots are:

For α: α∨ = α.

For β: β∨ = 2β.

For α + β: (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/(α + β, α + β). Let&#x27;s compute (α + β, α + β) = (α, α) + 2(α, β) + (β, β). In B2, (α, α) = 2, (β, β) = 1, and (α, β) = -1. Therefore, (α + β, α + β) = 2 + 2*(-1) + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Therefore, (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/1 = 2α + 2β.

Similarly, for α + 2β: (α + 2β, α + 2β) = (α, α) + 4(α, β) + 4(β, β) = 2 + 4*(-1) + 4*1 = 2 -4 +4 = 2. Therefore, (α + 2β)∨ = 2(α + 2β)/2 = α + 2β.

Therefore, the positive coroots in R∨ are α, 2β, 2α + 2β, and α + 2β. 

Now, the simple coroots B∨ = {α∨, β∨} = {α, 2β}. The positive coroots in R∨ should be the non-negative combinations of α and 2β. Let&#x27;s see:

- α is a non-negative combination of α and 2β (1*α + 0*2β).
- 2β is 0*α + 1*2β.
- 2α + 2β is 2*α + 1*2β.
- α + 2β is 1*α + 1*2β.

Therefore, all positive coroots in R∨ are indeed non-negative combinations of the simple coroots B∨. Therefore, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Similarly, if we take a positive coroot like 2α + 2β, which is not a coroot of a simple root, but it is a combination of the simple coroots. Therefore, B∨ satisfies the conditions of a base. 

Hence, through these examples and abstract reasoning, it seems that the simple coroots B∨ indeed form a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the set of simple coroots \( B^\vee = \{\alpha_1^\vee, \ldots, \alpha_l^\vee\} \) forms a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \), we need to verify if \( B^\vee \) satisfies the properties of a base in the dual root system. 

1. **Hyperplanes and Chambers**: The hyperplanes for the dual root system \( R^\vee \) are the same as those for the original root system \( R \). This is because the coroot of a coroot \( (\alpha^\vee)^\vee \) is the original root \( \alpha \). Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of these hyperplanes, are the same for both \( R \) and \( R^\vee \).

2. **Base Definition**: A base for a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of these simple roots with all coefficients integers of the same sign. For \( B^\vee \) to be a base for \( R^\vee \), every coroot \( \beta^\vee \in R^\vee \) must be expressible as a non-negative or non-positive integer combination of the simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \).

3. **Duality Relationship**: The dual root system \( R^\vee \) consists of coroots \( \alpha^\vee \) for each root \( \alpha \in R \). The simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \) are scaled versions of the simple roots \( \alpha_i \). For a chamber \( C \), the base \( B \) of \( R \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i^\vee \rangle &gt; 0 \). For the dual root system \( R^\vee \), the same chamber \( C \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i \rangle &gt; 0 \), which is equivalent due to the scaling relationship between roots and coroots.

4. **Verification with Examples**: Checking examples such as \( A_1 \), \( A_2 \), \( B_2 \), and \( G_2 \) confirms that the simple coroots form a base for the dual root system. In each case, the simple coroots correspond to the simple roots of the dual system, ensuring that all positive coroots in \( R^\vee \) are non-negative combinations of the simple coroots.

Thus, the set \( B^\vee \) of simple coroots is indeed a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the set of simple coroots B∨ is always a base for the dual root system R∨. Let me start by recalling some definitions and properties related to root systems, dual root systems, chambers, and bases. 

First, a root system (V, R) consists of a finite set R of non-zero vectors (roots) in a Euclidean space V that satisfy certain axioms, like being closed under reflections and having rational Cartan numbers. The dual root system (V∨, R∨) is formed by taking the coroots α∨ = 2α/(α, α) for each root α in R. 

A chamber C, also known as a Weyl chamber, is a connected component of the complement in V of all the hyperplanes Hα = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0}. Each chamber is an open convex cone, and the group generated by the reflections over the hyperplanes Hα (the Weyl group) acts simply transitively on the chambers. 

For a given chamber C, the corresponding base B = B(C) is the unique set of simple roots {α1, ..., αl} such that C is defined by the intersection of the positive half-spaces determined by the simple roots. That is, C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. The simple roots form a basis of the vector space V and also a basis over the integers for the root lattice. 

Now, the question is whether the set B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} of simple coroots forms a base for the dual root system R∨. To check this, I need to verify if B∨ satisfies the properties of a base when considered in the dual root system. 

A base of a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of the base elements with all coefficients integers of the same sign (either all non-negative or all non-positive). So, for B∨ to be a base of R∨, every coroot β∨ in R∨ should be expressible as a linear combination of the αi∨ with coefficients all non-negative or all non-negative integers. 

First, note that the coroots α∨ are themselves roots in the dual root system R∨. So, B∨ is a subset of R∨. The key point is whether B∨ is a base in the sense of root systems for R∨. 

Given that dual root systems have a duality relationship, I suspect that the simple coroots should form a base for the dual system. However, I need to confirm this carefully. 

Let me recall that in the original root system R, the simple roots B = {α1, ..., αl} form a basis for V and define the positive roots R+ as those roots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple roots. Similarly, the positive coroots R∨+ would be those coroots which can be written as non-negative integer combinations of the simple coroots B∨. 

But wait, the coroot of a positive root is not necessarily a positive coroot. Let me check: If β is a positive root in R, then β = Σ niαi with ni ≥ 0. Then β∨ = 2β/(β, β). But how does this relate to the simple coroots? 

Alternatively, perhaps the relationship is that the dual root system R∨ has its own set of simple roots, which may or may not coincide with the simple coroots. 

Alternatively, since the dual of a root system is another root system, with the roles of roots and coroots swapped, perhaps the simple coroots in the original system correspond to the simple roots in the dual system. 

Wait, the coroot system R∨ is a root system in V∨, which is the dual space of V. But if V is equipped with an inner product, we can identify V with V∨, so perhaps they are considered in the same space. Wait, but actually, the coroot α∨ is defined as 2α/(α, α), so if we have a root α in V, then α∨ is in V as well, scaled by 2/(α, α). So the dual root system R∨ is in the same space V, not the dual space. That seems right because the definition of root systems usually includes being in a Euclidean space, and the dual roots are scaled versions. 

Therefore, R∨ is a root system in V, same as R. So the chambers for R∨ would be connected components of V minus the hyperplanes Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, (α∨)∨⟩ = 0}. But (α∨)∨ is equal to α, since the coroot of a coroot is the original root. So Hα∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, α⟩ = 0} = Hα. Wait, so the hyperplanes for R∨ are the same as the hyperplanes for R? 

Wait, no. Wait, let&#x27;s check. For the dual root system R∨, the hyperplanes would be Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β∨∨⟩ = 0}. But β∨ is a root in R∨, so (β∨)∨ = β∨∨ = 2β∨/(β∨, β∨). But β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = 2*(2β/(β, β)) / (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)).

Calculating the inner product in the denominator: (2β/(β, β), 2β/(β, β)) = 4/(β, β)^2 * (β, β) = 4/(β, β). Therefore, β∨∨ = (4β/(β, β)) / (4/(β, β)) ) = β. 

Hence, (β∨)∨ = β. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hβ∨ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, β⟩ = 0}, which are exactly the same as the hyperplanes Hβ for the original root system R. 

Therefore, the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same. Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of the hyperplanes, are the same for both root systems. 

Wait, that&#x27;s interesting. If the hyperplanes are the same, then the chambers are the same. So a chamber C for R is also a chamber for R∨. 

But then, the base B(C) for R is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for each αi in B. Similarly, the base for R∨ corresponding to the same chamber C would be the set of simple roots for R∨, which are the simple coroots? Wait, but the simple roots for R∨ would be the set B∨?

But if the chambers are the same, then the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C should be the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of their positive half-spaces. But in R∨, the positive half-spaces are defined by ⟨x, β∨⟩ &gt; 0 for β∨ in R∨. But since β∨∨ = β, this is equivalent to ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. Wait, but in the original root system, the hyperplanes are defined by ⟨x, α∨⟩ = 0. So the positive half-spaces for R∨ would be defined by ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0, where β is a root in R. But these are the same as the positive half-spaces for R, except that in R, the half-spaces are ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let&#x27;s clarify.

In the original root system R, the simple roots α1, ..., αl are such that the chamber C is the set of x in V where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

In the dual root system R∨, the roots are the coroots α∨ for α in R. The chamber for R∨ would be defined in terms of the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots in R∨, which are the same hyperplanes as in R. So the chambers for R and R∨ are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the unique set of simple roots β1∨, ..., βl∨ in R∨ such that C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. But since βi∨∨ = βi, this is equivalent to C = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, βi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i}. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. Therefore, in order for B∨ = {α1∨, ..., αl∨} to be the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C, we need that C is the set of x where ⟨x, αi∨∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. But since αi∨∨ = αi, this would mean C is the set where ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 for all i. 

However, in the original definition, C was defined as the set where ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, unless ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is not generally true, these conditions are different. 

Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me check with an example. Let&#x27;s take the root system A1, which is just {α, -α}, with α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If we take the chamber C to be the positive half-line where ⟨x, α∨⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, α⟩ &gt; 0 since α∨ is a positive multiple of α. So in this case, the chamber C is the same whether we use α or α∨. Hence, in this case, the simple coroot α∨ would generate the same chamber as α. 

But wait, in this case, since A1 is self-dual (since α∨ is just a scalar multiple of α), the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, the base for R∨ would just be the same as the base for R. 

But in higher rank root systems, perhaps this is different. Let&#x27;s consider the root system A2, which consists of the roots in the two-dimensional space with simple roots α1 and α2 at 120 degrees. The coroots α1∨ and α2∨ are scaled versions of α1 and α2. Specifically, if α1 and α2 have the same length, then the coroots would be the same roots scaled by 2/(α, α). For example, in the standard normalization where (α, α) = 2, the coroot α∨ is equal to α. But if (α, α) = 1, then α∨ = 2α. 

Wait, in the root system A2, all roots have the same length. Let&#x27;s say the roots are vectors in Euclidean space with length √2, so that (α, α) = 2. Then α∨ = 2α/(α, α) = α. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ is the same as R. Therefore, in this case, the simple coroots are the same as the simple roots, so B∨ = B, and hence B∨ is a base for R∨, which is R itself. So in this case, yes, B∨ is a base. 

But suppose we have a root system where roots have different lengths, say B2 or G2. Let&#x27;s take B2. In B2, there are long and short roots. Let me recall that in B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The coroots would be α∨ = 2α/(α, α) and β∨ = 2β/(β, β). Since α is long, (α, α) is larger than (β, β). For example, in B2, we can take α = e1 - e2 and β = e2, with (α, α) = 2 and (β, β) = 1. Then α∨ = 2α/2 = α, and β∨ = 2β/1 = 2β. So the coroots in B2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ consists of the roots α and 2β and their negatives, which is actually the root system C2. 

So, in this case, R∨ is of type C2, and the simple coroots for B2 are α and 2β. But in the dual root system C2, the simple roots are different. Wait, the dual root system of B2 is C2, where the simple roots are the coroots of B2. However, in C2, the simple roots are the coroots of B2, so the simple roots for C2 are α and 2β. Therefore, the base B∨ = {α, 2β} is indeed the base for the dual root system C2. 

Wait, but in C2, the simple roots are usually denoted as γ1 and γ2, where γ1 is long and γ2 is short. But in our case, if B2 has simple roots α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ = α and β∨ = 2β, which are the simple roots for C2. Therefore, B∨ is indeed a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in this case, the answer is yes. But let me verify another example. Take G2, which is more complicated. In G2, there are long and short roots, with the ratio of squared lengths being 3. The dual root system of G2 is still G2, since it is self-dual. Wait, but actually, in G2, the roots and coroots have the same length ratio because the ratio of the squares is 3, so when you take coroots, you invert the scaling. Wait, if α is a long root with (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2α/3, and if β is a short root with (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β. So the dual root system would consist of roots 2α/3 and 2β. But is this isomorphic to G2? Wait, G2 is self-dual because the dual of a root system is determined by the inverse of the Cartan matrix, and G2 is simply-laced in some sense? No, G2 is not simply-laced. Wait, maybe it&#x27;s self-dual. Let me recall that in G2, the Cartan matrix is:

[ 2 -3 ]

[-1 2 ]

The inverse of this matrix is:

[2  3]

[1  2] 

divided by determinant, which is 4 - 3 = 1. So the inverse Cartan matrix is the same as the transpose, which would be the Cartan matrix of the dual root system. But since the inverse is not the same as the original, unless we rescale. Wait, but since the Cartan matrix for the dual root system is the transpose of the original Cartan matrix, which for G2 is not symmetric. Wait, but in G2, the Cartan matrix is not symmetric, so its dual root system would have the transpose Cartan matrix, which would correspond to swapping the roots. But in G2, the roots have different lengths, so the dual root system would have the Cartan matrix with entries swapped. However, since G2 is its own dual under the scaling of roots. Let me check if the dual root system is isomorphic to G2.

Wait, if the original roots are long and short, then the coroots would be short and long, respectively. Because α∨ = 2α/(α, α). If α is long, say (α, α) = 3, then α∨ = 2/3 α, which would be a shorter root. If β is short, (β, β) = 1, then β∨ = 2β, which is longer. Therefore, the dual root system R∨ would have roots that are the coroots of R, which in G2 case are scaled such that the long roots become short and vice versa. But since G2 is self-dual in the sense that the dual root system is isomorphic to the original, just with roots scaled. Therefore, R∨ is isomorphic to R, so the base B∨ would correspond to the base of R∨, which is isomorphic, so yes, B∨ is a base. 

Wait, but if we take the simple roots in G2 as α (long) and β (short), then their coroots are α∨ (short) and β∨ (long). Then B∨ would consist of a short root and a long root. In the dual root system R∨, which is isomorphic to G2, the simple roots are these coroots. So, in effect, the base B∨ is a set of simple roots for R∨, which is isomorphic to G2. Therefore, yes, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Therefore, in all these examples, the set of simple coroots B∨ is indeed a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, perhaps the answer is yes. But I need to ensure there isn&#x27;t some root system where this fails. 

Alternatively, let&#x27;s think abstractly. Since the hyperplanes for R and R∨ are the same, the chambers are the same. The base for R corresponding to chamber C is the set of simple roots such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. The base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C would be the set of simple roots δ1, ..., δl in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces ⟨x, δi∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δi∨ = δi (since for R∨, the coroots are the original roots). Wait, no. Wait, in the dual root system R∨, the coroots are (α∨)∨ = α. So if we take R∨, its coroots are the original roots. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = {x ∈ V : ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = 0} where δ is a root in R∨, i.e., δ = α∨ for some α in R. But δ∨ = (α∨)∨ = α. Therefore, the hyperplanes for R∨ are Hδ = Hα, which are the same as hyperplanes for R. Therefore, as before, chambers are the same. 

Therefore, the base for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the unique minimal set of roots in R∨ such that C is the intersection of the positive half-spaces for those roots. But in R∨, the positive half-space for a root δ ∈ R∨ is defined by ⟨x, δ∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δ ∈ R∨ means δ = β∨ for some β ∈ R. Therefore, ⟨x, δ∨⟩ = ⟨x, (β∨)∨⟩ = ⟨x, β⟩. Therefore, the positive half-space for δ = β∨ is ⟨x, β⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original root system R, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 for all simple roots αi. So if we want the base for R∨, we need the simple roots δj in R∨ such that ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 defines C. But δj∨ = βj, so this becomes ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0. 

But in the original system, the chamber C is also defined by ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, if the set of βj is such that ⟨x, βj⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0, then βj must be related to αi∨. 

Wait, this seems a bit circular. Let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have the chamber C. For the original root system R, the simple roots αi are the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. For the dual root system R∨, the simple roots δj must be the unique minimal set such that C is the intersection of ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0. But δj∨ is in R, since δj is in R∨. So δj∨ = αj. Therefore, the condition ⟨x, δj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, for the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. But in the original system, C is the intersection of ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0. 

Therefore, unless ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 and ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 define the same chamber, which is only the case if αj and αj∨ are scalar multiples. But αj∨ = 2αj/(αj, αj). Therefore, αj∨ is a scalar multiple of αj. Hence, the half-space ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is the same as ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0 if and only if the scalar is positive, which it is. Since 2/(αj, αj) is positive, then yes, ⟨x, αj∨⟩ &gt; 0 is equivalent to ⟨x, αj⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the chamber C is defined equivalently by either ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0 or ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, in the dual root system R∨, the chamber C is defined by ⟨x, αi⟩ &gt; 0, which is equivalent to ⟨x, αi∨⟩ &gt; 0. Therefore, the set of simple roots for R∨ corresponding to chamber C is the set of δj such that δj∨ = αj, which implies δj = αj∨. Therefore, the simple roots for R∨ are exactly the simple coroots B∨. 

Therefore, this shows that the set B∨ is indeed the base for the dual root system R∨ corresponding to the chamber C. 

Thus, in general, the simple coroots B∨ form a base for the dual root system R∨. 

But let me verify once again. Suppose that in the dual root system R∨, the simple roots are the simple coroots of R. Then the positive coroots in R∨ would be the non-negative linear combinations of the simple coroots. But in R∨, the roots are the coroots of R, so the positive coroots would correspond to the positive roots in R∨. But a positive root in R∨ is a coroot that is a non-negative combination of the simple coroots. However, in the original system, the positive roots are non-negative combinations of the simple roots. There&#x27;s a duality here. 

For example, in the original root system, a positive root is a sum of simple roots with non-negative coefficients. The coroot of a positive root is a positive coroot, but the positive coroots are not necessarily the same as the non-negative combinations of simple coroots. Wait, but if B∨ is a base for R∨, then every positive coroot in R∨ is a non-negative combination of B∨. Let me check with B2 example. 

In B2, the simple roots are α (long) and β (short). The positive roots are α, β, α + β, α + 2β. The coroots would be α∨ = α, β∨ = 2β. The positive coroots are α, 2β, α + 2β, 2α + 4β. Wait, no. Wait, the coroots of the roots are:

For α: α∨ = α.

For β: β∨ = 2β.

For α + β: (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/(α + β, α + β). Let&#x27;s compute (α + β, α + β) = (α, α) + 2(α, β) + (β, β). In B2, (α, α) = 2, (β, β) = 1, and (α, β) = -1. Therefore, (α + β, α + β) = 2 + 2*(-1) + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Therefore, (α + β)∨ = 2(α + β)/1 = 2α + 2β.

Similarly, for α + 2β: (α + 2β, α + 2β) = (α, α) + 4(α, β) + 4(β, β) = 2 + 4*(-1) + 4*1 = 2 -4 +4 = 2. Therefore, (α + 2β)∨ = 2(α + 2β)/2 = α + 2β.

Therefore, the positive coroots in R∨ are α, 2β, 2α + 2β, and α + 2β. 

Now, the simple coroots B∨ = {α∨, β∨} = {α, 2β}. The positive coroots in R∨ should be the non-negative combinations of α and 2β. Let&#x27;s see:

- α is a non-negative combination of α and 2β (1*α + 0*2β).
- 2β is 0*α + 1*2β.
- 2α + 2β is 2*α + 1*2β.
- α + 2β is 1*α + 1*2β.

Therefore, all positive coroots in R∨ are indeed non-negative combinations of the simple coroots B∨. Therefore, B∨ is a base for R∨. 

Similarly, if we take a positive coroot like 2α + 2β, which is not a coroot of a simple root, but it is a combination of the simple coroots. Therefore, B∨ satisfies the conditions of a base. 

Hence, through these examples and abstract reasoning, it seems that the simple coroots B∨ indeed form a base for the dual root system R∨. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the set of simple coroots \( B^\vee = \{\alpha_1^\vee, \ldots, \alpha_l^\vee\} \) forms a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \), we need to verify if \( B^\vee \) satisfies the properties of a base in the dual root system. 

1. **Hyperplanes and Chambers**: The hyperplanes for the dual root system \( R^\vee \) are the same as those for the original root system \( R \). This is because the coroot of a coroot \( (\alpha^\vee)^\vee \) is the original root \( \alpha \). Therefore, the chambers, which are connected components of the complement of these hyperplanes, are the same for both \( R \) and \( R^\vee \).

2. **Base Definition**: A base for a root system is a set of simple roots such that every root can be written as a linear combination of these simple roots with all coefficients integers of the same sign. For \( B^\vee \) to be a base for \( R^\vee \), every coroot \( \beta^\vee \in R^\vee \) must be expressible as a non-negative or non-positive integer combination of the simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \).

3. **Duality Relationship**: The dual root system \( R^\vee \) consists of coroots \( \alpha^\vee \) for each root \( \alpha \in R \). The simple coroots \( \alpha_i^\vee \) are scaled versions of the simple roots \( \alpha_i \). For a chamber \( C \), the base \( B \) of \( R \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i^\vee \rangle &gt; 0 \). For the dual root system \( R^\vee \), the same chamber \( C \) is defined by the intersection of positive half-spaces \( \langle x, \alpha_i \rangle &gt; 0 \), which is equivalent due to the scaling relationship between roots and coroots.

4. **Verification with Examples**: Checking examples such as \( A_1 \), \( A_2 \), \( B_2 \), and \( G_2 \) confirms that the simple coroots form a base for the dual root system. In each case, the simple coroots correspond to the simple roots of the dual system, ensuring that all positive coroots in \( R^\vee \) are non-negative combinations of the simple coroots.

Thus, the set \( B^\vee \) of simple coroots is indeed a base for the dual root system \( R^\vee \).

Reference Answer: We place the diagram in the complex plane, so that the vertices $A$, $A&#x27;$, $B$, $B&#x27;$, $C$, and $C&#x27;$ go to the complex numbers $a$, $a&#x27;$, $b$, $b&#x27;$, $c$, and $c&#x27;$, respectively.

To get to $a&#x27;$, we rotate the line segment joining $b$ to $c$ by $90^\circ$ (which we achieve by multiplying $c - b$ by $i$).  Also, we want $AA&#x27; = kBC$, so we multiply this complex number by $k$ as well.  Hence,
\[a&#x27; = a + ki(c - b).\]Similarly,
\begin{align*}
b&#x27; &amp;= b + ki(a - c), \\
c&#x27; &amp;= c + ki(b - a).

We want triangle $A&#x27;B&#x27;C&#x27;$ to be equilateral, so we want $a&#x27;$, $b&#x27;$, and $c&#x27;$ to satisfy
\[c&#x27; - a&#x27; = e^{\pi i/3} (b&#x27; - a&#x27;).\]Substituting our expressions for $a&#x27;$, $b&#x27;$, and $c&#x27;$, and using the fact that
\[e^{\pi i/3} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i,\]we get
\[c + ki(b - a) - a - ki(c - b) = \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i \right) [b + ki(a - c) - a - ki(c - b)].\]Expanding and simplifying both sides, we get
\begin{align*}
&amp;(-1 - ki) a + 2ki b + (1 - ki) c \\
&amp;= \frac{-k \sqrt{3} - 1 + ki - i \sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot a + \frac{- k \sqrt{3} + 1 + ki + i \sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot b + (k \sqrt{3} - ki) c.
\end{align*}We want the coefficients of $a$, $b$, and $c$ to be equal on both sides.  Equating the coefficients of $c$, we get
\[1 - ki = k \sqrt{3} - ki,\]so $k = 1/\sqrt{3}$.  For this value of $k$, both coefficients of $a$ become $-1 - i/\sqrt{3}$, and both coefficients of $b$ become $2i/\sqrt{3}$.

Hence, the value of $k$ that works is $k = \boxed{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}$.          </p>

Reference Answer: We place the diagram in the complex plane, so that the vertices $A$, $A&#x27;$, $B$, $B&#x27;$, $C$, and $C&#x27;$ go to the complex numbers $a$, $a&#x27;$, $b$, $b&#x27;$, $c$, and $c&#x27;$, respectively.

To get to $a&#x27;$, we rotate the line segment joining $b$ to $c$ by $90^\circ$ (which we achieve by multiplying $c - b$ by $i$).  Also, we want $AA&#x27; = kBC$, so we multiply this complex number by $k$ as well.  Hence,
\[a&#x27; = a + ki(c - b).\]Similarly,

\end{align*}We want the coefficients of $a$, $b$, and $c$ to be equal on both sides.  Equating the coefficients of $c$, we get
\[1 - ki = k \sqrt{3} - ki,\]so $k = 1/\sqrt{3}$.  For this value of $k$, both coefficients of $a$ become $-1 - i/\sqrt{3}$, and both coefficients of $b$ become $2i/\sqrt{3}$.

Reference Answer: We place the diagram in the complex plane, so that the vertices $A$, $A&#x27;$, $B$, $B&#x27;$, $C$, and $C&#x27;$ go to the complex numbers $a$, $a&#x27;$, $b$, $b&#x27;$, $c$, and $c&#x27;$, respectively.

To get to $a&#x27;$, we rotate the line segment joining $b$ to $c$ by $90^\circ$ (which we achieve by multiplying $c - b$ by $i$).  Also, we want $AA&#x27; = kBC$, so we multiply this complex number by $k$ as well.  Hence,
\[a&#x27; = a + ki(c - b).\]Similarly,
\begin{align*}
b&#x27; &amp;= b + ki(a - c), \\

\[c&#x27; - a&#x27; = e^{\pi i/3} (b&#x27; - a&#x27;).\]Substituting our expressions for $a&#x27;$, $b&#x27;$, and $c&#x27;$, and using the fact that
\[e^{\pi i/3} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i,\]we get
\[c + ki(b - a) - a - ki(c - b) = \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i \right) [b + ki(a - c) - a - ki(c - b)].\]Expanding and simplifying both sides, we get
\begin{align*}

&amp;= \frac{-k \sqrt{3} - 1 + ki - i \sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot a + \frac{- k \sqrt{3} + 1 + ki + i \sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot b + (k \sqrt{3} - ki) c.
\end{align*}We want the coefficients of $a$, $b$, and $c$ to be equal on both sides.  Equating the coefficients of $c$, we get
\[1 - ki = k \sqrt{3} - ki,\]so $k = 1/\sqrt{3}$.  For this value of $k$, both coefficients of $a$ become $-1 - i/\sqrt{3}$, and both coefficients of $b$ become $2i/\sqrt{3}$.

Hence, the value of $k$ that works is $k = \boxed{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}$.          </p>

Reference Answer: We place the diagram in the complex plane, so that the vertices $A$, $A&#x27;$, $B$, $B&#x27;$, $C$, and $C&#x27;$ go to the complex numbers $a$, $a&#x27;$, $b$, $b&#x27;$, $c$, and $c&#x27;$, respectively.

To get to $a&#x27;$, we rotate the line segment joining $b$ to $c$ by $90^\circ$ (which we achieve by multiplying $c - b$ by $i$).  Also, we want $AA&#x27; = kBC$, so we multiply this complex number by $k$ as well.  Hence,
\[a&#x27; = a + ki(c - b).\]Similarly,
\begin{align*}
b&#x27; &amp;= b + ki(a - c), \\
c&#x27; &amp;= c + ki(b - a).

We want triangle $A&#x27;B&#x27;C&#x27;$ to be equilateral, so we want $a&#x27;$, $b&#x27;$, and $c&#x27;$ to satisfy
\[c&#x27; - a&#x27; = e^{\pi i/3} (b&#x27; - a&#x27;).\]Substituting our expressions for $a&#x27;$, $b&#x27;$, and $c&#x27;$, and using the fact that
\[e^{\pi i/3} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i,\]we get
\[c + ki(b - a) - a - ki(c - b) = \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} i \right) [b + ki(a - c) - a - ki(c - b)].\]Expanding and simplifying both sides, we get
\begin{align*}
&amp;(-1 - ki) a + 2ki b + (1 - ki) c \\
&amp;= \frac{-k \sqrt{3} - 1 + ki - i \sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot a + \frac{- k \sqrt{3} + 1 + ki + i \sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot b + (k \sqrt{3} - ki) c.
\end{align*}We want the coefficients of $a$, $b$, and $c$ to be equal on both sides.  Equating the coefficients of $c$, we get
\[1 - ki = k \sqrt{3} - ki,\]so $k = 1/\sqrt{3}$.  For this value of $k$, both coefficients of $a$ become $-1 - i/\sqrt{3}$, and both coefficients of $b$ become $2i/\sqrt{3}$.

Hence, the value of $k$ that works is $k = \boxed{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}$.          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if this statement is true or false. Let me start by breaking it down. The statement says: If (n² aₙ) is a convergent sequence, then there exists a subsequence (x_{n_k}) of xₙ = sin(n)/n such that the series ∑_{k=1}^∞ x_{n_k} a_k converges.

First, let&#x27;s parse the given conditions and the conclusion. The hypothesis is that n² aₙ converges. So, that means as n approaches infinity, n² aₙ approaches some limit, say L. Therefore, aₙ must be behaving like L / n² for large n. So, aₙ is O(1/n²). Which would imply that the series ∑ aₙ converges absolutely, since the sum of 1/n² converges.

Then, the conclusion is that there exists a subsequence of xₙ = sin(n)/n such that the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges. So, xₙ itself is sin(n)/n, which is a bounded sequence because |sin(n)| ≤ 1, so |xₙ| ≤ 1/n. Then, the terms xₙ are O(1/n), and the series ∑ xₙ is conditionally convergent (since ∑ sin(n)/n converges conditionally by Dirichlet&#x27;s test, but not absolutely because ∑ 1/n diverges).

But here we&#x27;re allowed to take a subsequence of xₙ, so x_{n_k} = sin(n_k)/n_k, and sum over k of sin(n_k)/n_k * a_k. The question is whether such a subsequence exists so that this series converges.

Given that aₖ is O(1/k²), then each term x_{n_k} a_k is O(1/(n_k k²)). But since n_k is a subsequence, n_k ≥ k, right? Because in a subsequence, the indices are increasing. So n_k ≥ k for all k. Therefore, 1/(n_k k²) ≤ 1/k³. So then the terms x_{n_k} a_k are O(1/k³), and ∑ 1/k³ converges absolutely. Therefore, if we can bound |x_{n_k} a_k| ≤ C /k³ for some constant C, then the series would converge absolutely.

But wait, hold on. Is that the case? Let&#x27;s see. If aₖ is O(1/k²), then |aₖ| ≤ C /k² for some constant C. Also, |x_{n_k}| = |sin(n_k)/n_k| ≤ 1/n_k. Since n_k ≥ k, as I mentioned, then 1/n_k ≤ 1/k. Therefore, |x_{n_k} a_k| ≤ (1/n_k)(C /k²) ≤ C / (k^3). Therefore, the terms are bounded by C /k³, whose sum converges. Therefore, by the comparison test, the series ∑ |x_{n_k} a_k| converges, so the original series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges absolutely.

Wait, but does that mean that no matter what subsequence we pick, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges absolutely? But the problem is asking whether there exists a subsequence (x_{n_k}) such that the series converges. If what I just thought is correct, then actually for any subsequence (x_{n_k}), the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k would converge absolutely, because the terms are bounded by 1/k³. Therefore, the statement is trivially true? Because you can take any subsequence, and the series would converge.

But that seems too straightforward, so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me verify again. The key point is that aₖ is O(1/k²), and x_{n_k} is O(1/n_k). But since n_k ≥ k, then 1/n_k ≤ 1/k, so x_{n_k} a_k is O(1/k³). Hence, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k is dominated by a convergent series. Therefore, the conclusion holds for any subsequence. Therefore, the existence is trivial, because every subsequence would work. Therefore, the statement is true.

But wait, that can&#x27;t be right, because x_{n} is sin(n)/n, which is conditionally convergent. But here we&#x27;re summing x_{n_k} a_k, not x_{n_k}. Since a_k is summable (because it&#x27;s O(1/k²)), and x_{n_k} is bounded by 1/k, then the product is O(1/k³). Therefore, regardless of the signs or oscillations, the series converges absolutely. Therefore, regardless of the choice of subsequence, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges absolutely. Therefore, the answer is true, because such a subsequence exists—in fact, all subsequences work.

But wait, let me test with an example. Let&#x27;s suppose that aₖ = 1/k². Then, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k would be ∑ sin(n_k)/(n_k k²). Since |sin(n_k)| ≤ 1, then |sin(n_k)/(n_k k²)| ≤ 1/(n_k k²) ≤ 1/k³, as before. Therefore, the series converges absolutely. Therefore, regardless of how we choose the subsequence n_k, we have absolute convergence.

Hence, the answer should be True. But wait, let me check if there is a possible loophole here.

Wait, the problem states that (n² aₙ) is convergent. So, maybe the limit is not necessarily zero? Wait, no. If n² aₙ converges, then its limit must exist. Let&#x27;s denote the limit as L. Then, if L ≠ 0, then aₙ ~ L /n², so aₙ is asymptotically L/n². If L = 0, then aₙ is o(1/n²). But in either case, aₙ is O(1/n²), so the same reasoning applies. Therefore, |aₖ| ≤ C /k² for some C, and hence |x_{n_k} aₖ| ≤ C / (n_k k²) ≤ C /k³, so the series converges absolutely. Therefore, regardless of the subsequence, the series converges.

Therefore, the statement is actually stronger: not only does there exist a subsequence, but in fact every subsequence would work. Therefore, the answer is True.

Wait, but maybe I&#x27;m missing something here. Let me consider if aₖ could be negative or have varying signs. However, even if aₖ has varying signs, the absolute convergence would still hold because |x_{n_k} aₖ| is still bounded by C /k³. Therefore, regardless of the signs, the series ∑ x_{n_k} aₖ converges absolutely. So even if aₖ is signed, since we are multiplying by another term x_{n_k} which is also bounded, the absolute convergence is maintained.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the statement is True, because any subsequence of xₙ would result in the series ∑ x_{n_k} aₖ being absolutely convergent, given that aₖ is O(1/k²). Hence, such a subsequence exists (in fact, all of them do), so the statement is true.

But wait, let me check again. The problem says &quot;there exists a subsequence (x_{n_k})&quot; so that the series converges. Since all subsequences work, then certainly at least one exists. Therefore, the statement is true.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me, but in this case, the reasoning seems solid. Because the key point is that the product x_{n_k} aₖ is O(1/k³), so regardless of the choice of subsequence, the series converges. Therefore, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{True}

Given that \((n^2 a_n)\) is a convergent sequence, we know that \(a_n\) must be \(O(1/n^2)\). This implies that the series \(\sum a_n\) converges absolutely. 

We need to determine if there exists a subsequence \((x_{n_k})\) of \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\) such that the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges. 

Since \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\), we have \(|x_n| \leq \frac{1}{n}\). For any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\), the terms \(|x_{n_k}| \leq \frac{1}{n_k}\). Given that \(n_k \geq k\) for all \(k\), it follows that \(\frac{1}{n_k} \leq \frac{1}{k}\). 

Given \(a_k\) is \(O(1/k^2)\), we have \(|a_k| \leq \frac{C}{k^2}\) for some constant \(C\). Therefore, the product term \(|x_{n_k} a_k| \leq \frac{C}{n_k k^2} \leq \frac{C}{k^3}\). 

The series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\) is a convergent p-series with \(p = 3 &gt; 1\). By the comparison test, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} |x_{n_k} a_k|\) converges absolutely. Hence, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges absolutely for any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\).

Since any subsequence will work, there certainly exists such a subsequence. Therefore, the statement is true.

Given that \((n^2 a_n)\) is a convergent sequence, we know that \(a_n\) must be \(O(1/n^2)\). This implies that the series \(\sum a_n\) converges absolutely. 

We need to determine if there exists a subsequence \((x_{n_k})\) of \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\) such that the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges. 

Since \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\), we have \(|x_n| \leq \frac{1}{n}\). For any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\), the terms \(|x_{n_k}| \leq \frac{1}{n_k}\). Given that \(n_k \geq k\) for all \(k\), it follows that \(\frac{1}{n_k} \leq \frac{1}{k}\). 

Given \(a_k\) is \(O(1/k^2)\), we have \(|a_k| \leq \frac{C}{k^2}\) for some constant \(C\). Therefore, the product term \(|x_{n_k} a_k| \leq \frac{C}{n_k k^2} \leq \frac{C}{k^3}\). 

The series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\) is a convergent p-series with \(p = 3 &gt; 1\). By the comparison test, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} |x_{n_k} a_k|\) converges absolutely. Hence, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges absolutely for any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\).

Since any subsequence will work, there certainly exists such a subsequence. Therefore, the statement is true.

So, xₙ itself is sin(n)/n, which is a bounded sequence because |sin(n)| ≤ 1, so |xₙ| ≤ 1/n. Then, the terms xₙ are O(1/n), and the series ∑ xₙ is conditionally convergent (since ∑ sin(n)/n converges conditionally by Dirichlet&#x27;s test, but not absolutely because ∑ 1/n diverges).

But here we&#x27;re allowed to take a subsequence of xₙ, so x_{n_k} = sin(n_k)/n_k, and sum over k of sin(n_k)/n_k * a_k. The question is whether such a subsequence exists so that this series converges.

Given that aₖ is O(1/k²), then each term x_{n_k} a_k is O(1/(n_k k²)). But since n_k is a subsequence, n_k ≥ k, right? Because in a subsequence, the indices are increasing. So n_k ≥ k for all k. Therefore, 1/(n_k k²) ≤ 1/k³. So then the terms x_{n_k} a_k are O(1/k³), and ∑ 1/k³ converges absolutely. Therefore, if we can bound |x_{n_k} a_k| ≤ C /k³ for some constant C, then the series would converge absolutely.

But wait, hold on. Is that the case? Let&#x27;s see. If aₖ is O(1/k²), then |aₖ| ≤ C /k² for some constant C. Also, |x_{n_k}| = |sin(n_k)/n_k| ≤ 1/n_k. Since n_k ≥ k, as I mentioned, then 1/n_k ≤ 1/k. Therefore, |x_{n_k} a_k| ≤ (1/n_k)(C /k²) ≤ C / (k^3). Therefore, the terms are bounded by C /k³, whose sum converges. Therefore, by the comparison test, the series ∑ |x_{n_k} a_k| converges, so the original series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges absolutely.

Wait, but does that mean that no matter what subsequence we pick, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges absolutely? But the problem is asking whether there exists a subsequence (x_{n_k}) such that the series converges. If what I just thought is correct, then actually for any subsequence (x_{n_k}), the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k would converge absolutely, because the terms are bounded by 1/k³. Therefore, the statement is trivially true? Because you can take any subsequence, and the series would converge.

But that seems too straightforward, so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me verify again. The key point is that aₖ is O(1/k²), and x_{n_k} is O(1/n_k). But since n_k ≥ k, then 1/n_k ≤ 1/k, so x_{n_k} a_k is O(1/k³). Hence, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k is dominated by a convergent series. Therefore, the conclusion holds for any subsequence. Therefore, the existence is trivial, because every subsequence would work. Therefore, the statement is true.

But wait, that can&#x27;t be right, because x_{n} is sin(n)/n, which is conditionally convergent. But here we&#x27;re summing x_{n_k} a_k, not x_{n_k}. Since a_k is summable (because it&#x27;s O(1/k²)), and x_{n_k} is bounded by 1/k, then the product is O(1/k³). Therefore, regardless of the signs or oscillations, the series converges absolutely. Therefore, regardless of the choice of subsequence, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges absolutely. Therefore, the answer is true, because such a subsequence exists—in fact, all subsequences work.

But wait, let me test with an example. Let&#x27;s suppose that aₖ = 1/k². Then, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k would be ∑ sin(n_k)/(n_k k²). Since |sin(n_k)| ≤ 1, then |sin(n_k)/(n_k k²)| ≤ 1/(n_k k²) ≤ 1/k³, as before. Therefore, the series converges absolutely. Therefore, regardless of how we choose the subsequence n_k, we have absolute convergence.

Hence, the answer should be True. But wait, let me check if there is a possible loophole here.

Wait, the problem states that (n² aₙ) is convergent. So, maybe the limit is not necessarily zero? Wait, no. If n² aₙ converges, then its limit must exist. Let&#x27;s denote the limit as L. Then, if L ≠ 0, then aₙ ~ L /n², so aₙ is asymptotically L/n². If L = 0, then aₙ is o(1/n²). But in either case, aₙ is O(1/n²), so the same reasoning applies. Therefore, |aₖ| ≤ C /k² for some C, and hence |x_{n_k} aₖ| ≤ C / (n_k k²) ≤ C /k³, so the series converges absolutely. Therefore, regardless of the subsequence, the series converges.

Therefore, the statement is actually stronger: not only does there exist a subsequence, but in fact every subsequence would work. Therefore, the answer is True.

Wait, but maybe I&#x27;m missing something here. Let me consider if aₖ could be negative or have varying signs. However, even if aₖ has varying signs, the absolute convergence would still hold because |x_{n_k} aₖ| is still bounded by C /k³. Therefore, regardless of the signs, the series ∑ x_{n_k} aₖ converges absolutely. So even if aₖ is signed, since we are multiplying by another term x_{n_k} which is also bounded, the absolute convergence is maintained.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the statement is True, because any subsequence of xₙ would result in the series ∑ x_{n_k} aₖ being absolutely convergent, given that aₖ is O(1/k²). Hence, such a subsequence exists (in fact, all of them do), so the statement is true.

But wait, let me check again. The problem says &quot;there exists a subsequence (x_{n_k})&quot; so that the series converges. Since all subsequences work, then certainly at least one exists. Therefore, the statement is true.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me, but in this case, the reasoning seems solid. Because the key point is that the product x_{n_k} aₖ is O(1/k³), so regardless of the choice of subsequence, the series converges. Therefore, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{True}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given that \((n^2 a_n)\) is a convergent sequence, we know that \(a_n\) must be \(O(1/n^2)\). This implies that the series \(\sum a_n\) converges absolutely. 

We need to determine if there exists a subsequence \((x_{n_k})\) of \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\) such that the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges. 

Since \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\), we have \(|x_n| \leq \frac{1}{n}\). For any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\), the terms \(|x_{n_k}| \leq \frac{1}{n_k}\). Given that \(n_k \geq k\) for all \(k\), it follows that \(\frac{1}{n_k} \leq \frac{1}{k}\). 

Given \(a_k\) is \(O(1/k^2)\), we have \(|a_k| \leq \frac{C}{k^2}\) for some constant \(C\). Therefore, the product term \(|x_{n_k} a_k| \leq \frac{C}{n_k k^2} \leq \frac{C}{k^3}\). 

The series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\) is a convergent p-series with \(p = 3 &gt; 1\). By the comparison test, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} |x_{n_k} a_k|\) converges absolutely. Hence, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges absolutely for any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\).

Since any subsequence will work, there certainly exists such a subsequence. Therefore, the statement is true.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if this statement is true or false. Let me start by breaking it down. The statement says: If (n² aₙ) is a convergent sequence, then there exists a subsequence (x_{n_k}) of xₙ = sin(n)/n such that the series ∑_{k=1}^∞ x_{n_k} a_k converges.

First, let&#x27;s parse the given conditions and the conclusion. The hypothesis is that n² aₙ converges. So, that means as n approaches infinity, n² aₙ approaches some limit, say L. Therefore, aₙ must be behaving like L / n² for large n. So, aₙ is O(1/n²). Which would imply that the series ∑ aₙ converges absolutely, since the sum of 1/n² converges.

So, xₙ itself is sin(n)/n, which is a bounded sequence because |sin(n)| ≤ 1, so |xₙ| ≤ 1/n. Then, the terms xₙ are O(1/n), and the series ∑ xₙ is conditionally convergent (since ∑ sin(n)/n converges conditionally by Dirichlet&#x27;s test, but not absolutely because ∑ 1/n diverges).

But here we&#x27;re allowed to take a subsequence of xₙ, so x_{n_k} = sin(n_k)/n_k, and sum over k of sin(n_k)/n_k * a_k. The question is whether such a subsequence exists so that this series converges.

Therefore, 1/(n_k k²) ≤ 1/k³. So then the terms x_{n_k} a_k are O(1/k³), and ∑ 1/k³ converges absolutely. Therefore, if we can bound |x_{n_k} a_k| ≤ C /k³ for some constant C, then the series would converge absolutely.

Given that \((n^2 a_n)\) is a convergent sequence, we know that \(a_n\) must be \(O(1/n^2)\). This implies that the series \(\sum a_n\) converges absolutely. 

We need to determine if there exists a subsequence \((x_{n_k})\) of \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\) such that the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges. 

Since \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\), we have \(|x_n| \leq \frac{1}{n}\). For any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\), the terms \(|x_{n_k}| \leq \frac{1}{n_k}\). Given that \(n_k \geq k\) for all \(k\), it follows that \(\frac{1}{n_k} \leq \frac{1}{k}\). 

Given \(a_k\) is \(O(1/k^2)\), we have \(|a_k| \leq \frac{C}{k^2}\) for some constant \(C\). Therefore, the product term \(|x_{n_k} a_k| \leq \frac{C}{n_k k^2} \leq \frac{C}{k^3}\). 

The series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\) is a convergent p-series with \(p = 3 &gt; 1\). By the comparison test, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} |x_{n_k} a_k|\) converges absolutely. Hence, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges absolutely for any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\).

Since any subsequence will work, there certainly exists such a subsequence. Therefore, the statement is true.

First, let&#x27;s parse the given conditions and the conclusion. The hypothesis is that n² aₙ converges. So, that means as n approaches infinity, n² aₙ approaches some limit, say L. Therefore, aₙ must be behaving like L / n² for large n. So, aₙ is O(1/n²). Which would imply that the series ∑ aₙ converges absolutely, since the sum of 1/n² converges.

Then, the conclusion is that there exists a subsequence of xₙ = sin(n)/n such that the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges. So, xₙ itself is sin(n)/n, which is a bounded sequence because |sin(n)| ≤ 1, so |xₙ| ≤ 1/n. Then, the terms xₙ are O(1/n), and the series ∑ xₙ is conditionally convergent (since ∑ sin(n)/n converges conditionally by Dirichlet&#x27;s test, but not absolutely because ∑ 1/n diverges).

But here we&#x27;re allowed to take a subsequence of xₙ, so x_{n_k} = sin(n_k)/n_k, and sum over k of sin(n_k)/n_k * a_k. The question is whether such a subsequence exists so that this series converges.

Given that aₖ is O(1/k²), then each term x_{n_k} a_k is O(1/(n_k k²)). But since n_k is a subsequence, n_k ≥ k, right? Because in a subsequence, the indices are increasing. So n_k ≥ k for all k. Therefore, 1/(n_k k²) ≤ 1/k³. So then the terms x_{n_k} a_k are O(1/k³), and ∑ 1/k³ converges absolutely. Therefore, if we can bound |x_{n_k} a_k| ≤ C /k³ for some constant C, then the series would converge absolutely.

But wait, hold on. Is that the case? Let&#x27;s see. If aₖ is O(1/k²), then |aₖ| ≤ C /k² for some constant C. Also, |x_{n_k}| = |sin(n_k)/n_k| ≤ 1/n_k. Since n_k ≥ k, as I mentioned, then 1/n_k ≤ 1/k. Therefore, |x_{n_k} a_k| ≤ (1/n_k)(C /k²) ≤ C / (k^3). Therefore, the terms are bounded by C /k³, whose sum converges. Therefore, by the comparison test, the series ∑ |x_{n_k} a_k| converges, so the original series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges absolutely.

Wait, but does that mean that no matter what subsequence we pick, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges absolutely? But the problem is asking whether there exists a subsequence (x_{n_k}) such that the series converges. If what I just thought is correct, then actually for any subsequence (x_{n_k}), the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k would converge absolutely, because the terms are bounded by 1/k³. Therefore, the statement is trivially true? Because you can take any subsequence, and the series would converge.

But that seems too straightforward, so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me verify again. The key point is that aₖ is O(1/k²), and x_{n_k} is O(1/n_k). But since n_k ≥ k, then 1/n_k ≤ 1/k, so x_{n_k} a_k is O(1/k³). Hence, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k is dominated by a convergent series. Therefore, the conclusion holds for any subsequence. Therefore, the existence is trivial, because every subsequence would work. Therefore, the statement is true.

But wait, that can&#x27;t be right, because x_{n} is sin(n)/n, which is conditionally convergent. But here we&#x27;re summing x_{n_k} a_k, not x_{n_k}. Since a_k is summable (because it&#x27;s O(1/k²)), and x_{n_k} is bounded by 1/k, then the product is O(1/k³). Therefore, regardless of the signs or oscillations, the series converges absolutely. Therefore, regardless of the choice of subsequence, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges absolutely. Therefore, the answer is true, because such a subsequence exists—in fact, all subsequences work.

But wait, let me test with an example. Let&#x27;s suppose that aₖ = 1/k². Then, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k would be ∑ sin(n_k)/(n_k k²). Since |sin(n_k)| ≤ 1, then |sin(n_k)/(n_k k²)| ≤ 1/(n_k k²) ≤ 1/k³, as before. Therefore, the series converges absolutely. Therefore, regardless of how we choose the subsequence n_k, we have absolute convergence.

Hence, the answer should be True. But wait, let me check if there is a possible loophole here.

Wait, the problem states that (n² aₙ) is convergent. So, maybe the limit is not necessarily zero? Wait, no. If n² aₙ converges, then its limit must exist. Let&#x27;s denote the limit as L. Then, if L ≠ 0, then aₙ ~ L /n², so aₙ is asymptotically L/n². If L = 0, then aₙ is o(1/n²). But in either case, aₙ is O(1/n²), so the same reasoning applies. Therefore, |aₖ| ≤ C /k² for some C, and hence |x_{n_k} aₖ| ≤ C / (n_k k²) ≤ C /k³, so the series converges absolutely. Therefore, regardless of the subsequence, the series converges.

Therefore, the statement is actually stronger: not only does there exist a subsequence, but in fact every subsequence would work. Therefore, the answer is True.

Wait, but maybe I&#x27;m missing something here. Let me consider if aₖ could be negative or have varying signs. However, even if aₖ has varying signs, the absolute convergence would still hold because |x_{n_k} aₖ| is still bounded by C /k³. Therefore, regardless of the signs, the series ∑ x_{n_k} aₖ converges absolutely. So even if aₖ is signed, since we are multiplying by another term x_{n_k} which is also bounded, the absolute convergence is maintained.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the statement is True, because any subsequence of xₙ would result in the series ∑ x_{n_k} aₖ being absolutely convergent, given that aₖ is O(1/k²). Hence, such a subsequence exists (in fact, all of them do), so the statement is true.

But wait, let me check again. The problem says &quot;there exists a subsequence (x_{n_k})&quot; so that the series converges. Since all subsequences work, then certainly at least one exists. Therefore, the statement is true.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me, but in this case, the reasoning seems solid. Because the key point is that the product x_{n_k} aₖ is O(1/k³), so regardless of the choice of subsequence, the series converges. Therefore, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{True}

Given that \((n^2 a_n)\) is a convergent sequence, we know that \(a_n\) must be \(O(1/n^2)\). This implies that the series \(\sum a_n\) converges absolutely. 

We need to determine if there exists a subsequence \((x_{n_k})\) of \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\) such that the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges. 

Since \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\), we have \(|x_n| \leq \frac{1}{n}\). For any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\), the terms \(|x_{n_k}| \leq \frac{1}{n_k}\). Given that \(n_k \geq k\) for all \(k\), it follows that \(\frac{1}{n_k} \leq \frac{1}{k}\). 

Given \(a_k\) is \(O(1/k^2)\), we have \(|a_k| \leq \frac{C}{k^2}\) for some constant \(C\). Therefore, the product term \(|x_{n_k} a_k| \leq \frac{C}{n_k k^2} \leq \frac{C}{k^3}\). 

The series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\) is a convergent p-series with \(p = 3 &gt; 1\). By the comparison test, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} |x_{n_k} a_k|\) converges absolutely. Hence, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges absolutely for any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\).

Since any subsequence will work, there certainly exists such a subsequence. Therefore, the statement is true.

Given that \((n^2 a_n)\) is a convergent sequence, we know that \(a_n\) must be \(O(1/n^2)\). This implies that the series \(\sum a_n\) converges absolutely. 

We need to determine if there exists a subsequence \((x_{n_k})\) of \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\) such that the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges. 

Since \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\), we have \(|x_n| \leq \frac{1}{n}\). For any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\), the terms \(|x_{n_k}| \leq \frac{1}{n_k}\). Given that \(n_k \geq k\) for all \(k\), it follows that \(\frac{1}{n_k} \leq \frac{1}{k}\). 

Given \(a_k\) is \(O(1/k^2)\), we have \(|a_k| \leq \frac{C}{k^2}\) for some constant \(C\). Therefore, the product term \(|x_{n_k} a_k| \leq \frac{C}{n_k k^2} \leq \frac{C}{k^3}\). 

The series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\) is a convergent p-series with \(p = 3 &gt; 1\). By the comparison test, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} |x_{n_k} a_k|\) converges absolutely. Hence, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges absolutely for any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\).

Since any subsequence will work, there certainly exists such a subsequence. Therefore, the statement is true.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if this statement is true or false. Let me start by breaking it down. The statement says: If (n² aₙ) is a convergent sequence, then there exists a subsequence (x_{n_k}) of xₙ = sin(n)/n such that the series ∑_{k=1}^∞ x_{n_k} a_k converges.

First, let&#x27;s parse the given conditions and the conclusion. The hypothesis is that n² aₙ converges. So, that means as n approaches infinity, n² aₙ approaches some limit, say L. Therefore, aₙ must be behaving like L / n² for large n. So, aₙ is O(1/n²). Which would imply that the series ∑ aₙ converges absolutely, since the sum of 1/n² converges.

Then, the conclusion is that there exists a subsequence of xₙ = sin(n)/n such that the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges. So, xₙ itself is sin(n)/n, which is a bounded sequence because |sin(n)| ≤ 1, so |xₙ| ≤ 1/n. Then, the terms xₙ are O(1/n), and the series ∑ xₙ is conditionally convergent (since ∑ sin(n)/n converges conditionally by Dirichlet&#x27;s test, but not absolutely because ∑ 1/n diverges).

But here we&#x27;re allowed to take a subsequence of xₙ, so x_{n_k} = sin(n_k)/n_k, and sum over k of sin(n_k)/n_k * a_k. The question is whether such a subsequence exists so that this series converges.

Given that aₖ is O(1/k²), then each term x_{n_k} a_k is O(1/(n_k k²)). But since n_k is a subsequence, n_k ≥ k, right? Because in a subsequence, the indices are increasing. So n_k ≥ k for all k. Therefore, 1/(n_k k²) ≤ 1/k³. So then the terms x_{n_k} a_k are O(1/k³), and ∑ 1/k³ converges absolutely. Therefore, if we can bound |x_{n_k} a_k| ≤ C /k³ for some constant C, then the series would converge absolutely.

But wait, hold on. Is that the case? Let&#x27;s see. If aₖ is O(1/k²), then |aₖ| ≤ C /k² for some constant C. Also, |x_{n_k}| = |sin(n_k)/n_k| ≤ 1/n_k. Since n_k ≥ k, as I mentioned, then 1/n_k ≤ 1/k. Therefore, |x_{n_k} a_k| ≤ (1/n_k)(C /k²) ≤ C / (k^3). Therefore, the terms are bounded by C /k³, whose sum converges. Therefore, by the comparison test, the series ∑ |x_{n_k} a_k| converges, so the original series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges absolutely.

Wait, but does that mean that no matter what subsequence we pick, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges absolutely? But the problem is asking whether there exists a subsequence (x_{n_k}) such that the series converges. If what I just thought is correct, then actually for any subsequence (x_{n_k}), the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k would converge absolutely, because the terms are bounded by 1/k³. Therefore, the statement is trivially true? Because you can take any subsequence, and the series would converge.

But that seems too straightforward, so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me verify again. The key point is that aₖ is O(1/k²), and x_{n_k} is O(1/n_k). But since n_k ≥ k, then 1/n_k ≤ 1/k, so x_{n_k} a_k is O(1/k³). Hence, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k is dominated by a convergent series. Therefore, the conclusion holds for any subsequence. Therefore, the existence is trivial, because every subsequence would work. Therefore, the statement is true.

But wait, that can&#x27;t be right, because x_{n} is sin(n)/n, which is conditionally convergent. But here we&#x27;re summing x_{n_k} a_k, not x_{n_k}. Since a_k is summable (because it&#x27;s O(1/k²)), and x_{n_k} is bounded by 1/k, then the product is O(1/k³). Therefore, regardless of the signs or oscillations, the series converges absolutely. Therefore, regardless of the choice of subsequence, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges absolutely. Therefore, the answer is true, because such a subsequence exists—in fact, all subsequences work.

But wait, let me test with an example. Let&#x27;s suppose that aₖ = 1/k². Then, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k would be ∑ sin(n_k)/(n_k k²). Since |sin(n_k)| ≤ 1, then |sin(n_k)/(n_k k²)| ≤ 1/(n_k k²) ≤ 1/k³, as before. Therefore, the series converges absolutely. Therefore, regardless of how we choose the subsequence n_k, we have absolute convergence.

Hence, the answer should be True. But wait, let me check if there is a possible loophole here.

Wait, the problem states that (n² aₙ) is convergent. So, maybe the limit is not necessarily zero? Wait, no. If n² aₙ converges, then its limit must exist. Let&#x27;s denote the limit as L. Then, if L ≠ 0, then aₙ ~ L /n², so aₙ is asymptotically L/n². If L = 0, then aₙ is o(1/n²). But in either case, aₙ is O(1/n²), so the same reasoning applies. Therefore, |aₖ| ≤ C /k² for some C, and hence |x_{n_k} aₖ| ≤ C / (n_k k²) ≤ C /k³, so the series converges absolutely. Therefore, regardless of the subsequence, the series converges.

Therefore, the statement is actually stronger: not only does there exist a subsequence, but in fact every subsequence would work. Therefore, the answer is True.

Wait, but maybe I&#x27;m missing something here. Let me consider if aₖ could be negative or have varying signs. However, even if aₖ has varying signs, the absolute convergence would still hold because |x_{n_k} aₖ| is still bounded by C /k³. Therefore, regardless of the signs, the series ∑ x_{n_k} aₖ converges absolutely. So even if aₖ is signed, since we are multiplying by another term x_{n_k} which is also bounded, the absolute convergence is maintained.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the statement is True, because any subsequence of xₙ would result in the series ∑ x_{n_k} aₖ being absolutely convergent, given that aₖ is O(1/k²). Hence, such a subsequence exists (in fact, all of them do), so the statement is true.

But wait, let me check again. The problem says &quot;there exists a subsequence (x_{n_k})&quot; so that the series converges. Since all subsequences work, then certainly at least one exists. Therefore, the statement is true.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me, but in this case, the reasoning seems solid. Because the key point is that the product x_{n_k} aₖ is O(1/k³), so regardless of the choice of subsequence, the series converges. Therefore, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{True}

Given that \((n^2 a_n)\) is a convergent sequence, we know that \(a_n\) must be \(O(1/n^2)\). This implies that the series \(\sum a_n\) converges absolutely. 

We need to determine if there exists a subsequence \((x_{n_k})\) of \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\) such that the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges. 

Since \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\), we have \(|x_n| \leq \frac{1}{n}\). For any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\), the terms \(|x_{n_k}| \leq \frac{1}{n_k}\). Given that \(n_k \geq k\) for all \(k\), it follows that \(\frac{1}{n_k} \leq \frac{1}{k}\). 

Given \(a_k\) is \(O(1/k^2)\), we have \(|a_k| \leq \frac{C}{k^2}\) for some constant \(C\). Therefore, the product term \(|x_{n_k} a_k| \leq \frac{C}{n_k k^2} \leq \frac{C}{k^3}\). 

The series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\) is a convergent p-series with \(p = 3 &gt; 1\). By the comparison test, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} |x_{n_k} a_k|\) converges absolutely. Hence, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges absolutely for any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\).

Since any subsequence will work, there certainly exists such a subsequence. Therefore, the statement is true.

Given that \((n^2 a_n)\) is a convergent sequence, we know that \(a_n\) must be \(O(1/n^2)\). This implies that the series \(\sum a_n\) converges absolutely. 

We need to determine if there exists a subsequence \((x_{n_k})\) of \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\) such that the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges. 

Since \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\), we have \(|x_n| \leq \frac{1}{n}\). For any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\), the terms \(|x_{n_k}| \leq \frac{1}{n_k}\). Given that \(n_k \geq k\) for all \(k\), it follows that \(\frac{1}{n_k} \leq \frac{1}{k}\). 

Given \(a_k\) is \(O(1/k^2)\), we have \(|a_k| \leq \frac{C}{k^2}\) for some constant \(C\). Therefore, the product term \(|x_{n_k} a_k| \leq \frac{C}{n_k k^2} \leq \frac{C}{k^3}\). 

The series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\) is a convergent p-series with \(p = 3 &gt; 1\). By the comparison test, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} |x_{n_k} a_k|\) converges absolutely. Hence, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges absolutely for any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\).

Since any subsequence will work, there certainly exists such a subsequence. Therefore, the statement is true.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if this statement is true or false. Let me start by breaking it down. The statement says: If (n² aₙ) is a convergent sequence, then there exists a subsequence (x_{n_k}) of xₙ = sin(n)/n such that the series ∑_{k=1}^∞ x_{n_k} a_k converges.

First, let&#x27;s parse the given conditions and the conclusion. The hypothesis is that n² aₙ converges. So, that means as n approaches infinity, n² aₙ approaches some limit, say L. Therefore, aₙ must be behaving like L / n² for large n. So, aₙ is O(1/n²). Which would imply that the series ∑ aₙ converges absolutely, since the sum of 1/n² converges.

Then, the conclusion is that there exists a subsequence of xₙ = sin(n)/n such that the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges. So, xₙ itself is sin(n)/n, which is a bounded sequence because |sin(n)| ≤ 1, so |xₙ| ≤ 1/n. Then, the terms xₙ are O(1/n), and the series ∑ xₙ is conditionally convergent (since ∑ sin(n)/n converges conditionally by Dirichlet&#x27;s test, but not absolutely because ∑ 1/n diverges).

But here we&#x27;re allowed to take a subsequence of xₙ, so x_{n_k} = sin(n_k)/n_k, and sum over k of sin(n_k)/n_k * a_k. The question is whether such a subsequence exists so that this series converges.

Given that aₖ is O(1/k²), then each term x_{n_k} a_k is O(1/(n_k k²)). But since n_k is a subsequence, n_k ≥ k, right? Because in a subsequence, the indices are increasing. So n_k ≥ k for all k. Therefore, 1/(n_k k²) ≤ 1/k³. So then the terms x_{n_k} a_k are O(1/k³), and ∑ 1/k³ converges absolutely. Therefore, if we can bound |x_{n_k} a_k| ≤ C /k³ for some constant C, then the series would converge absolutely.

But wait, hold on. Is that the case? Let&#x27;s see. If aₖ is O(1/k²), then |aₖ| ≤ C /k² for some constant C. Also, |x_{n_k}| = |sin(n_k)/n_k| ≤ 1/n_k. Since n_k ≥ k, as I mentioned, then 1/n_k ≤ 1/k. Therefore, |x_{n_k} a_k| ≤ (1/n_k)(C /k²) ≤ C / (k^3). Therefore, the terms are bounded by C /k³, whose sum converges. Therefore, by the comparison test, the series ∑ |x_{n_k} a_k| converges, so the original series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges absolutely.

Wait, but does that mean that no matter what subsequence we pick, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges absolutely? But the problem is asking whether there exists a subsequence (x_{n_k}) such that the series converges. If what I just thought is correct, then actually for any subsequence (x_{n_k}), the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k would converge absolutely, because the terms are bounded by 1/k³. Therefore, the statement is trivially true? Because you can take any subsequence, and the series would converge.

But that seems too straightforward, so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me verify again. The key point is that aₖ is O(1/k²), and x_{n_k} is O(1/n_k). But since n_k ≥ k, then 1/n_k ≤ 1/k, so x_{n_k} a_k is O(1/k³). Hence, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k is dominated by a convergent series. Therefore, the conclusion holds for any subsequence. Therefore, the existence is trivial, because every subsequence would work. Therefore, the statement is true.

But wait, that can&#x27;t be right, because x_{n} is sin(n)/n, which is conditionally convergent. But here we&#x27;re summing x_{n_k} a_k, not x_{n_k}. Since a_k is summable (because it&#x27;s O(1/k²)), and x_{n_k} is bounded by 1/k, then the product is O(1/k³). Therefore, regardless of the signs or oscillations, the series converges absolutely. Therefore, regardless of the choice of subsequence, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges absolutely. Therefore, the answer is true, because such a subsequence exists—in fact, all subsequences work.

But wait, let me test with an example. Let&#x27;s suppose that aₖ = 1/k². Then, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k would be ∑ sin(n_k)/(n_k k²). Since |sin(n_k)| ≤ 1, then |sin(n_k)/(n_k k²)| ≤ 1/(n_k k²) ≤ 1/k³, as before. Therefore, the series converges absolutely. Therefore, regardless of how we choose the subsequence n_k, we have absolute convergence.

Hence, the answer should be True. But wait, let me check if there is a possible loophole here.

Wait, the problem states that (n² aₙ) is convergent. So, maybe the limit is not necessarily zero? Wait, no. If n² aₙ converges, then its limit must exist. Let&#x27;s denote the limit as L. Then, if L ≠ 0, then aₙ ~ L /n², so aₙ is asymptotically L/n². If L = 0, then aₙ is o(1/n²). But in either case, aₙ is O(1/n²), so the same reasoning applies. Therefore, |aₖ| ≤ C /k² for some C, and hence |x_{n_k} aₖ| ≤ C / (n_k k²) ≤ C /k³, so the series converges absolutely. Therefore, regardless of the subsequence, the series converges.

Therefore, the statement is actually stronger: not only does there exist a subsequence, but in fact every subsequence would work. Therefore, the answer is True.

Wait, but maybe I&#x27;m missing something here. Let me consider if aₖ could be negative or have varying signs. However, even if aₖ has varying signs, the absolute convergence would still hold because |x_{n_k} aₖ| is still bounded by C /k³. Therefore, regardless of the signs, the series ∑ x_{n_k} aₖ converges absolutely. So even if aₖ is signed, since we are multiplying by another term x_{n_k} which is also bounded, the absolute convergence is maintained.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the statement is True, because any subsequence of xₙ would result in the series ∑ x_{n_k} aₖ being absolutely convergent, given that aₖ is O(1/k²). Hence, such a subsequence exists (in fact, all of them do), so the statement is true.

But wait, let me check again. The problem says &quot;there exists a subsequence (x_{n_k})&quot; so that the series converges. Since all subsequences work, then certainly at least one exists. Therefore, the statement is true.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me, but in this case, the reasoning seems solid. Because the key point is that the product x_{n_k} aₖ is O(1/k³), so regardless of the choice of subsequence, the series converges. Therefore, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{True}

Given that \((n^2 a_n)\) is a convergent sequence, we know that \(a_n\) must be \(O(1/n^2)\). This implies that the series \(\sum a_n\) converges absolutely. 

We need to determine if there exists a subsequence \((x_{n_k})\) of \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\) such that the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges. 

Since \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\), we have \(|x_n| \leq \frac{1}{n}\). For any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\), the terms \(|x_{n_k}| \leq \frac{1}{n_k}\). Given that \(n_k \geq k\) for all \(k\), it follows that \(\frac{1}{n_k} \leq \frac{1}{k}\). 

Given \(a_k\) is \(O(1/k^2)\), we have \(|a_k| \leq \frac{C}{k^2}\) for some constant \(C\). Therefore, the product term \(|x_{n_k} a_k| \leq \frac{C}{n_k k^2} \leq \frac{C}{k^3}\). 

The series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\) is a convergent p-series with \(p = 3 &gt; 1\). By the comparison test, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} |x_{n_k} a_k|\) converges absolutely. Hence, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges absolutely for any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\).

Since any subsequence will work, there certainly exists such a subsequence. Therefore, the statement is true.

Given that \((n^2 a_n)\) is a convergent sequence, we know that \(a_n\) must be \(O(1/n^2)\). This implies that the series \(\sum a_n\) converges absolutely. 

We need to determine if there exists a subsequence \((x_{n_k})\) of \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\) such that the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges. 

Since \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\), we have \(|x_n| \leq \frac{1}{n}\). For any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\), the terms \(|x_{n_k}| \leq \frac{1}{n_k}\). Given that \(n_k \geq k\) for all \(k\), it follows that \(\frac{1}{n_k} \leq \frac{1}{k}\). 

Given \(a_k\) is \(O(1/k^2)\), we have \(|a_k| \leq \frac{C}{k^2}\) for some constant \(C\). Therefore, the product term \(|x_{n_k} a_k| \leq \frac{C}{n_k k^2} \leq \frac{C}{k^3}\). 

The series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\) is a convergent p-series with \(p = 3 &gt; 1\). By the comparison test, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} |x_{n_k} a_k|\) converges absolutely. Hence, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges absolutely for any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\).

Since any subsequence will work, there certainly exists such a subsequence. Therefore, the statement is true.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if this statement is true or false. Let me start by breaking it down. The statement says: If (n² aₙ) is a convergent sequence, then there exists a subsequence (x_{n_k}) of xₙ = sin(n)/n such that the series ∑_{k=1}^∞ x_{n_k} a_k converges.

First, let&#x27;s parse the given conditions and the conclusion. The hypothesis is that n² aₙ converges. So, that means as n approaches infinity, n² aₙ approaches some limit, say L. Therefore, aₙ must be behaving like L / n² for large n. So, aₙ is O(1/n²). Which would imply that the series ∑ aₙ converges absolutely, since the sum of 1/n² converges.

Then, the conclusion is that there exists a subsequence of xₙ = sin(n)/n such that the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges. So, xₙ itself is sin(n)/n, which is a bounded sequence because |sin(n)| ≤ 1, so |xₙ| ≤ 1/n. Then, the terms xₙ are O(1/n), and the series ∑ xₙ is conditionally convergent (since ∑ sin(n)/n converges conditionally by Dirichlet&#x27;s test, but not absolutely because ∑ 1/n diverges).

But here we&#x27;re allowed to take a subsequence of xₙ, so x_{n_k} = sin(n_k)/n_k, and sum over k of sin(n_k)/n_k * a_k. The question is whether such a subsequence exists so that this series converges.

Given that aₖ is O(1/k²), then each term x_{n_k} a_k is O(1/(n_k k²)). But since n_k is a subsequence, n_k ≥ k, right? Because in a subsequence, the indices are increasing. So n_k ≥ k for all k. Therefore, 1/(n_k k²) ≤ 1/k³. So then the terms x_{n_k} a_k are O(1/k³), and ∑ 1/k³ converges absolutely. Therefore, if we can bound |x_{n_k} a_k| ≤ C /k³ for some constant C, then the series would converge absolutely.

But wait, hold on. Is that the case? Let&#x27;s see. If aₖ is O(1/k²), then |aₖ| ≤ C /k² for some constant C. Also, |x_{n_k}| = |sin(n_k)/n_k| ≤ 1/n_k. Since n_k ≥ k, as I mentioned, then 1/n_k ≤ 1/k. Therefore, |x_{n_k} a_k| ≤ (1/n_k)(C /k²) ≤ C / (k^3). Therefore, the terms are bounded by C /k³, whose sum converges. Therefore, by the comparison test, the series ∑ |x_{n_k} a_k| converges, so the original series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges absolutely.

Wait, but does that mean that no matter what subsequence we pick, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges absolutely? But the problem is asking whether there exists a subsequence (x_{n_k}) such that the series converges. If what I just thought is correct, then actually for any subsequence (x_{n_k}), the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k would converge absolutely, because the terms are bounded by 1/k³. Therefore, the statement is trivially true? Because you can take any subsequence, and the series would converge.

But that seems too straightforward, so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me verify again. The key point is that aₖ is O(1/k²), and x_{n_k} is O(1/n_k). But since n_k ≥ k, then 1/n_k ≤ 1/k, so x_{n_k} a_k is O(1/k³). Hence, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k is dominated by a convergent series. Therefore, the conclusion holds for any subsequence. Therefore, the existence is trivial, because every subsequence would work. Therefore, the statement is true.

But wait, that can&#x27;t be right, because x_{n} is sin(n)/n, which is conditionally convergent. But here we&#x27;re summing x_{n_k} a_k, not x_{n_k}. Since a_k is summable (because it&#x27;s O(1/k²)), and x_{n_k} is bounded by 1/k, then the product is O(1/k³). Therefore, regardless of the signs or oscillations, the series converges absolutely. Therefore, regardless of the choice of subsequence, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k converges absolutely. Therefore, the answer is true, because such a subsequence exists—in fact, all subsequences work.

But wait, let me test with an example. Let&#x27;s suppose that aₖ = 1/k². Then, the series ∑ x_{n_k} a_k would be ∑ sin(n_k)/(n_k k²). Since |sin(n_k)| ≤ 1, then |sin(n_k)/(n_k k²)| ≤ 1/(n_k k²) ≤ 1/k³, as before. Therefore, the series converges absolutely. Therefore, regardless of how we choose the subsequence n_k, we have absolute convergence.

Hence, the answer should be True. But wait, let me check if there is a possible loophole here.

Wait, the problem states that (n² aₙ) is convergent. So, maybe the limit is not necessarily zero? Wait, no. If n² aₙ converges, then its limit must exist. Let&#x27;s denote the limit as L. Then, if L ≠ 0, then aₙ ~ L /n², so aₙ is asymptotically L/n². If L = 0, then aₙ is o(1/n²). But in either case, aₙ is O(1/n²), so the same reasoning applies. Therefore, |aₖ| ≤ C /k² for some C, and hence |x_{n_k} aₖ| ≤ C / (n_k k²) ≤ C /k³, so the series converges absolutely. Therefore, regardless of the subsequence, the series converges.

Therefore, the statement is actually stronger: not only does there exist a subsequence, but in fact every subsequence would work. Therefore, the answer is True.

Wait, but maybe I&#x27;m missing something here. Let me consider if aₖ could be negative or have varying signs. However, even if aₖ has varying signs, the absolute convergence would still hold because |x_{n_k} aₖ| is still bounded by C /k³. Therefore, regardless of the signs, the series ∑ x_{n_k} aₖ converges absolutely. So even if aₖ is signed, since we are multiplying by another term x_{n_k} which is also bounded, the absolute convergence is maintained.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the statement is True, because any subsequence of xₙ would result in the series ∑ x_{n_k} aₖ being absolutely convergent, given that aₖ is O(1/k²). Hence, such a subsequence exists (in fact, all of them do), so the statement is true.

But wait, let me check again. The problem says &quot;there exists a subsequence (x_{n_k})&quot; so that the series converges. Since all subsequences work, then certainly at least one exists. Therefore, the statement is true.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me, but in this case, the reasoning seems solid. Because the key point is that the product x_{n_k} aₖ is O(1/k³), so regardless of the choice of subsequence, the series converges. Therefore, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{True}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given that \((n^2 a_n)\) is a convergent sequence, we know that \(a_n\) must be \(O(1/n^2)\). This implies that the series \(\sum a_n\) converges absolutely. 

We need to determine if there exists a subsequence \((x_{n_k})\) of \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\) such that the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges. 

Since \(x_n = \frac{\sin(n)}{n}\), we have \(|x_n| \leq \frac{1}{n}\). For any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\), the terms \(|x_{n_k}| \leq \frac{1}{n_k}\). Given that \(n_k \geq k\) for all \(k\), it follows that \(\frac{1}{n_k} \leq \frac{1}{k}\). 

Given \(a_k\) is \(O(1/k^2)\), we have \(|a_k| \leq \frac{C}{k^2}\) for some constant \(C\). Therefore, the product term \(|x_{n_k} a_k| \leq \frac{C}{n_k k^2} \leq \frac{C}{k^3}\). 

The series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^3}\) is a convergent p-series with \(p = 3 &gt; 1\). By the comparison test, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} |x_{n_k} a_k|\) converges absolutely. Hence, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{n_k} a_k\) converges absolutely for any subsequence \((x_{n_k})\).

Since any subsequence will work, there certainly exists such a subsequence. Therefore, the statement is true.

Reference Answer: We make the substitution $y = \left(\frac{x}{x+1}\right)^2$ to simplify the equation, so that \[\frac{y+11}{y+1} = 2.\]Multiplying by $y+1$ gives $y+11 = 2y+2,$ so $y=9.$ Therefore, we have \[\frac{x}{x+1} = \pm 3.\]Then, either $x = 3(x+1)$ or $x = -3(x+1).$ These give solutions $x =\boxed{ -\tfrac32}$ and $x = \boxed{-\tfrac34},$ respectively.          </p>
