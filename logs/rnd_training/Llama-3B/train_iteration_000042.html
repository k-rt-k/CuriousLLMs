Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the Petersen graph can be a counterexample to the statement that &quot;Every graph G without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 subgraph is planar.&quot; Hmm. Let&#x27;s break this down step by step.

First, let me recall some basics. A planar graph is one that can be drawn on the plane without any edges crossing. Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem tells us that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K_5 (the complete graph on five vertices) or K_{3,3} (the complete bipartite graph on six vertices, split into two sets of three). However, the question here is about induced subgraphs, not subdivisions. So the original assertion is saying that if a graph doesn&#x27;t have K_{3,3} or K_5 as an induced subgraph, then it must be planar. If the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have these as induced subgraphs but is itself non-planar, then it would be a counterexample.

Alright, so let me recall the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s a well-known non-planar graph. I remember that it doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but wait, does it contain them as induced subgraphs? That&#x27;s the key here. The original assertion is about induced subgraphs, so even if the Petersen graph had a K_{3,3} or K_5 as a subgraph but not induced, it wouldn&#x27;t matter. The question is specifically about induced ones.

Let me confirm. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges. It&#x27;s a cubic graph (each vertex has degree 3). K_5 has 10 edges and is a complete graph, so each vertex has degree 4. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, it can&#x27;t contain K_5 as a subgraph because you can&#x27;t have a vertex with degree 4 in a cubic graph. Similarly, K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph with each vertex of degree 3. So maybe K_{3,3} could be a subgraph? But again, the question is about induced subgraphs.

An induced subgraph is a subset of the vertices of a graph together with all the edges whose endpoints are both in this subset. So even if the Petersen graph has a subgraph isomorphic to K_{3,3}, unless all the edges present in K_{3,3} between those vertices are also present in the Petersen graph, it&#x27;s not an induced subgraph.

Let me check if the Petersen graph contains an induced K_{3,3}. The Petersen graph is known to be non-planar, but according to Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem, it must contain a subdivision of K_5 or K_{3,3}. Indeed, the Petersen graph is a famous example of a non-planar graph that doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but it does contain a subdivision of K_{3,3}. However, a subdivision is different from an induced subgraph. Subdividing edges adds new vertices on the edges, so a subdivided K_{3,3} would not be an induced subgraph because the original edges are split into paths.

Therefore, the Petersen graph itself is non-planar, but does it contain an induced K_5 or K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s check K_5 first. As mentioned, all vertices in the Petersen graph have degree 3, but in K_5, every vertex has degree 4. So even if you take any 5 vertices in the Petersen graph, they can&#x27;t form a K_5 because the degrees are insufficient. So, there&#x27;s no induced K_5.

What about K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s see. K_{3,3} is bipartite, with two partitions each containing three vertices, and every vertex in one partition connected to every vertex in the other. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex has degree 3. If there was an induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph, each vertex in one partition would need to be connected to all three vertices in the other partition. But since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex can only have three edges. However, in K_{3,3}, each vertex is connected to three vertices in the opposite partition. So, if a vertex in the induced subgraph is part of the K_{3,3}, all its neighbors in the Petersen graph must be within the K_{3,3} as well. But in the Petersen graph, the neighborhoods are structured such that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let me try to visualize the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s usually drawn as a pentagon connected to a pentagram, with each vertex of the pentagon connected to a corresponding vertex of the pentagram. Each vertex is connected to three others: two in its own pentagon/pentagram and one in the other.

Suppose we try to find an induced K_{3,3}. Let&#x27;s take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices and one outer vertex. If we pick three outer vertices and three inner ones, perhaps we can form a bipartition. However, in the Petersen graph, each outer vertex is connected to only one inner vertex, and each inner vertex is connected to only one outer vertex. So, for example, if we take three outer vertices and their corresponding three inner vertices (each connected by a spoke), the edges between the outer and inner vertices would only be the three spokes. But in K_{3,3}, every outer vertex must connect to every inner vertex. In this case, each outer vertex is only connected to one inner vertex, so that&#x27;s only three edges between the partitions, whereas K_{3,3} would require nine edges (3x3). So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Alternatively, maybe if we select different sets of three vertices. Let me think. Since the Petersen graph is symmetric, any selection of six vertices should be similar. Suppose we try to find a bipartite induced subgraph with partitions of size three and three. The problem is that in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let&#x27;s say we pick three vertices from one partition. Each needs to be connected to all three in the other partition. But given the structure of the Petersen graph, each vertex is only connected to three others. If a vertex is in one partition, to connect to all three in the other partition, that would require three edges. But if the other partition has three vertices, each of those would need to connect back to all three in the first partition. However, each vertex in the other partition is already connected to two others in their own partition (if they are on the pentagon or pentagram) and one in the opposite. So they can&#x27;t have three edges to the first partition. Hence, it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph.

Therefore, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as an induced subgraph. Thus, it would serve as a counterexample to the assertion that every graph without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 is planar.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in reasoning about K_{3,3}. Let me try to see if there is a subset of six vertices in the Petersen graph that induce a K_{3,3}. Take the Petersen graph and label the outer pentagon vertices as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 and the inner pentagram vertices as u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, where each ui is connected to vi. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices (in the pentagram) and one outer vertex. So, suppose we take three outer vertices, say v1, v2, v3, and three inner vertices, say u4, u5, u1. Wait, u1 is connected to v1. Let&#x27;s see. The connections between the outer and inner vertices are only the spokes, so v1 is connected to u1, v2 to u2, etc. If we take v1, v2, v3 from the outer and u4, u5, u1 from the inner, then v1 is connected to u1, v2 is connected to u2 (which is not in the set), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set). So, in this subset, the only edges between the outer and inner are v1-u1. The rest of the edges would be the outer edges (v1-v2, v2-v3, v3-v4, etc.), but since we took only v1, v2, v3, the outer edges are v1-v2, v2-v3. The inner vertices u4, u5, u1: in the inner pentagram, u4 is connected to u5 and u3, but u3 isn&#x27;t in the set. u5 is connected to u4 and u1. u1 is connected to u5 and u2 (which isn&#x27;t in the set). So within the inner subset, u4 is connected to u5, u5 is connected to u1, and u1 is connected to no one else in the inner subset. So the induced subgraph on these six vertices would have edges: between outer vertices: v1-v2, v2-v3; between inner vertices: u4-u5, u5-u1; and the spoke edge v1-u1. That&#x27;s nothing like K_{3,3}; it&#x27;s missing almost all the edges.

Alternatively, pick six vertices in some other way. Maybe three from the outer and three from the inner, but not corresponding. For example, take v1, v3, v5 from the outer and u2, u4, u5 from the inner. Let&#x27;s check edges. The outer edges: v1 connected to v2 and v5 (but v2 and v5 are not in the set), so v1 only connected to v5. Wait, no, in the outer pentagon, v1 is connected to v2 and v5. But if we take v1, v3, v5, then v1 is connected to v5 (since they&#x27;re adjacent on the pentagon), v3 is connected to v4 and v2 (neither in the set), and v5 is connected to v1 and v4 (not in the set). So the outer subset has edges v1-v5. The inner subset u2, u4, u5: u2 is connected to u1 and u3 (not in the set), u4 is connected to u3 and u5, u5 is connected to u4 and u1 (not in the set). So u4-u5 is an edge. Between the outer and inner: v1 connected to u1 (not in the inner subset), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set), v5 connected to u5. So only v5-u5 is an edge. So the induced subgraph has edges v1-v5, u4-u5, and v5-u5. That&#x27;s just a triangle? Wait, no. v1 is connected to v5, v5 is connected to u5, and u5 is connected to u4. So it&#x27;s a path of three edges. Not K_{3,3}.

Hmm. Maybe trying different combinations. Alternatively, maybe pick vertices not all from outer and inner. Wait, but the Petersen graph is symmetric, so it shouldn&#x27;t matter. But perhaps if I pick vertices that form a 6-cycle or something. Wait, the Petersen graph has girth 5, so there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So any induced subgraph with a 6-cycle would have to be a hexagon, but the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have a 6-cycle. Wait, actually, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5 and 6? Wait, no, the girth is 5, meaning the shortest cycle is 5. So any cycle of length 6 would have to be a longer cycle. Wait, but can you even get a 6-cycle in the Petersen graph?

Wait, let me check. In the standard Petersen graph, if you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. The inner pentagram is also a 5-cycle. If you traverse the spokes, you can get longer cycles. For example, starting at v1, go to u1, then to u2, then to v2, then to v3, then to u3, then to u4, then to v4, etc. But I think the cycles are either of length 5 or longer. But does it have a 6-cycle? Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1, go to v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, back to v1. Wait, is that a cycle? v1 to v2 (outer edge), v2 to v3 (outer edge), v3 to u3 (spoke), u3 to u4 (inner edge), u4 to v4 (spoke), v4 to v1 (outer edge). That&#x27;s a 6-cycle: v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1. But wait, does this form a cycle? Let&#x27;s check the connections:

v1 adjacent to v2: yes.

v2 adjacent to v3: yes.

v3 adjacent to u3: yes.

u3 adjacent to u4: in the inner pentagon, u3 is adjacent to u4 and u2, yes.

u4 adjacent to v4: yes.

v4 adjacent to v1: yes, if in the outer pentagon, v4 is adjacent to v5 and v3. Wait, no. Wait, the outer pentagon is v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, with each adjacent to the next. So v4 is adjacent to v3 and v5. So v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, the path v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1 is not a cycle because v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, that&#x27;s a 6-vertex path, but not a cycle.

Hmm. So maybe there&#x27;s no 6-cycle in the Petersen graph. Wait, but according to some references, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5, 6, 8, and 9, but I need to confirm. Let me think. If you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. If you take the inner pentagram, that&#x27;s another 5-cycle. For a 6-cycle, maybe traverse spokes and inner edges. For example: v1, u1, u2, v2, v3, u3, v1. Wait, but that would be v1 connected to u1, u1 connected to u2, u2 connected to v2, v2 connected to v3, v3 connected to u3, u3 connected to v1? Wait, u3 is not connected to v1. So that doesn&#x27;t form a cycle. Alternatively, v1, u1, u5, v5, v4, u4, v1. Let&#x27;s check: v1-u1, u1-u5 (inner edge), u5-v5, v5-v4, v4-u4, u4 connected to v1? No, u4 is connected to v4 and u3. So no. So maybe that&#x27;s not a cycle.

Alternatively, maybe another path. Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1: v1, v2, u2, u3, v3, v4, v1. But v4 is not connected to v1. Hmm. Maybe it&#x27;s not possible. Wait, actually, according to the properties of the Petersen graph, it is a 3-regular graph with girth 5, so the shortest cycle is 5, and it doesn&#x27;t have cycles of length 3 or 4. So perhaps there are cycles of length 6, but they are not induced cycles. Because an induced cycle would require that there are no chords, but in a 6-cycle, if there are chords, it&#x27;s not induced. Given that the Petersen graph is 3-regular, adding chords might complicate things. But since the girth is 5, there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So, a 6-cycle would have to be chordless, which would make it an induced cycle. But does such a cycle exist?

Wait, in the Petersen graph, can we find a 6-cycle? Let me check online in my mind. I recall that the Petersen graph does have cycles of length 6, but they are not induced. Wait, if the girth is 5, then any 6-cycle must have a chord, making it non-induced. Therefore, there are no induced 6-cycles. Therefore, any 6-vertex induced subgraph cannot be a cycle. So, perhaps the induced subgraphs on six vertices in the Petersen graph are not bipartite. But K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph. So, if the induced subgraph is not bipartite, it can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. Alternatively, even if it&#x27;s bipartite, it needs to be complete.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s take a different approach. Let&#x27;s check all possible 6-vertex induced subgraphs of the Petersen graph. Since the Petersen graph is small, maybe this is feasible. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices, so the number of 6-vertex induced subgraphs is C(10,6) = 210. That&#x27;s a lot, but maybe we can reason about their properties.

In an induced subgraph of six vertices, each vertex can have degree at most 3 (since the original graph is 3-regular). For it to be K_{3,3}, each vertex in one partition must have degree 3, connected to all three vertices in the other partition. So in total, each partition has three vertices, and all 9 edges are present between them. But in the induced subgraph, we need to have exactly those edges and no others.

But in the Petersen graph, any two adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Wait, no. Wait, in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. That&#x27;s a key property. Let me confirm. In the Petersen graph, if two vertices are non-adjacent, they have exactly one common neighbor. If they are adjacent, they have no common neighbors. Because it&#x27;s a strongly regular graph with parameters (10,3,0,1), which means each pair of adjacent vertices has 0 common neighbors, and each pair of non-adjacent vertices has 1 common neighbor.

Therefore, in the induced subgraph, if two vertices are adjacent in the Petersen graph, they have no common neighbors in the entire graph, so also in the induced subgraph. If two vertices are non-adjacent in the induced subgraph, they could be adjacent or non-adjacent in the whole graph. But if they are non-adjacent in the whole graph, they have one common neighbor in the whole graph, but that common neighbor might not be in the induced subgraph.

But let&#x27;s consider trying to form K_{3,3}. Suppose we have partitions A and B, each with three vertices. In K_{3,3}, every vertex in A is connected to every vertex in B, and there are no edges within A or within B. So in the induced subgraph, there should be no edges within A or within B, and all edges between A and B.

But in the Petersen graph, edges are arranged such that the outer pentagon and inner pentagram each have their own edges. Let&#x27;s think of the standard drawing. If we pick three vertices from the outer pentagon, they form a path or something. Each is connected to two others in the pentagon. So if we include three outer vertices, they have edges among themselves, which would violate the requirement of K_{3,3} having no edges within a partition. Similarly, three inner vertices would have edges among themselves. Therefore, if we pick three from the outer and three from the inner, the induced subgraph would have edges within the outer three, edges within the inner three, and some edges between them. But K_{3,3} has no edges within partitions. Therefore, such a subgraph would have extra edges, so it wouldn&#x27;t be a K_{3,3}.

Alternatively, maybe pick six vertices not split as three outer and three inner. But the Petersen graph is symmetric, so any six vertices would have a similar structure. Wait, but how else can you partition six vertices? Maybe two from outer, two from inner, and two others? But since the graph is symmetric, perhaps the induced subgraphs would still have edges within their groups.

Alternatively, consider another approach: the complement of the Petersen graph. But maybe that&#x27;s not helpful here.

Wait, another property: K_{3,3} has nine edges. The induced subgraph would need to have nine edges. Let&#x27;s calculate the number of edges in a 6-vertex induced subgraph of the Petersen graph. Each vertex has degree 3, but when you take an induced subgraph, each vertex can have degree between 0 and 3. The total number of edges in the induced subgraph can be calculated by summing the degrees and dividing by 2, but since we&#x27;re dealing with induced subgraphs, it&#x27;s just the number of edges present between those six vertices.

But how many edges can there be? Let&#x27;s see. In the entire Petersen graph, there are 15 edges. If we take six vertices, the maximum number of edges they can have is C(6,2) = 15, but obviously, the induced subgraph will have fewer since the Petersen graph isn&#x27;t complete. Given the regularity and structure, how many edges would a 6-vertex induced subgraph have?

Alternatively, since each vertex has degree 3, in the induced subgraph, each vertex can have at most 3 edges. But since the graph is 3-regular, each vertex has 3 edges in the whole graph. So in the induced subgraph, the degree of a vertex is the number of its neighbors that are also in the subgraph. So the number of edges in the induced subgraph would be half the sum of the degrees of the vertices within the subgraph. Since each vertex can contribute 0 to 3 edges, the total number of edges could be up to (6*3)/2 = 9, which is the number of edges in K_{3,3}. But is there an induced subgraph with 9 edges?

For that, each vertex in the subgraph would need to have degree 3 in the subgraph. But since the original graph is 3-regular, if a vertex has all three neighbors inside the subgraph, then it contributes 3 to the sum. If a vertex has, say, two neighbors inside the subgraph, it contributes 2, etc.

So to have 9 edges, the sum of degrees must be 18, but since each edge is counted twice, 9 edges correspond to sum of degrees 18. Therefore, each of the six vertices must have degree 3 in the induced subgraph, meaning each vertex is connected to all three others in the subgraph. But that would mean the induced subgraph is a 3-regular graph on six vertices. However, the only 3-regular graph on six vertices is the complete bipartite graph K_{3,3}, which is bipartite, and the complete tripartite graph... Wait, no. The 3-regular graphs on six vertices include K_{3,3} and the prism graph (two triangles connected by a matching), also known as the triangular prism, which is a 3-regular graph but not bipartite. So there are two 3-regular graphs on six vertices: K_{3,3} and the prism graph.

Therefore, if the induced subgraph is 3-regular, it could be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But in the Petersen graph, can we find an induced subgraph that&#x27;s 3-regular on six vertices? Let&#x27;s check.

If such a subgraph exists, it would need to be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But given the properties of the Petersen graph, like any two non-adjacent vertices having exactly one common neighbor, let&#x27;s see if a 3-regular induced subgraph is possible.

Suppose we have six vertices forming an induced subgraph. If it&#x27;s K_{3,3}, then it&#x27;s bipartite with partitions A and B. Each vertex in A is connected to all in B, and there are no edges within A or B. But in the Petersen graph, if we take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram, as before, they have edges within their own partitions. So that can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. If we take six vertices in some other configuration, perhaps?

Wait, the prism graph (two triangles connected by edges) is another 3-regular graph on six vertices. Let&#x27;s see if that exists as an induced subgraph in the Petersen graph. The prism graph has two triangles, each triangle being a 3-cycle. But the Petersen graph has girth 5, so it has no 3-cycles. Therefore, the prism graph cannot be a subgraph of the Petersen graph, induced or otherwise. Therefore, the only possible 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices would be K_{3,3}. But since the prism graph is excluded due to the girth, and K_{3,3} would require no edges within each partition, but any three vertices in the Petersen graph would have edges among themselves if they are from the outer or inner cycles.

Therefore, it&#x27;s impossible to have a 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices in the Petersen graph. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph. Thus, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph without induced K_5 or K_{3,3}, making it a counterexample to the original assertion.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample to refute the assertion that &quot;Every graph \( G \) without an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \) subgraph is planar,&quot; we need to check the following:

1. **Planarity of the Petersen Graph**: The Petersen graph is a well-known non-planar graph.
2. **Induced Subgraphs**: We need to verify if the Petersen graph contains an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \).

**Key Points**:
- The Petersen graph is non-planar.
- The Petersen graph is cubic (each vertex has degree 3), so it cannot contain \( K_5 \) as a subgraph (since \( K_5 \) requires each vertex to have degree 4).
- The Petersen graph does not contain \( K_{3,3} \) as an induced subgraph. This is because any induced subgraph of six vertices in the Petersen graph cannot be bipartite with all edges present between the two partitions (as required for \( K_{3,3} \)). The structure of the Petersen graph, with its girth of 5 and the property that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor, prevents the existence of such an induced subgraph.

**Conclusion**:
The Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \). Therefore, it serves as a counterexample to the given assertion.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the Petersen graph can be a counterexample to the statement that &quot;Every graph G without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 subgraph is planar.&quot; Hmm. Let&#x27;s break this down step by step.

First, let me recall some basics. A planar graph is one that can be drawn on the plane without any edges crossing. Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem tells us that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K_5 (the complete graph on five vertices) or K_{3,3} (the complete bipartite graph on six vertices, split into two sets of three). However, the question here is about induced subgraphs, not subdivisions. So the original assertion is saying that if a graph doesn&#x27;t have K_{3,3} or K_5 as an induced subgraph, then it must be planar. If the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have these as induced subgraphs but is itself non-planar, then it would be a counterexample.

Alright, so let me recall the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s a well-known non-planar graph. I remember that it doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but wait, does it contain them as induced subgraphs? That&#x27;s the key here. The original assertion is about induced subgraphs, so even if the Petersen graph had a K_{3,3} or K_5 as a subgraph but not induced, it wouldn&#x27;t matter. The question is specifically about induced ones.

Let me confirm. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges. It&#x27;s a cubic graph (each vertex has degree 3). K_5 has 10 edges and is a complete graph, so each vertex has degree 4. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, it can&#x27;t contain K_5 as a subgraph because you can&#x27;t have a vertex with degree 4 in a cubic graph. Similarly, K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph with each vertex of degree 3. So maybe K_{3,3} could be a subgraph? But again, the question is about induced subgraphs.

An induced subgraph is a subset of the vertices of a graph together with all the edges whose endpoints are both in this subset. So even if the Petersen graph has a subgraph isomorphic to K_{3,3}, unless all the edges present in K_{3,3} between those vertices are also present in the Petersen graph, it&#x27;s not an induced subgraph.

Let me check if the Petersen graph contains an induced K_{3,3}. The Petersen graph is known to be non-planar, but according to Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem, it must contain a subdivision of K_5 or K_{3,3}. Indeed, the Petersen graph is a famous example of a non-planar graph that doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but it does contain a subdivision of K_{3,3}. However, a subdivision is different from an induced subgraph. Subdividing edges adds new vertices on the edges, so a subdivided K_{3,3} would not be an induced subgraph because the original edges are split into paths.

Therefore, the Petersen graph itself is non-planar, but does it contain an induced K_5 or K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s check K_5 first. As mentioned, all vertices in the Petersen graph have degree 3, but in K_5, every vertex has degree 4. So even if you take any 5 vertices in the Petersen graph, they can&#x27;t form a K_5 because the degrees are insufficient. So, there&#x27;s no induced K_5.

What about K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s see. K_{3,3} is bipartite, with two partitions each containing three vertices, and every vertex in one partition connected to every vertex in the other. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex has degree 3. If there was an induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph, each vertex in one partition would need to be connected to all three vertices in the other partition. But since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex can only have three edges. However, in K_{3,3}, each vertex is connected to three vertices in the opposite partition. So, if a vertex in the induced subgraph is part of the K_{3,3}, all its neighbors in the Petersen graph must be within the K_{3,3} as well. But in the Petersen graph, the neighborhoods are structured such that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let me try to visualize the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s usually drawn as a pentagon connected to a pentagram, with each vertex of the pentagon connected to a corresponding vertex of the pentagram. Each vertex is connected to three others: two in its own pentagon/pentagram and one in the other.

Suppose we try to find an induced K_{3,3}. Let&#x27;s take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices and one outer vertex. If we pick three outer vertices and three inner ones, perhaps we can form a bipartition. However, in the Petersen graph, each outer vertex is connected to only one inner vertex, and each inner vertex is connected to only one outer vertex. So, for example, if we take three outer vertices and their corresponding three inner vertices (each connected by a spoke), the edges between the outer and inner vertices would only be the three spokes. But in K_{3,3}, every outer vertex must connect to every inner vertex. In this case, each outer vertex is only connected to one inner vertex, so that&#x27;s only three edges between the partitions, whereas K_{3,3} would require nine edges (3x3). So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Alternatively, maybe if we select different sets of three vertices. Let me think. Since the Petersen graph is symmetric, any selection of six vertices should be similar. Suppose we try to find a bipartite induced subgraph with partitions of size three and three. The problem is that in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let&#x27;s say we pick three vertices from one partition. Each needs to be connected to all three in the other partition. But given the structure of the Petersen graph, each vertex is only connected to three others. If a vertex is in one partition, to connect to all three in the other partition, that would require three edges. But if the other partition has three vertices, each of those would need to connect back to all three in the first partition. However, each vertex in the other partition is already connected to two others in their own partition (if they are on the pentagon or pentagram) and one in the opposite. So they can&#x27;t have three edges to the first partition. Hence, it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph.

Therefore, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as an induced subgraph. Thus, it would serve as a counterexample to the assertion that every graph without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 is planar.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in reasoning about K_{3,3}. Let me try to see if there is a subset of six vertices in the Petersen graph that induce a K_{3,3}. Take the Petersen graph and label the outer pentagon vertices as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 and the inner pentagram vertices as u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, where each ui is connected to vi. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices (in the pentagram) and one outer vertex. So, suppose we take three outer vertices, say v1, v2, v3, and three inner vertices, say u4, u5, u1. Wait, u1 is connected to v1. Let&#x27;s see. The connections between the outer and inner vertices are only the spokes, so v1 is connected to u1, v2 to u2, etc. If we take v1, v2, v3 from the outer and u4, u5, u1 from the inner, then v1 is connected to u1, v2 is connected to u2 (which is not in the set), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set). So, in this subset, the only edges between the outer and inner are v1-u1. The rest of the edges would be the outer edges (v1-v2, v2-v3, v3-v4, etc.), but since we took only v1, v2, v3, the outer edges are v1-v2, v2-v3. The inner vertices u4, u5, u1: in the inner pentagram, u4 is connected to u5 and u3, but u3 isn&#x27;t in the set. u5 is connected to u4 and u1. u1 is connected to u5 and u2 (which isn&#x27;t in the set). So within the inner subset, u4 is connected to u5, u5 is connected to u1, and u1 is connected to no one else in the inner subset. So the induced subgraph on these six vertices would have edges: between outer vertices: v1-v2, v2-v3; between inner vertices: u4-u5, u5-u1; and the spoke edge v1-u1. That&#x27;s nothing like K_{3,3}; it&#x27;s missing almost all the edges.

Alternatively, pick six vertices in some other way. Maybe three from the outer and three from the inner, but not corresponding. For example, take v1, v3, v5 from the outer and u2, u4, u5 from the inner. Let&#x27;s check edges. The outer edges: v1 connected to v2 and v5 (but v2 and v5 are not in the set), so v1 only connected to v5. Wait, no, in the outer pentagon, v1 is connected to v2 and v5. But if we take v1, v3, v5, then v1 is connected to v5 (since they&#x27;re adjacent on the pentagon), v3 is connected to v4 and v2 (neither in the set), and v5 is connected to v1 and v4 (not in the set). So the outer subset has edges v1-v5. The inner subset u2, u4, u5: u2 is connected to u1 and u3 (not in the set), u4 is connected to u3 and u5, u5 is connected to u4 and u1 (not in the set). So u4-u5 is an edge. Between the outer and inner: v1 connected to u1 (not in the inner subset), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set), v5 connected to u5. So only v5-u5 is an edge. So the induced subgraph has edges v1-v5, u4-u5, and v5-u5. That&#x27;s just a triangle? Wait, no. v1 is connected to v5, v5 is connected to u5, and u5 is connected to u4. So it&#x27;s a path of three edges. Not K_{3,3}.

Hmm. Maybe trying different combinations. Alternatively, maybe pick vertices not all from outer and inner. Wait, but the Petersen graph is symmetric, so it shouldn&#x27;t matter. But perhaps if I pick vertices that form a 6-cycle or something. Wait, the Petersen graph has girth 5, so there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So any induced subgraph with a 6-cycle would have to be a hexagon, but the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have a 6-cycle. Wait, actually, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5 and 6? Wait, no, the girth is 5, meaning the shortest cycle is 5. So any cycle of length 6 would have to be a longer cycle. Wait, but can you even get a 6-cycle in the Petersen graph?

Wait, let me check. In the standard Petersen graph, if you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. The inner pentagram is also a 5-cycle. If you traverse the spokes, you can get longer cycles. For example, starting at v1, go to u1, then to u2, then to v2, then to v3, then to u3, then to u4, then to v4, etc. But I think the cycles are either of length 5 or longer. But does it have a 6-cycle? Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1, go to v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, back to v1. Wait, is that a cycle? v1 to v2 (outer edge), v2 to v3 (outer edge), v3 to u3 (spoke), u3 to u4 (inner edge), u4 to v4 (spoke), v4 to v1 (outer edge). That&#x27;s a 6-cycle: v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1. But wait, does this form a cycle? Let&#x27;s check the connections:

v1 adjacent to v2: yes.

v2 adjacent to v3: yes.

v3 adjacent to u3: yes.

u3 adjacent to u4: in the inner pentagon, u3 is adjacent to u4 and u2, yes.

u4 adjacent to v4: yes.

v4 adjacent to v1: yes, if in the outer pentagon, v4 is adjacent to v5 and v3. Wait, no. Wait, the outer pentagon is v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, with each adjacent to the next. So v4 is adjacent to v3 and v5. So v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, the path v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1 is not a cycle because v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, that&#x27;s a 6-vertex path, but not a cycle.

Hmm. So maybe there&#x27;s no 6-cycle in the Petersen graph. Wait, but according to some references, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5, 6, 8, and 9, but I need to confirm. Let me think. If you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. If you take the inner pentagram, that&#x27;s another 5-cycle. For a 6-cycle, maybe traverse spokes and inner edges. For example: v1, u1, u2, v2, v3, u3, v1. Wait, but that would be v1 connected to u1, u1 connected to u2, u2 connected to v2, v2 connected to v3, v3 connected to u3, u3 connected to v1? Wait, u3 is not connected to v1. So that doesn&#x27;t form a cycle. Alternatively, v1, u1, u5, v5, v4, u4, v1. Let&#x27;s check: v1-u1, u1-u5 (inner edge), u5-v5, v5-v4, v4-u4, u4 connected to v1? No, u4 is connected to v4 and u3. So no. So maybe that&#x27;s not a cycle.

Alternatively, maybe another path. Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1: v1, v2, u2, u3, v3, v4, v1. But v4 is not connected to v1. Hmm. Maybe it&#x27;s not possible. Wait, actually, according to the properties of the Petersen graph, it is a 3-regular graph with girth 5, so the shortest cycle is 5, and it doesn&#x27;t have cycles of length 3 or 4. So perhaps there are cycles of length 6, but they are not induced cycles. Because an induced cycle would require that there are no chords, but in a 6-cycle, if there are chords, it&#x27;s not induced. Given that the Petersen graph is 3-regular, adding chords might complicate things. But since the girth is 5, there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So, a 6-cycle would have to be chordless, which would make it an induced cycle. But does such a cycle exist?

Wait, in the Petersen graph, can we find a 6-cycle? Let me check online in my mind. I recall that the Petersen graph does have cycles of length 6, but they are not induced. Wait, if the girth is 5, then any 6-cycle must have a chord, making it non-induced. Therefore, there are no induced 6-cycles. Therefore, any 6-vertex induced subgraph cannot be a cycle. So, perhaps the induced subgraphs on six vertices in the Petersen graph are not bipartite. But K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph. So, if the induced subgraph is not bipartite, it can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. Alternatively, even if it&#x27;s bipartite, it needs to be complete.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s take a different approach. Let&#x27;s check all possible 6-vertex induced subgraphs of the Petersen graph. Since the Petersen graph is small, maybe this is feasible. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices, so the number of 6-vertex induced subgraphs is C(10,6) = 210. That&#x27;s a lot, but maybe we can reason about their properties.

In an induced subgraph of six vertices, each vertex can have degree at most 3 (since the original graph is 3-regular). For it to be K_{3,3}, each vertex in one partition must have degree 3, connected to all three vertices in the other partition. So in total, each partition has three vertices, and all 9 edges are present between them. But in the induced subgraph, we need to have exactly those edges and no others.

But in the Petersen graph, any two adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Wait, no. Wait, in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. That&#x27;s a key property. Let me confirm. In the Petersen graph, if two vertices are non-adjacent, they have exactly one common neighbor. If they are adjacent, they have no common neighbors. Because it&#x27;s a strongly regular graph with parameters (10,3,0,1), which means each pair of adjacent vertices has 0 common neighbors, and each pair of non-adjacent vertices has 1 common neighbor.

Therefore, in the induced subgraph, if two vertices are adjacent in the Petersen graph, they have no common neighbors in the entire graph, so also in the induced subgraph. If two vertices are non-adjacent in the induced subgraph, they could be adjacent or non-adjacent in the whole graph. But if they are non-adjacent in the whole graph, they have one common neighbor in the whole graph, but that common neighbor might not be in the induced subgraph.

But let&#x27;s consider trying to form K_{3,3}. Suppose we have partitions A and B, each with three vertices. In K_{3,3}, every vertex in A is connected to every vertex in B, and there are no edges within A or within B. So in the induced subgraph, there should be no edges within A or within B, and all edges between A and B.

But in the Petersen graph, edges are arranged such that the outer pentagon and inner pentagram each have their own edges. Let&#x27;s think of the standard drawing. If we pick three vertices from the outer pentagon, they form a path or something. Each is connected to two others in the pentagon. So if we include three outer vertices, they have edges among themselves, which would violate the requirement of K_{3,3} having no edges within a partition. Similarly, three inner vertices would have edges among themselves. Therefore, if we pick three from the outer and three from the inner, the induced subgraph would have edges within the outer three, edges within the inner three, and some edges between them. But K_{3,3} has no edges within partitions. Therefore, such a subgraph would have extra edges, so it wouldn&#x27;t be a K_{3,3}.

Alternatively, maybe pick six vertices not split as three outer and three inner. But the Petersen graph is symmetric, so any six vertices would have a similar structure. Wait, but how else can you partition six vertices? Maybe two from outer, two from inner, and two others? But since the graph is symmetric, perhaps the induced subgraphs would still have edges within their groups.

Alternatively, consider another approach: the complement of the Petersen graph. But maybe that&#x27;s not helpful here.

Wait, another property: K_{3,3} has nine edges. The induced subgraph would need to have nine edges. Let&#x27;s calculate the number of edges in a 6-vertex induced subgraph of the Petersen graph. Each vertex has degree 3, but when you take an induced subgraph, each vertex can have degree between 0 and 3. The total number of edges in the induced subgraph can be calculated by summing the degrees and dividing by 2, but since we&#x27;re dealing with induced subgraphs, it&#x27;s just the number of edges present between those six vertices.

But how many edges can there be? Let&#x27;s see. In the entire Petersen graph, there are 15 edges. If we take six vertices, the maximum number of edges they can have is C(6,2) = 15, but obviously, the induced subgraph will have fewer since the Petersen graph isn&#x27;t complete. Given the regularity and structure, how many edges would a 6-vertex induced subgraph have?

Alternatively, since each vertex has degree 3, in the induced subgraph, each vertex can have at most 3 edges. But since the graph is 3-regular, each vertex has 3 edges in the whole graph. So in the induced subgraph, the degree of a vertex is the number of its neighbors that are also in the subgraph. So the number of edges in the induced subgraph would be half the sum of the degrees of the vertices within the subgraph. Since each vertex can contribute 0 to 3 edges, the total number of edges could be up to (6*3)/2 = 9, which is the number of edges in K_{3,3}. But is there an induced subgraph with 9 edges?

For that, each vertex in the subgraph would need to have degree 3 in the subgraph. But since the original graph is 3-regular, if a vertex has all three neighbors inside the subgraph, then it contributes 3 to the sum. If a vertex has, say, two neighbors inside the subgraph, it contributes 2, etc.

So to have 9 edges, the sum of degrees must be 18, but since each edge is counted twice, 9 edges correspond to sum of degrees 18. Therefore, each of the six vertices must have degree 3 in the induced subgraph, meaning each vertex is connected to all three others in the subgraph. But that would mean the induced subgraph is a 3-regular graph on six vertices. However, the only 3-regular graph on six vertices is the complete bipartite graph K_{3,3}, which is bipartite, and the complete tripartite graph... Wait, no. The 3-regular graphs on six vertices include K_{3,3} and the prism graph (two triangles connected by a matching), also known as the triangular prism, which is a 3-regular graph but not bipartite. So there are two 3-regular graphs on six vertices: K_{3,3} and the prism graph.

Therefore, if the induced subgraph is 3-regular, it could be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But in the Petersen graph, can we find an induced subgraph that&#x27;s 3-regular on six vertices? Let&#x27;s check.

If such a subgraph exists, it would need to be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But given the properties of the Petersen graph, like any two non-adjacent vertices having exactly one common neighbor, let&#x27;s see if a 3-regular induced subgraph is possible.

Suppose we have six vertices forming an induced subgraph. If it&#x27;s K_{3,3}, then it&#x27;s bipartite with partitions A and B. Each vertex in A is connected to all in B, and there are no edges within A or B. But in the Petersen graph, if we take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram, as before, they have edges within their own partitions. So that can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. If we take six vertices in some other configuration, perhaps?

Wait, the prism graph (two triangles connected by edges) is another 3-regular graph on six vertices. Let&#x27;s see if that exists as an induced subgraph in the Petersen graph. The prism graph has two triangles, each triangle being a 3-cycle. But the Petersen graph has girth 5, so it has no 3-cycles. Therefore, the prism graph cannot be a subgraph of the Petersen graph, induced or otherwise. Therefore, the only possible 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices would be K_{3,3}. But since the prism graph is excluded due to the girth, and K_{3,3} would require no edges within each partition, but any three vertices in the Petersen graph would have edges among themselves if they are from the outer or inner cycles.

Therefore, it&#x27;s impossible to have a 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices in the Petersen graph. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph. Thus, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph without induced K_5 or K_{3,3}, making it a counterexample to the original assertion.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample to refute the assertion that &quot;Every graph \( G \) without an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \) subgraph is planar,&quot; we need to check the following:

1. **Planarity of the Petersen Graph**: The Petersen graph is a well-known non-planar graph.
2. **Induced Subgraphs**: We need to verify if the Petersen graph contains an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \).

**Key Points**:
- The Petersen graph is non-planar.
- The Petersen graph is cubic (each vertex has degree 3), so it cannot contain \( K_5 \) as a subgraph (since \( K_5 \) requires each vertex to have degree 4).
- The Petersen graph does not contain \( K_{3,3} \) as an induced subgraph. This is because any induced subgraph of six vertices in the Petersen graph cannot be bipartite with all edges present between the two partitions (as required for \( K_{3,3} \)). The structure of the Petersen graph, with its girth of 5 and the property that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor, prevents the existence of such an induced subgraph.

**Conclusion**:
The Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \). Therefore, it serves as a counterexample to the given assertion.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the Petersen graph can be a counterexample to the statement that &quot;Every graph G without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 subgraph is planar.&quot; Hmm. Let&#x27;s break this down step by step.

First, let me recall some basics. A planar graph is one that can be drawn on the plane without any edges crossing. Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem tells us that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K_5 (the complete graph on five vertices) or K_{3,3} (the complete bipartite graph on six vertices, split into two sets of three). However, the question here is about induced subgraphs, not subdivisions. So the original assertion is saying that if a graph doesn&#x27;t have K_{3,3} or K_5 as an induced subgraph, then it must be planar. If the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have these as induced subgraphs but is itself non-planar, then it would be a counterexample.

Alright, so let me recall the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s a well-known non-planar graph. I remember that it doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but wait, does it contain them as induced subgraphs? That&#x27;s the key here. The original assertion is about induced subgraphs, so even if the Petersen graph had a K_{3,3} or K_5 as a subgraph but not induced, it wouldn&#x27;t matter. The question is specifically about induced ones.

Let me confirm. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges. It&#x27;s a cubic graph (each vertex has degree 3). K_5 has 10 edges and is a complete graph, so each vertex has degree 4. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, it can&#x27;t contain K_5 as a subgraph because you can&#x27;t have a vertex with degree 4 in a cubic graph. Similarly, K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph with each vertex of degree 3. So maybe K_{3,3} could be a subgraph? But again, the question is about induced subgraphs.

An induced subgraph is a subset of the vertices of a graph together with all the edges whose endpoints are both in this subset. So even if the Petersen graph has a subgraph isomorphic to K_{3,3}, unless all the edges present in K_{3,3} between those vertices are also present in the Petersen graph, it&#x27;s not an induced subgraph.

Let me check if the Petersen graph contains an induced K_{3,3}. The Petersen graph is known to be non-planar, but according to Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem, it must contain a subdivision of K_5 or K_{3,3}. Indeed, the Petersen graph is a famous example of a non-planar graph that doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but it does contain a subdivision of K_{3,3}. However, a subdivision is different from an induced subgraph. Subdividing edges adds new vertices on the edges, so a subdivided K_{3,3} would not be an induced subgraph because the original edges are split into paths.

Therefore, the Petersen graph itself is non-planar, but does it contain an induced K_5 or K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s check K_5 first. As mentioned, all vertices in the Petersen graph have degree 3, but in K_5, every vertex has degree 4. So even if you take any 5 vertices in the Petersen graph, they can&#x27;t form a K_5 because the degrees are insufficient. So, there&#x27;s no induced K_5.

What about K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s see. K_{3,3} is bipartite, with two partitions each containing three vertices, and every vertex in one partition connected to every vertex in the other. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex has degree 3. If there was an induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph, each vertex in one partition would need to be connected to all three vertices in the other partition. But since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex can only have three edges. However, in K_{3,3}, each vertex is connected to three vertices in the opposite partition. So, if a vertex in the induced subgraph is part of the K_{3,3}, all its neighbors in the Petersen graph must be within the K_{3,3} as well. But in the Petersen graph, the neighborhoods are structured such that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let me try to visualize the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s usually drawn as a pentagon connected to a pentagram, with each vertex of the pentagon connected to a corresponding vertex of the pentagram. Each vertex is connected to three others: two in its own pentagon/pentagram and one in the other.

Suppose we try to find an induced K_{3,3}. Let&#x27;s take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices and one outer vertex. If we pick three outer vertices and three inner ones, perhaps we can form a bipartition. However, in the Petersen graph, each outer vertex is connected to only one inner vertex, and each inner vertex is connected to only one outer vertex. So, for example, if we take three outer vertices and their corresponding three inner vertices (each connected by a spoke), the edges between the outer and inner vertices would only be the three spokes. But in K_{3,3}, every outer vertex must connect to every inner vertex. In this case, each outer vertex is only connected to one inner vertex, so that&#x27;s only three edges between the partitions, whereas K_{3,3} would require nine edges (3x3). So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Alternatively, maybe if we select different sets of three vertices. Let me think. Since the Petersen graph is symmetric, any selection of six vertices should be similar. Suppose we try to find a bipartite induced subgraph with partitions of size three and three. The problem is that in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let&#x27;s say we pick three vertices from one partition. Each needs to be connected to all three in the other partition. But given the structure of the Petersen graph, each vertex is only connected to three others. If a vertex is in one partition, to connect to all three in the other partition, that would require three edges. But if the other partition has three vertices, each of those would need to connect back to all three in the first partition. However, each vertex in the other partition is already connected to two others in their own partition (if they are on the pentagon or pentagram) and one in the opposite. So they can&#x27;t have three edges to the first partition. Hence, it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph.

Therefore, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as an induced subgraph. Thus, it would serve as a counterexample to the assertion that every graph without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 is planar.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in reasoning about K_{3,3}. Let me try to see if there is a subset of six vertices in the Petersen graph that induce a K_{3,3}. Take the Petersen graph and label the outer pentagon vertices as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 and the inner pentagram vertices as u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, where each ui is connected to vi. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices (in the pentagram) and one outer vertex. So, suppose we take three outer vertices, say v1, v2, v3, and three inner vertices, say u4, u5, u1. Wait, u1 is connected to v1. Let&#x27;s see. The connections between the outer and inner vertices are only the spokes, so v1 is connected to u1, v2 to u2, etc. If we take v1, v2, v3 from the outer and u4, u5, u1 from the inner, then v1 is connected to u1, v2 is connected to u2 (which is not in the set), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set). So, in this subset, the only edges between the outer and inner are v1-u1. The rest of the edges would be the outer edges (v1-v2, v2-v3, v3-v4, etc.), but since we took only v1, v2, v3, the outer edges are v1-v2, v2-v3. The inner vertices u4, u5, u1: in the inner pentagram, u4 is connected to u5 and u3, but u3 isn&#x27;t in the set. u5 is connected to u4 and u1. u1 is connected to u5 and u2 (which isn&#x27;t in the set). So within the inner subset, u4 is connected to u5, u5 is connected to u1, and u1 is connected to no one else in the inner subset. So the induced subgraph on these six vertices would have edges: between outer vertices: v1-v2, v2-v3; between inner vertices: u4-u5, u5-u1; and the spoke edge v1-u1. That&#x27;s nothing like K_{3,3}; it&#x27;s missing almost all the edges.

Alternatively, pick six vertices in some other way. Maybe three from the outer and three from the inner, but not corresponding. For example, take v1, v3, v5 from the outer and u2, u4, u5 from the inner. Let&#x27;s check edges. The outer edges: v1 connected to v2 and v5 (but v2 and v5 are not in the set), so v1 only connected to v5. Wait, no, in the outer pentagon, v1 is connected to v2 and v5. But if we take v1, v3, v5, then v1 is connected to v5 (since they&#x27;re adjacent on the pentagon), v3 is connected to v4 and v2 (neither in the set), and v5 is connected to v1 and v4 (not in the set). So the outer subset has edges v1-v5. The inner subset u2, u4, u5: u2 is connected to u1 and u3 (not in the set), u4 is connected to u3 and u5, u5 is connected to u4 and u1 (not in the set). So u4-u5 is an edge. Between the outer and inner: v1 connected to u1 (not in the inner subset), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set), v5 connected to u5. So only v5-u5 is an edge. So the induced subgraph has edges v1-v5, u4-u5, and v5-u5. That&#x27;s just a triangle? Wait, no. v1 is connected to v5, v5 is connected to u5, and u5 is connected to u4. So it&#x27;s a path of three edges. Not K_{3,3}.

Hmm. Maybe trying different combinations. Alternatively, maybe pick vertices not all from outer and inner. Wait, but the Petersen graph is symmetric, so it shouldn&#x27;t matter. But perhaps if I pick vertices that form a 6-cycle or something. Wait, the Petersen graph has girth 5, so there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So any induced subgraph with a 6-cycle would have to be a hexagon, but the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have a 6-cycle. Wait, actually, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5 and 6? Wait, no, the girth is 5, meaning the shortest cycle is 5. So any cycle of length 6 would have to be a longer cycle. Wait, but can you even get a 6-cycle in the Petersen graph?

Wait, let me check. In the standard Petersen graph, if you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. The inner pentagram is also a 5-cycle. If you traverse the spokes, you can get longer cycles. For example, starting at v1, go to u1, then to u2, then to v2, then to v3, then to u3, then to u4, then to v4, etc. But I think the cycles are either of length 5 or longer. But does it have a 6-cycle? Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1, go to v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, back to v1. Wait, is that a cycle? v1 to v2 (outer edge), v2 to v3 (outer edge), v3 to u3 (spoke), u3 to u4 (inner edge), u4 to v4 (spoke), v4 to v1 (outer edge). That&#x27;s a 6-cycle: v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1. But wait, does this form a cycle? Let&#x27;s check the connections:

v1 adjacent to v2: yes.

v2 adjacent to v3: yes.

v3 adjacent to u3: yes.

u3 adjacent to u4: in the inner pentagon, u3 is adjacent to u4 and u2, yes.

u4 adjacent to v4: yes.

v4 adjacent to v1: yes, if in the outer pentagon, v4 is adjacent to v5 and v3. Wait, no. Wait, the outer pentagon is v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, with each adjacent to the next. So v4 is adjacent to v3 and v5. So v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, the path v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1 is not a cycle because v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, that&#x27;s a 6-vertex path, but not a cycle.

Hmm. So maybe there&#x27;s no 6-cycle in the Petersen graph. Wait, but according to some references, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5, 6, 8, and 9, but I need to confirm. Let me think. If you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. If you take the inner pentagram, that&#x27;s another 5-cycle. For a 6-cycle, maybe traverse spokes and inner edges. For example: v1, u1, u2, v2, v3, u3, v1. Wait, but that would be v1 connected to u1, u1 connected to u2, u2 connected to v2, v2 connected to v3, v3 connected to u3, u3 connected to v1? Wait, u3 is not connected to v1. So that doesn&#x27;t form a cycle. Alternatively, v1, u1, u5, v5, v4, u4, v1. Let&#x27;s check: v1-u1, u1-u5 (inner edge), u5-v5, v5-v4, v4-u4, u4 connected to v1? No, u4 is connected to v4 and u3. So no. So maybe that&#x27;s not a cycle.

Alternatively, maybe another path. Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1: v1, v2, u2, u3, v3, v4, v1. But v4 is not connected to v1. Hmm. Maybe it&#x27;s not possible. Wait, actually, according to the properties of the Petersen graph, it is a 3-regular graph with girth 5, so the shortest cycle is 5, and it doesn&#x27;t have cycles of length 3 or 4. So perhaps there are cycles of length 6, but they are not induced cycles. Because an induced cycle would require that there are no chords, but in a 6-cycle, if there are chords, it&#x27;s not induced. Given that the Petersen graph is 3-regular, adding chords might complicate things. But since the girth is 5, there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So, a 6-cycle would have to be chordless, which would make it an induced cycle. But does such a cycle exist?

Wait, in the Petersen graph, can we find a 6-cycle? Let me check online in my mind. I recall that the Petersen graph does have cycles of length 6, but they are not induced. Wait, if the girth is 5, then any 6-cycle must have a chord, making it non-induced. Therefore, there are no induced 6-cycles. Therefore, any 6-vertex induced subgraph cannot be a cycle. So, perhaps the induced subgraphs on six vertices in the Petersen graph are not bipartite. But K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph. So, if the induced subgraph is not bipartite, it can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. Alternatively, even if it&#x27;s bipartite, it needs to be complete.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s take a different approach. Let&#x27;s check all possible 6-vertex induced subgraphs of the Petersen graph. Since the Petersen graph is small, maybe this is feasible. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices, so the number of 6-vertex induced subgraphs is C(10,6) = 210. That&#x27;s a lot, but maybe we can reason about their properties.

In an induced subgraph of six vertices, each vertex can have degree at most 3 (since the original graph is 3-regular). For it to be K_{3,3}, each vertex in one partition must have degree 3, connected to all three vertices in the other partition. So in total, each partition has three vertices, and all 9 edges are present between them. But in the induced subgraph, we need to have exactly those edges and no others.

But in the Petersen graph, any two adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Wait, no. Wait, in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. That&#x27;s a key property. Let me confirm. In the Petersen graph, if two vertices are non-adjacent, they have exactly one common neighbor. If they are adjacent, they have no common neighbors. Because it&#x27;s a strongly regular graph with parameters (10,3,0,1), which means each pair of adjacent vertices has 0 common neighbors, and each pair of non-adjacent vertices has 1 common neighbor.

Therefore, in the induced subgraph, if two vertices are adjacent in the Petersen graph, they have no common neighbors in the entire graph, so also in the induced subgraph. If two vertices are non-adjacent in the induced subgraph, they could be adjacent or non-adjacent in the whole graph. But if they are non-adjacent in the whole graph, they have one common neighbor in the whole graph, but that common neighbor might not be in the induced subgraph.

But let&#x27;s consider trying to form K_{3,3}. Suppose we have partitions A and B, each with three vertices. In K_{3,3}, every vertex in A is connected to every vertex in B, and there are no edges within A or within B. So in the induced subgraph, there should be no edges within A or within B, and all edges between A and B.

But in the Petersen graph, edges are arranged such that the outer pentagon and inner pentagram each have their own edges. Let&#x27;s think of the standard drawing. If we pick three vertices from the outer pentagon, they form a path or something. Each is connected to two others in the pentagon. So if we include three outer vertices, they have edges among themselves, which would violate the requirement of K_{3,3} having no edges within a partition. Similarly, three inner vertices would have edges among themselves. Therefore, if we pick three from the outer and three from the inner, the induced subgraph would have edges within the outer three, edges within the inner three, and some edges between them. But K_{3,3} has no edges within partitions. Therefore, such a subgraph would have extra edges, so it wouldn&#x27;t be a K_{3,3}.

Alternatively, maybe pick six vertices not split as three outer and three inner. But the Petersen graph is symmetric, so any six vertices would have a similar structure. Wait, but how else can you partition six vertices? Maybe two from outer, two from inner, and two others? But since the graph is symmetric, perhaps the induced subgraphs would still have edges within their groups.

Alternatively, consider another approach: the complement of the Petersen graph. But maybe that&#x27;s not helpful here.

Wait, another property: K_{3,3} has nine edges. The induced subgraph would need to have nine edges. Let&#x27;s calculate the number of edges in a 6-vertex induced subgraph of the Petersen graph. Each vertex has degree 3, but when you take an induced subgraph, each vertex can have degree between 0 and 3. The total number of edges in the induced subgraph can be calculated by summing the degrees and dividing by 2, but since we&#x27;re dealing with induced subgraphs, it&#x27;s just the number of edges present between those six vertices.

But how many edges can there be? Let&#x27;s see. In the entire Petersen graph, there are 15 edges. If we take six vertices, the maximum number of edges they can have is C(6,2) = 15, but obviously, the induced subgraph will have fewer since the Petersen graph isn&#x27;t complete. Given the regularity and structure, how many edges would a 6-vertex induced subgraph have?

Alternatively, since each vertex has degree 3, in the induced subgraph, each vertex can have at most 3 edges. But since the graph is 3-regular, each vertex has 3 edges in the whole graph. So in the induced subgraph, the degree of a vertex is the number of its neighbors that are also in the subgraph. So the number of edges in the induced subgraph would be half the sum of the degrees of the vertices within the subgraph. Since each vertex can contribute 0 to 3 edges, the total number of edges could be up to (6*3)/2 = 9, which is the number of edges in K_{3,3}. But is there an induced subgraph with 9 edges?

For that, each vertex in the subgraph would need to have degree 3 in the subgraph. But since the original graph is 3-regular, if a vertex has all three neighbors inside the subgraph, then it contributes 3 to the sum. If a vertex has, say, two neighbors inside the subgraph, it contributes 2, etc.

So to have 9 edges, the sum of degrees must be 18, but since each edge is counted twice, 9 edges correspond to sum of degrees 18. Therefore, each of the six vertices must have degree 3 in the induced subgraph, meaning each vertex is connected to all three others in the subgraph. But that would mean the induced subgraph is a 3-regular graph on six vertices. However, the only 3-regular graph on six vertices is the complete bipartite graph K_{3,3}, which is bipartite, and the complete tripartite graph... Wait, no. The 3-regular graphs on six vertices include K_{3,3} and the prism graph (two triangles connected by a matching), also known as the triangular prism, which is a 3-regular graph but not bipartite. So there are two 3-regular graphs on six vertices: K_{3,3} and the prism graph.

Therefore, if the induced subgraph is 3-regular, it could be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But in the Petersen graph, can we find an induced subgraph that&#x27;s 3-regular on six vertices? Let&#x27;s check.

If such a subgraph exists, it would need to be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But given the properties of the Petersen graph, like any two non-adjacent vertices having exactly one common neighbor, let&#x27;s see if a 3-regular induced subgraph is possible.

Suppose we have six vertices forming an induced subgraph. If it&#x27;s K_{3,3}, then it&#x27;s bipartite with partitions A and B. Each vertex in A is connected to all in B, and there are no edges within A or B. But in the Petersen graph, if we take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram, as before, they have edges within their own partitions. So that can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. If we take six vertices in some other configuration, perhaps?

Wait, the prism graph (two triangles connected by edges) is another 3-regular graph on six vertices. Let&#x27;s see if that exists as an induced subgraph in the Petersen graph. The prism graph has two triangles, each triangle being a 3-cycle. But the Petersen graph has girth 5, so it has no 3-cycles. Therefore, the prism graph cannot be a subgraph of the Petersen graph, induced or otherwise. Therefore, the only possible 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices would be K_{3,3}. But since the prism graph is excluded due to the girth, and K_{3,3} would require no edges within each partition, but any three vertices in the Petersen graph would have edges among themselves if they are from the outer or inner cycles.

Therefore, it&#x27;s impossible to have a 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices in the Petersen graph. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph. Thus, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph without induced K_5 or K_{3,3}, making it a counterexample to the original assertion.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample to refute the assertion that &quot;Every graph \( G \) without an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \) subgraph is planar,&quot; we need to check the following:

1. **Planarity of the Petersen Graph**: The Petersen graph is a well-known non-planar graph.
2. **Induced Subgraphs**: We need to verify if the Petersen graph contains an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \).

**Key Points**:
- The Petersen graph is non-planar.
- The Petersen graph is cubic (each vertex has degree 3), so it cannot contain \( K_5 \) as a subgraph (since \( K_5 \) requires each vertex to have degree 4).
- The Petersen graph does not contain \( K_{3,3} \) as an induced subgraph. This is because any induced subgraph of six vertices in the Petersen graph cannot be bipartite with all edges present between the two partitions (as required for \( K_{3,3} \)). The structure of the Petersen graph, with its girth of 5 and the property that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor, prevents the existence of such an induced subgraph.

**Conclusion**:
The Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \). Therefore, it serves as a counterexample to the given assertion.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the Petersen graph can be a counterexample to the statement that &quot;Every graph G without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 subgraph is planar.&quot; Hmm. Let&#x27;s break this down step by step.

First, let me recall some basics. A planar graph is one that can be drawn on the plane without any edges crossing. Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem tells us that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K_5 (the complete graph on five vertices) or K_{3,3} (the complete bipartite graph on six vertices, split into two sets of three). However, the question here is about induced subgraphs, not subdivisions. So the original assertion is saying that if a graph doesn&#x27;t have K_{3,3} or K_5 as an induced subgraph, then it must be planar. If the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have these as induced subgraphs but is itself non-planar, then it would be a counterexample.

Alright, so let me recall the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s a well-known non-planar graph. I remember that it doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but wait, does it contain them as induced subgraphs? That&#x27;s the key here. The original assertion is about induced subgraphs, so even if the Petersen graph had a K_{3,3} or K_5 as a subgraph but not induced, it wouldn&#x27;t matter. The question is specifically about induced ones.

Let me confirm. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges. It&#x27;s a cubic graph (each vertex has degree 3). K_5 has 10 edges and is a complete graph, so each vertex has degree 4. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, it can&#x27;t contain K_5 as a subgraph because you can&#x27;t have a vertex with degree 4 in a cubic graph. Similarly, K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph with each vertex of degree 3. So maybe K_{3,3} could be a subgraph? But again, the question is about induced subgraphs.

An induced subgraph is a subset of the vertices of a graph together with all the edges whose endpoints are both in this subset. So even if the Petersen graph has a subgraph isomorphic to K_{3,3}, unless all the edges present in K_{3,3} between those vertices are also present in the Petersen graph, it&#x27;s not an induced subgraph.

Let me check if the Petersen graph contains an induced K_{3,3}. The Petersen graph is known to be non-planar, but according to Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem, it must contain a subdivision of K_5 or K_{3,3}. Indeed, the Petersen graph is a famous example of a non-planar graph that doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but it does contain a subdivision of K_{3,3}. However, a subdivision is different from an induced subgraph. Subdividing edges adds new vertices on the edges, so a subdivided K_{3,3} would not be an induced subgraph because the original edges are split into paths.

Therefore, the Petersen graph itself is non-planar, but does it contain an induced K_5 or K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s check K_5 first. As mentioned, all vertices in the Petersen graph have degree 3, but in K_5, every vertex has degree 4. So even if you take any 5 vertices in the Petersen graph, they can&#x27;t form a K_5 because the degrees are insufficient. So, there&#x27;s no induced K_5.

What about K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s see. K_{3,3} is bipartite, with two partitions each containing three vertices, and every vertex in one partition connected to every vertex in the other. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex has degree 3. If there was an induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph, each vertex in one partition would need to be connected to all three vertices in the other partition. But since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex can only have three edges. However, in K_{3,3}, each vertex is connected to three vertices in the opposite partition. So, if a vertex in the induced subgraph is part of the K_{3,3}, all its neighbors in the Petersen graph must be within the K_{3,3} as well. But in the Petersen graph, the neighborhoods are structured such that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let me try to visualize the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s usually drawn as a pentagon connected to a pentagram, with each vertex of the pentagon connected to a corresponding vertex of the pentagram. Each vertex is connected to three others: two in its own pentagon/pentagram and one in the other.

Suppose we try to find an induced K_{3,3}. Let&#x27;s take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices and one outer vertex. If we pick three outer vertices and three inner ones, perhaps we can form a bipartition. However, in the Petersen graph, each outer vertex is connected to only one inner vertex, and each inner vertex is connected to only one outer vertex. So, for example, if we take three outer vertices and their corresponding three inner vertices (each connected by a spoke), the edges between the outer and inner vertices would only be the three spokes. But in K_{3,3}, every outer vertex must connect to every inner vertex. In this case, each outer vertex is only connected to one inner vertex, so that&#x27;s only three edges between the partitions, whereas K_{3,3} would require nine edges (3x3). So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Alternatively, maybe if we select different sets of three vertices. Let me think. Since the Petersen graph is symmetric, any selection of six vertices should be similar. Suppose we try to find a bipartite induced subgraph with partitions of size three and three. The problem is that in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let&#x27;s say we pick three vertices from one partition. Each needs to be connected to all three in the other partition. But given the structure of the Petersen graph, each vertex is only connected to three others. If a vertex is in one partition, to connect to all three in the other partition, that would require three edges. But if the other partition has three vertices, each of those would need to connect back to all three in the first partition. However, each vertex in the other partition is already connected to two others in their own partition (if they are on the pentagon or pentagram) and one in the opposite. So they can&#x27;t have three edges to the first partition. Hence, it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph.

Therefore, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as an induced subgraph. Thus, it would serve as a counterexample to the assertion that every graph without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 is planar.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in reasoning about K_{3,3}. Let me try to see if there is a subset of six vertices in the Petersen graph that induce a K_{3,3}. Take the Petersen graph and label the outer pentagon vertices as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 and the inner pentagram vertices as u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, where each ui is connected to vi. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices (in the pentagram) and one outer vertex. So, suppose we take three outer vertices, say v1, v2, v3, and three inner vertices, say u4, u5, u1. Wait, u1 is connected to v1. Let&#x27;s see. The connections between the outer and inner vertices are only the spokes, so v1 is connected to u1, v2 to u2, etc. If we take v1, v2, v3 from the outer and u4, u5, u1 from the inner, then v1 is connected to u1, v2 is connected to u2 (which is not in the set), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set). So, in this subset, the only edges between the outer and inner are v1-u1. The rest of the edges would be the outer edges (v1-v2, v2-v3, v3-v4, etc.), but since we took only v1, v2, v3, the outer edges are v1-v2, v2-v3. The inner vertices u4, u5, u1: in the inner pentagram, u4 is connected to u5 and u3, but u3 isn&#x27;t in the set. u5 is connected to u4 and u1. u1 is connected to u5 and u2 (which isn&#x27;t in the set). So within the inner subset, u4 is connected to u5, u5 is connected to u1, and u1 is connected to no one else in the inner subset. So the induced subgraph on these six vertices would have edges: between outer vertices: v1-v2, v2-v3; between inner vertices: u4-u5, u5-u1; and the spoke edge v1-u1. That&#x27;s nothing like K_{3,3}; it&#x27;s missing almost all the edges.

Alternatively, pick six vertices in some other way. Maybe three from the outer and three from the inner, but not corresponding. For example, take v1, v3, v5 from the outer and u2, u4, u5 from the inner. Let&#x27;s check edges. The outer edges: v1 connected to v2 and v5 (but v2 and v5 are not in the set), so v1 only connected to v5. Wait, no, in the outer pentagon, v1 is connected to v2 and v5. But if we take v1, v3, v5, then v1 is connected to v5 (since they&#x27;re adjacent on the pentagon), v3 is connected to v4 and v2 (neither in the set), and v5 is connected to v1 and v4 (not in the set). So the outer subset has edges v1-v5. The inner subset u2, u4, u5: u2 is connected to u1 and u3 (not in the set), u4 is connected to u3 and u5, u5 is connected to u4 and u1 (not in the set). So u4-u5 is an edge. Between the outer and inner: v1 connected to u1 (not in the inner subset), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set), v5 connected to u5. So only v5-u5 is an edge. So the induced subgraph has edges v1-v5, u4-u5, and v5-u5. That&#x27;s just a triangle? Wait, no. v1 is connected to v5, v5 is connected to u5, and u5 is connected to u4. So it&#x27;s a path of three edges. Not K_{3,3}.

Hmm. Maybe trying different combinations. Alternatively, maybe pick vertices not all from outer and inner. Wait, but the Petersen graph is symmetric, so it shouldn&#x27;t matter. But perhaps if I pick vertices that form a 6-cycle or something. Wait, the Petersen graph has girth 5, so there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So any induced subgraph with a 6-cycle would have to be a hexagon, but the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have a 6-cycle. Wait, actually, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5 and 6? Wait, no, the girth is 5, meaning the shortest cycle is 5. So any cycle of length 6 would have to be a longer cycle. Wait, but can you even get a 6-cycle in the Petersen graph?

Wait, let me check. In the standard Petersen graph, if you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. The inner pentagram is also a 5-cycle. If you traverse the spokes, you can get longer cycles. For example, starting at v1, go to u1, then to u2, then to v2, then to v3, then to u3, then to u4, then to v4, etc. But I think the cycles are either of length 5 or longer. But does it have a 6-cycle? Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1, go to v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, back to v1. Wait, is that a cycle? v1 to v2 (outer edge), v2 to v3 (outer edge), v3 to u3 (spoke), u3 to u4 (inner edge), u4 to v4 (spoke), v4 to v1 (outer edge). That&#x27;s a 6-cycle: v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1. But wait, does this form a cycle? Let&#x27;s check the connections:

v1 adjacent to v2: yes.

v2 adjacent to v3: yes.

v3 adjacent to u3: yes.

u3 adjacent to u4: in the inner pentagon, u3 is adjacent to u4 and u2, yes.

u4 adjacent to v4: yes.

v4 adjacent to v1: yes, if in the outer pentagon, v4 is adjacent to v5 and v3. Wait, no. Wait, the outer pentagon is v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, with each adjacent to the next. So v4 is adjacent to v3 and v5. So v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, the path v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1 is not a cycle because v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, that&#x27;s a 6-vertex path, but not a cycle.

Hmm. So maybe there&#x27;s no 6-cycle in the Petersen graph. Wait, but according to some references, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5, 6, 8, and 9, but I need to confirm. Let me think. If you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. If you take the inner pentagram, that&#x27;s another 5-cycle. For a 6-cycle, maybe traverse spokes and inner edges. For example: v1, u1, u2, v2, v3, u3, v1. Wait, but that would be v1 connected to u1, u1 connected to u2, u2 connected to v2, v2 connected to v3, v3 connected to u3, u3 connected to v1? Wait, u3 is not connected to v1. So that doesn&#x27;t form a cycle. Alternatively, v1, u1, u5, v5, v4, u4, v1. Let&#x27;s check: v1-u1, u1-u5 (inner edge), u5-v5, v5-v4, v4-u4, u4 connected to v1? No, u4 is connected to v4 and u3. So no. So maybe that&#x27;s not a cycle.

Alternatively, maybe another path. Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1: v1, v2, u2, u3, v3, v4, v1. But v4 is not connected to v1. Hmm. Maybe it&#x27;s not possible. Wait, actually, according to the properties of the Petersen graph, it is a 3-regular graph with girth 5, so the shortest cycle is 5, and it doesn&#x27;t have cycles of length 3 or 4. So perhaps there are cycles of length 6, but they are not induced cycles. Because an induced cycle would require that there are no chords, but in a 6-cycle, if there are chords, it&#x27;s not induced. Given that the Petersen graph is 3-regular, adding chords might complicate things. But since the girth is 5, there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So, a 6-cycle would have to be chordless, which would make it an induced cycle. But does such a cycle exist?

Wait, in the Petersen graph, can we find a 6-cycle? Let me check online in my mind. I recall that the Petersen graph does have cycles of length 6, but they are not induced. Wait, if the girth is 5, then any 6-cycle must have a chord, making it non-induced. Therefore, there are no induced 6-cycles. Therefore, any 6-vertex induced subgraph cannot be a cycle. So, perhaps the induced subgraphs on six vertices in the Petersen graph are not bipartite. But K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph. So, if the induced subgraph is not bipartite, it can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. Alternatively, even if it&#x27;s bipartite, it needs to be complete.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s take a different approach. Let&#x27;s check all possible 6-vertex induced subgraphs of the Petersen graph. Since the Petersen graph is small, maybe this is feasible. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices, so the number of 6-vertex induced subgraphs is C(10,6) = 210. That&#x27;s a lot, but maybe we can reason about their properties.

In an induced subgraph of six vertices, each vertex can have degree at most 3 (since the original graph is 3-regular). For it to be K_{3,3}, each vertex in one partition must have degree 3, connected to all three vertices in the other partition. So in total, each partition has three vertices, and all 9 edges are present between them. But in the induced subgraph, we need to have exactly those edges and no others.

But in the Petersen graph, any two adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Wait, no. Wait, in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. That&#x27;s a key property. Let me confirm. In the Petersen graph, if two vertices are non-adjacent, they have exactly one common neighbor. If they are adjacent, they have no common neighbors. Because it&#x27;s a strongly regular graph with parameters (10,3,0,1), which means each pair of adjacent vertices has 0 common neighbors, and each pair of non-adjacent vertices has 1 common neighbor.

Therefore, in the induced subgraph, if two vertices are adjacent in the Petersen graph, they have no common neighbors in the entire graph, so also in the induced subgraph. If two vertices are non-adjacent in the induced subgraph, they could be adjacent or non-adjacent in the whole graph. But if they are non-adjacent in the whole graph, they have one common neighbor in the whole graph, but that common neighbor might not be in the induced subgraph.

But let&#x27;s consider trying to form K_{3,3}. Suppose we have partitions A and B, each with three vertices. In K_{3,3}, every vertex in A is connected to every vertex in B, and there are no edges within A or within B. So in the induced subgraph, there should be no edges within A or within B, and all edges between A and B.

But in the Petersen graph, edges are arranged such that the outer pentagon and inner pentagram each have their own edges. Let&#x27;s think of the standard drawing. If we pick three vertices from the outer pentagon, they form a path or something. Each is connected to two others in the pentagon. So if we include three outer vertices, they have edges among themselves, which would violate the requirement of K_{3,3} having no edges within a partition. Similarly, three inner vertices would have edges among themselves. Therefore, if we pick three from the outer and three from the inner, the induced subgraph would have edges within the outer three, edges within the inner three, and some edges between them. But K_{3,3} has no edges within partitions. Therefore, such a subgraph would have extra edges, so it wouldn&#x27;t be a K_{3,3}.

Alternatively, maybe pick six vertices not split as three outer and three inner. But the Petersen graph is symmetric, so any six vertices would have a similar structure. Wait, but how else can you partition six vertices? Maybe two from outer, two from inner, and two others? But since the graph is symmetric, perhaps the induced subgraphs would still have edges within their groups.

Alternatively, consider another approach: the complement of the Petersen graph. But maybe that&#x27;s not helpful here.

Wait, another property: K_{3,3} has nine edges. The induced subgraph would need to have nine edges. Let&#x27;s calculate the number of edges in a 6-vertex induced subgraph of the Petersen graph. Each vertex has degree 3, but when you take an induced subgraph, each vertex can have degree between 0 and 3. The total number of edges in the induced subgraph can be calculated by summing the degrees and dividing by 2, but since we&#x27;re dealing with induced subgraphs, it&#x27;s just the number of edges present between those six vertices.

But how many edges can there be? Let&#x27;s see. In the entire Petersen graph, there are 15 edges. If we take six vertices, the maximum number of edges they can have is C(6,2) = 15, but obviously, the induced subgraph will have fewer since the Petersen graph isn&#x27;t complete. Given the regularity and structure, how many edges would a 6-vertex induced subgraph have?

Alternatively, since each vertex has degree 3, in the induced subgraph, each vertex can have at most 3 edges. But since the graph is 3-regular, each vertex has 3 edges in the whole graph. So in the induced subgraph, the degree of a vertex is the number of its neighbors that are also in the subgraph. So the number of edges in the induced subgraph would be half the sum of the degrees of the vertices within the subgraph. Since each vertex can contribute 0 to 3 edges, the total number of edges could be up to (6*3)/2 = 9, which is the number of edges in K_{3,3}. But is there an induced subgraph with 9 edges?

For that, each vertex in the subgraph would need to have degree 3 in the subgraph. But since the original graph is 3-regular, if a vertex has all three neighbors inside the subgraph, then it contributes 3 to the sum. If a vertex has, say, two neighbors inside the subgraph, it contributes 2, etc.

So to have 9 edges, the sum of degrees must be 18, but since each edge is counted twice, 9 edges correspond to sum of degrees 18. Therefore, each of the six vertices must have degree 3 in the induced subgraph, meaning each vertex is connected to all three others in the subgraph. But that would mean the induced subgraph is a 3-regular graph on six vertices. However, the only 3-regular graph on six vertices is the complete bipartite graph K_{3,3}, which is bipartite, and the complete tripartite graph... Wait, no. The 3-regular graphs on six vertices include K_{3,3} and the prism graph (two triangles connected by a matching), also known as the triangular prism, which is a 3-regular graph but not bipartite. So there are two 3-regular graphs on six vertices: K_{3,3} and the prism graph.

Therefore, if the induced subgraph is 3-regular, it could be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But in the Petersen graph, can we find an induced subgraph that&#x27;s 3-regular on six vertices? Let&#x27;s check.

If such a subgraph exists, it would need to be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But given the properties of the Petersen graph, like any two non-adjacent vertices having exactly one common neighbor, let&#x27;s see if a 3-regular induced subgraph is possible.

Suppose we have six vertices forming an induced subgraph. If it&#x27;s K_{3,3}, then it&#x27;s bipartite with partitions A and B. Each vertex in A is connected to all in B, and there are no edges within A or B. But in the Petersen graph, if we take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram, as before, they have edges within their own partitions. So that can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. If we take six vertices in some other configuration, perhaps?

Wait, the prism graph (two triangles connected by edges) is another 3-regular graph on six vertices. Let&#x27;s see if that exists as an induced subgraph in the Petersen graph. The prism graph has two triangles, each triangle being a 3-cycle. But the Petersen graph has girth 5, so it has no 3-cycles. Therefore, the prism graph cannot be a subgraph of the Petersen graph, induced or otherwise. Therefore, the only possible 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices would be K_{3,3}. But since the prism graph is excluded due to the girth, and K_{3,3} would require no edges within each partition, but any three vertices in the Petersen graph would have edges among themselves if they are from the outer or inner cycles.

Therefore, it&#x27;s impossible to have a 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices in the Petersen graph. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph. Thus, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph without induced K_5 or K_{3,3}, making it a counterexample to the original assertion.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample to refute the assertion that &quot;Every graph \( G \) without an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \) subgraph is planar,&quot; we need to check the following:

1. **Planarity of the Petersen Graph**: The Petersen graph is a well-known non-planar graph.
2. **Induced Subgraphs**: We need to verify if the Petersen graph contains an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \).

**Key Points**:
- The Petersen graph is non-planar.
- The Petersen graph is cubic (each vertex has degree 3), so it cannot contain \( K_5 \) as a subgraph (since \( K_5 \) requires each vertex to have degree 4).
- The Petersen graph does not contain \( K_{3,3} \) as an induced subgraph. This is because any induced subgraph of six vertices in the Petersen graph cannot be bipartite with all edges present between the two partitions (as required for \( K_{3,3} \)). The structure of the Petersen graph, with its girth of 5 and the property that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor, prevents the existence of such an induced subgraph.

**Conclusion**:
The Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \). Therefore, it serves as a counterexample to the given assertion.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the Petersen graph can be a counterexample to the statement that &quot;Every graph G without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 subgraph is planar.&quot; Hmm. Let&#x27;s break this down step by step.

First, let me recall some basics. A planar graph is one that can be drawn on the plane without any edges crossing. Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem tells us that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K_5 (the complete graph on five vertices) or K_{3,3} (the complete bipartite graph on six vertices, split into two sets of three). However, the question here is about induced subgraphs, not subdivisions. So the original assertion is saying that if a graph doesn&#x27;t have K_{3,3} or K_5 as an induced subgraph, then it must be planar. If the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have these as induced subgraphs but is itself non-planar, then it would be a counterexample.

Alright, so let me recall the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s a well-known non-planar graph. I remember that it doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but wait, does it contain them as induced subgraphs? That&#x27;s the key here. The original assertion is about induced subgraphs, so even if the Petersen graph had a K_{3,3} or K_5 as a subgraph but not induced, it wouldn&#x27;t matter. The question is specifically about induced ones.

Let me confirm. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges. It&#x27;s a cubic graph (each vertex has degree 3). K_5 has 10 edges and is a complete graph, so each vertex has degree 4. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, it can&#x27;t contain K_5 as a subgraph because you can&#x27;t have a vertex with degree 4 in a cubic graph. Similarly, K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph with each vertex of degree 3. So maybe K_{3,3} could be a subgraph? But again, the question is about induced subgraphs.

An induced subgraph is a subset of the vertices of a graph together with all the edges whose endpoints are both in this subset. So even if the Petersen graph has a subgraph isomorphic to K_{3,3}, unless all the edges present in K_{3,3} between those vertices are also present in the Petersen graph, it&#x27;s not an induced subgraph.

Let me check if the Petersen graph contains an induced K_{3,3}. The Petersen graph is known to be non-planar, but according to Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem, it must contain a subdivision of K_5 or K_{3,3}. Indeed, the Petersen graph is a famous example of a non-planar graph that doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but it does contain a subdivision of K_{3,3}. However, a subdivision is different from an induced subgraph. Subdividing edges adds new vertices on the edges, so a subdivided K_{3,3} would not be an induced subgraph because the original edges are split into paths.

Therefore, the Petersen graph itself is non-planar, but does it contain an induced K_5 or K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s check K_5 first. As mentioned, all vertices in the Petersen graph have degree 3, but in K_5, every vertex has degree 4. So even if you take any 5 vertices in the Petersen graph, they can&#x27;t form a K_5 because the degrees are insufficient. So, there&#x27;s no induced K_5.

What about K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s see. K_{3,3} is bipartite, with two partitions each containing three vertices, and every vertex in one partition connected to every vertex in the other. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex has degree 3. If there was an induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph, each vertex in one partition would need to be connected to all three vertices in the other partition. But since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex can only have three edges. However, in K_{3,3}, each vertex is connected to three vertices in the opposite partition. So, if a vertex in the induced subgraph is part of the K_{3,3}, all its neighbors in the Petersen graph must be within the K_{3,3} as well. But in the Petersen graph, the neighborhoods are structured such that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let me try to visualize the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s usually drawn as a pentagon connected to a pentagram, with each vertex of the pentagon connected to a corresponding vertex of the pentagram. Each vertex is connected to three others: two in its own pentagon/pentagram and one in the other.

Suppose we try to find an induced K_{3,3}. Let&#x27;s take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices and one outer vertex. If we pick three outer vertices and three inner ones, perhaps we can form a bipartition. However, in the Petersen graph, each outer vertex is connected to only one inner vertex, and each inner vertex is connected to only one outer vertex. So, for example, if we take three outer vertices and their corresponding three inner vertices (each connected by a spoke), the edges between the outer and inner vertices would only be the three spokes. But in K_{3,3}, every outer vertex must connect to every inner vertex. In this case, each outer vertex is only connected to one inner vertex, so that&#x27;s only three edges between the partitions, whereas K_{3,3} would require nine edges (3x3). So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Alternatively, maybe if we select different sets of three vertices. Let me think. Since the Petersen graph is symmetric, any selection of six vertices should be similar. Suppose we try to find a bipartite induced subgraph with partitions of size three and three. The problem is that in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let&#x27;s say we pick three vertices from one partition. Each needs to be connected to all three in the other partition. But given the structure of the Petersen graph, each vertex is only connected to three others. If a vertex is in one partition, to connect to all three in the other partition, that would require three edges. But if the other partition has three vertices, each of those would need to connect back to all three in the first partition. However, each vertex in the other partition is already connected to two others in their own partition (if they are on the pentagon or pentagram) and one in the opposite. So they can&#x27;t have three edges to the first partition. Hence, it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph.

Therefore, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as an induced subgraph. Thus, it would serve as a counterexample to the assertion that every graph without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 is planar.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in reasoning about K_{3,3}. Let me try to see if there is a subset of six vertices in the Petersen graph that induce a K_{3,3}. Take the Petersen graph and label the outer pentagon vertices as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 and the inner pentagram vertices as u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, where each ui is connected to vi. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices (in the pentagram) and one outer vertex. So, suppose we take three outer vertices, say v1, v2, v3, and three inner vertices, say u4, u5, u1. Wait, u1 is connected to v1. Let&#x27;s see. The connections between the outer and inner vertices are only the spokes, so v1 is connected to u1, v2 to u2, etc. If we take v1, v2, v3 from the outer and u4, u5, u1 from the inner, then v1 is connected to u1, v2 is connected to u2 (which is not in the set), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set). So, in this subset, the only edges between the outer and inner are v1-u1. The rest of the edges would be the outer edges (v1-v2, v2-v3, v3-v4, etc.), but since we took only v1, v2, v3, the outer edges are v1-v2, v2-v3. The inner vertices u4, u5, u1: in the inner pentagram, u4 is connected to u5 and u3, but u3 isn&#x27;t in the set. u5 is connected to u4 and u1. u1 is connected to u5 and u2 (which isn&#x27;t in the set). So within the inner subset, u4 is connected to u5, u5 is connected to u1, and u1 is connected to no one else in the inner subset. So the induced subgraph on these six vertices would have edges: between outer vertices: v1-v2, v2-v3; between inner vertices: u4-u5, u5-u1; and the spoke edge v1-u1. That&#x27;s nothing like K_{3,3}; it&#x27;s missing almost all the edges.

Alternatively, pick six vertices in some other way. Maybe three from the outer and three from the inner, but not corresponding. For example, take v1, v3, v5 from the outer and u2, u4, u5 from the inner. Let&#x27;s check edges. The outer edges: v1 connected to v2 and v5 (but v2 and v5 are not in the set), so v1 only connected to v5. Wait, no, in the outer pentagon, v1 is connected to v2 and v5. But if we take v1, v3, v5, then v1 is connected to v5 (since they&#x27;re adjacent on the pentagon), v3 is connected to v4 and v2 (neither in the set), and v5 is connected to v1 and v4 (not in the set). So the outer subset has edges v1-v5. The inner subset u2, u4, u5: u2 is connected to u1 and u3 (not in the set), u4 is connected to u3 and u5, u5 is connected to u4 and u1 (not in the set). So u4-u5 is an edge. Between the outer and inner: v1 connected to u1 (not in the inner subset), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set), v5 connected to u5. So only v5-u5 is an edge. So the induced subgraph has edges v1-v5, u4-u5, and v5-u5. That&#x27;s just a triangle? Wait, no. v1 is connected to v5, v5 is connected to u5, and u5 is connected to u4. So it&#x27;s a path of three edges. Not K_{3,3}.

Hmm. Maybe trying different combinations. Alternatively, maybe pick vertices not all from outer and inner. Wait, but the Petersen graph is symmetric, so it shouldn&#x27;t matter. But perhaps if I pick vertices that form a 6-cycle or something. Wait, the Petersen graph has girth 5, so there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So any induced subgraph with a 6-cycle would have to be a hexagon, but the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have a 6-cycle. Wait, actually, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5 and 6? Wait, no, the girth is 5, meaning the shortest cycle is 5. So any cycle of length 6 would have to be a longer cycle. Wait, but can you even get a 6-cycle in the Petersen graph?

Wait, let me check. In the standard Petersen graph, if you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. The inner pentagram is also a 5-cycle. If you traverse the spokes, you can get longer cycles. For example, starting at v1, go to u1, then to u2, then to v2, then to v3, then to u3, then to u4, then to v4, etc. But I think the cycles are either of length 5 or longer. But does it have a 6-cycle? Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1, go to v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, back to v1. Wait, is that a cycle? v1 to v2 (outer edge), v2 to v3 (outer edge), v3 to u3 (spoke), u3 to u4 (inner edge), u4 to v4 (spoke), v4 to v1 (outer edge). That&#x27;s a 6-cycle: v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1. But wait, does this form a cycle? Let&#x27;s check the connections:

v1 adjacent to v2: yes.

v2 adjacent to v3: yes.

v3 adjacent to u3: yes.

u3 adjacent to u4: in the inner pentagon, u3 is adjacent to u4 and u2, yes.

u4 adjacent to v4: yes.

v4 adjacent to v1: yes, if in the outer pentagon, v4 is adjacent to v5 and v3. Wait, no. Wait, the outer pentagon is v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, with each adjacent to the next. So v4 is adjacent to v3 and v5. So v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, the path v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1 is not a cycle because v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, that&#x27;s a 6-vertex path, but not a cycle.

Hmm. So maybe there&#x27;s no 6-cycle in the Petersen graph. Wait, but according to some references, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5, 6, 8, and 9, but I need to confirm. Let me think. If you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. If you take the inner pentagram, that&#x27;s another 5-cycle. For a 6-cycle, maybe traverse spokes and inner edges. For example: v1, u1, u2, v2, v3, u3, v1. Wait, but that would be v1 connected to u1, u1 connected to u2, u2 connected to v2, v2 connected to v3, v3 connected to u3, u3 connected to v1? Wait, u3 is not connected to v1. So that doesn&#x27;t form a cycle. Alternatively, v1, u1, u5, v5, v4, u4, v1. Let&#x27;s check: v1-u1, u1-u5 (inner edge), u5-v5, v5-v4, v4-u4, u4 connected to v1? No, u4 is connected to v4 and u3. So no. So maybe that&#x27;s not a cycle.

Alternatively, maybe another path. Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1: v1, v2, u2, u3, v3, v4, v1. But v4 is not connected to v1. Hmm. Maybe it&#x27;s not possible. Wait, actually, according to the properties of the Petersen graph, it is a 3-regular graph with girth 5, so the shortest cycle is 5, and it doesn&#x27;t have cycles of length 3 or 4. So perhaps there are cycles of length 6, but they are not induced cycles. Because an induced cycle would require that there are no chords, but in a 6-cycle, if there are chords, it&#x27;s not induced. Given that the Petersen graph is 3-regular, adding chords might complicate things. But since the girth is 5, there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So, a 6-cycle would have to be chordless, which would make it an induced cycle. But does such a cycle exist?

Wait, in the Petersen graph, can we find a 6-cycle? Let me check online in my mind. I recall that the Petersen graph does have cycles of length 6, but they are not induced. Wait, if the girth is 5, then any 6-cycle must have a chord, making it non-induced. Therefore, there are no induced 6-cycles. Therefore, any 6-vertex induced subgraph cannot be a cycle. So, perhaps the induced subgraphs on six vertices in the Petersen graph are not bipartite. But K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph. So, if the induced subgraph is not bipartite, it can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. Alternatively, even if it&#x27;s bipartite, it needs to be complete.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s take a different approach. Let&#x27;s check all possible 6-vertex induced subgraphs of the Petersen graph. Since the Petersen graph is small, maybe this is feasible. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices, so the number of 6-vertex induced subgraphs is C(10,6) = 210. That&#x27;s a lot, but maybe we can reason about their properties.

In an induced subgraph of six vertices, each vertex can have degree at most 3 (since the original graph is 3-regular). For it to be K_{3,3}, each vertex in one partition must have degree 3, connected to all three vertices in the other partition. So in total, each partition has three vertices, and all 9 edges are present between them. But in the induced subgraph, we need to have exactly those edges and no others.

But in the Petersen graph, any two adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Wait, no. Wait, in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. That&#x27;s a key property. Let me confirm. In the Petersen graph, if two vertices are non-adjacent, they have exactly one common neighbor. If they are adjacent, they have no common neighbors. Because it&#x27;s a strongly regular graph with parameters (10,3,0,1), which means each pair of adjacent vertices has 0 common neighbors, and each pair of non-adjacent vertices has 1 common neighbor.

Therefore, in the induced subgraph, if two vertices are adjacent in the Petersen graph, they have no common neighbors in the entire graph, so also in the induced subgraph. If two vertices are non-adjacent in the induced subgraph, they could be adjacent or non-adjacent in the whole graph. But if they are non-adjacent in the whole graph, they have one common neighbor in the whole graph, but that common neighbor might not be in the induced subgraph.

But let&#x27;s consider trying to form K_{3,3}. Suppose we have partitions A and B, each with three vertices. In K_{3,3}, every vertex in A is connected to every vertex in B, and there are no edges within A or within B. So in the induced subgraph, there should be no edges within A or within B, and all edges between A and B.

But in the Petersen graph, edges are arranged such that the outer pentagon and inner pentagram each have their own edges. Let&#x27;s think of the standard drawing. If we pick three vertices from the outer pentagon, they form a path or something. Each is connected to two others in the pentagon. So if we include three outer vertices, they have edges among themselves, which would violate the requirement of K_{3,3} having no edges within a partition. Similarly, three inner vertices would have edges among themselves. Therefore, if we pick three from the outer and three from the inner, the induced subgraph would have edges within the outer three, edges within the inner three, and some edges between them. But K_{3,3} has no edges within partitions. Therefore, such a subgraph would have extra edges, so it wouldn&#x27;t be a K_{3,3}.

Alternatively, maybe pick six vertices not split as three outer and three inner. But the Petersen graph is symmetric, so any six vertices would have a similar structure. Wait, but how else can you partition six vertices? Maybe two from outer, two from inner, and two others? But since the graph is symmetric, perhaps the induced subgraphs would still have edges within their groups.

Alternatively, consider another approach: the complement of the Petersen graph. But maybe that&#x27;s not helpful here.

Wait, another property: K_{3,3} has nine edges. The induced subgraph would need to have nine edges. Let&#x27;s calculate the number of edges in a 6-vertex induced subgraph of the Petersen graph. Each vertex has degree 3, but when you take an induced subgraph, each vertex can have degree between 0 and 3. The total number of edges in the induced subgraph can be calculated by summing the degrees and dividing by 2, but since we&#x27;re dealing with induced subgraphs, it&#x27;s just the number of edges present between those six vertices.

But how many edges can there be? Let&#x27;s see. In the entire Petersen graph, there are 15 edges. If we take six vertices, the maximum number of edges they can have is C(6,2) = 15, but obviously, the induced subgraph will have fewer since the Petersen graph isn&#x27;t complete. Given the regularity and structure, how many edges would a 6-vertex induced subgraph have?

Alternatively, since each vertex has degree 3, in the induced subgraph, each vertex can have at most 3 edges. But since the graph is 3-regular, each vertex has 3 edges in the whole graph. So in the induced subgraph, the degree of a vertex is the number of its neighbors that are also in the subgraph. So the number of edges in the induced subgraph would be half the sum of the degrees of the vertices within the subgraph. Since each vertex can contribute 0 to 3 edges, the total number of edges could be up to (6*3)/2 = 9, which is the number of edges in K_{3,3}. But is there an induced subgraph with 9 edges?

For that, each vertex in the subgraph would need to have degree 3 in the subgraph. But since the original graph is 3-regular, if a vertex has all three neighbors inside the subgraph, then it contributes 3 to the sum. If a vertex has, say, two neighbors inside the subgraph, it contributes 2, etc.

So to have 9 edges, the sum of degrees must be 18, but since each edge is counted twice, 9 edges correspond to sum of degrees 18. Therefore, each of the six vertices must have degree 3 in the induced subgraph, meaning each vertex is connected to all three others in the subgraph. But that would mean the induced subgraph is a 3-regular graph on six vertices. However, the only 3-regular graph on six vertices is the complete bipartite graph K_{3,3}, which is bipartite, and the complete tripartite graph... Wait, no. The 3-regular graphs on six vertices include K_{3,3} and the prism graph (two triangles connected by a matching), also known as the triangular prism, which is a 3-regular graph but not bipartite. So there are two 3-regular graphs on six vertices: K_{3,3} and the prism graph.

Therefore, if the induced subgraph is 3-regular, it could be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But in the Petersen graph, can we find an induced subgraph that&#x27;s 3-regular on six vertices? Let&#x27;s check.

If such a subgraph exists, it would need to be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But given the properties of the Petersen graph, like any two non-adjacent vertices having exactly one common neighbor, let&#x27;s see if a 3-regular induced subgraph is possible.

Suppose we have six vertices forming an induced subgraph. If it&#x27;s K_{3,3}, then it&#x27;s bipartite with partitions A and B. Each vertex in A is connected to all in B, and there are no edges within A or B. But in the Petersen graph, if we take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram, as before, they have edges within their own partitions. So that can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. If we take six vertices in some other configuration, perhaps?

Wait, the prism graph (two triangles connected by edges) is another 3-regular graph on six vertices. Let&#x27;s see if that exists as an induced subgraph in the Petersen graph. The prism graph has two triangles, each triangle being a 3-cycle. But the Petersen graph has girth 5, so it has no 3-cycles. Therefore, the prism graph cannot be a subgraph of the Petersen graph, induced or otherwise. Therefore, the only possible 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices would be K_{3,3}. But since the prism graph is excluded due to the girth, and K_{3,3} would require no edges within each partition, but any three vertices in the Petersen graph would have edges among themselves if they are from the outer or inner cycles.

Therefore, it&#x27;s impossible to have a 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices in the Petersen graph. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph. Thus, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph without induced K_5 or K_{3,3}, making it a counterexample to the original assertion.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample to refute the assertion that &quot;Every graph \( G \) without an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \) subgraph is planar,&quot; we need to check the following:

1. **Planarity of the Petersen Graph**: The Petersen graph is a well-known non-planar graph.
2. **Induced Subgraphs**: We need to verify if the Petersen graph contains an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \).

**Key Points**:
- The Petersen graph is non-planar.
- The Petersen graph is cubic (each vertex has degree 3), so it cannot contain \( K_5 \) as a subgraph (since \( K_5 \) requires each vertex to have degree 4).
- The Petersen graph does not contain \( K_{3,3} \) as an induced subgraph. This is because any induced subgraph of six vertices in the Petersen graph cannot be bipartite with all edges present between the two partitions (as required for \( K_{3,3} \)). The structure of the Petersen graph, with its girth of 5 and the property that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor, prevents the existence of such an induced subgraph.

**Conclusion**:
The Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \). Therefore, it serves as a counterexample to the given assertion.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the Petersen graph can be a counterexample to the statement that &quot;Every graph G without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 subgraph is planar.&quot; Hmm. Let&#x27;s break this down step by step.

First, let me recall some basics. A planar graph is one that can be drawn on the plane without any edges crossing. Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem tells us that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K_5 (the complete graph on five vertices) or K_{3,3} (the complete bipartite graph on six vertices, split into two sets of three). However, the question here is about induced subgraphs, not subdivisions. So the original assertion is saying that if a graph doesn&#x27;t have K_{3,3} or K_5 as an induced subgraph, then it must be planar. If the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have these as induced subgraphs but is itself non-planar, then it would be a counterexample.

Alright, so let me recall the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s a well-known non-planar graph. I remember that it doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but wait, does it contain them as induced subgraphs? That&#x27;s the key here. The original assertion is about induced subgraphs, so even if the Petersen graph had a K_{3,3} or K_5 as a subgraph but not induced, it wouldn&#x27;t matter. The question is specifically about induced ones.

Let me confirm. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges. It&#x27;s a cubic graph (each vertex has degree 3). K_5 has 10 edges and is a complete graph, so each vertex has degree 4. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, it can&#x27;t contain K_5 as a subgraph because you can&#x27;t have a vertex with degree 4 in a cubic graph. Similarly, K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph with each vertex of degree 3. So maybe K_{3,3} could be a subgraph? But again, the question is about induced subgraphs.

An induced subgraph is a subset of the vertices of a graph together with all the edges whose endpoints are both in this subset. So even if the Petersen graph has a subgraph isomorphic to K_{3,3}, unless all the edges present in K_{3,3} between those vertices are also present in the Petersen graph, it&#x27;s not an induced subgraph.

Let me check if the Petersen graph contains an induced K_{3,3}. The Petersen graph is known to be non-planar, but according to Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem, it must contain a subdivision of K_5 or K_{3,3}. Indeed, the Petersen graph is a famous example of a non-planar graph that doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but it does contain a subdivision of K_{3,3}. However, a subdivision is different from an induced subgraph. Subdividing edges adds new vertices on the edges, so a subdivided K_{3,3} would not be an induced subgraph because the original edges are split into paths.

Therefore, the Petersen graph itself is non-planar, but does it contain an induced K_5 or K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s check K_5 first. As mentioned, all vertices in the Petersen graph have degree 3, but in K_5, every vertex has degree 4. So even if you take any 5 vertices in the Petersen graph, they can&#x27;t form a K_5 because the degrees are insufficient. So, there&#x27;s no induced K_5.

What about K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s see. K_{3,3} is bipartite, with two partitions each containing three vertices, and every vertex in one partition connected to every vertex in the other. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex has degree 3. If there was an induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph, each vertex in one partition would need to be connected to all three vertices in the other partition. But since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex can only have three edges. However, in K_{3,3}, each vertex is connected to three vertices in the opposite partition. So, if a vertex in the induced subgraph is part of the K_{3,3}, all its neighbors in the Petersen graph must be within the K_{3,3} as well. But in the Petersen graph, the neighborhoods are structured such that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let me try to visualize the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s usually drawn as a pentagon connected to a pentagram, with each vertex of the pentagon connected to a corresponding vertex of the pentagram. Each vertex is connected to three others: two in its own pentagon/pentagram and one in the other.

Suppose we try to find an induced K_{3,3}. Let&#x27;s take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices and one outer vertex. If we pick three outer vertices and three inner ones, perhaps we can form a bipartition. However, in the Petersen graph, each outer vertex is connected to only one inner vertex, and each inner vertex is connected to only one outer vertex. So, for example, if we take three outer vertices and their corresponding three inner vertices (each connected by a spoke), the edges between the outer and inner vertices would only be the three spokes. But in K_{3,3}, every outer vertex must connect to every inner vertex. In this case, each outer vertex is only connected to one inner vertex, so that&#x27;s only three edges between the partitions, whereas K_{3,3} would require nine edges (3x3). So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Alternatively, maybe if we select different sets of three vertices. Let me think. Since the Petersen graph is symmetric, any selection of six vertices should be similar. Suppose we try to find a bipartite induced subgraph with partitions of size three and three. The problem is that in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let&#x27;s say we pick three vertices from one partition. Each needs to be connected to all three in the other partition. But given the structure of the Petersen graph, each vertex is only connected to three others. If a vertex is in one partition, to connect to all three in the other partition, that would require three edges. But if the other partition has three vertices, each of those would need to connect back to all three in the first partition. However, each vertex in the other partition is already connected to two others in their own partition (if they are on the pentagon or pentagram) and one in the opposite. So they can&#x27;t have three edges to the first partition. Hence, it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph.

Therefore, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as an induced subgraph. Thus, it would serve as a counterexample to the assertion that every graph without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 is planar.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in reasoning about K_{3,3}. Let me try to see if there is a subset of six vertices in the Petersen graph that induce a K_{3,3}. Take the Petersen graph and label the outer pentagon vertices as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 and the inner pentagram vertices as u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, where each ui is connected to vi. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices (in the pentagram) and one outer vertex. So, suppose we take three outer vertices, say v1, v2, v3, and three inner vertices, say u4, u5, u1. Wait, u1 is connected to v1. Let&#x27;s see. The connections between the outer and inner vertices are only the spokes, so v1 is connected to u1, v2 to u2, etc. If we take v1, v2, v3 from the outer and u4, u5, u1 from the inner, then v1 is connected to u1, v2 is connected to u2 (which is not in the set), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set). So, in this subset, the only edges between the outer and inner are v1-u1. The rest of the edges would be the outer edges (v1-v2, v2-v3, v3-v4, etc.), but since we took only v1, v2, v3, the outer edges are v1-v2, v2-v3. The inner vertices u4, u5, u1: in the inner pentagram, u4 is connected to u5 and u3, but u3 isn&#x27;t in the set. u5 is connected to u4 and u1. u1 is connected to u5 and u2 (which isn&#x27;t in the set). So within the inner subset, u4 is connected to u5, u5 is connected to u1, and u1 is connected to no one else in the inner subset. So the induced subgraph on these six vertices would have edges: between outer vertices: v1-v2, v2-v3; between inner vertices: u4-u5, u5-u1; and the spoke edge v1-u1. That&#x27;s nothing like K_{3,3}; it&#x27;s missing almost all the edges.

Alternatively, pick six vertices in some other way. Maybe three from the outer and three from the inner, but not corresponding. For example, take v1, v3, v5 from the outer and u2, u4, u5 from the inner. Let&#x27;s check edges. The outer edges: v1 connected to v2 and v5 (but v2 and v5 are not in the set), so v1 only connected to v5. Wait, no, in the outer pentagon, v1 is connected to v2 and v5. But if we take v1, v3, v5, then v1 is connected to v5 (since they&#x27;re adjacent on the pentagon), v3 is connected to v4 and v2 (neither in the set), and v5 is connected to v1 and v4 (not in the set). So the outer subset has edges v1-v5. The inner subset u2, u4, u5: u2 is connected to u1 and u3 (not in the set), u4 is connected to u3 and u5, u5 is connected to u4 and u1 (not in the set). So u4-u5 is an edge. Between the outer and inner: v1 connected to u1 (not in the inner subset), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set), v5 connected to u5. So only v5-u5 is an edge. So the induced subgraph has edges v1-v5, u4-u5, and v5-u5. That&#x27;s just a triangle? Wait, no. v1 is connected to v5, v5 is connected to u5, and u5 is connected to u4. So it&#x27;s a path of three edges. Not K_{3,3}.

Hmm. Maybe trying different combinations. Alternatively, maybe pick vertices not all from outer and inner. Wait, but the Petersen graph is symmetric, so it shouldn&#x27;t matter. But perhaps if I pick vertices that form a 6-cycle or something. Wait, the Petersen graph has girth 5, so there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So any induced subgraph with a 6-cycle would have to be a hexagon, but the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have a 6-cycle. Wait, actually, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5 and 6? Wait, no, the girth is 5, meaning the shortest cycle is 5. So any cycle of length 6 would have to be a longer cycle. Wait, but can you even get a 6-cycle in the Petersen graph?

Wait, let me check. In the standard Petersen graph, if you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. The inner pentagram is also a 5-cycle. If you traverse the spokes, you can get longer cycles. For example, starting at v1, go to u1, then to u2, then to v2, then to v3, then to u3, then to u4, then to v4, etc. But I think the cycles are either of length 5 or longer. But does it have a 6-cycle? Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1, go to v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, back to v1. Wait, is that a cycle? v1 to v2 (outer edge), v2 to v3 (outer edge), v3 to u3 (spoke), u3 to u4 (inner edge), u4 to v4 (spoke), v4 to v1 (outer edge). That&#x27;s a 6-cycle: v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1. But wait, does this form a cycle? Let&#x27;s check the connections:

v1 adjacent to v2: yes.

v2 adjacent to v3: yes.

v3 adjacent to u3: yes.

u3 adjacent to u4: in the inner pentagon, u3 is adjacent to u4 and u2, yes.

u4 adjacent to v4: yes.

v4 adjacent to v1: yes, if in the outer pentagon, v4 is adjacent to v5 and v3. Wait, no. Wait, the outer pentagon is v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, with each adjacent to the next. So v4 is adjacent to v3 and v5. So v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, the path v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1 is not a cycle because v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, that&#x27;s a 6-vertex path, but not a cycle.

Hmm. So maybe there&#x27;s no 6-cycle in the Petersen graph. Wait, but according to some references, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5, 6, 8, and 9, but I need to confirm. Let me think. If you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. If you take the inner pentagram, that&#x27;s another 5-cycle. For a 6-cycle, maybe traverse spokes and inner edges. For example: v1, u1, u2, v2, v3, u3, v1. Wait, but that would be v1 connected to u1, u1 connected to u2, u2 connected to v2, v2 connected to v3, v3 connected to u3, u3 connected to v1? Wait, u3 is not connected to v1. So that doesn&#x27;t form a cycle. Alternatively, v1, u1, u5, v5, v4, u4, v1. Let&#x27;s check: v1-u1, u1-u5 (inner edge), u5-v5, v5-v4, v4-u4, u4 connected to v1? No, u4 is connected to v4 and u3. So no. So maybe that&#x27;s not a cycle.

Alternatively, maybe another path. Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1: v1, v2, u2, u3, v3, v4, v1. But v4 is not connected to v1. Hmm. Maybe it&#x27;s not possible. Wait, actually, according to the properties of the Petersen graph, it is a 3-regular graph with girth 5, so the shortest cycle is 5, and it doesn&#x27;t have cycles of length 3 or 4. So perhaps there are cycles of length 6, but they are not induced cycles. Because an induced cycle would require that there are no chords, but in a 6-cycle, if there are chords, it&#x27;s not induced. Given that the Petersen graph is 3-regular, adding chords might complicate things. But since the girth is 5, there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So, a 6-cycle would have to be chordless, which would make it an induced cycle. But does such a cycle exist?

Wait, in the Petersen graph, can we find a 6-cycle? Let me check online in my mind. I recall that the Petersen graph does have cycles of length 6, but they are not induced. Wait, if the girth is 5, then any 6-cycle must have a chord, making it non-induced. Therefore, there are no induced 6-cycles. Therefore, any 6-vertex induced subgraph cannot be a cycle. So, perhaps the induced subgraphs on six vertices in the Petersen graph are not bipartite. But K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph. So, if the induced subgraph is not bipartite, it can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. Alternatively, even if it&#x27;s bipartite, it needs to be complete.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s take a different approach. Let&#x27;s check all possible 6-vertex induced subgraphs of the Petersen graph. Since the Petersen graph is small, maybe this is feasible. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices, so the number of 6-vertex induced subgraphs is C(10,6) = 210. That&#x27;s a lot, but maybe we can reason about their properties.

In an induced subgraph of six vertices, each vertex can have degree at most 3 (since the original graph is 3-regular). For it to be K_{3,3}, each vertex in one partition must have degree 3, connected to all three vertices in the other partition. So in total, each partition has three vertices, and all 9 edges are present between them. But in the induced subgraph, we need to have exactly those edges and no others.

But in the Petersen graph, any two adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Wait, no. Wait, in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. That&#x27;s a key property. Let me confirm. In the Petersen graph, if two vertices are non-adjacent, they have exactly one common neighbor. If they are adjacent, they have no common neighbors. Because it&#x27;s a strongly regular graph with parameters (10,3,0,1), which means each pair of adjacent vertices has 0 common neighbors, and each pair of non-adjacent vertices has 1 common neighbor.

Therefore, in the induced subgraph, if two vertices are adjacent in the Petersen graph, they have no common neighbors in the entire graph, so also in the induced subgraph. If two vertices are non-adjacent in the induced subgraph, they could be adjacent or non-adjacent in the whole graph. But if they are non-adjacent in the whole graph, they have one common neighbor in the whole graph, but that common neighbor might not be in the induced subgraph.

But let&#x27;s consider trying to form K_{3,3}. Suppose we have partitions A and B, each with three vertices. In K_{3,3}, every vertex in A is connected to every vertex in B, and there are no edges within A or within B. So in the induced subgraph, there should be no edges within A or within B, and all edges between A and B.

But in the Petersen graph, edges are arranged such that the outer pentagon and inner pentagram each have their own edges. Let&#x27;s think of the standard drawing. If we pick three vertices from the outer pentagon, they form a path or something. Each is connected to two others in the pentagon. So if we include three outer vertices, they have edges among themselves, which would violate the requirement of K_{3,3} having no edges within a partition. Similarly, three inner vertices would have edges among themselves. Therefore, if we pick three from the outer and three from the inner, the induced subgraph would have edges within the outer three, edges within the inner three, and some edges between them. But K_{3,3} has no edges within partitions. Therefore, such a subgraph would have extra edges, so it wouldn&#x27;t be a K_{3,3}.

Alternatively, maybe pick six vertices not split as three outer and three inner. But the Petersen graph is symmetric, so any six vertices would have a similar structure. Wait, but how else can you partition six vertices? Maybe two from outer, two from inner, and two others? But since the graph is symmetric, perhaps the induced subgraphs would still have edges within their groups.

Alternatively, consider another approach: the complement of the Petersen graph. But maybe that&#x27;s not helpful here.

Wait, another property: K_{3,3} has nine edges. The induced subgraph would need to have nine edges. Let&#x27;s calculate the number of edges in a 6-vertex induced subgraph of the Petersen graph. Each vertex has degree 3, but when you take an induced subgraph, each vertex can have degree between 0 and 3. The total number of edges in the induced subgraph can be calculated by summing the degrees and dividing by 2, but since we&#x27;re dealing with induced subgraphs, it&#x27;s just the number of edges present between those six vertices.

But how many edges can there be? Let&#x27;s see. In the entire Petersen graph, there are 15 edges. If we take six vertices, the maximum number of edges they can have is C(6,2) = 15, but obviously, the induced subgraph will have fewer since the Petersen graph isn&#x27;t complete. Given the regularity and structure, how many edges would a 6-vertex induced subgraph have?

Alternatively, since each vertex has degree 3, in the induced subgraph, each vertex can have at most 3 edges. But since the graph is 3-regular, each vertex has 3 edges in the whole graph. So in the induced subgraph, the degree of a vertex is the number of its neighbors that are also in the subgraph. So the number of edges in the induced subgraph would be half the sum of the degrees of the vertices within the subgraph. Since each vertex can contribute 0 to 3 edges, the total number of edges could be up to (6*3)/2 = 9, which is the number of edges in K_{3,3}. But is there an induced subgraph with 9 edges?

For that, each vertex in the subgraph would need to have degree 3 in the subgraph. But since the original graph is 3-regular, if a vertex has all three neighbors inside the subgraph, then it contributes 3 to the sum. If a vertex has, say, two neighbors inside the subgraph, it contributes 2, etc.

So to have 9 edges, the sum of degrees must be 18, but since each edge is counted twice, 9 edges correspond to sum of degrees 18. Therefore, each of the six vertices must have degree 3 in the induced subgraph, meaning each vertex is connected to all three others in the subgraph. But that would mean the induced subgraph is a 3-regular graph on six vertices. However, the only 3-regular graph on six vertices is the complete bipartite graph K_{3,3}, which is bipartite, and the complete tripartite graph... Wait, no. The 3-regular graphs on six vertices include K_{3,3} and the prism graph (two triangles connected by a matching), also known as the triangular prism, which is a 3-regular graph but not bipartite. So there are two 3-regular graphs on six vertices: K_{3,3} and the prism graph.

Therefore, if the induced subgraph is 3-regular, it could be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But in the Petersen graph, can we find an induced subgraph that&#x27;s 3-regular on six vertices? Let&#x27;s check.

If such a subgraph exists, it would need to be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But given the properties of the Petersen graph, like any two non-adjacent vertices having exactly one common neighbor, let&#x27;s see if a 3-regular induced subgraph is possible.

Suppose we have six vertices forming an induced subgraph. If it&#x27;s K_{3,3}, then it&#x27;s bipartite with partitions A and B. Each vertex in A is connected to all in B, and there are no edges within A or B. But in the Petersen graph, if we take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram, as before, they have edges within their own partitions. So that can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. If we take six vertices in some other configuration, perhaps?

Wait, the prism graph (two triangles connected by edges) is another 3-regular graph on six vertices. Let&#x27;s see if that exists as an induced subgraph in the Petersen graph. The prism graph has two triangles, each triangle being a 3-cycle. But the Petersen graph has girth 5, so it has no 3-cycles. Therefore, the prism graph cannot be a subgraph of the Petersen graph, induced or otherwise. Therefore, the only possible 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices would be K_{3,3}. But since the prism graph is excluded due to the girth, and K_{3,3} would require no edges within each partition, but any three vertices in the Petersen graph would have edges among themselves if they are from the outer or inner cycles.

Therefore, it&#x27;s impossible to have a 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices in the Petersen graph. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph. Thus, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph without induced K_5 or K_{3,3}, making it a counterexample to the original assertion.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample to refute the assertion that &quot;Every graph \( G \) without an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \) subgraph is planar,&quot; we need to check the following:

1. **Planarity of the Petersen Graph**: The Petersen graph is a well-known non-planar graph.
2. **Induced Subgraphs**: We need to verify if the Petersen graph contains an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \).

**Key Points**:
- The Petersen graph is non-planar.
- The Petersen graph is cubic (each vertex has degree 3), so it cannot contain \( K_5 \) as a subgraph (since \( K_5 \) requires each vertex to have degree 4).
- The Petersen graph does not contain \( K_{3,3} \) as an induced subgraph. This is because any induced subgraph of six vertices in the Petersen graph cannot be bipartite with all edges present between the two partitions (as required for \( K_{3,3} \)). The structure of the Petersen graph, with its girth of 5 and the property that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor, prevents the existence of such an induced subgraph.

**Conclusion**:
The Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \). Therefore, it serves as a counterexample to the given assertion.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the Petersen graph can be a counterexample to the statement that &quot;Every graph G without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 subgraph is planar.&quot; Hmm. Let&#x27;s break this down step by step.

First, let me recall some basics. A planar graph is one that can be drawn on the plane without any edges crossing. Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem tells us that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K_5 (the complete graph on five vertices) or K_{3,3} (the complete bipartite graph on six vertices, split into two sets of three). However, the question here is about induced subgraphs, not subdivisions. So the original assertion is saying that if a graph doesn&#x27;t have K_{3,3} or K_5 as an induced subgraph, then it must be planar. If the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have these as induced subgraphs but is itself non-planar, then it would be a counterexample.

Alright, so let me recall the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s a well-known non-planar graph. I remember that it doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but wait, does it contain them as induced subgraphs? That&#x27;s the key here. The original assertion is about induced subgraphs, so even if the Petersen graph had a K_{3,3} or K_5 as a subgraph but not induced, it wouldn&#x27;t matter. The question is specifically about induced ones.

Let me confirm. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges. It&#x27;s a cubic graph (each vertex has degree 3). K_5 has 10 edges and is a complete graph, so each vertex has degree 4. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, it can&#x27;t contain K_5 as a subgraph because you can&#x27;t have a vertex with degree 4 in a cubic graph. Similarly, K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph with each vertex of degree 3. So maybe K_{3,3} could be a subgraph? But again, the question is about induced subgraphs.

An induced subgraph is a subset of the vertices of a graph together with all the edges whose endpoints are both in this subset. So even if the Petersen graph has a subgraph isomorphic to K_{3,3}, unless all the edges present in K_{3,3} between those vertices are also present in the Petersen graph, it&#x27;s not an induced subgraph.

Let me check if the Petersen graph contains an induced K_{3,3}. The Petersen graph is known to be non-planar, but according to Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem, it must contain a subdivision of K_5 or K_{3,3}. Indeed, the Petersen graph is a famous example of a non-planar graph that doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but it does contain a subdivision of K_{3,3}. However, a subdivision is different from an induced subgraph. Subdividing edges adds new vertices on the edges, so a subdivided K_{3,3} would not be an induced subgraph because the original edges are split into paths.

Therefore, the Petersen graph itself is non-planar, but does it contain an induced K_5 or K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s check K_5 first. As mentioned, all vertices in the Petersen graph have degree 3, but in K_5, every vertex has degree 4. So even if you take any 5 vertices in the Petersen graph, they can&#x27;t form a K_5 because the degrees are insufficient. So, there&#x27;s no induced K_5.

What about K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s see. K_{3,3} is bipartite, with two partitions each containing three vertices, and every vertex in one partition connected to every vertex in the other. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex has degree 3. If there was an induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph, each vertex in one partition would need to be connected to all three vertices in the other partition. But since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex can only have three edges. However, in K_{3,3}, each vertex is connected to three vertices in the opposite partition. So, if a vertex in the induced subgraph is part of the K_{3,3}, all its neighbors in the Petersen graph must be within the K_{3,3} as well. But in the Petersen graph, the neighborhoods are structured such that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let me try to visualize the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s usually drawn as a pentagon connected to a pentagram, with each vertex of the pentagon connected to a corresponding vertex of the pentagram. Each vertex is connected to three others: two in its own pentagon/pentagram and one in the other.

Suppose we try to find an induced K_{3,3}. Let&#x27;s take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices and one outer vertex. If we pick three outer vertices and three inner ones, perhaps we can form a bipartition. However, in the Petersen graph, each outer vertex is connected to only one inner vertex, and each inner vertex is connected to only one outer vertex. So, for example, if we take three outer vertices and their corresponding three inner vertices (each connected by a spoke), the edges between the outer and inner vertices would only be the three spokes. But in K_{3,3}, every outer vertex must connect to every inner vertex. In this case, each outer vertex is only connected to one inner vertex, so that&#x27;s only three edges between the partitions, whereas K_{3,3} would require nine edges (3x3). So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Alternatively, maybe if we select different sets of three vertices. Let me think. Since the Petersen graph is symmetric, any selection of six vertices should be similar. Suppose we try to find a bipartite induced subgraph with partitions of size three and three. The problem is that in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let&#x27;s say we pick three vertices from one partition. Each needs to be connected to all three in the other partition. But given the structure of the Petersen graph, each vertex is only connected to three others. If a vertex is in one partition, to connect to all three in the other partition, that would require three edges. But if the other partition has three vertices, each of those would need to connect back to all three in the first partition. However, each vertex in the other partition is already connected to two others in their own partition (if they are on the pentagon or pentagram) and one in the opposite. So they can&#x27;t have three edges to the first partition. Hence, it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph.

Therefore, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as an induced subgraph. Thus, it would serve as a counterexample to the assertion that every graph without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 is planar.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in reasoning about K_{3,3}. Let me try to see if there is a subset of six vertices in the Petersen graph that induce a K_{3,3}. Take the Petersen graph and label the outer pentagon vertices as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 and the inner pentagram vertices as u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, where each ui is connected to vi. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices (in the pentagram) and one outer vertex. So, suppose we take three outer vertices, say v1, v2, v3, and three inner vertices, say u4, u5, u1. Wait, u1 is connected to v1. Let&#x27;s see. The connections between the outer and inner vertices are only the spokes, so v1 is connected to u1, v2 to u2, etc. If we take v1, v2, v3 from the outer and u4, u5, u1 from the inner, then v1 is connected to u1, v2 is connected to u2 (which is not in the set), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set). So, in this subset, the only edges between the outer and inner are v1-u1. The rest of the edges would be the outer edges (v1-v2, v2-v3, v3-v4, etc.), but since we took only v1, v2, v3, the outer edges are v1-v2, v2-v3. The inner vertices u4, u5, u1: in the inner pentagram, u4 is connected to u5 and u3, but u3 isn&#x27;t in the set. u5 is connected to u4 and u1. u1 is connected to u5 and u2 (which isn&#x27;t in the set). So within the inner subset, u4 is connected to u5, u5 is connected to u1, and u1 is connected to no one else in the inner subset. So the induced subgraph on these six vertices would have edges: between outer vertices: v1-v2, v2-v3; between inner vertices: u4-u5, u5-u1; and the spoke edge v1-u1. That&#x27;s nothing like K_{3,3}; it&#x27;s missing almost all the edges.

Alternatively, pick six vertices in some other way. Maybe three from the outer and three from the inner, but not corresponding. For example, take v1, v3, v5 from the outer and u2, u4, u5 from the inner. Let&#x27;s check edges. The outer edges: v1 connected to v2 and v5 (but v2 and v5 are not in the set), so v1 only connected to v5. Wait, no, in the outer pentagon, v1 is connected to v2 and v5. But if we take v1, v3, v5, then v1 is connected to v5 (since they&#x27;re adjacent on the pentagon), v3 is connected to v4 and v2 (neither in the set), and v5 is connected to v1 and v4 (not in the set). So the outer subset has edges v1-v5. The inner subset u2, u4, u5: u2 is connected to u1 and u3 (not in the set), u4 is connected to u3 and u5, u5 is connected to u4 and u1 (not in the set). So u4-u5 is an edge. Between the outer and inner: v1 connected to u1 (not in the inner subset), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set), v5 connected to u5. So only v5-u5 is an edge. So the induced subgraph has edges v1-v5, u4-u5, and v5-u5. That&#x27;s just a triangle? Wait, no. v1 is connected to v5, v5 is connected to u5, and u5 is connected to u4. So it&#x27;s a path of three edges. Not K_{3,3}.

Hmm. Maybe trying different combinations. Alternatively, maybe pick vertices not all from outer and inner. Wait, but the Petersen graph is symmetric, so it shouldn&#x27;t matter. But perhaps if I pick vertices that form a 6-cycle or something. Wait, the Petersen graph has girth 5, so there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So any induced subgraph with a 6-cycle would have to be a hexagon, but the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have a 6-cycle. Wait, actually, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5 and 6? Wait, no, the girth is 5, meaning the shortest cycle is 5. So any cycle of length 6 would have to be a longer cycle. Wait, but can you even get a 6-cycle in the Petersen graph?

Wait, let me check. In the standard Petersen graph, if you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. The inner pentagram is also a 5-cycle. If you traverse the spokes, you can get longer cycles. For example, starting at v1, go to u1, then to u2, then to v2, then to v3, then to u3, then to u4, then to v4, etc. But I think the cycles are either of length 5 or longer. But does it have a 6-cycle? Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1, go to v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, back to v1. Wait, is that a cycle? v1 to v2 (outer edge), v2 to v3 (outer edge), v3 to u3 (spoke), u3 to u4 (inner edge), u4 to v4 (spoke), v4 to v1 (outer edge). That&#x27;s a 6-cycle: v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1. But wait, does this form a cycle? Let&#x27;s check the connections:

v1 adjacent to v2: yes.

v2 adjacent to v3: yes.

v3 adjacent to u3: yes.

u3 adjacent to u4: in the inner pentagon, u3 is adjacent to u4 and u2, yes.

u4 adjacent to v4: yes.

v4 adjacent to v1: yes, if in the outer pentagon, v4 is adjacent to v5 and v3. Wait, no. Wait, the outer pentagon is v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, with each adjacent to the next. So v4 is adjacent to v3 and v5. So v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, the path v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1 is not a cycle because v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, that&#x27;s a 6-vertex path, but not a cycle.

Hmm. So maybe there&#x27;s no 6-cycle in the Petersen graph. Wait, but according to some references, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5, 6, 8, and 9, but I need to confirm. Let me think. If you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. If you take the inner pentagram, that&#x27;s another 5-cycle. For a 6-cycle, maybe traverse spokes and inner edges. For example: v1, u1, u2, v2, v3, u3, v1. Wait, but that would be v1 connected to u1, u1 connected to u2, u2 connected to v2, v2 connected to v3, v3 connected to u3, u3 connected to v1? Wait, u3 is not connected to v1. So that doesn&#x27;t form a cycle. Alternatively, v1, u1, u5, v5, v4, u4, v1. Let&#x27;s check: v1-u1, u1-u5 (inner edge), u5-v5, v5-v4, v4-u4, u4 connected to v1? No, u4 is connected to v4 and u3. So no. So maybe that&#x27;s not a cycle.

Alternatively, maybe another path. Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1: v1, v2, u2, u3, v3, v4, v1. But v4 is not connected to v1. Hmm. Maybe it&#x27;s not possible. Wait, actually, according to the properties of the Petersen graph, it is a 3-regular graph with girth 5, so the shortest cycle is 5, and it doesn&#x27;t have cycles of length 3 or 4. So perhaps there are cycles of length 6, but they are not induced cycles. Because an induced cycle would require that there are no chords, but in a 6-cycle, if there are chords, it&#x27;s not induced. Given that the Petersen graph is 3-regular, adding chords might complicate things. But since the girth is 5, there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So, a 6-cycle would have to be chordless, which would make it an induced cycle. But does such a cycle exist?

Wait, in the Petersen graph, can we find a 6-cycle? Let me check online in my mind. I recall that the Petersen graph does have cycles of length 6, but they are not induced. Wait, if the girth is 5, then any 6-cycle must have a chord, making it non-induced. Therefore, there are no induced 6-cycles. Therefore, any 6-vertex induced subgraph cannot be a cycle. So, perhaps the induced subgraphs on six vertices in the Petersen graph are not bipartite. But K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph. So, if the induced subgraph is not bipartite, it can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. Alternatively, even if it&#x27;s bipartite, it needs to be complete.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s take a different approach. Let&#x27;s check all possible 6-vertex induced subgraphs of the Petersen graph. Since the Petersen graph is small, maybe this is feasible. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices, so the number of 6-vertex induced subgraphs is C(10,6) = 210. That&#x27;s a lot, but maybe we can reason about their properties.

In an induced subgraph of six vertices, each vertex can have degree at most 3 (since the original graph is 3-regular). For it to be K_{3,3}, each vertex in one partition must have degree 3, connected to all three vertices in the other partition. So in total, each partition has three vertices, and all 9 edges are present between them. But in the induced subgraph, we need to have exactly those edges and no others.

But in the Petersen graph, any two adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Wait, no. Wait, in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. That&#x27;s a key property. Let me confirm. In the Petersen graph, if two vertices are non-adjacent, they have exactly one common neighbor. If they are adjacent, they have no common neighbors. Because it&#x27;s a strongly regular graph with parameters (10,3,0,1), which means each pair of adjacent vertices has 0 common neighbors, and each pair of non-adjacent vertices has 1 common neighbor.

Therefore, in the induced subgraph, if two vertices are adjacent in the Petersen graph, they have no common neighbors in the entire graph, so also in the induced subgraph. If two vertices are non-adjacent in the induced subgraph, they could be adjacent or non-adjacent in the whole graph. But if they are non-adjacent in the whole graph, they have one common neighbor in the whole graph, but that common neighbor might not be in the induced subgraph.

But let&#x27;s consider trying to form K_{3,3}. Suppose we have partitions A and B, each with three vertices. In K_{3,3}, every vertex in A is connected to every vertex in B, and there are no edges within A or within B. So in the induced subgraph, there should be no edges within A or within B, and all edges between A and B.

But in the Petersen graph, edges are arranged such that the outer pentagon and inner pentagram each have their own edges. Let&#x27;s think of the standard drawing. If we pick three vertices from the outer pentagon, they form a path or something. Each is connected to two others in the pentagon. So if we include three outer vertices, they have edges among themselves, which would violate the requirement of K_{3,3} having no edges within a partition. Similarly, three inner vertices would have edges among themselves. Therefore, if we pick three from the outer and three from the inner, the induced subgraph would have edges within the outer three, edges within the inner three, and some edges between them. But K_{3,3} has no edges within partitions. Therefore, such a subgraph would have extra edges, so it wouldn&#x27;t be a K_{3,3}.

Alternatively, maybe pick six vertices not split as three outer and three inner. But the Petersen graph is symmetric, so any six vertices would have a similar structure. Wait, but how else can you partition six vertices? Maybe two from outer, two from inner, and two others? But since the graph is symmetric, perhaps the induced subgraphs would still have edges within their groups.

Alternatively, consider another approach: the complement of the Petersen graph. But maybe that&#x27;s not helpful here.

Wait, another property: K_{3,3} has nine edges. The induced subgraph would need to have nine edges. Let&#x27;s calculate the number of edges in a 6-vertex induced subgraph of the Petersen graph. Each vertex has degree 3, but when you take an induced subgraph, each vertex can have degree between 0 and 3. The total number of edges in the induced subgraph can be calculated by summing the degrees and dividing by 2, but since we&#x27;re dealing with induced subgraphs, it&#x27;s just the number of edges present between those six vertices.

But how many edges can there be? Let&#x27;s see. In the entire Petersen graph, there are 15 edges. If we take six vertices, the maximum number of edges they can have is C(6,2) = 15, but obviously, the induced subgraph will have fewer since the Petersen graph isn&#x27;t complete. Given the regularity and structure, how many edges would a 6-vertex induced subgraph have?

Alternatively, since each vertex has degree 3, in the induced subgraph, each vertex can have at most 3 edges. But since the graph is 3-regular, each vertex has 3 edges in the whole graph. So in the induced subgraph, the degree of a vertex is the number of its neighbors that are also in the subgraph. So the number of edges in the induced subgraph would be half the sum of the degrees of the vertices within the subgraph. Since each vertex can contribute 0 to 3 edges, the total number of edges could be up to (6*3)/2 = 9, which is the number of edges in K_{3,3}. But is there an induced subgraph with 9 edges?

For that, each vertex in the subgraph would need to have degree 3 in the subgraph. But since the original graph is 3-regular, if a vertex has all three neighbors inside the subgraph, then it contributes 3 to the sum. If a vertex has, say, two neighbors inside the subgraph, it contributes 2, etc.

So to have 9 edges, the sum of degrees must be 18, but since each edge is counted twice, 9 edges correspond to sum of degrees 18. Therefore, each of the six vertices must have degree 3 in the induced subgraph, meaning each vertex is connected to all three others in the subgraph. But that would mean the induced subgraph is a 3-regular graph on six vertices. However, the only 3-regular graph on six vertices is the complete bipartite graph K_{3,3}, which is bipartite, and the complete tripartite graph... Wait, no. The 3-regular graphs on six vertices include K_{3,3} and the prism graph (two triangles connected by a matching), also known as the triangular prism, which is a 3-regular graph but not bipartite. So there are two 3-regular graphs on six vertices: K_{3,3} and the prism graph.

Therefore, if the induced subgraph is 3-regular, it could be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But in the Petersen graph, can we find an induced subgraph that&#x27;s 3-regular on six vertices? Let&#x27;s check.

If such a subgraph exists, it would need to be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But given the properties of the Petersen graph, like any two non-adjacent vertices having exactly one common neighbor, let&#x27;s see if a 3-regular induced subgraph is possible.

Suppose we have six vertices forming an induced subgraph. If it&#x27;s K_{3,3}, then it&#x27;s bipartite with partitions A and B. Each vertex in A is connected to all in B, and there are no edges within A or B. But in the Petersen graph, if we take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram, as before, they have edges within their own partitions. So that can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. If we take six vertices in some other configuration, perhaps?

Wait, the prism graph (two triangles connected by edges) is another 3-regular graph on six vertices. Let&#x27;s see if that exists as an induced subgraph in the Petersen graph. The prism graph has two triangles, each triangle being a 3-cycle. But the Petersen graph has girth 5, so it has no 3-cycles. Therefore, the prism graph cannot be a subgraph of the Petersen graph, induced or otherwise. Therefore, the only possible 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices would be K_{3,3}. But since the prism graph is excluded due to the girth, and K_{3,3} would require no edges within each partition, but any three vertices in the Petersen graph would have edges among themselves if they are from the outer or inner cycles.

Therefore, it&#x27;s impossible to have a 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices in the Petersen graph. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph. Thus, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph without induced K_5 or K_{3,3}, making it a counterexample to the original assertion.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample to refute the assertion that &quot;Every graph \( G \) without an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \) subgraph is planar,&quot; we need to check the following:

1. **Planarity of the Petersen Graph**: The Petersen graph is a well-known non-planar graph.
2. **Induced Subgraphs**: We need to verify if the Petersen graph contains an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \).

**Key Points**:
- The Petersen graph is non-planar.
- The Petersen graph is cubic (each vertex has degree 3), so it cannot contain \( K_5 \) as a subgraph (since \( K_5 \) requires each vertex to have degree 4).
- The Petersen graph does not contain \( K_{3,3} \) as an induced subgraph. This is because any induced subgraph of six vertices in the Petersen graph cannot be bipartite with all edges present between the two partitions (as required for \( K_{3,3} \)). The structure of the Petersen graph, with its girth of 5 and the property that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor, prevents the existence of such an induced subgraph.

**Conclusion**:
The Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \). Therefore, it serves as a counterexample to the given assertion.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the Petersen graph can be a counterexample to the statement that &quot;Every graph G without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 subgraph is planar.&quot; Hmm. Let&#x27;s break this down step by step.

First, let me recall some basics. A planar graph is one that can be drawn on the plane without any edges crossing. Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem tells us that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K_5 (the complete graph on five vertices) or K_{3,3} (the complete bipartite graph on six vertices, split into two sets of three). However, the question here is about induced subgraphs, not subdivisions. So the original assertion is saying that if a graph doesn&#x27;t have K_{3,3} or K_5 as an induced subgraph, then it must be planar. If the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have these as induced subgraphs but is itself non-planar, then it would be a counterexample.

Alright, so let me recall the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s a well-known non-planar graph. I remember that it doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but wait, does it contain them as induced subgraphs? That&#x27;s the key here. The original assertion is about induced subgraphs, so even if the Petersen graph had a K_{3,3} or K_5 as a subgraph but not induced, it wouldn&#x27;t matter. The question is specifically about induced ones.

Let me confirm. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges. It&#x27;s a cubic graph (each vertex has degree 3). K_5 has 10 edges and is a complete graph, so each vertex has degree 4. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, it can&#x27;t contain K_5 as a subgraph because you can&#x27;t have a vertex with degree 4 in a cubic graph. Similarly, K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph with each vertex of degree 3. So maybe K_{3,3} could be a subgraph? But again, the question is about induced subgraphs.

An induced subgraph is a subset of the vertices of a graph together with all the edges whose endpoints are both in this subset. So even if the Petersen graph has a subgraph isomorphic to K_{3,3}, unless all the edges present in K_{3,3} between those vertices are also present in the Petersen graph, it&#x27;s not an induced subgraph.

Let me check if the Petersen graph contains an induced K_{3,3}. The Petersen graph is known to be non-planar, but according to Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem, it must contain a subdivision of K_5 or K_{3,3}. Indeed, the Petersen graph is a famous example of a non-planar graph that doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but it does contain a subdivision of K_{3,3}. However, a subdivision is different from an induced subgraph. Subdividing edges adds new vertices on the edges, so a subdivided K_{3,3} would not be an induced subgraph because the original edges are split into paths.

Therefore, the Petersen graph itself is non-planar, but does it contain an induced K_5 or K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s check K_5 first. As mentioned, all vertices in the Petersen graph have degree 3, but in K_5, every vertex has degree 4. So even if you take any 5 vertices in the Petersen graph, they can&#x27;t form a K_5 because the degrees are insufficient. So, there&#x27;s no induced K_5.

What about K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s see. K_{3,3} is bipartite, with two partitions each containing three vertices, and every vertex in one partition connected to every vertex in the other. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex has degree 3. If there was an induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph, each vertex in one partition would need to be connected to all three vertices in the other partition. But since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex can only have three edges. However, in K_{3,3}, each vertex is connected to three vertices in the opposite partition. So, if a vertex in the induced subgraph is part of the K_{3,3}, all its neighbors in the Petersen graph must be within the K_{3,3} as well. But in the Petersen graph, the neighborhoods are structured such that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let me try to visualize the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s usually drawn as a pentagon connected to a pentagram, with each vertex of the pentagon connected to a corresponding vertex of the pentagram. Each vertex is connected to three others: two in its own pentagon/pentagram and one in the other.

Suppose we try to find an induced K_{3,3}. Let&#x27;s take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices and one outer vertex. If we pick three outer vertices and three inner ones, perhaps we can form a bipartition. However, in the Petersen graph, each outer vertex is connected to only one inner vertex, and each inner vertex is connected to only one outer vertex. So, for example, if we take three outer vertices and their corresponding three inner vertices (each connected by a spoke), the edges between the outer and inner vertices would only be the three spokes. But in K_{3,3}, every outer vertex must connect to every inner vertex. In this case, each outer vertex is only connected to one inner vertex, so that&#x27;s only three edges between the partitions, whereas K_{3,3} would require nine edges (3x3). So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Alternatively, maybe if we select different sets of three vertices. Let me think. Since the Petersen graph is symmetric, any selection of six vertices should be similar. Suppose we try to find a bipartite induced subgraph with partitions of size three and three. The problem is that in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let&#x27;s say we pick three vertices from one partition. Each needs to be connected to all three in the other partition. But given the structure of the Petersen graph, each vertex is only connected to three others. If a vertex is in one partition, to connect to all three in the other partition, that would require three edges. But if the other partition has three vertices, each of those would need to connect back to all three in the first partition. However, each vertex in the other partition is already connected to two others in their own partition (if they are on the pentagon or pentagram) and one in the opposite. So they can&#x27;t have three edges to the first partition. Hence, it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph.

Therefore, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as an induced subgraph. Thus, it would serve as a counterexample to the assertion that every graph without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 is planar.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in reasoning about K_{3,3}. Let me try to see if there is a subset of six vertices in the Petersen graph that induce a K_{3,3}. Take the Petersen graph and label the outer pentagon vertices as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 and the inner pentagram vertices as u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, where each ui is connected to vi. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices (in the pentagram) and one outer vertex. So, suppose we take three outer vertices, say v1, v2, v3, and three inner vertices, say u4, u5, u1. Wait, u1 is connected to v1. Let&#x27;s see. The connections between the outer and inner vertices are only the spokes, so v1 is connected to u1, v2 to u2, etc. If we take v1, v2, v3 from the outer and u4, u5, u1 from the inner, then v1 is connected to u1, v2 is connected to u2 (which is not in the set), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set). So, in this subset, the only edges between the outer and inner are v1-u1. The rest of the edges would be the outer edges (v1-v2, v2-v3, v3-v4, etc.), but since we took only v1, v2, v3, the outer edges are v1-v2, v2-v3. The inner vertices u4, u5, u1: in the inner pentagram, u4 is connected to u5 and u3, but u3 isn&#x27;t in the set. u5 is connected to u4 and u1. u1 is connected to u5 and u2 (which isn&#x27;t in the set). So within the inner subset, u4 is connected to u5, u5 is connected to u1, and u1 is connected to no one else in the inner subset. So the induced subgraph on these six vertices would have edges: between outer vertices: v1-v2, v2-v3; between inner vertices: u4-u5, u5-u1; and the spoke edge v1-u1. That&#x27;s nothing like K_{3,3}; it&#x27;s missing almost all the edges.

Alternatively, pick six vertices in some other way. Maybe three from the outer and three from the inner, but not corresponding. For example, take v1, v3, v5 from the outer and u2, u4, u5 from the inner. Let&#x27;s check edges. The outer edges: v1 connected to v2 and v5 (but v2 and v5 are not in the set), so v1 only connected to v5. Wait, no, in the outer pentagon, v1 is connected to v2 and v5. But if we take v1, v3, v5, then v1 is connected to v5 (since they&#x27;re adjacent on the pentagon), v3 is connected to v4 and v2 (neither in the set), and v5 is connected to v1 and v4 (not in the set). So the outer subset has edges v1-v5. The inner subset u2, u4, u5: u2 is connected to u1 and u3 (not in the set), u4 is connected to u3 and u5, u5 is connected to u4 and u1 (not in the set). So u4-u5 is an edge. Between the outer and inner: v1 connected to u1 (not in the inner subset), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set), v5 connected to u5. So only v5-u5 is an edge. So the induced subgraph has edges v1-v5, u4-u5, and v5-u5. That&#x27;s just a triangle? Wait, no. v1 is connected to v5, v5 is connected to u5, and u5 is connected to u4. So it&#x27;s a path of three edges. Not K_{3,3}.

Hmm. Maybe trying different combinations. Alternatively, maybe pick vertices not all from outer and inner. Wait, but the Petersen graph is symmetric, so it shouldn&#x27;t matter. But perhaps if I pick vertices that form a 6-cycle or something. Wait, the Petersen graph has girth 5, so there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So any induced subgraph with a 6-cycle would have to be a hexagon, but the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have a 6-cycle. Wait, actually, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5 and 6? Wait, no, the girth is 5, meaning the shortest cycle is 5. So any cycle of length 6 would have to be a longer cycle. Wait, but can you even get a 6-cycle in the Petersen graph?

Wait, let me check. In the standard Petersen graph, if you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. The inner pentagram is also a 5-cycle. If you traverse the spokes, you can get longer cycles. For example, starting at v1, go to u1, then to u2, then to v2, then to v3, then to u3, then to u4, then to v4, etc. But I think the cycles are either of length 5 or longer. But does it have a 6-cycle? Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1, go to v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, back to v1. Wait, is that a cycle? v1 to v2 (outer edge), v2 to v3 (outer edge), v3 to u3 (spoke), u3 to u4 (inner edge), u4 to v4 (spoke), v4 to v1 (outer edge). That&#x27;s a 6-cycle: v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1. But wait, does this form a cycle? Let&#x27;s check the connections:

v1 adjacent to v2: yes.

v2 adjacent to v3: yes.

v3 adjacent to u3: yes.

u3 adjacent to u4: in the inner pentagon, u3 is adjacent to u4 and u2, yes.

u4 adjacent to v4: yes.

v4 adjacent to v1: yes, if in the outer pentagon, v4 is adjacent to v5 and v3. Wait, no. Wait, the outer pentagon is v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, with each adjacent to the next. So v4 is adjacent to v3 and v5. So v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, the path v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1 is not a cycle because v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, that&#x27;s a 6-vertex path, but not a cycle.

Hmm. So maybe there&#x27;s no 6-cycle in the Petersen graph. Wait, but according to some references, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5, 6, 8, and 9, but I need to confirm. Let me think. If you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. If you take the inner pentagram, that&#x27;s another 5-cycle. For a 6-cycle, maybe traverse spokes and inner edges. For example: v1, u1, u2, v2, v3, u3, v1. Wait, but that would be v1 connected to u1, u1 connected to u2, u2 connected to v2, v2 connected to v3, v3 connected to u3, u3 connected to v1? Wait, u3 is not connected to v1. So that doesn&#x27;t form a cycle. Alternatively, v1, u1, u5, v5, v4, u4, v1. Let&#x27;s check: v1-u1, u1-u5 (inner edge), u5-v5, v5-v4, v4-u4, u4 connected to v1? No, u4 is connected to v4 and u3. So no. So maybe that&#x27;s not a cycle.

Alternatively, maybe another path. Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1: v1, v2, u2, u3, v3, v4, v1. But v4 is not connected to v1. Hmm. Maybe it&#x27;s not possible. Wait, actually, according to the properties of the Petersen graph, it is a 3-regular graph with girth 5, so the shortest cycle is 5, and it doesn&#x27;t have cycles of length 3 or 4. So perhaps there are cycles of length 6, but they are not induced cycles. Because an induced cycle would require that there are no chords, but in a 6-cycle, if there are chords, it&#x27;s not induced. Given that the Petersen graph is 3-regular, adding chords might complicate things. But since the girth is 5, there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So, a 6-cycle would have to be chordless, which would make it an induced cycle. But does such a cycle exist?

Wait, in the Petersen graph, can we find a 6-cycle? Let me check online in my mind. I recall that the Petersen graph does have cycles of length 6, but they are not induced. Wait, if the girth is 5, then any 6-cycle must have a chord, making it non-induced. Therefore, there are no induced 6-cycles. Therefore, any 6-vertex induced subgraph cannot be a cycle. So, perhaps the induced subgraphs on six vertices in the Petersen graph are not bipartite. But K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph. So, if the induced subgraph is not bipartite, it can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. Alternatively, even if it&#x27;s bipartite, it needs to be complete.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s take a different approach. Let&#x27;s check all possible 6-vertex induced subgraphs of the Petersen graph. Since the Petersen graph is small, maybe this is feasible. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices, so the number of 6-vertex induced subgraphs is C(10,6) = 210. That&#x27;s a lot, but maybe we can reason about their properties.

In an induced subgraph of six vertices, each vertex can have degree at most 3 (since the original graph is 3-regular). For it to be K_{3,3}, each vertex in one partition must have degree 3, connected to all three vertices in the other partition. So in total, each partition has three vertices, and all 9 edges are present between them. But in the induced subgraph, we need to have exactly those edges and no others.

But in the Petersen graph, any two adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Wait, no. Wait, in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. That&#x27;s a key property. Let me confirm. In the Petersen graph, if two vertices are non-adjacent, they have exactly one common neighbor. If they are adjacent, they have no common neighbors. Because it&#x27;s a strongly regular graph with parameters (10,3,0,1), which means each pair of adjacent vertices has 0 common neighbors, and each pair of non-adjacent vertices has 1 common neighbor.

Therefore, in the induced subgraph, if two vertices are adjacent in the Petersen graph, they have no common neighbors in the entire graph, so also in the induced subgraph. If two vertices are non-adjacent in the induced subgraph, they could be adjacent or non-adjacent in the whole graph. But if they are non-adjacent in the whole graph, they have one common neighbor in the whole graph, but that common neighbor might not be in the induced subgraph.

But let&#x27;s consider trying to form K_{3,3}. Suppose we have partitions A and B, each with three vertices. In K_{3,3}, every vertex in A is connected to every vertex in B, and there are no edges within A or within B. So in the induced subgraph, there should be no edges within A or within B, and all edges between A and B.

But in the Petersen graph, edges are arranged such that the outer pentagon and inner pentagram each have their own edges. Let&#x27;s think of the standard drawing. If we pick three vertices from the outer pentagon, they form a path or something. Each is connected to two others in the pentagon. So if we include three outer vertices, they have edges among themselves, which would violate the requirement of K_{3,3} having no edges within a partition. Similarly, three inner vertices would have edges among themselves. Therefore, if we pick three from the outer and three from the inner, the induced subgraph would have edges within the outer three, edges within the inner three, and some edges between them. But K_{3,3} has no edges within partitions. Therefore, such a subgraph would have extra edges, so it wouldn&#x27;t be a K_{3,3}.

Alternatively, maybe pick six vertices not split as three outer and three inner. But the Petersen graph is symmetric, so any six vertices would have a similar structure. Wait, but how else can you partition six vertices? Maybe two from outer, two from inner, and two others? But since the graph is symmetric, perhaps the induced subgraphs would still have edges within their groups.

Alternatively, consider another approach: the complement of the Petersen graph. But maybe that&#x27;s not helpful here.

Wait, another property: K_{3,3} has nine edges. The induced subgraph would need to have nine edges. Let&#x27;s calculate the number of edges in a 6-vertex induced subgraph of the Petersen graph. Each vertex has degree 3, but when you take an induced subgraph, each vertex can have degree between 0 and 3. The total number of edges in the induced subgraph can be calculated by summing the degrees and dividing by 2, but since we&#x27;re dealing with induced subgraphs, it&#x27;s just the number of edges present between those six vertices.

But how many edges can there be? Let&#x27;s see. In the entire Petersen graph, there are 15 edges. If we take six vertices, the maximum number of edges they can have is C(6,2) = 15, but obviously, the induced subgraph will have fewer since the Petersen graph isn&#x27;t complete. Given the regularity and structure, how many edges would a 6-vertex induced subgraph have?

Alternatively, since each vertex has degree 3, in the induced subgraph, each vertex can have at most 3 edges. But since the graph is 3-regular, each vertex has 3 edges in the whole graph. So in the induced subgraph, the degree of a vertex is the number of its neighbors that are also in the subgraph. So the number of edges in the induced subgraph would be half the sum of the degrees of the vertices within the subgraph. Since each vertex can contribute 0 to 3 edges, the total number of edges could be up to (6*3)/2 = 9, which is the number of edges in K_{3,3}. But is there an induced subgraph with 9 edges?

For that, each vertex in the subgraph would need to have degree 3 in the subgraph. But since the original graph is 3-regular, if a vertex has all three neighbors inside the subgraph, then it contributes 3 to the sum. If a vertex has, say, two neighbors inside the subgraph, it contributes 2, etc.

So to have 9 edges, the sum of degrees must be 18, but since each edge is counted twice, 9 edges correspond to sum of degrees 18. Therefore, each of the six vertices must have degree 3 in the induced subgraph, meaning each vertex is connected to all three others in the subgraph. But that would mean the induced subgraph is a 3-regular graph on six vertices. However, the only 3-regular graph on six vertices is the complete bipartite graph K_{3,3}, which is bipartite, and the complete tripartite graph... Wait, no. The 3-regular graphs on six vertices include K_{3,3} and the prism graph (two triangles connected by a matching), also known as the triangular prism, which is a 3-regular graph but not bipartite. So there are two 3-regular graphs on six vertices: K_{3,3} and the prism graph.

Therefore, if the induced subgraph is 3-regular, it could be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But in the Petersen graph, can we find an induced subgraph that&#x27;s 3-regular on six vertices? Let&#x27;s check.

If such a subgraph exists, it would need to be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But given the properties of the Petersen graph, like any two non-adjacent vertices having exactly one common neighbor, let&#x27;s see if a 3-regular induced subgraph is possible.

Suppose we have six vertices forming an induced subgraph. If it&#x27;s K_{3,3}, then it&#x27;s bipartite with partitions A and B. Each vertex in A is connected to all in B, and there are no edges within A or B. But in the Petersen graph, if we take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram, as before, they have edges within their own partitions. So that can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. If we take six vertices in some other configuration, perhaps?

Wait, the prism graph (two triangles connected by edges) is another 3-regular graph on six vertices. Let&#x27;s see if that exists as an induced subgraph in the Petersen graph. The prism graph has two triangles, each triangle being a 3-cycle. But the Petersen graph has girth 5, so it has no 3-cycles. Therefore, the prism graph cannot be a subgraph of the Petersen graph, induced or otherwise. Therefore, the only possible 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices would be K_{3,3}. But since the prism graph is excluded due to the girth, and K_{3,3} would require no edges within each partition, but any three vertices in the Petersen graph would have edges among themselves if they are from the outer or inner cycles.

Therefore, it&#x27;s impossible to have a 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices in the Petersen graph. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph. Thus, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph without induced K_5 or K_{3,3}, making it a counterexample to the original assertion.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample to refute the assertion that &quot;Every graph \( G \) without an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \) subgraph is planar,&quot; we need to check the following:

1. **Planarity of the Petersen Graph**: The Petersen graph is a well-known non-planar graph.
2. **Induced Subgraphs**: We need to verify if the Petersen graph contains an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \).

**Key Points**:
- The Petersen graph is non-planar.
- The Petersen graph is cubic (each vertex has degree 3), so it cannot contain \( K_5 \) as a subgraph (since \( K_5 \) requires each vertex to have degree 4).
- The Petersen graph does not contain \( K_{3,3} \) as an induced subgraph. This is because any induced subgraph of six vertices in the Petersen graph cannot be bipartite with all edges present between the two partitions (as required for \( K_{3,3} \)). The structure of the Petersen graph, with its girth of 5 and the property that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor, prevents the existence of such an induced subgraph.

**Conclusion**:
The Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \). Therefore, it serves as a counterexample to the given assertion.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the Petersen graph can be a counterexample to the statement that &quot;Every graph G without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 subgraph is planar.&quot; Hmm. Let&#x27;s break this down step by step.

First, let me recall some basics. A planar graph is one that can be drawn on the plane without any edges crossing. Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem tells us that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K_5 (the complete graph on five vertices) or K_{3,3} (the complete bipartite graph on six vertices, split into two sets of three). However, the question here is about induced subgraphs, not subdivisions. So the original assertion is saying that if a graph doesn&#x27;t have K_{3,3} or K_5 as an induced subgraph, then it must be planar. If the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have these as induced subgraphs but is itself non-planar, then it would be a counterexample.

Alright, so let me recall the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s a well-known non-planar graph. I remember that it doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but wait, does it contain them as induced subgraphs? That&#x27;s the key here. The original assertion is about induced subgraphs, so even if the Petersen graph had a K_{3,3} or K_5 as a subgraph but not induced, it wouldn&#x27;t matter. The question is specifically about induced ones.

Let me confirm. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges. It&#x27;s a cubic graph (each vertex has degree 3). K_5 has 10 edges and is a complete graph, so each vertex has degree 4. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, it can&#x27;t contain K_5 as a subgraph because you can&#x27;t have a vertex with degree 4 in a cubic graph. Similarly, K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph with each vertex of degree 3. So maybe K_{3,3} could be a subgraph? But again, the question is about induced subgraphs.

An induced subgraph is a subset of the vertices of a graph together with all the edges whose endpoints are both in this subset. So even if the Petersen graph has a subgraph isomorphic to K_{3,3}, unless all the edges present in K_{3,3} between those vertices are also present in the Petersen graph, it&#x27;s not an induced subgraph.

Let me check if the Petersen graph contains an induced K_{3,3}. The Petersen graph is known to be non-planar, but according to Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem, it must contain a subdivision of K_5 or K_{3,3}. Indeed, the Petersen graph is a famous example of a non-planar graph that doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but it does contain a subdivision of K_{3,3}. However, a subdivision is different from an induced subgraph. Subdividing edges adds new vertices on the edges, so a subdivided K_{3,3} would not be an induced subgraph because the original edges are split into paths.

Therefore, the Petersen graph itself is non-planar, but does it contain an induced K_5 or K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s check K_5 first. As mentioned, all vertices in the Petersen graph have degree 3, but in K_5, every vertex has degree 4. So even if you take any 5 vertices in the Petersen graph, they can&#x27;t form a K_5 because the degrees are insufficient. So, there&#x27;s no induced K_5.

What about K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s see. K_{3,3} is bipartite, with two partitions each containing three vertices, and every vertex in one partition connected to every vertex in the other. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex has degree 3. If there was an induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph, each vertex in one partition would need to be connected to all three vertices in the other partition. But since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex can only have three edges. However, in K_{3,3}, each vertex is connected to three vertices in the opposite partition. So, if a vertex in the induced subgraph is part of the K_{3,3}, all its neighbors in the Petersen graph must be within the K_{3,3} as well. But in the Petersen graph, the neighborhoods are structured such that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let me try to visualize the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s usually drawn as a pentagon connected to a pentagram, with each vertex of the pentagon connected to a corresponding vertex of the pentagram. Each vertex is connected to three others: two in its own pentagon/pentagram and one in the other.

Suppose we try to find an induced K_{3,3}. Let&#x27;s take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices and one outer vertex. If we pick three outer vertices and three inner ones, perhaps we can form a bipartition. However, in the Petersen graph, each outer vertex is connected to only one inner vertex, and each inner vertex is connected to only one outer vertex. So, for example, if we take three outer vertices and their corresponding three inner vertices (each connected by a spoke), the edges between the outer and inner vertices would only be the three spokes. But in K_{3,3}, every outer vertex must connect to every inner vertex. In this case, each outer vertex is only connected to one inner vertex, so that&#x27;s only three edges between the partitions, whereas K_{3,3} would require nine edges (3x3). So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Alternatively, maybe if we select different sets of three vertices. Let me think. Since the Petersen graph is symmetric, any selection of six vertices should be similar. Suppose we try to find a bipartite induced subgraph with partitions of size three and three. The problem is that in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let&#x27;s say we pick three vertices from one partition. Each needs to be connected to all three in the other partition. But given the structure of the Petersen graph, each vertex is only connected to three others. If a vertex is in one partition, to connect to all three in the other partition, that would require three edges. But if the other partition has three vertices, each of those would need to connect back to all three in the first partition. However, each vertex in the other partition is already connected to two others in their own partition (if they are on the pentagon or pentagram) and one in the opposite. So they can&#x27;t have three edges to the first partition. Hence, it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph.

Therefore, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as an induced subgraph. Thus, it would serve as a counterexample to the assertion that every graph without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 is planar.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in reasoning about K_{3,3}. Let me try to see if there is a subset of six vertices in the Petersen graph that induce a K_{3,3}. Take the Petersen graph and label the outer pentagon vertices as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 and the inner pentagram vertices as u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, where each ui is connected to vi. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices (in the pentagram) and one outer vertex. So, suppose we take three outer vertices, say v1, v2, v3, and three inner vertices, say u4, u5, u1. Wait, u1 is connected to v1. Let&#x27;s see. The connections between the outer and inner vertices are only the spokes, so v1 is connected to u1, v2 to u2, etc. If we take v1, v2, v3 from the outer and u4, u5, u1 from the inner, then v1 is connected to u1, v2 is connected to u2 (which is not in the set), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set). So, in this subset, the only edges between the outer and inner are v1-u1. The rest of the edges would be the outer edges (v1-v2, v2-v3, v3-v4, etc.), but since we took only v1, v2, v3, the outer edges are v1-v2, v2-v3. The inner vertices u4, u5, u1: in the inner pentagram, u4 is connected to u5 and u3, but u3 isn&#x27;t in the set. u5 is connected to u4 and u1. u1 is connected to u5 and u2 (which isn&#x27;t in the set). So within the inner subset, u4 is connected to u5, u5 is connected to u1, and u1 is connected to no one else in the inner subset. So the induced subgraph on these six vertices would have edges: between outer vertices: v1-v2, v2-v3; between inner vertices: u4-u5, u5-u1; and the spoke edge v1-u1. That&#x27;s nothing like K_{3,3}; it&#x27;s missing almost all the edges.

Alternatively, pick six vertices in some other way. Maybe three from the outer and three from the inner, but not corresponding. For example, take v1, v3, v5 from the outer and u2, u4, u5 from the inner. Let&#x27;s check edges. The outer edges: v1 connected to v2 and v5 (but v2 and v5 are not in the set), so v1 only connected to v5. Wait, no, in the outer pentagon, v1 is connected to v2 and v5. But if we take v1, v3, v5, then v1 is connected to v5 (since they&#x27;re adjacent on the pentagon), v3 is connected to v4 and v2 (neither in the set), and v5 is connected to v1 and v4 (not in the set). So the outer subset has edges v1-v5. The inner subset u2, u4, u5: u2 is connected to u1 and u3 (not in the set), u4 is connected to u3 and u5, u5 is connected to u4 and u1 (not in the set). So u4-u5 is an edge. Between the outer and inner: v1 connected to u1 (not in the inner subset), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set), v5 connected to u5. So only v5-u5 is an edge. So the induced subgraph has edges v1-v5, u4-u5, and v5-u5. That&#x27;s just a triangle? Wait, no. v1 is connected to v5, v5 is connected to u5, and u5 is connected to u4. So it&#x27;s a path of three edges. Not K_{3,3}.

Hmm. Maybe trying different combinations. Alternatively, maybe pick vertices not all from outer and inner. Wait, but the Petersen graph is symmetric, so it shouldn&#x27;t matter. But perhaps if I pick vertices that form a 6-cycle or something. Wait, the Petersen graph has girth 5, so there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So any induced subgraph with a 6-cycle would have to be a hexagon, but the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have a 6-cycle. Wait, actually, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5 and 6? Wait, no, the girth is 5, meaning the shortest cycle is 5. So any cycle of length 6 would have to be a longer cycle. Wait, but can you even get a 6-cycle in the Petersen graph?

Wait, let me check. In the standard Petersen graph, if you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. The inner pentagram is also a 5-cycle. If you traverse the spokes, you can get longer cycles. For example, starting at v1, go to u1, then to u2, then to v2, then to v3, then to u3, then to u4, then to v4, etc. But I think the cycles are either of length 5 or longer. But does it have a 6-cycle? Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1, go to v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, back to v1. Wait, is that a cycle? v1 to v2 (outer edge), v2 to v3 (outer edge), v3 to u3 (spoke), u3 to u4 (inner edge), u4 to v4 (spoke), v4 to v1 (outer edge). That&#x27;s a 6-cycle: v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1. But wait, does this form a cycle? Let&#x27;s check the connections:

v1 adjacent to v2: yes.

v2 adjacent to v3: yes.

v3 adjacent to u3: yes.

u3 adjacent to u4: in the inner pentagon, u3 is adjacent to u4 and u2, yes.

u4 adjacent to v4: yes.

v4 adjacent to v1: yes, if in the outer pentagon, v4 is adjacent to v5 and v3. Wait, no. Wait, the outer pentagon is v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, with each adjacent to the next. So v4 is adjacent to v3 and v5. So v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, the path v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1 is not a cycle because v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, that&#x27;s a 6-vertex path, but not a cycle.

Hmm. So maybe there&#x27;s no 6-cycle in the Petersen graph. Wait, but according to some references, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5, 6, 8, and 9, but I need to confirm. Let me think. If you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. If you take the inner pentagram, that&#x27;s another 5-cycle. For a 6-cycle, maybe traverse spokes and inner edges. For example: v1, u1, u2, v2, v3, u3, v1. Wait, but that would be v1 connected to u1, u1 connected to u2, u2 connected to v2, v2 connected to v3, v3 connected to u3, u3 connected to v1? Wait, u3 is not connected to v1. So that doesn&#x27;t form a cycle. Alternatively, v1, u1, u5, v5, v4, u4, v1. Let&#x27;s check: v1-u1, u1-u5 (inner edge), u5-v5, v5-v4, v4-u4, u4 connected to v1? No, u4 is connected to v4 and u3. So no. So maybe that&#x27;s not a cycle.

Alternatively, maybe another path. Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1: v1, v2, u2, u3, v3, v4, v1. But v4 is not connected to v1. Hmm. Maybe it&#x27;s not possible. Wait, actually, according to the properties of the Petersen graph, it is a 3-regular graph with girth 5, so the shortest cycle is 5, and it doesn&#x27;t have cycles of length 3 or 4. So perhaps there are cycles of length 6, but they are not induced cycles. Because an induced cycle would require that there are no chords, but in a 6-cycle, if there are chords, it&#x27;s not induced. Given that the Petersen graph is 3-regular, adding chords might complicate things. But since the girth is 5, there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So, a 6-cycle would have to be chordless, which would make it an induced cycle. But does such a cycle exist?

Wait, in the Petersen graph, can we find a 6-cycle? Let me check online in my mind. I recall that the Petersen graph does have cycles of length 6, but they are not induced. Wait, if the girth is 5, then any 6-cycle must have a chord, making it non-induced. Therefore, there are no induced 6-cycles. Therefore, any 6-vertex induced subgraph cannot be a cycle. So, perhaps the induced subgraphs on six vertices in the Petersen graph are not bipartite. But K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph. So, if the induced subgraph is not bipartite, it can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. Alternatively, even if it&#x27;s bipartite, it needs to be complete.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s take a different approach. Let&#x27;s check all possible 6-vertex induced subgraphs of the Petersen graph. Since the Petersen graph is small, maybe this is feasible. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices, so the number of 6-vertex induced subgraphs is C(10,6) = 210. That&#x27;s a lot, but maybe we can reason about their properties.

In an induced subgraph of six vertices, each vertex can have degree at most 3 (since the original graph is 3-regular). For it to be K_{3,3}, each vertex in one partition must have degree 3, connected to all three vertices in the other partition. So in total, each partition has three vertices, and all 9 edges are present between them. But in the induced subgraph, we need to have exactly those edges and no others.

But in the Petersen graph, any two adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Wait, no. Wait, in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. That&#x27;s a key property. Let me confirm. In the Petersen graph, if two vertices are non-adjacent, they have exactly one common neighbor. If they are adjacent, they have no common neighbors. Because it&#x27;s a strongly regular graph with parameters (10,3,0,1), which means each pair of adjacent vertices has 0 common neighbors, and each pair of non-adjacent vertices has 1 common neighbor.

Therefore, in the induced subgraph, if two vertices are adjacent in the Petersen graph, they have no common neighbors in the entire graph, so also in the induced subgraph. If two vertices are non-adjacent in the induced subgraph, they could be adjacent or non-adjacent in the whole graph. But if they are non-adjacent in the whole graph, they have one common neighbor in the whole graph, but that common neighbor might not be in the induced subgraph.

But let&#x27;s consider trying to form K_{3,3}. Suppose we have partitions A and B, each with three vertices. In K_{3,3}, every vertex in A is connected to every vertex in B, and there are no edges within A or within B. So in the induced subgraph, there should be no edges within A or within B, and all edges between A and B.

But in the Petersen graph, edges are arranged such that the outer pentagon and inner pentagram each have their own edges. Let&#x27;s think of the standard drawing. If we pick three vertices from the outer pentagon, they form a path or something. Each is connected to two others in the pentagon. So if we include three outer vertices, they have edges among themselves, which would violate the requirement of K_{3,3} having no edges within a partition. Similarly, three inner vertices would have edges among themselves. Therefore, if we pick three from the outer and three from the inner, the induced subgraph would have edges within the outer three, edges within the inner three, and some edges between them. But K_{3,3} has no edges within partitions. Therefore, such a subgraph would have extra edges, so it wouldn&#x27;t be a K_{3,3}.

Alternatively, maybe pick six vertices not split as three outer and three inner. But the Petersen graph is symmetric, so any six vertices would have a similar structure. Wait, but how else can you partition six vertices? Maybe two from outer, two from inner, and two others? But since the graph is symmetric, perhaps the induced subgraphs would still have edges within their groups.

Alternatively, consider another approach: the complement of the Petersen graph. But maybe that&#x27;s not helpful here.

Wait, another property: K_{3,3} has nine edges. The induced subgraph would need to have nine edges. Let&#x27;s calculate the number of edges in a 6-vertex induced subgraph of the Petersen graph. Each vertex has degree 3, but when you take an induced subgraph, each vertex can have degree between 0 and 3. The total number of edges in the induced subgraph can be calculated by summing the degrees and dividing by 2, but since we&#x27;re dealing with induced subgraphs, it&#x27;s just the number of edges present between those six vertices.

But how many edges can there be? Let&#x27;s see. In the entire Petersen graph, there are 15 edges. If we take six vertices, the maximum number of edges they can have is C(6,2) = 15, but obviously, the induced subgraph will have fewer since the Petersen graph isn&#x27;t complete. Given the regularity and structure, how many edges would a 6-vertex induced subgraph have?

Alternatively, since each vertex has degree 3, in the induced subgraph, each vertex can have at most 3 edges. But since the graph is 3-regular, each vertex has 3 edges in the whole graph. So in the induced subgraph, the degree of a vertex is the number of its neighbors that are also in the subgraph. So the number of edges in the induced subgraph would be half the sum of the degrees of the vertices within the subgraph. Since each vertex can contribute 0 to 3 edges, the total number of edges could be up to (6*3)/2 = 9, which is the number of edges in K_{3,3}. But is there an induced subgraph with 9 edges?

For that, each vertex in the subgraph would need to have degree 3 in the subgraph. But since the original graph is 3-regular, if a vertex has all three neighbors inside the subgraph, then it contributes 3 to the sum. If a vertex has, say, two neighbors inside the subgraph, it contributes 2, etc.

So to have 9 edges, the sum of degrees must be 18, but since each edge is counted twice, 9 edges correspond to sum of degrees 18. Therefore, each of the six vertices must have degree 3 in the induced subgraph, meaning each vertex is connected to all three others in the subgraph. But that would mean the induced subgraph is a 3-regular graph on six vertices. However, the only 3-regular graph on six vertices is the complete bipartite graph K_{3,3}, which is bipartite, and the complete tripartite graph... Wait, no. The 3-regular graphs on six vertices include K_{3,3} and the prism graph (two triangles connected by a matching), also known as the triangular prism, which is a 3-regular graph but not bipartite. So there are two 3-regular graphs on six vertices: K_{3,3} and the prism graph.

Therefore, if the induced subgraph is 3-regular, it could be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But in the Petersen graph, can we find an induced subgraph that&#x27;s 3-regular on six vertices? Let&#x27;s check.

If such a subgraph exists, it would need to be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But given the properties of the Petersen graph, like any two non-adjacent vertices having exactly one common neighbor, let&#x27;s see if a 3-regular induced subgraph is possible.

Suppose we have six vertices forming an induced subgraph. If it&#x27;s K_{3,3}, then it&#x27;s bipartite with partitions A and B. Each vertex in A is connected to all in B, and there are no edges within A or B. But in the Petersen graph, if we take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram, as before, they have edges within their own partitions. So that can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. If we take six vertices in some other configuration, perhaps?

Wait, the prism graph (two triangles connected by edges) is another 3-regular graph on six vertices. Let&#x27;s see if that exists as an induced subgraph in the Petersen graph. The prism graph has two triangles, each triangle being a 3-cycle. But the Petersen graph has girth 5, so it has no 3-cycles. Therefore, the prism graph cannot be a subgraph of the Petersen graph, induced or otherwise. Therefore, the only possible 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices would be K_{3,3}. But since the prism graph is excluded due to the girth, and K_{3,3} would require no edges within each partition, but any three vertices in the Petersen graph would have edges among themselves if they are from the outer or inner cycles.

Therefore, it&#x27;s impossible to have a 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices in the Petersen graph. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph. Thus, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph without induced K_5 or K_{3,3}, making it a counterexample to the original assertion.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample to refute the assertion that &quot;Every graph \( G \) without an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \) subgraph is planar,&quot; we need to check the following:

1. **Planarity of the Petersen Graph**: The Petersen graph is a well-known non-planar graph.
2. **Induced Subgraphs**: We need to verify if the Petersen graph contains an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \).

**Key Points**:
- The Petersen graph is non-planar.
- The Petersen graph is cubic (each vertex has degree 3), so it cannot contain \( K_5 \) as a subgraph (since \( K_5 \) requires each vertex to have degree 4).
- The Petersen graph does not contain \( K_{3,3} \) as an induced subgraph. This is because any induced subgraph of six vertices in the Petersen graph cannot be bipartite with all edges present between the two partitions (as required for \( K_{3,3} \)). The structure of the Petersen graph, with its girth of 5 and the property that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor, prevents the existence of such an induced subgraph.

**Conclusion**:
The Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \). Therefore, it serves as a counterexample to the given assertion.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the Petersen graph can be a counterexample to the statement that &quot;Every graph G without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 subgraph is planar.&quot; Hmm. Let&#x27;s break this down step by step.

First, let me recall some basics. A planar graph is one that can be drawn on the plane without any edges crossing. Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem tells us that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K_5 (the complete graph on five vertices) or K_{3,3} (the complete bipartite graph on six vertices, split into two sets of three). However, the question here is about induced subgraphs, not subdivisions. So the original assertion is saying that if a graph doesn&#x27;t have K_{3,3} or K_5 as an induced subgraph, then it must be planar. If the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have these as induced subgraphs but is itself non-planar, then it would be a counterexample.

Alright, so let me recall the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s a well-known non-planar graph. I remember that it doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but wait, does it contain them as induced subgraphs? That&#x27;s the key here. The original assertion is about induced subgraphs, so even if the Petersen graph had a K_{3,3} or K_5 as a subgraph but not induced, it wouldn&#x27;t matter. The question is specifically about induced ones.

Let me confirm. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges. It&#x27;s a cubic graph (each vertex has degree 3). K_5 has 10 edges and is a complete graph, so each vertex has degree 4. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, it can&#x27;t contain K_5 as a subgraph because you can&#x27;t have a vertex with degree 4 in a cubic graph. Similarly, K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph with each vertex of degree 3. So maybe K_{3,3} could be a subgraph? But again, the question is about induced subgraphs.

An induced subgraph is a subset of the vertices of a graph together with all the edges whose endpoints are both in this subset. So even if the Petersen graph has a subgraph isomorphic to K_{3,3}, unless all the edges present in K_{3,3} between those vertices are also present in the Petersen graph, it&#x27;s not an induced subgraph.

Let me check if the Petersen graph contains an induced K_{3,3}. The Petersen graph is known to be non-planar, but according to Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem, it must contain a subdivision of K_5 or K_{3,3}. Indeed, the Petersen graph is a famous example of a non-planar graph that doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but it does contain a subdivision of K_{3,3}. However, a subdivision is different from an induced subgraph. Subdividing edges adds new vertices on the edges, so a subdivided K_{3,3} would not be an induced subgraph because the original edges are split into paths.

Therefore, the Petersen graph itself is non-planar, but does it contain an induced K_5 or K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s check K_5 first. As mentioned, all vertices in the Petersen graph have degree 3, but in K_5, every vertex has degree 4. So even if you take any 5 vertices in the Petersen graph, they can&#x27;t form a K_5 because the degrees are insufficient. So, there&#x27;s no induced K_5.

What about K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s see. K_{3,3} is bipartite, with two partitions each containing three vertices, and every vertex in one partition connected to every vertex in the other. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex has degree 3. If there was an induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph, each vertex in one partition would need to be connected to all three vertices in the other partition. But since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex can only have three edges. However, in K_{3,3}, each vertex is connected to three vertices in the opposite partition. So, if a vertex in the induced subgraph is part of the K_{3,3}, all its neighbors in the Petersen graph must be within the K_{3,3} as well. But in the Petersen graph, the neighborhoods are structured such that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let me try to visualize the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s usually drawn as a pentagon connected to a pentagram, with each vertex of the pentagon connected to a corresponding vertex of the pentagram. Each vertex is connected to three others: two in its own pentagon/pentagram and one in the other.

Suppose we try to find an induced K_{3,3}. Let&#x27;s take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices and one outer vertex. If we pick three outer vertices and three inner ones, perhaps we can form a bipartition. However, in the Petersen graph, each outer vertex is connected to only one inner vertex, and each inner vertex is connected to only one outer vertex. So, for example, if we take three outer vertices and their corresponding three inner vertices (each connected by a spoke), the edges between the outer and inner vertices would only be the three spokes. But in K_{3,3}, every outer vertex must connect to every inner vertex. In this case, each outer vertex is only connected to one inner vertex, so that&#x27;s only three edges between the partitions, whereas K_{3,3} would require nine edges (3x3). So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Alternatively, maybe if we select different sets of three vertices. Let me think. Since the Petersen graph is symmetric, any selection of six vertices should be similar. Suppose we try to find a bipartite induced subgraph with partitions of size three and three. The problem is that in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let&#x27;s say we pick three vertices from one partition. Each needs to be connected to all three in the other partition. But given the structure of the Petersen graph, each vertex is only connected to three others. If a vertex is in one partition, to connect to all three in the other partition, that would require three edges. But if the other partition has three vertices, each of those would need to connect back to all three in the first partition. However, each vertex in the other partition is already connected to two others in their own partition (if they are on the pentagon or pentagram) and one in the opposite. So they can&#x27;t have three edges to the first partition. Hence, it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph.

Therefore, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as an induced subgraph. Thus, it would serve as a counterexample to the assertion that every graph without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 is planar.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in reasoning about K_{3,3}. Let me try to see if there is a subset of six vertices in the Petersen graph that induce a K_{3,3}. Take the Petersen graph and label the outer pentagon vertices as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 and the inner pentagram vertices as u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, where each ui is connected to vi. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices (in the pentagram) and one outer vertex. So, suppose we take three outer vertices, say v1, v2, v3, and three inner vertices, say u4, u5, u1. Wait, u1 is connected to v1. Let&#x27;s see. The connections between the outer and inner vertices are only the spokes, so v1 is connected to u1, v2 to u2, etc. If we take v1, v2, v3 from the outer and u4, u5, u1 from the inner, then v1 is connected to u1, v2 is connected to u2 (which is not in the set), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set). So, in this subset, the only edges between the outer and inner are v1-u1. The rest of the edges would be the outer edges (v1-v2, v2-v3, v3-v4, etc.), but since we took only v1, v2, v3, the outer edges are v1-v2, v2-v3. The inner vertices u4, u5, u1: in the inner pentagram, u4 is connected to u5 and u3, but u3 isn&#x27;t in the set. u5 is connected to u4 and u1. u1 is connected to u5 and u2 (which isn&#x27;t in the set). So within the inner subset, u4 is connected to u5, u5 is connected to u1, and u1 is connected to no one else in the inner subset. So the induced subgraph on these six vertices would have edges: between outer vertices: v1-v2, v2-v3; between inner vertices: u4-u5, u5-u1; and the spoke edge v1-u1. That&#x27;s nothing like K_{3,3}; it&#x27;s missing almost all the edges.

Alternatively, pick six vertices in some other way. Maybe three from the outer and three from the inner, but not corresponding. For example, take v1, v3, v5 from the outer and u2, u4, u5 from the inner. Let&#x27;s check edges. The outer edges: v1 connected to v2 and v5 (but v2 and v5 are not in the set), so v1 only connected to v5. Wait, no, in the outer pentagon, v1 is connected to v2 and v5. But if we take v1, v3, v5, then v1 is connected to v5 (since they&#x27;re adjacent on the pentagon), v3 is connected to v4 and v2 (neither in the set), and v5 is connected to v1 and v4 (not in the set). So the outer subset has edges v1-v5. The inner subset u2, u4, u5: u2 is connected to u1 and u3 (not in the set), u4 is connected to u3 and u5, u5 is connected to u4 and u1 (not in the set). So u4-u5 is an edge. Between the outer and inner: v1 connected to u1 (not in the inner subset), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set), v5 connected to u5. So only v5-u5 is an edge. So the induced subgraph has edges v1-v5, u4-u5, and v5-u5. That&#x27;s just a triangle? Wait, no. v1 is connected to v5, v5 is connected to u5, and u5 is connected to u4. So it&#x27;s a path of three edges. Not K_{3,3}.

Hmm. Maybe trying different combinations. Alternatively, maybe pick vertices not all from outer and inner. Wait, but the Petersen graph is symmetric, so it shouldn&#x27;t matter. But perhaps if I pick vertices that form a 6-cycle or something. Wait, the Petersen graph has girth 5, so there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So any induced subgraph with a 6-cycle would have to be a hexagon, but the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have a 6-cycle. Wait, actually, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5 and 6? Wait, no, the girth is 5, meaning the shortest cycle is 5. So any cycle of length 6 would have to be a longer cycle. Wait, but can you even get a 6-cycle in the Petersen graph?

Wait, let me check. In the standard Petersen graph, if you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. The inner pentagram is also a 5-cycle. If you traverse the spokes, you can get longer cycles. For example, starting at v1, go to u1, then to u2, then to v2, then to v3, then to u3, then to u4, then to v4, etc. But I think the cycles are either of length 5 or longer. But does it have a 6-cycle? Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1, go to v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, back to v1. Wait, is that a cycle? v1 to v2 (outer edge), v2 to v3 (outer edge), v3 to u3 (spoke), u3 to u4 (inner edge), u4 to v4 (spoke), v4 to v1 (outer edge). That&#x27;s a 6-cycle: v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1. But wait, does this form a cycle? Let&#x27;s check the connections:

v1 adjacent to v2: yes.

v2 adjacent to v3: yes.

v3 adjacent to u3: yes.

u3 adjacent to u4: in the inner pentagon, u3 is adjacent to u4 and u2, yes.

u4 adjacent to v4: yes.

v4 adjacent to v1: yes, if in the outer pentagon, v4 is adjacent to v5 and v3. Wait, no. Wait, the outer pentagon is v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, with each adjacent to the next. So v4 is adjacent to v3 and v5. So v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, the path v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1 is not a cycle because v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, that&#x27;s a 6-vertex path, but not a cycle.

Hmm. So maybe there&#x27;s no 6-cycle in the Petersen graph. Wait, but according to some references, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5, 6, 8, and 9, but I need to confirm. Let me think. If you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. If you take the inner pentagram, that&#x27;s another 5-cycle. For a 6-cycle, maybe traverse spokes and inner edges. For example: v1, u1, u2, v2, v3, u3, v1. Wait, but that would be v1 connected to u1, u1 connected to u2, u2 connected to v2, v2 connected to v3, v3 connected to u3, u3 connected to v1? Wait, u3 is not connected to v1. So that doesn&#x27;t form a cycle. Alternatively, v1, u1, u5, v5, v4, u4, v1. Let&#x27;s check: v1-u1, u1-u5 (inner edge), u5-v5, v5-v4, v4-u4, u4 connected to v1? No, u4 is connected to v4 and u3. So no. So maybe that&#x27;s not a cycle.

Alternatively, maybe another path. Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1: v1, v2, u2, u3, v3, v4, v1. But v4 is not connected to v1. Hmm. Maybe it&#x27;s not possible. Wait, actually, according to the properties of the Petersen graph, it is a 3-regular graph with girth 5, so the shortest cycle is 5, and it doesn&#x27;t have cycles of length 3 or 4. So perhaps there are cycles of length 6, but they are not induced cycles. Because an induced cycle would require that there are no chords, but in a 6-cycle, if there are chords, it&#x27;s not induced. Given that the Petersen graph is 3-regular, adding chords might complicate things. But since the girth is 5, there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So, a 6-cycle would have to be chordless, which would make it an induced cycle. But does such a cycle exist?

Wait, in the Petersen graph, can we find a 6-cycle? Let me check online in my mind. I recall that the Petersen graph does have cycles of length 6, but they are not induced. Wait, if the girth is 5, then any 6-cycle must have a chord, making it non-induced. Therefore, there are no induced 6-cycles. Therefore, any 6-vertex induced subgraph cannot be a cycle. So, perhaps the induced subgraphs on six vertices in the Petersen graph are not bipartite. But K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph. So, if the induced subgraph is not bipartite, it can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. Alternatively, even if it&#x27;s bipartite, it needs to be complete.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s take a different approach. Let&#x27;s check all possible 6-vertex induced subgraphs of the Petersen graph. Since the Petersen graph is small, maybe this is feasible. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices, so the number of 6-vertex induced subgraphs is C(10,6) = 210. That&#x27;s a lot, but maybe we can reason about their properties.

In an induced subgraph of six vertices, each vertex can have degree at most 3 (since the original graph is 3-regular). For it to be K_{3,3}, each vertex in one partition must have degree 3, connected to all three vertices in the other partition. So in total, each partition has three vertices, and all 9 edges are present between them. But in the induced subgraph, we need to have exactly those edges and no others.

But in the Petersen graph, any two adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Wait, no. Wait, in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. That&#x27;s a key property. Let me confirm. In the Petersen graph, if two vertices are non-adjacent, they have exactly one common neighbor. If they are adjacent, they have no common neighbors. Because it&#x27;s a strongly regular graph with parameters (10,3,0,1), which means each pair of adjacent vertices has 0 common neighbors, and each pair of non-adjacent vertices has 1 common neighbor.

Therefore, in the induced subgraph, if two vertices are adjacent in the Petersen graph, they have no common neighbors in the entire graph, so also in the induced subgraph. If two vertices are non-adjacent in the induced subgraph, they could be adjacent or non-adjacent in the whole graph. But if they are non-adjacent in the whole graph, they have one common neighbor in the whole graph, but that common neighbor might not be in the induced subgraph.

But let&#x27;s consider trying to form K_{3,3}. Suppose we have partitions A and B, each with three vertices. In K_{3,3}, every vertex in A is connected to every vertex in B, and there are no edges within A or within B. So in the induced subgraph, there should be no edges within A or within B, and all edges between A and B.

But in the Petersen graph, edges are arranged such that the outer pentagon and inner pentagram each have their own edges. Let&#x27;s think of the standard drawing. If we pick three vertices from the outer pentagon, they form a path or something. Each is connected to two others in the pentagon. So if we include three outer vertices, they have edges among themselves, which would violate the requirement of K_{3,3} having no edges within a partition. Similarly, three inner vertices would have edges among themselves. Therefore, if we pick three from the outer and three from the inner, the induced subgraph would have edges within the outer three, edges within the inner three, and some edges between them. But K_{3,3} has no edges within partitions. Therefore, such a subgraph would have extra edges, so it wouldn&#x27;t be a K_{3,3}.

Alternatively, maybe pick six vertices not split as three outer and three inner. But the Petersen graph is symmetric, so any six vertices would have a similar structure. Wait, but how else can you partition six vertices? Maybe two from outer, two from inner, and two others? But since the graph is symmetric, perhaps the induced subgraphs would still have edges within their groups.

Alternatively, consider another approach: the complement of the Petersen graph. But maybe that&#x27;s not helpful here.

Wait, another property: K_{3,3} has nine edges. The induced subgraph would need to have nine edges. Let&#x27;s calculate the number of edges in a 6-vertex induced subgraph of the Petersen graph. Each vertex has degree 3, but when you take an induced subgraph, each vertex can have degree between 0 and 3. The total number of edges in the induced subgraph can be calculated by summing the degrees and dividing by 2, but since we&#x27;re dealing with induced subgraphs, it&#x27;s just the number of edges present between those six vertices.

But how many edges can there be? Let&#x27;s see. In the entire Petersen graph, there are 15 edges. If we take six vertices, the maximum number of edges they can have is C(6,2) = 15, but obviously, the induced subgraph will have fewer since the Petersen graph isn&#x27;t complete. Given the regularity and structure, how many edges would a 6-vertex induced subgraph have?

Alternatively, since each vertex has degree 3, in the induced subgraph, each vertex can have at most 3 edges. But since the graph is 3-regular, each vertex has 3 edges in the whole graph. So in the induced subgraph, the degree of a vertex is the number of its neighbors that are also in the subgraph. So the number of edges in the induced subgraph would be half the sum of the degrees of the vertices within the subgraph. Since each vertex can contribute 0 to 3 edges, the total number of edges could be up to (6*3)/2 = 9, which is the number of edges in K_{3,3}. But is there an induced subgraph with 9 edges?

For that, each vertex in the subgraph would need to have degree 3 in the subgraph. But since the original graph is 3-regular, if a vertex has all three neighbors inside the subgraph, then it contributes 3 to the sum. If a vertex has, say, two neighbors inside the subgraph, it contributes 2, etc.

So to have 9 edges, the sum of degrees must be 18, but since each edge is counted twice, 9 edges correspond to sum of degrees 18. Therefore, each of the six vertices must have degree 3 in the induced subgraph, meaning each vertex is connected to all three others in the subgraph. But that would mean the induced subgraph is a 3-regular graph on six vertices. However, the only 3-regular graph on six vertices is the complete bipartite graph K_{3,3}, which is bipartite, and the complete tripartite graph... Wait, no. The 3-regular graphs on six vertices include K_{3,3} and the prism graph (two triangles connected by a matching), also known as the triangular prism, which is a 3-regular graph but not bipartite. So there are two 3-regular graphs on six vertices: K_{3,3} and the prism graph.

Therefore, if the induced subgraph is 3-regular, it could be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But in the Petersen graph, can we find an induced subgraph that&#x27;s 3-regular on six vertices? Let&#x27;s check.

If such a subgraph exists, it would need to be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But given the properties of the Petersen graph, like any two non-adjacent vertices having exactly one common neighbor, let&#x27;s see if a 3-regular induced subgraph is possible.

Suppose we have six vertices forming an induced subgraph. If it&#x27;s K_{3,3}, then it&#x27;s bipartite with partitions A and B. Each vertex in A is connected to all in B, and there are no edges within A or B. But in the Petersen graph, if we take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram, as before, they have edges within their own partitions. So that can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. If we take six vertices in some other configuration, perhaps?

Wait, the prism graph (two triangles connected by edges) is another 3-regular graph on six vertices. Let&#x27;s see if that exists as an induced subgraph in the Petersen graph. The prism graph has two triangles, each triangle being a 3-cycle. But the Petersen graph has girth 5, so it has no 3-cycles. Therefore, the prism graph cannot be a subgraph of the Petersen graph, induced or otherwise. Therefore, the only possible 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices would be K_{3,3}. But since the prism graph is excluded due to the girth, and K_{3,3} would require no edges within each partition, but any three vertices in the Petersen graph would have edges among themselves if they are from the outer or inner cycles.

Therefore, it&#x27;s impossible to have a 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices in the Petersen graph. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph. Thus, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph without induced K_5 or K_{3,3}, making it a counterexample to the original assertion.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample to refute the assertion that &quot;Every graph \( G \) without an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \) subgraph is planar,&quot; we need to check the following:

1. **Planarity of the Petersen Graph**: The Petersen graph is a well-known non-planar graph.
2. **Induced Subgraphs**: We need to verify if the Petersen graph contains an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \).

**Key Points**:
- The Petersen graph is non-planar.
- The Petersen graph is cubic (each vertex has degree 3), so it cannot contain \( K_5 \) as a subgraph (since \( K_5 \) requires each vertex to have degree 4).
- The Petersen graph does not contain \( K_{3,3} \) as an induced subgraph. This is because any induced subgraph of six vertices in the Petersen graph cannot be bipartite with all edges present between the two partitions (as required for \( K_{3,3} \)). The structure of the Petersen graph, with its girth of 5 and the property that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor, prevents the existence of such an induced subgraph.

**Conclusion**:
The Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \). Therefore, it serves as a counterexample to the given assertion.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the Petersen graph can be a counterexample to the statement that &quot;Every graph G without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 subgraph is planar.&quot; Hmm. Let&#x27;s break this down step by step.

First, let me recall some basics. A planar graph is one that can be drawn on the plane without any edges crossing. Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem tells us that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K_5 (the complete graph on five vertices) or K_{3,3} (the complete bipartite graph on six vertices, split into two sets of three). However, the question here is about induced subgraphs, not subdivisions. So the original assertion is saying that if a graph doesn&#x27;t have K_{3,3} or K_5 as an induced subgraph, then it must be planar. If the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have these as induced subgraphs but is itself non-planar, then it would be a counterexample.

Alright, so let me recall the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s a well-known non-planar graph. I remember that it doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but wait, does it contain them as induced subgraphs? That&#x27;s the key here. The original assertion is about induced subgraphs, so even if the Petersen graph had a K_{3,3} or K_5 as a subgraph but not induced, it wouldn&#x27;t matter. The question is specifically about induced ones.

Let me confirm. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges. It&#x27;s a cubic graph (each vertex has degree 3). K_5 has 10 edges and is a complete graph, so each vertex has degree 4. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, it can&#x27;t contain K_5 as a subgraph because you can&#x27;t have a vertex with degree 4 in a cubic graph. Similarly, K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph with each vertex of degree 3. So maybe K_{3,3} could be a subgraph? But again, the question is about induced subgraphs.

An induced subgraph is a subset of the vertices of a graph together with all the edges whose endpoints are both in this subset. So even if the Petersen graph has a subgraph isomorphic to K_{3,3}, unless all the edges present in K_{3,3} between those vertices are also present in the Petersen graph, it&#x27;s not an induced subgraph.

Let me check if the Petersen graph contains an induced K_{3,3}. The Petersen graph is known to be non-planar, but according to Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem, it must contain a subdivision of K_5 or K_{3,3}. Indeed, the Petersen graph is a famous example of a non-planar graph that doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but it does contain a subdivision of K_{3,3}. However, a subdivision is different from an induced subgraph. Subdividing edges adds new vertices on the edges, so a subdivided K_{3,3} would not be an induced subgraph because the original edges are split into paths.

Therefore, the Petersen graph itself is non-planar, but does it contain an induced K_5 or K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s check K_5 first. As mentioned, all vertices in the Petersen graph have degree 3, but in K_5, every vertex has degree 4. So even if you take any 5 vertices in the Petersen graph, they can&#x27;t form a K_5 because the degrees are insufficient. So, there&#x27;s no induced K_5.

What about K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s see. K_{3,3} is bipartite, with two partitions each containing three vertices, and every vertex in one partition connected to every vertex in the other. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex has degree 3. If there was an induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph, each vertex in one partition would need to be connected to all three vertices in the other partition. But since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex can only have three edges. However, in K_{3,3}, each vertex is connected to three vertices in the opposite partition. So, if a vertex in the induced subgraph is part of the K_{3,3}, all its neighbors in the Petersen graph must be within the K_{3,3} as well. But in the Petersen graph, the neighborhoods are structured such that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let me try to visualize the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s usually drawn as a pentagon connected to a pentagram, with each vertex of the pentagon connected to a corresponding vertex of the pentagram. Each vertex is connected to three others: two in its own pentagon/pentagram and one in the other.

Suppose we try to find an induced K_{3,3}. Let&#x27;s take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices and one outer vertex. If we pick three outer vertices and three inner ones, perhaps we can form a bipartition. However, in the Petersen graph, each outer vertex is connected to only one inner vertex, and each inner vertex is connected to only one outer vertex. So, for example, if we take three outer vertices and their corresponding three inner vertices (each connected by a spoke), the edges between the outer and inner vertices would only be the three spokes. But in K_{3,3}, every outer vertex must connect to every inner vertex. In this case, each outer vertex is only connected to one inner vertex, so that&#x27;s only three edges between the partitions, whereas K_{3,3} would require nine edges (3x3). So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Alternatively, maybe if we select different sets of three vertices. Let me think. Since the Petersen graph is symmetric, any selection of six vertices should be similar. Suppose we try to find a bipartite induced subgraph with partitions of size three and three. The problem is that in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let&#x27;s say we pick three vertices from one partition. Each needs to be connected to all three in the other partition. But given the structure of the Petersen graph, each vertex is only connected to three others. If a vertex is in one partition, to connect to all three in the other partition, that would require three edges. But if the other partition has three vertices, each of those would need to connect back to all three in the first partition. However, each vertex in the other partition is already connected to two others in their own partition (if they are on the pentagon or pentagram) and one in the opposite. So they can&#x27;t have three edges to the first partition. Hence, it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph.

Therefore, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as an induced subgraph. Thus, it would serve as a counterexample to the assertion that every graph without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 is planar.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in reasoning about K_{3,3}. Let me try to see if there is a subset of six vertices in the Petersen graph that induce a K_{3,3}. Take the Petersen graph and label the outer pentagon vertices as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 and the inner pentagram vertices as u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, where each ui is connected to vi. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices (in the pentagram) and one outer vertex. So, suppose we take three outer vertices, say v1, v2, v3, and three inner vertices, say u4, u5, u1. Wait, u1 is connected to v1. Let&#x27;s see. The connections between the outer and inner vertices are only the spokes, so v1 is connected to u1, v2 to u2, etc. If we take v1, v2, v3 from the outer and u4, u5, u1 from the inner, then v1 is connected to u1, v2 is connected to u2 (which is not in the set), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set). So, in this subset, the only edges between the outer and inner are v1-u1. The rest of the edges would be the outer edges (v1-v2, v2-v3, v3-v4, etc.), but since we took only v1, v2, v3, the outer edges are v1-v2, v2-v3. The inner vertices u4, u5, u1: in the inner pentagram, u4 is connected to u5 and u3, but u3 isn&#x27;t in the set. u5 is connected to u4 and u1. u1 is connected to u5 and u2 (which isn&#x27;t in the set). So within the inner subset, u4 is connected to u5, u5 is connected to u1, and u1 is connected to no one else in the inner subset. So the induced subgraph on these six vertices would have edges: between outer vertices: v1-v2, v2-v3; between inner vertices: u4-u5, u5-u1; and the spoke edge v1-u1. That&#x27;s nothing like K_{3,3}; it&#x27;s missing almost all the edges.

Alternatively, pick six vertices in some other way. Maybe three from the outer and three from the inner, but not corresponding. For example, take v1, v3, v5 from the outer and u2, u4, u5 from the inner. Let&#x27;s check edges. The outer edges: v1 connected to v2 and v5 (but v2 and v5 are not in the set), so v1 only connected to v5. Wait, no, in the outer pentagon, v1 is connected to v2 and v5. But if we take v1, v3, v5, then v1 is connected to v5 (since they&#x27;re adjacent on the pentagon), v3 is connected to v4 and v2 (neither in the set), and v5 is connected to v1 and v4 (not in the set). So the outer subset has edges v1-v5. The inner subset u2, u4, u5: u2 is connected to u1 and u3 (not in the set), u4 is connected to u3 and u5, u5 is connected to u4 and u1 (not in the set). So u4-u5 is an edge. Between the outer and inner: v1 connected to u1 (not in the inner subset), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set), v5 connected to u5. So only v5-u5 is an edge. So the induced subgraph has edges v1-v5, u4-u5, and v5-u5. That&#x27;s just a triangle? Wait, no. v1 is connected to v5, v5 is connected to u5, and u5 is connected to u4. So it&#x27;s a path of three edges. Not K_{3,3}.

Hmm. Maybe trying different combinations. Alternatively, maybe pick vertices not all from outer and inner. Wait, but the Petersen graph is symmetric, so it shouldn&#x27;t matter. But perhaps if I pick vertices that form a 6-cycle or something. Wait, the Petersen graph has girth 5, so there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So any induced subgraph with a 6-cycle would have to be a hexagon, but the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have a 6-cycle. Wait, actually, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5 and 6? Wait, no, the girth is 5, meaning the shortest cycle is 5. So any cycle of length 6 would have to be a longer cycle. Wait, but can you even get a 6-cycle in the Petersen graph?

Wait, let me check. In the standard Petersen graph, if you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. The inner pentagram is also a 5-cycle. If you traverse the spokes, you can get longer cycles. For example, starting at v1, go to u1, then to u2, then to v2, then to v3, then to u3, then to u4, then to v4, etc. But I think the cycles are either of length 5 or longer. But does it have a 6-cycle? Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1, go to v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, back to v1. Wait, is that a cycle? v1 to v2 (outer edge), v2 to v3 (outer edge), v3 to u3 (spoke), u3 to u4 (inner edge), u4 to v4 (spoke), v4 to v1 (outer edge). That&#x27;s a 6-cycle: v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1. But wait, does this form a cycle? Let&#x27;s check the connections:

v1 adjacent to v2: yes.

v2 adjacent to v3: yes.

v3 adjacent to u3: yes.

u3 adjacent to u4: in the inner pentagon, u3 is adjacent to u4 and u2, yes.

u4 adjacent to v4: yes.

v4 adjacent to v1: yes, if in the outer pentagon, v4 is adjacent to v5 and v3. Wait, no. Wait, the outer pentagon is v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, with each adjacent to the next. So v4 is adjacent to v3 and v5. So v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, the path v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1 is not a cycle because v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, that&#x27;s a 6-vertex path, but not a cycle.

Hmm. So maybe there&#x27;s no 6-cycle in the Petersen graph. Wait, but according to some references, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5, 6, 8, and 9, but I need to confirm. Let me think. If you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. If you take the inner pentagram, that&#x27;s another 5-cycle. For a 6-cycle, maybe traverse spokes and inner edges. For example: v1, u1, u2, v2, v3, u3, v1. Wait, but that would be v1 connected to u1, u1 connected to u2, u2 connected to v2, v2 connected to v3, v3 connected to u3, u3 connected to v1? Wait, u3 is not connected to v1. So that doesn&#x27;t form a cycle. Alternatively, v1, u1, u5, v5, v4, u4, v1. Let&#x27;s check: v1-u1, u1-u5 (inner edge), u5-v5, v5-v4, v4-u4, u4 connected to v1? No, u4 is connected to v4 and u3. So no. So maybe that&#x27;s not a cycle.

Alternatively, maybe another path. Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1: v1, v2, u2, u3, v3, v4, v1. But v4 is not connected to v1. Hmm. Maybe it&#x27;s not possible. Wait, actually, according to the properties of the Petersen graph, it is a 3-regular graph with girth 5, so the shortest cycle is 5, and it doesn&#x27;t have cycles of length 3 or 4. So perhaps there are cycles of length 6, but they are not induced cycles. Because an induced cycle would require that there are no chords, but in a 6-cycle, if there are chords, it&#x27;s not induced. Given that the Petersen graph is 3-regular, adding chords might complicate things. But since the girth is 5, there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So, a 6-cycle would have to be chordless, which would make it an induced cycle. But does such a cycle exist?

Wait, in the Petersen graph, can we find a 6-cycle? Let me check online in my mind. I recall that the Petersen graph does have cycles of length 6, but they are not induced. Wait, if the girth is 5, then any 6-cycle must have a chord, making it non-induced. Therefore, there are no induced 6-cycles. Therefore, any 6-vertex induced subgraph cannot be a cycle. So, perhaps the induced subgraphs on six vertices in the Petersen graph are not bipartite. But K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph. So, if the induced subgraph is not bipartite, it can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. Alternatively, even if it&#x27;s bipartite, it needs to be complete.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s take a different approach. Let&#x27;s check all possible 6-vertex induced subgraphs of the Petersen graph. Since the Petersen graph is small, maybe this is feasible. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices, so the number of 6-vertex induced subgraphs is C(10,6) = 210. That&#x27;s a lot, but maybe we can reason about their properties.

In an induced subgraph of six vertices, each vertex can have degree at most 3 (since the original graph is 3-regular). For it to be K_{3,3}, each vertex in one partition must have degree 3, connected to all three vertices in the other partition. So in total, each partition has three vertices, and all 9 edges are present between them. But in the induced subgraph, we need to have exactly those edges and no others.

But in the Petersen graph, any two adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Wait, no. Wait, in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. That&#x27;s a key property. Let me confirm. In the Petersen graph, if two vertices are non-adjacent, they have exactly one common neighbor. If they are adjacent, they have no common neighbors. Because it&#x27;s a strongly regular graph with parameters (10,3,0,1), which means each pair of adjacent vertices has 0 common neighbors, and each pair of non-adjacent vertices has 1 common neighbor.

Therefore, in the induced subgraph, if two vertices are adjacent in the Petersen graph, they have no common neighbors in the entire graph, so also in the induced subgraph. If two vertices are non-adjacent in the induced subgraph, they could be adjacent or non-adjacent in the whole graph. But if they are non-adjacent in the whole graph, they have one common neighbor in the whole graph, but that common neighbor might not be in the induced subgraph.

But let&#x27;s consider trying to form K_{3,3}. Suppose we have partitions A and B, each with three vertices. In K_{3,3}, every vertex in A is connected to every vertex in B, and there are no edges within A or within B. So in the induced subgraph, there should be no edges within A or within B, and all edges between A and B.

But in the Petersen graph, edges are arranged such that the outer pentagon and inner pentagram each have their own edges. Let&#x27;s think of the standard drawing. If we pick three vertices from the outer pentagon, they form a path or something. Each is connected to two others in the pentagon. So if we include three outer vertices, they have edges among themselves, which would violate the requirement of K_{3,3} having no edges within a partition. Similarly, three inner vertices would have edges among themselves. Therefore, if we pick three from the outer and three from the inner, the induced subgraph would have edges within the outer three, edges within the inner three, and some edges between them. But K_{3,3} has no edges within partitions. Therefore, such a subgraph would have extra edges, so it wouldn&#x27;t be a K_{3,3}.

Alternatively, maybe pick six vertices not split as three outer and three inner. But the Petersen graph is symmetric, so any six vertices would have a similar structure. Wait, but how else can you partition six vertices? Maybe two from outer, two from inner, and two others? But since the graph is symmetric, perhaps the induced subgraphs would still have edges within their groups.

Alternatively, consider another approach: the complement of the Petersen graph. But maybe that&#x27;s not helpful here.

Wait, another property: K_{3,3} has nine edges. The induced subgraph would need to have nine edges. Let&#x27;s calculate the number of edges in a 6-vertex induced subgraph of the Petersen graph. Each vertex has degree 3, but when you take an induced subgraph, each vertex can have degree between 0 and 3. The total number of edges in the induced subgraph can be calculated by summing the degrees and dividing by 2, but since we&#x27;re dealing with induced subgraphs, it&#x27;s just the number of edges present between those six vertices.

But how many edges can there be? Let&#x27;s see. In the entire Petersen graph, there are 15 edges. If we take six vertices, the maximum number of edges they can have is C(6,2) = 15, but obviously, the induced subgraph will have fewer since the Petersen graph isn&#x27;t complete. Given the regularity and structure, how many edges would a 6-vertex induced subgraph have?

Alternatively, since each vertex has degree 3, in the induced subgraph, each vertex can have at most 3 edges. But since the graph is 3-regular, each vertex has 3 edges in the whole graph. So in the induced subgraph, the degree of a vertex is the number of its neighbors that are also in the subgraph. So the number of edges in the induced subgraph would be half the sum of the degrees of the vertices within the subgraph. Since each vertex can contribute 0 to 3 edges, the total number of edges could be up to (6*3)/2 = 9, which is the number of edges in K_{3,3}. But is there an induced subgraph with 9 edges?

For that, each vertex in the subgraph would need to have degree 3 in the subgraph. But since the original graph is 3-regular, if a vertex has all three neighbors inside the subgraph, then it contributes 3 to the sum. If a vertex has, say, two neighbors inside the subgraph, it contributes 2, etc.

So to have 9 edges, the sum of degrees must be 18, but since each edge is counted twice, 9 edges correspond to sum of degrees 18. Therefore, each of the six vertices must have degree 3 in the induced subgraph, meaning each vertex is connected to all three others in the subgraph. But that would mean the induced subgraph is a 3-regular graph on six vertices. However, the only 3-regular graph on six vertices is the complete bipartite graph K_{3,3}, which is bipartite, and the complete tripartite graph... Wait, no. The 3-regular graphs on six vertices include K_{3,3} and the prism graph (two triangles connected by a matching), also known as the triangular prism, which is a 3-regular graph but not bipartite. So there are two 3-regular graphs on six vertices: K_{3,3} and the prism graph.

Therefore, if the induced subgraph is 3-regular, it could be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But in the Petersen graph, can we find an induced subgraph that&#x27;s 3-regular on six vertices? Let&#x27;s check.

If such a subgraph exists, it would need to be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But given the properties of the Petersen graph, like any two non-adjacent vertices having exactly one common neighbor, let&#x27;s see if a 3-regular induced subgraph is possible.

Suppose we have six vertices forming an induced subgraph. If it&#x27;s K_{3,3}, then it&#x27;s bipartite with partitions A and B. Each vertex in A is connected to all in B, and there are no edges within A or B. But in the Petersen graph, if we take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram, as before, they have edges within their own partitions. So that can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. If we take six vertices in some other configuration, perhaps?

Wait, the prism graph (two triangles connected by edges) is another 3-regular graph on six vertices. Let&#x27;s see if that exists as an induced subgraph in the Petersen graph. The prism graph has two triangles, each triangle being a 3-cycle. But the Petersen graph has girth 5, so it has no 3-cycles. Therefore, the prism graph cannot be a subgraph of the Petersen graph, induced or otherwise. Therefore, the only possible 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices would be K_{3,3}. But since the prism graph is excluded due to the girth, and K_{3,3} would require no edges within each partition, but any three vertices in the Petersen graph would have edges among themselves if they are from the outer or inner cycles.

Therefore, it&#x27;s impossible to have a 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices in the Petersen graph. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph. Thus, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph without induced K_5 or K_{3,3}, making it a counterexample to the original assertion.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample to refute the assertion that &quot;Every graph \( G \) without an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \) subgraph is planar,&quot; we need to check the following:

1. **Planarity of the Petersen Graph**: The Petersen graph is a well-known non-planar graph.
2. **Induced Subgraphs**: We need to verify if the Petersen graph contains an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \).

**Key Points**:
- The Petersen graph is non-planar.
- The Petersen graph is cubic (each vertex has degree 3), so it cannot contain \( K_5 \) as a subgraph (since \( K_5 \) requires each vertex to have degree 4).
- The Petersen graph does not contain \( K_{3,3} \) as an induced subgraph. This is because any induced subgraph of six vertices in the Petersen graph cannot be bipartite with all edges present between the two partitions (as required for \( K_{3,3} \)). The structure of the Petersen graph, with its girth of 5 and the property that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor, prevents the existence of such an induced subgraph.

**Conclusion**:
The Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \). Therefore, it serves as a counterexample to the given assertion.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the Petersen graph can be a counterexample to the statement that &quot;Every graph G without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 subgraph is planar.&quot; Hmm. Let&#x27;s break this down step by step.

First, let me recall some basics. A planar graph is one that can be drawn on the plane without any edges crossing. Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem tells us that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K_5 (the complete graph on five vertices) or K_{3,3} (the complete bipartite graph on six vertices, split into two sets of three). However, the question here is about induced subgraphs, not subdivisions. So the original assertion is saying that if a graph doesn&#x27;t have K_{3,3} or K_5 as an induced subgraph, then it must be planar. If the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have these as induced subgraphs but is itself non-planar, then it would be a counterexample.

Alright, so let me recall the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s a well-known non-planar graph. I remember that it doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but wait, does it contain them as induced subgraphs? That&#x27;s the key here. The original assertion is about induced subgraphs, so even if the Petersen graph had a K_{3,3} or K_5 as a subgraph but not induced, it wouldn&#x27;t matter. The question is specifically about induced ones.

Let me confirm. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges. It&#x27;s a cubic graph (each vertex has degree 3). K_5 has 10 edges and is a complete graph, so each vertex has degree 4. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, it can&#x27;t contain K_5 as a subgraph because you can&#x27;t have a vertex with degree 4 in a cubic graph. Similarly, K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph with each vertex of degree 3. So maybe K_{3,3} could be a subgraph? But again, the question is about induced subgraphs.

An induced subgraph is a subset of the vertices of a graph together with all the edges whose endpoints are both in this subset. So even if the Petersen graph has a subgraph isomorphic to K_{3,3}, unless all the edges present in K_{3,3} between those vertices are also present in the Petersen graph, it&#x27;s not an induced subgraph.

Let me check if the Petersen graph contains an induced K_{3,3}. The Petersen graph is known to be non-planar, but according to Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem, it must contain a subdivision of K_5 or K_{3,3}. Indeed, the Petersen graph is a famous example of a non-planar graph that doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but it does contain a subdivision of K_{3,3}. However, a subdivision is different from an induced subgraph. Subdividing edges adds new vertices on the edges, so a subdivided K_{3,3} would not be an induced subgraph because the original edges are split into paths.

Therefore, the Petersen graph itself is non-planar, but does it contain an induced K_5 or K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s check K_5 first. As mentioned, all vertices in the Petersen graph have degree 3, but in K_5, every vertex has degree 4. So even if you take any 5 vertices in the Petersen graph, they can&#x27;t form a K_5 because the degrees are insufficient. So, there&#x27;s no induced K_5.

What about K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s see. K_{3,3} is bipartite, with two partitions each containing three vertices, and every vertex in one partition connected to every vertex in the other. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex has degree 3. If there was an induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph, each vertex in one partition would need to be connected to all three vertices in the other partition. But since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex can only have three edges. However, in K_{3,3}, each vertex is connected to three vertices in the opposite partition. So, if a vertex in the induced subgraph is part of the K_{3,3}, all its neighbors in the Petersen graph must be within the K_{3,3} as well. But in the Petersen graph, the neighborhoods are structured such that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let me try to visualize the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s usually drawn as a pentagon connected to a pentagram, with each vertex of the pentagon connected to a corresponding vertex of the pentagram. Each vertex is connected to three others: two in its own pentagon/pentagram and one in the other.

Suppose we try to find an induced K_{3,3}. Let&#x27;s take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices and one outer vertex. If we pick three outer vertices and three inner ones, perhaps we can form a bipartition. However, in the Petersen graph, each outer vertex is connected to only one inner vertex, and each inner vertex is connected to only one outer vertex. So, for example, if we take three outer vertices and their corresponding three inner vertices (each connected by a spoke), the edges between the outer and inner vertices would only be the three spokes. But in K_{3,3}, every outer vertex must connect to every inner vertex. In this case, each outer vertex is only connected to one inner vertex, so that&#x27;s only three edges between the partitions, whereas K_{3,3} would require nine edges (3x3). So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Alternatively, maybe if we select different sets of three vertices. Let me think. Since the Petersen graph is symmetric, any selection of six vertices should be similar. Suppose we try to find a bipartite induced subgraph with partitions of size three and three. The problem is that in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let&#x27;s say we pick three vertices from one partition. Each needs to be connected to all three in the other partition. But given the structure of the Petersen graph, each vertex is only connected to three others. If a vertex is in one partition, to connect to all three in the other partition, that would require three edges. But if the other partition has three vertices, each of those would need to connect back to all three in the first partition. However, each vertex in the other partition is already connected to two others in their own partition (if they are on the pentagon or pentagram) and one in the opposite. So they can&#x27;t have three edges to the first partition. Hence, it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph.

Therefore, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as an induced subgraph. Thus, it would serve as a counterexample to the assertion that every graph without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 is planar.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in reasoning about K_{3,3}. Let me try to see if there is a subset of six vertices in the Petersen graph that induce a K_{3,3}. Take the Petersen graph and label the outer pentagon vertices as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 and the inner pentagram vertices as u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, where each ui is connected to vi. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices (in the pentagram) and one outer vertex. So, suppose we take three outer vertices, say v1, v2, v3, and three inner vertices, say u4, u5, u1. Wait, u1 is connected to v1. Let&#x27;s see. The connections between the outer and inner vertices are only the spokes, so v1 is connected to u1, v2 to u2, etc. If we take v1, v2, v3 from the outer and u4, u5, u1 from the inner, then v1 is connected to u1, v2 is connected to u2 (which is not in the set), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set). So, in this subset, the only edges between the outer and inner are v1-u1. The rest of the edges would be the outer edges (v1-v2, v2-v3, v3-v4, etc.), but since we took only v1, v2, v3, the outer edges are v1-v2, v2-v3. The inner vertices u4, u5, u1: in the inner pentagram, u4 is connected to u5 and u3, but u3 isn&#x27;t in the set. u5 is connected to u4 and u1. u1 is connected to u5 and u2 (which isn&#x27;t in the set). So within the inner subset, u4 is connected to u5, u5 is connected to u1, and u1 is connected to no one else in the inner subset. So the induced subgraph on these six vertices would have edges: between outer vertices: v1-v2, v2-v3; between inner vertices: u4-u5, u5-u1; and the spoke edge v1-u1. That&#x27;s nothing like K_{3,3}; it&#x27;s missing almost all the edges.

Alternatively, pick six vertices in some other way. Maybe three from the outer and three from the inner, but not corresponding. For example, take v1, v3, v5 from the outer and u2, u4, u5 from the inner. Let&#x27;s check edges. The outer edges: v1 connected to v2 and v5 (but v2 and v5 are not in the set), so v1 only connected to v5. Wait, no, in the outer pentagon, v1 is connected to v2 and v5. But if we take v1, v3, v5, then v1 is connected to v5 (since they&#x27;re adjacent on the pentagon), v3 is connected to v4 and v2 (neither in the set), and v5 is connected to v1 and v4 (not in the set). So the outer subset has edges v1-v5. The inner subset u2, u4, u5: u2 is connected to u1 and u3 (not in the set), u4 is connected to u3 and u5, u5 is connected to u4 and u1 (not in the set). So u4-u5 is an edge. Between the outer and inner: v1 connected to u1 (not in the inner subset), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set), v5 connected to u5. So only v5-u5 is an edge. So the induced subgraph has edges v1-v5, u4-u5, and v5-u5. That&#x27;s just a triangle? Wait, no. v1 is connected to v5, v5 is connected to u5, and u5 is connected to u4. So it&#x27;s a path of three edges. Not K_{3,3}.

Hmm. Maybe trying different combinations. Alternatively, maybe pick vertices not all from outer and inner. Wait, but the Petersen graph is symmetric, so it shouldn&#x27;t matter. But perhaps if I pick vertices that form a 6-cycle or something. Wait, the Petersen graph has girth 5, so there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So any induced subgraph with a 6-cycle would have to be a hexagon, but the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have a 6-cycle. Wait, actually, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5 and 6? Wait, no, the girth is 5, meaning the shortest cycle is 5. So any cycle of length 6 would have to be a longer cycle. Wait, but can you even get a 6-cycle in the Petersen graph?

Wait, let me check. In the standard Petersen graph, if you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. The inner pentagram is also a 5-cycle. If you traverse the spokes, you can get longer cycles. For example, starting at v1, go to u1, then to u2, then to v2, then to v3, then to u3, then to u4, then to v4, etc. But I think the cycles are either of length 5 or longer. But does it have a 6-cycle? Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1, go to v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, back to v1. Wait, is that a cycle? v1 to v2 (outer edge), v2 to v3 (outer edge), v3 to u3 (spoke), u3 to u4 (inner edge), u4 to v4 (spoke), v4 to v1 (outer edge). That&#x27;s a 6-cycle: v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1. But wait, does this form a cycle? Let&#x27;s check the connections:

v1 adjacent to v2: yes.

v2 adjacent to v3: yes.

v3 adjacent to u3: yes.

u3 adjacent to u4: in the inner pentagon, u3 is adjacent to u4 and u2, yes.

u4 adjacent to v4: yes.

v4 adjacent to v1: yes, if in the outer pentagon, v4 is adjacent to v5 and v3. Wait, no. Wait, the outer pentagon is v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, with each adjacent to the next. So v4 is adjacent to v3 and v5. So v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, the path v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1 is not a cycle because v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, that&#x27;s a 6-vertex path, but not a cycle.

Hmm. So maybe there&#x27;s no 6-cycle in the Petersen graph. Wait, but according to some references, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5, 6, 8, and 9, but I need to confirm. Let me think. If you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. If you take the inner pentagram, that&#x27;s another 5-cycle. For a 6-cycle, maybe traverse spokes and inner edges. For example: v1, u1, u2, v2, v3, u3, v1. Wait, but that would be v1 connected to u1, u1 connected to u2, u2 connected to v2, v2 connected to v3, v3 connected to u3, u3 connected to v1? Wait, u3 is not connected to v1. So that doesn&#x27;t form a cycle. Alternatively, v1, u1, u5, v5, v4, u4, v1. Let&#x27;s check: v1-u1, u1-u5 (inner edge), u5-v5, v5-v4, v4-u4, u4 connected to v1? No, u4 is connected to v4 and u3. So no. So maybe that&#x27;s not a cycle.

Alternatively, maybe another path. Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1: v1, v2, u2, u3, v3, v4, v1. But v4 is not connected to v1. Hmm. Maybe it&#x27;s not possible. Wait, actually, according to the properties of the Petersen graph, it is a 3-regular graph with girth 5, so the shortest cycle is 5, and it doesn&#x27;t have cycles of length 3 or 4. So perhaps there are cycles of length 6, but they are not induced cycles. Because an induced cycle would require that there are no chords, but in a 6-cycle, if there are chords, it&#x27;s not induced. Given that the Petersen graph is 3-regular, adding chords might complicate things. But since the girth is 5, there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So, a 6-cycle would have to be chordless, which would make it an induced cycle. But does such a cycle exist?

Wait, in the Petersen graph, can we find a 6-cycle? Let me check online in my mind. I recall that the Petersen graph does have cycles of length 6, but they are not induced. Wait, if the girth is 5, then any 6-cycle must have a chord, making it non-induced. Therefore, there are no induced 6-cycles. Therefore, any 6-vertex induced subgraph cannot be a cycle. So, perhaps the induced subgraphs on six vertices in the Petersen graph are not bipartite. But K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph. So, if the induced subgraph is not bipartite, it can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. Alternatively, even if it&#x27;s bipartite, it needs to be complete.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s take a different approach. Let&#x27;s check all possible 6-vertex induced subgraphs of the Petersen graph. Since the Petersen graph is small, maybe this is feasible. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices, so the number of 6-vertex induced subgraphs is C(10,6) = 210. That&#x27;s a lot, but maybe we can reason about their properties.

In an induced subgraph of six vertices, each vertex can have degree at most 3 (since the original graph is 3-regular). For it to be K_{3,3}, each vertex in one partition must have degree 3, connected to all three vertices in the other partition. So in total, each partition has three vertices, and all 9 edges are present between them. But in the induced subgraph, we need to have exactly those edges and no others.

But in the Petersen graph, any two adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Wait, no. Wait, in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. That&#x27;s a key property. Let me confirm. In the Petersen graph, if two vertices are non-adjacent, they have exactly one common neighbor. If they are adjacent, they have no common neighbors. Because it&#x27;s a strongly regular graph with parameters (10,3,0,1), which means each pair of adjacent vertices has 0 common neighbors, and each pair of non-adjacent vertices has 1 common neighbor.

Therefore, in the induced subgraph, if two vertices are adjacent in the Petersen graph, they have no common neighbors in the entire graph, so also in the induced subgraph. If two vertices are non-adjacent in the induced subgraph, they could be adjacent or non-adjacent in the whole graph. But if they are non-adjacent in the whole graph, they have one common neighbor in the whole graph, but that common neighbor might not be in the induced subgraph.

But let&#x27;s consider trying to form K_{3,3}. Suppose we have partitions A and B, each with three vertices. In K_{3,3}, every vertex in A is connected to every vertex in B, and there are no edges within A or within B. So in the induced subgraph, there should be no edges within A or within B, and all edges between A and B.

But in the Petersen graph, edges are arranged such that the outer pentagon and inner pentagram each have their own edges. Let&#x27;s think of the standard drawing. If we pick three vertices from the outer pentagon, they form a path or something. Each is connected to two others in the pentagon. So if we include three outer vertices, they have edges among themselves, which would violate the requirement of K_{3,3} having no edges within a partition. Similarly, three inner vertices would have edges among themselves. Therefore, if we pick three from the outer and three from the inner, the induced subgraph would have edges within the outer three, edges within the inner three, and some edges between them. But K_{3,3} has no edges within partitions. Therefore, such a subgraph would have extra edges, so it wouldn&#x27;t be a K_{3,3}.

Alternatively, maybe pick six vertices not split as three outer and three inner. But the Petersen graph is symmetric, so any six vertices would have a similar structure. Wait, but how else can you partition six vertices? Maybe two from outer, two from inner, and two others? But since the graph is symmetric, perhaps the induced subgraphs would still have edges within their groups.

Alternatively, consider another approach: the complement of the Petersen graph. But maybe that&#x27;s not helpful here.

Wait, another property: K_{3,3} has nine edges. The induced subgraph would need to have nine edges. Let&#x27;s calculate the number of edges in a 6-vertex induced subgraph of the Petersen graph. Each vertex has degree 3, but when you take an induced subgraph, each vertex can have degree between 0 and 3. The total number of edges in the induced subgraph can be calculated by summing the degrees and dividing by 2, but since we&#x27;re dealing with induced subgraphs, it&#x27;s just the number of edges present between those six vertices.

But how many edges can there be? Let&#x27;s see. In the entire Petersen graph, there are 15 edges. If we take six vertices, the maximum number of edges they can have is C(6,2) = 15, but obviously, the induced subgraph will have fewer since the Petersen graph isn&#x27;t complete. Given the regularity and structure, how many edges would a 6-vertex induced subgraph have?

Alternatively, since each vertex has degree 3, in the induced subgraph, each vertex can have at most 3 edges. But since the graph is 3-regular, each vertex has 3 edges in the whole graph. So in the induced subgraph, the degree of a vertex is the number of its neighbors that are also in the subgraph. So the number of edges in the induced subgraph would be half the sum of the degrees of the vertices within the subgraph. Since each vertex can contribute 0 to 3 edges, the total number of edges could be up to (6*3)/2 = 9, which is the number of edges in K_{3,3}. But is there an induced subgraph with 9 edges?

For that, each vertex in the subgraph would need to have degree 3 in the subgraph. But since the original graph is 3-regular, if a vertex has all three neighbors inside the subgraph, then it contributes 3 to the sum. If a vertex has, say, two neighbors inside the subgraph, it contributes 2, etc.

So to have 9 edges, the sum of degrees must be 18, but since each edge is counted twice, 9 edges correspond to sum of degrees 18. Therefore, each of the six vertices must have degree 3 in the induced subgraph, meaning each vertex is connected to all three others in the subgraph. But that would mean the induced subgraph is a 3-regular graph on six vertices. However, the only 3-regular graph on six vertices is the complete bipartite graph K_{3,3}, which is bipartite, and the complete tripartite graph... Wait, no. The 3-regular graphs on six vertices include K_{3,3} and the prism graph (two triangles connected by a matching), also known as the triangular prism, which is a 3-regular graph but not bipartite. So there are two 3-regular graphs on six vertices: K_{3,3} and the prism graph.

Therefore, if the induced subgraph is 3-regular, it could be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But in the Petersen graph, can we find an induced subgraph that&#x27;s 3-regular on six vertices? Let&#x27;s check.

If such a subgraph exists, it would need to be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But given the properties of the Petersen graph, like any two non-adjacent vertices having exactly one common neighbor, let&#x27;s see if a 3-regular induced subgraph is possible.

Suppose we have six vertices forming an induced subgraph. If it&#x27;s K_{3,3}, then it&#x27;s bipartite with partitions A and B. Each vertex in A is connected to all in B, and there are no edges within A or B. But in the Petersen graph, if we take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram, as before, they have edges within their own partitions. So that can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. If we take six vertices in some other configuration, perhaps?

Wait, the prism graph (two triangles connected by edges) is another 3-regular graph on six vertices. Let&#x27;s see if that exists as an induced subgraph in the Petersen graph. The prism graph has two triangles, each triangle being a 3-cycle. But the Petersen graph has girth 5, so it has no 3-cycles. Therefore, the prism graph cannot be a subgraph of the Petersen graph, induced or otherwise. Therefore, the only possible 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices would be K_{3,3}. But since the prism graph is excluded due to the girth, and K_{3,3} would require no edges within each partition, but any three vertices in the Petersen graph would have edges among themselves if they are from the outer or inner cycles.

Therefore, it&#x27;s impossible to have a 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices in the Petersen graph. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph. Thus, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph without induced K_5 or K_{3,3}, making it a counterexample to the original assertion.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample to refute the assertion that &quot;Every graph \( G \) without an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \) subgraph is planar,&quot; we need to check the following:

1. **Planarity of the Petersen Graph**: The Petersen graph is a well-known non-planar graph.
2. **Induced Subgraphs**: We need to verify if the Petersen graph contains an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \).

**Key Points**:
- The Petersen graph is non-planar.
- The Petersen graph is cubic (each vertex has degree 3), so it cannot contain \( K_5 \) as a subgraph (since \( K_5 \) requires each vertex to have degree 4).
- The Petersen graph does not contain \( K_{3,3} \) as an induced subgraph. This is because any induced subgraph of six vertices in the Petersen graph cannot be bipartite with all edges present between the two partitions (as required for \( K_{3,3} \)). The structure of the Petersen graph, with its girth of 5 and the property that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor, prevents the existence of such an induced subgraph.

**Conclusion**:
The Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \). Therefore, it serves as a counterexample to the given assertion.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the Petersen graph can be a counterexample to the statement that &quot;Every graph G without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 subgraph is planar.&quot; Hmm. Let&#x27;s break this down step by step.

First, let me recall some basics. A planar graph is one that can be drawn on the plane without any edges crossing. Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem tells us that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K_5 (the complete graph on five vertices) or K_{3,3} (the complete bipartite graph on six vertices, split into two sets of three). However, the question here is about induced subgraphs, not subdivisions. So the original assertion is saying that if a graph doesn&#x27;t have K_{3,3} or K_5 as an induced subgraph, then it must be planar. If the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have these as induced subgraphs but is itself non-planar, then it would be a counterexample.

Alright, so let me recall the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s a well-known non-planar graph. I remember that it doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but wait, does it contain them as induced subgraphs? That&#x27;s the key here. The original assertion is about induced subgraphs, so even if the Petersen graph had a K_{3,3} or K_5 as a subgraph but not induced, it wouldn&#x27;t matter. The question is specifically about induced ones.

Let me confirm. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges. It&#x27;s a cubic graph (each vertex has degree 3). K_5 has 10 edges and is a complete graph, so each vertex has degree 4. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, it can&#x27;t contain K_5 as a subgraph because you can&#x27;t have a vertex with degree 4 in a cubic graph. Similarly, K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph with each vertex of degree 3. So maybe K_{3,3} could be a subgraph? But again, the question is about induced subgraphs.

An induced subgraph is a subset of the vertices of a graph together with all the edges whose endpoints are both in this subset. So even if the Petersen graph has a subgraph isomorphic to K_{3,3}, unless all the edges present in K_{3,3} between those vertices are also present in the Petersen graph, it&#x27;s not an induced subgraph.

Let me check if the Petersen graph contains an induced K_{3,3}. The Petersen graph is known to be non-planar, but according to Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem, it must contain a subdivision of K_5 or K_{3,3}. Indeed, the Petersen graph is a famous example of a non-planar graph that doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but it does contain a subdivision of K_{3,3}. However, a subdivision is different from an induced subgraph. Subdividing edges adds new vertices on the edges, so a subdivided K_{3,3} would not be an induced subgraph because the original edges are split into paths.

Therefore, the Petersen graph itself is non-planar, but does it contain an induced K_5 or K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s check K_5 first. As mentioned, all vertices in the Petersen graph have degree 3, but in K_5, every vertex has degree 4. So even if you take any 5 vertices in the Petersen graph, they can&#x27;t form a K_5 because the degrees are insufficient. So, there&#x27;s no induced K_5.

What about K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s see. K_{3,3} is bipartite, with two partitions each containing three vertices, and every vertex in one partition connected to every vertex in the other. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex has degree 3. If there was an induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph, each vertex in one partition would need to be connected to all three vertices in the other partition. But since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex can only have three edges. However, in K_{3,3}, each vertex is connected to three vertices in the opposite partition. So, if a vertex in the induced subgraph is part of the K_{3,3}, all its neighbors in the Petersen graph must be within the K_{3,3} as well. But in the Petersen graph, the neighborhoods are structured such that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let me try to visualize the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s usually drawn as a pentagon connected to a pentagram, with each vertex of the pentagon connected to a corresponding vertex of the pentagram. Each vertex is connected to three others: two in its own pentagon/pentagram and one in the other.

Suppose we try to find an induced K_{3,3}. Let&#x27;s take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices and one outer vertex. If we pick three outer vertices and three inner ones, perhaps we can form a bipartition. However, in the Petersen graph, each outer vertex is connected to only one inner vertex, and each inner vertex is connected to only one outer vertex. So, for example, if we take three outer vertices and their corresponding three inner vertices (each connected by a spoke), the edges between the outer and inner vertices would only be the three spokes. But in K_{3,3}, every outer vertex must connect to every inner vertex. In this case, each outer vertex is only connected to one inner vertex, so that&#x27;s only three edges between the partitions, whereas K_{3,3} would require nine edges (3x3). So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Alternatively, maybe if we select different sets of three vertices. Let me think. Since the Petersen graph is symmetric, any selection of six vertices should be similar. Suppose we try to find a bipartite induced subgraph with partitions of size three and three. The problem is that in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let&#x27;s say we pick three vertices from one partition. Each needs to be connected to all three in the other partition. But given the structure of the Petersen graph, each vertex is only connected to three others. If a vertex is in one partition, to connect to all three in the other partition, that would require three edges. But if the other partition has three vertices, each of those would need to connect back to all three in the first partition. However, each vertex in the other partition is already connected to two others in their own partition (if they are on the pentagon or pentagram) and one in the opposite. So they can&#x27;t have three edges to the first partition. Hence, it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph.

Therefore, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as an induced subgraph. Thus, it would serve as a counterexample to the assertion that every graph without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 is planar.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in reasoning about K_{3,3}. Let me try to see if there is a subset of six vertices in the Petersen graph that induce a K_{3,3}. Take the Petersen graph and label the outer pentagon vertices as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 and the inner pentagram vertices as u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, where each ui is connected to vi. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices (in the pentagram) and one outer vertex. So, suppose we take three outer vertices, say v1, v2, v3, and three inner vertices, say u4, u5, u1. Wait, u1 is connected to v1. Let&#x27;s see. The connections between the outer and inner vertices are only the spokes, so v1 is connected to u1, v2 to u2, etc. If we take v1, v2, v3 from the outer and u4, u5, u1 from the inner, then v1 is connected to u1, v2 is connected to u2 (which is not in the set), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set). So, in this subset, the only edges between the outer and inner are v1-u1. The rest of the edges would be the outer edges (v1-v2, v2-v3, v3-v4, etc.), but since we took only v1, v2, v3, the outer edges are v1-v2, v2-v3. The inner vertices u4, u5, u1: in the inner pentagram, u4 is connected to u5 and u3, but u3 isn&#x27;t in the set. u5 is connected to u4 and u1. u1 is connected to u5 and u2 (which isn&#x27;t in the set). So within the inner subset, u4 is connected to u5, u5 is connected to u1, and u1 is connected to no one else in the inner subset. So the induced subgraph on these six vertices would have edges: between outer vertices: v1-v2, v2-v3; between inner vertices: u4-u5, u5-u1; and the spoke edge v1-u1. That&#x27;s nothing like K_{3,3}; it&#x27;s missing almost all the edges.

Alternatively, pick six vertices in some other way. Maybe three from the outer and three from the inner, but not corresponding. For example, take v1, v3, v5 from the outer and u2, u4, u5 from the inner. Let&#x27;s check edges. The outer edges: v1 connected to v2 and v5 (but v2 and v5 are not in the set), so v1 only connected to v5. Wait, no, in the outer pentagon, v1 is connected to v2 and v5. But if we take v1, v3, v5, then v1 is connected to v5 (since they&#x27;re adjacent on the pentagon), v3 is connected to v4 and v2 (neither in the set), and v5 is connected to v1 and v4 (not in the set). So the outer subset has edges v1-v5. The inner subset u2, u4, u5: u2 is connected to u1 and u3 (not in the set), u4 is connected to u3 and u5, u5 is connected to u4 and u1 (not in the set). So u4-u5 is an edge. Between the outer and inner: v1 connected to u1 (not in the inner subset), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set), v5 connected to u5. So only v5-u5 is an edge. So the induced subgraph has edges v1-v5, u4-u5, and v5-u5. That&#x27;s just a triangle? Wait, no. v1 is connected to v5, v5 is connected to u5, and u5 is connected to u4. So it&#x27;s a path of three edges. Not K_{3,3}.

Hmm. Maybe trying different combinations. Alternatively, maybe pick vertices not all from outer and inner. Wait, but the Petersen graph is symmetric, so it shouldn&#x27;t matter. But perhaps if I pick vertices that form a 6-cycle or something. Wait, the Petersen graph has girth 5, so there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So any induced subgraph with a 6-cycle would have to be a hexagon, but the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have a 6-cycle. Wait, actually, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5 and 6? Wait, no, the girth is 5, meaning the shortest cycle is 5. So any cycle of length 6 would have to be a longer cycle. Wait, but can you even get a 6-cycle in the Petersen graph?

Wait, let me check. In the standard Petersen graph, if you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. The inner pentagram is also a 5-cycle. If you traverse the spokes, you can get longer cycles. For example, starting at v1, go to u1, then to u2, then to v2, then to v3, then to u3, then to u4, then to v4, etc. But I think the cycles are either of length 5 or longer. But does it have a 6-cycle? Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1, go to v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, back to v1. Wait, is that a cycle? v1 to v2 (outer edge), v2 to v3 (outer edge), v3 to u3 (spoke), u3 to u4 (inner edge), u4 to v4 (spoke), v4 to v1 (outer edge). That&#x27;s a 6-cycle: v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1. But wait, does this form a cycle? Let&#x27;s check the connections:

v1 adjacent to v2: yes.

v2 adjacent to v3: yes.

v3 adjacent to u3: yes.

u3 adjacent to u4: in the inner pentagon, u3 is adjacent to u4 and u2, yes.

u4 adjacent to v4: yes.

v4 adjacent to v1: yes, if in the outer pentagon, v4 is adjacent to v5 and v3. Wait, no. Wait, the outer pentagon is v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, with each adjacent to the next. So v4 is adjacent to v3 and v5. So v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, the path v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1 is not a cycle because v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, that&#x27;s a 6-vertex path, but not a cycle.

Hmm. So maybe there&#x27;s no 6-cycle in the Petersen graph. Wait, but according to some references, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5, 6, 8, and 9, but I need to confirm. Let me think. If you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. If you take the inner pentagram, that&#x27;s another 5-cycle. For a 6-cycle, maybe traverse spokes and inner edges. For example: v1, u1, u2, v2, v3, u3, v1. Wait, but that would be v1 connected to u1, u1 connected to u2, u2 connected to v2, v2 connected to v3, v3 connected to u3, u3 connected to v1? Wait, u3 is not connected to v1. So that doesn&#x27;t form a cycle. Alternatively, v1, u1, u5, v5, v4, u4, v1. Let&#x27;s check: v1-u1, u1-u5 (inner edge), u5-v5, v5-v4, v4-u4, u4 connected to v1? No, u4 is connected to v4 and u3. So no. So maybe that&#x27;s not a cycle.

Alternatively, maybe another path. Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1: v1, v2, u2, u3, v3, v4, v1. But v4 is not connected to v1. Hmm. Maybe it&#x27;s not possible. Wait, actually, according to the properties of the Petersen graph, it is a 3-regular graph with girth 5, so the shortest cycle is 5, and it doesn&#x27;t have cycles of length 3 or 4. So perhaps there are cycles of length 6, but they are not induced cycles. Because an induced cycle would require that there are no chords, but in a 6-cycle, if there are chords, it&#x27;s not induced. Given that the Petersen graph is 3-regular, adding chords might complicate things. But since the girth is 5, there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So, a 6-cycle would have to be chordless, which would make it an induced cycle. But does such a cycle exist?

Wait, in the Petersen graph, can we find a 6-cycle? Let me check online in my mind. I recall that the Petersen graph does have cycles of length 6, but they are not induced. Wait, if the girth is 5, then any 6-cycle must have a chord, making it non-induced. Therefore, there are no induced 6-cycles. Therefore, any 6-vertex induced subgraph cannot be a cycle. So, perhaps the induced subgraphs on six vertices in the Petersen graph are not bipartite. But K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph. So, if the induced subgraph is not bipartite, it can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. Alternatively, even if it&#x27;s bipartite, it needs to be complete.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s take a different approach. Let&#x27;s check all possible 6-vertex induced subgraphs of the Petersen graph. Since the Petersen graph is small, maybe this is feasible. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices, so the number of 6-vertex induced subgraphs is C(10,6) = 210. That&#x27;s a lot, but maybe we can reason about their properties.

In an induced subgraph of six vertices, each vertex can have degree at most 3 (since the original graph is 3-regular). For it to be K_{3,3}, each vertex in one partition must have degree 3, connected to all three vertices in the other partition. So in total, each partition has three vertices, and all 9 edges are present between them. But in the induced subgraph, we need to have exactly those edges and no others.

But in the Petersen graph, any two adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Wait, no. Wait, in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. That&#x27;s a key property. Let me confirm. In the Petersen graph, if two vertices are non-adjacent, they have exactly one common neighbor. If they are adjacent, they have no common neighbors. Because it&#x27;s a strongly regular graph with parameters (10,3,0,1), which means each pair of adjacent vertices has 0 common neighbors, and each pair of non-adjacent vertices has 1 common neighbor.

Therefore, in the induced subgraph, if two vertices are adjacent in the Petersen graph, they have no common neighbors in the entire graph, so also in the induced subgraph. If two vertices are non-adjacent in the induced subgraph, they could be adjacent or non-adjacent in the whole graph. But if they are non-adjacent in the whole graph, they have one common neighbor in the whole graph, but that common neighbor might not be in the induced subgraph.

But let&#x27;s consider trying to form K_{3,3}. Suppose we have partitions A and B, each with three vertices. In K_{3,3}, every vertex in A is connected to every vertex in B, and there are no edges within A or within B. So in the induced subgraph, there should be no edges within A or within B, and all edges between A and B.

But in the Petersen graph, edges are arranged such that the outer pentagon and inner pentagram each have their own edges. Let&#x27;s think of the standard drawing. If we pick three vertices from the outer pentagon, they form a path or something. Each is connected to two others in the pentagon. So if we include three outer vertices, they have edges among themselves, which would violate the requirement of K_{3,3} having no edges within a partition. Similarly, three inner vertices would have edges among themselves. Therefore, if we pick three from the outer and three from the inner, the induced subgraph would have edges within the outer three, edges within the inner three, and some edges between them. But K_{3,3} has no edges within partitions. Therefore, such a subgraph would have extra edges, so it wouldn&#x27;t be a K_{3,3}.

Alternatively, maybe pick six vertices not split as three outer and three inner. But the Petersen graph is symmetric, so any six vertices would have a similar structure. Wait, but how else can you partition six vertices? Maybe two from outer, two from inner, and two others? But since the graph is symmetric, perhaps the induced subgraphs would still have edges within their groups.

Alternatively, consider another approach: the complement of the Petersen graph. But maybe that&#x27;s not helpful here.

Wait, another property: K_{3,3} has nine edges. The induced subgraph would need to have nine edges. Let&#x27;s calculate the number of edges in a 6-vertex induced subgraph of the Petersen graph. Each vertex has degree 3, but when you take an induced subgraph, each vertex can have degree between 0 and 3. The total number of edges in the induced subgraph can be calculated by summing the degrees and dividing by 2, but since we&#x27;re dealing with induced subgraphs, it&#x27;s just the number of edges present between those six vertices.

But how many edges can there be? Let&#x27;s see. In the entire Petersen graph, there are 15 edges. If we take six vertices, the maximum number of edges they can have is C(6,2) = 15, but obviously, the induced subgraph will have fewer since the Petersen graph isn&#x27;t complete. Given the regularity and structure, how many edges would a 6-vertex induced subgraph have?

Alternatively, since each vertex has degree 3, in the induced subgraph, each vertex can have at most 3 edges. But since the graph is 3-regular, each vertex has 3 edges in the whole graph. So in the induced subgraph, the degree of a vertex is the number of its neighbors that are also in the subgraph. So the number of edges in the induced subgraph would be half the sum of the degrees of the vertices within the subgraph. Since each vertex can contribute 0 to 3 edges, the total number of edges could be up to (6*3)/2 = 9, which is the number of edges in K_{3,3}. But is there an induced subgraph with 9 edges?

For that, each vertex in the subgraph would need to have degree 3 in the subgraph. But since the original graph is 3-regular, if a vertex has all three neighbors inside the subgraph, then it contributes 3 to the sum. If a vertex has, say, two neighbors inside the subgraph, it contributes 2, etc.

So to have 9 edges, the sum of degrees must be 18, but since each edge is counted twice, 9 edges correspond to sum of degrees 18. Therefore, each of the six vertices must have degree 3 in the induced subgraph, meaning each vertex is connected to all three others in the subgraph. But that would mean the induced subgraph is a 3-regular graph on six vertices. However, the only 3-regular graph on six vertices is the complete bipartite graph K_{3,3}, which is bipartite, and the complete tripartite graph... Wait, no. The 3-regular graphs on six vertices include K_{3,3} and the prism graph (two triangles connected by a matching), also known as the triangular prism, which is a 3-regular graph but not bipartite. So there are two 3-regular graphs on six vertices: K_{3,3} and the prism graph.

Therefore, if the induced subgraph is 3-regular, it could be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But in the Petersen graph, can we find an induced subgraph that&#x27;s 3-regular on six vertices? Let&#x27;s check.

If such a subgraph exists, it would need to be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But given the properties of the Petersen graph, like any two non-adjacent vertices having exactly one common neighbor, let&#x27;s see if a 3-regular induced subgraph is possible.

Suppose we have six vertices forming an induced subgraph. If it&#x27;s K_{3,3}, then it&#x27;s bipartite with partitions A and B. Each vertex in A is connected to all in B, and there are no edges within A or B. But in the Petersen graph, if we take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram, as before, they have edges within their own partitions. So that can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. If we take six vertices in some other configuration, perhaps?

Wait, the prism graph (two triangles connected by edges) is another 3-regular graph on six vertices. Let&#x27;s see if that exists as an induced subgraph in the Petersen graph. The prism graph has two triangles, each triangle being a 3-cycle. But the Petersen graph has girth 5, so it has no 3-cycles. Therefore, the prism graph cannot be a subgraph of the Petersen graph, induced or otherwise. Therefore, the only possible 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices would be K_{3,3}. But since the prism graph is excluded due to the girth, and K_{3,3} would require no edges within each partition, but any three vertices in the Petersen graph would have edges among themselves if they are from the outer or inner cycles.

Therefore, it&#x27;s impossible to have a 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices in the Petersen graph. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph. Thus, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph without induced K_5 or K_{3,3}, making it a counterexample to the original assertion.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample to refute the assertion that &quot;Every graph \( G \) without an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \) subgraph is planar,&quot; we need to check the following:

1. **Planarity of the Petersen Graph**: The Petersen graph is a well-known non-planar graph.
2. **Induced Subgraphs**: We need to verify if the Petersen graph contains an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \).

**Key Points**:
- The Petersen graph is non-planar.
- The Petersen graph is cubic (each vertex has degree 3), so it cannot contain \( K_5 \) as a subgraph (since \( K_5 \) requires each vertex to have degree 4).
- The Petersen graph does not contain \( K_{3,3} \) as an induced subgraph. This is because any induced subgraph of six vertices in the Petersen graph cannot be bipartite with all edges present between the two partitions (as required for \( K_{3,3} \)). The structure of the Petersen graph, with its girth of 5 and the property that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor, prevents the existence of such an induced subgraph.

**Conclusion**:
The Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \). Therefore, it serves as a counterexample to the given assertion.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the Petersen graph can be a counterexample to the statement that &quot;Every graph G without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 subgraph is planar.&quot; Hmm. Let&#x27;s break this down step by step.

First, let me recall some basics. A planar graph is one that can be drawn on the plane without any edges crossing. Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem tells us that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K_5 (the complete graph on five vertices) or K_{3,3} (the complete bipartite graph on six vertices, split into two sets of three). However, the question here is about induced subgraphs, not subdivisions. So the original assertion is saying that if a graph doesn&#x27;t have K_{3,3} or K_5 as an induced subgraph, then it must be planar. If the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have these as induced subgraphs but is itself non-planar, then it would be a counterexample.

Alright, so let me recall the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s a well-known non-planar graph. I remember that it doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but wait, does it contain them as induced subgraphs? That&#x27;s the key here. The original assertion is about induced subgraphs, so even if the Petersen graph had a K_{3,3} or K_5 as a subgraph but not induced, it wouldn&#x27;t matter. The question is specifically about induced ones.

Let me confirm. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges. It&#x27;s a cubic graph (each vertex has degree 3). K_5 has 10 edges and is a complete graph, so each vertex has degree 4. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, it can&#x27;t contain K_5 as a subgraph because you can&#x27;t have a vertex with degree 4 in a cubic graph. Similarly, K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph with each vertex of degree 3. So maybe K_{3,3} could be a subgraph? But again, the question is about induced subgraphs.

An induced subgraph is a subset of the vertices of a graph together with all the edges whose endpoints are both in this subset. So even if the Petersen graph has a subgraph isomorphic to K_{3,3}, unless all the edges present in K_{3,3} between those vertices are also present in the Petersen graph, it&#x27;s not an induced subgraph.

Let me check if the Petersen graph contains an induced K_{3,3}. The Petersen graph is known to be non-planar, but according to Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem, it must contain a subdivision of K_5 or K_{3,3}. Indeed, the Petersen graph is a famous example of a non-planar graph that doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but it does contain a subdivision of K_{3,3}. However, a subdivision is different from an induced subgraph. Subdividing edges adds new vertices on the edges, so a subdivided K_{3,3} would not be an induced subgraph because the original edges are split into paths.

Therefore, the Petersen graph itself is non-planar, but does it contain an induced K_5 or K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s check K_5 first. As mentioned, all vertices in the Petersen graph have degree 3, but in K_5, every vertex has degree 4. So even if you take any 5 vertices in the Petersen graph, they can&#x27;t form a K_5 because the degrees are insufficient. So, there&#x27;s no induced K_5.

What about K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s see. K_{3,3} is bipartite, with two partitions each containing three vertices, and every vertex in one partition connected to every vertex in the other. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex has degree 3. If there was an induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph, each vertex in one partition would need to be connected to all three vertices in the other partition. But since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex can only have three edges. However, in K_{3,3}, each vertex is connected to three vertices in the opposite partition. So, if a vertex in the induced subgraph is part of the K_{3,3}, all its neighbors in the Petersen graph must be within the K_{3,3} as well. But in the Petersen graph, the neighborhoods are structured such that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let me try to visualize the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s usually drawn as a pentagon connected to a pentagram, with each vertex of the pentagon connected to a corresponding vertex of the pentagram. Each vertex is connected to three others: two in its own pentagon/pentagram and one in the other.

Suppose we try to find an induced K_{3,3}. Let&#x27;s take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices and one outer vertex. If we pick three outer vertices and three inner ones, perhaps we can form a bipartition. However, in the Petersen graph, each outer vertex is connected to only one inner vertex, and each inner vertex is connected to only one outer vertex. So, for example, if we take three outer vertices and their corresponding three inner vertices (each connected by a spoke), the edges between the outer and inner vertices would only be the three spokes. But in K_{3,3}, every outer vertex must connect to every inner vertex. In this case, each outer vertex is only connected to one inner vertex, so that&#x27;s only three edges between the partitions, whereas K_{3,3} would require nine edges (3x3). So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Alternatively, maybe if we select different sets of three vertices. Let me think. Since the Petersen graph is symmetric, any selection of six vertices should be similar. Suppose we try to find a bipartite induced subgraph with partitions of size three and three. The problem is that in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let&#x27;s say we pick three vertices from one partition. Each needs to be connected to all three in the other partition. But given the structure of the Petersen graph, each vertex is only connected to three others. If a vertex is in one partition, to connect to all three in the other partition, that would require three edges. But if the other partition has three vertices, each of those would need to connect back to all three in the first partition. However, each vertex in the other partition is already connected to two others in their own partition (if they are on the pentagon or pentagram) and one in the opposite. So they can&#x27;t have three edges to the first partition. Hence, it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph.

Therefore, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as an induced subgraph. Thus, it would serve as a counterexample to the assertion that every graph without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 is planar.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in reasoning about K_{3,3}. Let me try to see if there is a subset of six vertices in the Petersen graph that induce a K_{3,3}. Take the Petersen graph and label the outer pentagon vertices as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 and the inner pentagram vertices as u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, where each ui is connected to vi. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices (in the pentagram) and one outer vertex. So, suppose we take three outer vertices, say v1, v2, v3, and three inner vertices, say u4, u5, u1. Wait, u1 is connected to v1. Let&#x27;s see. The connections between the outer and inner vertices are only the spokes, so v1 is connected to u1, v2 to u2, etc. If we take v1, v2, v3 from the outer and u4, u5, u1 from the inner, then v1 is connected to u1, v2 is connected to u2 (which is not in the set), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set). So, in this subset, the only edges between the outer and inner are v1-u1. The rest of the edges would be the outer edges (v1-v2, v2-v3, v3-v4, etc.), but since we took only v1, v2, v3, the outer edges are v1-v2, v2-v3. The inner vertices u4, u5, u1: in the inner pentagram, u4 is connected to u5 and u3, but u3 isn&#x27;t in the set. u5 is connected to u4 and u1. u1 is connected to u5 and u2 (which isn&#x27;t in the set). So within the inner subset, u4 is connected to u5, u5 is connected to u1, and u1 is connected to no one else in the inner subset. So the induced subgraph on these six vertices would have edges: between outer vertices: v1-v2, v2-v3; between inner vertices: u4-u5, u5-u1; and the spoke edge v1-u1. That&#x27;s nothing like K_{3,3}; it&#x27;s missing almost all the edges.

Alternatively, pick six vertices in some other way. Maybe three from the outer and three from the inner, but not corresponding. For example, take v1, v3, v5 from the outer and u2, u4, u5 from the inner. Let&#x27;s check edges. The outer edges: v1 connected to v2 and v5 (but v2 and v5 are not in the set), so v1 only connected to v5. Wait, no, in the outer pentagon, v1 is connected to v2 and v5. But if we take v1, v3, v5, then v1 is connected to v5 (since they&#x27;re adjacent on the pentagon), v3 is connected to v4 and v2 (neither in the set), and v5 is connected to v1 and v4 (not in the set). So the outer subset has edges v1-v5. The inner subset u2, u4, u5: u2 is connected to u1 and u3 (not in the set), u4 is connected to u3 and u5, u5 is connected to u4 and u1 (not in the set). So u4-u5 is an edge. Between the outer and inner: v1 connected to u1 (not in the inner subset), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set), v5 connected to u5. So only v5-u5 is an edge. So the induced subgraph has edges v1-v5, u4-u5, and v5-u5. That&#x27;s just a triangle? Wait, no. v1 is connected to v5, v5 is connected to u5, and u5 is connected to u4. So it&#x27;s a path of three edges. Not K_{3,3}.

Hmm. Maybe trying different combinations. Alternatively, maybe pick vertices not all from outer and inner. Wait, but the Petersen graph is symmetric, so it shouldn&#x27;t matter. But perhaps if I pick vertices that form a 6-cycle or something. Wait, the Petersen graph has girth 5, so there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So any induced subgraph with a 6-cycle would have to be a hexagon, but the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have a 6-cycle. Wait, actually, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5 and 6? Wait, no, the girth is 5, meaning the shortest cycle is 5. So any cycle of length 6 would have to be a longer cycle. Wait, but can you even get a 6-cycle in the Petersen graph?

Wait, let me check. In the standard Petersen graph, if you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. The inner pentagram is also a 5-cycle. If you traverse the spokes, you can get longer cycles. For example, starting at v1, go to u1, then to u2, then to v2, then to v3, then to u3, then to u4, then to v4, etc. But I think the cycles are either of length 5 or longer. But does it have a 6-cycle? Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1, go to v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, back to v1. Wait, is that a cycle? v1 to v2 (outer edge), v2 to v3 (outer edge), v3 to u3 (spoke), u3 to u4 (inner edge), u4 to v4 (spoke), v4 to v1 (outer edge). That&#x27;s a 6-cycle: v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1. But wait, does this form a cycle? Let&#x27;s check the connections:

v1 adjacent to v2: yes.

v2 adjacent to v3: yes.

v3 adjacent to u3: yes.

u3 adjacent to u4: in the inner pentagon, u3 is adjacent to u4 and u2, yes.

u4 adjacent to v4: yes.

v4 adjacent to v1: yes, if in the outer pentagon, v4 is adjacent to v5 and v3. Wait, no. Wait, the outer pentagon is v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, with each adjacent to the next. So v4 is adjacent to v3 and v5. So v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, the path v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1 is not a cycle because v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, that&#x27;s a 6-vertex path, but not a cycle.

Hmm. So maybe there&#x27;s no 6-cycle in the Petersen graph. Wait, but according to some references, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5, 6, 8, and 9, but I need to confirm. Let me think. If you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. If you take the inner pentagram, that&#x27;s another 5-cycle. For a 6-cycle, maybe traverse spokes and inner edges. For example: v1, u1, u2, v2, v3, u3, v1. Wait, but that would be v1 connected to u1, u1 connected to u2, u2 connected to v2, v2 connected to v3, v3 connected to u3, u3 connected to v1? Wait, u3 is not connected to v1. So that doesn&#x27;t form a cycle. Alternatively, v1, u1, u5, v5, v4, u4, v1. Let&#x27;s check: v1-u1, u1-u5 (inner edge), u5-v5, v5-v4, v4-u4, u4 connected to v1? No, u4 is connected to v4 and u3. So no. So maybe that&#x27;s not a cycle.

Alternatively, maybe another path. Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1: v1, v2, u2, u3, v3, v4, v1. But v4 is not connected to v1. Hmm. Maybe it&#x27;s not possible. Wait, actually, according to the properties of the Petersen graph, it is a 3-regular graph with girth 5, so the shortest cycle is 5, and it doesn&#x27;t have cycles of length 3 or 4. So perhaps there are cycles of length 6, but they are not induced cycles. Because an induced cycle would require that there are no chords, but in a 6-cycle, if there are chords, it&#x27;s not induced. Given that the Petersen graph is 3-regular, adding chords might complicate things. But since the girth is 5, there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So, a 6-cycle would have to be chordless, which would make it an induced cycle. But does such a cycle exist?

Wait, in the Petersen graph, can we find a 6-cycle? Let me check online in my mind. I recall that the Petersen graph does have cycles of length 6, but they are not induced. Wait, if the girth is 5, then any 6-cycle must have a chord, making it non-induced. Therefore, there are no induced 6-cycles. Therefore, any 6-vertex induced subgraph cannot be a cycle. So, perhaps the induced subgraphs on six vertices in the Petersen graph are not bipartite. But K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph. So, if the induced subgraph is not bipartite, it can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. Alternatively, even if it&#x27;s bipartite, it needs to be complete.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s take a different approach. Let&#x27;s check all possible 6-vertex induced subgraphs of the Petersen graph. Since the Petersen graph is small, maybe this is feasible. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices, so the number of 6-vertex induced subgraphs is C(10,6) = 210. That&#x27;s a lot, but maybe we can reason about their properties.

In an induced subgraph of six vertices, each vertex can have degree at most 3 (since the original graph is 3-regular). For it to be K_{3,3}, each vertex in one partition must have degree 3, connected to all three vertices in the other partition. So in total, each partition has three vertices, and all 9 edges are present between them. But in the induced subgraph, we need to have exactly those edges and no others.

But in the Petersen graph, any two adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Wait, no. Wait, in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. That&#x27;s a key property. Let me confirm. In the Petersen graph, if two vertices are non-adjacent, they have exactly one common neighbor. If they are adjacent, they have no common neighbors. Because it&#x27;s a strongly regular graph with parameters (10,3,0,1), which means each pair of adjacent vertices has 0 common neighbors, and each pair of non-adjacent vertices has 1 common neighbor.

Therefore, in the induced subgraph, if two vertices are adjacent in the Petersen graph, they have no common neighbors in the entire graph, so also in the induced subgraph. If two vertices are non-adjacent in the induced subgraph, they could be adjacent or non-adjacent in the whole graph. But if they are non-adjacent in the whole graph, they have one common neighbor in the whole graph, but that common neighbor might not be in the induced subgraph.

But let&#x27;s consider trying to form K_{3,3}. Suppose we have partitions A and B, each with three vertices. In K_{3,3}, every vertex in A is connected to every vertex in B, and there are no edges within A or within B. So in the induced subgraph, there should be no edges within A or within B, and all edges between A and B.

But in the Petersen graph, edges are arranged such that the outer pentagon and inner pentagram each have their own edges. Let&#x27;s think of the standard drawing. If we pick three vertices from the outer pentagon, they form a path or something. Each is connected to two others in the pentagon. So if we include three outer vertices, they have edges among themselves, which would violate the requirement of K_{3,3} having no edges within a partition. Similarly, three inner vertices would have edges among themselves. Therefore, if we pick three from the outer and three from the inner, the induced subgraph would have edges within the outer three, edges within the inner three, and some edges between them. But K_{3,3} has no edges within partitions. Therefore, such a subgraph would have extra edges, so it wouldn&#x27;t be a K_{3,3}.

Alternatively, maybe pick six vertices not split as three outer and three inner. But the Petersen graph is symmetric, so any six vertices would have a similar structure. Wait, but how else can you partition six vertices? Maybe two from outer, two from inner, and two others? But since the graph is symmetric, perhaps the induced subgraphs would still have edges within their groups.

Alternatively, consider another approach: the complement of the Petersen graph. But maybe that&#x27;s not helpful here.

Wait, another property: K_{3,3} has nine edges. The induced subgraph would need to have nine edges. Let&#x27;s calculate the number of edges in a 6-vertex induced subgraph of the Petersen graph. Each vertex has degree 3, but when you take an induced subgraph, each vertex can have degree between 0 and 3. The total number of edges in the induced subgraph can be calculated by summing the degrees and dividing by 2, but since we&#x27;re dealing with induced subgraphs, it&#x27;s just the number of edges present between those six vertices.

But how many edges can there be? Let&#x27;s see. In the entire Petersen graph, there are 15 edges. If we take six vertices, the maximum number of edges they can have is C(6,2) = 15, but obviously, the induced subgraph will have fewer since the Petersen graph isn&#x27;t complete. Given the regularity and structure, how many edges would a 6-vertex induced subgraph have?

Alternatively, since each vertex has degree 3, in the induced subgraph, each vertex can have at most 3 edges. But since the graph is 3-regular, each vertex has 3 edges in the whole graph. So in the induced subgraph, the degree of a vertex is the number of its neighbors that are also in the subgraph. So the number of edges in the induced subgraph would be half the sum of the degrees of the vertices within the subgraph. Since each vertex can contribute 0 to 3 edges, the total number of edges could be up to (6*3)/2 = 9, which is the number of edges in K_{3,3}. But is there an induced subgraph with 9 edges?

For that, each vertex in the subgraph would need to have degree 3 in the subgraph. But since the original graph is 3-regular, if a vertex has all three neighbors inside the subgraph, then it contributes 3 to the sum. If a vertex has, say, two neighbors inside the subgraph, it contributes 2, etc.

So to have 9 edges, the sum of degrees must be 18, but since each edge is counted twice, 9 edges correspond to sum of degrees 18. Therefore, each of the six vertices must have degree 3 in the induced subgraph, meaning each vertex is connected to all three others in the subgraph. But that would mean the induced subgraph is a 3-regular graph on six vertices. However, the only 3-regular graph on six vertices is the complete bipartite graph K_{3,3}, which is bipartite, and the complete tripartite graph... Wait, no. The 3-regular graphs on six vertices include K_{3,3} and the prism graph (two triangles connected by a matching), also known as the triangular prism, which is a 3-regular graph but not bipartite. So there are two 3-regular graphs on six vertices: K_{3,3} and the prism graph.

Therefore, if the induced subgraph is 3-regular, it could be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But in the Petersen graph, can we find an induced subgraph that&#x27;s 3-regular on six vertices? Let&#x27;s check.

If such a subgraph exists, it would need to be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But given the properties of the Petersen graph, like any two non-adjacent vertices having exactly one common neighbor, let&#x27;s see if a 3-regular induced subgraph is possible.

Suppose we have six vertices forming an induced subgraph. If it&#x27;s K_{3,3}, then it&#x27;s bipartite with partitions A and B. Each vertex in A is connected to all in B, and there are no edges within A or B. But in the Petersen graph, if we take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram, as before, they have edges within their own partitions. So that can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. If we take six vertices in some other configuration, perhaps?

Wait, the prism graph (two triangles connected by edges) is another 3-regular graph on six vertices. Let&#x27;s see if that exists as an induced subgraph in the Petersen graph. The prism graph has two triangles, each triangle being a 3-cycle. But the Petersen graph has girth 5, so it has no 3-cycles. Therefore, the prism graph cannot be a subgraph of the Petersen graph, induced or otherwise. Therefore, the only possible 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices would be K_{3,3}. But since the prism graph is excluded due to the girth, and K_{3,3} would require no edges within each partition, but any three vertices in the Petersen graph would have edges among themselves if they are from the outer or inner cycles.

Therefore, it&#x27;s impossible to have a 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices in the Petersen graph. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph. Thus, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph without induced K_5 or K_{3,3}, making it a counterexample to the original assertion.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample to refute the assertion that &quot;Every graph \( G \) without an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \) subgraph is planar,&quot; we need to check the following:

1. **Planarity of the Petersen Graph**: The Petersen graph is a well-known non-planar graph.
2. **Induced Subgraphs**: We need to verify if the Petersen graph contains an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \).

**Key Points**:
- The Petersen graph is non-planar.
- The Petersen graph is cubic (each vertex has degree 3), so it cannot contain \( K_5 \) as a subgraph (since \( K_5 \) requires each vertex to have degree 4).
- The Petersen graph does not contain \( K_{3,3} \) as an induced subgraph. This is because any induced subgraph of six vertices in the Petersen graph cannot be bipartite with all edges present between the two partitions (as required for \( K_{3,3} \)). The structure of the Petersen graph, with its girth of 5 and the property that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor, prevents the existence of such an induced subgraph.

**Conclusion**:
The Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \). Therefore, it serves as a counterexample to the given assertion.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the Petersen graph can be a counterexample to the statement that &quot;Every graph G without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 subgraph is planar.&quot; Hmm. Let&#x27;s break this down step by step.

First, let me recall some basics. A planar graph is one that can be drawn on the plane without any edges crossing. Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem tells us that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K_5 (the complete graph on five vertices) or K_{3,3} (the complete bipartite graph on six vertices, split into two sets of three). However, the question here is about induced subgraphs, not subdivisions. So the original assertion is saying that if a graph doesn&#x27;t have K_{3,3} or K_5 as an induced subgraph, then it must be planar. If the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have these as induced subgraphs but is itself non-planar, then it would be a counterexample.

Alright, so let me recall the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s a well-known non-planar graph. I remember that it doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but wait, does it contain them as induced subgraphs? That&#x27;s the key here. The original assertion is about induced subgraphs, so even if the Petersen graph had a K_{3,3} or K_5 as a subgraph but not induced, it wouldn&#x27;t matter. The question is specifically about induced ones.

Let me confirm. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges. It&#x27;s a cubic graph (each vertex has degree 3). K_5 has 10 edges and is a complete graph, so each vertex has degree 4. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, it can&#x27;t contain K_5 as a subgraph because you can&#x27;t have a vertex with degree 4 in a cubic graph. Similarly, K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph with each vertex of degree 3. So maybe K_{3,3} could be a subgraph? But again, the question is about induced subgraphs.

An induced subgraph is a subset of the vertices of a graph together with all the edges whose endpoints are both in this subset. So even if the Petersen graph has a subgraph isomorphic to K_{3,3}, unless all the edges present in K_{3,3} between those vertices are also present in the Petersen graph, it&#x27;s not an induced subgraph.

Let me check if the Petersen graph contains an induced K_{3,3}. The Petersen graph is known to be non-planar, but according to Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem, it must contain a subdivision of K_5 or K_{3,3}. Indeed, the Petersen graph is a famous example of a non-planar graph that doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but it does contain a subdivision of K_{3,3}. However, a subdivision is different from an induced subgraph. Subdividing edges adds new vertices on the edges, so a subdivided K_{3,3} would not be an induced subgraph because the original edges are split into paths.

Therefore, the Petersen graph itself is non-planar, but does it contain an induced K_5 or K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s check K_5 first. As mentioned, all vertices in the Petersen graph have degree 3, but in K_5, every vertex has degree 4. So even if you take any 5 vertices in the Petersen graph, they can&#x27;t form a K_5 because the degrees are insufficient. So, there&#x27;s no induced K_5.

What about K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s see. K_{3,3} is bipartite, with two partitions each containing three vertices, and every vertex in one partition connected to every vertex in the other. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex has degree 3. If there was an induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph, each vertex in one partition would need to be connected to all three vertices in the other partition. But since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex can only have three edges. However, in K_{3,3}, each vertex is connected to three vertices in the opposite partition. So, if a vertex in the induced subgraph is part of the K_{3,3}, all its neighbors in the Petersen graph must be within the K_{3,3} as well. But in the Petersen graph, the neighborhoods are structured such that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let me try to visualize the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s usually drawn as a pentagon connected to a pentagram, with each vertex of the pentagon connected to a corresponding vertex of the pentagram. Each vertex is connected to three others: two in its own pentagon/pentagram and one in the other.

Suppose we try to find an induced K_{3,3}. Let&#x27;s take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices and one outer vertex. If we pick three outer vertices and three inner ones, perhaps we can form a bipartition. However, in the Petersen graph, each outer vertex is connected to only one inner vertex, and each inner vertex is connected to only one outer vertex. So, for example, if we take three outer vertices and their corresponding three inner vertices (each connected by a spoke), the edges between the outer and inner vertices would only be the three spokes. But in K_{3,3}, every outer vertex must connect to every inner vertex. In this case, each outer vertex is only connected to one inner vertex, so that&#x27;s only three edges between the partitions, whereas K_{3,3} would require nine edges (3x3). So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Alternatively, maybe if we select different sets of three vertices. Let me think. Since the Petersen graph is symmetric, any selection of six vertices should be similar. Suppose we try to find a bipartite induced subgraph with partitions of size three and three. The problem is that in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let&#x27;s say we pick three vertices from one partition. Each needs to be connected to all three in the other partition. But given the structure of the Petersen graph, each vertex is only connected to three others. If a vertex is in one partition, to connect to all three in the other partition, that would require three edges. But if the other partition has three vertices, each of those would need to connect back to all three in the first partition. However, each vertex in the other partition is already connected to two others in their own partition (if they are on the pentagon or pentagram) and one in the opposite. So they can&#x27;t have three edges to the first partition. Hence, it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph.

Therefore, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as an induced subgraph. Thus, it would serve as a counterexample to the assertion that every graph without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 is planar.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in reasoning about K_{3,3}. Let me try to see if there is a subset of six vertices in the Petersen graph that induce a K_{3,3}. Take the Petersen graph and label the outer pentagon vertices as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 and the inner pentagram vertices as u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, where each ui is connected to vi. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices (in the pentagram) and one outer vertex. So, suppose we take three outer vertices, say v1, v2, v3, and three inner vertices, say u4, u5, u1. Wait, u1 is connected to v1. Let&#x27;s see. The connections between the outer and inner vertices are only the spokes, so v1 is connected to u1, v2 to u2, etc. If we take v1, v2, v3 from the outer and u4, u5, u1 from the inner, then v1 is connected to u1, v2 is connected to u2 (which is not in the set), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set). So, in this subset, the only edges between the outer and inner are v1-u1. The rest of the edges would be the outer edges (v1-v2, v2-v3, v3-v4, etc.), but since we took only v1, v2, v3, the outer edges are v1-v2, v2-v3. The inner vertices u4, u5, u1: in the inner pentagram, u4 is connected to u5 and u3, but u3 isn&#x27;t in the set. u5 is connected to u4 and u1. u1 is connected to u5 and u2 (which isn&#x27;t in the set). So within the inner subset, u4 is connected to u5, u5 is connected to u1, and u1 is connected to no one else in the inner subset. So the induced subgraph on these six vertices would have edges: between outer vertices: v1-v2, v2-v3; between inner vertices: u4-u5, u5-u1; and the spoke edge v1-u1. That&#x27;s nothing like K_{3,3}; it&#x27;s missing almost all the edges.

Alternatively, pick six vertices in some other way. Maybe three from the outer and three from the inner, but not corresponding. For example, take v1, v3, v5 from the outer and u2, u4, u5 from the inner. Let&#x27;s check edges. The outer edges: v1 connected to v2 and v5 (but v2 and v5 are not in the set), so v1 only connected to v5. Wait, no, in the outer pentagon, v1 is connected to v2 and v5. But if we take v1, v3, v5, then v1 is connected to v5 (since they&#x27;re adjacent on the pentagon), v3 is connected to v4 and v2 (neither in the set), and v5 is connected to v1 and v4 (not in the set). So the outer subset has edges v1-v5. The inner subset u2, u4, u5: u2 is connected to u1 and u3 (not in the set), u4 is connected to u3 and u5, u5 is connected to u4 and u1 (not in the set). So u4-u5 is an edge. Between the outer and inner: v1 connected to u1 (not in the inner subset), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set), v5 connected to u5. So only v5-u5 is an edge. So the induced subgraph has edges v1-v5, u4-u5, and v5-u5. That&#x27;s just a triangle? Wait, no. v1 is connected to v5, v5 is connected to u5, and u5 is connected to u4. So it&#x27;s a path of three edges. Not K_{3,3}.

Hmm. Maybe trying different combinations. Alternatively, maybe pick vertices not all from outer and inner. Wait, but the Petersen graph is symmetric, so it shouldn&#x27;t matter. But perhaps if I pick vertices that form a 6-cycle or something. Wait, the Petersen graph has girth 5, so there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So any induced subgraph with a 6-cycle would have to be a hexagon, but the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have a 6-cycle. Wait, actually, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5 and 6? Wait, no, the girth is 5, meaning the shortest cycle is 5. So any cycle of length 6 would have to be a longer cycle. Wait, but can you even get a 6-cycle in the Petersen graph?

Wait, let me check. In the standard Petersen graph, if you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. The inner pentagram is also a 5-cycle. If you traverse the spokes, you can get longer cycles. For example, starting at v1, go to u1, then to u2, then to v2, then to v3, then to u3, then to u4, then to v4, etc. But I think the cycles are either of length 5 or longer. But does it have a 6-cycle? Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1, go to v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, back to v1. Wait, is that a cycle? v1 to v2 (outer edge), v2 to v3 (outer edge), v3 to u3 (spoke), u3 to u4 (inner edge), u4 to v4 (spoke), v4 to v1 (outer edge). That&#x27;s a 6-cycle: v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1. But wait, does this form a cycle? Let&#x27;s check the connections:

v1 adjacent to v2: yes.

v2 adjacent to v3: yes.

v3 adjacent to u3: yes.

u3 adjacent to u4: in the inner pentagon, u3 is adjacent to u4 and u2, yes.

u4 adjacent to v4: yes.

v4 adjacent to v1: yes, if in the outer pentagon, v4 is adjacent to v5 and v3. Wait, no. Wait, the outer pentagon is v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, with each adjacent to the next. So v4 is adjacent to v3 and v5. So v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, the path v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1 is not a cycle because v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, that&#x27;s a 6-vertex path, but not a cycle.

Hmm. So maybe there&#x27;s no 6-cycle in the Petersen graph. Wait, but according to some references, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5, 6, 8, and 9, but I need to confirm. Let me think. If you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. If you take the inner pentagram, that&#x27;s another 5-cycle. For a 6-cycle, maybe traverse spokes and inner edges. For example: v1, u1, u2, v2, v3, u3, v1. Wait, but that would be v1 connected to u1, u1 connected to u2, u2 connected to v2, v2 connected to v3, v3 connected to u3, u3 connected to v1? Wait, u3 is not connected to v1. So that doesn&#x27;t form a cycle. Alternatively, v1, u1, u5, v5, v4, u4, v1. Let&#x27;s check: v1-u1, u1-u5 (inner edge), u5-v5, v5-v4, v4-u4, u4 connected to v1? No, u4 is connected to v4 and u3. So no. So maybe that&#x27;s not a cycle.

Alternatively, maybe another path. Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1: v1, v2, u2, u3, v3, v4, v1. But v4 is not connected to v1. Hmm. Maybe it&#x27;s not possible. Wait, actually, according to the properties of the Petersen graph, it is a 3-regular graph with girth 5, so the shortest cycle is 5, and it doesn&#x27;t have cycles of length 3 or 4. So perhaps there are cycles of length 6, but they are not induced cycles. Because an induced cycle would require that there are no chords, but in a 6-cycle, if there are chords, it&#x27;s not induced. Given that the Petersen graph is 3-regular, adding chords might complicate things. But since the girth is 5, there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So, a 6-cycle would have to be chordless, which would make it an induced cycle. But does such a cycle exist?

Wait, in the Petersen graph, can we find a 6-cycle? Let me check online in my mind. I recall that the Petersen graph does have cycles of length 6, but they are not induced. Wait, if the girth is 5, then any 6-cycle must have a chord, making it non-induced. Therefore, there are no induced 6-cycles. Therefore, any 6-vertex induced subgraph cannot be a cycle. So, perhaps the induced subgraphs on six vertices in the Petersen graph are not bipartite. But K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph. So, if the induced subgraph is not bipartite, it can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. Alternatively, even if it&#x27;s bipartite, it needs to be complete.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s take a different approach. Let&#x27;s check all possible 6-vertex induced subgraphs of the Petersen graph. Since the Petersen graph is small, maybe this is feasible. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices, so the number of 6-vertex induced subgraphs is C(10,6) = 210. That&#x27;s a lot, but maybe we can reason about their properties.

In an induced subgraph of six vertices, each vertex can have degree at most 3 (since the original graph is 3-regular). For it to be K_{3,3}, each vertex in one partition must have degree 3, connected to all three vertices in the other partition. So in total, each partition has three vertices, and all 9 edges are present between them. But in the induced subgraph, we need to have exactly those edges and no others.

But in the Petersen graph, any two adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Wait, no. Wait, in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. That&#x27;s a key property. Let me confirm. In the Petersen graph, if two vertices are non-adjacent, they have exactly one common neighbor. If they are adjacent, they have no common neighbors. Because it&#x27;s a strongly regular graph with parameters (10,3,0,1), which means each pair of adjacent vertices has 0 common neighbors, and each pair of non-adjacent vertices has 1 common neighbor.

Therefore, in the induced subgraph, if two vertices are adjacent in the Petersen graph, they have no common neighbors in the entire graph, so also in the induced subgraph. If two vertices are non-adjacent in the induced subgraph, they could be adjacent or non-adjacent in the whole graph. But if they are non-adjacent in the whole graph, they have one common neighbor in the whole graph, but that common neighbor might not be in the induced subgraph.

But let&#x27;s consider trying to form K_{3,3}. Suppose we have partitions A and B, each with three vertices. In K_{3,3}, every vertex in A is connected to every vertex in B, and there are no edges within A or within B. So in the induced subgraph, there should be no edges within A or within B, and all edges between A and B.

But in the Petersen graph, edges are arranged such that the outer pentagon and inner pentagram each have their own edges. Let&#x27;s think of the standard drawing. If we pick three vertices from the outer pentagon, they form a path or something. Each is connected to two others in the pentagon. So if we include three outer vertices, they have edges among themselves, which would violate the requirement of K_{3,3} having no edges within a partition. Similarly, three inner vertices would have edges among themselves. Therefore, if we pick three from the outer and three from the inner, the induced subgraph would have edges within the outer three, edges within the inner three, and some edges between them. But K_{3,3} has no edges within partitions. Therefore, such a subgraph would have extra edges, so it wouldn&#x27;t be a K_{3,3}.

Alternatively, maybe pick six vertices not split as three outer and three inner. But the Petersen graph is symmetric, so any six vertices would have a similar structure. Wait, but how else can you partition six vertices? Maybe two from outer, two from inner, and two others? But since the graph is symmetric, perhaps the induced subgraphs would still have edges within their groups.

Alternatively, consider another approach: the complement of the Petersen graph. But maybe that&#x27;s not helpful here.

Wait, another property: K_{3,3} has nine edges. The induced subgraph would need to have nine edges. Let&#x27;s calculate the number of edges in a 6-vertex induced subgraph of the Petersen graph. Each vertex has degree 3, but when you take an induced subgraph, each vertex can have degree between 0 and 3. The total number of edges in the induced subgraph can be calculated by summing the degrees and dividing by 2, but since we&#x27;re dealing with induced subgraphs, it&#x27;s just the number of edges present between those six vertices.

But how many edges can there be? Let&#x27;s see. In the entire Petersen graph, there are 15 edges. If we take six vertices, the maximum number of edges they can have is C(6,2) = 15, but obviously, the induced subgraph will have fewer since the Petersen graph isn&#x27;t complete. Given the regularity and structure, how many edges would a 6-vertex induced subgraph have?

Alternatively, since each vertex has degree 3, in the induced subgraph, each vertex can have at most 3 edges. But since the graph is 3-regular, each vertex has 3 edges in the whole graph. So in the induced subgraph, the degree of a vertex is the number of its neighbors that are also in the subgraph. So the number of edges in the induced subgraph would be half the sum of the degrees of the vertices within the subgraph. Since each vertex can contribute 0 to 3 edges, the total number of edges could be up to (6*3)/2 = 9, which is the number of edges in K_{3,3}. But is there an induced subgraph with 9 edges?

For that, each vertex in the subgraph would need to have degree 3 in the subgraph. But since the original graph is 3-regular, if a vertex has all three neighbors inside the subgraph, then it contributes 3 to the sum. If a vertex has, say, two neighbors inside the subgraph, it contributes 2, etc.

So to have 9 edges, the sum of degrees must be 18, but since each edge is counted twice, 9 edges correspond to sum of degrees 18. Therefore, each of the six vertices must have degree 3 in the induced subgraph, meaning each vertex is connected to all three others in the subgraph. But that would mean the induced subgraph is a 3-regular graph on six vertices. However, the only 3-regular graph on six vertices is the complete bipartite graph K_{3,3}, which is bipartite, and the complete tripartite graph... Wait, no. The 3-regular graphs on six vertices include K_{3,3} and the prism graph (two triangles connected by a matching), also known as the triangular prism, which is a 3-regular graph but not bipartite. So there are two 3-regular graphs on six vertices: K_{3,3} and the prism graph.

Therefore, if the induced subgraph is 3-regular, it could be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But in the Petersen graph, can we find an induced subgraph that&#x27;s 3-regular on six vertices? Let&#x27;s check.

If such a subgraph exists, it would need to be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But given the properties of the Petersen graph, like any two non-adjacent vertices having exactly one common neighbor, let&#x27;s see if a 3-regular induced subgraph is possible.

Suppose we have six vertices forming an induced subgraph. If it&#x27;s K_{3,3}, then it&#x27;s bipartite with partitions A and B. Each vertex in A is connected to all in B, and there are no edges within A or B. But in the Petersen graph, if we take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram, as before, they have edges within their own partitions. So that can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. If we take six vertices in some other configuration, perhaps?

Wait, the prism graph (two triangles connected by edges) is another 3-regular graph on six vertices. Let&#x27;s see if that exists as an induced subgraph in the Petersen graph. The prism graph has two triangles, each triangle being a 3-cycle. But the Petersen graph has girth 5, so it has no 3-cycles. Therefore, the prism graph cannot be a subgraph of the Petersen graph, induced or otherwise. Therefore, the only possible 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices would be K_{3,3}. But since the prism graph is excluded due to the girth, and K_{3,3} would require no edges within each partition, but any three vertices in the Petersen graph would have edges among themselves if they are from the outer or inner cycles.

Therefore, it&#x27;s impossible to have a 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices in the Petersen graph. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph. Thus, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph without induced K_5 or K_{3,3}, making it a counterexample to the original assertion.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample to refute the assertion that &quot;Every graph \( G \) without an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \) subgraph is planar,&quot; we need to check the following:

1. **Planarity of the Petersen Graph**: The Petersen graph is a well-known non-planar graph.
2. **Induced Subgraphs**: We need to verify if the Petersen graph contains an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \).

**Key Points**:
- The Petersen graph is non-planar.
- The Petersen graph is cubic (each vertex has degree 3), so it cannot contain \( K_5 \) as a subgraph (since \( K_5 \) requires each vertex to have degree 4).
- The Petersen graph does not contain \( K_{3,3} \) as an induced subgraph. This is because any induced subgraph of six vertices in the Petersen graph cannot be bipartite with all edges present between the two partitions (as required for \( K_{3,3} \)). The structure of the Petersen graph, with its girth of 5 and the property that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor, prevents the existence of such an induced subgraph.

**Conclusion**:
The Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \). Therefore, it serves as a counterexample to the given assertion.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out if the Petersen graph can be a counterexample to the statement that &quot;Every graph G without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 subgraph is planar.&quot; Hmm. Let&#x27;s break this down step by step.

First, let me recall some basics. A planar graph is one that can be drawn on the plane without any edges crossing. Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem tells us that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K_5 (the complete graph on five vertices) or K_{3,3} (the complete bipartite graph on six vertices, split into two sets of three). However, the question here is about induced subgraphs, not subdivisions. So the original assertion is saying that if a graph doesn&#x27;t have K_{3,3} or K_5 as an induced subgraph, then it must be planar. If the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have these as induced subgraphs but is itself non-planar, then it would be a counterexample.

Alright, so let me recall the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s a well-known non-planar graph. I remember that it doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but wait, does it contain them as induced subgraphs? That&#x27;s the key here. The original assertion is about induced subgraphs, so even if the Petersen graph had a K_{3,3} or K_5 as a subgraph but not induced, it wouldn&#x27;t matter. The question is specifically about induced ones.

Let me confirm. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges. It&#x27;s a cubic graph (each vertex has degree 3). K_5 has 10 edges and is a complete graph, so each vertex has degree 4. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, it can&#x27;t contain K_5 as a subgraph because you can&#x27;t have a vertex with degree 4 in a cubic graph. Similarly, K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph with each vertex of degree 3. So maybe K_{3,3} could be a subgraph? But again, the question is about induced subgraphs.

An induced subgraph is a subset of the vertices of a graph together with all the edges whose endpoints are both in this subset. So even if the Petersen graph has a subgraph isomorphic to K_{3,3}, unless all the edges present in K_{3,3} between those vertices are also present in the Petersen graph, it&#x27;s not an induced subgraph.

Let me check if the Petersen graph contains an induced K_{3,3}. The Petersen graph is known to be non-planar, but according to Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem, it must contain a subdivision of K_5 or K_{3,3}. Indeed, the Petersen graph is a famous example of a non-planar graph that doesn&#x27;t contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as a subgraph, but it does contain a subdivision of K_{3,3}. However, a subdivision is different from an induced subgraph. Subdividing edges adds new vertices on the edges, so a subdivided K_{3,3} would not be an induced subgraph because the original edges are split into paths.

Therefore, the Petersen graph itself is non-planar, but does it contain an induced K_5 or K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s check K_5 first. As mentioned, all vertices in the Petersen graph have degree 3, but in K_5, every vertex has degree 4. So even if you take any 5 vertices in the Petersen graph, they can&#x27;t form a K_5 because the degrees are insufficient. So, there&#x27;s no induced K_5.

What about K_{3,3}? Let&#x27;s see. K_{3,3} is bipartite, with two partitions each containing three vertices, and every vertex in one partition connected to every vertex in the other. Since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex has degree 3. If there was an induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph, each vertex in one partition would need to be connected to all three vertices in the other partition. But since the Petersen graph is cubic, each vertex can only have three edges. However, in K_{3,3}, each vertex is connected to three vertices in the opposite partition. So, if a vertex in the induced subgraph is part of the K_{3,3}, all its neighbors in the Petersen graph must be within the K_{3,3} as well. But in the Petersen graph, the neighborhoods are structured such that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let me try to visualize the Petersen graph. It&#x27;s usually drawn as a pentagon connected to a pentagram, with each vertex of the pentagon connected to a corresponding vertex of the pentagram. Each vertex is connected to three others: two in its own pentagon/pentagram and one in the other.

Suppose we try to find an induced K_{3,3}. Let&#x27;s take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices and one outer vertex. If we pick three outer vertices and three inner ones, perhaps we can form a bipartition. However, in the Petersen graph, each outer vertex is connected to only one inner vertex, and each inner vertex is connected to only one outer vertex. So, for example, if we take three outer vertices and their corresponding three inner vertices (each connected by a spoke), the edges between the outer and inner vertices would only be the three spokes. But in K_{3,3}, every outer vertex must connect to every inner vertex. In this case, each outer vertex is only connected to one inner vertex, so that&#x27;s only three edges between the partitions, whereas K_{3,3} would require nine edges (3x3). So that doesn&#x27;t work.

Alternatively, maybe if we select different sets of three vertices. Let me think. Since the Petersen graph is symmetric, any selection of six vertices should be similar. Suppose we try to find a bipartite induced subgraph with partitions of size three and three. The problem is that in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Let&#x27;s say we pick three vertices from one partition. Each needs to be connected to all three in the other partition. But given the structure of the Petersen graph, each vertex is only connected to three others. If a vertex is in one partition, to connect to all three in the other partition, that would require three edges. But if the other partition has three vertices, each of those would need to connect back to all three in the first partition. However, each vertex in the other partition is already connected to two others in their own partition (if they are on the pentagon or pentagram) and one in the opposite. So they can&#x27;t have three edges to the first partition. Hence, it&#x27;s impossible. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph.

Therefore, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain K_5 or K_{3,3} as an induced subgraph. Thus, it would serve as a counterexample to the assertion that every graph without an induced K_{3,3} or K_5 is planar.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in reasoning about K_{3,3}. Let me try to see if there is a subset of six vertices in the Petersen graph that induce a K_{3,3}. Take the Petersen graph and label the outer pentagon vertices as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 and the inner pentagram vertices as u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, where each ui is connected to vi. Each outer vertex is connected to two adjacent outer vertices and one inner vertex. Each inner vertex is connected to two adjacent inner vertices (in the pentagram) and one outer vertex. So, suppose we take three outer vertices, say v1, v2, v3, and three inner vertices, say u4, u5, u1. Wait, u1 is connected to v1. Let&#x27;s see. The connections between the outer and inner vertices are only the spokes, so v1 is connected to u1, v2 to u2, etc. If we take v1, v2, v3 from the outer and u4, u5, u1 from the inner, then v1 is connected to u1, v2 is connected to u2 (which is not in the set), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set). So, in this subset, the only edges between the outer and inner are v1-u1. The rest of the edges would be the outer edges (v1-v2, v2-v3, v3-v4, etc.), but since we took only v1, v2, v3, the outer edges are v1-v2, v2-v3. The inner vertices u4, u5, u1: in the inner pentagram, u4 is connected to u5 and u3, but u3 isn&#x27;t in the set. u5 is connected to u4 and u1. u1 is connected to u5 and u2 (which isn&#x27;t in the set). So within the inner subset, u4 is connected to u5, u5 is connected to u1, and u1 is connected to no one else in the inner subset. So the induced subgraph on these six vertices would have edges: between outer vertices: v1-v2, v2-v3; between inner vertices: u4-u5, u5-u1; and the spoke edge v1-u1. That&#x27;s nothing like K_{3,3}; it&#x27;s missing almost all the edges.

Alternatively, pick six vertices in some other way. Maybe three from the outer and three from the inner, but not corresponding. For example, take v1, v3, v5 from the outer and u2, u4, u5 from the inner. Let&#x27;s check edges. The outer edges: v1 connected to v2 and v5 (but v2 and v5 are not in the set), so v1 only connected to v5. Wait, no, in the outer pentagon, v1 is connected to v2 and v5. But if we take v1, v3, v5, then v1 is connected to v5 (since they&#x27;re adjacent on the pentagon), v3 is connected to v4 and v2 (neither in the set), and v5 is connected to v1 and v4 (not in the set). So the outer subset has edges v1-v5. The inner subset u2, u4, u5: u2 is connected to u1 and u3 (not in the set), u4 is connected to u3 and u5, u5 is connected to u4 and u1 (not in the set). So u4-u5 is an edge. Between the outer and inner: v1 connected to u1 (not in the inner subset), v3 connected to u3 (not in the set), v5 connected to u5. So only v5-u5 is an edge. So the induced subgraph has edges v1-v5, u4-u5, and v5-u5. That&#x27;s just a triangle? Wait, no. v1 is connected to v5, v5 is connected to u5, and u5 is connected to u4. So it&#x27;s a path of three edges. Not K_{3,3}.

Hmm. Maybe trying different combinations. Alternatively, maybe pick vertices not all from outer and inner. Wait, but the Petersen graph is symmetric, so it shouldn&#x27;t matter. But perhaps if I pick vertices that form a 6-cycle or something. Wait, the Petersen graph has girth 5, so there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So any induced subgraph with a 6-cycle would have to be a hexagon, but the Petersen graph doesn&#x27;t have a 6-cycle. Wait, actually, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5 and 6? Wait, no, the girth is 5, meaning the shortest cycle is 5. So any cycle of length 6 would have to be a longer cycle. Wait, but can you even get a 6-cycle in the Petersen graph?

Wait, let me check. In the standard Petersen graph, if you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. The inner pentagram is also a 5-cycle. If you traverse the spokes, you can get longer cycles. For example, starting at v1, go to u1, then to u2, then to v2, then to v3, then to u3, then to u4, then to v4, etc. But I think the cycles are either of length 5 or longer. But does it have a 6-cycle? Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1, go to v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, back to v1. Wait, is that a cycle? v1 to v2 (outer edge), v2 to v3 (outer edge), v3 to u3 (spoke), u3 to u4 (inner edge), u4 to v4 (spoke), v4 to v1 (outer edge). That&#x27;s a 6-cycle: v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1. But wait, does this form a cycle? Let&#x27;s check the connections:

v1 adjacent to v2: yes.

v2 adjacent to v3: yes.

v3 adjacent to u3: yes.

u3 adjacent to u4: in the inner pentagon, u3 is adjacent to u4 and u2, yes.

u4 adjacent to v4: yes.

v4 adjacent to v1: yes, if in the outer pentagon, v4 is adjacent to v5 and v3. Wait, no. Wait, the outer pentagon is v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, with each adjacent to the next. So v4 is adjacent to v3 and v5. So v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, the path v1, v2, v3, u3, u4, v4, v1 is not a cycle because v4 is not adjacent to v1. Therefore, that&#x27;s a 6-vertex path, but not a cycle.

Hmm. So maybe there&#x27;s no 6-cycle in the Petersen graph. Wait, but according to some references, the Petersen graph has cycles of length 5, 6, 8, and 9, but I need to confirm. Let me think. If you take the outer pentagon, that&#x27;s a 5-cycle. If you take the inner pentagram, that&#x27;s another 5-cycle. For a 6-cycle, maybe traverse spokes and inner edges. For example: v1, u1, u2, v2, v3, u3, v1. Wait, but that would be v1 connected to u1, u1 connected to u2, u2 connected to v2, v2 connected to v3, v3 connected to u3, u3 connected to v1? Wait, u3 is not connected to v1. So that doesn&#x27;t form a cycle. Alternatively, v1, u1, u5, v5, v4, u4, v1. Let&#x27;s check: v1-u1, u1-u5 (inner edge), u5-v5, v5-v4, v4-u4, u4 connected to v1? No, u4 is connected to v4 and u3. So no. So maybe that&#x27;s not a cycle.

Alternatively, maybe another path. Let&#x27;s see. Starting at v1: v1, v2, u2, u3, v3, v4, v1. But v4 is not connected to v1. Hmm. Maybe it&#x27;s not possible. Wait, actually, according to the properties of the Petersen graph, it is a 3-regular graph with girth 5, so the shortest cycle is 5, and it doesn&#x27;t have cycles of length 3 or 4. So perhaps there are cycles of length 6, but they are not induced cycles. Because an induced cycle would require that there are no chords, but in a 6-cycle, if there are chords, it&#x27;s not induced. Given that the Petersen graph is 3-regular, adding chords might complicate things. But since the girth is 5, there are no 3-cycles or 4-cycles. So, a 6-cycle would have to be chordless, which would make it an induced cycle. But does such a cycle exist?

Wait, in the Petersen graph, can we find a 6-cycle? Let me check online in my mind. I recall that the Petersen graph does have cycles of length 6, but they are not induced. Wait, if the girth is 5, then any 6-cycle must have a chord, making it non-induced. Therefore, there are no induced 6-cycles. Therefore, any 6-vertex induced subgraph cannot be a cycle. So, perhaps the induced subgraphs on six vertices in the Petersen graph are not bipartite. But K_{3,3} is a bipartite graph. So, if the induced subgraph is not bipartite, it can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. Alternatively, even if it&#x27;s bipartite, it needs to be complete.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s take a different approach. Let&#x27;s check all possible 6-vertex induced subgraphs of the Petersen graph. Since the Petersen graph is small, maybe this is feasible. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices, so the number of 6-vertex induced subgraphs is C(10,6) = 210. That&#x27;s a lot, but maybe we can reason about their properties.

In an induced subgraph of six vertices, each vertex can have degree at most 3 (since the original graph is 3-regular). For it to be K_{3,3}, each vertex in one partition must have degree 3, connected to all three vertices in the other partition. So in total, each partition has three vertices, and all 9 edges are present between them. But in the induced subgraph, we need to have exactly those edges and no others.

But in the Petersen graph, any two adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. Wait, no. Wait, in the Petersen graph, any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor. That&#x27;s a key property. Let me confirm. In the Petersen graph, if two vertices are non-adjacent, they have exactly one common neighbor. If they are adjacent, they have no common neighbors. Because it&#x27;s a strongly regular graph with parameters (10,3,0,1), which means each pair of adjacent vertices has 0 common neighbors, and each pair of non-adjacent vertices has 1 common neighbor.

Therefore, in the induced subgraph, if two vertices are adjacent in the Petersen graph, they have no common neighbors in the entire graph, so also in the induced subgraph. If two vertices are non-adjacent in the induced subgraph, they could be adjacent or non-adjacent in the whole graph. But if they are non-adjacent in the whole graph, they have one common neighbor in the whole graph, but that common neighbor might not be in the induced subgraph.

But let&#x27;s consider trying to form K_{3,3}. Suppose we have partitions A and B, each with three vertices. In K_{3,3}, every vertex in A is connected to every vertex in B, and there are no edges within A or within B. So in the induced subgraph, there should be no edges within A or within B, and all edges between A and B.

But in the Petersen graph, edges are arranged such that the outer pentagon and inner pentagram each have their own edges. Let&#x27;s think of the standard drawing. If we pick three vertices from the outer pentagon, they form a path or something. Each is connected to two others in the pentagon. So if we include three outer vertices, they have edges among themselves, which would violate the requirement of K_{3,3} having no edges within a partition. Similarly, three inner vertices would have edges among themselves. Therefore, if we pick three from the outer and three from the inner, the induced subgraph would have edges within the outer three, edges within the inner three, and some edges between them. But K_{3,3} has no edges within partitions. Therefore, such a subgraph would have extra edges, so it wouldn&#x27;t be a K_{3,3}.

Alternatively, maybe pick six vertices not split as three outer and three inner. But the Petersen graph is symmetric, so any six vertices would have a similar structure. Wait, but how else can you partition six vertices? Maybe two from outer, two from inner, and two others? But since the graph is symmetric, perhaps the induced subgraphs would still have edges within their groups.

Alternatively, consider another approach: the complement of the Petersen graph. But maybe that&#x27;s not helpful here.

Wait, another property: K_{3,3} has nine edges. The induced subgraph would need to have nine edges. Let&#x27;s calculate the number of edges in a 6-vertex induced subgraph of the Petersen graph. Each vertex has degree 3, but when you take an induced subgraph, each vertex can have degree between 0 and 3. The total number of edges in the induced subgraph can be calculated by summing the degrees and dividing by 2, but since we&#x27;re dealing with induced subgraphs, it&#x27;s just the number of edges present between those six vertices.

But how many edges can there be? Let&#x27;s see. In the entire Petersen graph, there are 15 edges. If we take six vertices, the maximum number of edges they can have is C(6,2) = 15, but obviously, the induced subgraph will have fewer since the Petersen graph isn&#x27;t complete. Given the regularity and structure, how many edges would a 6-vertex induced subgraph have?

Alternatively, since each vertex has degree 3, in the induced subgraph, each vertex can have at most 3 edges. But since the graph is 3-regular, each vertex has 3 edges in the whole graph. So in the induced subgraph, the degree of a vertex is the number of its neighbors that are also in the subgraph. So the number of edges in the induced subgraph would be half the sum of the degrees of the vertices within the subgraph. Since each vertex can contribute 0 to 3 edges, the total number of edges could be up to (6*3)/2 = 9, which is the number of edges in K_{3,3}. But is there an induced subgraph with 9 edges?

For that, each vertex in the subgraph would need to have degree 3 in the subgraph. But since the original graph is 3-regular, if a vertex has all three neighbors inside the subgraph, then it contributes 3 to the sum. If a vertex has, say, two neighbors inside the subgraph, it contributes 2, etc.

So to have 9 edges, the sum of degrees must be 18, but since each edge is counted twice, 9 edges correspond to sum of degrees 18. Therefore, each of the six vertices must have degree 3 in the induced subgraph, meaning each vertex is connected to all three others in the subgraph. But that would mean the induced subgraph is a 3-regular graph on six vertices. However, the only 3-regular graph on six vertices is the complete bipartite graph K_{3,3}, which is bipartite, and the complete tripartite graph... Wait, no. The 3-regular graphs on six vertices include K_{3,3} and the prism graph (two triangles connected by a matching), also known as the triangular prism, which is a 3-regular graph but not bipartite. So there are two 3-regular graphs on six vertices: K_{3,3} and the prism graph.

Therefore, if the induced subgraph is 3-regular, it could be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But in the Petersen graph, can we find an induced subgraph that&#x27;s 3-regular on six vertices? Let&#x27;s check.

If such a subgraph exists, it would need to be either K_{3,3} or the prism graph. But given the properties of the Petersen graph, like any two non-adjacent vertices having exactly one common neighbor, let&#x27;s see if a 3-regular induced subgraph is possible.

Suppose we have six vertices forming an induced subgraph. If it&#x27;s K_{3,3}, then it&#x27;s bipartite with partitions A and B. Each vertex in A is connected to all in B, and there are no edges within A or B. But in the Petersen graph, if we take three vertices from the outer pentagon and three from the inner pentagram, as before, they have edges within their own partitions. So that can&#x27;t be K_{3,3}. If we take six vertices in some other configuration, perhaps?

Wait, the prism graph (two triangles connected by edges) is another 3-regular graph on six vertices. Let&#x27;s see if that exists as an induced subgraph in the Petersen graph. The prism graph has two triangles, each triangle being a 3-cycle. But the Petersen graph has girth 5, so it has no 3-cycles. Therefore, the prism graph cannot be a subgraph of the Petersen graph, induced or otherwise. Therefore, the only possible 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices would be K_{3,3}. But since the prism graph is excluded due to the girth, and K_{3,3} would require no edges within each partition, but any three vertices in the Petersen graph would have edges among themselves if they are from the outer or inner cycles.

Therefore, it&#x27;s impossible to have a 3-regular induced subgraph on six vertices in the Petersen graph. Therefore, there is no induced K_{3,3} in the Petersen graph. Thus, the Petersen graph is a non-planar graph without induced K_5 or K_{3,3}, making it a counterexample to the original assertion.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine if the Petersen graph can be used as a counterexample to refute the assertion that &quot;Every graph \( G \) without an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \) subgraph is planar,&quot; we need to check the following:

1. **Planarity of the Petersen Graph**: The Petersen graph is a well-known non-planar graph.
2. **Induced Subgraphs**: We need to verify if the Petersen graph contains an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \).

**Key Points**:
- The Petersen graph is non-planar.
- The Petersen graph is cubic (each vertex has degree 3), so it cannot contain \( K_5 \) as a subgraph (since \( K_5 \) requires each vertex to have degree 4).
- The Petersen graph does not contain \( K_{3,3} \) as an induced subgraph. This is because any induced subgraph of six vertices in the Petersen graph cannot be bipartite with all edges present between the two partitions (as required for \( K_{3,3} \)). The structure of the Petersen graph, with its girth of 5 and the property that any two non-adjacent vertices have exactly one common neighbor, prevents the existence of such an induced subgraph.

**Conclusion**:
The Petersen graph is a non-planar graph that does not contain an induced \( K_{3,3} \) or \( K_5 \). Therefore, it serves as a counterexample to the given assertion.

Problem: Fifty ping-pong-balls are numbered 1, 2, 3, ..., 49, 50. A ball is chosen at random. What is the probability that the number on the selected ball is a multiple of 5 or 7 or both? Express your answer as a common fraction. Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Response: \boxed{1}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: There are 10 balls whose number is divisible by 5. The balls $7, 14, \ldots,49$ are multiples of 7.  There are 7 of these.  The ball 35 is the unique ball that is a multiple of both 5 and 7.

In total, there are $10+7-1 = 16$ balls whose number is divisible by 5 or 7.  The probability that a randomly selected ball will be one of these 16 is $\frac{16}{50} = \boxed{\frac{8}{25}}$.          </p>

Reference Answer: The semi-circle with diameter BC has radius $\frac{1}{2}$ that of the semi-circle with diameter AB, and thus, has $\frac{1}{4}$ of the area.  (Area of a circle $= \pi \times r^2$ - thus, if $r$ is half as large, that will be squared in the process).  Therefore, the sum of their areas represents $\frac{5}{8}$ of a circle with diameter AB, and since the line CP splits this area exactly in half, that area would be $\frac{5}{16}$ of a circle with diameter AB.  Therefore, the degree measure of that sector is $360 \times \frac{5}{16} = \boxed{112.5}$          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: The semi-circle with diameter BC has radius $\frac{1}{2}$ that of the semi-circle with diameter AB, and thus, has $\frac{1}{4}$ of the area.  (Area of a circle $= \pi \times r^2$ - thus, if $r$ is half as large, that will be squared in the process).  Therefore, the sum of their areas represents $\frac{5}{8}$ of a circle with diameter AB, and since the line CP splits this area exactly in half, that area would be $\frac{5}{16}$ of a circle with diameter AB.  Therefore, the degree measure of that sector is $360 \times \frac{5}{16} = \boxed{112.5}$          </p>

Therefore, the sum of their areas represents $\frac{5}{8}$ of a circle with diameter AB, and since the line CP splits this area exactly in half, that area would be $\frac{5}{16}$ of a circle with diameter AB.  Therefore, the degree measure of that sector is $360 \times \frac{5}{16} = \boxed{112.5}$          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limit as x approaches 0 of x cubed multiplied by the sum of squares from 1 up to [1/|x|], where [.] is the greatest integer function. Hmm, let me start by understanding what this sum looks like.

First, when x approaches 0, 1/|x| becomes very large. So, [1/|x|] is the integer part of 1/|x|. Let&#x27;s denote n = [1/|x|]. Then, the sum in question is 1² + 2² + 3² + ... + n². I remember there&#x27;s a formula for the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers. Let me recall it. I think it&#x27;s n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Let me verify that. For example, if n=1, sum is 1, formula gives 1*2*3/6=6/6=1. If n=2, sum is 1+4=5, formula gives 2*3*5/6=30/6=5. Yeah, that seems right. So the sum is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6.

So substituting back, the expression becomes x³ * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6], where n = [1/|x|]. Since x is approaching 0, n is a large integer. So maybe I can approximate n as approximately 1/|x|, since [1/|x|] is the integer part, but as x approaches 0, the difference between 1/|x| and [1/|x|] becomes negligible. Is that right? Let&#x27;s see. For example, if x is approaching 0 from the positive side, then |x| = x, and [1/x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 1/x. So 1/x - 1 &lt; [1/x] ≤ 1/x. Therefore, as x approaches 0, 1/x becomes very large, and [1/x] ≈ 1/x with an error of less than 1. So maybe we can replace n with 1/|x| in the formula, but we need to be careful with the error terms.

So substituting n ≈ 1/|x|, then the sum becomes approximately (1/|x|)(1/|x| + 1)(2*(1/|x|) + 1)/6. Let me write this out:

Sum ≈ (1/|x|) * (1/|x| + 1) * (2/|x| + 1)/6

Multiply these terms out:

First, multiply (1/|x| + 1) and (2/|x| + 1):

(1/|x|)(2/|x|) + (1/|x|)(1) + 1*(2/|x|) + 1*1

= 2/|x|² + 1/|x| + 2/|x| + 1

= 2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1

Then multiply by (1/|x|)/6:

(1/|x|)/6 * (2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1) = (2/|x|³ + 3/|x|² + 1/|x|)/6

So the sum is approximately (2/(6|x|³) + 3/(6|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)) = (1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|))

Now, the original expression is x³ times this sum:

x³ * [1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)]

Since x is approaching 0, let&#x27;s consider x approaching 0 from the positive side first, so |x| = x. Then, we can write:

x³ * [1/(3x³) + 1/(2x²) + 1/(6x)] = x³*(1/(3x³)) + x³*(1/(2x²)) + x³*(1/(6x))

Simplify each term:

First term: x³/(3x³) = 1/3

Second term: x³/(2x²) = x/2

Third term: x³/(6x) = x²/6

As x approaches 0, the second and third terms approach 0, so the entire expression approaches 1/3.

But wait, is this correct? Because we approximated n as 1/x, but actually n = [1/x], which is 1/x minus a fractional part less than 1. So n = 1/x - {1/x}, where {1/x} is the fractional part. Therefore, n = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. So when we plug n into the sum formula, maybe we need to consider the effect of δ?

Hmm, let&#x27;s analyze that. Let me write n = [1/x] = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. Then, the sum is:

Sum = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 = (1/x - δ)(1/x - δ + 1)(2(1/x - δ) + 1)/6

This looks complicated. Let&#x27;s expand this expression step by step.

First, compute each bracket:

First term: (1/x - δ)

Second term: (1/x - δ + 1) = (1/x + 1 - δ)

Third term: 2(1/x - δ) + 1 = 2/x - 2δ + 1

Multiply all three terms:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ)(2/x + 1 - 2δ)

This seems messy, but maybe we can expand this in terms of 1/x. Since δ is between 0 and 1, and x is approaching 0, 1/x is large, so terms with higher powers of 1/x will dominate.

Let me expand the first two factors first:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ) = (1/x)(1/x + 1 - δ) - δ(1/x + 1 - δ)

= (1/x² + (1 - δ)/x) - (δ/x + δ(1 - δ))

= 1/x² + (1 - δ)/x - δ/x - δ(1 - δ)

Simplify:

1/x² + [ (1 - δ) - δ ] /x - δ(1 - δ)

= 1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²

Now multiply this by the third factor (2/x + 1 - 2δ):

[1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²] * [2/x + 1 - 2δ]

Let&#x27;s multiply term by term:

First term: 1/x² * 2/x = 2/x³

Second term: 1/x² * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)/x²

Third term: (1 - 2δ)/x * 2/x = 2(1 - 2δ)/x²

Fourth term: (1 - 2δ)/x * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)^2 /x

Fifth term: (-δ + δ²) * 2/x = (-2δ + 2δ²)/x

Sixth term: (-δ + δ²) * (1 - 2δ) = -δ(1 - 2δ) + δ²(1 - 2δ) = -δ + 2δ² + δ² - 2δ³ = -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So combining all terms:

2/x³ + (1 - 2δ)/x² + 2(1 - 2δ)/x² + (1 - 2δ)^2 /x + (-2δ + 2δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Combine like terms:

For 1/x³: 2/x³

For 1/x²: [ (1 - 2δ) + 2(1 - 2δ) ] /x² = [1 - 2δ + 2 - 4δ]/x² = (3 - 6δ)/x²

For 1/x: [ (1 - 2δ)^2 + (-2δ + 2δ²) ] /x

Let me compute (1 - 2δ)^2:

= 1 - 4δ + 4δ²

So adding (-2δ + 2δ²):

1 - 4δ + 4δ² -2δ + 2δ² = 1 - 6δ + 6δ²

Therefore, the 1/x term is (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x

Constant term: -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So overall, the product is:

2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Therefore, the sum is:

[2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)] /6

So when we multiply this by x³, the original expression becomes:

x³ * Sum ≈ x³ * [2/(6x³) + (3 - 6δ)/(6x²) + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6]

Simplify each term:

First term: x³*(2)/(6x³) = 2/6 = 1/3

Second term: x³*(3 - 6δ)/(6x²) = (3 - 6δ)x/(6) = (1 - 2δ)x/2

Third term: x³*(1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) = (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)x²/6

Fourth term: x³*(-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6 = (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)x³/6

Now, as x approaches 0, δ is between 0 and 1. So δ is bounded. Therefore, the second term is O(x), the third term is O(x²), and the fourth term is O(x³). All of these go to 0 as x approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is determined by the first term, which is 1/3. So the limit is 1/3?

But wait, but δ is dependent on x. Since δ = 1/x - n, where n is [1/x], so δ = {1/x}, the fractional part of 1/x. So as x approaches 0, 1/x can be written as integer plus fractional part. So δ is between 0 and 1. However, as x approaches 0, depending on the sequence of x&#x27;s approaching 0, δ can oscillate between 0 and 1. For example, if x approaches 0 through 1/n for integer n, then δ = 0. If x approaches 0 through 1/(n + 0.5), then δ = 0.5. So δ can vary. However, in our calculation above, the only term that could possibly depend on δ is the second term (1 - 2δ)x/2, but even though δ varies between 0 and 1, as x approaches 0, (1 - 2δ) is bounded (since δ is between 0 and1, 1 - 2δ is between -1 and1), so (1 - 2δ)x/2 approaches 0 as x approaches 0 regardless of δ. Similarly, the other terms also vanish. Therefore, regardless of the value of δ, the limit is 1/3. So maybe the answer is 1/3.

But let me check with specific sequences. Suppose x approaches 0 through the sequence x_n = 1/n, where n is a positive integer. Then [1/x] = [n] = n. Then the sum is 1² + 2² + ... + n² = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Multiply by x³ = (1/n³):

So expression is (1/n³) * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6] = [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n³) = [(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n²)

Expand numerator: (n + 1)(2n +1) = 2n² + 3n +1

Therefore, expression is (2n² + 3n +1)/(6n²) = (2 + 3/n + 1/n²)/6

As n approaches infinity, this approaches (2 + 0 +0)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3. So that&#x27;s consistent.

Now, take another sequence where x approaches 0 through x = 1/(n + 0.5), where n is integer. Then [1/x] = [n + 0.5] = n. So sum is still up to n, same as before. Then x = 1/(n + 0.5), so x³ = 1/(n + 0.5)^3, and the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + 0.5)^3.

Let me compute this as n approaches infinity. Let&#x27;s write n + 0.5 as n(1 + 0.5/n). Then denominator is (n(1 + 0.5/n))³ = n³(1 + 0.5/n)^3 ≈ n³(1 + 1.5/n + ...) by binomial expansion.

Numerator: n(n +1)(2n +1) ≈ n*(n)(2n) = 2n³. So numerator ≈2n³, denominator≈6n³. Therefore, expression ≈2n³/(6n³) = 1/3. The higher order terms would be lower order in n, so as n approaches infinity, the expression still approaches 1/3. So regardless of how x approaches 0, the limit seems to be 1/3.

But let me test with x approaching 0 through some irrational sequence. For example, x = 1/(n + sqrt(2)), but here [1/x] would still be n, as 1/x = n + sqrt(2), so [1/x] = n. So similar to the previous case, the sum would be up to n, and x³ = 1/(n + sqrt(2))³. Then the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + sqrt(2))³. As n approaches infinity, the same reasoning applies: numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so limit 1/3.

Therefore, seems like regardless of the approach path, the limit is 1/3.

But let me check with another example where x approaches 0 in a different way, say x = 1/(n + ε), where ε is a fixed between 0 and1. For instance, ε=0.1. Then [1/x] = n, sum is up to n, x³ =1/(n +0.1)^3. Then expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n +0.1)^3. Again, as n→∞, numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so expression ~1/3.

Alternatively, take x approaching 0 through x=1/(n - 0.1). Then [1/x] = [n -0.1] = n -1. Wait, but 1/x =n -0.1, so [1/x] = n -1. Then sum is up to n -1. So expression is [(n -1)n(2n -1)/6]/(n -0.1)^3. Let&#x27;s compute this:

Numerator: (n -1)n(2n -1) ≈ (n² -n)(2n -1) ≈2n³ -n² -2n² +n ≈2n³ -3n² +n ~2n³

Denominator:6(n -0.1)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.1/n)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.3/n + ...) ~6n³

Thus, the expression ~2n³/(6n³)=1/3. So still converges to 1/3.

Therefore, regardless of how x approaches 0, as long as we take the limit, the expression tends to 1/3.

But wait, in the initial approximation, we neglected the δ term, assuming that n ≈1/x. But even when we considered δ, the correction terms ended up vanishing in the limit. Therefore, the limit is indeed 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use integral approximation for the sum. The sum from k=1 to n of k² is approximately the integral from 0 to n of t² dt, which is n³/3. But the sum is actually larger than the integral. The integral from 0 to n of t² dt = n³/3, and the sum from k=1 to n of k² is ~n³/3 + n²/2 + n/6. So the leading term is n³/3. So when we multiply by x³, and since n = [1/x] ≈1/x, the leading term is (1/x)³/3 *x³ =1/3, which matches our previous result. The next term would be n²/2 ~ (1/x²)/2 *x³ =x/2, which tends to 0. So this also suggests that the limit is 1/3.

Therefore, multiple approaches confirm that the limit is 1/3.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the limit \(\lim \limits_{x \to 0} \ x^3\Big(1+2^2+3^2+\ldots+\Big[\frac{1}{\vert x \vert}\Big]^2\Big)\), we start by noting that as \(x \to 0\), \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) becomes very large. Let \(n = \left[\frac{1}{|x|}\right]\), which is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{|x|}\). The sum of squares from 1 to \(n\) is given by the formula:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\]

Substituting \(n \approx \frac{1}{|x|}\) (since \(n\) is the integer part of \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) and the difference becomes negligible as \(x \to 0\)), we approximate the sum:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right)\left(\frac{1}{|x|} + 1\right)\left(2\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right) + 1\right)}{6}
\]

Expanding and simplifying the terms, we get:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{1}{|x|^3} \cdot \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|^2} \cdot \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|} \cdot \frac{1}{6}
\]

Multiplying this sum by \(x^3\) and considering the leading terms as \(x \to 0\):

\[
x^3 \left( \frac{2}{6|x|^3} + \frac{3}{6|x|^2} + \frac{1}{6|x|} \right) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{6}
\]

As \(x \to 0\), the terms \(\frac{x}{2}\) and \(\frac{x^2}{6}\) approach 0, leaving the limit as:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limit as x approaches 0 of x cubed multiplied by the sum of squares from 1 up to [1/|x|], where [.] is the greatest integer function. Hmm, let me start by understanding what this sum looks like.

First, when x approaches 0, 1/|x| becomes very large. So, [1/|x|] is the integer part of 1/|x|. Let&#x27;s denote n = [1/|x|]. Then, the sum in question is 1² + 2² + 3² + ... + n². I remember there&#x27;s a formula for the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers. Let me recall it. I think it&#x27;s n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Let me verify that. For example, if n=1, sum is 1, formula gives 1*2*3/6=6/6=1. If n=2, sum is 1+4=5, formula gives 2*3*5/6=30/6=5. Yeah, that seems right. So the sum is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6.

So substituting back, the expression becomes x³ * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6], where n = [1/|x|]. Since x is approaching 0, n is a large integer. So maybe I can approximate n as approximately 1/|x|, since [1/|x|] is the integer part, but as x approaches 0, the difference between 1/|x| and [1/|x|] becomes negligible. Is that right? Let&#x27;s see. For example, if x is approaching 0 from the positive side, then |x| = x, and [1/x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 1/x. So 1/x - 1 &lt; [1/x] ≤ 1/x. Therefore, as x approaches 0, 1/x becomes very large, and [1/x] ≈ 1/x with an error of less than 1. So maybe we can replace n with 1/|x| in the formula, but we need to be careful with the error terms.

So substituting n ≈ 1/|x|, then the sum becomes approximately (1/|x|)(1/|x| + 1)(2*(1/|x|) + 1)/6. Let me write this out:

Sum ≈ (1/|x|) * (1/|x| + 1) * (2/|x| + 1)/6

Multiply these terms out:

First, multiply (1/|x| + 1) and (2/|x| + 1):

(1/|x|)(2/|x|) + (1/|x|)(1) + 1*(2/|x|) + 1*1

= 2/|x|² + 1/|x| + 2/|x| + 1

= 2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1

Then multiply by (1/|x|)/6:

(1/|x|)/6 * (2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1) = (2/|x|³ + 3/|x|² + 1/|x|)/6

So the sum is approximately (2/(6|x|³) + 3/(6|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)) = (1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|))

Now, the original expression is x³ times this sum:

x³ * [1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)]

Since x is approaching 0, let&#x27;s consider x approaching 0 from the positive side first, so |x| = x. Then, we can write:

x³ * [1/(3x³) + 1/(2x²) + 1/(6x)] = x³*(1/(3x³)) + x³*(1/(2x²)) + x³*(1/(6x))

Simplify each term:

First term: x³/(3x³) = 1/3

Second term: x³/(2x²) = x/2

Third term: x³/(6x) = x²/6

As x approaches 0, the second and third terms approach 0, so the entire expression approaches 1/3.

But wait, is this correct? Because we approximated n as 1/x, but actually n = [1/x], which is 1/x minus a fractional part less than 1. So n = 1/x - {1/x}, where {1/x} is the fractional part. Therefore, n = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. So when we plug n into the sum formula, maybe we need to consider the effect of δ?

Hmm, let&#x27;s analyze that. Let me write n = [1/x] = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. Then, the sum is:

Sum = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 = (1/x - δ)(1/x - δ + 1)(2(1/x - δ) + 1)/6

This looks complicated. Let&#x27;s expand this expression step by step.

First, compute each bracket:

First term: (1/x - δ)

Second term: (1/x - δ + 1) = (1/x + 1 - δ)

Third term: 2(1/x - δ) + 1 = 2/x - 2δ + 1

Multiply all three terms:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ)(2/x + 1 - 2δ)

This seems messy, but maybe we can expand this in terms of 1/x. Since δ is between 0 and 1, and x is approaching 0, 1/x is large, so terms with higher powers of 1/x will dominate.

Let me expand the first two factors first:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ) = (1/x)(1/x + 1 - δ) - δ(1/x + 1 - δ)

= (1/x² + (1 - δ)/x) - (δ/x + δ(1 - δ))

= 1/x² + (1 - δ)/x - δ/x - δ(1 - δ)

Simplify:

1/x² + [ (1 - δ) - δ ] /x - δ(1 - δ)

= 1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²

Now multiply this by the third factor (2/x + 1 - 2δ):

[1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²] * [2/x + 1 - 2δ]

Let&#x27;s multiply term by term:

First term: 1/x² * 2/x = 2/x³

Second term: 1/x² * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)/x²

Third term: (1 - 2δ)/x * 2/x = 2(1 - 2δ)/x²

Fourth term: (1 - 2δ)/x * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)^2 /x

Fifth term: (-δ + δ²) * 2/x = (-2δ + 2δ²)/x

Sixth term: (-δ + δ²) * (1 - 2δ) = -δ(1 - 2δ) + δ²(1 - 2δ) = -δ + 2δ² + δ² - 2δ³ = -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So combining all terms:

2/x³ + (1 - 2δ)/x² + 2(1 - 2δ)/x² + (1 - 2δ)^2 /x + (-2δ + 2δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Combine like terms:

For 1/x³: 2/x³

For 1/x²: [ (1 - 2δ) + 2(1 - 2δ) ] /x² = [1 - 2δ + 2 - 4δ]/x² = (3 - 6δ)/x²

For 1/x: [ (1 - 2δ)^2 + (-2δ + 2δ²) ] /x

Let me compute (1 - 2δ)^2:

= 1 - 4δ + 4δ²

So adding (-2δ + 2δ²):

1 - 4δ + 4δ² -2δ + 2δ² = 1 - 6δ + 6δ²

Therefore, the 1/x term is (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x

Constant term: -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So overall, the product is:

2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Therefore, the sum is:

[2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)] /6

So when we multiply this by x³, the original expression becomes:

x³ * Sum ≈ x³ * [2/(6x³) + (3 - 6δ)/(6x²) + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6]

Simplify each term:

First term: x³*(2)/(6x³) = 2/6 = 1/3

Second term: x³*(3 - 6δ)/(6x²) = (3 - 6δ)x/(6) = (1 - 2δ)x/2

Third term: x³*(1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) = (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)x²/6

Fourth term: x³*(-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6 = (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)x³/6

Now, as x approaches 0, δ is between 0 and 1. So δ is bounded. Therefore, the second term is O(x), the third term is O(x²), and the fourth term is O(x³). All of these go to 0 as x approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is determined by the first term, which is 1/3. So the limit is 1/3?

But wait, but δ is dependent on x. Since δ = 1/x - n, where n is [1/x], so δ = {1/x}, the fractional part of 1/x. So as x approaches 0, 1/x can be written as integer plus fractional part. So δ is between 0 and 1. However, as x approaches 0, depending on the sequence of x&#x27;s approaching 0, δ can oscillate between 0 and 1. For example, if x approaches 0 through 1/n for integer n, then δ = 0. If x approaches 0 through 1/(n + 0.5), then δ = 0.5. So δ can vary. However, in our calculation above, the only term that could possibly depend on δ is the second term (1 - 2δ)x/2, but even though δ varies between 0 and 1, as x approaches 0, (1 - 2δ) is bounded (since δ is between 0 and1, 1 - 2δ is between -1 and1), so (1 - 2δ)x/2 approaches 0 as x approaches 0 regardless of δ. Similarly, the other terms also vanish. Therefore, regardless of the value of δ, the limit is 1/3. So maybe the answer is 1/3.

But let me check with specific sequences. Suppose x approaches 0 through the sequence x_n = 1/n, where n is a positive integer. Then [1/x] = [n] = n. Then the sum is 1² + 2² + ... + n² = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Multiply by x³ = (1/n³):

So expression is (1/n³) * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6] = [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n³) = [(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n²)

Expand numerator: (n + 1)(2n +1) = 2n² + 3n +1

Therefore, expression is (2n² + 3n +1)/(6n²) = (2 + 3/n + 1/n²)/6

As n approaches infinity, this approaches (2 + 0 +0)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3. So that&#x27;s consistent.

Now, take another sequence where x approaches 0 through x = 1/(n + 0.5), where n is integer. Then [1/x] = [n + 0.5] = n. So sum is still up to n, same as before. Then x = 1/(n + 0.5), so x³ = 1/(n + 0.5)^3, and the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + 0.5)^3.

Let me compute this as n approaches infinity. Let&#x27;s write n + 0.5 as n(1 + 0.5/n). Then denominator is (n(1 + 0.5/n))³ = n³(1 + 0.5/n)^3 ≈ n³(1 + 1.5/n + ...) by binomial expansion.

Numerator: n(n +1)(2n +1) ≈ n*(n)(2n) = 2n³. So numerator ≈2n³, denominator≈6n³. Therefore, expression ≈2n³/(6n³) = 1/3. The higher order terms would be lower order in n, so as n approaches infinity, the expression still approaches 1/3. So regardless of how x approaches 0, the limit seems to be 1/3.

But let me test with x approaching 0 through some irrational sequence. For example, x = 1/(n + sqrt(2)), but here [1/x] would still be n, as 1/x = n + sqrt(2), so [1/x] = n. So similar to the previous case, the sum would be up to n, and x³ = 1/(n + sqrt(2))³. Then the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + sqrt(2))³. As n approaches infinity, the same reasoning applies: numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so limit 1/3.

Therefore, seems like regardless of the approach path, the limit is 1/3.

But let me check with another example where x approaches 0 in a different way, say x = 1/(n + ε), where ε is a fixed between 0 and1. For instance, ε=0.1. Then [1/x] = n, sum is up to n, x³ =1/(n +0.1)^3. Then expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n +0.1)^3. Again, as n→∞, numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so expression ~1/3.

Alternatively, take x approaching 0 through x=1/(n - 0.1). Then [1/x] = [n -0.1] = n -1. Wait, but 1/x =n -0.1, so [1/x] = n -1. Then sum is up to n -1. So expression is [(n -1)n(2n -1)/6]/(n -0.1)^3. Let&#x27;s compute this:

Numerator: (n -1)n(2n -1) ≈ (n² -n)(2n -1) ≈2n³ -n² -2n² +n ≈2n³ -3n² +n ~2n³

Denominator:6(n -0.1)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.1/n)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.3/n + ...) ~6n³

Thus, the expression ~2n³/(6n³)=1/3. So still converges to 1/3.

Therefore, regardless of how x approaches 0, as long as we take the limit, the expression tends to 1/3.

But wait, in the initial approximation, we neglected the δ term, assuming that n ≈1/x. But even when we considered δ, the correction terms ended up vanishing in the limit. Therefore, the limit is indeed 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use integral approximation for the sum. The sum from k=1 to n of k² is approximately the integral from 0 to n of t² dt, which is n³/3. But the sum is actually larger than the integral. The integral from 0 to n of t² dt = n³/3, and the sum from k=1 to n of k² is ~n³/3 + n²/2 + n/6. So the leading term is n³/3. So when we multiply by x³, and since n = [1/x] ≈1/x, the leading term is (1/x)³/3 *x³ =1/3, which matches our previous result. The next term would be n²/2 ~ (1/x²)/2 *x³ =x/2, which tends to 0. So this also suggests that the limit is 1/3.

Therefore, multiple approaches confirm that the limit is 1/3.

To find the limit \(\lim \limits_{x \to 0} \ x^3\Big(1+2^2+3^2+\ldots+\Big[\frac{1}{\vert x \vert}\Big]^2\Big)\), we start by noting that as \(x \to 0\), \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) becomes very large. Let \(n = \left[\frac{1}{|x|}\right]\), which is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{|x|}\). The sum of squares from 1 to \(n\) is given by the formula:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\]

Substituting \(n \approx \frac{1}{|x|}\) (since \(n\) is the integer part of \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) and the difference becomes negligible as \(x \to 0\)), we approximate the sum:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right)\left(\frac{1}{|x|} + 1\right)\left(2\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right) + 1\right)}{6}
\]

Expanding and simplifying the terms, we get:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{1}{|x|^3} \cdot \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|^2} \cdot \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|} \cdot \frac{1}{6}
\]

Multiplying this sum by \(x^3\) and considering the leading terms as \(x \to 0\):

\[
x^3 \left( \frac{2}{6|x|^3} + \frac{3}{6|x|^2} + \frac{1}{6|x|} \right) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{6}
\]

As \(x \to 0\), the terms \(\frac{x}{2}\) and \(\frac{x^2}{6}\) approach 0, leaving the limit as:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limit as x approaches 0 of x cubed multiplied by the sum of squares from 1 up to [1/|x|], where [.] is the greatest integer function. Hmm, let me start by understanding what this sum looks like.

First, when x approaches 0, 1/|x| becomes very large. So, [1/|x|] is the integer part of 1/|x|. Let&#x27;s denote n = [1/|x|]. Then, the sum in question is 1² + 2² + 3² + ... + n². I remember there&#x27;s a formula for the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers. Let me recall it. I think it&#x27;s n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Let me verify that. For example, if n=1, sum is 1, formula gives 1*2*3/6=6/6=1. If n=2, sum is 1+4=5, formula gives 2*3*5/6=30/6=5. Yeah, that seems right. So the sum is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6.

So substituting back, the expression becomes x³ * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6], where n = [1/|x|]. Since x is approaching 0, n is a large integer. So maybe I can approximate n as approximately 1/|x|, since [1/|x|] is the integer part, but as x approaches 0, the difference between 1/|x| and [1/|x|] becomes negligible. Is that right? Let&#x27;s see. For example, if x is approaching 0 from the positive side, then |x| = x, and [1/x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 1/x. So 1/x - 1 &lt; [1/x] ≤ 1/x. Therefore, as x approaches 0, 1/x becomes very large, and [1/x] ≈ 1/x with an error of less than 1. So maybe we can replace n with 1/|x| in the formula, but we need to be careful with the error terms.

So substituting n ≈ 1/|x|, then the sum becomes approximately (1/|x|)(1/|x| + 1)(2*(1/|x|) + 1)/6. Let me write this out:

Sum ≈ (1/|x|) * (1/|x| + 1) * (2/|x| + 1)/6

Multiply these terms out:

First, multiply (1/|x| + 1) and (2/|x| + 1):

(1/|x|)(2/|x|) + (1/|x|)(1) + 1*(2/|x|) + 1*1

= 2/|x|² + 1/|x| + 2/|x| + 1

= 2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1

Then multiply by (1/|x|)/6:

(1/|x|)/6 * (2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1) = (2/|x|³ + 3/|x|² + 1/|x|)/6

So the sum is approximately (2/(6|x|³) + 3/(6|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)) = (1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|))

Now, the original expression is x³ times this sum:

x³ * [1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)]

Since x is approaching 0, let&#x27;s consider x approaching 0 from the positive side first, so |x| = x. Then, we can write:

x³ * [1/(3x³) + 1/(2x²) + 1/(6x)] = x³*(1/(3x³)) + x³*(1/(2x²)) + x³*(1/(6x))

Simplify each term:

First term: x³/(3x³) = 1/3

Second term: x³/(2x²) = x/2

Third term: x³/(6x) = x²/6

As x approaches 0, the second and third terms approach 0, so the entire expression approaches 1/3.

But wait, is this correct? Because we approximated n as 1/x, but actually n = [1/x], which is 1/x minus a fractional part less than 1. So n = 1/x - {1/x}, where {1/x} is the fractional part. Therefore, n = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. So when we plug n into the sum formula, maybe we need to consider the effect of δ?

Hmm, let&#x27;s analyze that. Let me write n = [1/x] = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. Then, the sum is:

Sum = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 = (1/x - δ)(1/x - δ + 1)(2(1/x - δ) + 1)/6

This looks complicated. Let&#x27;s expand this expression step by step.

First, compute each bracket:

First term: (1/x - δ)

Second term: (1/x - δ + 1) = (1/x + 1 - δ)

Third term: 2(1/x - δ) + 1 = 2/x - 2δ + 1

Multiply all three terms:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ)(2/x + 1 - 2δ)

This seems messy, but maybe we can expand this in terms of 1/x. Since δ is between 0 and 1, and x is approaching 0, 1/x is large, so terms with higher powers of 1/x will dominate.

Let me expand the first two factors first:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ) = (1/x)(1/x + 1 - δ) - δ(1/x + 1 - δ)

= (1/x² + (1 - δ)/x) - (δ/x + δ(1 - δ))

= 1/x² + (1 - δ)/x - δ/x - δ(1 - δ)

Simplify:

1/x² + [ (1 - δ) - δ ] /x - δ(1 - δ)

= 1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²

Now multiply this by the third factor (2/x + 1 - 2δ):

[1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²] * [2/x + 1 - 2δ]

Let&#x27;s multiply term by term:

First term: 1/x² * 2/x = 2/x³

Second term: 1/x² * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)/x²

Third term: (1 - 2δ)/x * 2/x = 2(1 - 2δ)/x²

Fourth term: (1 - 2δ)/x * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)^2 /x

Fifth term: (-δ + δ²) * 2/x = (-2δ + 2δ²)/x

Sixth term: (-δ + δ²) * (1 - 2δ) = -δ(1 - 2δ) + δ²(1 - 2δ) = -δ + 2δ² + δ² - 2δ³ = -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So combining all terms:

2/x³ + (1 - 2δ)/x² + 2(1 - 2δ)/x² + (1 - 2δ)^2 /x + (-2δ + 2δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Combine like terms:

For 1/x³: 2/x³

For 1/x²: [ (1 - 2δ) + 2(1 - 2δ) ] /x² = [1 - 2δ + 2 - 4δ]/x² = (3 - 6δ)/x²

For 1/x: [ (1 - 2δ)^2 + (-2δ + 2δ²) ] /x

Let me compute (1 - 2δ)^2:

= 1 - 4δ + 4δ²

So adding (-2δ + 2δ²):

1 - 4δ + 4δ² -2δ + 2δ² = 1 - 6δ + 6δ²

Therefore, the 1/x term is (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x

Constant term: -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So overall, the product is:

2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Therefore, the sum is:

[2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)] /6

So when we multiply this by x³, the original expression becomes:

x³ * Sum ≈ x³ * [2/(6x³) + (3 - 6δ)/(6x²) + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6]

Simplify each term:

First term: x³*(2)/(6x³) = 2/6 = 1/3

Second term: x³*(3 - 6δ)/(6x²) = (3 - 6δ)x/(6) = (1 - 2δ)x/2

Third term: x³*(1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) = (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)x²/6

Fourth term: x³*(-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6 = (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)x³/6

Now, as x approaches 0, δ is between 0 and 1. So δ is bounded. Therefore, the second term is O(x), the third term is O(x²), and the fourth term is O(x³). All of these go to 0 as x approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is determined by the first term, which is 1/3. So the limit is 1/3?

But wait, but δ is dependent on x. Since δ = 1/x - n, where n is [1/x], so δ = {1/x}, the fractional part of 1/x. So as x approaches 0, 1/x can be written as integer plus fractional part. So δ is between 0 and 1. However, as x approaches 0, depending on the sequence of x&#x27;s approaching 0, δ can oscillate between 0 and 1. For example, if x approaches 0 through 1/n for integer n, then δ = 0. If x approaches 0 through 1/(n + 0.5), then δ = 0.5. So δ can vary. However, in our calculation above, the only term that could possibly depend on δ is the second term (1 - 2δ)x/2, but even though δ varies between 0 and 1, as x approaches 0, (1 - 2δ) is bounded (since δ is between 0 and1, 1 - 2δ is between -1 and1), so (1 - 2δ)x/2 approaches 0 as x approaches 0 regardless of δ. Similarly, the other terms also vanish. Therefore, regardless of the value of δ, the limit is 1/3. So maybe the answer is 1/3.

But let me check with specific sequences. Suppose x approaches 0 through the sequence x_n = 1/n, where n is a positive integer. Then [1/x] = [n] = n. Then the sum is 1² + 2² + ... + n² = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Multiply by x³ = (1/n³):

So expression is (1/n³) * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6] = [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n³) = [(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n²)

Expand numerator: (n + 1)(2n +1) = 2n² + 3n +1

Therefore, expression is (2n² + 3n +1)/(6n²) = (2 + 3/n + 1/n²)/6

As n approaches infinity, this approaches (2 + 0 +0)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3. So that&#x27;s consistent.

Now, take another sequence where x approaches 0 through x = 1/(n + 0.5), where n is integer. Then [1/x] = [n + 0.5] = n. So sum is still up to n, same as before. Then x = 1/(n + 0.5), so x³ = 1/(n + 0.5)^3, and the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + 0.5)^3.

Let me compute this as n approaches infinity. Let&#x27;s write n + 0.5 as n(1 + 0.5/n). Then denominator is (n(1 + 0.5/n))³ = n³(1 + 0.5/n)^3 ≈ n³(1 + 1.5/n + ...) by binomial expansion.

Numerator: n(n +1)(2n +1) ≈ n*(n)(2n) = 2n³. So numerator ≈2n³, denominator≈6n³. Therefore, expression ≈2n³/(6n³) = 1/3. The higher order terms would be lower order in n, so as n approaches infinity, the expression still approaches 1/3. So regardless of how x approaches 0, the limit seems to be 1/3.

But let me test with x approaching 0 through some irrational sequence. For example, x = 1/(n + sqrt(2)), but here [1/x] would still be n, as 1/x = n + sqrt(2), so [1/x] = n. So similar to the previous case, the sum would be up to n, and x³ = 1/(n + sqrt(2))³. Then the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + sqrt(2))³. As n approaches infinity, the same reasoning applies: numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so limit 1/3.

Therefore, seems like regardless of the approach path, the limit is 1/3.

But let me check with another example where x approaches 0 in a different way, say x = 1/(n + ε), where ε is a fixed between 0 and1. For instance, ε=0.1. Then [1/x] = n, sum is up to n, x³ =1/(n +0.1)^3. Then expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n +0.1)^3. Again, as n→∞, numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so expression ~1/3.

Alternatively, take x approaching 0 through x=1/(n - 0.1). Then [1/x] = [n -0.1] = n -1. Wait, but 1/x =n -0.1, so [1/x] = n -1. Then sum is up to n -1. So expression is [(n -1)n(2n -1)/6]/(n -0.1)^3. Let&#x27;s compute this:

Numerator: (n -1)n(2n -1) ≈ (n² -n)(2n -1) ≈2n³ -n² -2n² +n ≈2n³ -3n² +n ~2n³

Denominator:6(n -0.1)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.1/n)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.3/n + ...) ~6n³

Thus, the expression ~2n³/(6n³)=1/3. So still converges to 1/3.

Therefore, regardless of how x approaches 0, as long as we take the limit, the expression tends to 1/3.

But wait, in the initial approximation, we neglected the δ term, assuming that n ≈1/x. But even when we considered δ, the correction terms ended up vanishing in the limit. Therefore, the limit is indeed 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use integral approximation for the sum. The sum from k=1 to n of k² is approximately the integral from 0 to n of t² dt, which is n³/3. But the sum is actually larger than the integral. The integral from 0 to n of t² dt = n³/3, and the sum from k=1 to n of k² is ~n³/3 + n²/2 + n/6. So the leading term is n³/3. So when we multiply by x³, and since n = [1/x] ≈1/x, the leading term is (1/x)³/3 *x³ =1/3, which matches our previous result. The next term would be n²/2 ~ (1/x²)/2 *x³ =x/2, which tends to 0. So this also suggests that the limit is 1/3.

Therefore, multiple approaches confirm that the limit is 1/3.

\]

Substituting \(n \approx \frac{1}{|x|}\) (since \(n\) is the integer part of \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) and the difference becomes negligible as \(x \to 0\)), we approximate the sum:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right)\left(\frac{1}{|x|} + 1\right)\left(2\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right) + 1\right)}{6}
\]

Expanding and simplifying the terms, we get:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{1}{|x|^3} \cdot \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|^2} \cdot \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|} \cdot \frac{1}{6}
\]

Multiplying this sum by \(x^3\) and considering the leading terms as \(x \to 0\):

\[
x^3 \left( \frac{2}{6|x|^3} + \frac{3}{6|x|^2} + \frac{1}{6|x|} \right) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{6}
\]

As \(x \to 0\), the terms \(\frac{x}{2}\) and \(\frac{x^2}{6}\) approach 0, leaving the limit as:

For example, if n=1, sum is 1, formula gives 1*2*3/6=6/6=1. If n=2, sum is 1+4=5, formula gives 2*3*5/6=30/6=5. Yeah, that seems right. So the sum is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6.

So substituting back, the expression becomes x³ * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6], where n = [1/|x|]. Since x is approaching 0, n is a large integer. So maybe I can approximate n as approximately 1/|x|, since [1/|x|] is the integer part, but as x approaches 0, the difference between 1/|x| and [1/|x|] becomes negligible. Is that right? Let&#x27;s see. For example, if x is approaching 0 from the positive side, then |x| = x, and [1/x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 1/x. So 1/x - 1 &lt; [1/x] ≤ 1/x.

So maybe we can replace n with 1/|x| in the formula, but we need to be careful with the error terms.

So substituting n ≈ 1/|x|, then the sum becomes approximately (1/|x|)(1/|x| + 1)(2*(1/|x|) + 1)/6. Let me write this out:

Sum ≈ (1/|x|) * (1/|x| + 1) * (2/|x| + 1)/6

Multiply these terms out:

First, multiply (1/|x| + 1) and (2/|x| + 1):

(1/|x|)(2/|x|) + (1/|x|)(1) + 1*(2/|x|) + 1*1

= 2/|x|² + 1/|x| + 2/|x| + 1

= 2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1

Then multiply by (1/|x|)/6:

(1/|x|)/6 * (2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1) = (2/|x|³ + 3/|x|² + 1/|x|)/6

So the sum is approximately (2/(6|x|³) + 3/(6|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)) = (1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|))

Now, the original expression is x³ times this sum:

x³ * [1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)]

Since x is approaching 0, let&#x27;s consider x approaching 0 from the positive side first, so |x| = x. Then, we can write:

x³ * [1/(3x³) + 1/(2x²) + 1/(6x)] = x³*(1/(3x³)) + x³*(1/(2x²)) + x³*(1/(6x))

Simplify each term:

First term: x³/(3x³) = 1/3

Second term: x³/(2x²) = x/2

Third term: x³/(6x) = x²/6

Sum = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 = (1/x - δ)(1/x - δ + 1)(2(1/x - δ) + 1)/6

This looks complicated. Let&#x27;s expand this expression step by step.

First, compute each bracket:

First term: (1/x - δ)

Second term: (1/x - δ + 1) = (1/x + 1 - δ)

Third term: 2(1/x - δ) + 1 = 2/x - 2δ + 1

Multiply all three terms:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ)(2/x + 1 - 2δ)

This seems messy, but maybe we can expand this in terms of 1/x. Since δ is between 0 and 1, and x is approaching 0, 1/x is large, so terms with higher powers of 1/x will dominate.

Let me expand the first two factors first:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ) = (1/x)(1/x + 1 - δ) - δ(1/x + 1 - δ)

= (1/x² + (1 - δ)/x) - (δ/x + δ(1 - δ))

= 1/x² + (1 - δ)/x - δ/x - δ(1 - δ)

Simplify:

1/x² + [ (1 - δ) - δ ] /x - δ(1 - δ)

= 1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²

Now multiply this by the third factor (2/x + 1 - 2δ):

[1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²] * [2/x + 1 - 2δ]

Let&#x27;s multiply term by term:

First term: 1/x² * 2/x = 2/x³

Second term: 1/x² * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)/x²

Third term: (1 - 2δ)/x * 2/x = 2(1 - 2δ)/x²

Fourth term: (1 - 2δ)/x * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)^2 /x

Fifth term: (-δ + δ²) * 2/x = (-2δ + 2δ²)/x

Sixth term: (-δ + δ²) * (1 - 2δ) = -δ(1 - 2δ) + δ²(1 - 2δ) = -δ + 2δ² + δ² - 2δ³ = -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So combining all terms:

2/x³ + (1 - 2δ)/x² + 2(1 - 2δ)/x² + (1 - 2δ)^2 /x + (-2δ + 2δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Combine like terms:

For 1/x³: 2/x³

For 1/x²: [ (1 - 2δ) + 2(1 - 2δ) ] /x² = [1 - 2δ + 2 - 4δ]/x² = (3 - 6δ)/x²

For 1/x: [ (1 - 2δ)^2 + (-2δ + 2δ²) ] /x

Let me compute (1 - 2δ)^2:

= 1 - 4δ + 4δ²

So adding (-2δ + 2δ²):

1 - 4δ + 4δ² -2δ + 2δ² = 1 - 6δ + 6δ²

Therefore, the 1/x term is (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x

Constant term: -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So overall, the product is:

2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Therefore, the sum is:

[2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)] /6

So when we multiply this by x³, the original expression becomes:

x³ * Sum ≈ x³ * [2/(6x³) + (3 - 6δ)/(6x²) + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6]

Simplify each term:

First term: x³*(2)/(6x³) = 2/6 = 1/3

Second term: x³*(3 - 6δ)/(6x²) = (3 - 6δ)x/(6) = (1 - 2δ)x/2

Third term: x³*(1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) = (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)x²/6

Fourth term: x³*(-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6 = (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)x³/6

Now, as x approaches 0, δ is between 0 and 1. So δ is bounded. Therefore, the second term is O(x), the third term is O(x²), and the fourth term is O(x³). All of these go to 0 as x approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is determined by the first term, which is 1/3. So the limit is 1/3?

But wait, but δ is dependent on x. Since δ = 1/x - n, where n is [1/x], so δ = {1/x}, the fractional part of 1/x. So as x approaches 0, 1/x can be written as integer plus fractional part. So δ is between 0 and 1. However, as x approaches 0, depending on the sequence of x&#x27;s approaching 0, δ can oscillate between 0 and 1. For example, if x approaches 0 through 1/n for integer n, then δ = 0. If x approaches 0 through 1/(n + 0.5), then δ = 0.5. So δ can vary. However, in our calculation above, the only term that could possibly depend on δ is the second term (1 - 2δ)x/2, but even though δ varies between 0 and 1, as x approaches 0, (1 - 2δ) is bounded (since δ is between 0 and1, 1 - 2δ is between -1 and1), so (1 - 2δ)x/2 approaches 0 as x approaches 0 regardless of δ. Similarly, the other terms also vanish. Therefore, regardless of the value of δ, the limit is 1/3. So maybe the answer is 1/3.

But let me check with specific sequences. Suppose x approaches 0 through the sequence x_n = 1/n, where n is a positive integer. Then [1/x] = [n] = n. Then the sum is 1² + 2² + ... + n² = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Multiply by x³ = (1/n³):

So expression is (1/n³) * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6] = [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n³) = [(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n²)

Expand numerator: (n + 1)(2n +1) = 2n² + 3n +1

Therefore, expression is (2n² + 3n +1)/(6n²) = (2 + 3/n + 1/n²)/6

As n approaches infinity, this approaches (2 + 0 +0)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3. So that&#x27;s consistent.

Now, take another sequence where x approaches 0 through x = 1/(n + 0.5), where n is integer. Then [1/x] = [n + 0.5] = n. So sum is still up to n, same as before. Then x = 1/(n + 0.5), so x³ = 1/(n + 0.5)^3, and the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + 0.5)^3.

Let me compute this as n approaches infinity. Let&#x27;s write n + 0.5 as n(1 + 0.5/n). Then denominator is (n(1 + 0.5/n))³ = n³(1 + 0.5/n)^3 ≈ n³(1 + 1.5/n + ...) by binomial expansion.

Numerator: n(n +1)(2n +1) ≈ n*(n)(2n) = 2n³. So numerator ≈2n³, denominator≈6n³. Therefore, expression ≈2n³/(6n³) = 1/3. The higher order terms would be lower order in n, so as n approaches infinity, the expression still approaches 1/3. So regardless of how x approaches 0, the limit seems to be 1/3.

But let me test with x approaching 0 through some irrational sequence. For example, x = 1/(n + sqrt(2)), but here [1/x] would still be n, as 1/x = n + sqrt(2), so [1/x] = n. So similar to the previous case, the sum would be up to n, and x³ = 1/(n + sqrt(2))³. Then the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + sqrt(2))³. As n approaches infinity, the same reasoning applies: numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so limit 1/3.

Therefore, seems like regardless of the approach path, the limit is 1/3.

But let me check with another example where x approaches 0 in a different way, say x = 1/(n + ε), where ε is a fixed between 0 and1. For instance, ε=0.1. Then [1/x] = n, sum is up to n, x³ =1/(n +0.1)^3. Then expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n +0.1)^3. Again, as n→∞, numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so expression ~1/3.

Alternatively, take x approaching 0 through x=1/(n - 0.1). Then [1/x] = [n -0.1] = n -1. Wait, but 1/x =n -0.1, so [1/x] = n -1. Then sum is up to n -1. So expression is [(n -1)n(2n -1)/6]/(n -0.1)^3. Let&#x27;s compute this:

Numerator: (n -1)n(2n -1) ≈ (n² -n)(2n -1) ≈2n³ -n² -2n² +n ≈2n³ -3n² +n ~2n³

Denominator:6(n -0.1)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.1/n)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.3/n + ...) ~6n³

Thus, the expression ~2n³/(6n³)=1/3. So still converges to 1/3.

Therefore, regardless of how x approaches 0, as long as we take the limit, the expression tends to 1/3.

But wait, in the initial approximation, we neglected the δ term, assuming that n ≈1/x. But even when we considered δ, the correction terms ended up vanishing in the limit. Therefore, the limit is indeed 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use integral approximation for the sum. The sum from k=1 to n of k² is approximately the integral from 0 to n of t² dt, which is n³/3. But the sum is actually larger than the integral. The integral from 0 to n of t² dt = n³/3, and the sum from k=1 to n of k² is ~n³/3 + n²/2 + n/6. So the leading term is n³/3. So when we multiply by x³, and since n = [1/x] ≈1/x, the leading term is (1/x)³/3 *x³ =1/3, which matches our previous result. The next term would be n²/2 ~ (1/x²)/2 *x³ =x/2, which tends to 0. So this also suggests that the limit is 1/3.

Therefore, multiple approaches confirm that the limit is 1/3.

To find the limit \(\lim \limits_{x \to 0} \ x^3\Big(1+2^2+3^2+\ldots+\Big[\frac{1}{\vert x \vert}\Big]^2\Big)\), we start by noting that as \(x \to 0\), \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) becomes very large. Let \(n = \left[\frac{1}{|x|}\right]\), which is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{|x|}\). The sum of squares from 1 to \(n\) is given by the formula:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\]

Substituting \(n \approx \frac{1}{|x|}\) (since \(n\) is the integer part of \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) and the difference becomes negligible as \(x \to 0\)), we approximate the sum:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right)\left(\frac{1}{|x|} + 1\right)\left(2\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right) + 1\right)}{6}
\]

Expanding and simplifying the terms, we get:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{1}{|x|^3} \cdot \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|^2} \cdot \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|} \cdot \frac{1}{6}
\]

Multiplying this sum by \(x^3\) and considering the leading terms as \(x \to 0\):

\[
x^3 \left( \frac{2}{6|x|^3} + \frac{3}{6|x|^2} + \frac{1}{6|x|} \right) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{6}
\]

As \(x \to 0\), the terms \(\frac{x}{2}\) and \(\frac{x^2}{6}\) approach 0, leaving the limit as:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limit as x approaches 0 of x cubed multiplied by the sum of squares from 1 up to [1/|x|], where [.] is the greatest integer function. Hmm, let me start by understanding what this sum looks like.

First, when x approaches 0, 1/|x| becomes very large. So, [1/|x|] is the integer part of 1/|x|. Let&#x27;s denote n = [1/|x|]. Then, the sum in question is 1² + 2² + 3² + ... + n². I remember there&#x27;s a formula for the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers. Let me recall it. I think it&#x27;s n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Let me verify that. For example, if n=1, sum is 1, formula gives 1*2*3/6=6/6=1. If n=2, sum is 1+4=5, formula gives 2*3*5/6=30/6=5. Yeah, that seems right. So the sum is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6.

So substituting back, the expression becomes x³ * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6], where n = [1/|x|]. Since x is approaching 0, n is a large integer. So maybe I can approximate n as approximately 1/|x|, since [1/|x|] is the integer part, but as x approaches 0, the difference between 1/|x| and [1/|x|] becomes negligible. Is that right? Let&#x27;s see. For example, if x is approaching 0 from the positive side, then |x| = x, and [1/x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 1/x. So 1/x - 1 &lt; [1/x] ≤ 1/x. Therefore, as x approaches 0, 1/x becomes very large, and [1/x] ≈ 1/x with an error of less than 1. So maybe we can replace n with 1/|x| in the formula, but we need to be careful with the error terms.

So substituting n ≈ 1/|x|, then the sum becomes approximately (1/|x|)(1/|x| + 1)(2*(1/|x|) + 1)/6. Let me write this out:

Sum ≈ (1/|x|) * (1/|x| + 1) * (2/|x| + 1)/6

Multiply these terms out:

First, multiply (1/|x| + 1) and (2/|x| + 1):

(1/|x|)(2/|x|) + (1/|x|)(1) + 1*(2/|x|) + 1*1

= 2/|x|² + 1/|x| + 2/|x| + 1

= 2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1

Then multiply by (1/|x|)/6:

(1/|x|)/6 * (2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1) = (2/|x|³ + 3/|x|² + 1/|x|)/6

So the sum is approximately (2/(6|x|³) + 3/(6|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)) = (1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|))

Now, the original expression is x³ times this sum:

x³ * [1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)]

Since x is approaching 0, let&#x27;s consider x approaching 0 from the positive side first, so |x| = x. Then, we can write:

x³ * [1/(3x³) + 1/(2x²) + 1/(6x)] = x³*(1/(3x³)) + x³*(1/(2x²)) + x³*(1/(6x))

Simplify each term:

First term: x³/(3x³) = 1/3

Second term: x³/(2x²) = x/2

Third term: x³/(6x) = x²/6

As x approaches 0, the second and third terms approach 0, so the entire expression approaches 1/3.

But wait, is this correct? Because we approximated n as 1/x, but actually n = [1/x], which is 1/x minus a fractional part less than 1. So n = 1/x - {1/x}, where {1/x} is the fractional part. Therefore, n = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. So when we plug n into the sum formula, maybe we need to consider the effect of δ?

Hmm, let&#x27;s analyze that. Let me write n = [1/x] = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. Then, the sum is:

Sum = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 = (1/x - δ)(1/x - δ + 1)(2(1/x - δ) + 1)/6

This looks complicated. Let&#x27;s expand this expression step by step.

First, compute each bracket:

First term: (1/x - δ)

Second term: (1/x - δ + 1) = (1/x + 1 - δ)

Third term: 2(1/x - δ) + 1 = 2/x - 2δ + 1

Multiply all three terms:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ)(2/x + 1 - 2δ)

This seems messy, but maybe we can expand this in terms of 1/x. Since δ is between 0 and 1, and x is approaching 0, 1/x is large, so terms with higher powers of 1/x will dominate.

Let me expand the first two factors first:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ) = (1/x)(1/x + 1 - δ) - δ(1/x + 1 - δ)

= (1/x² + (1 - δ)/x) - (δ/x + δ(1 - δ))

= 1/x² + (1 - δ)/x - δ/x - δ(1 - δ)

Simplify:

1/x² + [ (1 - δ) - δ ] /x - δ(1 - δ)

= 1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²

Now multiply this by the third factor (2/x + 1 - 2δ):

[1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²] * [2/x + 1 - 2δ]

Let&#x27;s multiply term by term:

First term: 1/x² * 2/x = 2/x³

Second term: 1/x² * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)/x²

Third term: (1 - 2δ)/x * 2/x = 2(1 - 2δ)/x²

Fourth term: (1 - 2δ)/x * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)^2 /x

Fifth term: (-δ + δ²) * 2/x = (-2δ + 2δ²)/x

Sixth term: (-δ + δ²) * (1 - 2δ) = -δ(1 - 2δ) + δ²(1 - 2δ) = -δ + 2δ² + δ² - 2δ³ = -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So combining all terms:

2/x³ + (1 - 2δ)/x² + 2(1 - 2δ)/x² + (1 - 2δ)^2 /x + (-2δ + 2δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Combine like terms:

For 1/x³: 2/x³

For 1/x²: [ (1 - 2δ) + 2(1 - 2δ) ] /x² = [1 - 2δ + 2 - 4δ]/x² = (3 - 6δ)/x²

For 1/x: [ (1 - 2δ)^2 + (-2δ + 2δ²) ] /x

Let me compute (1 - 2δ)^2:

= 1 - 4δ + 4δ²

So adding (-2δ + 2δ²):

1 - 4δ + 4δ² -2δ + 2δ² = 1 - 6δ + 6δ²

Therefore, the 1/x term is (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x

Constant term: -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So overall, the product is:

2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Therefore, the sum is:

[2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)] /6

So when we multiply this by x³, the original expression becomes:

x³ * Sum ≈ x³ * [2/(6x³) + (3 - 6δ)/(6x²) + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6]

Simplify each term:

First term: x³*(2)/(6x³) = 2/6 = 1/3

Second term: x³*(3 - 6δ)/(6x²) = (3 - 6δ)x/(6) = (1 - 2δ)x/2

Third term: x³*(1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) = (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)x²/6

Fourth term: x³*(-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6 = (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)x³/6

Now, as x approaches 0, δ is between 0 and 1. So δ is bounded. Therefore, the second term is O(x), the third term is O(x²), and the fourth term is O(x³). All of these go to 0 as x approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is determined by the first term, which is 1/3. So the limit is 1/3?

But wait, but δ is dependent on x. Since δ = 1/x - n, where n is [1/x], so δ = {1/x}, the fractional part of 1/x. So as x approaches 0, 1/x can be written as integer plus fractional part. So δ is between 0 and 1. However, as x approaches 0, depending on the sequence of x&#x27;s approaching 0, δ can oscillate between 0 and 1. For example, if x approaches 0 through 1/n for integer n, then δ = 0. If x approaches 0 through 1/(n + 0.5), then δ = 0.5. So δ can vary. However, in our calculation above, the only term that could possibly depend on δ is the second term (1 - 2δ)x/2, but even though δ varies between 0 and 1, as x approaches 0, (1 - 2δ) is bounded (since δ is between 0 and1, 1 - 2δ is between -1 and1), so (1 - 2δ)x/2 approaches 0 as x approaches 0 regardless of δ. Similarly, the other terms also vanish. Therefore, regardless of the value of δ, the limit is 1/3. So maybe the answer is 1/3.

But let me check with specific sequences. Suppose x approaches 0 through the sequence x_n = 1/n, where n is a positive integer. Then [1/x] = [n] = n. Then the sum is 1² + 2² + ... + n² = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Multiply by x³ = (1/n³):

So expression is (1/n³) * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6] = [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n³) = [(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n²)

Expand numerator: (n + 1)(2n +1) = 2n² + 3n +1

Therefore, expression is (2n² + 3n +1)/(6n²) = (2 + 3/n + 1/n²)/6

As n approaches infinity, this approaches (2 + 0 +0)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3. So that&#x27;s consistent.

Now, take another sequence where x approaches 0 through x = 1/(n + 0.5), where n is integer. Then [1/x] = [n + 0.5] = n. So sum is still up to n, same as before. Then x = 1/(n + 0.5), so x³ = 1/(n + 0.5)^3, and the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + 0.5)^3.

Let me compute this as n approaches infinity. Let&#x27;s write n + 0.5 as n(1 + 0.5/n). Then denominator is (n(1 + 0.5/n))³ = n³(1 + 0.5/n)^3 ≈ n³(1 + 1.5/n + ...) by binomial expansion.

Numerator: n(n +1)(2n +1) ≈ n*(n)(2n) = 2n³. So numerator ≈2n³, denominator≈6n³. Therefore, expression ≈2n³/(6n³) = 1/3. The higher order terms would be lower order in n, so as n approaches infinity, the expression still approaches 1/3. So regardless of how x approaches 0, the limit seems to be 1/3.

But let me test with x approaching 0 through some irrational sequence. For example, x = 1/(n + sqrt(2)), but here [1/x] would still be n, as 1/x = n + sqrt(2), so [1/x] = n. So similar to the previous case, the sum would be up to n, and x³ = 1/(n + sqrt(2))³. Then the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + sqrt(2))³. As n approaches infinity, the same reasoning applies: numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so limit 1/3.

Therefore, seems like regardless of the approach path, the limit is 1/3.

But let me check with another example where x approaches 0 in a different way, say x = 1/(n + ε), where ε is a fixed between 0 and1. For instance, ε=0.1. Then [1/x] = n, sum is up to n, x³ =1/(n +0.1)^3. Then expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n +0.1)^3. Again, as n→∞, numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so expression ~1/3.

Alternatively, take x approaching 0 through x=1/(n - 0.1). Then [1/x] = [n -0.1] = n -1. Wait, but 1/x =n -0.1, so [1/x] = n -1. Then sum is up to n -1. So expression is [(n -1)n(2n -1)/6]/(n -0.1)^3. Let&#x27;s compute this:

Numerator: (n -1)n(2n -1) ≈ (n² -n)(2n -1) ≈2n³ -n² -2n² +n ≈2n³ -3n² +n ~2n³

Denominator:6(n -0.1)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.1/n)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.3/n + ...) ~6n³

Thus, the expression ~2n³/(6n³)=1/3. So still converges to 1/3.

Therefore, regardless of how x approaches 0, as long as we take the limit, the expression tends to 1/3.

But wait, in the initial approximation, we neglected the δ term, assuming that n ≈1/x. But even when we considered δ, the correction terms ended up vanishing in the limit. Therefore, the limit is indeed 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use integral approximation for the sum. The sum from k=1 to n of k² is approximately the integral from 0 to n of t² dt, which is n³/3. But the sum is actually larger than the integral. The integral from 0 to n of t² dt = n³/3, and the sum from k=1 to n of k² is ~n³/3 + n²/2 + n/6. So the leading term is n³/3. So when we multiply by x³, and since n = [1/x] ≈1/x, the leading term is (1/x)³/3 *x³ =1/3, which matches our previous result. The next term would be n²/2 ~ (1/x²)/2 *x³ =x/2, which tends to 0. So this also suggests that the limit is 1/3.

Therefore, multiple approaches confirm that the limit is 1/3.

**Final Answer**

To find the limit \(\lim \limits_{x \to 0} \ x^3\Big(1+2^2+3^2+\ldots+\Big[\frac{1}{\vert x \vert}\Big]^2\Big)\), we start by noting that as \(x \to 0\), \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) becomes very large. Let \(n = \left[\frac{1}{|x|}\right]\), which is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{|x|}\). The sum of squares from 1 to \(n\) is given by the formula:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\]

Substituting \(n \approx \frac{1}{|x|}\) (since \(n\) is the integer part of \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) and the difference becomes negligible as \(x \to 0\)), we approximate the sum:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right)\left(\frac{1}{|x|} + 1\right)\left(2\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right) + 1\right)}{6}
\]

Expanding and simplifying the terms, we get:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{1}{|x|^3} \cdot \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|^2} \cdot \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|} \cdot \frac{1}{6}
\]

Multiplying this sum by \(x^3\) and considering the leading terms as \(x \to 0\):

\[
x^3 \left( \frac{2}{6|x|^3} + \frac{3}{6|x|^2} + \frac{1}{6|x|} \right) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{6}
\]

As \(x \to 0\), the terms \(\frac{x}{2}\) and \(\frac{x^2}{6}\) approach 0, leaving the limit as:

\[

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limit as x approaches 0 of x cubed multiplied by the sum of squares from 1 up to [1/|x|], where [.] is the greatest integer function. Hmm, let me start by understanding what this sum looks like.

First, when x approaches 0, 1/|x| becomes very large. So, [1/|x|] is the integer part of 1/|x|. Let&#x27;s denote n = [1/|x|]. Then, the sum in question is 1² + 2² + 3² + ... + n². I remember there&#x27;s a formula for the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers. Let me recall it. I think it&#x27;s n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Let me verify that. For example, if n=1, sum is 1, formula gives 1*2*3/6=6/6=1. If n=2, sum is 1+4=5, formula gives 2*3*5/6=30/6=5. Yeah, that seems right. So the sum is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6.

So substituting back, the expression becomes x³ * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6], where n = [1/|x|]. Since x is approaching 0, n is a large integer. So maybe I can approximate n as approximately 1/|x|, since [1/|x|] is the integer part, but as x approaches 0, the difference between 1/|x| and [1/|x|] becomes negligible. Is that right? Let&#x27;s see. For example, if x is approaching 0 from the positive side, then |x| = x, and [1/x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 1/x. So 1/x - 1 &lt; [1/x] ≤ 1/x. Therefore, as x approaches 0, 1/x becomes very large, and [1/x] ≈ 1/x with an error of less than 1. So maybe we can replace n with 1/|x| in the formula, but we need to be careful with the error terms.

So substituting n ≈ 1/|x|, then the sum becomes approximately (1/|x|)(1/|x| + 1)(2*(1/|x|) + 1)/6. Let me write this out:

Sum ≈ (1/|x|) * (1/|x| + 1) * (2/|x| + 1)/6

Multiply these terms out:

First, multiply (1/|x| + 1) and (2/|x| + 1):

(1/|x|)(2/|x|) + (1/|x|)(1) + 1*(2/|x|) + 1*1

= 2/|x|² + 1/|x| + 2/|x| + 1

= 2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1

Then multiply by (1/|x|)/6:

(1/|x|)/6 * (2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1) = (2/|x|³ + 3/|x|² + 1/|x|)/6

So the sum is approximately (2/(6|x|³) + 3/(6|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)) = (1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|))

Now, the original expression is x³ times this sum:

x³ * [1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)]

Since x is approaching 0, let&#x27;s consider x approaching 0 from the positive side first, so |x| = x. Then, we can write:

x³ * [1/(3x³) + 1/(2x²) + 1/(6x)] = x³*(1/(3x³)) + x³*(1/(2x²)) + x³*(1/(6x))

Simplify each term:

First term: x³/(3x³) = 1/3

Second term: x³/(2x²) = x/2

Third term: x³/(6x) = x²/6

As x approaches 0, the second and third terms approach 0, so the entire expression approaches 1/3.

But wait, is this correct? Because we approximated n as 1/x, but actually n = [1/x], which is 1/x minus a fractional part less than 1. So n = 1/x - {1/x}, where {1/x} is the fractional part. Therefore, n = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. So when we plug n into the sum formula, maybe we need to consider the effect of δ?

Hmm, let&#x27;s analyze that. Let me write n = [1/x] = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. Then, the sum is:

Sum = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 = (1/x - δ)(1/x - δ + 1)(2(1/x - δ) + 1)/6

This looks complicated. Let&#x27;s expand this expression step by step.

First, compute each bracket:

First term: (1/x - δ)

Second term: (1/x - δ + 1) = (1/x + 1 - δ)

Third term: 2(1/x - δ) + 1 = 2/x - 2δ + 1

Multiply all three terms:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ)(2/x + 1 - 2δ)

This seems messy, but maybe we can expand this in terms of 1/x. Since δ is between 0 and 1, and x is approaching 0, 1/x is large, so terms with higher powers of 1/x will dominate.

Let me expand the first two factors first:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ) = (1/x)(1/x + 1 - δ) - δ(1/x + 1 - δ)

= (1/x² + (1 - δ)/x) - (δ/x + δ(1 - δ))

= 1/x² + (1 - δ)/x - δ/x - δ(1 - δ)

Simplify:

1/x² + [ (1 - δ) - δ ] /x - δ(1 - δ)

= 1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²

Now multiply this by the third factor (2/x + 1 - 2δ):

[1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²] * [2/x + 1 - 2δ]

Let&#x27;s multiply term by term:

First term: 1/x² * 2/x = 2/x³

Second term: 1/x² * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)/x²

Third term: (1 - 2δ)/x * 2/x = 2(1 - 2δ)/x²

Fourth term: (1 - 2δ)/x * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)^2 /x

Fifth term: (-δ + δ²) * 2/x = (-2δ + 2δ²)/x

Sixth term: (-δ + δ²) * (1 - 2δ) = -δ(1 - 2δ) + δ²(1 - 2δ) = -δ + 2δ² + δ² - 2δ³ = -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So combining all terms:

2/x³ + (1 - 2δ)/x² + 2(1 - 2δ)/x² + (1 - 2δ)^2 /x + (-2δ + 2δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Combine like terms:

For 1/x³: 2/x³

For 1/x²: [ (1 - 2δ) + 2(1 - 2δ) ] /x² = [1 - 2δ + 2 - 4δ]/x² = (3 - 6δ)/x²

For 1/x: [ (1 - 2δ)^2 + (-2δ + 2δ²) ] /x

Let me compute (1 - 2δ)^2:

= 1 - 4δ + 4δ²

So adding (-2δ + 2δ²):

1 - 4δ + 4δ² -2δ + 2δ² = 1 - 6δ + 6δ²

Therefore, the 1/x term is (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x

Constant term: -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So overall, the product is:

2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Therefore, the sum is:

[2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)] /6

So when we multiply this by x³, the original expression becomes:

x³ * Sum ≈ x³ * [2/(6x³) + (3 - 6δ)/(6x²) + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6]

Simplify each term:

First term: x³*(2)/(6x³) = 2/6 = 1/3

Second term: x³*(3 - 6δ)/(6x²) = (3 - 6δ)x/(6) = (1 - 2δ)x/2

Third term: x³*(1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) = (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)x²/6

Fourth term: x³*(-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6 = (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)x³/6

Now, as x approaches 0, δ is between 0 and 1. So δ is bounded. Therefore, the second term is O(x), the third term is O(x²), and the fourth term is O(x³). All of these go to 0 as x approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is determined by the first term, which is 1/3. So the limit is 1/3?

But wait, but δ is dependent on x. Since δ = 1/x - n, where n is [1/x], so δ = {1/x}, the fractional part of 1/x. So as x approaches 0, 1/x can be written as integer plus fractional part. So δ is between 0 and 1. However, as x approaches 0, depending on the sequence of x&#x27;s approaching 0, δ can oscillate between 0 and 1. For example, if x approaches 0 through 1/n for integer n, then δ = 0. If x approaches 0 through 1/(n + 0.5), then δ = 0.5. So δ can vary. However, in our calculation above, the only term that could possibly depend on δ is the second term (1 - 2δ)x/2, but even though δ varies between 0 and 1, as x approaches 0, (1 - 2δ) is bounded (since δ is between 0 and1, 1 - 2δ is between -1 and1), so (1 - 2δ)x/2 approaches 0 as x approaches 0 regardless of δ. Similarly, the other terms also vanish. Therefore, regardless of the value of δ, the limit is 1/3. So maybe the answer is 1/3.

But let me check with specific sequences. Suppose x approaches 0 through the sequence x_n = 1/n, where n is a positive integer. Then [1/x] = [n] = n. Then the sum is 1² + 2² + ... + n² = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Multiply by x³ = (1/n³):

So expression is (1/n³) * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6] = [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n³) = [(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n²)

Expand numerator: (n + 1)(2n +1) = 2n² + 3n +1

Therefore, expression is (2n² + 3n +1)/(6n²) = (2 + 3/n + 1/n²)/6

As n approaches infinity, this approaches (2 + 0 +0)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3. So that&#x27;s consistent.

Now, take another sequence where x approaches 0 through x = 1/(n + 0.5), where n is integer. Then [1/x] = [n + 0.5] = n. So sum is still up to n, same as before. Then x = 1/(n + 0.5), so x³ = 1/(n + 0.5)^3, and the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + 0.5)^3.

Let me compute this as n approaches infinity. Let&#x27;s write n + 0.5 as n(1 + 0.5/n). Then denominator is (n(1 + 0.5/n))³ = n³(1 + 0.5/n)^3 ≈ n³(1 + 1.5/n + ...) by binomial expansion.

Numerator: n(n +1)(2n +1) ≈ n*(n)(2n) = 2n³. So numerator ≈2n³, denominator≈6n³. Therefore, expression ≈2n³/(6n³) = 1/3. The higher order terms would be lower order in n, so as n approaches infinity, the expression still approaches 1/3. So regardless of how x approaches 0, the limit seems to be 1/3.

But let me test with x approaching 0 through some irrational sequence. For example, x = 1/(n + sqrt(2)), but here [1/x] would still be n, as 1/x = n + sqrt(2), so [1/x] = n. So similar to the previous case, the sum would be up to n, and x³ = 1/(n + sqrt(2))³. Then the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + sqrt(2))³. As n approaches infinity, the same reasoning applies: numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so limit 1/3.

Therefore, seems like regardless of the approach path, the limit is 1/3.

But let me check with another example where x approaches 0 in a different way, say x = 1/(n + ε), where ε is a fixed between 0 and1. For instance, ε=0.1. Then [1/x] = n, sum is up to n, x³ =1/(n +0.1)^3. Then expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n +0.1)^3. Again, as n→∞, numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so expression ~1/3.

Alternatively, take x approaching 0 through x=1/(n - 0.1). Then [1/x] = [n -0.1] = n -1. Wait, but 1/x =n -0.1, so [1/x] = n -1. Then sum is up to n -1. So expression is [(n -1)n(2n -1)/6]/(n -0.1)^3. Let&#x27;s compute this:

Numerator: (n -1)n(2n -1) ≈ (n² -n)(2n -1) ≈2n³ -n² -2n² +n ≈2n³ -3n² +n ~2n³

Denominator:6(n -0.1)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.1/n)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.3/n + ...) ~6n³

Thus, the expression ~2n³/(6n³)=1/3. So still converges to 1/3.

Therefore, regardless of how x approaches 0, as long as we take the limit, the expression tends to 1/3.

But wait, in the initial approximation, we neglected the δ term, assuming that n ≈1/x. But even when we considered δ, the correction terms ended up vanishing in the limit. Therefore, the limit is indeed 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use integral approximation for the sum. The sum from k=1 to n of k² is approximately the integral from 0 to n of t² dt, which is n³/3. But the sum is actually larger than the integral. The integral from 0 to n of t² dt = n³/3, and the sum from k=1 to n of k² is ~n³/3 + n²/2 + n/6. So the leading term is n³/3. So when we multiply by x³, and since n = [1/x] ≈1/x, the leading term is (1/x)³/3 *x³ =1/3, which matches our previous result. The next term would be n²/2 ~ (1/x²)/2 *x³ =x/2, which tends to 0. So this also suggests that the limit is 1/3.

Therefore, multiple approaches confirm that the limit is 1/3.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}

To find the limit \(\lim \limits_{x \to 0} \ x^3\Big(1+2^2+3^2+\ldots+\Big[\frac{1}{\vert x \vert}\Big]^2\Big)\), we start by noting that as \(x \to 0\), \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) becomes very large. Let \(n = \left[\frac{1}{|x|}\right]\), which is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{|x|}\). The sum of squares from 1 to \(n\) is given by the formula:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\]

Substituting \(n \approx \frac{1}{|x|}\) (since \(n\) is the integer part of \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) and the difference becomes negligible as \(x \to 0\)), we approximate the sum:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right)\left(\frac{1}{|x|} + 1\right)\left(2\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right) + 1\right)}{6}
\]

Expanding and simplifying the terms, we get:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{1}{|x|^3} \cdot \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|^2} \cdot \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|} \cdot \frac{1}{6}
\]

Multiplying this sum by \(x^3\) and considering the leading terms as \(x \to 0\):

\[
x^3 \left( \frac{2}{6|x|^3} + \frac{3}{6|x|^2} + \frac{1}{6|x|} \right) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{6}
\]

As \(x \to 0\), the terms \(\frac{x}{2}\) and \(\frac{x^2}{6}\) approach 0, leaving the limit as:

\[

For example, if n=1, sum is 1, formula gives 1*2*3/6=6/6=1. If n=2, sum is 1+4=5, formula gives 2*3*5/6=30/6=5. Yeah, that seems right. So the sum is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6.

So substituting back, the expression becomes x³ * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6], where n = [1/|x|]. Since x is approaching 0, n is a large integer. So maybe I can approximate n as approximately 1/|x|, since [1/|x|] is the integer part, but as x approaches 0, the difference between 1/|x| and [1/|x|] becomes negligible. Is that right?

So maybe we can replace n with 1/|x| in the formula, but we need to be careful with the error terms.

So substituting n ≈ 1/|x|, then the sum becomes approximately (1/|x|)(1/|x| + 1)(2*(1/|x|) + 1)/6. Let me write this out:

Sum ≈ (1/|x|) * (1/|x| + 1) * (2/|x| + 1)/6

Multiply these terms out:

First, multiply (1/|x| + 1) and (2/|x| + 1):

(1/|x|)(2/|x|) + (1/|x|)(1) + 1*(2/|x|) + 1*1

= 2/|x|² + 1/|x| + 2/|x| + 1

= 2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1

Then multiply by (1/|x|)/6:

(1/|x|)/6 * (2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1) = (2/|x|³ + 3/|x|² + 1/|x|)/6

So the sum is approximately (2/(6|x|³) + 3/(6|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)) = (1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|))

Now, the original expression is x³ times this sum:

x³ * [1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)]

Since x is approaching 0, let&#x27;s consider x approaching 0 from the positive side first, so |x| = x. Then, we can write:

x³ * [1/(3x³) + 1/(2x²) + 1/(6x)] = x³*(1/(3x³)) + x³*(1/(2x²)) + x³*(1/(6x))

Simplify each term:

First term: x³/(3x³) = 1/3

Second term: x³/(2x²) = x/2

Third term: x³/(6x) = x²/6

As x approaches 0, the second and third terms approach 0, so the entire expression approaches 1/3.

Hmm, let&#x27;s analyze that. Let me write n = [1/x] = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. Then, the sum is:

Sum = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 = (1/x - δ)(1/x - δ + 1)(2(1/x - δ) + 1)/6

This looks complicated. Let&#x27;s expand this expression step by step.

First, compute each bracket:

First term: (1/x - δ)

Second term: (1/x - δ + 1) = (1/x + 1 - δ)

Third term: 2(1/x - δ) + 1 = 2/x - 2δ + 1

Multiply all three terms:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ)(2/x + 1 - 2δ)

This seems messy, but maybe we can expand this in terms of 1/x. Since δ is between 0 and 1, and x is approaching 0, 1/x is large, so terms with higher powers of 1/x will dominate.

Let me expand the first two factors first:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ) = (1/x)(1/x + 1 - δ) - δ(1/x + 1 - δ)

= (1/x² + (1 - δ)/x) - (δ/x + δ(1 - δ))

= 1/x² + (1 - δ)/x - δ/x - δ(1 - δ)

Simplify:

1/x² + [ (1 - δ) - δ ] /x - δ(1 - δ)

= 1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²

Now multiply this by the third factor (2/x + 1 - 2δ):

[1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²] * [2/x + 1 - 2δ]

Let&#x27;s multiply term by term:

First term: 1/x² * 2/x = 2/x³

Second term: 1/x² * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)/x²

Third term: (1 - 2δ)/x * 2/x = 2(1 - 2δ)/x²

Fourth term: (1 - 2δ)/x * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)^2 /x

Fifth term: (-δ + δ²) * 2/x = (-2δ + 2δ²)/x

Sixth term: (-δ + δ²) * (1 - 2δ) = -δ(1 - 2δ) + δ²(1 - 2δ) = -δ + 2δ² + δ² - 2δ³ = -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So combining all terms:

2/x³ + (1 - 2δ)/x² + 2(1 - 2δ)/x² + (1 - 2δ)^2 /x + (-2δ + 2δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Combine like terms:

For 1/x³: 2/x³

For 1/x²: [ (1 - 2δ) + 2(1 - 2δ) ] /x² = [1 - 2δ + 2 - 4δ]/x² = (3 - 6δ)/x²

For 1/x: [ (1 - 2δ)^2 + (-2δ + 2δ²) ] /x

Let me compute (1 - 2δ)^2:

= 1 - 4δ + 4δ²

So adding (-2δ + 2δ²):

1 - 4δ + 4δ² -2δ + 2δ² = 1 - 6δ + 6δ²

Therefore, the 1/x term is (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x

Constant term: -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So overall, the product is:

2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Therefore, the sum is:

[2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)] /6

So when we multiply this by x³, the original expression becomes:

x³ * Sum ≈ x³ * [2/(6x³) + (3 - 6δ)/(6x²) + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6]

Simplify each term:

First term: x³*(2)/(6x³) = 2/6 = 1/3

Second term: x³*(3 - 6δ)/(6x²) = (3 - 6δ)x/(6) = (1 - 2δ)x/2

Third term: x³*(1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) = (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)x²/6

Fourth term: x³*(-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6 = (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)x³/6

Now, as x approaches 0, δ is between 0 and 1. So δ is bounded. Therefore, the second term is O(x), the third term is O(x²), and the fourth term is O(x³). All of these go to 0 as x approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is determined by the first term, which is 1/3. So the limit is 1/3?

But wait, but δ is dependent on x. Since δ = 1/x - n, where n is [1/x], so δ = {1/x}, the fractional part of 1/x. So as x approaches 0, 1/x can be written as integer plus fractional part. So δ is between 0 and 1. However, as x approaches 0, depending on the sequence of x&#x27;s approaching 0, δ can oscillate between 0 and 1. For example, if x approaches 0 through 1/n for integer n, then δ = 0. If x approaches 0 through 1/(n + 0.5), then δ = 0.5. So δ can vary. However, in our calculation above, the only term that could possibly depend on δ is the second term (1 - 2δ)x/2, but even though δ varies between 0 and 1, as x approaches 0, (1 - 2δ) is bounded (since δ is between 0 and1, 1 - 2δ is between -1 and1), so (1 - 2δ)x/2 approaches 0 as x approaches 0 regardless of δ. Similarly, the other terms also vanish. Therefore, regardless of the value of δ, the limit is 1/3. So maybe the answer is 1/3.

But let me check with specific sequences. Suppose x approaches 0 through the sequence x_n = 1/n, where n is a positive integer. Then [1/x] = [n] = n. Then the sum is 1² + 2² + ... + n² = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Multiply by x³ = (1/n³):

So expression is (1/n³) * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6] = [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n³) = [(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n²)

Expand numerator: (n + 1)(2n +1) = 2n² + 3n +1

Therefore, expression is (2n² + 3n +1)/(6n²) = (2 + 3/n + 1/n²)/6

As n approaches infinity, this approaches (2 + 0 +0)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3. So that&#x27;s consistent.

Now, take another sequence where x approaches 0 through x = 1/(n + 0.5), where n is integer. Then [1/x] = [n + 0.5] = n. So sum is still up to n, same as before. Then x = 1/(n + 0.5), so x³ = 1/(n + 0.5)^3, and the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + 0.5)^3.

Let me compute this as n approaches infinity. Let&#x27;s write n + 0.5 as n(1 + 0.5/n). Then denominator is (n(1 + 0.5/n))³ = n³(1 + 0.5/n)^3 ≈ n³(1 + 1.5/n + ...) by binomial expansion.

Numerator: n(n +1)(2n +1) ≈ n*(n)(2n) = 2n³. So numerator ≈2n³, denominator≈6n³. Therefore, expression ≈2n³/(6n³) = 1/3. The higher order terms would be lower order in n, so as n approaches infinity, the expression still approaches 1/3. So regardless of how x approaches 0, the limit seems to be 1/3.

But let me test with x approaching 0 through some irrational sequence. For example, x = 1/(n + sqrt(2)), but here [1/x] would still be n, as 1/x = n + sqrt(2), so [1/x] = n. So similar to the previous case, the sum would be up to n, and x³ = 1/(n + sqrt(2))³. Then the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + sqrt(2))³. As n approaches infinity, the same reasoning applies: numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so limit 1/3.

Therefore, seems like regardless of the approach path, the limit is 1/3.

But let me check with another example where x approaches 0 in a different way, say x = 1/(n + ε), where ε is a fixed between 0 and1. For instance, ε=0.1. Then [1/x] = n, sum is up to n, x³ =1/(n +0.1)^3. Then expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n +0.1)^3. Again, as n→∞, numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so expression ~1/3.

Alternatively, take x approaching 0 through x=1/(n - 0.1). Then [1/x] = [n -0.1] = n -1. Wait, but 1/x =n -0.1, so [1/x] = n -1. Then sum is up to n -1. So expression is [(n -1)n(2n -1)/6]/(n -0.1)^3. Let&#x27;s compute this:

Numerator: (n -1)n(2n -1) ≈ (n² -n)(2n -1) ≈2n³ -n² -2n² +n ≈2n³ -3n² +n ~2n³

Denominator:6(n -0.1)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.1/n)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.3/n + ...) ~6n³

Thus, the expression ~2n³/(6n³)=1/3. So still converges to 1/3.

Therefore, regardless of how x approaches 0, as long as we take the limit, the expression tends to 1/3.

But wait, in the initial approximation, we neglected the δ term, assuming that n ≈1/x. But even when we considered δ, the correction terms ended up vanishing in the limit. Therefore, the limit is indeed 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use integral approximation for the sum. The sum from k=1 to n of k² is approximately the integral from 0 to n of t² dt, which is n³/3. But the sum is actually larger than the integral. The integral from 0 to n of t² dt = n³/3, and the sum from k=1 to n of k² is ~n³/3 + n²/2 + n/6. So the leading term is n³/3. So when we multiply by x³, and since n = [1/x] ≈1/x, the leading term is (1/x)³/3 *x³ =1/3, which matches our previous result. The next term would be n²/2 ~ (1/x²)/2 *x³ =x/2, which tends to 0. So this also suggests that the limit is 1/3.

Therefore, multiple approaches confirm that the limit is 1/3.

**Final Answer**

To find the limit \(\lim \limits_{x \to 0} \ x^3\Big(1+2^2+3^2+\ldots+\Big[\frac{1}{\vert x \vert}\Big]^2\Big)\), we start by noting that as \(x \to 0\), \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) becomes very large. Let \(n = \left[\frac{1}{|x|}\right]\), which is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{|x|}\). The sum of squares from 1 to \(n\) is given by the formula:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\]

Substituting \(n \approx \frac{1}{|x|}\) (since \(n\) is the integer part of \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) and the difference becomes negligible as \(x \to 0\)), we approximate the sum:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right)\left(\frac{1}{|x|} + 1\right)\left(2\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right) + 1\right)}{6}
\]

Expanding and simplifying the terms, we get:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{1}{|x|^3} \cdot \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|^2} \cdot \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|} \cdot \frac{1}{6}
\]

Multiplying this sum by \(x^3\) and considering the leading terms as \(x \to 0\):

\[
x^3 \left( \frac{2}{6|x|^3} + \frac{3}{6|x|^2} + \frac{1}{6|x|} \right) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{6}
\]

As \(x \to 0\), the terms \(\frac{x}{2}\) and \(\frac{x^2}{6}\) approach 0, leaving the limit as:

\[

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limit as x approaches 0 of x cubed multiplied by the sum of squares from 1 up to [1/|x|], where [.] is the greatest integer function. Hmm, let me start by understanding what this sum looks like.

First, when x approaches 0, 1/|x| becomes very large. So, [1/|x|] is the integer part of 1/|x|. Let&#x27;s denote n = [1/|x|]. Then, the sum in question is 1² + 2² + 3² + ... + n². I remember there&#x27;s a formula for the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers. Let me recall it. I think it&#x27;s n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Let me verify that. For example, if n=1, sum is 1, formula gives 1*2*3/6=6/6=1. If n=2, sum is 1+4=5, formula gives 2*3*5/6=30/6=5. Yeah, that seems right. So the sum is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6.

So substituting back, the expression becomes x³ * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6], where n = [1/|x|]. Since x is approaching 0, n is a large integer. So maybe I can approximate n as approximately 1/|x|, since [1/|x|] is the integer part, but as x approaches 0, the difference between 1/|x| and [1/|x|] becomes negligible. Is that right? Let&#x27;s see. For example, if x is approaching 0 from the positive side, then |x| = x, and [1/x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 1/x. So 1/x - 1 &lt; [1/x] ≤ 1/x. Therefore, as x approaches 0, 1/x becomes very large, and [1/x] ≈ 1/x with an error of less than 1. So maybe we can replace n with 1/|x| in the formula, but we need to be careful with the error terms.

So substituting n ≈ 1/|x|, then the sum becomes approximately (1/|x|)(1/|x| + 1)(2*(1/|x|) + 1)/6. Let me write this out:

Sum ≈ (1/|x|) * (1/|x| + 1) * (2/|x| + 1)/6

Multiply these terms out:

First, multiply (1/|x| + 1) and (2/|x| + 1):

(1/|x|)(2/|x|) + (1/|x|)(1) + 1*(2/|x|) + 1*1

= 2/|x|² + 1/|x| + 2/|x| + 1

= 2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1

Then multiply by (1/|x|)/6:

(1/|x|)/6 * (2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1) = (2/|x|³ + 3/|x|² + 1/|x|)/6

So the sum is approximately (2/(6|x|³) + 3/(6|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)) = (1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|))

Now, the original expression is x³ times this sum:

x³ * [1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)]

Since x is approaching 0, let&#x27;s consider x approaching 0 from the positive side first, so |x| = x. Then, we can write:

x³ * [1/(3x³) + 1/(2x²) + 1/(6x)] = x³*(1/(3x³)) + x³*(1/(2x²)) + x³*(1/(6x))

Simplify each term:

First term: x³/(3x³) = 1/3

Second term: x³/(2x²) = x/2

Third term: x³/(6x) = x²/6

As x approaches 0, the second and third terms approach 0, so the entire expression approaches 1/3.

But wait, is this correct? Because we approximated n as 1/x, but actually n = [1/x], which is 1/x minus a fractional part less than 1. So n = 1/x - {1/x}, where {1/x} is the fractional part. Therefore, n = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. So when we plug n into the sum formula, maybe we need to consider the effect of δ?

Hmm, let&#x27;s analyze that. Let me write n = [1/x] = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. Then, the sum is:

Sum = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 = (1/x - δ)(1/x - δ + 1)(2(1/x - δ) + 1)/6

This looks complicated. Let&#x27;s expand this expression step by step.

First, compute each bracket:

First term: (1/x - δ)

Second term: (1/x - δ + 1) = (1/x + 1 - δ)

Third term: 2(1/x - δ) + 1 = 2/x - 2δ + 1

Multiply all three terms:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ)(2/x + 1 - 2δ)

This seems messy, but maybe we can expand this in terms of 1/x. Since δ is between 0 and 1, and x is approaching 0, 1/x is large, so terms with higher powers of 1/x will dominate.

Let me expand the first two factors first:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ) = (1/x)(1/x + 1 - δ) - δ(1/x + 1 - δ)

= (1/x² + (1 - δ)/x) - (δ/x + δ(1 - δ))

= 1/x² + (1 - δ)/x - δ/x - δ(1 - δ)

Simplify:

1/x² + [ (1 - δ) - δ ] /x - δ(1 - δ)

= 1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²

Now multiply this by the third factor (2/x + 1 - 2δ):

[1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²] * [2/x + 1 - 2δ]

Let&#x27;s multiply term by term:

First term: 1/x² * 2/x = 2/x³

Second term: 1/x² * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)/x²

Third term: (1 - 2δ)/x * 2/x = 2(1 - 2δ)/x²

Fourth term: (1 - 2δ)/x * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)^2 /x

Fifth term: (-δ + δ²) * 2/x = (-2δ + 2δ²)/x

Sixth term: (-δ + δ²) * (1 - 2δ) = -δ(1 - 2δ) + δ²(1 - 2δ) = -δ + 2δ² + δ² - 2δ³ = -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So combining all terms:

2/x³ + (1 - 2δ)/x² + 2(1 - 2δ)/x² + (1 - 2δ)^2 /x + (-2δ + 2δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Combine like terms:

For 1/x³: 2/x³

For 1/x²: [ (1 - 2δ) + 2(1 - 2δ) ] /x² = [1 - 2δ + 2 - 4δ]/x² = (3 - 6δ)/x²

For 1/x: [ (1 - 2δ)^2 + (-2δ + 2δ²) ] /x

Let me compute (1 - 2δ)^2:

= 1 - 4δ + 4δ²

So adding (-2δ + 2δ²):

1 - 4δ + 4δ² -2δ + 2δ² = 1 - 6δ + 6δ²

Therefore, the 1/x term is (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x

Constant term: -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So overall, the product is:

2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Therefore, the sum is:

[2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)] /6

So when we multiply this by x³, the original expression becomes:

x³ * Sum ≈ x³ * [2/(6x³) + (3 - 6δ)/(6x²) + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6]

Simplify each term:

First term: x³*(2)/(6x³) = 2/6 = 1/3

Second term: x³*(3 - 6δ)/(6x²) = (3 - 6δ)x/(6) = (1 - 2δ)x/2

Third term: x³*(1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) = (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)x²/6

Fourth term: x³*(-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6 = (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)x³/6

Now, as x approaches 0, δ is between 0 and 1. So δ is bounded. Therefore, the second term is O(x), the third term is O(x²), and the fourth term is O(x³). All of these go to 0 as x approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is determined by the first term, which is 1/3. So the limit is 1/3?

But wait, but δ is dependent on x. Since δ = 1/x - n, where n is [1/x], so δ = {1/x}, the fractional part of 1/x. So as x approaches 0, 1/x can be written as integer plus fractional part. So δ is between 0 and 1. However, as x approaches 0, depending on the sequence of x&#x27;s approaching 0, δ can oscillate between 0 and 1. For example, if x approaches 0 through 1/n for integer n, then δ = 0. If x approaches 0 through 1/(n + 0.5), then δ = 0.5. So δ can vary. However, in our calculation above, the only term that could possibly depend on δ is the second term (1 - 2δ)x/2, but even though δ varies between 0 and 1, as x approaches 0, (1 - 2δ) is bounded (since δ is between 0 and1, 1 - 2δ is between -1 and1), so (1 - 2δ)x/2 approaches 0 as x approaches 0 regardless of δ. Similarly, the other terms also vanish. Therefore, regardless of the value of δ, the limit is 1/3. So maybe the answer is 1/3.

But let me check with specific sequences. Suppose x approaches 0 through the sequence x_n = 1/n, where n is a positive integer. Then [1/x] = [n] = n. Then the sum is 1² + 2² + ... + n² = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Multiply by x³ = (1/n³):

So expression is (1/n³) * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6] = [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n³) = [(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n²)

Expand numerator: (n + 1)(2n +1) = 2n² + 3n +1

Therefore, expression is (2n² + 3n +1)/(6n²) = (2 + 3/n + 1/n²)/6

As n approaches infinity, this approaches (2 + 0 +0)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3. So that&#x27;s consistent.

Now, take another sequence where x approaches 0 through x = 1/(n + 0.5), where n is integer. Then [1/x] = [n + 0.5] = n. So sum is still up to n, same as before. Then x = 1/(n + 0.5), so x³ = 1/(n + 0.5)^3, and the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + 0.5)^3.

Let me compute this as n approaches infinity. Let&#x27;s write n + 0.5 as n(1 + 0.5/n). Then denominator is (n(1 + 0.5/n))³ = n³(1 + 0.5/n)^3 ≈ n³(1 + 1.5/n + ...) by binomial expansion.

Numerator: n(n +1)(2n +1) ≈ n*(n)(2n) = 2n³. So numerator ≈2n³, denominator≈6n³. Therefore, expression ≈2n³/(6n³) = 1/3. The higher order terms would be lower order in n, so as n approaches infinity, the expression still approaches 1/3. So regardless of how x approaches 0, the limit seems to be 1/3.

But let me test with x approaching 0 through some irrational sequence. For example, x = 1/(n + sqrt(2)), but here [1/x] would still be n, as 1/x = n + sqrt(2), so [1/x] = n. So similar to the previous case, the sum would be up to n, and x³ = 1/(n + sqrt(2))³. Then the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + sqrt(2))³. As n approaches infinity, the same reasoning applies: numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so limit 1/3.

Therefore, seems like regardless of the approach path, the limit is 1/3.

But let me check with another example where x approaches 0 in a different way, say x = 1/(n + ε), where ε is a fixed between 0 and1. For instance, ε=0.1. Then [1/x] = n, sum is up to n, x³ =1/(n +0.1)^3. Then expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n +0.1)^3. Again, as n→∞, numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so expression ~1/3.

Alternatively, take x approaching 0 through x=1/(n - 0.1). Then [1/x] = [n -0.1] = n -1. Wait, but 1/x =n -0.1, so [1/x] = n -1. Then sum is up to n -1. So expression is [(n -1)n(2n -1)/6]/(n -0.1)^3. Let&#x27;s compute this:

Numerator: (n -1)n(2n -1) ≈ (n² -n)(2n -1) ≈2n³ -n² -2n² +n ≈2n³ -3n² +n ~2n³

Denominator:6(n -0.1)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.1/n)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.3/n + ...) ~6n³

Thus, the expression ~2n³/(6n³)=1/3. So still converges to 1/3.

Therefore, regardless of how x approaches 0, as long as we take the limit, the expression tends to 1/3.

But wait, in the initial approximation, we neglected the δ term, assuming that n ≈1/x. But even when we considered δ, the correction terms ended up vanishing in the limit. Therefore, the limit is indeed 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use integral approximation for the sum. The sum from k=1 to n of k² is approximately the integral from 0 to n of t² dt, which is n³/3. But the sum is actually larger than the integral. The integral from 0 to n of t² dt = n³/3, and the sum from k=1 to n of k² is ~n³/3 + n²/2 + n/6. So the leading term is n³/3. So when we multiply by x³, and since n = [1/x] ≈1/x, the leading term is (1/x)³/3 *x³ =1/3, which matches our previous result. The next term would be n²/2 ~ (1/x²)/2 *x³ =x/2, which tends to 0. So this also suggests that the limit is 1/3.

Therefore, multiple approaches confirm that the limit is 1/3.

To find the limit \(\lim \limits_{x \to 0} \ x^3\Big(1+2^2+3^2+\ldots+\Big[\frac{1}{\vert x \vert}\Big]^2\Big)\), we start by noting that as \(x \to 0\), \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) becomes very large. Let \(n = \left[\frac{1}{|x|}\right]\), which is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{|x|}\). The sum of squares from 1 to \(n\) is given by the formula:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\]

Substituting \(n \approx \frac{1}{|x|}\) (since \(n\) is the integer part of \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) and the difference becomes negligible as \(x \to 0\)), we approximate the sum:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right)\left(\frac{1}{|x|} + 1\right)\left(2\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right) + 1\right)}{6}
\]

Expanding and simplifying the terms, we get:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{1}{|x|^3} \cdot \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|^2} \cdot \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|} \cdot \frac{1}{6}
\]

Multiplying this sum by \(x^3\) and considering the leading terms as \(x \to 0\):

\[
x^3 \left( \frac{2}{6|x|^3} + \frac{3}{6|x|^2} + \frac{1}{6|x|} \right) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{6}
\]

As \(x \to 0\), the terms \(\frac{x}{2}\) and \(\frac{x^2}{6}\) approach 0, leaving the limit as:

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limit as x approaches 0 of x cubed multiplied by the sum of squares from 1 up to [1/|x|], where [.] is the greatest integer function. Hmm, let me start by understanding what this sum looks like.

First, when x approaches 0, 1/|x| becomes very large. So, [1/|x|] is the integer part of 1/|x|. Let&#x27;s denote n = [1/|x|]. Then, the sum in question is 1² + 2² + 3² + ... + n². I remember there&#x27;s a formula for the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers. Let me recall it. I think it&#x27;s n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Let me verify that. For example, if n=1, sum is 1, formula gives 1*2*3/6=6/6=1. If n=2, sum is 1+4=5, formula gives 2*3*5/6=30/6=5. Yeah, that seems right. So the sum is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6.

So substituting back, the expression becomes x³ * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6], where n = [1/|x|]. Since x is approaching 0, n is a large integer. So maybe I can approximate n as approximately 1/|x|, since [1/|x|] is the integer part, but as x approaches 0, the difference between 1/|x| and [1/|x|] becomes negligible. Is that right? Let&#x27;s see. For example, if x is approaching 0 from the positive side, then |x| = x, and [1/x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 1/x. So 1/x - 1 &lt; [1/x] ≤ 1/x. Therefore, as x approaches 0, 1/x becomes very large, and [1/x] ≈ 1/x with an error of less than 1. So maybe we can replace n with 1/|x| in the formula, but we need to be careful with the error terms.

So substituting n ≈ 1/|x|, then the sum becomes approximately (1/|x|)(1/|x| + 1)(2*(1/|x|) + 1)/6. Let me write this out:

Sum ≈ (1/|x|) * (1/|x| + 1) * (2/|x| + 1)/6

Multiply these terms out:

First, multiply (1/|x| + 1) and (2/|x| + 1):

(1/|x|)(2/|x|) + (1/|x|)(1) + 1*(2/|x|) + 1*1

= 2/|x|² + 1/|x| + 2/|x| + 1

= 2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1

Then multiply by (1/|x|)/6:

(1/|x|)/6 * (2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1) = (2/|x|³ + 3/|x|² + 1/|x|)/6

So the sum is approximately (2/(6|x|³) + 3/(6|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)) = (1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|))

Now, the original expression is x³ times this sum:

x³ * [1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)]

Since x is approaching 0, let&#x27;s consider x approaching 0 from the positive side first, so |x| = x. Then, we can write:

x³ * [1/(3x³) + 1/(2x²) + 1/(6x)] = x³*(1/(3x³)) + x³*(1/(2x²)) + x³*(1/(6x))

Simplify each term:

First term: x³/(3x³) = 1/3

Second term: x³/(2x²) = x/2

Third term: x³/(6x) = x²/6

As x approaches 0, the second and third terms approach 0, so the entire expression approaches 1/3.

But wait, is this correct? Because we approximated n as 1/x, but actually n = [1/x], which is 1/x minus a fractional part less than 1. So n = 1/x - {1/x}, where {1/x} is the fractional part. Therefore, n = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. So when we plug n into the sum formula, maybe we need to consider the effect of δ?

Hmm, let&#x27;s analyze that. Let me write n = [1/x] = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. Then, the sum is:

Sum = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 = (1/x - δ)(1/x - δ + 1)(2(1/x - δ) + 1)/6

This looks complicated. Let&#x27;s expand this expression step by step.

First, compute each bracket:

First term: (1/x - δ)

Second term: (1/x - δ + 1) = (1/x + 1 - δ)

Third term: 2(1/x - δ) + 1 = 2/x - 2δ + 1

Multiply all three terms:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ)(2/x + 1 - 2δ)

This seems messy, but maybe we can expand this in terms of 1/x. Since δ is between 0 and 1, and x is approaching 0, 1/x is large, so terms with higher powers of 1/x will dominate.

Let me expand the first two factors first:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ) = (1/x)(1/x + 1 - δ) - δ(1/x + 1 - δ)

= (1/x² + (1 - δ)/x) - (δ/x + δ(1 - δ))

= 1/x² + (1 - δ)/x - δ/x - δ(1 - δ)

Simplify:

1/x² + [ (1 - δ) - δ ] /x - δ(1 - δ)

= 1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²

Now multiply this by the third factor (2/x + 1 - 2δ):

[1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²] * [2/x + 1 - 2δ]

Let&#x27;s multiply term by term:

First term: 1/x² * 2/x = 2/x³

Second term: 1/x² * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)/x²

Third term: (1 - 2δ)/x * 2/x = 2(1 - 2δ)/x²

Fourth term: (1 - 2δ)/x * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)^2 /x

Fifth term: (-δ + δ²) * 2/x = (-2δ + 2δ²)/x

Sixth term: (-δ + δ²) * (1 - 2δ) = -δ(1 - 2δ) + δ²(1 - 2δ) = -δ + 2δ² + δ² - 2δ³ = -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So combining all terms:

2/x³ + (1 - 2δ)/x² + 2(1 - 2δ)/x² + (1 - 2δ)^2 /x + (-2δ + 2δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Combine like terms:

For 1/x³: 2/x³

For 1/x²: [ (1 - 2δ) + 2(1 - 2δ) ] /x² = [1 - 2δ + 2 - 4δ]/x² = (3 - 6δ)/x²

For 1/x: [ (1 - 2δ)^2 + (-2δ + 2δ²) ] /x

Let me compute (1 - 2δ)^2:

= 1 - 4δ + 4δ²

So adding (-2δ + 2δ²):

1 - 4δ + 4δ² -2δ + 2δ² = 1 - 6δ + 6δ²

Therefore, the 1/x term is (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x

Constant term: -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So overall, the product is:

2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Therefore, the sum is:

[2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)] /6

So when we multiply this by x³, the original expression becomes:

x³ * Sum ≈ x³ * [2/(6x³) + (3 - 6δ)/(6x²) + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6]

Simplify each term:

First term: x³*(2)/(6x³) = 2/6 = 1/3

Second term: x³*(3 - 6δ)/(6x²) = (3 - 6δ)x/(6) = (1 - 2δ)x/2

Third term: x³*(1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) = (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)x²/6

Fourth term: x³*(-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6 = (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)x³/6

Now, as x approaches 0, δ is between 0 and 1. So δ is bounded. Therefore, the second term is O(x), the third term is O(x²), and the fourth term is O(x³). All of these go to 0 as x approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is determined by the first term, which is 1/3. So the limit is 1/3?

But wait, but δ is dependent on x. Since δ = 1/x - n, where n is [1/x], so δ = {1/x}, the fractional part of 1/x. So as x approaches 0, 1/x can be written as integer plus fractional part. So δ is between 0 and 1. However, as x approaches 0, depending on the sequence of x&#x27;s approaching 0, δ can oscillate between 0 and 1. For example, if x approaches 0 through 1/n for integer n, then δ = 0. If x approaches 0 through 1/(n + 0.5), then δ = 0.5. So δ can vary. However, in our calculation above, the only term that could possibly depend on δ is the second term (1 - 2δ)x/2, but even though δ varies between 0 and 1, as x approaches 0, (1 - 2δ) is bounded (since δ is between 0 and1, 1 - 2δ is between -1 and1), so (1 - 2δ)x/2 approaches 0 as x approaches 0 regardless of δ. Similarly, the other terms also vanish. Therefore, regardless of the value of δ, the limit is 1/3. So maybe the answer is 1/3.

But let me check with specific sequences. Suppose x approaches 0 through the sequence x_n = 1/n, where n is a positive integer. Then [1/x] = [n] = n. Then the sum is 1² + 2² + ... + n² = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Multiply by x³ = (1/n³):

So expression is (1/n³) * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6] = [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n³) = [(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n²)

Expand numerator: (n + 1)(2n +1) = 2n² + 3n +1

Therefore, expression is (2n² + 3n +1)/(6n²) = (2 + 3/n + 1/n²)/6

As n approaches infinity, this approaches (2 + 0 +0)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3. So that&#x27;s consistent.

Now, take another sequence where x approaches 0 through x = 1/(n + 0.5), where n is integer. Then [1/x] = [n + 0.5] = n. So sum is still up to n, same as before. Then x = 1/(n + 0.5), so x³ = 1/(n + 0.5)^3, and the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + 0.5)^3.

Let me compute this as n approaches infinity. Let&#x27;s write n + 0.5 as n(1 + 0.5/n). Then denominator is (n(1 + 0.5/n))³ = n³(1 + 0.5/n)^3 ≈ n³(1 + 1.5/n + ...) by binomial expansion.

Numerator: n(n +1)(2n +1) ≈ n*(n)(2n) = 2n³. So numerator ≈2n³, denominator≈6n³. Therefore, expression ≈2n³/(6n³) = 1/3. The higher order terms would be lower order in n, so as n approaches infinity, the expression still approaches 1/3. So regardless of how x approaches 0, the limit seems to be 1/3.

But let me test with x approaching 0 through some irrational sequence. For example, x = 1/(n + sqrt(2)), but here [1/x] would still be n, as 1/x = n + sqrt(2), so [1/x] = n. So similar to the previous case, the sum would be up to n, and x³ = 1/(n + sqrt(2))³. Then the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + sqrt(2))³. As n approaches infinity, the same reasoning applies: numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so limit 1/3.

Therefore, seems like regardless of the approach path, the limit is 1/3.

But let me check with another example where x approaches 0 in a different way, say x = 1/(n + ε), where ε is a fixed between 0 and1. For instance, ε=0.1. Then [1/x] = n, sum is up to n, x³ =1/(n +0.1)^3. Then expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n +0.1)^3. Again, as n→∞, numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so expression ~1/3.

Alternatively, take x approaching 0 through x=1/(n - 0.1). Then [1/x] = [n -0.1] = n -1. Wait, but 1/x =n -0.1, so [1/x] = n -1. Then sum is up to n -1. So expression is [(n -1)n(2n -1)/6]/(n -0.1)^3. Let&#x27;s compute this:

Numerator: (n -1)n(2n -1) ≈ (n² -n)(2n -1) ≈2n³ -n² -2n² +n ≈2n³ -3n² +n ~2n³

Denominator:6(n -0.1)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.1/n)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.3/n + ...) ~6n³

Thus, the expression ~2n³/(6n³)=1/3. So still converges to 1/3.

Therefore, regardless of how x approaches 0, as long as we take the limit, the expression tends to 1/3.

But wait, in the initial approximation, we neglected the δ term, assuming that n ≈1/x. But even when we considered δ, the correction terms ended up vanishing in the limit. Therefore, the limit is indeed 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use integral approximation for the sum. The sum from k=1 to n of k² is approximately the integral from 0 to n of t² dt, which is n³/3. But the sum is actually larger than the integral. The integral from 0 to n of t² dt = n³/3, and the sum from k=1 to n of k² is ~n³/3 + n²/2 + n/6. So the leading term is n³/3. So when we multiply by x³, and since n = [1/x] ≈1/x, the leading term is (1/x)³/3 *x³ =1/3, which matches our previous result. The next term would be n²/2 ~ (1/x²)/2 *x³ =x/2, which tends to 0. So this also suggests that the limit is 1/3.

Therefore, multiple approaches confirm that the limit is 1/3.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the limit \(\lim \limits_{x \to 0} \ x^3\Big(1+2^2+3^2+\ldots+\Big[\frac{1}{\vert x \vert}\Big]^2\Big)\), we start by noting that as \(x \to 0\), \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) becomes very large. Let \(n = \left[\frac{1}{|x|}\right]\), which is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{|x|}\). The sum of squares from 1 to \(n\) is given by the formula:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\]

Substituting \(n \approx \frac{1}{|x|}\) (since \(n\) is the integer part of \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) and the difference becomes negligible as \(x \to 0\)), we approximate the sum:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right)\left(\frac{1}{|x|} + 1\right)\left(2\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right) + 1\right)}{6}
\]

Expanding and simplifying the terms, we get:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{1}{|x|^3} \cdot \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|^2} \cdot \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|} \cdot \frac{1}{6}
\]

Multiplying this sum by \(x^3\) and considering the leading terms as \(x \to 0\):

\[
x^3 \left( \frac{2}{6|x|^3} + \frac{3}{6|x|^2} + \frac{1}{6|x|} \right) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{6}
\]

As \(x \to 0\), the terms \(\frac{x}{2}\) and \(\frac{x^2}{6}\) approach 0, leaving the limit as:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limit as x approaches 0 of x cubed multiplied by the sum of squares from 1 up to [1/|x|], where [.] is the greatest integer function. Hmm, let me start by understanding what this sum looks like.

For example, if n=1, sum is 1, formula gives 1*2*3/6=6/6=1. If n=2, sum is 1+4=5, formula gives 2*3*5/6=30/6=5. Yeah, that seems right. So the sum is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6.

So substituting back, the expression becomes x³ * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6], where n = [1/|x|]. Since x is approaching 0, n is a large integer. So maybe I can approximate n as approximately 1/|x|, since [1/|x|] is the integer part, but as x approaches 0, the difference between 1/|x| and [1/|x|] becomes negligible. Is that right? Let&#x27;s see. For example, if x is approaching 0 from the positive side, then |x| = x, and [1/x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 1/x. So 1/x - 1 &lt; [1/x] ≤ 1/x. Therefore, as x approaches 0, 1/x becomes very large, and [1/x] ≈ 1/x with an error of less than 1. So maybe we can replace n with 1/|x| in the formula, but we need to be careful with the error terms.

So substituting n ≈ 1/|x|, then the sum becomes approximately (1/|x|)(1/|x| + 1)(2*(1/|x|) + 1)/6. Let me write this out:

Sum ≈ (1/|x|) * (1/|x| + 1) * (2/|x| + 1)/6

Multiply these terms out:

First, multiply (1/|x| + 1) and (2/|x| + 1):

(1/|x|)(2/|x|) + (1/|x|)(1) + 1*(2/|x|) + 1*1

= 2/|x|² + 1/|x| + 2/|x| + 1

= 2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1

Then multiply by (1/|x|)/6:

(1/|x|)/6 * (2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1) = (2/|x|³ + 3/|x|² + 1/|x|)/6

So the sum is approximately (2/(6|x|³) + 3/(6|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)) = (1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|))

Now, the original expression is x³ times this sum:

x³ * [1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)]

Since x is approaching 0, let&#x27;s consider x approaching 0 from the positive side first, so |x| = x. Then, we can write:

x³ * [1/(3x³) + 1/(2x²) + 1/(6x)] = x³*(1/(3x³)) + x³*(1/(2x²)) + x³*(1/(6x))

Simplify each term:

First term: x³/(3x³) = 1/3

Second term: x³/(2x²) = x/2

Third term: x³/(6x) = x²/6

As x approaches 0, the second and third terms approach 0, so the entire expression approaches 1/3.

But wait, is this correct? Because we approximated n as 1/x, but actually n = [1/x], which is 1/x minus a fractional part less than 1. So n = 1/x - {1/x}, where {1/x} is the fractional part. Therefore, n = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. So when we plug n into the sum formula, maybe we need to consider the effect of δ?

Hmm, let&#x27;s analyze that. Let me write n = [1/x] = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. Then, the sum is:

Sum = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 = (1/x - δ)(1/x - δ + 1)(2(1/x - δ) + 1)/6

This looks complicated. Let&#x27;s expand this expression step by step.

First, compute each bracket:

First term: (1/x - δ)

Second term: (1/x - δ + 1) = (1/x + 1 - δ)

Third term: 2(1/x - δ) + 1 = 2/x - 2δ + 1

Multiply all three terms:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ)(2/x + 1 - 2δ)

This seems messy, but maybe we can expand this in terms of 1/x. Since δ is between 0 and 1, and x is approaching 0, 1/x is large, so terms with higher powers of 1/x will dominate.

Let me expand the first two factors first:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ) = (1/x)(1/x + 1 - δ) - δ(1/x + 1 - δ)

= (1/x² + (1 - δ)/x) - (δ/x + δ(1 - δ))

= 1/x² + (1 - δ)/x - δ/x - δ(1 - δ)

Simplify:

1/x² + [ (1 - δ) - δ ] /x - δ(1 - δ)

= 1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²

Now multiply this by the third factor (2/x + 1 - 2δ):

[1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²] * [2/x + 1 - 2δ]

Let&#x27;s multiply term by term:

First term: 1/x² * 2/x = 2/x³

Second term: 1/x² * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)/x²

Third term: (1 - 2δ)/x * 2/x = 2(1 - 2δ)/x²

Fourth term: (1 - 2δ)/x * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)^2 /x

Fifth term: (-δ + δ²) * 2/x = (-2δ + 2δ²)/x

Sixth term: (-δ + δ²) * (1 - 2δ) = -δ(1 - 2δ) + δ²(1 - 2δ) = -δ + 2δ² + δ² - 2δ³ = -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So combining all terms:

2/x³ + (1 - 2δ)/x² + 2(1 - 2δ)/x² + (1 - 2δ)^2 /x + (-2δ + 2δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Combine like terms:

For 1/x³: 2/x³

For 1/x²: [ (1 - 2δ) + 2(1 - 2δ) ] /x² = [1 - 2δ + 2 - 4δ]/x² = (3 - 6δ)/x²

For 1/x: [ (1 - 2δ)^2 + (-2δ + 2δ²) ] /x

Let me compute (1 - 2δ)^2:

= 1 - 4δ + 4δ²

So adding (-2δ + 2δ²):

1 - 4δ + 4δ² -2δ + 2δ² = 1 - 6δ + 6δ²

Therefore, the 1/x term is (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x

Constant term: -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So overall, the product is:

2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Therefore, the sum is:

[2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)] /6

So when we multiply this by x³, the original expression becomes:

x³ * Sum ≈ x³ * [2/(6x³) + (3 - 6δ)/(6x²) + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6]

Simplify each term:

First term: x³*(2)/(6x³) = 2/6 = 1/3

Second term: x³*(3 - 6δ)/(6x²) = (3 - 6δ)x/(6) = (1 - 2δ)x/2

Third term: x³*(1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) = (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)x²/6

Fourth term: x³*(-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6 = (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)x³/6

Now, as x approaches 0, δ is between 0 and 1. So δ is bounded. Therefore, the second term is O(x), the third term is O(x²), and the fourth term is O(x³). All of these go to 0 as x approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is determined by the first term, which is 1/3. So the limit is 1/3?

But wait, but δ is dependent on x. Since δ = 1/x - n, where n is [1/x], so δ = {1/x}, the fractional part of 1/x. So as x approaches 0, 1/x can be written as integer plus fractional part. So δ is between 0 and 1. However, as x approaches 0, depending on the sequence of x&#x27;s approaching 0, δ can oscillate between 0 and 1. For example, if x approaches 0 through 1/n for integer n, then δ = 0. If x approaches 0 through 1/(n + 0.5), then δ = 0.5. So δ can vary. However, in our calculation above, the only term that could possibly depend on δ is the second term (1 - 2δ)x/2, but even though δ varies between 0 and 1, as x approaches 0, (1 - 2δ) is bounded (since δ is between 0 and1, 1 - 2δ is between -1 and1), so (1 - 2δ)x/2 approaches 0 as x approaches 0 regardless of δ. Similarly, the other terms also vanish. Therefore, regardless of the value of δ, the limit is 1/3. So maybe the answer is 1/3.

But let me check with specific sequences. Suppose x approaches 0 through the sequence x_n = 1/n, where n is a positive integer. Then [1/x] = [n] = n. Then the sum is 1² + 2² + ... + n² = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Multiply by x³ = (1/n³):

So expression is (1/n³) * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6] = [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n³) = [(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n²)

Expand numerator: (n + 1)(2n +1) = 2n² + 3n +1

Therefore, expression is (2n² + 3n +1)/(6n²) = (2 + 3/n + 1/n²)/6

As n approaches infinity, this approaches (2 + 0 +0)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3. So that&#x27;s consistent.

Now, take another sequence where x approaches 0 through x = 1/(n + 0.5), where n is integer. Then [1/x] = [n + 0.5] = n. So sum is still up to n, same as before. Then x = 1/(n + 0.5), so x³ = 1/(n + 0.5)^3, and the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + 0.5)^3.

Let me compute this as n approaches infinity. Let&#x27;s write n + 0.5 as n(1 + 0.5/n). Then denominator is (n(1 + 0.5/n))³ = n³(1 + 0.5/n)^3 ≈ n³(1 + 1.5/n + ...) by binomial expansion.

Numerator: n(n +1)(2n +1) ≈ n*(n)(2n) = 2n³. So numerator ≈2n³, denominator≈6n³. Therefore, expression ≈2n³/(6n³) = 1/3. The higher order terms would be lower order in n, so as n approaches infinity, the expression still approaches 1/3. So regardless of how x approaches 0, the limit seems to be 1/3.

But let me test with x approaching 0 through some irrational sequence. For example, x = 1/(n + sqrt(2)), but here [1/x] would still be n, as 1/x = n + sqrt(2), so [1/x] = n. So similar to the previous case, the sum would be up to n, and x³ = 1/(n + sqrt(2))³. Then the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + sqrt(2))³. As n approaches infinity, the same reasoning applies: numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so limit 1/3.

Therefore, seems like regardless of the approach path, the limit is 1/3.

But let me check with another example where x approaches 0 in a different way, say x = 1/(n + ε), where ε is a fixed between 0 and1. For instance, ε=0.1. Then [1/x] = n, sum is up to n, x³ =1/(n +0.1)^3. Then expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n +0.1)^3. Again, as n→∞, numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so expression ~1/3.

Alternatively, take x approaching 0 through x=1/(n - 0.1). Then [1/x] = [n -0.1] = n -1. Wait, but 1/x =n -0.1, so [1/x] = n -1. Then sum is up to n -1. So expression is [(n -1)n(2n -1)/6]/(n -0.1)^3. Let&#x27;s compute this:

Numerator: (n -1)n(2n -1) ≈ (n² -n)(2n -1) ≈2n³ -n² -2n² +n ≈2n³ -3n² +n ~2n³

Denominator:6(n -0.1)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.1/n)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.3/n + ...) ~6n³

Thus, the expression ~2n³/(6n³)=1/3. So still converges to 1/3.

Therefore, regardless of how x approaches 0, as long as we take the limit, the expression tends to 1/3.

But wait, in the initial approximation, we neglected the δ term, assuming that n ≈1/x. But even when we considered δ, the correction terms ended up vanishing in the limit. Therefore, the limit is indeed 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use integral approximation for the sum. The sum from k=1 to n of k² is approximately the integral from 0 to n of t² dt, which is n³/3. But the sum is actually larger than the integral. The integral from 0 to n of t² dt = n³/3, and the sum from k=1 to n of k² is ~n³/3 + n²/2 + n/6. So the leading term is n³/3. So when we multiply by x³, and since n = [1/x] ≈1/x, the leading term is (1/x)³/3 *x³ =1/3, which matches our previous result. The next term would be n²/2 ~ (1/x²)/2 *x³ =x/2, which tends to 0. So this also suggests that the limit is 1/3.

Therefore, multiple approaches confirm that the limit is 1/3.

To find the limit \(\lim \limits_{x \to 0} \ x^3\Big(1+2^2+3^2+\ldots+\Big[\frac{1}{\vert x \vert}\Big]^2\Big)\), we start by noting that as \(x \to 0\), \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) becomes very large. Let \(n = \left[\frac{1}{|x|}\right]\), which is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{|x|}\). The sum of squares from 1 to \(n\) is given by the formula:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\]

Substituting \(n \approx \frac{1}{|x|}\) (since \(n\) is the integer part of \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) and the difference becomes negligible as \(x \to 0\)), we approximate the sum:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right)\left(\frac{1}{|x|} + 1\right)\left(2\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right) + 1\right)}{6}
\]

Expanding and simplifying the terms, we get:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{1}{|x|^3} \cdot \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|^2} \cdot \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|} \cdot \frac{1}{6}
\]

Multiplying this sum by \(x^3\) and considering the leading terms as \(x \to 0\):

\[
x^3 \left( \frac{2}{6|x|^3} + \frac{3}{6|x|^2} + \frac{1}{6|x|} \right) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{6}
\]

As \(x \to 0\), the terms \(\frac{x}{2}\) and \(\frac{x^2}{6}\) approach 0, leaving the limit as:

\[

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limit as x approaches 0 of x cubed multiplied by the sum of squares from 1 up to [1/|x|], where [.] is the greatest integer function. Hmm, let me start by understanding what this sum looks like.

First, when x approaches 0, 1/|x| becomes very large. So, [1/|x|] is the integer part of 1/|x|. Let&#x27;s denote n = [1/|x|]. Then, the sum in question is 1² + 2² + 3² + ... + n². I remember there&#x27;s a formula for the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers. Let me recall it. I think it&#x27;s n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Let me verify that. For example, if n=1, sum is 1, formula gives 1*2*3/6=6/6=1. If n=2, sum is 1+4=5, formula gives 2*3*5/6=30/6=5. Yeah, that seems right. So the sum is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6.

So substituting back, the expression becomes x³ * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6], where n = [1/|x|]. Since x is approaching 0, n is a large integer. So maybe I can approximate n as approximately 1/|x|, since [1/|x|] is the integer part, but as x approaches 0, the difference between 1/|x| and [1/|x|] becomes negligible. Is that right? Let&#x27;s see. For example, if x is approaching 0 from the positive side, then |x| = x, and [1/x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 1/x. So 1/x - 1 &lt; [1/x] ≤ 1/x. Therefore, as x approaches 0, 1/x becomes very large, and [1/x] ≈ 1/x with an error of less than 1. So maybe we can replace n with 1/|x| in the formula, but we need to be careful with the error terms.

So substituting n ≈ 1/|x|, then the sum becomes approximately (1/|x|)(1/|x| + 1)(2*(1/|x|) + 1)/6. Let me write this out:

Sum ≈ (1/|x|) * (1/|x| + 1) * (2/|x| + 1)/6

Multiply these terms out:

First, multiply (1/|x| + 1) and (2/|x| + 1):

(1/|x|)(2/|x|) + (1/|x|)(1) + 1*(2/|x|) + 1*1

= 2/|x|² + 1/|x| + 2/|x| + 1

= 2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1

Then multiply by (1/|x|)/6:

(1/|x|)/6 * (2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1) = (2/|x|³ + 3/|x|² + 1/|x|)/6

So the sum is approximately (2/(6|x|³) + 3/(6|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)) = (1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|))

Now, the original expression is x³ times this sum:

x³ * [1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)]

Since x is approaching 0, let&#x27;s consider x approaching 0 from the positive side first, so |x| = x. Then, we can write:

x³ * [1/(3x³) + 1/(2x²) + 1/(6x)] = x³*(1/(3x³)) + x³*(1/(2x²)) + x³*(1/(6x))

Simplify each term:

First term: x³/(3x³) = 1/3

Second term: x³/(2x²) = x/2

Third term: x³/(6x) = x²/6

As x approaches 0, the second and third terms approach 0, so the entire expression approaches 1/3.

But wait, is this correct? Because we approximated n as 1/x, but actually n = [1/x], which is 1/x minus a fractional part less than 1. So n = 1/x - {1/x}, where {1/x} is the fractional part. Therefore, n = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. So when we plug n into the sum formula, maybe we need to consider the effect of δ?

Hmm, let&#x27;s analyze that. Let me write n = [1/x] = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. Then, the sum is:

Sum = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 = (1/x - δ)(1/x - δ + 1)(2(1/x - δ) + 1)/6

This looks complicated. Let&#x27;s expand this expression step by step.

First, compute each bracket:

First term: (1/x - δ)

Second term: (1/x - δ + 1) = (1/x + 1 - δ)

Third term: 2(1/x - δ) + 1 = 2/x - 2δ + 1

Multiply all three terms:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ)(2/x + 1 - 2δ)

This seems messy, but maybe we can expand this in terms of 1/x. Since δ is between 0 and 1, and x is approaching 0, 1/x is large, so terms with higher powers of 1/x will dominate.

Let me expand the first two factors first:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ) = (1/x)(1/x + 1 - δ) - δ(1/x + 1 - δ)

= (1/x² + (1 - δ)/x) - (δ/x + δ(1 - δ))

= 1/x² + (1 - δ)/x - δ/x - δ(1 - δ)

Simplify:

1/x² + [ (1 - δ) - δ ] /x - δ(1 - δ)

= 1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²

Now multiply this by the third factor (2/x + 1 - 2δ):

[1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²] * [2/x + 1 - 2δ]

Let&#x27;s multiply term by term:

First term: 1/x² * 2/x = 2/x³

Second term: 1/x² * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)/x²

Third term: (1 - 2δ)/x * 2/x = 2(1 - 2δ)/x²

Fourth term: (1 - 2δ)/x * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)^2 /x

Fifth term: (-δ + δ²) * 2/x = (-2δ + 2δ²)/x

Sixth term: (-δ + δ²) * (1 - 2δ) = -δ(1 - 2δ) + δ²(1 - 2δ) = -δ + 2δ² + δ² - 2δ³ = -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So combining all terms:

2/x³ + (1 - 2δ)/x² + 2(1 - 2δ)/x² + (1 - 2δ)^2 /x + (-2δ + 2δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Combine like terms:

For 1/x³: 2/x³

For 1/x²: [ (1 - 2δ) + 2(1 - 2δ) ] /x² = [1 - 2δ + 2 - 4δ]/x² = (3 - 6δ)/x²

For 1/x: [ (1 - 2δ)^2 + (-2δ + 2δ²) ] /x

Let me compute (1 - 2δ)^2:

= 1 - 4δ + 4δ²

So adding (-2δ + 2δ²):

1 - 4δ + 4δ² -2δ + 2δ² = 1 - 6δ + 6δ²

Therefore, the 1/x term is (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x

Constant term: -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So overall, the product is:

2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Therefore, the sum is:

[2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)] /6

So when we multiply this by x³, the original expression becomes:

x³ * Sum ≈ x³ * [2/(6x³) + (3 - 6δ)/(6x²) + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6]

Simplify each term:

First term: x³*(2)/(6x³) = 2/6 = 1/3

Second term: x³*(3 - 6δ)/(6x²) = (3 - 6δ)x/(6) = (1 - 2δ)x/2

Third term: x³*(1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) = (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)x²/6

Fourth term: x³*(-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6 = (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)x³/6

Now, as x approaches 0, δ is between 0 and 1. So δ is bounded. Therefore, the second term is O(x), the third term is O(x²), and the fourth term is O(x³). All of these go to 0 as x approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is determined by the first term, which is 1/3. So the limit is 1/3?

But wait, but δ is dependent on x. Since δ = 1/x - n, where n is [1/x], so δ = {1/x}, the fractional part of 1/x. So as x approaches 0, 1/x can be written as integer plus fractional part. So δ is between 0 and 1. However, as x approaches 0, depending on the sequence of x&#x27;s approaching 0, δ can oscillate between 0 and 1. For example, if x approaches 0 through 1/n for integer n, then δ = 0. If x approaches 0 through 1/(n + 0.5), then δ = 0.5. So δ can vary. However, in our calculation above, the only term that could possibly depend on δ is the second term (1 - 2δ)x/2, but even though δ varies between 0 and 1, as x approaches 0, (1 - 2δ) is bounded (since δ is between 0 and1, 1 - 2δ is between -1 and1), so (1 - 2δ)x/2 approaches 0 as x approaches 0 regardless of δ. Similarly, the other terms also vanish. Therefore, regardless of the value of δ, the limit is 1/3. So maybe the answer is 1/3.

But let me check with specific sequences. Suppose x approaches 0 through the sequence x_n = 1/n, where n is a positive integer. Then [1/x] = [n] = n. Then the sum is 1² + 2² + ... + n² = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Multiply by x³ = (1/n³):

So expression is (1/n³) * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6] = [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n³) = [(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n²)

Expand numerator: (n + 1)(2n +1) = 2n² + 3n +1

Therefore, expression is (2n² + 3n +1)/(6n²) = (2 + 3/n + 1/n²)/6

As n approaches infinity, this approaches (2 + 0 +0)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3. So that&#x27;s consistent.

Now, take another sequence where x approaches 0 through x = 1/(n + 0.5), where n is integer. Then [1/x] = [n + 0.5] = n. So sum is still up to n, same as before. Then x = 1/(n + 0.5), so x³ = 1/(n + 0.5)^3, and the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + 0.5)^3.

Let me compute this as n approaches infinity. Let&#x27;s write n + 0.5 as n(1 + 0.5/n). Then denominator is (n(1 + 0.5/n))³ = n³(1 + 0.5/n)^3 ≈ n³(1 + 1.5/n + ...) by binomial expansion.

Numerator: n(n +1)(2n +1) ≈ n*(n)(2n) = 2n³. So numerator ≈2n³, denominator≈6n³. Therefore, expression ≈2n³/(6n³) = 1/3. The higher order terms would be lower order in n, so as n approaches infinity, the expression still approaches 1/3. So regardless of how x approaches 0, the limit seems to be 1/3.

But let me test with x approaching 0 through some irrational sequence. For example, x = 1/(n + sqrt(2)), but here [1/x] would still be n, as 1/x = n + sqrt(2), so [1/x] = n. So similar to the previous case, the sum would be up to n, and x³ = 1/(n + sqrt(2))³. Then the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + sqrt(2))³. As n approaches infinity, the same reasoning applies: numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so limit 1/3.

Therefore, seems like regardless of the approach path, the limit is 1/3.

But let me check with another example where x approaches 0 in a different way, say x = 1/(n + ε), where ε is a fixed between 0 and1. For instance, ε=0.1. Then [1/x] = n, sum is up to n, x³ =1/(n +0.1)^3. Then expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n +0.1)^3. Again, as n→∞, numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so expression ~1/3.

Alternatively, take x approaching 0 through x=1/(n - 0.1). Then [1/x] = [n -0.1] = n -1. Wait, but 1/x =n -0.1, so [1/x] = n -1. Then sum is up to n -1. So expression is [(n -1)n(2n -1)/6]/(n -0.1)^3. Let&#x27;s compute this:

Numerator: (n -1)n(2n -1) ≈ (n² -n)(2n -1) ≈2n³ -n² -2n² +n ≈2n³ -3n² +n ~2n³

Denominator:6(n -0.1)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.1/n)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.3/n + ...) ~6n³

Thus, the expression ~2n³/(6n³)=1/3. So still converges to 1/3.

Therefore, regardless of how x approaches 0, as long as we take the limit, the expression tends to 1/3.

But wait, in the initial approximation, we neglected the δ term, assuming that n ≈1/x. But even when we considered δ, the correction terms ended up vanishing in the limit. Therefore, the limit is indeed 1/3.

But the sum is actually larger than the integral. The integral from 0 to n of t² dt = n³/3, and the sum from k=1 to n of k² is ~n³/3 + n²/2 + n/6. So the leading term is n³/3. So when we multiply by x³, and since n = [1/x] ≈1/x, the leading term is (1/x)³/3 *x³ =1/3, which matches our previous result. The next term would be n²/2 ~ (1/x²)/2 *x³ =x/2, which tends to 0. So this also suggests that the limit is 1/3.

Therefore, multiple approaches confirm that the limit is 1/3.

\[

\]

Substituting \(n \approx \frac{1}{|x|}\) (since \(n\) is the integer part of \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) and the difference becomes negligible as \(x \to 0\)), we approximate the sum:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right)\left(\frac{1}{|x|} + 1\right)\left(2\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right) + 1\right)}{6}
\]

Expanding and simplifying the terms, we get:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{1}{|x|^3} \cdot \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|^2} \cdot \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|} \cdot \frac{1}{6}
\]

Multiplying this sum by \(x^3\) and considering the leading terms as \(x \to 0\):

\[
x^3 \left( \frac{2}{6|x|^3} + \frac{3}{6|x|^2} + \frac{1}{6|x|} \right) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{6}
\]

As \(x \to 0\), the terms \(\frac{x}{2}\) and \(\frac{x^2}{6}\) approach 0, leaving the limit as:

For example, if n=1, sum is 1, formula gives 1*2*3/6=6/6=1. If n=2, sum is 1+4=5, formula gives 2*3*5/6=30/6=5. Yeah, that seems right. So the sum is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6.

So substituting back, the expression becomes x³ * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6], where n = [1/|x|]. Since x is approaching 0, n is a large integer. So maybe I can approximate n as approximately 1/|x|, since [1/|x|] is the integer part, but as x approaches 0, the difference between 1/|x| and [1/|x|] becomes negligible. Is that right? Let&#x27;s see. For example, if x is approaching 0 from the positive side, then |x| = x, and [1/x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 1/x. So 1/x - 1 &lt; [1/x] ≤ 1/x. Therefore, as x approaches 0, 1/x becomes very large, and [1/x] ≈ 1/x with an error of less than 1. So maybe we can replace n with 1/|x| in the formula, but we need to be careful with the error terms.

So substituting n ≈ 1/|x|, then the sum becomes approximately (1/|x|)(1/|x| + 1)(2*(1/|x|) + 1)/6. Let me write this out:

Sum ≈ (1/|x|) * (1/|x| + 1) * (2/|x| + 1)/6

Multiply these terms out:

First, multiply (1/|x| + 1) and (2/|x| + 1):

(1/|x|)(2/|x|) + (1/|x|)(1) + 1*(2/|x|) + 1*1

= 2/|x|² + 1/|x| + 2/|x| + 1

= 2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1

Then multiply by (1/|x|)/6:

(1/|x|)/6 * (2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1) = (2/|x|³ + 3/|x|² + 1/|x|)/6

So the sum is approximately (2/(6|x|³) + 3/(6|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)) = (1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|))

Now, the original expression is x³ times this sum:

x³ * [1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)]

Since x is approaching 0, let&#x27;s consider x approaching 0 from the positive side first, so |x| = x. Then, we can write:

x³ * [1/(3x³) + 1/(2x²) + 1/(6x)] = x³*(1/(3x³)) + x³*(1/(2x²)) + x³*(1/(6x))

Simplify each term:

First term: x³/(3x³) = 1/3

Second term: x³/(2x²) = x/2

Third term: x³/(6x) = x²/6

As x approaches 0, the second and third terms approach 0, so the entire expression approaches 1/3.

But wait, is this correct? Because we approximated n as 1/x, but actually n = [1/x], which is 1/x minus a fractional part less than 1. So n = 1/x - {1/x}, where {1/x} is the fractional part. Therefore, n = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. So when we plug n into the sum formula, maybe we need to consider the effect of δ?

Hmm, let&#x27;s analyze that. Let me write n = [1/x] = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. Then, the sum is:

Sum = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 = (1/x - δ)(1/x - δ + 1)(2(1/x - δ) + 1)/6

This looks complicated. Let&#x27;s expand this expression step by step.

First, compute each bracket:

First term: (1/x - δ)

Second term: (1/x - δ + 1) = (1/x + 1 - δ)

Third term: 2(1/x - δ) + 1 = 2/x - 2δ + 1

Multiply all three terms:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ)(2/x + 1 - 2δ)

This seems messy, but maybe we can expand this in terms of 1/x. Since δ is between 0 and 1, and x is approaching 0, 1/x is large, so terms with higher powers of 1/x will dominate.

Let me expand the first two factors first:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ) = (1/x)(1/x + 1 - δ) - δ(1/x + 1 - δ)

= (1/x² + (1 - δ)/x) - (δ/x + δ(1 - δ))

= 1/x² + (1 - δ)/x - δ/x - δ(1 - δ)

Simplify:

1/x² + [ (1 - δ) - δ ] /x - δ(1 - δ)

= 1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²

Now multiply this by the third factor (2/x + 1 - 2δ):

[1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²] * [2/x + 1 - 2δ]

Let&#x27;s multiply term by term:

First term: 1/x² * 2/x = 2/x³

Second term: 1/x² * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)/x²

Third term: (1 - 2δ)/x * 2/x = 2(1 - 2δ)/x²

Fourth term: (1 - 2δ)/x * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)^2 /x

Fifth term: (-δ + δ²) * 2/x = (-2δ + 2δ²)/x

Sixth term: (-δ + δ²) * (1 - 2δ) = -δ(1 - 2δ) + δ²(1 - 2δ) = -δ + 2δ² + δ² - 2δ³ = -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So combining all terms:

2/x³ + (1 - 2δ)/x² + 2(1 - 2δ)/x² + (1 - 2δ)^2 /x + (-2δ + 2δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Combine like terms:

For 1/x³: 2/x³

For 1/x²: [ (1 - 2δ) + 2(1 - 2δ) ] /x² = [1 - 2δ + 2 - 4δ]/x² = (3 - 6δ)/x²

For 1/x: [ (1 - 2δ)^2 + (-2δ + 2δ²) ] /x

Let me compute (1 - 2δ)^2:

= 1 - 4δ + 4δ²

So adding (-2δ + 2δ²):

1 - 4δ + 4δ² -2δ + 2δ² = 1 - 6δ + 6δ²

Therefore, the 1/x term is (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x

Constant term: -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So overall, the product is:

2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Therefore, the sum is:

[2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)] /6

So when we multiply this by x³, the original expression becomes:

x³ * Sum ≈ x³ * [2/(6x³) + (3 - 6δ)/(6x²) + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6]

Simplify each term:

First term: x³*(2)/(6x³) = 2/6 = 1/3

Second term: x³*(3 - 6δ)/(6x²) = (3 - 6δ)x/(6) = (1 - 2δ)x/2

Third term: x³*(1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) = (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)x²/6

Fourth term: x³*(-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6 = (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)x³/6

Now, as x approaches 0, δ is between 0 and 1. So δ is bounded. Therefore, the second term is O(x), the third term is O(x²), and the fourth term is O(x³). All of these go to 0 as x approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is determined by the first term, which is 1/3. So the limit is 1/3?

But wait, but δ is dependent on x. Since δ = 1/x - n, where n is [1/x], so δ = {1/x}, the fractional part of 1/x. So as x approaches 0, 1/x can be written as integer plus fractional part. So δ is between 0 and 1. However, as x approaches 0, depending on the sequence of x&#x27;s approaching 0, δ can oscillate between 0 and 1. For example, if x approaches 0 through 1/n for integer n, then δ = 0. If x approaches 0 through 1/(n + 0.5), then δ = 0.5. So δ can vary. However, in our calculation above, the only term that could possibly depend on δ is the second term (1 - 2δ)x/2, but even though δ varies between 0 and 1, as x approaches 0, (1 - 2δ) is bounded (since δ is between 0 and1, 1 - 2δ is between -1 and1), so (1 - 2δ)x/2 approaches 0 as x approaches 0 regardless of δ. Similarly, the other terms also vanish. Therefore, regardless of the value of δ, the limit is 1/3. So maybe the answer is 1/3.

But let me check with specific sequences. Suppose x approaches 0 through the sequence x_n = 1/n, where n is a positive integer. Then [1/x] = [n] = n. Then the sum is 1² + 2² + ... + n² = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Multiply by x³ = (1/n³):

So expression is (1/n³) * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6] = [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n³) = [(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n²)

Expand numerator: (n + 1)(2n +1) = 2n² + 3n +1

Therefore, expression is (2n² + 3n +1)/(6n²) = (2 + 3/n + 1/n²)/6

As n approaches infinity, this approaches (2 + 0 +0)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3. So that&#x27;s consistent.

Now, take another sequence where x approaches 0 through x = 1/(n + 0.5), where n is integer. Then [1/x] = [n + 0.5] = n. So sum is still up to n, same as before. Then x = 1/(n + 0.5), so x³ = 1/(n + 0.5)^3, and the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + 0.5)^3.

Let me compute this as n approaches infinity. Let&#x27;s write n + 0.5 as n(1 + 0.5/n). Then denominator is (n(1 + 0.5/n))³ = n³(1 + 0.5/n)^3 ≈ n³(1 + 1.5/n + ...) by binomial expansion.

Numerator: n(n +1)(2n +1) ≈ n*(n)(2n) = 2n³. So numerator ≈2n³, denominator≈6n³. Therefore, expression ≈2n³/(6n³) = 1/3. The higher order terms would be lower order in n, so as n approaches infinity, the expression still approaches 1/3. So regardless of how x approaches 0, the limit seems to be 1/3.

But let me test with x approaching 0 through some irrational sequence. For example, x = 1/(n + sqrt(2)), but here [1/x] would still be n, as 1/x = n + sqrt(2), so [1/x] = n. So similar to the previous case, the sum would be up to n, and x³ = 1/(n + sqrt(2))³. Then the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + sqrt(2))³. As n approaches infinity, the same reasoning applies: numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so limit 1/3.

Therefore, seems like regardless of the approach path, the limit is 1/3.

But let me check with another example where x approaches 0 in a different way, say x = 1/(n + ε), where ε is a fixed between 0 and1. For instance, ε=0.1. Then [1/x] = n, sum is up to n, x³ =1/(n +0.1)^3. Then expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n +0.1)^3. Again, as n→∞, numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so expression ~1/3.

Alternatively, take x approaching 0 through x=1/(n - 0.1). Then [1/x] = [n -0.1] = n -1. Wait, but 1/x =n -0.1, so [1/x] = n -1. Then sum is up to n -1. So expression is [(n -1)n(2n -1)/6]/(n -0.1)^3. Let&#x27;s compute this:

Numerator: (n -1)n(2n -1) ≈ (n² -n)(2n -1) ≈2n³ -n² -2n² +n ≈2n³ -3n² +n ~2n³

Denominator:6(n -0.1)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.1/n)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.3/n + ...) ~6n³

Thus, the expression ~2n³/(6n³)=1/3. So still converges to 1/3.

Therefore, regardless of how x approaches 0, as long as we take the limit, the expression tends to 1/3.

But wait, in the initial approximation, we neglected the δ term, assuming that n ≈1/x. But even when we considered δ, the correction terms ended up vanishing in the limit. Therefore, the limit is indeed 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use integral approximation for the sum. The sum from k=1 to n of k² is approximately the integral from 0 to n of t² dt, which is n³/3. But the sum is actually larger than the integral. The integral from 0 to n of t² dt = n³/3, and the sum from k=1 to n of k² is ~n³/3 + n²/2 + n/6. So the leading term is n³/3. So when we multiply by x³, and since n = [1/x] ≈1/x, the leading term is (1/x)³/3 *x³ =1/3, which matches our previous result. The next term would be n²/2 ~ (1/x²)/2 *x³ =x/2, which tends to 0. So this also suggests that the limit is 1/3.

Therefore, multiple approaches confirm that the limit is 1/3.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the limit \(\lim \limits_{x \to 0} \ x^3\Big(1+2^2+3^2+\ldots+\Big[\frac{1}{\vert x \vert}\Big]^2\Big)\), we start by noting that as \(x \to 0\), \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) becomes very large. Let \(n = \left[\frac{1}{|x|}\right]\), which is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{|x|}\). The sum of squares from 1 to \(n\) is given by the formula:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\]

Substituting \(n \approx \frac{1}{|x|}\) (since \(n\) is the integer part of \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) and the difference becomes negligible as \(x \to 0\)), we approximate the sum:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right)\left(\frac{1}{|x|} + 1\right)\left(2\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right) + 1\right)}{6}
\]

Expanding and simplifying the terms, we get:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{1}{|x|^3} \cdot \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|^2} \cdot \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|} \cdot \frac{1}{6}
\]

Multiplying this sum by \(x^3\) and considering the leading terms as \(x \to 0\):

\[
x^3 \left( \frac{2}{6|x|^3} + \frac{3}{6|x|^2} + \frac{1}{6|x|} \right) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{6}
\]

As \(x \to 0\), the terms \(\frac{x}{2}\) and \(\frac{x^2}{6}\) approach 0, leaving the limit as:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limit as x approaches 0 of x cubed multiplied by the sum of squares from 1 up to [1/|x|], where [.] is the greatest integer function. Hmm, let me start by understanding what this sum looks like.

First, when x approaches 0, 1/|x| becomes very large. So, [1/|x|] is the integer part of 1/|x|. Let&#x27;s denote n = [1/|x|]. Then, the sum in question is 1² + 2² + 3² + ... + n². I remember there&#x27;s a formula for the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers. Let me recall it. I think it&#x27;s n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Let me verify that. For example, if n=1, sum is 1, formula gives 1*2*3/6=6/6=1. If n=2, sum is 1+4=5, formula gives 2*3*5/6=30/6=5. Yeah, that seems right. So the sum is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6.

So substituting back, the expression becomes x³ * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6], where n = [1/|x|]. Since x is approaching 0, n is a large integer. So maybe I can approximate n as approximately 1/|x|, since [1/|x|] is the integer part, but as x approaches 0, the difference between 1/|x| and [1/|x|] becomes negligible. Is that right? Let&#x27;s see. For example, if x is approaching 0 from the positive side, then |x| = x, and [1/x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 1/x. So 1/x - 1 &lt; [1/x] ≤ 1/x. Therefore, as x approaches 0, 1/x becomes very large, and [1/x] ≈ 1/x with an error of less than 1. So maybe we can replace n with 1/|x| in the formula, but we need to be careful with the error terms.

So substituting n ≈ 1/|x|, then the sum becomes approximately (1/|x|)(1/|x| + 1)(2*(1/|x|) + 1)/6. Let me write this out:

Sum ≈ (1/|x|) * (1/|x| + 1) * (2/|x| + 1)/6

Multiply these terms out:

First, multiply (1/|x| + 1) and (2/|x| + 1):

(1/|x|)(2/|x|) + (1/|x|)(1) + 1*(2/|x|) + 1*1

= 2/|x|² + 1/|x| + 2/|x| + 1

= 2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1

Then multiply by (1/|x|)/6:

(1/|x|)/6 * (2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1) = (2/|x|³ + 3/|x|² + 1/|x|)/6

So the sum is approximately (2/(6|x|³) + 3/(6|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)) = (1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|))

Now, the original expression is x³ times this sum:

x³ * [1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)]

Since x is approaching 0, let&#x27;s consider x approaching 0 from the positive side first, so |x| = x. Then, we can write:

x³ * [1/(3x³) + 1/(2x²) + 1/(6x)] = x³*(1/(3x³)) + x³*(1/(2x²)) + x³*(1/(6x))

Simplify each term:

First term: x³/(3x³) = 1/3

Second term: x³/(2x²) = x/2

Third term: x³/(6x) = x²/6

As x approaches 0, the second and third terms approach 0, so the entire expression approaches 1/3.

But wait, is this correct? Because we approximated n as 1/x, but actually n = [1/x], which is 1/x minus a fractional part less than 1. So n = 1/x - {1/x}, where {1/x} is the fractional part. Therefore, n = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. So when we plug n into the sum formula, maybe we need to consider the effect of δ?

Hmm, let&#x27;s analyze that. Let me write n = [1/x] = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. Then, the sum is:

Sum = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 = (1/x - δ)(1/x - δ + 1)(2(1/x - δ) + 1)/6

This looks complicated. Let&#x27;s expand this expression step by step.

First, compute each bracket:

First term: (1/x - δ)

Second term: (1/x - δ + 1) = (1/x + 1 - δ)

Third term: 2(1/x - δ) + 1 = 2/x - 2δ + 1

Multiply all three terms:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ)(2/x + 1 - 2δ)

This seems messy, but maybe we can expand this in terms of 1/x. Since δ is between 0 and 1, and x is approaching 0, 1/x is large, so terms with higher powers of 1/x will dominate.

Let me expand the first two factors first:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ) = (1/x)(1/x + 1 - δ) - δ(1/x + 1 - δ)

= (1/x² + (1 - δ)/x) - (δ/x + δ(1 - δ))

= 1/x² + (1 - δ)/x - δ/x - δ(1 - δ)

Simplify:

1/x² + [ (1 - δ) - δ ] /x - δ(1 - δ)

= 1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²

Now multiply this by the third factor (2/x + 1 - 2δ):

[1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²] * [2/x + 1 - 2δ]

Let&#x27;s multiply term by term:

First term: 1/x² * 2/x = 2/x³

Second term: 1/x² * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)/x²

Third term: (1 - 2δ)/x * 2/x = 2(1 - 2δ)/x²

Fourth term: (1 - 2δ)/x * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)^2 /x

Fifth term: (-δ + δ²) * 2/x = (-2δ + 2δ²)/x

Sixth term: (-δ + δ²) * (1 - 2δ) = -δ(1 - 2δ) + δ²(1 - 2δ) = -δ + 2δ² + δ² - 2δ³ = -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So combining all terms:

2/x³ + (1 - 2δ)/x² + 2(1 - 2δ)/x² + (1 - 2δ)^2 /x + (-2δ + 2δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Combine like terms:

For 1/x³: 2/x³

For 1/x²: [ (1 - 2δ) + 2(1 - 2δ) ] /x² = [1 - 2δ + 2 - 4δ]/x² = (3 - 6δ)/x²

For 1/x: [ (1 - 2δ)^2 + (-2δ + 2δ²) ] /x

Let me compute (1 - 2δ)^2:

= 1 - 4δ + 4δ²

So adding (-2δ + 2δ²):

1 - 4δ + 4δ² -2δ + 2δ² = 1 - 6δ + 6δ²

Therefore, the 1/x term is (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x

Constant term: -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So overall, the product is:

2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Therefore, the sum is:

[2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)] /6

So when we multiply this by x³, the original expression becomes:

x³ * Sum ≈ x³ * [2/(6x³) + (3 - 6δ)/(6x²) + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6]

Simplify each term:

First term: x³*(2)/(6x³) = 2/6 = 1/3

Second term: x³*(3 - 6δ)/(6x²) = (3 - 6δ)x/(6) = (1 - 2δ)x/2

Third term: x³*(1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) = (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)x²/6

Fourth term: x³*(-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6 = (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)x³/6

Now, as x approaches 0, δ is between 0 and 1. So δ is bounded. Therefore, the second term is O(x), the third term is O(x²), and the fourth term is O(x³). All of these go to 0 as x approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is determined by the first term, which is 1/3. So the limit is 1/3?

But wait, but δ is dependent on x. Since δ = 1/x - n, where n is [1/x], so δ = {1/x}, the fractional part of 1/x. So as x approaches 0, 1/x can be written as integer plus fractional part. So δ is between 0 and 1. However, as x approaches 0, depending on the sequence of x&#x27;s approaching 0, δ can oscillate between 0 and 1. For example, if x approaches 0 through 1/n for integer n, then δ = 0. If x approaches 0 through 1/(n + 0.5), then δ = 0.5. So δ can vary. However, in our calculation above, the only term that could possibly depend on δ is the second term (1 - 2δ)x/2, but even though δ varies between 0 and 1, as x approaches 0, (1 - 2δ) is bounded (since δ is between 0 and1, 1 - 2δ is between -1 and1), so (1 - 2δ)x/2 approaches 0 as x approaches 0 regardless of δ. Similarly, the other terms also vanish. Therefore, regardless of the value of δ, the limit is 1/3. So maybe the answer is 1/3.

But let me check with specific sequences. Suppose x approaches 0 through the sequence x_n = 1/n, where n is a positive integer. Then [1/x] = [n] = n. Then the sum is 1² + 2² + ... + n² = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Multiply by x³ = (1/n³):

So expression is (1/n³) * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6] = [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n³) = [(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n²)

Expand numerator: (n + 1)(2n +1) = 2n² + 3n +1

Therefore, expression is (2n² + 3n +1)/(6n²) = (2 + 3/n + 1/n²)/6

As n approaches infinity, this approaches (2 + 0 +0)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3. So that&#x27;s consistent.

Now, take another sequence where x approaches 0 through x = 1/(n + 0.5), where n is integer. Then [1/x] = [n + 0.5] = n. So sum is still up to n, same as before. Then x = 1/(n + 0.5), so x³ = 1/(n + 0.5)^3, and the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + 0.5)^3.

Let me compute this as n approaches infinity. Let&#x27;s write n + 0.5 as n(1 + 0.5/n). Then denominator is (n(1 + 0.5/n))³ = n³(1 + 0.5/n)^3 ≈ n³(1 + 1.5/n + ...) by binomial expansion.

Numerator: n(n +1)(2n +1) ≈ n*(n)(2n) = 2n³. So numerator ≈2n³, denominator≈6n³. Therefore, expression ≈2n³/(6n³) = 1/3. The higher order terms would be lower order in n, so as n approaches infinity, the expression still approaches 1/3. So regardless of how x approaches 0, the limit seems to be 1/3.

But let me test with x approaching 0 through some irrational sequence. For example, x = 1/(n + sqrt(2)), but here [1/x] would still be n, as 1/x = n + sqrt(2), so [1/x] = n. So similar to the previous case, the sum would be up to n, and x³ = 1/(n + sqrt(2))³. Then the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + sqrt(2))³. As n approaches infinity, the same reasoning applies: numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so limit 1/3.

Therefore, seems like regardless of the approach path, the limit is 1/3.

But let me check with another example where x approaches 0 in a different way, say x = 1/(n + ε), where ε is a fixed between 0 and1. For instance, ε=0.1. Then [1/x] = n, sum is up to n, x³ =1/(n +0.1)^3. Then expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n +0.1)^3. Again, as n→∞, numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so expression ~1/3.

Alternatively, take x approaching 0 through x=1/(n - 0.1). Then [1/x] = [n -0.1] = n -1. Wait, but 1/x =n -0.1, so [1/x] = n -1. Then sum is up to n -1. So expression is [(n -1)n(2n -1)/6]/(n -0.1)^3. Let&#x27;s compute this:

Numerator: (n -1)n(2n -1) ≈ (n² -n)(2n -1) ≈2n³ -n² -2n² +n ≈2n³ -3n² +n ~2n³

Denominator:6(n -0.1)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.1/n)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.3/n + ...) ~6n³

Thus, the expression ~2n³/(6n³)=1/3. So still converges to 1/3.

Therefore, regardless of how x approaches 0, as long as we take the limit, the expression tends to 1/3.

But wait, in the initial approximation, we neglected the δ term, assuming that n ≈1/x. But even when we considered δ, the correction terms ended up vanishing in the limit. Therefore, the limit is indeed 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use integral approximation for the sum. The sum from k=1 to n of k² is approximately the integral from 0 to n of t² dt, which is n³/3. But the sum is actually larger than the integral. The integral from 0 to n of t² dt = n³/3, and the sum from k=1 to n of k² is ~n³/3 + n²/2 + n/6. So the leading term is n³/3. So when we multiply by x³, and since n = [1/x] ≈1/x, the leading term is (1/x)³/3 *x³ =1/3, which matches our previous result. The next term would be n²/2 ~ (1/x²)/2 *x³ =x/2, which tends to 0. So this also suggests that the limit is 1/3.

Therefore, multiple approaches confirm that the limit is 1/3.

To find the limit \(\lim \limits_{x \to 0} \ x^3\Big(1+2^2+3^2+\ldots+\Big[\frac{1}{\vert x \vert}\Big]^2\Big)\), we start by noting that as \(x \to 0\), \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) becomes very large. Let \(n = \left[\frac{1}{|x|}\right]\), which is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{|x|}\). The sum of squares from 1 to \(n\) is given by the formula:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\]

Substituting \(n \approx \frac{1}{|x|}\) (since \(n\) is the integer part of \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) and the difference becomes negligible as \(x \to 0\)), we approximate the sum:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right)\left(\frac{1}{|x|} + 1\right)\left(2\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right) + 1\right)}{6}
\]

Expanding and simplifying the terms, we get:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{1}{|x|^3} \cdot \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|^2} \cdot \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|} \cdot \frac{1}{6}
\]

Multiplying this sum by \(x^3\) and considering the leading terms as \(x \to 0\):

\[
x^3 \left( \frac{2}{6|x|^3} + \frac{3}{6|x|^2} + \frac{1}{6|x|} \right) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{6}
\]

As \(x \to 0\), the terms \(\frac{x}{2}\) and \(\frac{x^2}{6}\) approach 0, leaving the limit as:

\[

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limit as x approaches 0 of x cubed multiplied by the sum of squares from 1 up to [1/|x|], where [.] is the greatest integer function. Hmm, let me start by understanding what this sum looks like.

First, when x approaches 0, 1/|x| becomes very large. So, [1/|x|] is the integer part of 1/|x|. Let&#x27;s denote n = [1/|x|]. Then, the sum in question is 1² + 2² + 3² + ... + n². I remember there&#x27;s a formula for the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers. Let me recall it. I think it&#x27;s n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Let me verify that. For example, if n=1, sum is 1, formula gives 1*2*3/6=6/6=1. If n=2, sum is 1+4=5, formula gives 2*3*5/6=30/6=5. Yeah, that seems right. So the sum is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6.

So substituting back, the expression becomes x³ * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6], where n = [1/|x|]. Since x is approaching 0, n is a large integer. So maybe I can approximate n as approximately 1/|x|, since [1/|x|] is the integer part, but as x approaches 0, the difference between 1/|x| and [1/|x|] becomes negligible. Is that right? Let&#x27;s see. For example, if x is approaching 0 from the positive side, then |x| = x, and [1/x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 1/x. So 1/x - 1 &lt; [1/x] ≤ 1/x. Therefore, as x approaches 0, 1/x becomes very large, and [1/x] ≈ 1/x with an error of less than 1. So maybe we can replace n with 1/|x| in the formula, but we need to be careful with the error terms.

So substituting n ≈ 1/|x|, then the sum becomes approximately (1/|x|)(1/|x| + 1)(2*(1/|x|) + 1)/6. Let me write this out:

Sum ≈ (1/|x|) * (1/|x| + 1) * (2/|x| + 1)/6

Multiply these terms out:

First, multiply (1/|x| + 1) and (2/|x| + 1):

(1/|x|)(2/|x|) + (1/|x|)(1) + 1*(2/|x|) + 1*1

= 2/|x|² + 1/|x| + 2/|x| + 1

= 2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1

Then multiply by (1/|x|)/6:

(1/|x|)/6 * (2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1) = (2/|x|³ + 3/|x|² + 1/|x|)/6

So the sum is approximately (2/(6|x|³) + 3/(6|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)) = (1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|))

Now, the original expression is x³ times this sum:

x³ * [1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)]

Since x is approaching 0, let&#x27;s consider x approaching 0 from the positive side first, so |x| = x. Then, we can write:

x³ * [1/(3x³) + 1/(2x²) + 1/(6x)] = x³*(1/(3x³)) + x³*(1/(2x²)) + x³*(1/(6x))

Simplify each term:

First term: x³/(3x³) = 1/3

Second term: x³/(2x²) = x/2

Third term: x³/(6x) = x²/6

As x approaches 0, the second and third terms approach 0, so the entire expression approaches 1/3.

But wait, is this correct? Because we approximated n as 1/x, but actually n = [1/x], which is 1/x minus a fractional part less than 1. So n = 1/x - {1/x}, where {1/x} is the fractional part. Therefore, n = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. So when we plug n into the sum formula, maybe we need to consider the effect of δ?

Hmm, let&#x27;s analyze that. Let me write n = [1/x] = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. Then, the sum is:

Sum = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 = (1/x - δ)(1/x - δ + 1)(2(1/x - δ) + 1)/6

This looks complicated. Let&#x27;s expand this expression step by step.

First, compute each bracket:

First term: (1/x - δ)

Second term: (1/x - δ + 1) = (1/x + 1 - δ)

Third term: 2(1/x - δ) + 1 = 2/x - 2δ + 1

Multiply all three terms:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ)(2/x + 1 - 2δ)

This seems messy, but maybe we can expand this in terms of 1/x. Since δ is between 0 and 1, and x is approaching 0, 1/x is large, so terms with higher powers of 1/x will dominate.

Let me expand the first two factors first:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ) = (1/x)(1/x + 1 - δ) - δ(1/x + 1 - δ)

= (1/x² + (1 - δ)/x) - (δ/x + δ(1 - δ))

= 1/x² + (1 - δ)/x - δ/x - δ(1 - δ)

Simplify:

1/x² + [ (1 - δ) - δ ] /x - δ(1 - δ)

= 1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²

Now multiply this by the third factor (2/x + 1 - 2δ):

[1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²] * [2/x + 1 - 2δ]

Let&#x27;s multiply term by term:

First term: 1/x² * 2/x = 2/x³

Second term: 1/x² * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)/x²

Third term: (1 - 2δ)/x * 2/x = 2(1 - 2δ)/x²

Fourth term: (1 - 2δ)/x * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)^2 /x

Fifth term: (-δ + δ²) * 2/x = (-2δ + 2δ²)/x

Sixth term: (-δ + δ²) * (1 - 2δ) = -δ(1 - 2δ) + δ²(1 - 2δ) = -δ + 2δ² + δ² - 2δ³ = -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So combining all terms:

2/x³ + (1 - 2δ)/x² + 2(1 - 2δ)/x² + (1 - 2δ)^2 /x + (-2δ + 2δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Combine like terms:

For 1/x³: 2/x³

For 1/x²: [ (1 - 2δ) + 2(1 - 2δ) ] /x² = [1 - 2δ + 2 - 4δ]/x² = (3 - 6δ)/x²

For 1/x: [ (1 - 2δ)^2 + (-2δ + 2δ²) ] /x

Let me compute (1 - 2δ)^2:

= 1 - 4δ + 4δ²

So adding (-2δ + 2δ²):

1 - 4δ + 4δ² -2δ + 2δ² = 1 - 6δ + 6δ²

Therefore, the 1/x term is (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x

Constant term: -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So overall, the product is:

2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Therefore, the sum is:

[2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)] /6

So when we multiply this by x³, the original expression becomes:

x³ * Sum ≈ x³ * [2/(6x³) + (3 - 6δ)/(6x²) + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6]

Simplify each term:

First term: x³*(2)/(6x³) = 2/6 = 1/3

Second term: x³*(3 - 6δ)/(6x²) = (3 - 6δ)x/(6) = (1 - 2δ)x/2

Third term: x³*(1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) = (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)x²/6

Fourth term: x³*(-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6 = (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)x³/6

Now, as x approaches 0, δ is between 0 and 1. So δ is bounded. Therefore, the second term is O(x), the third term is O(x²), and the fourth term is O(x³). All of these go to 0 as x approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is determined by the first term, which is 1/3. So the limit is 1/3?

But wait, but δ is dependent on x. Since δ = 1/x - n, where n is [1/x], so δ = {1/x}, the fractional part of 1/x. So as x approaches 0, 1/x can be written as integer plus fractional part. So δ is between 0 and 1. However, as x approaches 0, depending on the sequence of x&#x27;s approaching 0, δ can oscillate between 0 and 1. For example, if x approaches 0 through 1/n for integer n, then δ = 0. If x approaches 0 through 1/(n + 0.5), then δ = 0.5. So δ can vary. However, in our calculation above, the only term that could possibly depend on δ is the second term (1 - 2δ)x/2, but even though δ varies between 0 and 1, as x approaches 0, (1 - 2δ) is bounded (since δ is between 0 and1, 1 - 2δ is between -1 and1), so (1 - 2δ)x/2 approaches 0 as x approaches 0 regardless of δ. Similarly, the other terms also vanish. Therefore, regardless of the value of δ, the limit is 1/3. So maybe the answer is 1/3.

But let me check with specific sequences. Suppose x approaches 0 through the sequence x_n = 1/n, where n is a positive integer. Then [1/x] = [n] = n. Then the sum is 1² + 2² + ... + n² = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Multiply by x³ = (1/n³):

So expression is (1/n³) * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6] = [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n³) = [(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n²)

Expand numerator: (n + 1)(2n +1) = 2n² + 3n +1

Therefore, expression is (2n² + 3n +1)/(6n²) = (2 + 3/n + 1/n²)/6

As n approaches infinity, this approaches (2 + 0 +0)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3. So that&#x27;s consistent.

Now, take another sequence where x approaches 0 through x = 1/(n + 0.5), where n is integer. Then [1/x] = [n + 0.5] = n. So sum is still up to n, same as before. Then x = 1/(n + 0.5), so x³ = 1/(n + 0.5)^3, and the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + 0.5)^3.

Let me compute this as n approaches infinity. Let&#x27;s write n + 0.5 as n(1 + 0.5/n). Then denominator is (n(1 + 0.5/n))³ = n³(1 + 0.5/n)^3 ≈ n³(1 + 1.5/n + ...) by binomial expansion.

Numerator: n(n +1)(2n +1) ≈ n*(n)(2n) = 2n³. So numerator ≈2n³, denominator≈6n³. Therefore, expression ≈2n³/(6n³) = 1/3. The higher order terms would be lower order in n, so as n approaches infinity, the expression still approaches 1/3. So regardless of how x approaches 0, the limit seems to be 1/3.

But let me test with x approaching 0 through some irrational sequence. For example, x = 1/(n + sqrt(2)), but here [1/x] would still be n, as 1/x = n + sqrt(2), so [1/x] = n. So similar to the previous case, the sum would be up to n, and x³ = 1/(n + sqrt(2))³. Then the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + sqrt(2))³. As n approaches infinity, the same reasoning applies: numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so limit 1/3.

Therefore, seems like regardless of the approach path, the limit is 1/3.

But let me check with another example where x approaches 0 in a different way, say x = 1/(n + ε), where ε is a fixed between 0 and1. For instance, ε=0.1. Then [1/x] = n, sum is up to n, x³ =1/(n +0.1)^3. Then expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n +0.1)^3. Again, as n→∞, numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so expression ~1/3.

Alternatively, take x approaching 0 through x=1/(n - 0.1). Then [1/x] = [n -0.1] = n -1. Wait, but 1/x =n -0.1, so [1/x] = n -1. Then sum is up to n -1. So expression is [(n -1)n(2n -1)/6]/(n -0.1)^3. Let&#x27;s compute this:

Numerator: (n -1)n(2n -1) ≈ (n² -n)(2n -1) ≈2n³ -n² -2n² +n ≈2n³ -3n² +n ~2n³

Denominator:6(n -0.1)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.1/n)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.3/n + ...) ~6n³

Thus, the expression ~2n³/(6n³)=1/3. So still converges to 1/3.

Therefore, regardless of how x approaches 0, as long as we take the limit, the expression tends to 1/3.

But wait, in the initial approximation, we neglected the δ term, assuming that n ≈1/x. But even when we considered δ, the correction terms ended up vanishing in the limit. Therefore, the limit is indeed 1/3.

But the sum is actually larger than the integral. The integral from 0 to n of t² dt = n³/3, and the sum from k=1 to n of k² is ~n³/3 + n²/2 + n/6. So the leading term is n³/3. So when we multiply by x³, and since n = [1/x] ≈1/x, the leading term is (1/x)³/3 *x³ =1/3, which matches our previous result. The next term would be n²/2 ~ (1/x²)/2 *x³ =x/2, which tends to 0. So this also suggests that the limit is 1/3.

Therefore, multiple approaches confirm that the limit is 1/3.

Substituting \(n \approx \frac{1}{|x|}\) (since \(n\) is the integer part of \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) and the difference becomes negligible as \(x \to 0\)), we approximate the sum:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right)\left(\frac{1}{|x|} + 1\right)\left(2\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right) + 1\right)}{6}
\]

Expanding and simplifying the terms, we get:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{1}{|x|^3} \cdot \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|^2} \cdot \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|} \cdot \frac{1}{6}

Multiplying this sum by \(x^3\) and considering the leading terms as \(x \to 0\):

\[
x^3 \left( \frac{2}{6|x|^3} + \frac{3}{6|x|^2} + \frac{1}{6|x|} \right) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{6}
\]

As \(x \to 0\), the terms \(\frac{x}{2}\) and \(\frac{x^2}{6}\) approach 0, leaving the limit as:

So maybe we can replace n with 1/|x| in the formula, but we need to be careful with the error terms.

So substituting n ≈ 1/|x|, then the sum becomes approximately (1/|x|)(1/|x| + 1)(2*(1/|x|) + 1)/6. Let me write this out:

Sum ≈ (1/|x|) * (1/|x| + 1) * (2/|x| + 1)/6

Multiply these terms out:

First, multiply (1/|x| + 1) and (2/|x| + 1):

(1/|x|)(2/|x|) + (1/|x|)(1) + 1*(2/|x|) + 1*1

= 2/|x|² + 1/|x| + 2/|x| + 1

= 2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1

Then multiply by (1/|x|)/6:

(1/|x|)/6 * (2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1) = (2/|x|³ + 3/|x|² + 1/|x|)/6

So the sum is approximately (2/(6|x|³) + 3/(6|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)) = (1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|))

Now, the original expression is x³ times this sum:

x³ * [1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)]

Since x is approaching 0, let&#x27;s consider x approaching 0 from the positive side first, so |x| = x. Then, we can write:

x³ * [1/(3x³) + 1/(2x²) + 1/(6x)] = x³*(1/(3x³)) + x³*(1/(2x²)) + x³*(1/(6x))

Simplify each term:

First term: x³/(3x³) = 1/3

Second term: x³/(2x²) = x/2

Third term: x³/(6x) = x²/6

As x approaches 0, the second and third terms approach 0, so the entire expression approaches 1/3.

But wait, is this correct? Because we approximated n as 1/x, but actually n = [1/x], which is 1/x minus a fractional part less than 1. So n = 1/x - {1/x}, where {1/x} is the fractional part. Therefore, n = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. So when we plug n into the sum formula, maybe we need to consider the effect of δ?

Hmm, let&#x27;s analyze that. Let me write n = [1/x] = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. Then, the sum is:

Sum = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 = (1/x - δ)(1/x - δ + 1)(2(1/x - δ) + 1)/6

This looks complicated. Let&#x27;s expand this expression step by step.

First, compute each bracket:

First term: (1/x - δ)

Second term: (1/x - δ + 1) = (1/x + 1 - δ)

Third term: 2(1/x - δ) + 1 = 2/x - 2δ + 1

Multiply all three terms:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ)(2/x + 1 - 2δ)

This seems messy, but maybe we can expand this in terms of 1/x. Since δ is between 0 and 1, and x is approaching 0, 1/x is large, so terms with higher powers of 1/x will dominate.

Let me expand the first two factors first:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ) = (1/x)(1/x + 1 - δ) - δ(1/x + 1 - δ)

= (1/x² + (1 - δ)/x) - (δ/x + δ(1 - δ))

= 1/x² + (1 - δ)/x - δ/x - δ(1 - δ)

Simplify:

1/x² + [ (1 - δ) - δ ] /x - δ(1 - δ)

= 1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²

Now multiply this by the third factor (2/x + 1 - 2δ):

[1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²] * [2/x + 1 - 2δ]

Let&#x27;s multiply term by term:

First term: 1/x² * 2/x = 2/x³

Second term: 1/x² * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)/x²

Third term: (1 - 2δ)/x * 2/x = 2(1 - 2δ)/x²

Fourth term: (1 - 2δ)/x * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)^2 /x

Fifth term: (-δ + δ²) * 2/x = (-2δ + 2δ²)/x

Sixth term: (-δ + δ²) * (1 - 2δ) = -δ(1 - 2δ) + δ²(1 - 2δ) = -δ + 2δ² + δ² - 2δ³ = -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So combining all terms:

2/x³ + (1 - 2δ)/x² + 2(1 - 2δ)/x² + (1 - 2δ)^2 /x + (-2δ + 2δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Combine like terms:

For 1/x³: 2/x³

For 1/x²: [ (1 - 2δ) + 2(1 - 2δ) ] /x² = [1 - 2δ + 2 - 4δ]/x² = (3 - 6δ)/x²

For 1/x: [ (1 - 2δ)^2 + (-2δ + 2δ²) ] /x

Let me compute (1 - 2δ)^2:

= 1 - 4δ + 4δ²

So adding (-2δ + 2δ²):

1 - 4δ + 4δ² -2δ + 2δ² = 1 - 6δ + 6δ²

Therefore, the 1/x term is (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x

Constant term: -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So overall, the product is:

2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Therefore, the sum is:

[2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)] /6

So when we multiply this by x³, the original expression becomes:

x³ * Sum ≈ x³ * [2/(6x³) + (3 - 6δ)/(6x²) + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6]

Simplify each term:

First term: x³*(2)/(6x³) = 2/6 = 1/3

Second term: x³*(3 - 6δ)/(6x²) = (3 - 6δ)x/(6) = (1 - 2δ)x/2

Third term: x³*(1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) = (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)x²/6

Fourth term: x³*(-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6 = (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)x³/6

Now, as x approaches 0, δ is between 0 and 1. So δ is bounded. Therefore, the second term is O(x), the third term is O(x²), and the fourth term is O(x³). All of these go to 0 as x approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is determined by the first term, which is 1/3. So the limit is 1/3?

But wait, but δ is dependent on x. Since δ = 1/x - n, where n is [1/x], so δ = {1/x}, the fractional part of 1/x. So as x approaches 0, 1/x can be written as integer plus fractional part. So δ is between 0 and 1. However, as x approaches 0, depending on the sequence of x&#x27;s approaching 0, δ can oscillate between 0 and 1. For example, if x approaches 0 through 1/n for integer n, then δ = 0. If x approaches 0 through 1/(n + 0.5), then δ = 0.5. So δ can vary. However, in our calculation above, the only term that could possibly depend on δ is the second term (1 - 2δ)x/2, but even though δ varies between 0 and 1, as x approaches 0, (1 - 2δ) is bounded (since δ is between 0 and1, 1 - 2δ is between -1 and1), so (1 - 2δ)x/2 approaches 0 as x approaches 0 regardless of δ. Similarly, the other terms also vanish. Therefore, regardless of the value of δ, the limit is 1/3. So maybe the answer is 1/3.

But let me check with specific sequences. Suppose x approaches 0 through the sequence x_n = 1/n, where n is a positive integer. Then [1/x] = [n] = n. Then the sum is 1² + 2² + ... + n² = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Multiply by x³ = (1/n³):

So expression is (1/n³) * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6] = [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n³) = [(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n²)

Expand numerator: (n + 1)(2n +1) = 2n² + 3n +1

Therefore, expression is (2n² + 3n +1)/(6n²) = (2 + 3/n + 1/n²)/6

As n approaches infinity, this approaches (2 + 0 +0)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3. So that&#x27;s consistent.

Now, take another sequence where x approaches 0 through x = 1/(n + 0.5), where n is integer. Then [1/x] = [n + 0.5] = n. So sum is still up to n, same as before. Then x = 1/(n + 0.5), so x³ = 1/(n + 0.5)^3, and the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + 0.5)^3.

Let me compute this as n approaches infinity. Let&#x27;s write n + 0.5 as n(1 + 0.5/n). Then denominator is (n(1 + 0.5/n))³ = n³(1 + 0.5/n)^3 ≈ n³(1 + 1.5/n + ...) by binomial expansion.

Numerator: n(n +1)(2n +1) ≈ n*(n)(2n) = 2n³. So numerator ≈2n³, denominator≈6n³. Therefore, expression ≈2n³/(6n³) = 1/3. The higher order terms would be lower order in n, so as n approaches infinity, the expression still approaches 1/3. So regardless of how x approaches 0, the limit seems to be 1/3.

But let me test with x approaching 0 through some irrational sequence. For example, x = 1/(n + sqrt(2)), but here [1/x] would still be n, as 1/x = n + sqrt(2), so [1/x] = n. So similar to the previous case, the sum would be up to n, and x³ = 1/(n + sqrt(2))³. Then the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + sqrt(2))³. As n approaches infinity, the same reasoning applies: numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so limit 1/3.

Therefore, seems like regardless of the approach path, the limit is 1/3.

But let me check with another example where x approaches 0 in a different way, say x = 1/(n + ε), where ε is a fixed between 0 and1. For instance, ε=0.1. Then [1/x] = n, sum is up to n, x³ =1/(n +0.1)^3. Then expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n +0.1)^3. Again, as n→∞, numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so expression ~1/3.

Alternatively, take x approaching 0 through x=1/(n - 0.1). Then [1/x] = [n -0.1] = n -1. Wait, but 1/x =n -0.1, so [1/x] = n -1. Then sum is up to n -1. So expression is [(n -1)n(2n -1)/6]/(n -0.1)^3. Let&#x27;s compute this:

Numerator: (n -1)n(2n -1) ≈ (n² -n)(2n -1) ≈2n³ -n² -2n² +n ≈2n³ -3n² +n ~2n³

Denominator:6(n -0.1)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.1/n)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.3/n + ...) ~6n³

Thus, the expression ~2n³/(6n³)=1/3. So still converges to 1/3.

Therefore, regardless of how x approaches 0, as long as we take the limit, the expression tends to 1/3.

But wait, in the initial approximation, we neglected the δ term, assuming that n ≈1/x. But even when we considered δ, the correction terms ended up vanishing in the limit. Therefore, the limit is indeed 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use integral approximation for the sum. The sum from k=1 to n of k² is approximately the integral from 0 to n of t² dt, which is n³/3. But the sum is actually larger than the integral. The integral from 0 to n of t² dt = n³/3, and the sum from k=1 to n of k² is ~n³/3 + n²/2 + n/6. So the leading term is n³/3. So when we multiply by x³, and since n = [1/x] ≈1/x, the leading term is (1/x)³/3 *x³ =1/3, which matches our previous result. The next term would be n²/2 ~ (1/x²)/2 *x³ =x/2, which tends to 0. So this also suggests that the limit is 1/3.

Therefore, multiple approaches confirm that the limit is 1/3.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the limit \(\lim \limits_{x \to 0} \ x^3\Big(1+2^2+3^2+\ldots+\Big[\frac{1}{\vert x \vert}\Big]^2\Big)\), we start by noting that as \(x \to 0\), \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) becomes very large. Let \(n = \left[\frac{1}{|x|}\right]\), which is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{|x|}\). The sum of squares from 1 to \(n\) is given by the formula:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\]

Substituting \(n \approx \frac{1}{|x|}\) (since \(n\) is the integer part of \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) and the difference becomes negligible as \(x \to 0\)), we approximate the sum:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right)\left(\frac{1}{|x|} + 1\right)\left(2\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right) + 1\right)}{6}
\]

Expanding and simplifying the terms, we get:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{1}{|x|^3} \cdot \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|^2} \cdot \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|} \cdot \frac{1}{6}
\]

Multiplying this sum by \(x^3\) and considering the leading terms as \(x \to 0\):

\[
x^3 \left( \frac{2}{6|x|^3} + \frac{3}{6|x|^2} + \frac{1}{6|x|} \right) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{6}
\]

As \(x \to 0\), the terms \(\frac{x}{2}\) and \(\frac{x^2}{6}\) approach 0, leaving the limit as:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limit as x approaches 0 of x cubed multiplied by the sum of squares from 1 up to [1/|x|], where [.] is the greatest integer function. Hmm, let me start by understanding what this sum looks like.

First, when x approaches 0, 1/|x| becomes very large. So, [1/|x|] is the integer part of 1/|x|. Let&#x27;s denote n = [1/|x|]. Then, the sum in question is 1² + 2² + 3² + ... + n². I remember there&#x27;s a formula for the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers. Let me recall it. I think it&#x27;s n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Let me verify that. For example, if n=1, sum is 1, formula gives 1*2*3/6=6/6=1. If n=2, sum is 1+4=5, formula gives 2*3*5/6=30/6=5. Yeah, that seems right. So the sum is n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6.

So substituting back, the expression becomes x³ * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6], where n = [1/|x|]. Since x is approaching 0, n is a large integer. So maybe I can approximate n as approximately 1/|x|, since [1/|x|] is the integer part, but as x approaches 0, the difference between 1/|x| and [1/|x|] becomes negligible. Is that right? Let&#x27;s see. For example, if x is approaching 0 from the positive side, then |x| = x, and [1/x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 1/x. So 1/x - 1 &lt; [1/x] ≤ 1/x. Therefore, as x approaches 0, 1/x becomes very large, and [1/x] ≈ 1/x with an error of less than 1. So maybe we can replace n with 1/|x| in the formula, but we need to be careful with the error terms.

So substituting n ≈ 1/|x|, then the sum becomes approximately (1/|x|)(1/|x| + 1)(2*(1/|x|) + 1)/6. Let me write this out:

Sum ≈ (1/|x|) * (1/|x| + 1) * (2/|x| + 1)/6

Multiply these terms out:

First, multiply (1/|x| + 1) and (2/|x| + 1):

(1/|x|)(2/|x|) + (1/|x|)(1) + 1*(2/|x|) + 1*1

= 2/|x|² + 1/|x| + 2/|x| + 1

= 2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1

Then multiply by (1/|x|)/6:

(1/|x|)/6 * (2/|x|² + 3/|x| + 1) = (2/|x|³ + 3/|x|² + 1/|x|)/6

So the sum is approximately (2/(6|x|³) + 3/(6|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)) = (1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|))

Now, the original expression is x³ times this sum:

x³ * [1/(3|x|³) + 1/(2|x|²) + 1/(6|x|)]

Since x is approaching 0, let&#x27;s consider x approaching 0 from the positive side first, so |x| = x. Then, we can write:

x³ * [1/(3x³) + 1/(2x²) + 1/(6x)] = x³*(1/(3x³)) + x³*(1/(2x²)) + x³*(1/(6x))

Simplify each term:

First term: x³/(3x³) = 1/3

Second term: x³/(2x²) = x/2

Third term: x³/(6x) = x²/6

As x approaches 0, the second and third terms approach 0, so the entire expression approaches 1/3.

But wait, is this correct? Because we approximated n as 1/x, but actually n = [1/x], which is 1/x minus a fractional part less than 1. So n = 1/x - {1/x}, where {1/x} is the fractional part. Therefore, n = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. So when we plug n into the sum formula, maybe we need to consider the effect of δ?

Hmm, let&#x27;s analyze that. Let me write n = [1/x] = 1/x - δ, where 0 ≤ δ &lt; 1. Then, the sum is:

Sum = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 = (1/x - δ)(1/x - δ + 1)(2(1/x - δ) + 1)/6

This looks complicated. Let&#x27;s expand this expression step by step.

First, compute each bracket:

First term: (1/x - δ)

Second term: (1/x - δ + 1) = (1/x + 1 - δ)

Third term: 2(1/x - δ) + 1 = 2/x - 2δ + 1

Multiply all three terms:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ)(2/x + 1 - 2δ)

This seems messy, but maybe we can expand this in terms of 1/x. Since δ is between 0 and 1, and x is approaching 0, 1/x is large, so terms with higher powers of 1/x will dominate.

Let me expand the first two factors first:

(1/x - δ)(1/x + 1 - δ) = (1/x)(1/x + 1 - δ) - δ(1/x + 1 - δ)

= (1/x² + (1 - δ)/x) - (δ/x + δ(1 - δ))

= 1/x² + (1 - δ)/x - δ/x - δ(1 - δ)

Simplify:

1/x² + [ (1 - δ) - δ ] /x - δ(1 - δ)

= 1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²

Now multiply this by the third factor (2/x + 1 - 2δ):

[1/x² + (1 - 2δ)/x - δ + δ²] * [2/x + 1 - 2δ]

Let&#x27;s multiply term by term:

First term: 1/x² * 2/x = 2/x³

Second term: 1/x² * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)/x²

Third term: (1 - 2δ)/x * 2/x = 2(1 - 2δ)/x²

Fourth term: (1 - 2δ)/x * (1 - 2δ) = (1 - 2δ)^2 /x

Fifth term: (-δ + δ²) * 2/x = (-2δ + 2δ²)/x

Sixth term: (-δ + δ²) * (1 - 2δ) = -δ(1 - 2δ) + δ²(1 - 2δ) = -δ + 2δ² + δ² - 2δ³ = -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So combining all terms:

2/x³ + (1 - 2δ)/x² + 2(1 - 2δ)/x² + (1 - 2δ)^2 /x + (-2δ + 2δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Combine like terms:

For 1/x³: 2/x³

For 1/x²: [ (1 - 2δ) + 2(1 - 2δ) ] /x² = [1 - 2δ + 2 - 4δ]/x² = (3 - 6δ)/x²

For 1/x: [ (1 - 2δ)^2 + (-2δ + 2δ²) ] /x

Let me compute (1 - 2δ)^2:

= 1 - 4δ + 4δ²

So adding (-2δ + 2δ²):

1 - 4δ + 4δ² -2δ + 2δ² = 1 - 6δ + 6δ²

Therefore, the 1/x term is (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x

Constant term: -δ + 3δ² - 2δ³

So overall, the product is:

2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)

Therefore, the sum is:

[2/x³ + (3 - 6δ)/x² + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/x + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)] /6

So when we multiply this by x³, the original expression becomes:

x³ * Sum ≈ x³ * [2/(6x³) + (3 - 6δ)/(6x²) + (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) + (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6]

Simplify each term:

First term: x³*(2)/(6x³) = 2/6 = 1/3

Second term: x³*(3 - 6δ)/(6x²) = (3 - 6δ)x/(6) = (1 - 2δ)x/2

Third term: x³*(1 - 6δ + 6δ²)/(6x) = (1 - 6δ + 6δ²)x²/6

Fourth term: x³*(-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)/6 = (-δ + 3δ² - 2δ³)x³/6

Now, as x approaches 0, δ is between 0 and 1. So δ is bounded. Therefore, the second term is O(x), the third term is O(x²), and the fourth term is O(x³). All of these go to 0 as x approaches 0. Therefore, the limit is determined by the first term, which is 1/3. So the limit is 1/3?

But wait, but δ is dependent on x. Since δ = 1/x - n, where n is [1/x], so δ = {1/x}, the fractional part of 1/x. So as x approaches 0, 1/x can be written as integer plus fractional part. So δ is between 0 and 1. However, as x approaches 0, depending on the sequence of x&#x27;s approaching 0, δ can oscillate between 0 and 1. For example, if x approaches 0 through 1/n for integer n, then δ = 0. If x approaches 0 through 1/(n + 0.5), then δ = 0.5. So δ can vary. However, in our calculation above, the only term that could possibly depend on δ is the second term (1 - 2δ)x/2, but even though δ varies between 0 and 1, as x approaches 0, (1 - 2δ) is bounded (since δ is between 0 and1, 1 - 2δ is between -1 and1), so (1 - 2δ)x/2 approaches 0 as x approaches 0 regardless of δ. Similarly, the other terms also vanish. Therefore, regardless of the value of δ, the limit is 1/3. So maybe the answer is 1/3.

But let me check with specific sequences. Suppose x approaches 0 through the sequence x_n = 1/n, where n is a positive integer. Then [1/x] = [n] = n. Then the sum is 1² + 2² + ... + n² = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6. Multiply by x³ = (1/n³):

So expression is (1/n³) * [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6] = [n(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n³) = [(n + 1)(2n + 1)]/(6n²)

Expand numerator: (n + 1)(2n +1) = 2n² + 3n +1

Therefore, expression is (2n² + 3n +1)/(6n²) = (2 + 3/n + 1/n²)/6

As n approaches infinity, this approaches (2 + 0 +0)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3. So that&#x27;s consistent.

Now, take another sequence where x approaches 0 through x = 1/(n + 0.5), where n is integer. Then [1/x] = [n + 0.5] = n. So sum is still up to n, same as before. Then x = 1/(n + 0.5), so x³ = 1/(n + 0.5)^3, and the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + 0.5)^3.

Let me compute this as n approaches infinity. Let&#x27;s write n + 0.5 as n(1 + 0.5/n). Then denominator is (n(1 + 0.5/n))³ = n³(1 + 0.5/n)^3 ≈ n³(1 + 1.5/n + ...) by binomial expansion.

Numerator: n(n +1)(2n +1) ≈ n*(n)(2n) = 2n³. So numerator ≈2n³, denominator≈6n³. Therefore, expression ≈2n³/(6n³) = 1/3. The higher order terms would be lower order in n, so as n approaches infinity, the expression still approaches 1/3. So regardless of how x approaches 0, the limit seems to be 1/3.

But let me test with x approaching 0 through some irrational sequence. For example, x = 1/(n + sqrt(2)), but here [1/x] would still be n, as 1/x = n + sqrt(2), so [1/x] = n. So similar to the previous case, the sum would be up to n, and x³ = 1/(n + sqrt(2))³. Then the expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n + sqrt(2))³. As n approaches infinity, the same reasoning applies: numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so limit 1/3.

Therefore, seems like regardless of the approach path, the limit is 1/3.

But let me check with another example where x approaches 0 in a different way, say x = 1/(n + ε), where ε is a fixed between 0 and1. For instance, ε=0.1. Then [1/x] = n, sum is up to n, x³ =1/(n +0.1)^3. Then expression is [n(n +1)(2n +1)/6]/(n +0.1)^3. Again, as n→∞, numerator ~2n³, denominator ~6n³, so expression ~1/3.

Alternatively, take x approaching 0 through x=1/(n - 0.1). Then [1/x] = [n -0.1] = n -1. Wait, but 1/x =n -0.1, so [1/x] = n -1. Then sum is up to n -1. So expression is [(n -1)n(2n -1)/6]/(n -0.1)^3. Let&#x27;s compute this:

Numerator: (n -1)n(2n -1) ≈ (n² -n)(2n -1) ≈2n³ -n² -2n² +n ≈2n³ -3n² +n ~2n³

Denominator:6(n -0.1)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.1/n)^3 ≈6n³(1 -0.3/n + ...) ~6n³

Thus, the expression ~2n³/(6n³)=1/3. So still converges to 1/3.

Therefore, regardless of how x approaches 0, as long as we take the limit, the expression tends to 1/3.

But wait, in the initial approximation, we neglected the δ term, assuming that n ≈1/x. But even when we considered δ, the correction terms ended up vanishing in the limit. Therefore, the limit is indeed 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use integral approximation for the sum. The sum from k=1 to n of k² is approximately the integral from 0 to n of t² dt, which is n³/3. But the sum is actually larger than the integral. The integral from 0 to n of t² dt = n³/3, and the sum from k=1 to n of k² is ~n³/3 + n²/2 + n/6. So the leading term is n³/3. So when we multiply by x³, and since n = [1/x] ≈1/x, the leading term is (1/x)³/3 *x³ =1/3, which matches our previous result. The next term would be n²/2 ~ (1/x²)/2 *x³ =x/2, which tends to 0. So this also suggests that the limit is 1/3.

Therefore, multiple approaches confirm that the limit is 1/3.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the limit \(\lim \limits_{x \to 0} \ x^3\Big(1+2^2+3^2+\ldots+\Big[\frac{1}{\vert x \vert}\Big]^2\Big)\), we start by noting that as \(x \to 0\), \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) becomes very large. Let \(n = \left[\frac{1}{|x|}\right]\), which is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{|x|}\). The sum of squares from 1 to \(n\) is given by the formula:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
\]

Substituting \(n \approx \frac{1}{|x|}\) (since \(n\) is the integer part of \(\frac{1}{|x|}\) and the difference becomes negligible as \(x \to 0\)), we approximate the sum:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right)\left(\frac{1}{|x|} + 1\right)\left(2\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right) + 1\right)}{6}
\]

Expanding and simplifying the terms, we get:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 \approx \frac{1}{|x|^3} \cdot \frac{2}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|^2} \cdot \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{|x|} \cdot \frac{1}{6}
\]

Multiplying this sum by \(x^3\) and considering the leading terms as \(x \to 0\):

\[
x^3 \left( \frac{2}{6|x|^3} + \frac{3}{6|x|^2} + \frac{1}{6|x|} \right) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{6}
\]

As \(x \to 0\), the terms \(\frac{x}{2}\) and \(\frac{x^2}{6}\) approach 0, leaving the limit as:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}
