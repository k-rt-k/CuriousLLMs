Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field F_3 = {0, 1, 2} that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group S_3 on the basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}. The action is given by permuting the basis vectors according to the permutation σ. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a vector space V = F_3^3, and the symmetric group S_3 acts on the basis vectors by permuting their indices. For example, if σ is the permutation (1 2 3), then σ·e_1 = e_2, σ·e_2 = e_3, and σ·e_3 = e_1. This action extends linearly to the entire vector space. 

The question is asking for the number of vectors in V that are fixed by every element of S_3. That is, we need all vectors v ∈ V such that σ·v = v for every σ in S_3. 

Since S_3 is a group, it&#x27;s generated by its elements. So, instead of checking the condition for every σ in S_3, maybe I can check it for a set of generators of S_3. The symmetric group S_3 is generated by a transposition and a 3-cycle, for example, the transposition (1 2) and the 3-cycle (1 2 3). If a vector is fixed by these two permutations, it will be fixed by the entire group. 

But perhaps it&#x27;s easier to consider all permutations. Let me think.

First, let&#x27;s recall that a vector v in V can be written as v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, where a, b, c ∈ F_3. The action of S_3 on such a vector permutes the coefficients a, b, c according to the permutation of the basis vectors. For example, applying the permutation (1 2) to v gives (1 2)·v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. 

Therefore, for v to be fixed by every permutation, it must satisfy that for every σ ∈ S_3, the coefficients a, b, c are permuted among themselves without changing. That is, the coefficients must be invariant under any permutation of their indices. 

Therefore, the only way this can happen is if all the coefficients a, b, c are equal. For example, if a = b = c, then permuting them won&#x27;t change the vector. Conversely, if permuting the coefficients doesn&#x27;t change the vector, then all coefficients must be equal. 

So, the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are exactly the vectors of the form (k, k, k) where k ∈ F_3. Therefore, there are three such vectors: (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), and (2, 2, 2). 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check this. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then any permutation will just rearrange the entries, but since they are all the same, the vector remains the same. That seems correct. 

But is this the only case? Suppose a vector is not all the same entries. For example, take (1, 1, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2 3), which cycles the coordinates, we get (0, 1, 1). Since (1, 1, 0) ≠ (0, 1, 1) in F_3^3, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, a vector with two entries the same and one different, like (1, 1, 2), if we apply the transposition (1 2), it remains (1, 1, 2), but if we apply the transposition (1 3), it becomes (2, 1, 1), which is different. Therefore, unless all entries are equal, the vector is not fixed by all permutations. 

But wait, in F_3, (1,1,2) when transposed (1 3) becomes (2,1,1). Since in vectors over F_3, the order matters even if the entries are in a field. So unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. Hence, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). So that&#x27;s three vectors. But wait, is that all? Let me check with another example. Suppose the vector is (0,0,0). Obviously, permuting does nothing. If the vector is (1,1,1), same thing. (2,2,2) as well. 

But maybe there&#x27;s another possibility. Suppose we have a vector that is fixed even though the entries are not all equal. For instance, in some cases, maybe scaling by the field elements could allow more fixed vectors. Wait, but over F_3, the scalars are 0, 1, 2. If the entries are not all the same, permuting them would require that the entries are equal. For example, suppose we have a vector (a, b, c). If applying the permutation (1 2) leaves it fixed, then (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies that a = b. Similarly, applying (1 3) implies a = c, and applying (2 3) implies b = c. Therefore, all three must be equal. Hence, indeed, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed by the entire group. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector. Since the field is F_3, there are three such vectors: 0*(1,1,1) = (0,0,0), 1*(1,1,1) = (1,1,1), and 2*(1,1,1) = (2,2,2). So the cardinality is 3. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check again. Suppose we have the vector (1,1,1). Applying any permutation would not change it, correct. But could there be another vector where, say, even though the entries are different, they are arranged in such a way that permuting doesn&#x27;t change the vector? For example, maybe if the entries are arranged symmetrically in some way. But over F_3, the entries are just elements of the field. The only way for a permutation not to change the vector is if all entries are equal. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so if you have two different entries, swapping them would result in a different vector, unless they are equal. 

Therefore, yes, the conclusion is that the fixed vectors are those with all entries equal. Hence, there are three such vectors. Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

But wait, let me think again. Maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing here. Let me rephrase the problem. The symmetric group S_3 acts by permuting the basis vectors. So when they say &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}&quot;, this is a permutation of the basis vectors, which induces a linear transformation on the vector space. So the action on a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is that σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. But wait, is that correct? Or is it that the permutation permutes the coefficients? 

Wait, no. If you have a permutation σ, then σ acts on the basis vectors, so σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, to compute σ ⋅ v, where v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, you have σ ⋅ v = a σ ⋅ e_1 + b σ ⋅ e_2 + c σ ⋅ e_3 = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in terms of coordinates, this would correspond to swapping the first and second coordinates. Similarly, a 3-cycle would cycle the coordinates. 

Therefore, the action on the vector v is equivalent to permuting its coordinates according to σ. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (a_{σ^{-1}(1)}, a_{σ^{-1}(2)}, a_{σ^{-1}(3)})? Wait, hold on. There&#x27;s a difference between left and right actions here. Let me clarify. 

Suppose we have a permutation σ, which is a bijection σ: {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3}. The action on the basis vectors is σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, if we have a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, then σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But when we express this in terms of the original basis, we need to write σ ⋅ v as a linear combination of e_1, e_2, e_3. So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in coordinates, the vector (a, b, c) becomes (b, a, c). Similarly, for a 3-cycle σ = (1 2 3), we have σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which in coordinates is (c, a, b). 

Therefore, the action of σ on the coordinates is given by permuting the coordinates according to the inverse of σ. Wait, let&#x27;s verify this. If σ = (1 2 3), then σ(1) = 2, σ(2) = 3, σ(3) = 1. So σ ⋅ e_1 = e_2, σ ⋅ e_2 = e_3, σ ⋅ e_3 = e_1. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which corresponds to the vector (c, a, b). 

But if we think of how permutations act on coordinates, if we have a permutation σ, the corresponding permutation of the coordinates is σ^{-1}. Because if you have a permutation σ, the coordinate representation of σ ⋅ v is (c, a, b) when σ is (1 2 3). Let me check with another example. Take σ = (1 2). Then σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (b, a, c). But σ^{-1} is also (1 2), since transpositions are self-inverse. So in this case, the coordinate permutation is indeed σ^{-1} acting on the coordinates. 

Therefore, in general, the action of σ on the vector v is given by permuting the coordinates according to σ^{-1}. But for our purposes, since we are considering all σ in S_3, and the group is closed under inverses, requiring that the vector is fixed under all σ in S_3 is equivalent to requiring that the vector is fixed under all permutations of its coordinates. 

Therefore, the vectors fixed by the S_3 action are exactly the vectors whose coordinates are invariant under any permutation. Therefore, as previously thought, such vectors must have all coordinates equal. Hence, the fixed vectors are (k, k, k) for k ∈ F_3, which gives three vectors. 

But let me confirm this with an example. Suppose we have a vector (1, 1, 1). Applying any permutation σ, we get (1, 1, 1) again. Similarly, (2, 2, 2) and (0, 0, 0). Are there any other vectors? Suppose we take (1, 1, 0). Applying the permutation (1 2 3) to this vector would cycle the coordinates, resulting in (0, 1, 1), which is different from (1, 1, 0). Therefore, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, (1, 2, 1). Applying the transposition (2 3) would give (1, 1, 2), which is different. 

Another test: consider (1, 2, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2), we get (2, 1, 0). Since 1 ≠ 2 in F_3, this vector isn&#x27;t fixed. 

Wait a minute, but in F_3, 2 is equal to -1, right? So 2 is distinct from 1. So indeed, unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a non-trivial combination where permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector. For example, if the entries are arranged in such a way that they are symmetric with respect to all permutations. But over F_3, the only way that permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector is if all entries are the same. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so unless all entries are equal, swapping two different entries would result in a different vector. 

Therefore, it&#x27;s confirmed that the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are precisely the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector, hence three vectors in total. 

But just to make sure, let&#x27;s think in terms of linear algebra. The fixed vectors under a group action form a subspace, called the invariant subspace. In this case, the fixed subspace under S_3. To find its dimension, we can use the concept of averaging over the group, but since we are over a finite field, we need to be careful. 

Alternatively, we can note that the action of S_3 is a permutation representation, and the fixed vectors are the trivial subrepresentation, which is one-dimensional if the field is algebraically closed and the characteristic doesn&#x27;t divide the group order. However, here the field is F_3, which has characteristic 3, and 3 divides the order of S_3 (which is 6). Therefore, Maschke&#x27;s theorem doesn&#x27;t apply, and the representation is not semisimple. 

But in our case, we are just looking for the vectors fixed by the entire group. Regardless of the structure of the representation, the fixed vectors can be found by solving the equations σ(v) = v for all σ ∈ S_3. 

But since S_3 is generated by transpositions, we can just consider the transpositions. Let&#x27;s take the transposition (1 2). For a vector (a, b, c) to be fixed by (1 2), we must have (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies a = b. Similarly, applying the transposition (1 3) gives (c, b, a) = (a, b, c), so a = c. Hence, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, even if we just consider the transpositions, we get that a = b = c. Therefore, only the vectors with all coordinates equal are fixed by S_3. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are three such vectors: (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). Hence, the cardinality is 3. 

But wait, hold on. Let me check once again. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then under any permutation, it remains (a, a, a). Therefore, these are fixed. Suppose there exists another vector fixed by all permutations. Then, since S_3 acts by permuting the coordinates, such a vector must have all coordinates equal. Therefore, the fixed subspace is indeed { (a, a, a) | a ∈ F_3 }, which has size 3. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

However, let me consider the possibility that maybe the problem is not about permuting the coordinates, but permuting the basis vectors. Wait, the problem says &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)} for all σ ∈ S_3&quot;. Therefore, the action on a general vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But in terms of coordinates with respect to the original basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}, this permutes the basis vectors, hence permuting the coefficients accordingly. For example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3. In terms of the original basis, this is b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. Therefore, the coordinates of σ ⋅ v are (b, a, c). 

Therefore, as before, to have σ ⋅ v = v for all σ ∈ S_3, the coordinates must satisfy that for any permutation of the coordinates, the vector remains the same. Therefore, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are those with all coordinates equal, so three vectors. 

But wait, maybe in the vector space over F_3, the equations a = b = c have only three solutions: a = 0,1,2. Therefore, the fixed vectors are indeed (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). 

Therefore, the cardinality is 3. 

So, after going through this reasoning, I think the answer is 3. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{3}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field \(\Bbb F_3 = \{0, 1, 2\}\) that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group \(S_3\) on the basis \(\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}\), we need to find all vectors \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) such that \(\sigma \cdot v = v\) for every \(\sigma \in S_3\).

The action of a permutation \(\sigma \in S_3\) on a vector \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) permutes the basis vectors, resulting in the vector \(\sigma \cdot v = a e_{\sigma(1)} + b e_{\sigma(2)} + c e_{\sigma(3)}\). For \(v\) to be fixed by all permutations, the coefficients \(a, b, c\) must remain unchanged under any permutation of their indices.

This implies that \(a, b, c\) must be equal. Therefore, the fixed vectors are of the form \((k, k, k)\) where \(k \in \Bbb F_3\). The possible values for \(k\) are 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to the vectors \((0, 0, 0)\), \((1, 1, 1)\), and \((2, 2, 2)\).

Thus, the cardinality of the set of fixed vectors is 3.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field F_3 = {0, 1, 2} that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group S_3 on the basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}. The action is given by permuting the basis vectors according to the permutation σ. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a vector space V = F_3^3, and the symmetric group S_3 acts on the basis vectors by permuting their indices. For example, if σ is the permutation (1 2 3), then σ·e_1 = e_2, σ·e_2 = e_3, and σ·e_3 = e_1. This action extends linearly to the entire vector space. 

The question is asking for the number of vectors in V that are fixed by every element of S_3. That is, we need all vectors v ∈ V such that σ·v = v for every σ in S_3. 

Since S_3 is a group, it&#x27;s generated by its elements. So, instead of checking the condition for every σ in S_3, maybe I can check it for a set of generators of S_3. The symmetric group S_3 is generated by a transposition and a 3-cycle, for example, the transposition (1 2) and the 3-cycle (1 2 3). If a vector is fixed by these two permutations, it will be fixed by the entire group. 

But perhaps it&#x27;s easier to consider all permutations. Let me think.

First, let&#x27;s recall that a vector v in V can be written as v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, where a, b, c ∈ F_3. The action of S_3 on such a vector permutes the coefficients a, b, c according to the permutation of the basis vectors. For example, applying the permutation (1 2) to v gives (1 2)·v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. 

Therefore, for v to be fixed by every permutation, it must satisfy that for every σ ∈ S_3, the coefficients a, b, c are permuted among themselves without changing. That is, the coefficients must be invariant under any permutation of their indices. 

Therefore, the only way this can happen is if all the coefficients a, b, c are equal. For example, if a = b = c, then permuting them won&#x27;t change the vector. Conversely, if permuting the coefficients doesn&#x27;t change the vector, then all coefficients must be equal. 

So, the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are exactly the vectors of the form (k, k, k) where k ∈ F_3. Therefore, there are three such vectors: (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), and (2, 2, 2). 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check this. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then any permutation will just rearrange the entries, but since they are all the same, the vector remains the same. That seems correct. 

But is this the only case? Suppose a vector is not all the same entries. For example, take (1, 1, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2 3), which cycles the coordinates, we get (0, 1, 1). Since (1, 1, 0) ≠ (0, 1, 1) in F_3^3, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, a vector with two entries the same and one different, like (1, 1, 2), if we apply the transposition (1 2), it remains (1, 1, 2), but if we apply the transposition (1 3), it becomes (2, 1, 1), which is different. Therefore, unless all entries are equal, the vector is not fixed by all permutations. 

But wait, in F_3, (1,1,2) when transposed (1 3) becomes (2,1,1). Since in vectors over F_3, the order matters even if the entries are in a field. So unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. Hence, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). So that&#x27;s three vectors. But wait, is that all? Let me check with another example. Suppose the vector is (0,0,0). Obviously, permuting does nothing. If the vector is (1,1,1), same thing. (2,2,2) as well. 

But maybe there&#x27;s another possibility. Suppose we have a vector that is fixed even though the entries are not all equal. For instance, in some cases, maybe scaling by the field elements could allow more fixed vectors. Wait, but over F_3, the scalars are 0, 1, 2. If the entries are not all the same, permuting them would require that the entries are equal. For example, suppose we have a vector (a, b, c). If applying the permutation (1 2) leaves it fixed, then (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies that a = b. Similarly, applying (1 3) implies a = c, and applying (2 3) implies b = c. Therefore, all three must be equal. Hence, indeed, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed by the entire group. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector. Since the field is F_3, there are three such vectors: 0*(1,1,1) = (0,0,0), 1*(1,1,1) = (1,1,1), and 2*(1,1,1) = (2,2,2). So the cardinality is 3. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check again. Suppose we have the vector (1,1,1). Applying any permutation would not change it, correct. But could there be another vector where, say, even though the entries are different, they are arranged in such a way that permuting doesn&#x27;t change the vector? For example, maybe if the entries are arranged symmetrically in some way. But over F_3, the entries are just elements of the field. The only way for a permutation not to change the vector is if all entries are equal. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so if you have two different entries, swapping them would result in a different vector, unless they are equal. 

Therefore, yes, the conclusion is that the fixed vectors are those with all entries equal. Hence, there are three such vectors. Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

But wait, let me think again. Maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing here. Let me rephrase the problem. The symmetric group S_3 acts by permuting the basis vectors. So when they say &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}&quot;, this is a permutation of the basis vectors, which induces a linear transformation on the vector space. So the action on a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is that σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. But wait, is that correct? Or is it that the permutation permutes the coefficients? 

Wait, no. If you have a permutation σ, then σ acts on the basis vectors, so σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, to compute σ ⋅ v, where v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, you have σ ⋅ v = a σ ⋅ e_1 + b σ ⋅ e_2 + c σ ⋅ e_3 = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in terms of coordinates, this would correspond to swapping the first and second coordinates. Similarly, a 3-cycle would cycle the coordinates. 

Therefore, the action on the vector v is equivalent to permuting its coordinates according to σ. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (a_{σ^{-1}(1)}, a_{σ^{-1}(2)}, a_{σ^{-1}(3)})? Wait, hold on. There&#x27;s a difference between left and right actions here. Let me clarify. 

Suppose we have a permutation σ, which is a bijection σ: {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3}. The action on the basis vectors is σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, if we have a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, then σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But when we express this in terms of the original basis, we need to write σ ⋅ v as a linear combination of e_1, e_2, e_3. So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in coordinates, the vector (a, b, c) becomes (b, a, c). Similarly, for a 3-cycle σ = (1 2 3), we have σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which in coordinates is (c, a, b). 

Therefore, the action of σ on the coordinates is given by permuting the coordinates according to the inverse of σ. Wait, let&#x27;s verify this. If σ = (1 2 3), then σ(1) = 2, σ(2) = 3, σ(3) = 1. So σ ⋅ e_1 = e_2, σ ⋅ e_2 = e_3, σ ⋅ e_3 = e_1. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which corresponds to the vector (c, a, b). 

But if we think of how permutations act on coordinates, if we have a permutation σ, the corresponding permutation of the coordinates is σ^{-1}. Because if you have a permutation σ, the coordinate representation of σ ⋅ v is (c, a, b) when σ is (1 2 3). Let me check with another example. Take σ = (1 2). Then σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (b, a, c). But σ^{-1} is also (1 2), since transpositions are self-inverse. So in this case, the coordinate permutation is indeed σ^{-1} acting on the coordinates. 

Therefore, in general, the action of σ on the vector v is given by permuting the coordinates according to σ^{-1}. But for our purposes, since we are considering all σ in S_3, and the group is closed under inverses, requiring that the vector is fixed under all σ in S_3 is equivalent to requiring that the vector is fixed under all permutations of its coordinates. 

Therefore, the vectors fixed by the S_3 action are exactly the vectors whose coordinates are invariant under any permutation. Therefore, as previously thought, such vectors must have all coordinates equal. Hence, the fixed vectors are (k, k, k) for k ∈ F_3, which gives three vectors. 

But let me confirm this with an example. Suppose we have a vector (1, 1, 1). Applying any permutation σ, we get (1, 1, 1) again. Similarly, (2, 2, 2) and (0, 0, 0). Are there any other vectors? Suppose we take (1, 1, 0). Applying the permutation (1 2 3) to this vector would cycle the coordinates, resulting in (0, 1, 1), which is different from (1, 1, 0). Therefore, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, (1, 2, 1). Applying the transposition (2 3) would give (1, 1, 2), which is different. 

Another test: consider (1, 2, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2), we get (2, 1, 0). Since 1 ≠ 2 in F_3, this vector isn&#x27;t fixed. 

Wait a minute, but in F_3, 2 is equal to -1, right? So 2 is distinct from 1. So indeed, unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a non-trivial combination where permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector. For example, if the entries are arranged in such a way that they are symmetric with respect to all permutations. But over F_3, the only way that permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector is if all entries are the same. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so unless all entries are equal, swapping two different entries would result in a different vector. 

Therefore, it&#x27;s confirmed that the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are precisely the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector, hence three vectors in total. 

But just to make sure, let&#x27;s think in terms of linear algebra. The fixed vectors under a group action form a subspace, called the invariant subspace. In this case, the fixed subspace under S_3. To find its dimension, we can use the concept of averaging over the group, but since we are over a finite field, we need to be careful. 

Alternatively, we can note that the action of S_3 is a permutation representation, and the fixed vectors are the trivial subrepresentation, which is one-dimensional if the field is algebraically closed and the characteristic doesn&#x27;t divide the group order. However, here the field is F_3, which has characteristic 3, and 3 divides the order of S_3 (which is 6). Therefore, Maschke&#x27;s theorem doesn&#x27;t apply, and the representation is not semisimple. 

But in our case, we are just looking for the vectors fixed by the entire group. Regardless of the structure of the representation, the fixed vectors can be found by solving the equations σ(v) = v for all σ ∈ S_3. 

But since S_3 is generated by transpositions, we can just consider the transpositions. Let&#x27;s take the transposition (1 2). For a vector (a, b, c) to be fixed by (1 2), we must have (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies a = b. Similarly, applying the transposition (1 3) gives (c, b, a) = (a, b, c), so a = c. Hence, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, even if we just consider the transpositions, we get that a = b = c. Therefore, only the vectors with all coordinates equal are fixed by S_3. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are three such vectors: (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). Hence, the cardinality is 3. 

But wait, hold on. Let me check once again. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then under any permutation, it remains (a, a, a). Therefore, these are fixed. Suppose there exists another vector fixed by all permutations. Then, since S_3 acts by permuting the coordinates, such a vector must have all coordinates equal. Therefore, the fixed subspace is indeed { (a, a, a) | a ∈ F_3 }, which has size 3. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

However, let me consider the possibility that maybe the problem is not about permuting the coordinates, but permuting the basis vectors. Wait, the problem says &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)} for all σ ∈ S_3&quot;. Therefore, the action on a general vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But in terms of coordinates with respect to the original basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}, this permutes the basis vectors, hence permuting the coefficients accordingly. For example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3. In terms of the original basis, this is b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. Therefore, the coordinates of σ ⋅ v are (b, a, c). 

Therefore, as before, to have σ ⋅ v = v for all σ ∈ S_3, the coordinates must satisfy that for any permutation of the coordinates, the vector remains the same. Therefore, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are those with all coordinates equal, so three vectors. 

But wait, maybe in the vector space over F_3, the equations a = b = c have only three solutions: a = 0,1,2. Therefore, the fixed vectors are indeed (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). 

Therefore, the cardinality is 3. 

So, after going through this reasoning, I think the answer is 3. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{3}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field \(\Bbb F_3 = \{0, 1, 2\}\) that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group \(S_3\) on the basis \(\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}\), we need to find all vectors \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) such that \(\sigma \cdot v = v\) for every \(\sigma \in S_3\).

The action of a permutation \(\sigma \in S_3\) on a vector \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) permutes the basis vectors, resulting in the vector \(\sigma \cdot v = a e_{\sigma(1)} + b e_{\sigma(2)} + c e_{\sigma(3)}\). For \(v\) to be fixed by all permutations, the coefficients \(a, b, c\) must remain unchanged under any permutation of their indices.

This implies that \(a, b, c\) must be equal. Therefore, the fixed vectors are of the form \((k, k, k)\) where \(k \in \Bbb F_3\). The possible values for \(k\) are 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to the vectors \((0, 0, 0)\), \((1, 1, 1)\), and \((2, 2, 2)\).

Thus, the cardinality of the set of fixed vectors is 3.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field F_3 = {0, 1, 2} that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group S_3 on the basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}. The action is given by permuting the basis vectors according to the permutation σ. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a vector space V = F_3^3, and the symmetric group S_3 acts on the basis vectors by permuting their indices. For example, if σ is the permutation (1 2 3), then σ·e_1 = e_2, σ·e_2 = e_3, and σ·e_3 = e_1. This action extends linearly to the entire vector space. 

The question is asking for the number of vectors in V that are fixed by every element of S_3. That is, we need all vectors v ∈ V such that σ·v = v for every σ in S_3. 

Since S_3 is a group, it&#x27;s generated by its elements. So, instead of checking the condition for every σ in S_3, maybe I can check it for a set of generators of S_3. The symmetric group S_3 is generated by a transposition and a 3-cycle, for example, the transposition (1 2) and the 3-cycle (1 2 3). If a vector is fixed by these two permutations, it will be fixed by the entire group. 

But perhaps it&#x27;s easier to consider all permutations. Let me think.

First, let&#x27;s recall that a vector v in V can be written as v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, where a, b, c ∈ F_3. The action of S_3 on such a vector permutes the coefficients a, b, c according to the permutation of the basis vectors. For example, applying the permutation (1 2) to v gives (1 2)·v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. 

Therefore, for v to be fixed by every permutation, it must satisfy that for every σ ∈ S_3, the coefficients a, b, c are permuted among themselves without changing. That is, the coefficients must be invariant under any permutation of their indices. 

Therefore, the only way this can happen is if all the coefficients a, b, c are equal. For example, if a = b = c, then permuting them won&#x27;t change the vector. Conversely, if permuting the coefficients doesn&#x27;t change the vector, then all coefficients must be equal. 

So, the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are exactly the vectors of the form (k, k, k) where k ∈ F_3. Therefore, there are three such vectors: (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), and (2, 2, 2). 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check this. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then any permutation will just rearrange the entries, but since they are all the same, the vector remains the same. That seems correct. 

But is this the only case? Suppose a vector is not all the same entries. For example, take (1, 1, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2 3), which cycles the coordinates, we get (0, 1, 1). Since (1, 1, 0) ≠ (0, 1, 1) in F_3^3, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, a vector with two entries the same and one different, like (1, 1, 2), if we apply the transposition (1 2), it remains (1, 1, 2), but if we apply the transposition (1 3), it becomes (2, 1, 1), which is different. Therefore, unless all entries are equal, the vector is not fixed by all permutations. 

But wait, in F_3, (1,1,2) when transposed (1 3) becomes (2,1,1). Since in vectors over F_3, the order matters even if the entries are in a field. So unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. Hence, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). So that&#x27;s three vectors. But wait, is that all? Let me check with another example. Suppose the vector is (0,0,0). Obviously, permuting does nothing. If the vector is (1,1,1), same thing. (2,2,2) as well. 

But maybe there&#x27;s another possibility. Suppose we have a vector that is fixed even though the entries are not all equal. For instance, in some cases, maybe scaling by the field elements could allow more fixed vectors. Wait, but over F_3, the scalars are 0, 1, 2. If the entries are not all the same, permuting them would require that the entries are equal. For example, suppose we have a vector (a, b, c). If applying the permutation (1 2) leaves it fixed, then (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies that a = b. Similarly, applying (1 3) implies a = c, and applying (2 3) implies b = c. Therefore, all three must be equal. Hence, indeed, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed by the entire group. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector. Since the field is F_3, there are three such vectors: 0*(1,1,1) = (0,0,0), 1*(1,1,1) = (1,1,1), and 2*(1,1,1) = (2,2,2). So the cardinality is 3. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check again. Suppose we have the vector (1,1,1). Applying any permutation would not change it, correct. But could there be another vector where, say, even though the entries are different, they are arranged in such a way that permuting doesn&#x27;t change the vector? For example, maybe if the entries are arranged symmetrically in some way. But over F_3, the entries are just elements of the field. The only way for a permutation not to change the vector is if all entries are equal. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so if you have two different entries, swapping them would result in a different vector, unless they are equal. 

Therefore, yes, the conclusion is that the fixed vectors are those with all entries equal. Hence, there are three such vectors. Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

But wait, let me think again. Maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing here. Let me rephrase the problem. The symmetric group S_3 acts by permuting the basis vectors. So when they say &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}&quot;, this is a permutation of the basis vectors, which induces a linear transformation on the vector space. So the action on a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is that σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. But wait, is that correct? Or is it that the permutation permutes the coefficients? 

Wait, no. If you have a permutation σ, then σ acts on the basis vectors, so σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, to compute σ ⋅ v, where v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, you have σ ⋅ v = a σ ⋅ e_1 + b σ ⋅ e_2 + c σ ⋅ e_3 = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in terms of coordinates, this would correspond to swapping the first and second coordinates. Similarly, a 3-cycle would cycle the coordinates. 

Therefore, the action on the vector v is equivalent to permuting its coordinates according to σ. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (a_{σ^{-1}(1)}, a_{σ^{-1}(2)}, a_{σ^{-1}(3)})? Wait, hold on. There&#x27;s a difference between left and right actions here. Let me clarify. 

Suppose we have a permutation σ, which is a bijection σ: {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3}. The action on the basis vectors is σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, if we have a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, then σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But when we express this in terms of the original basis, we need to write σ ⋅ v as a linear combination of e_1, e_2, e_3. So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in coordinates, the vector (a, b, c) becomes (b, a, c). Similarly, for a 3-cycle σ = (1 2 3), we have σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which in coordinates is (c, a, b). 

Therefore, the action of σ on the coordinates is given by permuting the coordinates according to the inverse of σ. Wait, let&#x27;s verify this. If σ = (1 2 3), then σ(1) = 2, σ(2) = 3, σ(3) = 1. So σ ⋅ e_1 = e_2, σ ⋅ e_2 = e_3, σ ⋅ e_3 = e_1. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which corresponds to the vector (c, a, b). 

But if we think of how permutations act on coordinates, if we have a permutation σ, the corresponding permutation of the coordinates is σ^{-1}. Because if you have a permutation σ, the coordinate representation of σ ⋅ v is (c, a, b) when σ is (1 2 3). Let me check with another example. Take σ = (1 2). Then σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (b, a, c). But σ^{-1} is also (1 2), since transpositions are self-inverse. So in this case, the coordinate permutation is indeed σ^{-1} acting on the coordinates. 

Therefore, in general, the action of σ on the vector v is given by permuting the coordinates according to σ^{-1}. But for our purposes, since we are considering all σ in S_3, and the group is closed under inverses, requiring that the vector is fixed under all σ in S_3 is equivalent to requiring that the vector is fixed under all permutations of its coordinates. 

Therefore, the vectors fixed by the S_3 action are exactly the vectors whose coordinates are invariant under any permutation. Therefore, as previously thought, such vectors must have all coordinates equal. Hence, the fixed vectors are (k, k, k) for k ∈ F_3, which gives three vectors. 

But let me confirm this with an example. Suppose we have a vector (1, 1, 1). Applying any permutation σ, we get (1, 1, 1) again. Similarly, (2, 2, 2) and (0, 0, 0). Are there any other vectors? Suppose we take (1, 1, 0). Applying the permutation (1 2 3) to this vector would cycle the coordinates, resulting in (0, 1, 1), which is different from (1, 1, 0). Therefore, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, (1, 2, 1). Applying the transposition (2 3) would give (1, 1, 2), which is different. 

Another test: consider (1, 2, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2), we get (2, 1, 0). Since 1 ≠ 2 in F_3, this vector isn&#x27;t fixed. 

Wait a minute, but in F_3, 2 is equal to -1, right? So 2 is distinct from 1. So indeed, unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a non-trivial combination where permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector. For example, if the entries are arranged in such a way that they are symmetric with respect to all permutations. But over F_3, the only way that permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector is if all entries are the same. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so unless all entries are equal, swapping two different entries would result in a different vector. 

Therefore, it&#x27;s confirmed that the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are precisely the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector, hence three vectors in total. 

But just to make sure, let&#x27;s think in terms of linear algebra. The fixed vectors under a group action form a subspace, called the invariant subspace. In this case, the fixed subspace under S_3. To find its dimension, we can use the concept of averaging over the group, but since we are over a finite field, we need to be careful. 

Alternatively, we can note that the action of S_3 is a permutation representation, and the fixed vectors are the trivial subrepresentation, which is one-dimensional if the field is algebraically closed and the characteristic doesn&#x27;t divide the group order. However, here the field is F_3, which has characteristic 3, and 3 divides the order of S_3 (which is 6). Therefore, Maschke&#x27;s theorem doesn&#x27;t apply, and the representation is not semisimple. 

But in our case, we are just looking for the vectors fixed by the entire group. Regardless of the structure of the representation, the fixed vectors can be found by solving the equations σ(v) = v for all σ ∈ S_3. 

But since S_3 is generated by transpositions, we can just consider the transpositions. Let&#x27;s take the transposition (1 2). For a vector (a, b, c) to be fixed by (1 2), we must have (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies a = b. Similarly, applying the transposition (1 3) gives (c, b, a) = (a, b, c), so a = c. Hence, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, even if we just consider the transpositions, we get that a = b = c. Therefore, only the vectors with all coordinates equal are fixed by S_3. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are three such vectors: (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). Hence, the cardinality is 3. 

But wait, hold on. Let me check once again. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then under any permutation, it remains (a, a, a). Therefore, these are fixed. Suppose there exists another vector fixed by all permutations. Then, since S_3 acts by permuting the coordinates, such a vector must have all coordinates equal. Therefore, the fixed subspace is indeed { (a, a, a) | a ∈ F_3 }, which has size 3. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

However, let me consider the possibility that maybe the problem is not about permuting the coordinates, but permuting the basis vectors. Wait, the problem says &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)} for all σ ∈ S_3&quot;. Therefore, the action on a general vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But in terms of coordinates with respect to the original basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}, this permutes the basis vectors, hence permuting the coefficients accordingly. For example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3. In terms of the original basis, this is b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. Therefore, the coordinates of σ ⋅ v are (b, a, c). 

Therefore, as before, to have σ ⋅ v = v for all σ ∈ S_3, the coordinates must satisfy that for any permutation of the coordinates, the vector remains the same. Therefore, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are those with all coordinates equal, so three vectors. 

But wait, maybe in the vector space over F_3, the equations a = b = c have only three solutions: a = 0,1,2. Therefore, the fixed vectors are indeed (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). 

Therefore, the cardinality is 3. 

So, after going through this reasoning, I think the answer is 3.

To determine the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field \(\Bbb F_3 = \{0, 1, 2\}\) that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group \(S_3\) on the basis \(\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}\), we need to find all vectors \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) such that \(\sigma \cdot v = v\) for every \(\sigma \in S_3\).

The action of a permutation \(\sigma \in S_3\) on a vector \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) permutes the basis vectors, resulting in the vector \(\sigma \cdot v = a e_{\sigma(1)} + b e_{\sigma(2)} + c e_{\sigma(3)}\). For \(v\) to be fixed by all permutations, the coefficients \(a, b, c\) must remain unchanged under any permutation of their indices.

This implies that \(a, b, c\) must be equal. Therefore, the fixed vectors are of the form \((k, k, k)\) where \(k \in \Bbb F_3\). The possible values for \(k\) are 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to the vectors \((0, 0, 0)\), \((1, 1, 1)\), and \((2, 2, 2)\).

Thus, the cardinality of the set of fixed vectors is 3.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field F_3 = {0, 1, 2} that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group S_3 on the basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}. The action is given by permuting the basis vectors according to the permutation σ. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a vector space V = F_3^3, and the symmetric group S_3 acts on the basis vectors by permuting their indices. For example, if σ is the permutation (1 2 3), then σ·e_1 = e_2, σ·e_2 = e_3, and σ·e_3 = e_1. This action extends linearly to the entire vector space. 

The question is asking for the number of vectors in V that are fixed by every element of S_3. That is, we need all vectors v ∈ V such that σ·v = v for every σ in S_3. 

Since S_3 is a group, it&#x27;s generated by its elements. So, instead of checking the condition for every σ in S_3, maybe I can check it for a set of generators of S_3. The symmetric group S_3 is generated by a transposition and a 3-cycle, for example, the transposition (1 2) and the 3-cycle (1 2 3). If a vector is fixed by these two permutations, it will be fixed by the entire group. 

But perhaps it&#x27;s easier to consider all permutations. Let me think.

First, let&#x27;s recall that a vector v in V can be written as v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, where a, b, c ∈ F_3. The action of S_3 on such a vector permutes the coefficients a, b, c according to the permutation of the basis vectors. For example, applying the permutation (1 2) to v gives (1 2)·v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. 

Therefore, for v to be fixed by every permutation, it must satisfy that for every σ ∈ S_3, the coefficients a, b, c are permuted among themselves without changing. That is, the coefficients must be invariant under any permutation of their indices. 

Therefore, the only way this can happen is if all the coefficients a, b, c are equal. For example, if a = b = c, then permuting them won&#x27;t change the vector. Conversely, if permuting the coefficients doesn&#x27;t change the vector, then all coefficients must be equal. 

So, the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are exactly the vectors of the form (k, k, k) where k ∈ F_3. Therefore, there are three such vectors: (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), and (2, 2, 2). 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check this. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then any permutation will just rearrange the entries, but since they are all the same, the vector remains the same. That seems correct. 

But is this the only case? Suppose a vector is not all the same entries. For example, take (1, 1, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2 3), which cycles the coordinates, we get (0, 1, 1). Since (1, 1, 0) ≠ (0, 1, 1) in F_3^3, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, a vector with two entries the same and one different, like (1, 1, 2), if we apply the transposition (1 2), it remains (1, 1, 2), but if we apply the transposition (1 3), it becomes (2, 1, 1), which is different. Therefore, unless all entries are equal, the vector is not fixed by all permutations. 

But wait, in F_3, (1,1,2) when transposed (1 3) becomes (2,1,1). Since in vectors over F_3, the order matters even if the entries are in a field. So unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. Hence, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). So that&#x27;s three vectors. But wait, is that all? Let me check with another example. Suppose the vector is (0,0,0). Obviously, permuting does nothing. If the vector is (1,1,1), same thing. (2,2,2) as well. 

But maybe there&#x27;s another possibility. Suppose we have a vector that is fixed even though the entries are not all equal. For instance, in some cases, maybe scaling by the field elements could allow more fixed vectors. Wait, but over F_3, the scalars are 0, 1, 2. If the entries are not all the same, permuting them would require that the entries are equal. For example, suppose we have a vector (a, b, c). If applying the permutation (1 2) leaves it fixed, then (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies that a = b. Similarly, applying (1 3) implies a = c, and applying (2 3) implies b = c. Therefore, all three must be equal. Hence, indeed, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed by the entire group. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector. Since the field is F_3, there are three such vectors: 0*(1,1,1) = (0,0,0), 1*(1,1,1) = (1,1,1), and 2*(1,1,1) = (2,2,2). So the cardinality is 3. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check again. Suppose we have the vector (1,1,1). Applying any permutation would not change it, correct. But could there be another vector where, say, even though the entries are different, they are arranged in such a way that permuting doesn&#x27;t change the vector? For example, maybe if the entries are arranged symmetrically in some way. But over F_3, the entries are just elements of the field. The only way for a permutation not to change the vector is if all entries are equal. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so if you have two different entries, swapping them would result in a different vector, unless they are equal. 

Therefore, yes, the conclusion is that the fixed vectors are those with all entries equal. Hence, there are three such vectors. Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

But wait, let me think again. Maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing here. Let me rephrase the problem. The symmetric group S_3 acts by permuting the basis vectors. So when they say &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}&quot;, this is a permutation of the basis vectors, which induces a linear transformation on the vector space. So the action on a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is that σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. But wait, is that correct? Or is it that the permutation permutes the coefficients? 

Wait, no. If you have a permutation σ, then σ acts on the basis vectors, so σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, to compute σ ⋅ v, where v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, you have σ ⋅ v = a σ ⋅ e_1 + b σ ⋅ e_2 + c σ ⋅ e_3 = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in terms of coordinates, this would correspond to swapping the first and second coordinates. Similarly, a 3-cycle would cycle the coordinates. 

Therefore, the action on the vector v is equivalent to permuting its coordinates according to σ. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (a_{σ^{-1}(1)}, a_{σ^{-1}(2)}, a_{σ^{-1}(3)})? Wait, hold on. There&#x27;s a difference between left and right actions here. Let me clarify. 

Suppose we have a permutation σ, which is a bijection σ: {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3}. The action on the basis vectors is σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, if we have a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, then σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But when we express this in terms of the original basis, we need to write σ ⋅ v as a linear combination of e_1, e_2, e_3. So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in coordinates, the vector (a, b, c) becomes (b, a, c). Similarly, for a 3-cycle σ = (1 2 3), we have σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which in coordinates is (c, a, b). 

Therefore, the action of σ on the coordinates is given by permuting the coordinates according to the inverse of σ. Wait, let&#x27;s verify this. If σ = (1 2 3), then σ(1) = 2, σ(2) = 3, σ(3) = 1. So σ ⋅ e_1 = e_2, σ ⋅ e_2 = e_3, σ ⋅ e_3 = e_1. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which corresponds to the vector (c, a, b). 

But if we think of how permutations act on coordinates, if we have a permutation σ, the corresponding permutation of the coordinates is σ^{-1}. Because if you have a permutation σ, the coordinate representation of σ ⋅ v is (c, a, b) when σ is (1 2 3). Let me check with another example. Take σ = (1 2). Then σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (b, a, c). But σ^{-1} is also (1 2), since transpositions are self-inverse. So in this case, the coordinate permutation is indeed σ^{-1} acting on the coordinates. 

Therefore, in general, the action of σ on the vector v is given by permuting the coordinates according to σ^{-1}. But for our purposes, since we are considering all σ in S_3, and the group is closed under inverses, requiring that the vector is fixed under all σ in S_3 is equivalent to requiring that the vector is fixed under all permutations of its coordinates. 

Therefore, the vectors fixed by the S_3 action are exactly the vectors whose coordinates are invariant under any permutation. Therefore, as previously thought, such vectors must have all coordinates equal. Hence, the fixed vectors are (k, k, k) for k ∈ F_3, which gives three vectors. 

But let me confirm this with an example. Suppose we have a vector (1, 1, 1). Applying any permutation σ, we get (1, 1, 1) again. Similarly, (2, 2, 2) and (0, 0, 0). Are there any other vectors? Suppose we take (1, 1, 0). Applying the permutation (1 2 3) to this vector would cycle the coordinates, resulting in (0, 1, 1), which is different from (1, 1, 0). Therefore, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, (1, 2, 1). Applying the transposition (2 3) would give (1, 1, 2), which is different. 

Another test: consider (1, 2, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2), we get (2, 1, 0). Since 1 ≠ 2 in F_3, this vector isn&#x27;t fixed. 

Wait a minute, but in F_3, 2 is equal to -1, right? So 2 is distinct from 1. So indeed, unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a non-trivial combination where permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector. For example, if the entries are arranged in such a way that they are symmetric with respect to all permutations. But over F_3, the only way that permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector is if all entries are the same. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so unless all entries are equal, swapping two different entries would result in a different vector. 

Therefore, it&#x27;s confirmed that the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are precisely the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector, hence three vectors in total. 

But just to make sure, let&#x27;s think in terms of linear algebra. The fixed vectors under a group action form a subspace, called the invariant subspace. In this case, the fixed subspace under S_3. To find its dimension, we can use the concept of averaging over the group, but since we are over a finite field, we need to be careful. 

Alternatively, we can note that the action of S_3 is a permutation representation, and the fixed vectors are the trivial subrepresentation, which is one-dimensional if the field is algebraically closed and the characteristic doesn&#x27;t divide the group order. However, here the field is F_3, which has characteristic 3, and 3 divides the order of S_3 (which is 6). Therefore, Maschke&#x27;s theorem doesn&#x27;t apply, and the representation is not semisimple. 

But in our case, we are just looking for the vectors fixed by the entire group. Regardless of the structure of the representation, the fixed vectors can be found by solving the equations σ(v) = v for all σ ∈ S_3. 

But since S_3 is generated by transpositions, we can just consider the transpositions. Let&#x27;s take the transposition (1 2). For a vector (a, b, c) to be fixed by (1 2), we must have (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies a = b. Similarly, applying the transposition (1 3) gives (c, b, a) = (a, b, c), so a = c. Hence, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, even if we just consider the transpositions, we get that a = b = c. Therefore, only the vectors with all coordinates equal are fixed by S_3. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are three such vectors: (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). Hence, the cardinality is 3. 

But wait, hold on. Let me check once again. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then under any permutation, it remains (a, a, a). Therefore, these are fixed. Suppose there exists another vector fixed by all permutations. Then, since S_3 acts by permuting the coordinates, such a vector must have all coordinates equal. Therefore, the fixed subspace is indeed { (a, a, a) | a ∈ F_3 }, which has size 3. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

However, let me consider the possibility that maybe the problem is not about permuting the coordinates, but permuting the basis vectors. Wait, the problem says &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)} for all σ ∈ S_3&quot;. Therefore, the action on a general vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But in terms of coordinates with respect to the original basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}, this permutes the basis vectors, hence permuting the coefficients accordingly. For example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3. In terms of the original basis, this is b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. Therefore, the coordinates of σ ⋅ v are (b, a, c). 

Therefore, as before, to have σ ⋅ v = v for all σ ∈ S_3, the coordinates must satisfy that for any permutation of the coordinates, the vector remains the same. Therefore, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are those with all coordinates equal, so three vectors. 

But wait, maybe in the vector space over F_3, the equations a = b = c have only three solutions: a = 0,1,2. Therefore, the fixed vectors are indeed (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). 

Therefore, the cardinality is 3. 

So, after going through this reasoning, I think the answer is 3. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{3}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field \(\Bbb F_3 = \{0, 1, 2\}\) that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group \(S_3\) on the basis \(\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}\), we need to find all vectors \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) such that \(\sigma \cdot v = v\) for every \(\sigma \in S_3\).

The action of a permutation \(\sigma \in S_3\) on a vector \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) permutes the basis vectors, resulting in the vector \(\sigma \cdot v = a e_{\sigma(1)} + b e_{\sigma(2)} + c e_{\sigma(3)}\). For \(v\) to be fixed by all permutations, the coefficients \(a, b, c\) must remain unchanged under any permutation of their indices.

This implies that \(a, b, c\) must be equal. Therefore, the fixed vectors are of the form \((k, k, k)\) where \(k \in \Bbb F_3\). The possible values for \(k\) are 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to the vectors \((0, 0, 0)\), \((1, 1, 1)\), and \((2, 2, 2)\).

Thus, the cardinality of the set of fixed vectors is 3.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field F_3 = {0, 1, 2} that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group S_3 on the basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}. The action is given by permuting the basis vectors according to the permutation σ. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a vector space V = F_3^3, and the symmetric group S_3 acts on the basis vectors by permuting their indices. For example, if σ is the permutation (1 2 3), then σ·e_1 = e_2, σ·e_2 = e_3, and σ·e_3 = e_1. This action extends linearly to the entire vector space. 

The question is asking for the number of vectors in V that are fixed by every element of S_3. That is, we need all vectors v ∈ V such that σ·v = v for every σ in S_3. 

Since S_3 is a group, it&#x27;s generated by its elements. So, instead of checking the condition for every σ in S_3, maybe I can check it for a set of generators of S_3. The symmetric group S_3 is generated by a transposition and a 3-cycle, for example, the transposition (1 2) and the 3-cycle (1 2 3). If a vector is fixed by these two permutations, it will be fixed by the entire group. 

But perhaps it&#x27;s easier to consider all permutations. Let me think.

First, let&#x27;s recall that a vector v in V can be written as v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, where a, b, c ∈ F_3. The action of S_3 on such a vector permutes the coefficients a, b, c according to the permutation of the basis vectors. For example, applying the permutation (1 2) to v gives (1 2)·v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. 

Therefore, for v to be fixed by every permutation, it must satisfy that for every σ ∈ S_3, the coefficients a, b, c are permuted among themselves without changing. That is, the coefficients must be invariant under any permutation of their indices. 

Therefore, the only way this can happen is if all the coefficients a, b, c are equal. For example, if a = b = c, then permuting them won&#x27;t change the vector. Conversely, if permuting the coefficients doesn&#x27;t change the vector, then all coefficients must be equal. 

So, the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are exactly the vectors of the form (k, k, k) where k ∈ F_3. Therefore, there are three such vectors: (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), and (2, 2, 2). 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check this. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then any permutation will just rearrange the entries, but since they are all the same, the vector remains the same. That seems correct. 

But is this the only case? Suppose a vector is not all the same entries. For example, take (1, 1, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2 3), which cycles the coordinates, we get (0, 1, 1). Since (1, 1, 0) ≠ (0, 1, 1) in F_3^3, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, a vector with two entries the same and one different, like (1, 1, 2), if we apply the transposition (1 2), it remains (1, 1, 2), but if we apply the transposition (1 3), it becomes (2, 1, 1), which is different. Therefore, unless all entries are equal, the vector is not fixed by all permutations. 

But wait, in F_3, (1,1,2) when transposed (1 3) becomes (2,1,1). Since in vectors over F_3, the order matters even if the entries are in a field. So unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. Hence, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). So that&#x27;s three vectors. But wait, is that all? Let me check with another example. Suppose the vector is (0,0,0). Obviously, permuting does nothing. If the vector is (1,1,1), same thing. (2,2,2) as well. 

But maybe there&#x27;s another possibility. Suppose we have a vector that is fixed even though the entries are not all equal. For instance, in some cases, maybe scaling by the field elements could allow more fixed vectors. Wait, but over F_3, the scalars are 0, 1, 2. If the entries are not all the same, permuting them would require that the entries are equal. For example, suppose we have a vector (a, b, c). If applying the permutation (1 2) leaves it fixed, then (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies that a = b. Similarly, applying (1 3) implies a = c, and applying (2 3) implies b = c. Therefore, all three must be equal. Hence, indeed, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed by the entire group. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector. Since the field is F_3, there are three such vectors: 0*(1,1,1) = (0,0,0), 1*(1,1,1) = (1,1,1), and 2*(1,1,1) = (2,2,2). So the cardinality is 3. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check again. Suppose we have the vector (1,1,1). Applying any permutation would not change it, correct. But could there be another vector where, say, even though the entries are different, they are arranged in such a way that permuting doesn&#x27;t change the vector? For example, maybe if the entries are arranged symmetrically in some way. But over F_3, the entries are just elements of the field. The only way for a permutation not to change the vector is if all entries are equal. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so if you have two different entries, swapping them would result in a different vector, unless they are equal. 

Therefore, yes, the conclusion is that the fixed vectors are those with all entries equal. Hence, there are three such vectors. Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

But wait, let me think again. Maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing here. Let me rephrase the problem. The symmetric group S_3 acts by permuting the basis vectors. So when they say &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}&quot;, this is a permutation of the basis vectors, which induces a linear transformation on the vector space. So the action on a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is that σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. But wait, is that correct? Or is it that the permutation permutes the coefficients? 

Wait, no. If you have a permutation σ, then σ acts on the basis vectors, so σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, to compute σ ⋅ v, where v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, you have σ ⋅ v = a σ ⋅ e_1 + b σ ⋅ e_2 + c σ ⋅ e_3 = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in terms of coordinates, this would correspond to swapping the first and second coordinates. Similarly, a 3-cycle would cycle the coordinates. 

Therefore, the action on the vector v is equivalent to permuting its coordinates according to σ. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (a_{σ^{-1}(1)}, a_{σ^{-1}(2)}, a_{σ^{-1}(3)})? Wait, hold on. There&#x27;s a difference between left and right actions here. Let me clarify. 

Suppose we have a permutation σ, which is a bijection σ: {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3}. The action on the basis vectors is σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, if we have a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, then σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But when we express this in terms of the original basis, we need to write σ ⋅ v as a linear combination of e_1, e_2, e_3. So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in coordinates, the vector (a, b, c) becomes (b, a, c). Similarly, for a 3-cycle σ = (1 2 3), we have σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which in coordinates is (c, a, b). 

Therefore, the action of σ on the coordinates is given by permuting the coordinates according to the inverse of σ. Wait, let&#x27;s verify this. If σ = (1 2 3), then σ(1) = 2, σ(2) = 3, σ(3) = 1. So σ ⋅ e_1 = e_2, σ ⋅ e_2 = e_3, σ ⋅ e_3 = e_1. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which corresponds to the vector (c, a, b). 

But if we think of how permutations act on coordinates, if we have a permutation σ, the corresponding permutation of the coordinates is σ^{-1}. Because if you have a permutation σ, the coordinate representation of σ ⋅ v is (c, a, b) when σ is (1 2 3). Let me check with another example. Take σ = (1 2). Then σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (b, a, c). But σ^{-1} is also (1 2), since transpositions are self-inverse. So in this case, the coordinate permutation is indeed σ^{-1} acting on the coordinates. 

Therefore, in general, the action of σ on the vector v is given by permuting the coordinates according to σ^{-1}. But for our purposes, since we are considering all σ in S_3, and the group is closed under inverses, requiring that the vector is fixed under all σ in S_3 is equivalent to requiring that the vector is fixed under all permutations of its coordinates. 

Therefore, the vectors fixed by the S_3 action are exactly the vectors whose coordinates are invariant under any permutation. Therefore, as previously thought, such vectors must have all coordinates equal. Hence, the fixed vectors are (k, k, k) for k ∈ F_3, which gives three vectors. 

But let me confirm this with an example. Suppose we have a vector (1, 1, 1). Applying any permutation σ, we get (1, 1, 1) again. Similarly, (2, 2, 2) and (0, 0, 0). Are there any other vectors? Suppose we take (1, 1, 0). Applying the permutation (1 2 3) to this vector would cycle the coordinates, resulting in (0, 1, 1), which is different from (1, 1, 0). Therefore, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, (1, 2, 1). Applying the transposition (2 3) would give (1, 1, 2), which is different. 

Another test: consider (1, 2, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2), we get (2, 1, 0). Since 1 ≠ 2 in F_3, this vector isn&#x27;t fixed. 

Wait a minute, but in F_3, 2 is equal to -1, right? So 2 is distinct from 1. So indeed, unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a non-trivial combination where permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector. For example, if the entries are arranged in such a way that they are symmetric with respect to all permutations. But over F_3, the only way that permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector is if all entries are the same. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so unless all entries are equal, swapping two different entries would result in a different vector. 

Therefore, it&#x27;s confirmed that the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are precisely the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector, hence three vectors in total. 

But just to make sure, let&#x27;s think in terms of linear algebra. The fixed vectors under a group action form a subspace, called the invariant subspace. In this case, the fixed subspace under S_3. To find its dimension, we can use the concept of averaging over the group, but since we are over a finite field, we need to be careful. 

Alternatively, we can note that the action of S_3 is a permutation representation, and the fixed vectors are the trivial subrepresentation, which is one-dimensional if the field is algebraically closed and the characteristic doesn&#x27;t divide the group order. However, here the field is F_3, which has characteristic 3, and 3 divides the order of S_3 (which is 6). Therefore, Maschke&#x27;s theorem doesn&#x27;t apply, and the representation is not semisimple. 

But in our case, we are just looking for the vectors fixed by the entire group. Regardless of the structure of the representation, the fixed vectors can be found by solving the equations σ(v) = v for all σ ∈ S_3. 

But since S_3 is generated by transpositions, we can just consider the transpositions. Let&#x27;s take the transposition (1 2). For a vector (a, b, c) to be fixed by (1 2), we must have (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies a = b. Similarly, applying the transposition (1 3) gives (c, b, a) = (a, b, c), so a = c. Hence, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, even if we just consider the transpositions, we get that a = b = c. Therefore, only the vectors with all coordinates equal are fixed by S_3. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are three such vectors: (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). Hence, the cardinality is 3. 

But wait, hold on. Let me check once again. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then under any permutation, it remains (a, a, a). Therefore, these are fixed. Suppose there exists another vector fixed by all permutations. Then, since S_3 acts by permuting the coordinates, such a vector must have all coordinates equal. Therefore, the fixed subspace is indeed { (a, a, a) | a ∈ F_3 }, which has size 3. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

However, let me consider the possibility that maybe the problem is not about permuting the coordinates, but permuting the basis vectors. Wait, the problem says &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)} for all σ ∈ S_3&quot;. Therefore, the action on a general vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But in terms of coordinates with respect to the original basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}, this permutes the basis vectors, hence permuting the coefficients accordingly. For example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3. In terms of the original basis, this is b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. Therefore, the coordinates of σ ⋅ v are (b, a, c). 

Therefore, as before, to have σ ⋅ v = v for all σ ∈ S_3, the coordinates must satisfy that for any permutation of the coordinates, the vector remains the same. Therefore, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are those with all coordinates equal, so three vectors. 

But wait, maybe in the vector space over F_3, the equations a = b = c have only three solutions: a = 0,1,2. Therefore, the fixed vectors are indeed (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). 

Therefore, the cardinality is 3. 

So, after going through this reasoning, I think the answer is 3. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{3}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field \(\Bbb F_3 = \{0, 1, 2\}\) that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group \(S_3\) on the basis \(\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}\), we need to find all vectors \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) such that \(\sigma \cdot v = v\) for every \(\sigma \in S_3\).

The action of a permutation \(\sigma \in S_3\) on a vector \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) permutes the basis vectors, resulting in the vector \(\sigma \cdot v = a e_{\sigma(1)} + b e_{\sigma(2)} + c e_{\sigma(3)}\). For \(v\) to be fixed by all permutations, the coefficients \(a, b, c\) must remain unchanged under any permutation of their indices.

This implies that \(a, b, c\) must be equal. Therefore, the fixed vectors are of the form \((k, k, k)\) where \(k \in \Bbb F_3\). The possible values for \(k\) are 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to the vectors \((0, 0, 0)\), \((1, 1, 1)\), and \((2, 2, 2)\).

Thus, the cardinality of the set of fixed vectors is 3.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field F_3 = {0, 1, 2} that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group S_3 on the basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}. The action is given by permuting the basis vectors according to the permutation σ. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a vector space V = F_3^3, and the symmetric group S_3 acts on the basis vectors by permuting their indices. For example, if σ is the permutation (1 2 3), then σ·e_1 = e_2, σ·e_2 = e_3, and σ·e_3 = e_1. This action extends linearly to the entire vector space. 

The question is asking for the number of vectors in V that are fixed by every element of S_3. That is, we need all vectors v ∈ V such that σ·v = v for every σ in S_3. 

Since S_3 is a group, it&#x27;s generated by its elements. So, instead of checking the condition for every σ in S_3, maybe I can check it for a set of generators of S_3. The symmetric group S_3 is generated by a transposition and a 3-cycle, for example, the transposition (1 2) and the 3-cycle (1 2 3). If a vector is fixed by these two permutations, it will be fixed by the entire group. 

But perhaps it&#x27;s easier to consider all permutations. Let me think.

First, let&#x27;s recall that a vector v in V can be written as v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, where a, b, c ∈ F_3. The action of S_3 on such a vector permutes the coefficients a, b, c according to the permutation of the basis vectors. For example, applying the permutation (1 2) to v gives (1 2)·v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. 

Therefore, for v to be fixed by every permutation, it must satisfy that for every σ ∈ S_3, the coefficients a, b, c are permuted among themselves without changing. That is, the coefficients must be invariant under any permutation of their indices. 

Therefore, the only way this can happen is if all the coefficients a, b, c are equal. For example, if a = b = c, then permuting them won&#x27;t change the vector. Conversely, if permuting the coefficients doesn&#x27;t change the vector, then all coefficients must be equal. 

So, the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are exactly the vectors of the form (k, k, k) where k ∈ F_3. Therefore, there are three such vectors: (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), and (2, 2, 2). 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check this. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then any permutation will just rearrange the entries, but since they are all the same, the vector remains the same. That seems correct. 

But is this the only case? Suppose a vector is not all the same entries. For example, take (1, 1, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2 3), which cycles the coordinates, we get (0, 1, 1). Since (1, 1, 0) ≠ (0, 1, 1) in F_3^3, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, a vector with two entries the same and one different, like (1, 1, 2), if we apply the transposition (1 2), it remains (1, 1, 2), but if we apply the transposition (1 3), it becomes (2, 1, 1), which is different. Therefore, unless all entries are equal, the vector is not fixed by all permutations. 

But wait, in F_3, (1,1,2) when transposed (1 3) becomes (2,1,1). Since in vectors over F_3, the order matters even if the entries are in a field. So unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. Hence, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). So that&#x27;s three vectors. But wait, is that all? Let me check with another example. Suppose the vector is (0,0,0). Obviously, permuting does nothing. If the vector is (1,1,1), same thing. (2,2,2) as well. 

But maybe there&#x27;s another possibility. Suppose we have a vector that is fixed even though the entries are not all equal. For instance, in some cases, maybe scaling by the field elements could allow more fixed vectors. Wait, but over F_3, the scalars are 0, 1, 2. If the entries are not all the same, permuting them would require that the entries are equal. For example, suppose we have a vector (a, b, c). If applying the permutation (1 2) leaves it fixed, then (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies that a = b. Similarly, applying (1 3) implies a = c, and applying (2 3) implies b = c. Therefore, all three must be equal. Hence, indeed, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed by the entire group. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector. Since the field is F_3, there are three such vectors: 0*(1,1,1) = (0,0,0), 1*(1,1,1) = (1,1,1), and 2*(1,1,1) = (2,2,2). So the cardinality is 3. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check again. Suppose we have the vector (1,1,1). Applying any permutation would not change it, correct. But could there be another vector where, say, even though the entries are different, they are arranged in such a way that permuting doesn&#x27;t change the vector? For example, maybe if the entries are arranged symmetrically in some way. But over F_3, the entries are just elements of the field. The only way for a permutation not to change the vector is if all entries are equal. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so if you have two different entries, swapping them would result in a different vector, unless they are equal. 

Therefore, yes, the conclusion is that the fixed vectors are those with all entries equal. Hence, there are three such vectors. Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

But wait, let me think again. Maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing here. Let me rephrase the problem. The symmetric group S_3 acts by permuting the basis vectors. So when they say &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}&quot;, this is a permutation of the basis vectors, which induces a linear transformation on the vector space. So the action on a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is that σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. But wait, is that correct? Or is it that the permutation permutes the coefficients? 

Wait, no. If you have a permutation σ, then σ acts on the basis vectors, so σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, to compute σ ⋅ v, where v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, you have σ ⋅ v = a σ ⋅ e_1 + b σ ⋅ e_2 + c σ ⋅ e_3 = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in terms of coordinates, this would correspond to swapping the first and second coordinates. Similarly, a 3-cycle would cycle the coordinates. 

Therefore, the action on the vector v is equivalent to permuting its coordinates according to σ. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (a_{σ^{-1}(1)}, a_{σ^{-1}(2)}, a_{σ^{-1}(3)})? Wait, hold on. There&#x27;s a difference between left and right actions here. Let me clarify. 

Suppose we have a permutation σ, which is a bijection σ: {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3}. The action on the basis vectors is σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, if we have a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, then σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But when we express this in terms of the original basis, we need to write σ ⋅ v as a linear combination of e_1, e_2, e_3. So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in coordinates, the vector (a, b, c) becomes (b, a, c). Similarly, for a 3-cycle σ = (1 2 3), we have σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which in coordinates is (c, a, b). 

Therefore, the action of σ on the coordinates is given by permuting the coordinates according to the inverse of σ. Wait, let&#x27;s verify this. If σ = (1 2 3), then σ(1) = 2, σ(2) = 3, σ(3) = 1. So σ ⋅ e_1 = e_2, σ ⋅ e_2 = e_3, σ ⋅ e_3 = e_1. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which corresponds to the vector (c, a, b). 

But if we think of how permutations act on coordinates, if we have a permutation σ, the corresponding permutation of the coordinates is σ^{-1}. Because if you have a permutation σ, the coordinate representation of σ ⋅ v is (c, a, b) when σ is (1 2 3). Let me check with another example. Take σ = (1 2). Then σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (b, a, c). But σ^{-1} is also (1 2), since transpositions are self-inverse. So in this case, the coordinate permutation is indeed σ^{-1} acting on the coordinates. 

Therefore, in general, the action of σ on the vector v is given by permuting the coordinates according to σ^{-1}. But for our purposes, since we are considering all σ in S_3, and the group is closed under inverses, requiring that the vector is fixed under all σ in S_3 is equivalent to requiring that the vector is fixed under all permutations of its coordinates. 

Therefore, the vectors fixed by the S_3 action are exactly the vectors whose coordinates are invariant under any permutation. Therefore, as previously thought, such vectors must have all coordinates equal. Hence, the fixed vectors are (k, k, k) for k ∈ F_3, which gives three vectors. 

But let me confirm this with an example. Suppose we have a vector (1, 1, 1). Applying any permutation σ, we get (1, 1, 1) again. Similarly, (2, 2, 2) and (0, 0, 0). Are there any other vectors? Suppose we take (1, 1, 0). Applying the permutation (1 2 3) to this vector would cycle the coordinates, resulting in (0, 1, 1), which is different from (1, 1, 0). Therefore, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, (1, 2, 1). Applying the transposition (2 3) would give (1, 1, 2), which is different. 

Another test: consider (1, 2, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2), we get (2, 1, 0). Since 1 ≠ 2 in F_3, this vector isn&#x27;t fixed. 

Wait a minute, but in F_3, 2 is equal to -1, right? So 2 is distinct from 1. So indeed, unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a non-trivial combination where permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector. For example, if the entries are arranged in such a way that they are symmetric with respect to all permutations. But over F_3, the only way that permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector is if all entries are the same. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so unless all entries are equal, swapping two different entries would result in a different vector. 

Therefore, it&#x27;s confirmed that the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are precisely the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector, hence three vectors in total. 

But just to make sure, let&#x27;s think in terms of linear algebra. The fixed vectors under a group action form a subspace, called the invariant subspace. In this case, the fixed subspace under S_3. To find its dimension, we can use the concept of averaging over the group, but since we are over a finite field, we need to be careful. 

Alternatively, we can note that the action of S_3 is a permutation representation, and the fixed vectors are the trivial subrepresentation, which is one-dimensional if the field is algebraically closed and the characteristic doesn&#x27;t divide the group order. However, here the field is F_3, which has characteristic 3, and 3 divides the order of S_3 (which is 6). Therefore, Maschke&#x27;s theorem doesn&#x27;t apply, and the representation is not semisimple. 

But in our case, we are just looking for the vectors fixed by the entire group. Regardless of the structure of the representation, the fixed vectors can be found by solving the equations σ(v) = v for all σ ∈ S_3. 

But since S_3 is generated by transpositions, we can just consider the transpositions. Let&#x27;s take the transposition (1 2). For a vector (a, b, c) to be fixed by (1 2), we must have (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies a = b. Similarly, applying the transposition (1 3) gives (c, b, a) = (a, b, c), so a = c. Hence, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, even if we just consider the transpositions, we get that a = b = c. Therefore, only the vectors with all coordinates equal are fixed by S_3. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are three such vectors: (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). Hence, the cardinality is 3. 

But wait, hold on. Let me check once again. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then under any permutation, it remains (a, a, a). Therefore, these are fixed. Suppose there exists another vector fixed by all permutations. Then, since S_3 acts by permuting the coordinates, such a vector must have all coordinates equal. Therefore, the fixed subspace is indeed { (a, a, a) | a ∈ F_3 }, which has size 3. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

However, let me consider the possibility that maybe the problem is not about permuting the coordinates, but permuting the basis vectors. Wait, the problem says &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)} for all σ ∈ S_3&quot;. Therefore, the action on a general vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But in terms of coordinates with respect to the original basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}, this permutes the basis vectors, hence permuting the coefficients accordingly. For example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3. In terms of the original basis, this is b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. Therefore, the coordinates of σ ⋅ v are (b, a, c). 

Therefore, as before, to have σ ⋅ v = v for all σ ∈ S_3, the coordinates must satisfy that for any permutation of the coordinates, the vector remains the same. Therefore, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are those with all coordinates equal, so three vectors. 

But wait, maybe in the vector space over F_3, the equations a = b = c have only three solutions: a = 0,1,2. Therefore, the fixed vectors are indeed (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). 

Therefore, the cardinality is 3. 

So, after going through this reasoning, I think the answer is 3.

To determine the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field \(\Bbb F_3 = \{0, 1, 2\}\) that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group \(S_3\) on the basis \(\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}\), we need to find all vectors \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) such that \(\sigma \cdot v = v\) for every \(\sigma \in S_3\).

The action of a permutation \(\sigma \in S_3\) on a vector \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) permutes the basis vectors, resulting in the vector \(\sigma \cdot v = a e_{\sigma(1)} + b e_{\sigma(2)} + c e_{\sigma(3)}\). For \(v\) to be fixed by all permutations, the coefficients \(a, b, c\) must remain unchanged under any permutation of their indices.

This implies that \(a, b, c\) must be equal. Therefore, the fixed vectors are of the form \((k, k, k)\) where \(k \in \Bbb F_3\). The possible values for \(k\) are 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to the vectors \((0, 0, 0)\), \((1, 1, 1)\), and \((2, 2, 2)\).

Thus, the cardinality of the set of fixed vectors is 3.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field F_3 = {0, 1, 2} that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group S_3 on the basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}. The action is given by permuting the basis vectors according to the permutation σ. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a vector space V = F_3^3, and the symmetric group S_3 acts on the basis vectors by permuting their indices. For example, if σ is the permutation (1 2 3), then σ·e_1 = e_2, σ·e_2 = e_3, and σ·e_3 = e_1. This action extends linearly to the entire vector space. 

The question is asking for the number of vectors in V that are fixed by every element of S_3. That is, we need all vectors v ∈ V such that σ·v = v for every σ in S_3. 

Since S_3 is a group, it&#x27;s generated by its elements. So, instead of checking the condition for every σ in S_3, maybe I can check it for a set of generators of S_3. The symmetric group S_3 is generated by a transposition and a 3-cycle, for example, the transposition (1 2) and the 3-cycle (1 2 3). If a vector is fixed by these two permutations, it will be fixed by the entire group. 

But perhaps it&#x27;s easier to consider all permutations. Let me think.

First, let&#x27;s recall that a vector v in V can be written as v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, where a, b, c ∈ F_3. The action of S_3 on such a vector permutes the coefficients a, b, c according to the permutation of the basis vectors. For example, applying the permutation (1 2) to v gives (1 2)·v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. 

Therefore, for v to be fixed by every permutation, it must satisfy that for every σ ∈ S_3, the coefficients a, b, c are permuted among themselves without changing. That is, the coefficients must be invariant under any permutation of their indices. 

Therefore, the only way this can happen is if all the coefficients a, b, c are equal. For example, if a = b = c, then permuting them won&#x27;t change the vector. Conversely, if permuting the coefficients doesn&#x27;t change the vector, then all coefficients must be equal. 

So, the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are exactly the vectors of the form (k, k, k) where k ∈ F_3. Therefore, there are three such vectors: (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), and (2, 2, 2). 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check this. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then any permutation will just rearrange the entries, but since they are all the same, the vector remains the same. That seems correct. 

But is this the only case? Suppose a vector is not all the same entries. For example, take (1, 1, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2 3), which cycles the coordinates, we get (0, 1, 1). Since (1, 1, 0) ≠ (0, 1, 1) in F_3^3, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, a vector with two entries the same and one different, like (1, 1, 2), if we apply the transposition (1 2), it remains (1, 1, 2), but if we apply the transposition (1 3), it becomes (2, 1, 1), which is different. Therefore, unless all entries are equal, the vector is not fixed by all permutations. 

But wait, in F_3, (1,1,2) when transposed (1 3) becomes (2,1,1). Since in vectors over F_3, the order matters even if the entries are in a field. So unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. Hence, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). So that&#x27;s three vectors. But wait, is that all? Let me check with another example. Suppose the vector is (0,0,0). Obviously, permuting does nothing. If the vector is (1,1,1), same thing. (2,2,2) as well. 

But maybe there&#x27;s another possibility. Suppose we have a vector that is fixed even though the entries are not all equal. For instance, in some cases, maybe scaling by the field elements could allow more fixed vectors. Wait, but over F_3, the scalars are 0, 1, 2. If the entries are not all the same, permuting them would require that the entries are equal. For example, suppose we have a vector (a, b, c). If applying the permutation (1 2) leaves it fixed, then (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies that a = b. Similarly, applying (1 3) implies a = c, and applying (2 3) implies b = c. Therefore, all three must be equal. Hence, indeed, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed by the entire group. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector. Since the field is F_3, there are three such vectors: 0*(1,1,1) = (0,0,0), 1*(1,1,1) = (1,1,1), and 2*(1,1,1) = (2,2,2). So the cardinality is 3. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check again. Suppose we have the vector (1,1,1). Applying any permutation would not change it, correct. But could there be another vector where, say, even though the entries are different, they are arranged in such a way that permuting doesn&#x27;t change the vector? For example, maybe if the entries are arranged symmetrically in some way. But over F_3, the entries are just elements of the field. The only way for a permutation not to change the vector is if all entries are equal. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so if you have two different entries, swapping them would result in a different vector, unless they are equal. 

Therefore, yes, the conclusion is that the fixed vectors are those with all entries equal. Hence, there are three such vectors. Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

But wait, let me think again. Maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing here. Let me rephrase the problem. The symmetric group S_3 acts by permuting the basis vectors. So when they say &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}&quot;, this is a permutation of the basis vectors, which induces a linear transformation on the vector space. So the action on a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is that σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. But wait, is that correct? Or is it that the permutation permutes the coefficients? 

Wait, no. If you have a permutation σ, then σ acts on the basis vectors, so σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, to compute σ ⋅ v, where v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, you have σ ⋅ v = a σ ⋅ e_1 + b σ ⋅ e_2 + c σ ⋅ e_3 = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in terms of coordinates, this would correspond to swapping the first and second coordinates. Similarly, a 3-cycle would cycle the coordinates. 

Therefore, the action on the vector v is equivalent to permuting its coordinates according to σ. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (a_{σ^{-1}(1)}, a_{σ^{-1}(2)}, a_{σ^{-1}(3)})? Wait, hold on. There&#x27;s a difference between left and right actions here. Let me clarify. 

Suppose we have a permutation σ, which is a bijection σ: {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3}. The action on the basis vectors is σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, if we have a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, then σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But when we express this in terms of the original basis, we need to write σ ⋅ v as a linear combination of e_1, e_2, e_3. So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in coordinates, the vector (a, b, c) becomes (b, a, c). Similarly, for a 3-cycle σ = (1 2 3), we have σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which in coordinates is (c, a, b). 

Therefore, the action of σ on the coordinates is given by permuting the coordinates according to the inverse of σ. Wait, let&#x27;s verify this. If σ = (1 2 3), then σ(1) = 2, σ(2) = 3, σ(3) = 1. So σ ⋅ e_1 = e_2, σ ⋅ e_2 = e_3, σ ⋅ e_3 = e_1. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which corresponds to the vector (c, a, b). 

But if we think of how permutations act on coordinates, if we have a permutation σ, the corresponding permutation of the coordinates is σ^{-1}. Because if you have a permutation σ, the coordinate representation of σ ⋅ v is (c, a, b) when σ is (1 2 3). Let me check with another example. Take σ = (1 2). Then σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (b, a, c). But σ^{-1} is also (1 2), since transpositions are self-inverse. So in this case, the coordinate permutation is indeed σ^{-1} acting on the coordinates. 

Therefore, in general, the action of σ on the vector v is given by permuting the coordinates according to σ^{-1}. But for our purposes, since we are considering all σ in S_3, and the group is closed under inverses, requiring that the vector is fixed under all σ in S_3 is equivalent to requiring that the vector is fixed under all permutations of its coordinates. 

Therefore, the vectors fixed by the S_3 action are exactly the vectors whose coordinates are invariant under any permutation. Therefore, as previously thought, such vectors must have all coordinates equal. Hence, the fixed vectors are (k, k, k) for k ∈ F_3, which gives three vectors. 

But let me confirm this with an example. Suppose we have a vector (1, 1, 1). Applying any permutation σ, we get (1, 1, 1) again. Similarly, (2, 2, 2) and (0, 0, 0). Are there any other vectors? Suppose we take (1, 1, 0). Applying the permutation (1 2 3) to this vector would cycle the coordinates, resulting in (0, 1, 1), which is different from (1, 1, 0). Therefore, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, (1, 2, 1). Applying the transposition (2 3) would give (1, 1, 2), which is different. 

Another test: consider (1, 2, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2), we get (2, 1, 0). Since 1 ≠ 2 in F_3, this vector isn&#x27;t fixed. 

Wait a minute, but in F_3, 2 is equal to -1, right? So 2 is distinct from 1. So indeed, unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a non-trivial combination where permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector. For example, if the entries are arranged in such a way that they are symmetric with respect to all permutations. But over F_3, the only way that permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector is if all entries are the same. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so unless all entries are equal, swapping two different entries would result in a different vector. 

Therefore, it&#x27;s confirmed that the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are precisely the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector, hence three vectors in total. 

But just to make sure, let&#x27;s think in terms of linear algebra. The fixed vectors under a group action form a subspace, called the invariant subspace. In this case, the fixed subspace under S_3. To find its dimension, we can use the concept of averaging over the group, but since we are over a finite field, we need to be careful. 

Alternatively, we can note that the action of S_3 is a permutation representation, and the fixed vectors are the trivial subrepresentation, which is one-dimensional if the field is algebraically closed and the characteristic doesn&#x27;t divide the group order. However, here the field is F_3, which has characteristic 3, and 3 divides the order of S_3 (which is 6). Therefore, Maschke&#x27;s theorem doesn&#x27;t apply, and the representation is not semisimple. 

But in our case, we are just looking for the vectors fixed by the entire group. Regardless of the structure of the representation, the fixed vectors can be found by solving the equations σ(v) = v for all σ ∈ S_3. 

But since S_3 is generated by transpositions, we can just consider the transpositions. Let&#x27;s take the transposition (1 2). For a vector (a, b, c) to be fixed by (1 2), we must have (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies a = b. Similarly, applying the transposition (1 3) gives (c, b, a) = (a, b, c), so a = c. Hence, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, even if we just consider the transpositions, we get that a = b = c. Therefore, only the vectors with all coordinates equal are fixed by S_3. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are three such vectors: (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). Hence, the cardinality is 3. 

But wait, hold on. Let me check once again. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then under any permutation, it remains (a, a, a). Therefore, these are fixed. Suppose there exists another vector fixed by all permutations. Then, since S_3 acts by permuting the coordinates, such a vector must have all coordinates equal. Therefore, the fixed subspace is indeed { (a, a, a) | a ∈ F_3 }, which has size 3. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

However, let me consider the possibility that maybe the problem is not about permuting the coordinates, but permuting the basis vectors. Wait, the problem says &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)} for all σ ∈ S_3&quot;. Therefore, the action on a general vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But in terms of coordinates with respect to the original basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}, this permutes the basis vectors, hence permuting the coefficients accordingly. For example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3. In terms of the original basis, this is b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. Therefore, the coordinates of σ ⋅ v are (b, a, c). 

Therefore, as before, to have σ ⋅ v = v for all σ ∈ S_3, the coordinates must satisfy that for any permutation of the coordinates, the vector remains the same. Therefore, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are those with all coordinates equal, so three vectors. 

But wait, maybe in the vector space over F_3, the equations a = b = c have only three solutions: a = 0,1,2. Therefore, the fixed vectors are indeed (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). 

Therefore, the cardinality is 3. 

So, after going through this reasoning, I think the answer is 3. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{3}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field \(\Bbb F_3 = \{0, 1, 2\}\) that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group \(S_3\) on the basis \(\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}\), we need to find all vectors \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) such that \(\sigma \cdot v = v\) for every \(\sigma \in S_3\).

The action of a permutation \(\sigma \in S_3\) on a vector \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) permutes the basis vectors, resulting in the vector \(\sigma \cdot v = a e_{\sigma(1)} + b e_{\sigma(2)} + c e_{\sigma(3)}\). For \(v\) to be fixed by all permutations, the coefficients \(a, b, c\) must remain unchanged under any permutation of their indices.

This implies that \(a, b, c\) must be equal. Therefore, the fixed vectors are of the form \((k, k, k)\) where \(k \in \Bbb F_3\). The possible values for \(k\) are 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to the vectors \((0, 0, 0)\), \((1, 1, 1)\), and \((2, 2, 2)\).

Thus, the cardinality of the set of fixed vectors is 3.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field F_3 = {0, 1, 2} that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group S_3 on the basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}. The action is given by permuting the basis vectors according to the permutation σ. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a vector space V = F_3^3, and the symmetric group S_3 acts on the basis vectors by permuting their indices. For example, if σ is the permutation (1 2 3), then σ·e_1 = e_2, σ·e_2 = e_3, and σ·e_3 = e_1. This action extends linearly to the entire vector space. 

The question is asking for the number of vectors in V that are fixed by every element of S_3. That is, we need all vectors v ∈ V such that σ·v = v for every σ in S_3. 

Since S_3 is a group, it&#x27;s generated by its elements. So, instead of checking the condition for every σ in S_3, maybe I can check it for a set of generators of S_3. The symmetric group S_3 is generated by a transposition and a 3-cycle, for example, the transposition (1 2) and the 3-cycle (1 2 3). If a vector is fixed by these two permutations, it will be fixed by the entire group. 

But perhaps it&#x27;s easier to consider all permutations. Let me think.

First, let&#x27;s recall that a vector v in V can be written as v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, where a, b, c ∈ F_3. The action of S_3 on such a vector permutes the coefficients a, b, c according to the permutation of the basis vectors. For example, applying the permutation (1 2) to v gives (1 2)·v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. 

Therefore, for v to be fixed by every permutation, it must satisfy that for every σ ∈ S_3, the coefficients a, b, c are permuted among themselves without changing. That is, the coefficients must be invariant under any permutation of their indices. 

Therefore, the only way this can happen is if all the coefficients a, b, c are equal. For example, if a = b = c, then permuting them won&#x27;t change the vector. Conversely, if permuting the coefficients doesn&#x27;t change the vector, then all coefficients must be equal. 

So, the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are exactly the vectors of the form (k, k, k) where k ∈ F_3. Therefore, there are three such vectors: (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), and (2, 2, 2). 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check this. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then any permutation will just rearrange the entries, but since they are all the same, the vector remains the same. That seems correct. 

But is this the only case? Suppose a vector is not all the same entries. For example, take (1, 1, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2 3), which cycles the coordinates, we get (0, 1, 1). Since (1, 1, 0) ≠ (0, 1, 1) in F_3^3, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, a vector with two entries the same and one different, like (1, 1, 2), if we apply the transposition (1 2), it remains (1, 1, 2), but if we apply the transposition (1 3), it becomes (2, 1, 1), which is different. Therefore, unless all entries are equal, the vector is not fixed by all permutations. 

But wait, in F_3, (1,1,2) when transposed (1 3) becomes (2,1,1). Since in vectors over F_3, the order matters even if the entries are in a field. So unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. Hence, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). So that&#x27;s three vectors. But wait, is that all? Let me check with another example. Suppose the vector is (0,0,0). Obviously, permuting does nothing. If the vector is (1,1,1), same thing. (2,2,2) as well. 

But maybe there&#x27;s another possibility. Suppose we have a vector that is fixed even though the entries are not all equal. For instance, in some cases, maybe scaling by the field elements could allow more fixed vectors. Wait, but over F_3, the scalars are 0, 1, 2. If the entries are not all the same, permuting them would require that the entries are equal. For example, suppose we have a vector (a, b, c). If applying the permutation (1 2) leaves it fixed, then (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies that a = b. Similarly, applying (1 3) implies a = c, and applying (2 3) implies b = c. Therefore, all three must be equal. Hence, indeed, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed by the entire group. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector. Since the field is F_3, there are three such vectors: 0*(1,1,1) = (0,0,0), 1*(1,1,1) = (1,1,1), and 2*(1,1,1) = (2,2,2). So the cardinality is 3. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check again. Suppose we have the vector (1,1,1). Applying any permutation would not change it, correct. But could there be another vector where, say, even though the entries are different, they are arranged in such a way that permuting doesn&#x27;t change the vector? For example, maybe if the entries are arranged symmetrically in some way. But over F_3, the entries are just elements of the field. The only way for a permutation not to change the vector is if all entries are equal. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so if you have two different entries, swapping them would result in a different vector, unless they are equal. 

Therefore, yes, the conclusion is that the fixed vectors are those with all entries equal. Hence, there are three such vectors. Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

But wait, let me think again. Maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing here. Let me rephrase the problem. The symmetric group S_3 acts by permuting the basis vectors. So when they say &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}&quot;, this is a permutation of the basis vectors, which induces a linear transformation on the vector space. So the action on a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is that σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. But wait, is that correct? Or is it that the permutation permutes the coefficients? 

Wait, no. If you have a permutation σ, then σ acts on the basis vectors, so σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, to compute σ ⋅ v, where v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, you have σ ⋅ v = a σ ⋅ e_1 + b σ ⋅ e_2 + c σ ⋅ e_3 = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in terms of coordinates, this would correspond to swapping the first and second coordinates. Similarly, a 3-cycle would cycle the coordinates. 

Therefore, the action on the vector v is equivalent to permuting its coordinates according to σ. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (a_{σ^{-1}(1)}, a_{σ^{-1}(2)}, a_{σ^{-1}(3)})? Wait, hold on. There&#x27;s a difference between left and right actions here. Let me clarify. 

Suppose we have a permutation σ, which is a bijection σ: {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3}. The action on the basis vectors is σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, if we have a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, then σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But when we express this in terms of the original basis, we need to write σ ⋅ v as a linear combination of e_1, e_2, e_3. So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in coordinates, the vector (a, b, c) becomes (b, a, c). Similarly, for a 3-cycle σ = (1 2 3), we have σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which in coordinates is (c, a, b). 

Therefore, the action of σ on the coordinates is given by permuting the coordinates according to the inverse of σ. Wait, let&#x27;s verify this. If σ = (1 2 3), then σ(1) = 2, σ(2) = 3, σ(3) = 1. So σ ⋅ e_1 = e_2, σ ⋅ e_2 = e_3, σ ⋅ e_3 = e_1. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which corresponds to the vector (c, a, b). 

But if we think of how permutations act on coordinates, if we have a permutation σ, the corresponding permutation of the coordinates is σ^{-1}. Because if you have a permutation σ, the coordinate representation of σ ⋅ v is (c, a, b) when σ is (1 2 3). Let me check with another example. Take σ = (1 2). Then σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (b, a, c). But σ^{-1} is also (1 2), since transpositions are self-inverse. So in this case, the coordinate permutation is indeed σ^{-1} acting on the coordinates. 

Therefore, in general, the action of σ on the vector v is given by permuting the coordinates according to σ^{-1}. But for our purposes, since we are considering all σ in S_3, and the group is closed under inverses, requiring that the vector is fixed under all σ in S_3 is equivalent to requiring that the vector is fixed under all permutations of its coordinates. 

Therefore, the vectors fixed by the S_3 action are exactly the vectors whose coordinates are invariant under any permutation. Therefore, as previously thought, such vectors must have all coordinates equal. Hence, the fixed vectors are (k, k, k) for k ∈ F_3, which gives three vectors. 

But let me confirm this with an example. Suppose we have a vector (1, 1, 1). Applying any permutation σ, we get (1, 1, 1) again. Similarly, (2, 2, 2) and (0, 0, 0). Are there any other vectors? Suppose we take (1, 1, 0). Applying the permutation (1 2 3) to this vector would cycle the coordinates, resulting in (0, 1, 1), which is different from (1, 1, 0). Therefore, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, (1, 2, 1). Applying the transposition (2 3) would give (1, 1, 2), which is different. 

Another test: consider (1, 2, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2), we get (2, 1, 0). Since 1 ≠ 2 in F_3, this vector isn&#x27;t fixed. 

Wait a minute, but in F_3, 2 is equal to -1, right? So 2 is distinct from 1. So indeed, unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a non-trivial combination where permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector. For example, if the entries are arranged in such a way that they are symmetric with respect to all permutations. But over F_3, the only way that permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector is if all entries are the same. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so unless all entries are equal, swapping two different entries would result in a different vector. 

Therefore, it&#x27;s confirmed that the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are precisely the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector, hence three vectors in total. 

But just to make sure, let&#x27;s think in terms of linear algebra. The fixed vectors under a group action form a subspace, called the invariant subspace. In this case, the fixed subspace under S_3. To find its dimension, we can use the concept of averaging over the group, but since we are over a finite field, we need to be careful. 

Alternatively, we can note that the action of S_3 is a permutation representation, and the fixed vectors are the trivial subrepresentation, which is one-dimensional if the field is algebraically closed and the characteristic doesn&#x27;t divide the group order. However, here the field is F_3, which has characteristic 3, and 3 divides the order of S_3 (which is 6). Therefore, Maschke&#x27;s theorem doesn&#x27;t apply, and the representation is not semisimple. 

But in our case, we are just looking for the vectors fixed by the entire group. Regardless of the structure of the representation, the fixed vectors can be found by solving the equations σ(v) = v for all σ ∈ S_3. 

But since S_3 is generated by transpositions, we can just consider the transpositions. Let&#x27;s take the transposition (1 2). For a vector (a, b, c) to be fixed by (1 2), we must have (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies a = b. Similarly, applying the transposition (1 3) gives (c, b, a) = (a, b, c), so a = c. Hence, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, even if we just consider the transpositions, we get that a = b = c. Therefore, only the vectors with all coordinates equal are fixed by S_3. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are three such vectors: (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). Hence, the cardinality is 3. 

But wait, hold on. Let me check once again. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then under any permutation, it remains (a, a, a). Therefore, these are fixed. Suppose there exists another vector fixed by all permutations. Then, since S_3 acts by permuting the coordinates, such a vector must have all coordinates equal. Therefore, the fixed subspace is indeed { (a, a, a) | a ∈ F_3 }, which has size 3. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

However, let me consider the possibility that maybe the problem is not about permuting the coordinates, but permuting the basis vectors. Wait, the problem says &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)} for all σ ∈ S_3&quot;. Therefore, the action on a general vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But in terms of coordinates with respect to the original basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}, this permutes the basis vectors, hence permuting the coefficients accordingly. For example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3. In terms of the original basis, this is b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. Therefore, the coordinates of σ ⋅ v are (b, a, c). 

Therefore, as before, to have σ ⋅ v = v for all σ ∈ S_3, the coordinates must satisfy that for any permutation of the coordinates, the vector remains the same. Therefore, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are those with all coordinates equal, so three vectors. 

But wait, maybe in the vector space over F_3, the equations a = b = c have only three solutions: a = 0,1,2. Therefore, the fixed vectors are indeed (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). 

Therefore, the cardinality is 3. 

So, after going through this reasoning, I think the answer is 3. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{3}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field \(\Bbb F_3 = \{0, 1, 2\}\) that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group \(S_3\) on the basis \(\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}\), we need to find all vectors \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) such that \(\sigma \cdot v = v\) for every \(\sigma \in S_3\).

The action of a permutation \(\sigma \in S_3\) on a vector \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) permutes the basis vectors, resulting in the vector \(\sigma \cdot v = a e_{\sigma(1)} + b e_{\sigma(2)} + c e_{\sigma(3)}\). For \(v\) to be fixed by all permutations, the coefficients \(a, b, c\) must remain unchanged under any permutation of their indices.

This implies that \(a, b, c\) must be equal. Therefore, the fixed vectors are of the form \((k, k, k)\) where \(k \in \Bbb F_3\). The possible values for \(k\) are 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to the vectors \((0, 0, 0)\), \((1, 1, 1)\), and \((2, 2, 2)\).

Thus, the cardinality of the set of fixed vectors is 3.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field F_3 = {0, 1, 2} that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group S_3 on the basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}. The action is given by permuting the basis vectors according to the permutation σ. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a vector space V = F_3^3, and the symmetric group S_3 acts on the basis vectors by permuting their indices. For example, if σ is the permutation (1 2 3), then σ·e_1 = e_2, σ·e_2 = e_3, and σ·e_3 = e_1. This action extends linearly to the entire vector space. 

The question is asking for the number of vectors in V that are fixed by every element of S_3. That is, we need all vectors v ∈ V such that σ·v = v for every σ in S_3. 

Since S_3 is a group, it&#x27;s generated by its elements. So, instead of checking the condition for every σ in S_3, maybe I can check it for a set of generators of S_3. The symmetric group S_3 is generated by a transposition and a 3-cycle, for example, the transposition (1 2) and the 3-cycle (1 2 3). If a vector is fixed by these two permutations, it will be fixed by the entire group. 

But perhaps it&#x27;s easier to consider all permutations. Let me think.

First, let&#x27;s recall that a vector v in V can be written as v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, where a, b, c ∈ F_3. The action of S_3 on such a vector permutes the coefficients a, b, c according to the permutation of the basis vectors. For example, applying the permutation (1 2) to v gives (1 2)·v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. 

Therefore, for v to be fixed by every permutation, it must satisfy that for every σ ∈ S_3, the coefficients a, b, c are permuted among themselves without changing. That is, the coefficients must be invariant under any permutation of their indices. 

Therefore, the only way this can happen is if all the coefficients a, b, c are equal. For example, if a = b = c, then permuting them won&#x27;t change the vector. Conversely, if permuting the coefficients doesn&#x27;t change the vector, then all coefficients must be equal. 

So, the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are exactly the vectors of the form (k, k, k) where k ∈ F_3. Therefore, there are three such vectors: (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), and (2, 2, 2). 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check this. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then any permutation will just rearrange the entries, but since they are all the same, the vector remains the same. That seems correct. 

But is this the only case? Suppose a vector is not all the same entries. For example, take (1, 1, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2 3), which cycles the coordinates, we get (0, 1, 1). Since (1, 1, 0) ≠ (0, 1, 1) in F_3^3, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, a vector with two entries the same and one different, like (1, 1, 2), if we apply the transposition (1 2), it remains (1, 1, 2), but if we apply the transposition (1 3), it becomes (2, 1, 1), which is different. Therefore, unless all entries are equal, the vector is not fixed by all permutations. 

But wait, in F_3, (1,1,2) when transposed (1 3) becomes (2,1,1). Since in vectors over F_3, the order matters even if the entries are in a field. So unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. Hence, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). So that&#x27;s three vectors. But wait, is that all? Let me check with another example. Suppose the vector is (0,0,0). Obviously, permuting does nothing. If the vector is (1,1,1), same thing. (2,2,2) as well. 

But maybe there&#x27;s another possibility. Suppose we have a vector that is fixed even though the entries are not all equal. For instance, in some cases, maybe scaling by the field elements could allow more fixed vectors. Wait, but over F_3, the scalars are 0, 1, 2. If the entries are not all the same, permuting them would require that the entries are equal. For example, suppose we have a vector (a, b, c). If applying the permutation (1 2) leaves it fixed, then (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies that a = b. Similarly, applying (1 3) implies a = c, and applying (2 3) implies b = c. Therefore, all three must be equal. Hence, indeed, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed by the entire group. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector. Since the field is F_3, there are three such vectors: 0*(1,1,1) = (0,0,0), 1*(1,1,1) = (1,1,1), and 2*(1,1,1) = (2,2,2). So the cardinality is 3. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check again. Suppose we have the vector (1,1,1). Applying any permutation would not change it, correct. But could there be another vector where, say, even though the entries are different, they are arranged in such a way that permuting doesn&#x27;t change the vector? For example, maybe if the entries are arranged symmetrically in some way. But over F_3, the entries are just elements of the field. The only way for a permutation not to change the vector is if all entries are equal. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so if you have two different entries, swapping them would result in a different vector, unless they are equal. 

Therefore, yes, the conclusion is that the fixed vectors are those with all entries equal. Hence, there are three such vectors. Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

But wait, let me think again. Maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing here. Let me rephrase the problem. The symmetric group S_3 acts by permuting the basis vectors. So when they say &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}&quot;, this is a permutation of the basis vectors, which induces a linear transformation on the vector space. So the action on a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is that σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. But wait, is that correct? Or is it that the permutation permutes the coefficients? 

Wait, no. If you have a permutation σ, then σ acts on the basis vectors, so σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, to compute σ ⋅ v, where v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, you have σ ⋅ v = a σ ⋅ e_1 + b σ ⋅ e_2 + c σ ⋅ e_3 = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in terms of coordinates, this would correspond to swapping the first and second coordinates. Similarly, a 3-cycle would cycle the coordinates. 

Therefore, the action on the vector v is equivalent to permuting its coordinates according to σ. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (a_{σ^{-1}(1)}, a_{σ^{-1}(2)}, a_{σ^{-1}(3)})? Wait, hold on. There&#x27;s a difference between left and right actions here. Let me clarify. 

Suppose we have a permutation σ, which is a bijection σ: {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3}. The action on the basis vectors is σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, if we have a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, then σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But when we express this in terms of the original basis, we need to write σ ⋅ v as a linear combination of e_1, e_2, e_3. So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in coordinates, the vector (a, b, c) becomes (b, a, c). Similarly, for a 3-cycle σ = (1 2 3), we have σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which in coordinates is (c, a, b). 

Therefore, the action of σ on the coordinates is given by permuting the coordinates according to the inverse of σ. Wait, let&#x27;s verify this. If σ = (1 2 3), then σ(1) = 2, σ(2) = 3, σ(3) = 1. So σ ⋅ e_1 = e_2, σ ⋅ e_2 = e_3, σ ⋅ e_3 = e_1. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which corresponds to the vector (c, a, b). 

But if we think of how permutations act on coordinates, if we have a permutation σ, the corresponding permutation of the coordinates is σ^{-1}. Because if you have a permutation σ, the coordinate representation of σ ⋅ v is (c, a, b) when σ is (1 2 3). Let me check with another example. Take σ = (1 2). Then σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (b, a, c). But σ^{-1} is also (1 2), since transpositions are self-inverse. So in this case, the coordinate permutation is indeed σ^{-1} acting on the coordinates. 

Therefore, in general, the action of σ on the vector v is given by permuting the coordinates according to σ^{-1}. But for our purposes, since we are considering all σ in S_3, and the group is closed under inverses, requiring that the vector is fixed under all σ in S_3 is equivalent to requiring that the vector is fixed under all permutations of its coordinates. 

Therefore, the vectors fixed by the S_3 action are exactly the vectors whose coordinates are invariant under any permutation. Therefore, as previously thought, such vectors must have all coordinates equal. Hence, the fixed vectors are (k, k, k) for k ∈ F_3, which gives three vectors. 

But let me confirm this with an example. Suppose we have a vector (1, 1, 1). Applying any permutation σ, we get (1, 1, 1) again. Similarly, (2, 2, 2) and (0, 0, 0). Are there any other vectors? Suppose we take (1, 1, 0). Applying the permutation (1 2 3) to this vector would cycle the coordinates, resulting in (0, 1, 1), which is different from (1, 1, 0). Therefore, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, (1, 2, 1). Applying the transposition (2 3) would give (1, 1, 2), which is different. 

Another test: consider (1, 2, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2), we get (2, 1, 0). Since 1 ≠ 2 in F_3, this vector isn&#x27;t fixed. 

Wait a minute, but in F_3, 2 is equal to -1, right? So 2 is distinct from 1. So indeed, unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a non-trivial combination where permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector. For example, if the entries are arranged in such a way that they are symmetric with respect to all permutations. But over F_3, the only way that permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector is if all entries are the same. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so unless all entries are equal, swapping two different entries would result in a different vector. 

Therefore, it&#x27;s confirmed that the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are precisely the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector, hence three vectors in total. 

But just to make sure, let&#x27;s think in terms of linear algebra. The fixed vectors under a group action form a subspace, called the invariant subspace. In this case, the fixed subspace under S_3. To find its dimension, we can use the concept of averaging over the group, but since we are over a finite field, we need to be careful. 

Alternatively, we can note that the action of S_3 is a permutation representation, and the fixed vectors are the trivial subrepresentation, which is one-dimensional if the field is algebraically closed and the characteristic doesn&#x27;t divide the group order. However, here the field is F_3, which has characteristic 3, and 3 divides the order of S_3 (which is 6). Therefore, Maschke&#x27;s theorem doesn&#x27;t apply, and the representation is not semisimple. 

But in our case, we are just looking for the vectors fixed by the entire group. Regardless of the structure of the representation, the fixed vectors can be found by solving the equations σ(v) = v for all σ ∈ S_3. 

But since S_3 is generated by transpositions, we can just consider the transpositions. Let&#x27;s take the transposition (1 2). For a vector (a, b, c) to be fixed by (1 2), we must have (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies a = b. Similarly, applying the transposition (1 3) gives (c, b, a) = (a, b, c), so a = c. Hence, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, even if we just consider the transpositions, we get that a = b = c. Therefore, only the vectors with all coordinates equal are fixed by S_3. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are three such vectors: (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). Hence, the cardinality is 3. 

But wait, hold on. Let me check once again. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then under any permutation, it remains (a, a, a). Therefore, these are fixed. Suppose there exists another vector fixed by all permutations. Then, since S_3 acts by permuting the coordinates, such a vector must have all coordinates equal. Therefore, the fixed subspace is indeed { (a, a, a) | a ∈ F_3 }, which has size 3. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

However, let me consider the possibility that maybe the problem is not about permuting the coordinates, but permuting the basis vectors. Wait, the problem says &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)} for all σ ∈ S_3&quot;. Therefore, the action on a general vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But in terms of coordinates with respect to the original basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}, this permutes the basis vectors, hence permuting the coefficients accordingly. For example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3. In terms of the original basis, this is b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. Therefore, the coordinates of σ ⋅ v are (b, a, c). 

Therefore, as before, to have σ ⋅ v = v for all σ ∈ S_3, the coordinates must satisfy that for any permutation of the coordinates, the vector remains the same. Therefore, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are those with all coordinates equal, so three vectors. 

But wait, maybe in the vector space over F_3, the equations a = b = c have only three solutions: a = 0,1,2. Therefore, the fixed vectors are indeed (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). 

Therefore, the cardinality is 3. 

So, after going through this reasoning, I think the answer is 3.

To determine the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field \(\Bbb F_3 = \{0, 1, 2\}\) that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group \(S_3\) on the basis \(\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}\), we need to find all vectors \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) such that \(\sigma \cdot v = v\) for every \(\sigma \in S_3\).

The action of a permutation \(\sigma \in S_3\) on a vector \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) permutes the basis vectors, resulting in the vector \(\sigma \cdot v = a e_{\sigma(1)} + b e_{\sigma(2)} + c e_{\sigma(3)}\). For \(v\) to be fixed by all permutations, the coefficients \(a, b, c\) must remain unchanged under any permutation of their indices.

This implies that \(a, b, c\) must be equal. Therefore, the fixed vectors are of the form \((k, k, k)\) where \(k \in \Bbb F_3\). The possible values for \(k\) are 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to the vectors \((0, 0, 0)\), \((1, 1, 1)\), and \((2, 2, 2)\).

Thus, the cardinality of the set of fixed vectors is 3.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field F_3 = {0, 1, 2} that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group S_3 on the basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}. The action is given by permuting the basis vectors according to the permutation σ. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a vector space V = F_3^3, and the symmetric group S_3 acts on the basis vectors by permuting their indices. For example, if σ is the permutation (1 2 3), then σ·e_1 = e_2, σ·e_2 = e_3, and σ·e_3 = e_1. This action extends linearly to the entire vector space. 

The question is asking for the number of vectors in V that are fixed by every element of S_3. That is, we need all vectors v ∈ V such that σ·v = v for every σ in S_3. 

Since S_3 is a group, it&#x27;s generated by its elements. So, instead of checking the condition for every σ in S_3, maybe I can check it for a set of generators of S_3. The symmetric group S_3 is generated by a transposition and a 3-cycle, for example, the transposition (1 2) and the 3-cycle (1 2 3). If a vector is fixed by these two permutations, it will be fixed by the entire group. 

But perhaps it&#x27;s easier to consider all permutations. Let me think.

First, let&#x27;s recall that a vector v in V can be written as v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, where a, b, c ∈ F_3. The action of S_3 on such a vector permutes the coefficients a, b, c according to the permutation of the basis vectors. For example, applying the permutation (1 2) to v gives (1 2)·v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. 

Therefore, for v to be fixed by every permutation, it must satisfy that for every σ ∈ S_3, the coefficients a, b, c are permuted among themselves without changing. That is, the coefficients must be invariant under any permutation of their indices. 

Therefore, the only way this can happen is if all the coefficients a, b, c are equal. For example, if a = b = c, then permuting them won&#x27;t change the vector. Conversely, if permuting the coefficients doesn&#x27;t change the vector, then all coefficients must be equal. 

So, the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are exactly the vectors of the form (k, k, k) where k ∈ F_3. Therefore, there are three such vectors: (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), and (2, 2, 2). 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check this. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then any permutation will just rearrange the entries, but since they are all the same, the vector remains the same. That seems correct. 

But is this the only case? Suppose a vector is not all the same entries. For example, take (1, 1, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2 3), which cycles the coordinates, we get (0, 1, 1). Since (1, 1, 0) ≠ (0, 1, 1) in F_3^3, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, a vector with two entries the same and one different, like (1, 1, 2), if we apply the transposition (1 2), it remains (1, 1, 2), but if we apply the transposition (1 3), it becomes (2, 1, 1), which is different. Therefore, unless all entries are equal, the vector is not fixed by all permutations. 

But wait, in F_3, (1,1,2) when transposed (1 3) becomes (2,1,1). Since in vectors over F_3, the order matters even if the entries are in a field. So unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. Hence, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). So that&#x27;s three vectors. But wait, is that all? Let me check with another example. Suppose the vector is (0,0,0). Obviously, permuting does nothing. If the vector is (1,1,1), same thing. (2,2,2) as well. 

But maybe there&#x27;s another possibility. Suppose we have a vector that is fixed even though the entries are not all equal. For instance, in some cases, maybe scaling by the field elements could allow more fixed vectors. Wait, but over F_3, the scalars are 0, 1, 2. If the entries are not all the same, permuting them would require that the entries are equal. For example, suppose we have a vector (a, b, c). If applying the permutation (1 2) leaves it fixed, then (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies that a = b. Similarly, applying (1 3) implies a = c, and applying (2 3) implies b = c. Therefore, all three must be equal. Hence, indeed, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed by the entire group. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector. Since the field is F_3, there are three such vectors: 0*(1,1,1) = (0,0,0), 1*(1,1,1) = (1,1,1), and 2*(1,1,1) = (2,2,2). So the cardinality is 3. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check again. Suppose we have the vector (1,1,1). Applying any permutation would not change it, correct. But could there be another vector where, say, even though the entries are different, they are arranged in such a way that permuting doesn&#x27;t change the vector? For example, maybe if the entries are arranged symmetrically in some way. But over F_3, the entries are just elements of the field. The only way for a permutation not to change the vector is if all entries are equal. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so if you have two different entries, swapping them would result in a different vector, unless they are equal. 

Therefore, yes, the conclusion is that the fixed vectors are those with all entries equal. Hence, there are three such vectors. Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

But wait, let me think again. Maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing here. Let me rephrase the problem. The symmetric group S_3 acts by permuting the basis vectors. So when they say &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}&quot;, this is a permutation of the basis vectors, which induces a linear transformation on the vector space. So the action on a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is that σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. But wait, is that correct? Or is it that the permutation permutes the coefficients? 

Wait, no. If you have a permutation σ, then σ acts on the basis vectors, so σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, to compute σ ⋅ v, where v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, you have σ ⋅ v = a σ ⋅ e_1 + b σ ⋅ e_2 + c σ ⋅ e_3 = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in terms of coordinates, this would correspond to swapping the first and second coordinates. Similarly, a 3-cycle would cycle the coordinates. 

Therefore, the action on the vector v is equivalent to permuting its coordinates according to σ. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (a_{σ^{-1}(1)}, a_{σ^{-1}(2)}, a_{σ^{-1}(3)})? Wait, hold on. There&#x27;s a difference between left and right actions here. Let me clarify. 

Suppose we have a permutation σ, which is a bijection σ: {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3}. The action on the basis vectors is σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, if we have a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, then σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But when we express this in terms of the original basis, we need to write σ ⋅ v as a linear combination of e_1, e_2, e_3. So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in coordinates, the vector (a, b, c) becomes (b, a, c). Similarly, for a 3-cycle σ = (1 2 3), we have σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which in coordinates is (c, a, b). 

Therefore, the action of σ on the coordinates is given by permuting the coordinates according to the inverse of σ. Wait, let&#x27;s verify this. If σ = (1 2 3), then σ(1) = 2, σ(2) = 3, σ(3) = 1. So σ ⋅ e_1 = e_2, σ ⋅ e_2 = e_3, σ ⋅ e_3 = e_1. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which corresponds to the vector (c, a, b). 

But if we think of how permutations act on coordinates, if we have a permutation σ, the corresponding permutation of the coordinates is σ^{-1}. Because if you have a permutation σ, the coordinate representation of σ ⋅ v is (c, a, b) when σ is (1 2 3). Let me check with another example. Take σ = (1 2). Then σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (b, a, c). But σ^{-1} is also (1 2), since transpositions are self-inverse. So in this case, the coordinate permutation is indeed σ^{-1} acting on the coordinates. 

Therefore, in general, the action of σ on the vector v is given by permuting the coordinates according to σ^{-1}. But for our purposes, since we are considering all σ in S_3, and the group is closed under inverses, requiring that the vector is fixed under all σ in S_3 is equivalent to requiring that the vector is fixed under all permutations of its coordinates. 

Therefore, the vectors fixed by the S_3 action are exactly the vectors whose coordinates are invariant under any permutation. Therefore, as previously thought, such vectors must have all coordinates equal. Hence, the fixed vectors are (k, k, k) for k ∈ F_3, which gives three vectors. 

But let me confirm this with an example. Suppose we have a vector (1, 1, 1). Applying any permutation σ, we get (1, 1, 1) again. Similarly, (2, 2, 2) and (0, 0, 0). Are there any other vectors? Suppose we take (1, 1, 0). Applying the permutation (1 2 3) to this vector would cycle the coordinates, resulting in (0, 1, 1), which is different from (1, 1, 0). Therefore, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, (1, 2, 1). Applying the transposition (2 3) would give (1, 1, 2), which is different. 

Another test: consider (1, 2, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2), we get (2, 1, 0). Since 1 ≠ 2 in F_3, this vector isn&#x27;t fixed. 

Wait a minute, but in F_3, 2 is equal to -1, right? So 2 is distinct from 1. So indeed, unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a non-trivial combination where permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector. For example, if the entries are arranged in such a way that they are symmetric with respect to all permutations. But over F_3, the only way that permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector is if all entries are the same. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so unless all entries are equal, swapping two different entries would result in a different vector. 

Therefore, it&#x27;s confirmed that the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are precisely the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector, hence three vectors in total. 

But just to make sure, let&#x27;s think in terms of linear algebra. The fixed vectors under a group action form a subspace, called the invariant subspace. In this case, the fixed subspace under S_3. To find its dimension, we can use the concept of averaging over the group, but since we are over a finite field, we need to be careful. 

Alternatively, we can note that the action of S_3 is a permutation representation, and the fixed vectors are the trivial subrepresentation, which is one-dimensional if the field is algebraically closed and the characteristic doesn&#x27;t divide the group order. However, here the field is F_3, which has characteristic 3, and 3 divides the order of S_3 (which is 6). Therefore, Maschke&#x27;s theorem doesn&#x27;t apply, and the representation is not semisimple. 

But in our case, we are just looking for the vectors fixed by the entire group. Regardless of the structure of the representation, the fixed vectors can be found by solving the equations σ(v) = v for all σ ∈ S_3. 

But since S_3 is generated by transpositions, we can just consider the transpositions. Let&#x27;s take the transposition (1 2). For a vector (a, b, c) to be fixed by (1 2), we must have (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies a = b. Similarly, applying the transposition (1 3) gives (c, b, a) = (a, b, c), so a = c. Hence, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, even if we just consider the transpositions, we get that a = b = c. Therefore, only the vectors with all coordinates equal are fixed by S_3. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are three such vectors: (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). Hence, the cardinality is 3. 

But wait, hold on. Let me check once again. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then under any permutation, it remains (a, a, a). Therefore, these are fixed. Suppose there exists another vector fixed by all permutations. Then, since S_3 acts by permuting the coordinates, such a vector must have all coordinates equal. Therefore, the fixed subspace is indeed { (a, a, a) | a ∈ F_3 }, which has size 3. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

However, let me consider the possibility that maybe the problem is not about permuting the coordinates, but permuting the basis vectors. Wait, the problem says &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)} for all σ ∈ S_3&quot;. Therefore, the action on a general vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But in terms of coordinates with respect to the original basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}, this permutes the basis vectors, hence permuting the coefficients accordingly. For example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3. In terms of the original basis, this is b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. Therefore, the coordinates of σ ⋅ v are (b, a, c). 

Therefore, as before, to have σ ⋅ v = v for all σ ∈ S_3, the coordinates must satisfy that for any permutation of the coordinates, the vector remains the same. Therefore, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are those with all coordinates equal, so three vectors. 

But wait, maybe in the vector space over F_3, the equations a = b = c have only three solutions: a = 0,1,2. Therefore, the fixed vectors are indeed (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). 

Therefore, the cardinality is 3. 

So, after going through this reasoning, I think the answer is 3. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{3}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field \(\Bbb F_3 = \{0, 1, 2\}\) that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group \(S_3\) on the basis \(\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}\), we need to find all vectors \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) such that \(\sigma \cdot v = v\) for every \(\sigma \in S_3\).

The action of a permutation \(\sigma \in S_3\) on a vector \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) permutes the basis vectors, resulting in the vector \(\sigma \cdot v = a e_{\sigma(1)} + b e_{\sigma(2)} + c e_{\sigma(3)}\). For \(v\) to be fixed by all permutations, the coefficients \(a, b, c\) must remain unchanged under any permutation of their indices.

This implies that \(a, b, c\) must be equal. Therefore, the fixed vectors are of the form \((k, k, k)\) where \(k \in \Bbb F_3\). The possible values for \(k\) are 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to the vectors \((0, 0, 0)\), \((1, 1, 1)\), and \((2, 2, 2)\).

Thus, the cardinality of the set of fixed vectors is 3.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field F_3 = {0, 1, 2} that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group S_3 on the basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}. The action is given by permuting the basis vectors according to the permutation σ. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a vector space V = F_3^3, and the symmetric group S_3 acts on the basis vectors by permuting their indices. For example, if σ is the permutation (1 2 3), then σ·e_1 = e_2, σ·e_2 = e_3, and σ·e_3 = e_1. This action extends linearly to the entire vector space. 

The question is asking for the number of vectors in V that are fixed by every element of S_3. That is, we need all vectors v ∈ V such that σ·v = v for every σ in S_3. 

Since S_3 is a group, it&#x27;s generated by its elements. So, instead of checking the condition for every σ in S_3, maybe I can check it for a set of generators of S_3. The symmetric group S_3 is generated by a transposition and a 3-cycle, for example, the transposition (1 2) and the 3-cycle (1 2 3). If a vector is fixed by these two permutations, it will be fixed by the entire group. 

But perhaps it&#x27;s easier to consider all permutations. Let me think.

First, let&#x27;s recall that a vector v in V can be written as v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, where a, b, c ∈ F_3. The action of S_3 on such a vector permutes the coefficients a, b, c according to the permutation of the basis vectors. For example, applying the permutation (1 2) to v gives (1 2)·v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. 

Therefore, for v to be fixed by every permutation, it must satisfy that for every σ ∈ S_3, the coefficients a, b, c are permuted among themselves without changing. That is, the coefficients must be invariant under any permutation of their indices. 

Therefore, the only way this can happen is if all the coefficients a, b, c are equal. For example, if a = b = c, then permuting them won&#x27;t change the vector. Conversely, if permuting the coefficients doesn&#x27;t change the vector, then all coefficients must be equal. 

So, the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are exactly the vectors of the form (k, k, k) where k ∈ F_3. Therefore, there are three such vectors: (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), and (2, 2, 2). 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check this. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then any permutation will just rearrange the entries, but since they are all the same, the vector remains the same. That seems correct. 

But is this the only case? Suppose a vector is not all the same entries. For example, take (1, 1, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2 3), which cycles the coordinates, we get (0, 1, 1). Since (1, 1, 0) ≠ (0, 1, 1) in F_3^3, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, a vector with two entries the same and one different, like (1, 1, 2), if we apply the transposition (1 2), it remains (1, 1, 2), but if we apply the transposition (1 3), it becomes (2, 1, 1), which is different. Therefore, unless all entries are equal, the vector is not fixed by all permutations. 

But wait, in F_3, (1,1,2) when transposed (1 3) becomes (2,1,1). Since in vectors over F_3, the order matters even if the entries are in a field. So unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. Hence, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). So that&#x27;s three vectors. But wait, is that all? Let me check with another example. Suppose the vector is (0,0,0). Obviously, permuting does nothing. If the vector is (1,1,1), same thing. (2,2,2) as well. 

But maybe there&#x27;s another possibility. Suppose we have a vector that is fixed even though the entries are not all equal. For instance, in some cases, maybe scaling by the field elements could allow more fixed vectors. Wait, but over F_3, the scalars are 0, 1, 2. If the entries are not all the same, permuting them would require that the entries are equal. For example, suppose we have a vector (a, b, c). If applying the permutation (1 2) leaves it fixed, then (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies that a = b. Similarly, applying (1 3) implies a = c, and applying (2 3) implies b = c. Therefore, all three must be equal. Hence, indeed, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed by the entire group. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector. Since the field is F_3, there are three such vectors: 0*(1,1,1) = (0,0,0), 1*(1,1,1) = (1,1,1), and 2*(1,1,1) = (2,2,2). So the cardinality is 3. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check again. Suppose we have the vector (1,1,1). Applying any permutation would not change it, correct. But could there be another vector where, say, even though the entries are different, they are arranged in such a way that permuting doesn&#x27;t change the vector? For example, maybe if the entries are arranged symmetrically in some way. But over F_3, the entries are just elements of the field. The only way for a permutation not to change the vector is if all entries are equal. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so if you have two different entries, swapping them would result in a different vector, unless they are equal. 

Therefore, yes, the conclusion is that the fixed vectors are those with all entries equal. Hence, there are three such vectors. Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

But wait, let me think again. Maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing here. Let me rephrase the problem. The symmetric group S_3 acts by permuting the basis vectors. So when they say &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}&quot;, this is a permutation of the basis vectors, which induces a linear transformation on the vector space. So the action on a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is that σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. But wait, is that correct? Or is it that the permutation permutes the coefficients? 

Wait, no. If you have a permutation σ, then σ acts on the basis vectors, so σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, to compute σ ⋅ v, where v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, you have σ ⋅ v = a σ ⋅ e_1 + b σ ⋅ e_2 + c σ ⋅ e_3 = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in terms of coordinates, this would correspond to swapping the first and second coordinates. Similarly, a 3-cycle would cycle the coordinates. 

Therefore, the action on the vector v is equivalent to permuting its coordinates according to σ. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (a_{σ^{-1}(1)}, a_{σ^{-1}(2)}, a_{σ^{-1}(3)})? Wait, hold on. There&#x27;s a difference between left and right actions here. Let me clarify. 

Suppose we have a permutation σ, which is a bijection σ: {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3}. The action on the basis vectors is σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, if we have a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, then σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But when we express this in terms of the original basis, we need to write σ ⋅ v as a linear combination of e_1, e_2, e_3. So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in coordinates, the vector (a, b, c) becomes (b, a, c). Similarly, for a 3-cycle σ = (1 2 3), we have σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which in coordinates is (c, a, b). 

Therefore, the action of σ on the coordinates is given by permuting the coordinates according to the inverse of σ. Wait, let&#x27;s verify this. If σ = (1 2 3), then σ(1) = 2, σ(2) = 3, σ(3) = 1. So σ ⋅ e_1 = e_2, σ ⋅ e_2 = e_3, σ ⋅ e_3 = e_1. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which corresponds to the vector (c, a, b). 

But if we think of how permutations act on coordinates, if we have a permutation σ, the corresponding permutation of the coordinates is σ^{-1}. Because if you have a permutation σ, the coordinate representation of σ ⋅ v is (c, a, b) when σ is (1 2 3). Let me check with another example. Take σ = (1 2). Then σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (b, a, c). But σ^{-1} is also (1 2), since transpositions are self-inverse. So in this case, the coordinate permutation is indeed σ^{-1} acting on the coordinates. 

Therefore, in general, the action of σ on the vector v is given by permuting the coordinates according to σ^{-1}. But for our purposes, since we are considering all σ in S_3, and the group is closed under inverses, requiring that the vector is fixed under all σ in S_3 is equivalent to requiring that the vector is fixed under all permutations of its coordinates. 

Therefore, the vectors fixed by the S_3 action are exactly the vectors whose coordinates are invariant under any permutation. Therefore, as previously thought, such vectors must have all coordinates equal. Hence, the fixed vectors are (k, k, k) for k ∈ F_3, which gives three vectors. 

But let me confirm this with an example. Suppose we have a vector (1, 1, 1). Applying any permutation σ, we get (1, 1, 1) again. Similarly, (2, 2, 2) and (0, 0, 0). Are there any other vectors? Suppose we take (1, 1, 0). Applying the permutation (1 2 3) to this vector would cycle the coordinates, resulting in (0, 1, 1), which is different from (1, 1, 0). Therefore, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, (1, 2, 1). Applying the transposition (2 3) would give (1, 1, 2), which is different. 

Another test: consider (1, 2, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2), we get (2, 1, 0). Since 1 ≠ 2 in F_3, this vector isn&#x27;t fixed. 

Wait a minute, but in F_3, 2 is equal to -1, right? So 2 is distinct from 1. So indeed, unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a non-trivial combination where permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector. For example, if the entries are arranged in such a way that they are symmetric with respect to all permutations. But over F_3, the only way that permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector is if all entries are the same. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so unless all entries are equal, swapping two different entries would result in a different vector. 

Therefore, it&#x27;s confirmed that the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are precisely the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector, hence three vectors in total. 

But just to make sure, let&#x27;s think in terms of linear algebra. The fixed vectors under a group action form a subspace, called the invariant subspace. In this case, the fixed subspace under S_3. To find its dimension, we can use the concept of averaging over the group, but since we are over a finite field, we need to be careful. 

Alternatively, we can note that the action of S_3 is a permutation representation, and the fixed vectors are the trivial subrepresentation, which is one-dimensional if the field is algebraically closed and the characteristic doesn&#x27;t divide the group order. However, here the field is F_3, which has characteristic 3, and 3 divides the order of S_3 (which is 6). Therefore, Maschke&#x27;s theorem doesn&#x27;t apply, and the representation is not semisimple. 

But in our case, we are just looking for the vectors fixed by the entire group. Regardless of the structure of the representation, the fixed vectors can be found by solving the equations σ(v) = v for all σ ∈ S_3. 

But since S_3 is generated by transpositions, we can just consider the transpositions. Let&#x27;s take the transposition (1 2). For a vector (a, b, c) to be fixed by (1 2), we must have (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies a = b. Similarly, applying the transposition (1 3) gives (c, b, a) = (a, b, c), so a = c. Hence, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, even if we just consider the transpositions, we get that a = b = c. Therefore, only the vectors with all coordinates equal are fixed by S_3. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are three such vectors: (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). Hence, the cardinality is 3. 

But wait, hold on. Let me check once again. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then under any permutation, it remains (a, a, a). Therefore, these are fixed. Suppose there exists another vector fixed by all permutations. Then, since S_3 acts by permuting the coordinates, such a vector must have all coordinates equal. Therefore, the fixed subspace is indeed { (a, a, a) | a ∈ F_3 }, which has size 3. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

However, let me consider the possibility that maybe the problem is not about permuting the coordinates, but permuting the basis vectors. Wait, the problem says &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)} for all σ ∈ S_3&quot;. Therefore, the action on a general vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But in terms of coordinates with respect to the original basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}, this permutes the basis vectors, hence permuting the coefficients accordingly. For example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3. In terms of the original basis, this is b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. Therefore, the coordinates of σ ⋅ v are (b, a, c). 

Therefore, as before, to have σ ⋅ v = v for all σ ∈ S_3, the coordinates must satisfy that for any permutation of the coordinates, the vector remains the same. Therefore, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are those with all coordinates equal, so three vectors. 

But wait, maybe in the vector space over F_3, the equations a = b = c have only three solutions: a = 0,1,2. Therefore, the fixed vectors are indeed (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). 

Therefore, the cardinality is 3. 

So, after going through this reasoning, I think the answer is 3.

To determine the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field \(\Bbb F_3 = \{0, 1, 2\}\) that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group \(S_3\) on the basis \(\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}\), we need to find all vectors \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) such that \(\sigma \cdot v = v\) for every \(\sigma \in S_3\).

The action of a permutation \(\sigma \in S_3\) on a vector \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) permutes the basis vectors, resulting in the vector \(\sigma \cdot v = a e_{\sigma(1)} + b e_{\sigma(2)} + c e_{\sigma(3)}\). For \(v\) to be fixed by all permutations, the coefficients \(a, b, c\) must remain unchanged under any permutation of their indices.

This implies that \(a, b, c\) must be equal. Therefore, the fixed vectors are of the form \((k, k, k)\) where \(k \in \Bbb F_3\). The possible values for \(k\) are 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to the vectors \((0, 0, 0)\), \((1, 1, 1)\), and \((2, 2, 2)\).

Thus, the cardinality of the set of fixed vectors is 3.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field F_3 = {0, 1, 2} that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group S_3 on the basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}. The action is given by permuting the basis vectors according to the permutation σ. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a vector space V = F_3^3, and the symmetric group S_3 acts on the basis vectors by permuting their indices. For example, if σ is the permutation (1 2 3), then σ·e_1 = e_2, σ·e_2 = e_3, and σ·e_3 = e_1. This action extends linearly to the entire vector space. 

The question is asking for the number of vectors in V that are fixed by every element of S_3. That is, we need all vectors v ∈ V such that σ·v = v for every σ in S_3. 

Since S_3 is a group, it&#x27;s generated by its elements. So, instead of checking the condition for every σ in S_3, maybe I can check it for a set of generators of S_3. The symmetric group S_3 is generated by a transposition and a 3-cycle, for example, the transposition (1 2) and the 3-cycle (1 2 3). If a vector is fixed by these two permutations, it will be fixed by the entire group. 

But perhaps it&#x27;s easier to consider all permutations. Let me think.

First, let&#x27;s recall that a vector v in V can be written as v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, where a, b, c ∈ F_3. The action of S_3 on such a vector permutes the coefficients a, b, c according to the permutation of the basis vectors. For example, applying the permutation (1 2) to v gives (1 2)·v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. 

Therefore, for v to be fixed by every permutation, it must satisfy that for every σ ∈ S_3, the coefficients a, b, c are permuted among themselves without changing. That is, the coefficients must be invariant under any permutation of their indices. 

Therefore, the only way this can happen is if all the coefficients a, b, c are equal. For example, if a = b = c, then permuting them won&#x27;t change the vector. Conversely, if permuting the coefficients doesn&#x27;t change the vector, then all coefficients must be equal. 

So, the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are exactly the vectors of the form (k, k, k) where k ∈ F_3. Therefore, there are three such vectors: (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), and (2, 2, 2). 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check this. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then any permutation will just rearrange the entries, but since they are all the same, the vector remains the same. That seems correct. 

But is this the only case? Suppose a vector is not all the same entries. For example, take (1, 1, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2 3), which cycles the coordinates, we get (0, 1, 1). Since (1, 1, 0) ≠ (0, 1, 1) in F_3^3, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, a vector with two entries the same and one different, like (1, 1, 2), if we apply the transposition (1 2), it remains (1, 1, 2), but if we apply the transposition (1 3), it becomes (2, 1, 1), which is different. Therefore, unless all entries are equal, the vector is not fixed by all permutations. 

But wait, in F_3, (1,1,2) when transposed (1 3) becomes (2,1,1). Since in vectors over F_3, the order matters even if the entries are in a field. So unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. Hence, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). So that&#x27;s three vectors. But wait, is that all? Let me check with another example. Suppose the vector is (0,0,0). Obviously, permuting does nothing. If the vector is (1,1,1), same thing. (2,2,2) as well. 

But maybe there&#x27;s another possibility. Suppose we have a vector that is fixed even though the entries are not all equal. For instance, in some cases, maybe scaling by the field elements could allow more fixed vectors. Wait, but over F_3, the scalars are 0, 1, 2. If the entries are not all the same, permuting them would require that the entries are equal. For example, suppose we have a vector (a, b, c). If applying the permutation (1 2) leaves it fixed, then (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies that a = b. Similarly, applying (1 3) implies a = c, and applying (2 3) implies b = c. Therefore, all three must be equal. Hence, indeed, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed by the entire group. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector. Since the field is F_3, there are three such vectors: 0*(1,1,1) = (0,0,0), 1*(1,1,1) = (1,1,1), and 2*(1,1,1) = (2,2,2). So the cardinality is 3. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check again. Suppose we have the vector (1,1,1). Applying any permutation would not change it, correct. But could there be another vector where, say, even though the entries are different, they are arranged in such a way that permuting doesn&#x27;t change the vector? For example, maybe if the entries are arranged symmetrically in some way. But over F_3, the entries are just elements of the field. The only way for a permutation not to change the vector is if all entries are equal. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so if you have two different entries, swapping them would result in a different vector, unless they are equal. 

Therefore, yes, the conclusion is that the fixed vectors are those with all entries equal. Hence, there are three such vectors. Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

But wait, let me think again. Maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing here. Let me rephrase the problem. The symmetric group S_3 acts by permuting the basis vectors. So when they say &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}&quot;, this is a permutation of the basis vectors, which induces a linear transformation on the vector space. So the action on a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is that σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. But wait, is that correct? Or is it that the permutation permutes the coefficients? 

Wait, no. If you have a permutation σ, then σ acts on the basis vectors, so σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, to compute σ ⋅ v, where v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, you have σ ⋅ v = a σ ⋅ e_1 + b σ ⋅ e_2 + c σ ⋅ e_3 = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in terms of coordinates, this would correspond to swapping the first and second coordinates. Similarly, a 3-cycle would cycle the coordinates. 

Therefore, the action on the vector v is equivalent to permuting its coordinates according to σ. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (a_{σ^{-1}(1)}, a_{σ^{-1}(2)}, a_{σ^{-1}(3)})? Wait, hold on. There&#x27;s a difference between left and right actions here. Let me clarify. 

Suppose we have a permutation σ, which is a bijection σ: {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3}. The action on the basis vectors is σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, if we have a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, then σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But when we express this in terms of the original basis, we need to write σ ⋅ v as a linear combination of e_1, e_2, e_3. So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in coordinates, the vector (a, b, c) becomes (b, a, c). Similarly, for a 3-cycle σ = (1 2 3), we have σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which in coordinates is (c, a, b). 

Therefore, the action of σ on the coordinates is given by permuting the coordinates according to the inverse of σ. Wait, let&#x27;s verify this. If σ = (1 2 3), then σ(1) = 2, σ(2) = 3, σ(3) = 1. So σ ⋅ e_1 = e_2, σ ⋅ e_2 = e_3, σ ⋅ e_3 = e_1. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which corresponds to the vector (c, a, b). 

But if we think of how permutations act on coordinates, if we have a permutation σ, the corresponding permutation of the coordinates is σ^{-1}. Because if you have a permutation σ, the coordinate representation of σ ⋅ v is (c, a, b) when σ is (1 2 3). Let me check with another example. Take σ = (1 2). Then σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (b, a, c). But σ^{-1} is also (1 2), since transpositions are self-inverse. So in this case, the coordinate permutation is indeed σ^{-1} acting on the coordinates. 

Therefore, in general, the action of σ on the vector v is given by permuting the coordinates according to σ^{-1}. But for our purposes, since we are considering all σ in S_3, and the group is closed under inverses, requiring that the vector is fixed under all σ in S_3 is equivalent to requiring that the vector is fixed under all permutations of its coordinates. 

Therefore, the vectors fixed by the S_3 action are exactly the vectors whose coordinates are invariant under any permutation. Therefore, as previously thought, such vectors must have all coordinates equal. Hence, the fixed vectors are (k, k, k) for k ∈ F_3, which gives three vectors. 

But let me confirm this with an example. Suppose we have a vector (1, 1, 1). Applying any permutation σ, we get (1, 1, 1) again. Similarly, (2, 2, 2) and (0, 0, 0). Are there any other vectors? Suppose we take (1, 1, 0). Applying the permutation (1 2 3) to this vector would cycle the coordinates, resulting in (0, 1, 1), which is different from (1, 1, 0). Therefore, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, (1, 2, 1). Applying the transposition (2 3) would give (1, 1, 2), which is different. 

Another test: consider (1, 2, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2), we get (2, 1, 0). Since 1 ≠ 2 in F_3, this vector isn&#x27;t fixed. 

Wait a minute, but in F_3, 2 is equal to -1, right? So 2 is distinct from 1. So indeed, unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a non-trivial combination where permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector. For example, if the entries are arranged in such a way that they are symmetric with respect to all permutations. But over F_3, the only way that permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector is if all entries are the same. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so unless all entries are equal, swapping two different entries would result in a different vector. 

Therefore, it&#x27;s confirmed that the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are precisely the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector, hence three vectors in total. 

But just to make sure, let&#x27;s think in terms of linear algebra. The fixed vectors under a group action form a subspace, called the invariant subspace. In this case, the fixed subspace under S_3. To find its dimension, we can use the concept of averaging over the group, but since we are over a finite field, we need to be careful. 

Alternatively, we can note that the action of S_3 is a permutation representation, and the fixed vectors are the trivial subrepresentation, which is one-dimensional if the field is algebraically closed and the characteristic doesn&#x27;t divide the group order. However, here the field is F_3, which has characteristic 3, and 3 divides the order of S_3 (which is 6). Therefore, Maschke&#x27;s theorem doesn&#x27;t apply, and the representation is not semisimple. 

But in our case, we are just looking for the vectors fixed by the entire group. Regardless of the structure of the representation, the fixed vectors can be found by solving the equations σ(v) = v for all σ ∈ S_3. 

But since S_3 is generated by transpositions, we can just consider the transpositions. Let&#x27;s take the transposition (1 2). For a vector (a, b, c) to be fixed by (1 2), we must have (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies a = b. Similarly, applying the transposition (1 3) gives (c, b, a) = (a, b, c), so a = c. Hence, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, even if we just consider the transpositions, we get that a = b = c. Therefore, only the vectors with all coordinates equal are fixed by S_3. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are three such vectors: (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). Hence, the cardinality is 3. 

But wait, hold on. Let me check once again. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then under any permutation, it remains (a, a, a). Therefore, these are fixed. Suppose there exists another vector fixed by all permutations. Then, since S_3 acts by permuting the coordinates, such a vector must have all coordinates equal. Therefore, the fixed subspace is indeed { (a, a, a) | a ∈ F_3 }, which has size 3. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

However, let me consider the possibility that maybe the problem is not about permuting the coordinates, but permuting the basis vectors. Wait, the problem says &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)} for all σ ∈ S_3&quot;. Therefore, the action on a general vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But in terms of coordinates with respect to the original basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}, this permutes the basis vectors, hence permuting the coefficients accordingly. For example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3. In terms of the original basis, this is b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. Therefore, the coordinates of σ ⋅ v are (b, a, c). 

Therefore, as before, to have σ ⋅ v = v for all σ ∈ S_3, the coordinates must satisfy that for any permutation of the coordinates, the vector remains the same. Therefore, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are those with all coordinates equal, so three vectors. 

But wait, maybe in the vector space over F_3, the equations a = b = c have only three solutions: a = 0,1,2. Therefore, the fixed vectors are indeed (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). 

Therefore, the cardinality is 3. 

So, after going through this reasoning, I think the answer is 3. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{3}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field \(\Bbb F_3 = \{0, 1, 2\}\) that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group \(S_3\) on the basis \(\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}\), we need to find all vectors \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) such that \(\sigma \cdot v = v\) for every \(\sigma \in S_3\).

The action of a permutation \(\sigma \in S_3\) on a vector \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) permutes the basis vectors, resulting in the vector \(\sigma \cdot v = a e_{\sigma(1)} + b e_{\sigma(2)} + c e_{\sigma(3)}\). For \(v\) to be fixed by all permutations, the coefficients \(a, b, c\) must remain unchanged under any permutation of their indices.

This implies that \(a, b, c\) must be equal. Therefore, the fixed vectors are of the form \((k, k, k)\) where \(k \in \Bbb F_3\). The possible values for \(k\) are 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to the vectors \((0, 0, 0)\), \((1, 1, 1)\), and \((2, 2, 2)\).

Thus, the cardinality of the set of fixed vectors is 3.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field F_3 = {0, 1, 2} that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group S_3 on the basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}. The action is given by permuting the basis vectors according to the permutation σ. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a vector space V = F_3^3, and the symmetric group S_3 acts on the basis vectors by permuting their indices. For example, if σ is the permutation (1 2 3), then σ·e_1 = e_2, σ·e_2 = e_3, and σ·e_3 = e_1. This action extends linearly to the entire vector space. 

The question is asking for the number of vectors in V that are fixed by every element of S_3. That is, we need all vectors v ∈ V such that σ·v = v for every σ in S_3. 

Since S_3 is a group, it&#x27;s generated by its elements. So, instead of checking the condition for every σ in S_3, maybe I can check it for a set of generators of S_3. The symmetric group S_3 is generated by a transposition and a 3-cycle, for example, the transposition (1 2) and the 3-cycle (1 2 3). If a vector is fixed by these two permutations, it will be fixed by the entire group. 

But perhaps it&#x27;s easier to consider all permutations. Let me think.

First, let&#x27;s recall that a vector v in V can be written as v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, where a, b, c ∈ F_3. The action of S_3 on such a vector permutes the coefficients a, b, c according to the permutation of the basis vectors. For example, applying the permutation (1 2) to v gives (1 2)·v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. 

Therefore, for v to be fixed by every permutation, it must satisfy that for every σ ∈ S_3, the coefficients a, b, c are permuted among themselves without changing. That is, the coefficients must be invariant under any permutation of their indices. 

Therefore, the only way this can happen is if all the coefficients a, b, c are equal. For example, if a = b = c, then permuting them won&#x27;t change the vector. Conversely, if permuting the coefficients doesn&#x27;t change the vector, then all coefficients must be equal. 

So, the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are exactly the vectors of the form (k, k, k) where k ∈ F_3. Therefore, there are three such vectors: (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), and (2, 2, 2). 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check this. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then any permutation will just rearrange the entries, but since they are all the same, the vector remains the same. That seems correct. 

But is this the only case? Suppose a vector is not all the same entries. For example, take (1, 1, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2 3), which cycles the coordinates, we get (0, 1, 1). Since (1, 1, 0) ≠ (0, 1, 1) in F_3^3, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, a vector with two entries the same and one different, like (1, 1, 2), if we apply the transposition (1 2), it remains (1, 1, 2), but if we apply the transposition (1 3), it becomes (2, 1, 1), which is different. Therefore, unless all entries are equal, the vector is not fixed by all permutations. 

But wait, in F_3, (1,1,2) when transposed (1 3) becomes (2,1,1). Since in vectors over F_3, the order matters even if the entries are in a field. So unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. Hence, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). So that&#x27;s three vectors. But wait, is that all? Let me check with another example. Suppose the vector is (0,0,0). Obviously, permuting does nothing. If the vector is (1,1,1), same thing. (2,2,2) as well. 

But maybe there&#x27;s another possibility. Suppose we have a vector that is fixed even though the entries are not all equal. For instance, in some cases, maybe scaling by the field elements could allow more fixed vectors. Wait, but over F_3, the scalars are 0, 1, 2. If the entries are not all the same, permuting them would require that the entries are equal. For example, suppose we have a vector (a, b, c). If applying the permutation (1 2) leaves it fixed, then (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies that a = b. Similarly, applying (1 3) implies a = c, and applying (2 3) implies b = c. Therefore, all three must be equal. Hence, indeed, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed by the entire group. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector. Since the field is F_3, there are three such vectors: 0*(1,1,1) = (0,0,0), 1*(1,1,1) = (1,1,1), and 2*(1,1,1) = (2,2,2). So the cardinality is 3. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check again. Suppose we have the vector (1,1,1). Applying any permutation would not change it, correct. But could there be another vector where, say, even though the entries are different, they are arranged in such a way that permuting doesn&#x27;t change the vector? For example, maybe if the entries are arranged symmetrically in some way. But over F_3, the entries are just elements of the field. The only way for a permutation not to change the vector is if all entries are equal. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so if you have two different entries, swapping them would result in a different vector, unless they are equal. 

Therefore, yes, the conclusion is that the fixed vectors are those with all entries equal. Hence, there are three such vectors. Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

But wait, let me think again. Maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing here. Let me rephrase the problem. The symmetric group S_3 acts by permuting the basis vectors. So when they say &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}&quot;, this is a permutation of the basis vectors, which induces a linear transformation on the vector space. So the action on a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is that σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. But wait, is that correct? Or is it that the permutation permutes the coefficients? 

Wait, no. If you have a permutation σ, then σ acts on the basis vectors, so σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, to compute σ ⋅ v, where v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, you have σ ⋅ v = a σ ⋅ e_1 + b σ ⋅ e_2 + c σ ⋅ e_3 = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in terms of coordinates, this would correspond to swapping the first and second coordinates. Similarly, a 3-cycle would cycle the coordinates. 

Therefore, the action on the vector v is equivalent to permuting its coordinates according to σ. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (a_{σ^{-1}(1)}, a_{σ^{-1}(2)}, a_{σ^{-1}(3)})? Wait, hold on. There&#x27;s a difference between left and right actions here. Let me clarify. 

Suppose we have a permutation σ, which is a bijection σ: {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3}. The action on the basis vectors is σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, if we have a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, then σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But when we express this in terms of the original basis, we need to write σ ⋅ v as a linear combination of e_1, e_2, e_3. So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in coordinates, the vector (a, b, c) becomes (b, a, c). Similarly, for a 3-cycle σ = (1 2 3), we have σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which in coordinates is (c, a, b). 

Therefore, the action of σ on the coordinates is given by permuting the coordinates according to the inverse of σ. Wait, let&#x27;s verify this. If σ = (1 2 3), then σ(1) = 2, σ(2) = 3, σ(3) = 1. So σ ⋅ e_1 = e_2, σ ⋅ e_2 = e_3, σ ⋅ e_3 = e_1. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which corresponds to the vector (c, a, b). 

But if we think of how permutations act on coordinates, if we have a permutation σ, the corresponding permutation of the coordinates is σ^{-1}. Because if you have a permutation σ, the coordinate representation of σ ⋅ v is (c, a, b) when σ is (1 2 3). Let me check with another example. Take σ = (1 2). Then σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (b, a, c). But σ^{-1} is also (1 2), since transpositions are self-inverse. So in this case, the coordinate permutation is indeed σ^{-1} acting on the coordinates. 

Therefore, in general, the action of σ on the vector v is given by permuting the coordinates according to σ^{-1}. But for our purposes, since we are considering all σ in S_3, and the group is closed under inverses, requiring that the vector is fixed under all σ in S_3 is equivalent to requiring that the vector is fixed under all permutations of its coordinates. 

Therefore, the vectors fixed by the S_3 action are exactly the vectors whose coordinates are invariant under any permutation. Therefore, as previously thought, such vectors must have all coordinates equal. Hence, the fixed vectors are (k, k, k) for k ∈ F_3, which gives three vectors. 

But let me confirm this with an example. Suppose we have a vector (1, 1, 1). Applying any permutation σ, we get (1, 1, 1) again. Similarly, (2, 2, 2) and (0, 0, 0). Are there any other vectors? Suppose we take (1, 1, 0). Applying the permutation (1 2 3) to this vector would cycle the coordinates, resulting in (0, 1, 1), which is different from (1, 1, 0). Therefore, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, (1, 2, 1). Applying the transposition (2 3) would give (1, 1, 2), which is different. 

Another test: consider (1, 2, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2), we get (2, 1, 0). Since 1 ≠ 2 in F_3, this vector isn&#x27;t fixed. 

Wait a minute, but in F_3, 2 is equal to -1, right? So 2 is distinct from 1. So indeed, unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a non-trivial combination where permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector. For example, if the entries are arranged in such a way that they are symmetric with respect to all permutations. But over F_3, the only way that permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector is if all entries are the same. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so unless all entries are equal, swapping two different entries would result in a different vector. 

Therefore, it&#x27;s confirmed that the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are precisely the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector, hence three vectors in total. 

But just to make sure, let&#x27;s think in terms of linear algebra. The fixed vectors under a group action form a subspace, called the invariant subspace. In this case, the fixed subspace under S_3. To find its dimension, we can use the concept of averaging over the group, but since we are over a finite field, we need to be careful. 

Alternatively, we can note that the action of S_3 is a permutation representation, and the fixed vectors are the trivial subrepresentation, which is one-dimensional if the field is algebraically closed and the characteristic doesn&#x27;t divide the group order. However, here the field is F_3, which has characteristic 3, and 3 divides the order of S_3 (which is 6). Therefore, Maschke&#x27;s theorem doesn&#x27;t apply, and the representation is not semisimple. 

But in our case, we are just looking for the vectors fixed by the entire group. Regardless of the structure of the representation, the fixed vectors can be found by solving the equations σ(v) = v for all σ ∈ S_3. 

But since S_3 is generated by transpositions, we can just consider the transpositions. Let&#x27;s take the transposition (1 2). For a vector (a, b, c) to be fixed by (1 2), we must have (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies a = b. Similarly, applying the transposition (1 3) gives (c, b, a) = (a, b, c), so a = c. Hence, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, even if we just consider the transpositions, we get that a = b = c. Therefore, only the vectors with all coordinates equal are fixed by S_3. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are three such vectors: (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). Hence, the cardinality is 3. 

But wait, hold on. Let me check once again. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then under any permutation, it remains (a, a, a). Therefore, these are fixed. Suppose there exists another vector fixed by all permutations. Then, since S_3 acts by permuting the coordinates, such a vector must have all coordinates equal. Therefore, the fixed subspace is indeed { (a, a, a) | a ∈ F_3 }, which has size 3. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

However, let me consider the possibility that maybe the problem is not about permuting the coordinates, but permuting the basis vectors. Wait, the problem says &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)} for all σ ∈ S_3&quot;. Therefore, the action on a general vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But in terms of coordinates with respect to the original basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}, this permutes the basis vectors, hence permuting the coefficients accordingly. For example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3. In terms of the original basis, this is b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. Therefore, the coordinates of σ ⋅ v are (b, a, c). 

Therefore, as before, to have σ ⋅ v = v for all σ ∈ S_3, the coordinates must satisfy that for any permutation of the coordinates, the vector remains the same. Therefore, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are those with all coordinates equal, so three vectors. 

But wait, maybe in the vector space over F_3, the equations a = b = c have only three solutions: a = 0,1,2. Therefore, the fixed vectors are indeed (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). 

Therefore, the cardinality is 3. 

So, after going through this reasoning, I think the answer is 3. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{3}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field \(\Bbb F_3 = \{0, 1, 2\}\) that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group \(S_3\) on the basis \(\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}\), we need to find all vectors \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) such that \(\sigma \cdot v = v\) for every \(\sigma \in S_3\).

The action of a permutation \(\sigma \in S_3\) on a vector \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) permutes the basis vectors, resulting in the vector \(\sigma \cdot v = a e_{\sigma(1)} + b e_{\sigma(2)} + c e_{\sigma(3)}\). For \(v\) to be fixed by all permutations, the coefficients \(a, b, c\) must remain unchanged under any permutation of their indices.

This implies that \(a, b, c\) must be equal. Therefore, the fixed vectors are of the form \((k, k, k)\) where \(k \in \Bbb F_3\). The possible values for \(k\) are 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to the vectors \((0, 0, 0)\), \((1, 1, 1)\), and \((2, 2, 2)\).

Thus, the cardinality of the set of fixed vectors is 3.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field F_3 = {0, 1, 2} that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group S_3 on the basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}. The action is given by permuting the basis vectors according to the permutation σ. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a vector space V = F_3^3, and the symmetric group S_3 acts on the basis vectors by permuting their indices. For example, if σ is the permutation (1 2 3), then σ·e_1 = e_2, σ·e_2 = e_3, and σ·e_3 = e_1. This action extends linearly to the entire vector space. 

The question is asking for the number of vectors in V that are fixed by every element of S_3. That is, we need all vectors v ∈ V such that σ·v = v for every σ in S_3. 

Since S_3 is a group, it&#x27;s generated by its elements. So, instead of checking the condition for every σ in S_3, maybe I can check it for a set of generators of S_3. The symmetric group S_3 is generated by a transposition and a 3-cycle, for example, the transposition (1 2) and the 3-cycle (1 2 3). If a vector is fixed by these two permutations, it will be fixed by the entire group. 

But perhaps it&#x27;s easier to consider all permutations. Let me think.

First, let&#x27;s recall that a vector v in V can be written as v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, where a, b, c ∈ F_3. The action of S_3 on such a vector permutes the coefficients a, b, c according to the permutation of the basis vectors. For example, applying the permutation (1 2) to v gives (1 2)·v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. 

Therefore, for v to be fixed by every permutation, it must satisfy that for every σ ∈ S_3, the coefficients a, b, c are permuted among themselves without changing. That is, the coefficients must be invariant under any permutation of their indices. 

Therefore, the only way this can happen is if all the coefficients a, b, c are equal. For example, if a = b = c, then permuting them won&#x27;t change the vector. Conversely, if permuting the coefficients doesn&#x27;t change the vector, then all coefficients must be equal. 

So, the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are exactly the vectors of the form (k, k, k) where k ∈ F_3. Therefore, there are three such vectors: (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), and (2, 2, 2). 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check this. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then any permutation will just rearrange the entries, but since they are all the same, the vector remains the same. That seems correct. 

But is this the only case? Suppose a vector is not all the same entries. For example, take (1, 1, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2 3), which cycles the coordinates, we get (0, 1, 1). Since (1, 1, 0) ≠ (0, 1, 1) in F_3^3, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, a vector with two entries the same and one different, like (1, 1, 2), if we apply the transposition (1 2), it remains (1, 1, 2), but if we apply the transposition (1 3), it becomes (2, 1, 1), which is different. Therefore, unless all entries are equal, the vector is not fixed by all permutations. 

But wait, in F_3, (1,1,2) when transposed (1 3) becomes (2,1,1). Since in vectors over F_3, the order matters even if the entries are in a field. So unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. Hence, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). So that&#x27;s three vectors. But wait, is that all? Let me check with another example. Suppose the vector is (0,0,0). Obviously, permuting does nothing. If the vector is (1,1,1), same thing. (2,2,2) as well. 

But maybe there&#x27;s another possibility. Suppose we have a vector that is fixed even though the entries are not all equal. For instance, in some cases, maybe scaling by the field elements could allow more fixed vectors. Wait, but over F_3, the scalars are 0, 1, 2. If the entries are not all the same, permuting them would require that the entries are equal. For example, suppose we have a vector (a, b, c). If applying the permutation (1 2) leaves it fixed, then (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies that a = b. Similarly, applying (1 3) implies a = c, and applying (2 3) implies b = c. Therefore, all three must be equal. Hence, indeed, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed by the entire group. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector. Since the field is F_3, there are three such vectors: 0*(1,1,1) = (0,0,0), 1*(1,1,1) = (1,1,1), and 2*(1,1,1) = (2,2,2). So the cardinality is 3. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check again. Suppose we have the vector (1,1,1). Applying any permutation would not change it, correct. But could there be another vector where, say, even though the entries are different, they are arranged in such a way that permuting doesn&#x27;t change the vector? For example, maybe if the entries are arranged symmetrically in some way. But over F_3, the entries are just elements of the field. The only way for a permutation not to change the vector is if all entries are equal. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so if you have two different entries, swapping them would result in a different vector, unless they are equal. 

Therefore, yes, the conclusion is that the fixed vectors are those with all entries equal. Hence, there are three such vectors. Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

But wait, let me think again. Maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing here. Let me rephrase the problem. The symmetric group S_3 acts by permuting the basis vectors. So when they say &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}&quot;, this is a permutation of the basis vectors, which induces a linear transformation on the vector space. So the action on a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is that σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. But wait, is that correct? Or is it that the permutation permutes the coefficients? 

Wait, no. If you have a permutation σ, then σ acts on the basis vectors, so σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, to compute σ ⋅ v, where v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, you have σ ⋅ v = a σ ⋅ e_1 + b σ ⋅ e_2 + c σ ⋅ e_3 = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in terms of coordinates, this would correspond to swapping the first and second coordinates. Similarly, a 3-cycle would cycle the coordinates. 

Therefore, the action on the vector v is equivalent to permuting its coordinates according to σ. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (a_{σ^{-1}(1)}, a_{σ^{-1}(2)}, a_{σ^{-1}(3)})? Wait, hold on. There&#x27;s a difference between left and right actions here. Let me clarify. 

Suppose we have a permutation σ, which is a bijection σ: {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3}. The action on the basis vectors is σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, if we have a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, then σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But when we express this in terms of the original basis, we need to write σ ⋅ v as a linear combination of e_1, e_2, e_3. So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in coordinates, the vector (a, b, c) becomes (b, a, c). Similarly, for a 3-cycle σ = (1 2 3), we have σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which in coordinates is (c, a, b). 

Therefore, the action of σ on the coordinates is given by permuting the coordinates according to the inverse of σ. Wait, let&#x27;s verify this. If σ = (1 2 3), then σ(1) = 2, σ(2) = 3, σ(3) = 1. So σ ⋅ e_1 = e_2, σ ⋅ e_2 = e_3, σ ⋅ e_3 = e_1. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which corresponds to the vector (c, a, b). 

But if we think of how permutations act on coordinates, if we have a permutation σ, the corresponding permutation of the coordinates is σ^{-1}. Because if you have a permutation σ, the coordinate representation of σ ⋅ v is (c, a, b) when σ is (1 2 3). Let me check with another example. Take σ = (1 2). Then σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (b, a, c). But σ^{-1} is also (1 2), since transpositions are self-inverse. So in this case, the coordinate permutation is indeed σ^{-1} acting on the coordinates. 

Therefore, in general, the action of σ on the vector v is given by permuting the coordinates according to σ^{-1}. But for our purposes, since we are considering all σ in S_3, and the group is closed under inverses, requiring that the vector is fixed under all σ in S_3 is equivalent to requiring that the vector is fixed under all permutations of its coordinates. 

Therefore, the vectors fixed by the S_3 action are exactly the vectors whose coordinates are invariant under any permutation. Therefore, as previously thought, such vectors must have all coordinates equal. Hence, the fixed vectors are (k, k, k) for k ∈ F_3, which gives three vectors. 

But let me confirm this with an example. Suppose we have a vector (1, 1, 1). Applying any permutation σ, we get (1, 1, 1) again. Similarly, (2, 2, 2) and (0, 0, 0). Are there any other vectors? Suppose we take (1, 1, 0). Applying the permutation (1 2 3) to this vector would cycle the coordinates, resulting in (0, 1, 1), which is different from (1, 1, 0). Therefore, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, (1, 2, 1). Applying the transposition (2 3) would give (1, 1, 2), which is different. 

Another test: consider (1, 2, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2), we get (2, 1, 0). Since 1 ≠ 2 in F_3, this vector isn&#x27;t fixed. 

Wait a minute, but in F_3, 2 is equal to -1, right? So 2 is distinct from 1. So indeed, unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a non-trivial combination where permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector. For example, if the entries are arranged in such a way that they are symmetric with respect to all permutations. But over F_3, the only way that permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector is if all entries are the same. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so unless all entries are equal, swapping two different entries would result in a different vector. 

Therefore, it&#x27;s confirmed that the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are precisely the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector, hence three vectors in total. 

But just to make sure, let&#x27;s think in terms of linear algebra. The fixed vectors under a group action form a subspace, called the invariant subspace. In this case, the fixed subspace under S_3. To find its dimension, we can use the concept of averaging over the group, but since we are over a finite field, we need to be careful. 

Alternatively, we can note that the action of S_3 is a permutation representation, and the fixed vectors are the trivial subrepresentation, which is one-dimensional if the field is algebraically closed and the characteristic doesn&#x27;t divide the group order. However, here the field is F_3, which has characteristic 3, and 3 divides the order of S_3 (which is 6). Therefore, Maschke&#x27;s theorem doesn&#x27;t apply, and the representation is not semisimple. 

But in our case, we are just looking for the vectors fixed by the entire group. Regardless of the structure of the representation, the fixed vectors can be found by solving the equations σ(v) = v for all σ ∈ S_3. 

But since S_3 is generated by transpositions, we can just consider the transpositions. Let&#x27;s take the transposition (1 2). For a vector (a, b, c) to be fixed by (1 2), we must have (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies a = b. Similarly, applying the transposition (1 3) gives (c, b, a) = (a, b, c), so a = c. Hence, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, even if we just consider the transpositions, we get that a = b = c. Therefore, only the vectors with all coordinates equal are fixed by S_3. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are three such vectors: (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). Hence, the cardinality is 3. 

But wait, hold on. Let me check once again. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then under any permutation, it remains (a, a, a). Therefore, these are fixed. Suppose there exists another vector fixed by all permutations. Then, since S_3 acts by permuting the coordinates, such a vector must have all coordinates equal. Therefore, the fixed subspace is indeed { (a, a, a) | a ∈ F_3 }, which has size 3. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

However, let me consider the possibility that maybe the problem is not about permuting the coordinates, but permuting the basis vectors. Wait, the problem says &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)} for all σ ∈ S_3&quot;. Therefore, the action on a general vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But in terms of coordinates with respect to the original basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}, this permutes the basis vectors, hence permuting the coefficients accordingly. For example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3. In terms of the original basis, this is b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. Therefore, the coordinates of σ ⋅ v are (b, a, c). 

Therefore, as before, to have σ ⋅ v = v for all σ ∈ S_3, the coordinates must satisfy that for any permutation of the coordinates, the vector remains the same. Therefore, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are those with all coordinates equal, so three vectors. 

But wait, maybe in the vector space over F_3, the equations a = b = c have only three solutions: a = 0,1,2. Therefore, the fixed vectors are indeed (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). 

Therefore, the cardinality is 3. 

So, after going through this reasoning, I think the answer is 3.

To determine the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field \(\Bbb F_3 = \{0, 1, 2\}\) that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group \(S_3\) on the basis \(\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}\), we need to find all vectors \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) such that \(\sigma \cdot v = v\) for every \(\sigma \in S_3\).

The action of a permutation \(\sigma \in S_3\) on a vector \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) permutes the basis vectors, resulting in the vector \(\sigma \cdot v = a e_{\sigma(1)} + b e_{\sigma(2)} + c e_{\sigma(3)}\). For \(v\) to be fixed by all permutations, the coefficients \(a, b, c\) must remain unchanged under any permutation of their indices.

This implies that \(a, b, c\) must be equal. Therefore, the fixed vectors are of the form \((k, k, k)\) where \(k \in \Bbb F_3\). The possible values for \(k\) are 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to the vectors \((0, 0, 0)\), \((1, 1, 1)\), and \((2, 2, 2)\).

Thus, the cardinality of the set of fixed vectors is 3.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field F_3 = {0, 1, 2} that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group S_3 on the basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}. The action is given by permuting the basis vectors according to the permutation σ. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a vector space V = F_3^3, and the symmetric group S_3 acts on the basis vectors by permuting their indices. For example, if σ is the permutation (1 2 3), then σ·e_1 = e_2, σ·e_2 = e_3, and σ·e_3 = e_1. This action extends linearly to the entire vector space. 

The question is asking for the number of vectors in V that are fixed by every element of S_3. That is, we need all vectors v ∈ V such that σ·v = v for every σ in S_3. 

Since S_3 is a group, it&#x27;s generated by its elements. So, instead of checking the condition for every σ in S_3, maybe I can check it for a set of generators of S_3. The symmetric group S_3 is generated by a transposition and a 3-cycle, for example, the transposition (1 2) and the 3-cycle (1 2 3). If a vector is fixed by these two permutations, it will be fixed by the entire group. 

But perhaps it&#x27;s easier to consider all permutations. Let me think.

First, let&#x27;s recall that a vector v in V can be written as v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, where a, b, c ∈ F_3. The action of S_3 on such a vector permutes the coefficients a, b, c according to the permutation of the basis vectors. For example, applying the permutation (1 2) to v gives (1 2)·v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. 

Therefore, for v to be fixed by every permutation, it must satisfy that for every σ ∈ S_3, the coefficients a, b, c are permuted among themselves without changing. That is, the coefficients must be invariant under any permutation of their indices. 

Therefore, the only way this can happen is if all the coefficients a, b, c are equal. For example, if a = b = c, then permuting them won&#x27;t change the vector. Conversely, if permuting the coefficients doesn&#x27;t change the vector, then all coefficients must be equal. 

So, the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are exactly the vectors of the form (k, k, k) where k ∈ F_3. Therefore, there are three such vectors: (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), and (2, 2, 2). 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check this. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then any permutation will just rearrange the entries, but since they are all the same, the vector remains the same. That seems correct. 

But is this the only case? Suppose a vector is not all the same entries. For example, take (1, 1, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2 3), which cycles the coordinates, we get (0, 1, 1). Since (1, 1, 0) ≠ (0, 1, 1) in F_3^3, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, a vector with two entries the same and one different, like (1, 1, 2), if we apply the transposition (1 2), it remains (1, 1, 2), but if we apply the transposition (1 3), it becomes (2, 1, 1), which is different. Therefore, unless all entries are equal, the vector is not fixed by all permutations. 

But wait, in F_3, (1,1,2) when transposed (1 3) becomes (2,1,1). Since in vectors over F_3, the order matters even if the entries are in a field. So unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. Hence, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). So that&#x27;s three vectors. But wait, is that all? Let me check with another example. Suppose the vector is (0,0,0). Obviously, permuting does nothing. If the vector is (1,1,1), same thing. (2,2,2) as well. 

But maybe there&#x27;s another possibility. Suppose we have a vector that is fixed even though the entries are not all equal. For instance, in some cases, maybe scaling by the field elements could allow more fixed vectors. Wait, but over F_3, the scalars are 0, 1, 2. If the entries are not all the same, permuting them would require that the entries are equal. For example, suppose we have a vector (a, b, c). If applying the permutation (1 2) leaves it fixed, then (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies that a = b. Similarly, applying (1 3) implies a = c, and applying (2 3) implies b = c. Therefore, all three must be equal. Hence, indeed, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed by the entire group. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector. Since the field is F_3, there are three such vectors: 0*(1,1,1) = (0,0,0), 1*(1,1,1) = (1,1,1), and 2*(1,1,1) = (2,2,2). So the cardinality is 3. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check again. Suppose we have the vector (1,1,1). Applying any permutation would not change it, correct. But could there be another vector where, say, even though the entries are different, they are arranged in such a way that permuting doesn&#x27;t change the vector? For example, maybe if the entries are arranged symmetrically in some way. But over F_3, the entries are just elements of the field. The only way for a permutation not to change the vector is if all entries are equal. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so if you have two different entries, swapping them would result in a different vector, unless they are equal. 

Therefore, yes, the conclusion is that the fixed vectors are those with all entries equal. Hence, there are three such vectors. Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

But wait, let me think again. Maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing here. Let me rephrase the problem. The symmetric group S_3 acts by permuting the basis vectors. So when they say &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}&quot;, this is a permutation of the basis vectors, which induces a linear transformation on the vector space. So the action on a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is that σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. But wait, is that correct? Or is it that the permutation permutes the coefficients? 

Wait, no. If you have a permutation σ, then σ acts on the basis vectors, so σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, to compute σ ⋅ v, where v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, you have σ ⋅ v = a σ ⋅ e_1 + b σ ⋅ e_2 + c σ ⋅ e_3 = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in terms of coordinates, this would correspond to swapping the first and second coordinates. Similarly, a 3-cycle would cycle the coordinates. 

Therefore, the action on the vector v is equivalent to permuting its coordinates according to σ. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (a_{σ^{-1}(1)}, a_{σ^{-1}(2)}, a_{σ^{-1}(3)})? Wait, hold on. There&#x27;s a difference between left and right actions here. Let me clarify. 

Suppose we have a permutation σ, which is a bijection σ: {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3}. The action on the basis vectors is σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, if we have a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, then σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But when we express this in terms of the original basis, we need to write σ ⋅ v as a linear combination of e_1, e_2, e_3. So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in coordinates, the vector (a, b, c) becomes (b, a, c). Similarly, for a 3-cycle σ = (1 2 3), we have σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which in coordinates is (c, a, b). 

Therefore, the action of σ on the coordinates is given by permuting the coordinates according to the inverse of σ. Wait, let&#x27;s verify this. If σ = (1 2 3), then σ(1) = 2, σ(2) = 3, σ(3) = 1. So σ ⋅ e_1 = e_2, σ ⋅ e_2 = e_3, σ ⋅ e_3 = e_1. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which corresponds to the vector (c, a, b). 

But if we think of how permutations act on coordinates, if we have a permutation σ, the corresponding permutation of the coordinates is σ^{-1}. Because if you have a permutation σ, the coordinate representation of σ ⋅ v is (c, a, b) when σ is (1 2 3). Let me check with another example. Take σ = (1 2). Then σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (b, a, c). But σ^{-1} is also (1 2), since transpositions are self-inverse. So in this case, the coordinate permutation is indeed σ^{-1} acting on the coordinates. 

Therefore, in general, the action of σ on the vector v is given by permuting the coordinates according to σ^{-1}. But for our purposes, since we are considering all σ in S_3, and the group is closed under inverses, requiring that the vector is fixed under all σ in S_3 is equivalent to requiring that the vector is fixed under all permutations of its coordinates. 

Therefore, the vectors fixed by the S_3 action are exactly the vectors whose coordinates are invariant under any permutation. Therefore, as previously thought, such vectors must have all coordinates equal. Hence, the fixed vectors are (k, k, k) for k ∈ F_3, which gives three vectors. 

But let me confirm this with an example. Suppose we have a vector (1, 1, 1). Applying any permutation σ, we get (1, 1, 1) again. Similarly, (2, 2, 2) and (0, 0, 0). Are there any other vectors? Suppose we take (1, 1, 0). Applying the permutation (1 2 3) to this vector would cycle the coordinates, resulting in (0, 1, 1), which is different from (1, 1, 0). Therefore, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, (1, 2, 1). Applying the transposition (2 3) would give (1, 1, 2), which is different. 

Another test: consider (1, 2, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2), we get (2, 1, 0). Since 1 ≠ 2 in F_3, this vector isn&#x27;t fixed. 

Wait a minute, but in F_3, 2 is equal to -1, right? So 2 is distinct from 1. So indeed, unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a non-trivial combination where permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector. For example, if the entries are arranged in such a way that they are symmetric with respect to all permutations. But over F_3, the only way that permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector is if all entries are the same. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so unless all entries are equal, swapping two different entries would result in a different vector. 

Therefore, it&#x27;s confirmed that the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are precisely the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector, hence three vectors in total. 

But just to make sure, let&#x27;s think in terms of linear algebra. The fixed vectors under a group action form a subspace, called the invariant subspace. In this case, the fixed subspace under S_3. To find its dimension, we can use the concept of averaging over the group, but since we are over a finite field, we need to be careful. 

Alternatively, we can note that the action of S_3 is a permutation representation, and the fixed vectors are the trivial subrepresentation, which is one-dimensional if the field is algebraically closed and the characteristic doesn&#x27;t divide the group order. However, here the field is F_3, which has characteristic 3, and 3 divides the order of S_3 (which is 6). Therefore, Maschke&#x27;s theorem doesn&#x27;t apply, and the representation is not semisimple. 

But in our case, we are just looking for the vectors fixed by the entire group. Regardless of the structure of the representation, the fixed vectors can be found by solving the equations σ(v) = v for all σ ∈ S_3. 

But since S_3 is generated by transpositions, we can just consider the transpositions. Let&#x27;s take the transposition (1 2). For a vector (a, b, c) to be fixed by (1 2), we must have (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies a = b. Similarly, applying the transposition (1 3) gives (c, b, a) = (a, b, c), so a = c. Hence, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, even if we just consider the transpositions, we get that a = b = c. Therefore, only the vectors with all coordinates equal are fixed by S_3. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are three such vectors: (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). Hence, the cardinality is 3. 

But wait, hold on. Let me check once again. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then under any permutation, it remains (a, a, a). Therefore, these are fixed. Suppose there exists another vector fixed by all permutations. Then, since S_3 acts by permuting the coordinates, such a vector must have all coordinates equal. Therefore, the fixed subspace is indeed { (a, a, a) | a ∈ F_3 }, which has size 3. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

However, let me consider the possibility that maybe the problem is not about permuting the coordinates, but permuting the basis vectors. Wait, the problem says &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)} for all σ ∈ S_3&quot;. Therefore, the action on a general vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But in terms of coordinates with respect to the original basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}, this permutes the basis vectors, hence permuting the coefficients accordingly. For example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3. In terms of the original basis, this is b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. Therefore, the coordinates of σ ⋅ v are (b, a, c). 

Therefore, as before, to have σ ⋅ v = v for all σ ∈ S_3, the coordinates must satisfy that for any permutation of the coordinates, the vector remains the same. Therefore, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are those with all coordinates equal, so three vectors. 

But wait, maybe in the vector space over F_3, the equations a = b = c have only three solutions: a = 0,1,2. Therefore, the fixed vectors are indeed (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). 

Therefore, the cardinality is 3. 

So, after going through this reasoning, I think the answer is 3. 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{3}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field \(\Bbb F_3 = \{0, 1, 2\}\) that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group \(S_3\) on the basis \(\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}\), we need to find all vectors \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) such that \(\sigma \cdot v = v\) for every \(\sigma \in S_3\).

The action of a permutation \(\sigma \in S_3\) on a vector \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) permutes the basis vectors, resulting in the vector \(\sigma \cdot v = a e_{\sigma(1)} + b e_{\sigma(2)} + c e_{\sigma(3)}\). For \(v\) to be fixed by all permutations, the coefficients \(a, b, c\) must remain unchanged under any permutation of their indices.

This implies that \(a, b, c\) must be equal. Therefore, the fixed vectors are of the form \((k, k, k)\) where \(k \in \Bbb F_3\). The possible values for \(k\) are 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to the vectors \((0, 0, 0)\), \((1, 1, 1)\), and \((2, 2, 2)\).

Thus, the cardinality of the set of fixed vectors is 3.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field F_3 = {0, 1, 2} that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group S_3 on the basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}. The action is given by permuting the basis vectors according to the permutation σ. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a vector space V = F_3^3, and the symmetric group S_3 acts on the basis vectors by permuting their indices. For example, if σ is the permutation (1 2 3), then σ·e_1 = e_2, σ·e_2 = e_3, and σ·e_3 = e_1. This action extends linearly to the entire vector space. 

The question is asking for the number of vectors in V that are fixed by every element of S_3. That is, we need all vectors v ∈ V such that σ·v = v for every σ in S_3. 

Since S_3 is a group, it&#x27;s generated by its elements. So, instead of checking the condition for every σ in S_3, maybe I can check it for a set of generators of S_3. The symmetric group S_3 is generated by a transposition and a 3-cycle, for example, the transposition (1 2) and the 3-cycle (1 2 3). If a vector is fixed by these two permutations, it will be fixed by the entire group. 

But perhaps it&#x27;s easier to consider all permutations. Let me think.

First, let&#x27;s recall that a vector v in V can be written as v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, where a, b, c ∈ F_3. The action of S_3 on such a vector permutes the coefficients a, b, c according to the permutation of the basis vectors. For example, applying the permutation (1 2) to v gives (1 2)·v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. 

Therefore, for v to be fixed by every permutation, it must satisfy that for every σ ∈ S_3, the coefficients a, b, c are permuted among themselves without changing. That is, the coefficients must be invariant under any permutation of their indices. 

Therefore, the only way this can happen is if all the coefficients a, b, c are equal. For example, if a = b = c, then permuting them won&#x27;t change the vector. Conversely, if permuting the coefficients doesn&#x27;t change the vector, then all coefficients must be equal. 

So, the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are exactly the vectors of the form (k, k, k) where k ∈ F_3. Therefore, there are three such vectors: (0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), and (2, 2, 2). 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check this. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then any permutation will just rearrange the entries, but since they are all the same, the vector remains the same. That seems correct. 

But is this the only case? Suppose a vector is not all the same entries. For example, take (1, 1, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2 3), which cycles the coordinates, we get (0, 1, 1). Since (1, 1, 0) ≠ (0, 1, 1) in F_3^3, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, a vector with two entries the same and one different, like (1, 1, 2), if we apply the transposition (1 2), it remains (1, 1, 2), but if we apply the transposition (1 3), it becomes (2, 1, 1), which is different. Therefore, unless all entries are equal, the vector is not fixed by all permutations. 

But wait, in F_3, (1,1,2) when transposed (1 3) becomes (2,1,1). Since in vectors over F_3, the order matters even if the entries are in a field. So unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. Hence, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). So that&#x27;s three vectors. But wait, is that all? Let me check with another example. Suppose the vector is (0,0,0). Obviously, permuting does nothing. If the vector is (1,1,1), same thing. (2,2,2) as well. 

But maybe there&#x27;s another possibility. Suppose we have a vector that is fixed even though the entries are not all equal. For instance, in some cases, maybe scaling by the field elements could allow more fixed vectors. Wait, but over F_3, the scalars are 0, 1, 2. If the entries are not all the same, permuting them would require that the entries are equal. For example, suppose we have a vector (a, b, c). If applying the permutation (1 2) leaves it fixed, then (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies that a = b. Similarly, applying (1 3) implies a = c, and applying (2 3) implies b = c. Therefore, all three must be equal. Hence, indeed, only the vectors with all entries equal are fixed by the entire group. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector. Since the field is F_3, there are three such vectors: 0*(1,1,1) = (0,0,0), 1*(1,1,1) = (1,1,1), and 2*(1,1,1) = (2,2,2). So the cardinality is 3. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check again. Suppose we have the vector (1,1,1). Applying any permutation would not change it, correct. But could there be another vector where, say, even though the entries are different, they are arranged in such a way that permuting doesn&#x27;t change the vector? For example, maybe if the entries are arranged symmetrically in some way. But over F_3, the entries are just elements of the field. The only way for a permutation not to change the vector is if all entries are equal. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so if you have two different entries, swapping them would result in a different vector, unless they are equal. 

Therefore, yes, the conclusion is that the fixed vectors are those with all entries equal. Hence, there are three such vectors. Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

But wait, let me think again. Maybe there&#x27;s something I&#x27;m missing here. Let me rephrase the problem. The symmetric group S_3 acts by permuting the basis vectors. So when they say &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}&quot;, this is a permutation of the basis vectors, which induces a linear transformation on the vector space. So the action on a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is that σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. But wait, is that correct? Or is it that the permutation permutes the coefficients? 

Wait, no. If you have a permutation σ, then σ acts on the basis vectors, so σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, to compute σ ⋅ v, where v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, you have σ ⋅ v = a σ ⋅ e_1 + b σ ⋅ e_2 + c σ ⋅ e_3 = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in terms of coordinates, this would correspond to swapping the first and second coordinates. Similarly, a 3-cycle would cycle the coordinates. 

Therefore, the action on the vector v is equivalent to permuting its coordinates according to σ. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (a_{σ^{-1}(1)}, a_{σ^{-1}(2)}, a_{σ^{-1}(3)})? Wait, hold on. There&#x27;s a difference between left and right actions here. Let me clarify. 

Suppose we have a permutation σ, which is a bijection σ: {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3}. The action on the basis vectors is σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)}. Therefore, if we have a vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3, then σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But when we express this in terms of the original basis, we need to write σ ⋅ v as a linear combination of e_1, e_2, e_3. So, for example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3 = b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. So in coordinates, the vector (a, b, c) becomes (b, a, c). Similarly, for a 3-cycle σ = (1 2 3), we have σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which in coordinates is (c, a, b). 

Therefore, the action of σ on the coordinates is given by permuting the coordinates according to the inverse of σ. Wait, let&#x27;s verify this. If σ = (1 2 3), then σ(1) = 2, σ(2) = 3, σ(3) = 1. So σ ⋅ e_1 = e_2, σ ⋅ e_2 = e_3, σ ⋅ e_3 = e_1. Therefore, σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = a e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1, which corresponds to the vector (c, a, b). 

But if we think of how permutations act on coordinates, if we have a permutation σ, the corresponding permutation of the coordinates is σ^{-1}. Because if you have a permutation σ, the coordinate representation of σ ⋅ v is (c, a, b) when σ is (1 2 3). Let me check with another example. Take σ = (1 2). Then σ ⋅ (a, b, c) = (b, a, c). But σ^{-1} is also (1 2), since transpositions are self-inverse. So in this case, the coordinate permutation is indeed σ^{-1} acting on the coordinates. 

Therefore, in general, the action of σ on the vector v is given by permuting the coordinates according to σ^{-1}. But for our purposes, since we are considering all σ in S_3, and the group is closed under inverses, requiring that the vector is fixed under all σ in S_3 is equivalent to requiring that the vector is fixed under all permutations of its coordinates. 

Therefore, the vectors fixed by the S_3 action are exactly the vectors whose coordinates are invariant under any permutation. Therefore, as previously thought, such vectors must have all coordinates equal. Hence, the fixed vectors are (k, k, k) for k ∈ F_3, which gives three vectors. 

But let me confirm this with an example. Suppose we have a vector (1, 1, 1). Applying any permutation σ, we get (1, 1, 1) again. Similarly, (2, 2, 2) and (0, 0, 0). Are there any other vectors? Suppose we take (1, 1, 0). Applying the permutation (1 2 3) to this vector would cycle the coordinates, resulting in (0, 1, 1), which is different from (1, 1, 0). Therefore, this vector is not fixed. Similarly, (1, 2, 1). Applying the transposition (2 3) would give (1, 1, 2), which is different. 

Another test: consider (1, 2, 0). If we apply the permutation (1 2), we get (2, 1, 0). Since 1 ≠ 2 in F_3, this vector isn&#x27;t fixed. 

Wait a minute, but in F_3, 2 is equal to -1, right? So 2 is distinct from 1. So indeed, unless all entries are equal, permuting them would result in a different vector. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a non-trivial combination where permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector. For example, if the entries are arranged in such a way that they are symmetric with respect to all permutations. But over F_3, the only way that permuting the entries doesn&#x27;t change the vector is if all entries are the same. Because permutations can swap any two entries, so unless all entries are equal, swapping two different entries would result in a different vector. 

Therefore, it&#x27;s confirmed that the fixed vectors under the S_3 action are precisely the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector, hence three vectors in total. 

But just to make sure, let&#x27;s think in terms of linear algebra. The fixed vectors under a group action form a subspace, called the invariant subspace. In this case, the fixed subspace under S_3. To find its dimension, we can use the concept of averaging over the group, but since we are over a finite field, we need to be careful. 

Alternatively, we can note that the action of S_3 is a permutation representation, and the fixed vectors are the trivial subrepresentation, which is one-dimensional if the field is algebraically closed and the characteristic doesn&#x27;t divide the group order. However, here the field is F_3, which has characteristic 3, and 3 divides the order of S_3 (which is 6). Therefore, Maschke&#x27;s theorem doesn&#x27;t apply, and the representation is not semisimple. 

But in our case, we are just looking for the vectors fixed by the entire group. Regardless of the structure of the representation, the fixed vectors can be found by solving the equations σ(v) = v for all σ ∈ S_3. 

But since S_3 is generated by transpositions, we can just consider the transpositions. Let&#x27;s take the transposition (1 2). For a vector (a, b, c) to be fixed by (1 2), we must have (b, a, c) = (a, b, c), which implies a = b. Similarly, applying the transposition (1 3) gives (c, b, a) = (a, b, c), so a = c. Hence, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, even if we just consider the transpositions, we get that a = b = c. Therefore, only the vectors with all coordinates equal are fixed by S_3. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are three such vectors: (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). Hence, the cardinality is 3. 

But wait, hold on. Let me check once again. Suppose we have a vector (a, a, a). Then under any permutation, it remains (a, a, a). Therefore, these are fixed. Suppose there exists another vector fixed by all permutations. Then, since S_3 acts by permuting the coordinates, such a vector must have all coordinates equal. Therefore, the fixed subspace is indeed { (a, a, a) | a ∈ F_3 }, which has size 3. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3. 

However, let me consider the possibility that maybe the problem is not about permuting the coordinates, but permuting the basis vectors. Wait, the problem says &quot;the permutation σ acts as σ ⋅ e_i = e_{σ(i)} for all σ ∈ S_3&quot;. Therefore, the action on a general vector v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3 is σ ⋅ v = a e_{σ(1)} + b e_{σ(2)} + c e_{σ(3)}. 

But in terms of coordinates with respect to the original basis {e_1, e_2, e_3}, this permutes the basis vectors, hence permuting the coefficients accordingly. For example, if σ is the transposition (1 2), then σ ⋅ v = a e_2 + b e_1 + c e_3. In terms of the original basis, this is b e_1 + a e_2 + c e_3. Therefore, the coordinates of σ ⋅ v are (b, a, c). 

Therefore, as before, to have σ ⋅ v = v for all σ ∈ S_3, the coordinates must satisfy that for any permutation of the coordinates, the vector remains the same. Therefore, all coordinates must be equal. 

Therefore, the fixed vectors are those with all coordinates equal, so three vectors. 

But wait, maybe in the vector space over F_3, the equations a = b = c have only three solutions: a = 0,1,2. Therefore, the fixed vectors are indeed (0,0,0), (1,1,1), (2,2,2). 

Therefore, the cardinality is 3. 

So, after going through this reasoning, I think the answer is 3.

To determine the cardinality of the set of vectors in the three-dimensional vector space over the finite field \(\Bbb F_3 = \{0, 1, 2\}\) that remain fixed under the action of the symmetric group \(S_3\) on the basis \(\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}\), we need to find all vectors \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) such that \(\sigma \cdot v = v\) for every \(\sigma \in S_3\).

The action of a permutation \(\sigma \in S_3\) on a vector \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\) permutes the basis vectors, resulting in the vector \(\sigma \cdot v = a e_{\sigma(1)} + b e_{\sigma(2)} + c e_{\sigma(3)}\). For \(v\) to be fixed by all permutations, the coefficients \(a, b, c\) must remain unchanged under any permutation of their indices.

This implies that \(a, b, c\) must be equal. Therefore, the fixed vectors are of the form \((k, k, k)\) where \(k \in \Bbb F_3\). The possible values for \(k\) are 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to the vectors \((0, 0, 0)\), \((1, 1, 1)\), and \((2, 2, 2)\).

Thus, the cardinality of the set of fixed vectors is 3.

Problem: To make lemonade, I use a ratio of $7$ parts water to $1$ part lemon juice. If I want to make a gallon of lemonade, and there are four quarts in a gallon, how many quarts of water do I need?

Response: \boxed{7}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: To make lemonade, I need a total of $7 + 1 = 8$ parts liquid. Because I am making a gallon of lemonade, each part must be $\frac{1}{8}$ of a gallon. Converting to quarts gives that each part is $\frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}$ of a quart. Since I have $7$ parts water, I therefore need $7 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{7}{2}}$ quarts of water.          </p>

Since I have $7$ parts water, I therefore need $7 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{7}{2}}$ quarts of water.          </p>

Reference Answer: Since $rs = A$, where $r$ is the inradius, $s$ is the semiperimeter, and $A$ is the area, we have that the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the triangle is $\frac{\pi r^2}{rs} = \frac{\pi r}{s}$. Now we try to express $s$ as $h$ and $r$. Denote the points where the incircle meets the triangle as $X,Y,Z$, where $O$ is the incenter, and denote $AX = AY = z, BX = BZ = y, CY = CZ = x$. Since $XOZB$ is a square (tangents are perpendicular to radius), $r = BX = BZ = y$. The perimeter can be expressed as $2(x+y+z)$, so the semiperimeter is $x+y+z$. The hypotenuse is $AY+CY = z+x$. Thus we have $s = x+y+z = (z+x)+y = h+r$. The answer is $\boxed{\frac{\pi r}{h+r}}$.          </p>

Reference Answer: Since $rs = A$, where $r$ is the inradius, $s$ is the semiperimeter, and $A$ is the area, we have that the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the triangle is $\frac{\pi r^2}{rs} = \frac{\pi r}{s}$. Now we try to express $s$ as $h$ and $r$. Denote the points where the incircle meets the triangle as $X,Y,Z$, where $O$ is the incenter, and denote $AX = AY = z, BX = BZ = y, CY = CZ = x$. Since $XOZB$ is a square (tangents are perpendicular to radius), $r = BX = BZ = y$. The perimeter can be expressed as $2(x+y+z)$, so the semiperimeter is $x+y+z$. The hypotenuse is $AY+CY = z+x$. Thus we have $s = x+y+z = (z+x)+y = h+r$. The answer is $\boxed{\frac{\pi r}{h+r}}$.          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out whether an R-linear map F from the space of vector fields V on a differentiable manifold X to R, when evaluated at a point x, depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. The question is, if two vector fields f and g agree at a point x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), does it follow that F(f)(x) equals F(g)(x)? 

First, let me recall some definitions. A vector field on a manifold assigns to each point x in X a tangent vector at x. The space V of vector fields can be considered as a module over the ring of smooth functions C^∞(X). But here, the question mentions an R-linear map F: V → R. Wait, but R here is the real numbers. So F is a linear functional on the space of vector fields. But when we talk about F(f)(x), maybe there&#x27;s a confusion here. Wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number, not something that can be evaluated at a point x. That seems contradictory. Maybe there&#x27;s a misinterpretation here.

Wait, perhaps the question is stated slightly differently. Let me check again. &quot;Determine whether for a differentiable manifold X, the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. Specifically, if f, g ∈ V and f(x) = g(x), does it follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)?&quot;

Wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. So F(f)(x) would be like applying F(f) to x, but F(f) is already a real number, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. So maybe the question has a typo or misstatement. Alternatively, perhaps F is a map from V to C^∞(X), the space of smooth functions on X, and being R-linear. Then F(f) would be a function, and evaluating at x would make sense. So maybe the original question was intended that way. Alternatively, perhaps F is a linear functional on V, but then how does evaluation at x come into play?

Alternatively, maybe F is a differential operator or something else. Wait, maybe the problem is about pointwise defined functionals. For example, a linear map F: V → R that is &quot;evaluated&quot; at a point x. But linear maps from V to R are like covectors, but globally defined. Wait, but in differential geometry, a covector field is a section of the cotangent bundle, assigning to each point a linear functional on the tangent space at that point. But here, F is a linear map from vector fields (sections of the tangent bundle) to R. Such objects are typically called covector fields if they are pointwise. But if F is R-linear, that is, linear over real numbers, then it&#x27;s a global functional. 

But then, for example, integration over the manifold of the vector field contracted with some fixed covector field would be an R-linear map, but it depends on the entire vector field, not just its value at a point. On the other hand, if F is a covector at a point x, then it would be evaluation at x followed by applying a covector. But in that case, F would be C^∞(X)-linear if and only if it&#x27;s a covector field. Wait, the problem states that F is R-linear. So for example, a covector field is C^∞(X)-linear, which is a stronger condition. If F is only R-linear, then it doesn&#x27;t necessarily factor through the value at a single point.

So perhaps the question is asking: if F is an R-linear map from vector fields V to real numbers R, does F(f) depend only on f(x) for some fixed x? But in general, no. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y), evaluation at two different points. Then even if f and g agree at x, they might differ at y, so F(f) ≠ F(g). But in this case, F is R-linear. So that would be a counterexample. But the problem says &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Wait, maybe confusion in the wording. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

&quot;Determine whether for a differentiable manifold X, the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. Specifically, if f, g ∈ V and f(x) = g(x), does it follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)?&quot;

Wait, now I see confusion. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. So &quot;F(f)(x)&quot; is trying to evaluate a real number at a point x, which is meaningless. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation here. Alternatively, perhaps F is a map from V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. Then F(f) is a smooth function, and evaluating at x makes sense. Then the question would be: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? In that case, the answer is no unless F is C^∞(X)-linear. But since F is only R-linear, it might not be local. For example, take F(f) = [D(f)](x), where D is a differential operator of order 1. Then D(f)(x) depends on the derivative of f at x, which in turn depends on the vector field&#x27;s values in a neighborhood, not just at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it&#x27;s a covector field and F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But since F is only R-linear, it can capture more information.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about linear functionals on the tangent space at x. But then the tangent space is a vector space, and linear functionals on it are just covectors. But in that case, the question is trivial. But the way it&#x27;s phrased, talking about vector fields and R-linear maps from V to R suggests that F is a global object.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to distributions in the sense of generalized functions, where a distribution is a linear functional on the space of test functions (vector fields here?), but that seems different.

Wait, perhaps there is a standard result here. In differential geometry, any C^∞(X)-linear map from vector fields to smooth functions is equivalent to a section of the cotangent bundle, i.e., a differential 1-form. Such maps are local, meaning that if two vector fields agree on a neighborhood of x, then their images under the map agree at x. However, for merely R-linear maps, this locality is not guaranteed. There is a theorem called the Peetre theorem which states that any linear map between sections of vector bundles which is support-decreasing (i.e., local) is a differential operator. But here, we are dealing with R-linear maps which might not be local. So, for example, an R-linear map could take a vector field, integrate it against some function over the manifold, and return a real number. Such a map would not depend only on the value at a single point x. Therefore, in general, the answer should be no. 

But the problem specifically says &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Wait, if F maps V to R, then F(f) is a real number, not a function, so talking about its value at a point x is nonsensical. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, and F is actually a map from V to C^∞(X), i.e., the space of smooth functions, which is R-linear. Then F(f) is a smooth function, and F(f)(x) is its evaluation at x. In that case, the question is: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? For that, the answer is no unless F is a differential operator of order 0, i.e., a tensor field. If F is a differential operator of order 1, then F(f)(x) can depend on the derivatives of f at x, hence on the vector field&#x27;s behavior near x, not just its value at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it is a tensor field (a covector field), and in that case, F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But if F is only R-linear, then even if f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) might not equal F(g)(x). 

For example, take X = R, V = vector fields on R, which can be identified with C^∞(R). Let F: V → C^∞(R) be the derivative operator, F(f) = f&#x27;. Then F is R-linear. If f and g agree at x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), but have different derivatives at x, then F(f)(x) = f&#x27;(x) ≠ g&#x27;(x) = F(g)(x). Therefore, even though f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) ≠ F(g)(x). Hence, the answer is no.

But wait, in this case, F maps V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. If the original question is about such maps, then the answer is no. However, if F is a covector field, i.e., C^∞(X)-linear, then F(f)(x) depends only on f(x), but since the question specifies R-linear, not C^∞(X)-linear, the answer would be no. 

Alternatively, if F is a map from V to R (real numbers), then as I thought before, F(f) is a real number, so F(f)(x) is ill-defined. So there must be a confusion in the problem statement. However, assuming that the problem meant F: V → C^∞(X) is R-linear, then the answer is no. If the problem indeed states F: V → R, then the question is malformed because F(f) is a real number, not something you can evaluate at x. 

But maybe the problem is in the context of a point x in the manifold, and F is a linear functional on the space of vector fields, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x). In that case, if F is a linear functional that depends only on f(x), then it&#x27;s equivalent to a covector at x. However, there are linear functionals on V that don&#x27;t come from covectors at a single point. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y) for two distinct points x and y. Then F is R-linear, but depends on the values of f at two points. So even if f and g agree at x, if they differ at y, F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, such an F would not satisfy the condition. Therefore, in general, an R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily depend only on the value at a single point. 

However, if the linear map F is also C^∞(X)-linear, then by the tensor characterization lemma (sometimes called the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry), it is equivalent to a covector field, and thus F(f) depends only on f pointwise. But since the problem specifies only R-linearity, the answer is no.

Therefore, the conclusion is that an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily satisfy that F(f) depends only on f(x); it can depend on the behavior of f at other points. Hence, if f and g agree at x, F(f) and F(g) need not be equal. So the answer is no, it does not follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x).

But wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. The problem states &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Maybe there is a misunderstanding here. Perhaps F is supposed to be a function on the manifold that is constructed from the vector field in an R-linear way. But if F is R-linear from V to R, then F(f) is just a real number, not a function on X. So evaluating it at x doesn&#x27;t make sense. Therefore, maybe the problem is misphrased. Alternatively, maybe F is a function that takes a vector field and a point and returns a real number, being linear in the vector field argument for each fixed point. In that case, the question would make sense: is F(-, x): V → R, which is linear, determined solely by the value of the vector field at x. In that interpretation, the answer would still be no, because as before, you can have F(f, x) depend on derivatives of f at x, hence not just f(x). 

Alternatively, if F is required to be a linear map from V to R for each point x, such that F_x(f) depends only on f(x), then each F_x would be a covector at x, and the assignment x ↦ F_x would be a differential 1-form. But the question is whether an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R (for a fixed x?) has this property. 

But given the problem as stated, with possible ambiguities, the most reasonable interpretation is that F is an R-linear map from V to R, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x), in the sense that if f and g agree at x, then F(f) = F(g). But since F maps into R, the real numbers, F(f) is a single real number. So if we fix x, and consider F as a linear functional on V, does F(f) depend only on f(x)? For example, take F(f) = integral over X of some function times f. Then clearly F(f) depends on f over the whole manifold. Alternatively, F(f) could be f(x_0) for a fixed x_0, which only depends on f at x_0. But in general, linear functionals on V can be a combination of evaluations at multiple points or integrals, etc. Therefore, unless F is specifically an evaluation functional at x, it can depend on more than just the value at x. Hence, the answer is no. 

To make it concrete, suppose X is the real line, V is the space of smooth vector fields (which can be identified with smooth functions on R). Let F: V → R be defined by F(f) = f(0) + f(1). This is R-linear. If f and g agree at x = 0, but differ at x = 1, then F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, even though f(0) = g(0), F(f) ≠ F(g). So in this case, F does not depend only on the value at a single point. Hence, the answer is no.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether an \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) at a point \( x \) depends only on the value of the vector field at that point, we need to analyze if \( f(x) = g(x) \) implies \( F(f)(x) = F(g)(x) \).

1. **Definitions and Context**:
   - A vector field on a manifold \( X \) assigns a tangent vector to each point \( x \in X \).
   - The space \( V \) of vector fields is a module over the ring of smooth functions \( C^\infty(X) \).
   - An \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) is a linear functional on the space of vector fields.

2. **Key Considerations**:
   - If \( F \) were \( C^\infty(X) \)-linear, it would correspond to a covector field, and \( F(f)(x) \) would depend only on \( f(x) \). However, \( F \) is only \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear.
   - \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear maps can depend on more than just the value at a single point. For example, they might involve integrals or evaluations at multiple points.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider \( X = \mathbb{R} \) and \( V \) as the space of smooth vector fields (identified with smooth functions).
   - Define \( F(f) = f(0) + f(1) \). This is \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear.
   - If \( f \) and \( g \) agree at \( x = 0 \) but differ at \( x = 1 \), then \( F(f) \neq F(g) \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - An arbitrary \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) does not necessarily depend only on the value of the vector field at a single point. It can depend on the vector field&#x27;s values at multiple points or other global properties.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{No}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out whether an R-linear map F from the space of vector fields V on a differentiable manifold X to R, when evaluated at a point x, depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. The question is, if two vector fields f and g agree at a point x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), does it follow that F(f)(x) equals F(g)(x)? 

First, let me recall some definitions. A vector field on a manifold assigns to each point x in X a tangent vector at x. The space V of vector fields can be considered as a module over the ring of smooth functions C^∞(X). But here, the question mentions an R-linear map F: V → R. Wait, but R here is the real numbers. So F is a linear functional on the space of vector fields. But when we talk about F(f)(x), maybe there&#x27;s a confusion here. Wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number, not something that can be evaluated at a point x. That seems contradictory. Maybe there&#x27;s a misinterpretation here.

Wait, perhaps the question is stated slightly differently. Let me check again. &quot;Determine whether for a differentiable manifold X, the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. Specifically, if f, g ∈ V and f(x) = g(x), does it follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)?&quot;

Wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. So F(f)(x) would be like applying F(f) to x, but F(f) is already a real number, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. So maybe the question has a typo or misstatement. Alternatively, perhaps F is a map from V to C^∞(X), the space of smooth functions on X, and being R-linear. Then F(f) would be a function, and evaluating at x would make sense. So maybe the original question was intended that way. Alternatively, perhaps F is a linear functional on V, but then how does evaluation at x come into play?

Alternatively, maybe F is a differential operator or something else. Wait, maybe the problem is about pointwise defined functionals. For example, a linear map F: V → R that is &quot;evaluated&quot; at a point x. But linear maps from V to R are like covectors, but globally defined. Wait, but in differential geometry, a covector field is a section of the cotangent bundle, assigning to each point a linear functional on the tangent space at that point. But here, F is a linear map from vector fields (sections of the tangent bundle) to R. Such objects are typically called covector fields if they are pointwise. But if F is R-linear, that is, linear over real numbers, then it&#x27;s a global functional. 

But then, for example, integration over the manifold of the vector field contracted with some fixed covector field would be an R-linear map, but it depends on the entire vector field, not just its value at a point. On the other hand, if F is a covector at a point x, then it would be evaluation at x followed by applying a covector. But in that case, F would be C^∞(X)-linear if and only if it&#x27;s a covector field. Wait, the problem states that F is R-linear. So for example, a covector field is C^∞(X)-linear, which is a stronger condition. If F is only R-linear, then it doesn&#x27;t necessarily factor through the value at a single point.

So perhaps the question is asking: if F is an R-linear map from vector fields V to real numbers R, does F(f) depend only on f(x) for some fixed x? But in general, no. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y), evaluation at two different points. Then even if f and g agree at x, they might differ at y, so F(f) ≠ F(g). But in this case, F is R-linear. So that would be a counterexample. But the problem says &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Wait, maybe confusion in the wording. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

&quot;Determine whether for a differentiable manifold X, the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. Specifically, if f, g ∈ V and f(x) = g(x), does it follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)?&quot;

Wait, now I see confusion. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. So &quot;F(f)(x)&quot; is trying to evaluate a real number at a point x, which is meaningless. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation here. Alternatively, perhaps F is a map from V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. Then F(f) is a smooth function, and evaluating at x makes sense. Then the question would be: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? In that case, the answer is no unless F is C^∞(X)-linear. But since F is only R-linear, it might not be local. For example, take F(f) = [D(f)](x), where D is a differential operator of order 1. Then D(f)(x) depends on the derivative of f at x, which in turn depends on the vector field&#x27;s values in a neighborhood, not just at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it&#x27;s a covector field and F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But since F is only R-linear, it can capture more information.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about linear functionals on the tangent space at x. But then the tangent space is a vector space, and linear functionals on it are just covectors. But in that case, the question is trivial. But the way it&#x27;s phrased, talking about vector fields and R-linear maps from V to R suggests that F is a global object.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to distributions in the sense of generalized functions, where a distribution is a linear functional on the space of test functions (vector fields here?), but that seems different.

Wait, perhaps there is a standard result here. In differential geometry, any C^∞(X)-linear map from vector fields to smooth functions is equivalent to a section of the cotangent bundle, i.e., a differential 1-form. Such maps are local, meaning that if two vector fields agree on a neighborhood of x, then their images under the map agree at x. However, for merely R-linear maps, this locality is not guaranteed. There is a theorem called the Peetre theorem which states that any linear map between sections of vector bundles which is support-decreasing (i.e., local) is a differential operator. But here, we are dealing with R-linear maps which might not be local. So, for example, an R-linear map could take a vector field, integrate it against some function over the manifold, and return a real number. Such a map would not depend only on the value at a single point x. Therefore, in general, the answer should be no. 

But the problem specifically says &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Wait, if F maps V to R, then F(f) is a real number, not a function, so talking about its value at a point x is nonsensical. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, and F is actually a map from V to C^∞(X), i.e., the space of smooth functions, which is R-linear. Then F(f) is a smooth function, and F(f)(x) is its evaluation at x. In that case, the question is: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? For that, the answer is no unless F is a differential operator of order 0, i.e., a tensor field. If F is a differential operator of order 1, then F(f)(x) can depend on the derivatives of f at x, hence on the vector field&#x27;s behavior near x, not just its value at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it is a tensor field (a covector field), and in that case, F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But if F is only R-linear, then even if f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) might not equal F(g)(x). 

For example, take X = R, V = vector fields on R, which can be identified with C^∞(R). Let F: V → C^∞(R) be the derivative operator, F(f) = f&#x27;. Then F is R-linear. If f and g agree at x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), but have different derivatives at x, then F(f)(x) = f&#x27;(x) ≠ g&#x27;(x) = F(g)(x). Therefore, even though f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) ≠ F(g)(x). Hence, the answer is no.

But wait, in this case, F maps V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. If the original question is about such maps, then the answer is no. However, if F is a covector field, i.e., C^∞(X)-linear, then F(f)(x) depends only on f(x), but since the question specifies R-linear, not C^∞(X)-linear, the answer would be no. 

Alternatively, if F is a map from V to R (real numbers), then as I thought before, F(f) is a real number, so F(f)(x) is ill-defined. So there must be a confusion in the problem statement. However, assuming that the problem meant F: V → C^∞(X) is R-linear, then the answer is no. If the problem indeed states F: V → R, then the question is malformed because F(f) is a real number, not something you can evaluate at x. 

But maybe the problem is in the context of a point x in the manifold, and F is a linear functional on the space of vector fields, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x). In that case, if F is a linear functional that depends only on f(x), then it&#x27;s equivalent to a covector at x. However, there are linear functionals on V that don&#x27;t come from covectors at a single point. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y) for two distinct points x and y. Then F is R-linear, but depends on the values of f at two points. So even if f and g agree at x, if they differ at y, F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, such an F would not satisfy the condition. Therefore, in general, an R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily depend only on the value at a single point. 

However, if the linear map F is also C^∞(X)-linear, then by the tensor characterization lemma (sometimes called the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry), it is equivalent to a covector field, and thus F(f) depends only on f pointwise. But since the problem specifies only R-linearity, the answer is no.

Therefore, the conclusion is that an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily satisfy that F(f) depends only on f(x); it can depend on the behavior of f at other points. Hence, if f and g agree at x, F(f) and F(g) need not be equal. So the answer is no, it does not follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x).

But wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. The problem states &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Maybe there is a misunderstanding here. Perhaps F is supposed to be a function on the manifold that is constructed from the vector field in an R-linear way. But if F is R-linear from V to R, then F(f) is just a real number, not a function on X. So evaluating it at x doesn&#x27;t make sense. Therefore, maybe the problem is misphrased. Alternatively, maybe F is a function that takes a vector field and a point and returns a real number, being linear in the vector field argument for each fixed point. In that case, the question would make sense: is F(-, x): V → R, which is linear, determined solely by the value of the vector field at x. In that interpretation, the answer would still be no, because as before, you can have F(f, x) depend on derivatives of f at x, hence not just f(x). 

Alternatively, if F is required to be a linear map from V to R for each point x, such that F_x(f) depends only on f(x), then each F_x would be a covector at x, and the assignment x ↦ F_x would be a differential 1-form. But the question is whether an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R (for a fixed x?) has this property. 

But given the problem as stated, with possible ambiguities, the most reasonable interpretation is that F is an R-linear map from V to R, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x), in the sense that if f and g agree at x, then F(f) = F(g). But since F maps into R, the real numbers, F(f) is a single real number. So if we fix x, and consider F as a linear functional on V, does F(f) depend only on f(x)? For example, take F(f) = integral over X of some function times f. Then clearly F(f) depends on f over the whole manifold. Alternatively, F(f) could be f(x_0) for a fixed x_0, which only depends on f at x_0. But in general, linear functionals on V can be a combination of evaluations at multiple points or integrals, etc. Therefore, unless F is specifically an evaluation functional at x, it can depend on more than just the value at x. Hence, the answer is no. 

To make it concrete, suppose X is the real line, V is the space of smooth vector fields (which can be identified with smooth functions on R). Let F: V → R be defined by F(f) = f(0) + f(1). This is R-linear. If f and g agree at x = 0, but differ at x = 1, then F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, even though f(0) = g(0), F(f) ≠ F(g). So in this case, F does not depend only on the value at a single point. Hence, the answer is no.

Then F(f) is a smooth function, and F(f)(x) is its evaluation at x. In that case, the question is: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? For that, the answer is no unless F is a differential operator of order 0, i.e., a tensor field. If F is a differential operator of order 1, then F(f)(x) can depend on the derivatives of f at x, hence on the vector field&#x27;s behavior near x, not just its value at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it is a tensor field (a covector field), and in that case, F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But if F is only R-linear, then even if f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) might not equal F(g)(x). 

For example, take X = R, V = vector fields on R, which can be identified with C^∞(R). Let F: V → C^∞(R) be the derivative operator, F(f) = f&#x27;. Then F is R-linear. If f and g agree at x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), but have different derivatives at x, then F(f)(x) = f&#x27;(x) ≠ g&#x27;(x) = F(g)(x). Therefore, even though f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) ≠ F(g)(x). Hence, the answer is no.

But wait, in this case, F maps V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. If the original question is about such maps, then the answer is no. However, if F is a covector field, i.e., C^∞(X)-linear, then F(f)(x) depends only on f(x), but since the question specifies R-linear, not C^∞(X)-linear, the answer would be no. 

Alternatively, if F is a map from V to R (real numbers), then as I thought before, F(f) is a real number, so F(f)(x) is ill-defined. So there must be a confusion in the problem statement. However, assuming that the problem meant F: V → C^∞(X) is R-linear, then the answer is no. If the problem indeed states F: V → R, then the question is malformed because F(f) is a real number, not something you can evaluate at x. 

But maybe the problem is in the context of a point x in the manifold, and F is a linear functional on the space of vector fields, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x). In that case, if F is a linear functional that depends only on f(x), then it&#x27;s equivalent to a covector at x. However, there are linear functionals on V that don&#x27;t come from covectors at a single point. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y) for two distinct points x and y. Then F is R-linear, but depends on the values of f at two points. So even if f and g agree at x, if they differ at y, F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, such an F would not satisfy the condition. Therefore, in general, an R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily depend only on the value at a single point. 

However, if the linear map F is also C^∞(X)-linear, then by the tensor characterization lemma (sometimes called the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry), it is equivalent to a covector field, and thus F(f) depends only on f pointwise. But since the problem specifies only R-linearity, the answer is no.

Therefore, the conclusion is that an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily satisfy that F(f) depends only on f(x); it can depend on the behavior of f at other points. Hence, if f and g agree at x, F(f) and F(g) need not be equal. So the answer is no, it does not follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x).

But wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. The problem states &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Maybe there is a misunderstanding here. Perhaps F is supposed to be a function on the manifold that is constructed from the vector field in an R-linear way. But if F is R-linear from V to R, then F(f) is just a real number, not a function on X. So evaluating it at x doesn&#x27;t make sense. Therefore, maybe the problem is misphrased. Alternatively, maybe F is a function that takes a vector field and a point and returns a real number, being linear in the vector field argument for each fixed point. In that case, the question would make sense: is F(-, x): V → R, which is linear, determined solely by the value of the vector field at x. In that interpretation, the answer would still be no, because as before, you can have F(f, x) depend on derivatives of f at x, hence not just f(x). 

Alternatively, if F is required to be a linear map from V to R for each point x, such that F_x(f) depends only on f(x), then each F_x would be a covector at x, and the assignment x ↦ F_x would be a differential 1-form. But the question is whether an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R (for a fixed x?) has this property. 

But given the problem as stated, with possible ambiguities, the most reasonable interpretation is that F is an R-linear map from V to R, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x), in the sense that if f and g agree at x, then F(f) = F(g). But since F maps into R, the real numbers, F(f) is a single real number. So if we fix x, and consider F as a linear functional on V, does F(f) depend only on f(x)? For example, take F(f) = integral over X of some function times f. Then clearly F(f) depends on f over the whole manifold. Alternatively, F(f) could be f(x_0) for a fixed x_0, which only depends on f at x_0. But in general, linear functionals on V can be a combination of evaluations at multiple points or integrals, etc. Therefore, unless F is specifically an evaluation functional at x, it can depend on more than just the value at x. Hence, the answer is no. 

To make it concrete, suppose X is the real line, V is the space of smooth vector fields (which can be identified with smooth functions on R). Let F: V → R be defined by F(f) = f(0) + f(1). This is R-linear. If f and g agree at x = 0, but differ at x = 1, then F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, even though f(0) = g(0), F(f) ≠ F(g). So in this case, F does not depend only on the value at a single point. Hence, the answer is no.

\boxed{No}

To determine whether an \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) at a point \( x \) depends only on the value of the vector field at that point, we need to analyze if \( f(x) = g(x) \) implies \( F(f)(x) = F(g)(x) \).

1. **Definitions and Context**:
   - A vector field on a manifold \( X \) assigns a tangent vector to each point \( x \in X \).
   - The space \( V \) of vector fields is a module over the ring of smooth functions \( C^\infty(X) \).
   - An \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) is a linear functional on the space of vector fields.

2. **Key Considerations**:
   - If \( F \) were \( C^\infty(X) \)-linear, it would correspond to a covector field, and \( F(f)(x) \) would depend only on \( f(x) \). However, \( F \) is only \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear.
   - \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear maps can depend on more than just the value at a single point. For example, they might involve integrals or evaluations at multiple points.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider \( X = \mathbb{R} \) and \( V \) as the space of smooth vector fields (identified with smooth functions).
   - Define \( F(f) = f(0) + f(1) \). This is \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear.
   - If \( f \) and \( g \) agree at \( x = 0 \) but differ at \( x = 1 \), then \( F(f) \neq F(g) \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - An arbitrary \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) does not necessarily depend only on the value of the vector field at a single point. It can depend on the vector field&#x27;s values at multiple points or other global properties.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out whether an R-linear map F from the space of vector fields V on a differentiable manifold X to R, when evaluated at a point x, depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. The question is, if two vector fields f and g agree at a point x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), does it follow that F(f)(x) equals F(g)(x)? 

First, let me recall some definitions. A vector field on a manifold assigns to each point x in X a tangent vector at x. The space V of vector fields can be considered as a module over the ring of smooth functions C^∞(X). But here, the question mentions an R-linear map F: V → R. Wait, but R here is the real numbers. So F is a linear functional on the space of vector fields. But when we talk about F(f)(x), maybe there&#x27;s a confusion here. Wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number, not something that can be evaluated at a point x. That seems contradictory. Maybe there&#x27;s a misinterpretation here.

Wait, perhaps the question is stated slightly differently. Let me check again. &quot;Determine whether for a differentiable manifold X, the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. Specifically, if f, g ∈ V and f(x) = g(x), does it follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)?&quot;

Wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. So F(f)(x) would be like applying F(f) to x, but F(f) is already a real number, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. So maybe the question has a typo or misstatement. Alternatively, perhaps F is a map from V to C^∞(X), the space of smooth functions on X, and being R-linear. Then F(f) would be a function, and evaluating at x would make sense. So maybe the original question was intended that way. Alternatively, perhaps F is a linear functional on V, but then how does evaluation at x come into play?

Alternatively, maybe F is a differential operator or something else. Wait, maybe the problem is about pointwise defined functionals. For example, a linear map F: V → R that is &quot;evaluated&quot; at a point x. But linear maps from V to R are like covectors, but globally defined. Wait, but in differential geometry, a covector field is a section of the cotangent bundle, assigning to each point a linear functional on the tangent space at that point. But here, F is a linear map from vector fields (sections of the tangent bundle) to R. Such objects are typically called covector fields if they are pointwise. But if F is R-linear, that is, linear over real numbers, then it&#x27;s a global functional. 

But then, for example, integration over the manifold of the vector field contracted with some fixed covector field would be an R-linear map, but it depends on the entire vector field, not just its value at a point. On the other hand, if F is a covector at a point x, then it would be evaluation at x followed by applying a covector. But in that case, F would be C^∞(X)-linear if and only if it&#x27;s a covector field. Wait, the problem states that F is R-linear. So for example, a covector field is C^∞(X)-linear, which is a stronger condition. If F is only R-linear, then it doesn&#x27;t necessarily factor through the value at a single point.

So perhaps the question is asking: if F is an R-linear map from vector fields V to real numbers R, does F(f) depend only on f(x) for some fixed x? But in general, no. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y), evaluation at two different points. Then even if f and g agree at x, they might differ at y, so F(f) ≠ F(g). But in this case, F is R-linear. So that would be a counterexample. But the problem says &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Wait, maybe confusion in the wording. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

&quot;Determine whether for a differentiable manifold X, the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. Specifically, if f, g ∈ V and f(x) = g(x), does it follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)?&quot;

Wait, now I see confusion. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. So &quot;F(f)(x)&quot; is trying to evaluate a real number at a point x, which is meaningless. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation here. Alternatively, perhaps F is a map from V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. Then F(f) is a smooth function, and evaluating at x makes sense. Then the question would be: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? In that case, the answer is no unless F is C^∞(X)-linear. But since F is only R-linear, it might not be local. For example, take F(f) = [D(f)](x), where D is a differential operator of order 1. Then D(f)(x) depends on the derivative of f at x, which in turn depends on the vector field&#x27;s values in a neighborhood, not just at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it&#x27;s a covector field and F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But since F is only R-linear, it can capture more information.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about linear functionals on the tangent space at x. But then the tangent space is a vector space, and linear functionals on it are just covectors. But in that case, the question is trivial. But the way it&#x27;s phrased, talking about vector fields and R-linear maps from V to R suggests that F is a global object.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to distributions in the sense of generalized functions, where a distribution is a linear functional on the space of test functions (vector fields here?), but that seems different.

Wait, perhaps there is a standard result here. In differential geometry, any C^∞(X)-linear map from vector fields to smooth functions is equivalent to a section of the cotangent bundle, i.e., a differential 1-form. Such maps are local, meaning that if two vector fields agree on a neighborhood of x, then their images under the map agree at x. However, for merely R-linear maps, this locality is not guaranteed. There is a theorem called the Peetre theorem which states that any linear map between sections of vector bundles which is support-decreasing (i.e., local) is a differential operator. But here, we are dealing with R-linear maps which might not be local. So, for example, an R-linear map could take a vector field, integrate it against some function over the manifold, and return a real number. Such a map would not depend only on the value at a single point x. Therefore, in general, the answer should be no. 

But the problem specifically says &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Wait, if F maps V to R, then F(f) is a real number, not a function, so talking about its value at a point x is nonsensical. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, and F is actually a map from V to C^∞(X), i.e., the space of smooth functions, which is R-linear. Then F(f) is a smooth function, and F(f)(x) is its evaluation at x. In that case, the question is: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? For that, the answer is no unless F is a differential operator of order 0, i.e., a tensor field. If F is a differential operator of order 1, then F(f)(x) can depend on the derivatives of f at x, hence on the vector field&#x27;s behavior near x, not just its value at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it is a tensor field (a covector field), and in that case, F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But if F is only R-linear, then even if f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) might not equal F(g)(x). 

For example, take X = R, V = vector fields on R, which can be identified with C^∞(R). Let F: V → C^∞(R) be the derivative operator, F(f) = f&#x27;. Then F is R-linear. If f and g agree at x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), but have different derivatives at x, then F(f)(x) = f&#x27;(x) ≠ g&#x27;(x) = F(g)(x). Therefore, even though f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) ≠ F(g)(x). Hence, the answer is no.

But wait, in this case, F maps V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. If the original question is about such maps, then the answer is no. However, if F is a covector field, i.e., C^∞(X)-linear, then F(f)(x) depends only on f(x), but since the question specifies R-linear, not C^∞(X)-linear, the answer would be no. 

Alternatively, if F is a map from V to R (real numbers), then as I thought before, F(f) is a real number, so F(f)(x) is ill-defined. So there must be a confusion in the problem statement.

If the problem indeed states F: V → R, then the question is malformed because F(f) is a real number, not something you can evaluate at x.

In that case, if F is a linear functional that depends only on f(x), then it&#x27;s equivalent to a covector at x. However, there are linear functionals on V that don&#x27;t come from covectors at a single point. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y) for two distinct points x and y. Then F is R-linear, but depends on the values of f at two points. So even if f and g agree at x, if they differ at y, F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, such an F would not satisfy the condition. Therefore, in general, an R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily depend only on the value at a single point.

In that interpretation, the answer would still be no, because as before, you can have F(f, x) depend on derivatives of f at x, hence not just f(x). 

Alternatively, if F is required to be a linear map from V to R for each point x, such that F_x(f) depends only on f(x), then each F_x would be a covector at x, and the assignment x ↦ F_x would be a differential 1-form. But the question is whether an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R (for a fixed x?) has this property. 

But given the problem as stated, with possible ambiguities, the most reasonable interpretation is that F is an R-linear map from V to R, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x), in the sense that if f and g agree at x, then F(f) = F(g).

For example, take F(f) = integral over X of some function times f. Then clearly F(f) depends on f over the whole manifold. Alternatively, F(f) could be f(x_0) for a fixed x_0, which only depends on f at x_0. But in general, linear functionals on V can be a combination of evaluations at multiple points or integrals, etc. Therefore, unless F is specifically an evaluation functional at x, it can depend on more than just the value at x. Hence, the answer is no. 

To make it concrete, suppose X is the real line, V is the space of smooth vector fields (which can be identified with smooth functions on R). Let F: V → R be defined by F(f) = f(0) + f(1). This is R-linear. If f and g agree at x = 0, but differ at x = 1, then F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, even though f(0) = g(0), F(f) ≠ F(g). So in this case, F does not depend only on the value at a single point. Hence, the answer is no.

So perhaps the question is asking: if F is an R-linear map from vector fields V to real numbers R, does F(f) depend only on f(x) for some fixed x? But in general, no. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y), evaluation at two different points. Then even if f and g agree at x, they might differ at y, so F(f) ≠ F(g). But in this case, F is R-linear. So that would be a counterexample. But the problem says &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Wait, maybe confusion in the wording. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

&quot;Determine whether for a differentiable manifold X, the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. Specifically, if f, g ∈ V and f(x) = g(x), does it follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)?&quot;

Wait, now I see confusion. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. So &quot;F(f)(x)&quot; is trying to evaluate a real number at a point x, which is meaningless. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation here. Alternatively, perhaps F is a map from V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. Then F(f) is a smooth function, and evaluating at x makes sense. Then the question would be: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? In that case, the answer is no unless F is C^∞(X)-linear. But since F is only R-linear, it might not be local. For example, take F(f) = [D(f)](x), where D is a differential operator of order 1. Then D(f)(x) depends on the derivative of f at x, which in turn depends on the vector field&#x27;s values in a neighborhood, not just at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it&#x27;s a covector field and F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But since F is only R-linear, it can capture more information.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about linear functionals on the tangent space at x. But then the tangent space is a vector space, and linear functionals on it are just covectors. But in that case, the question is trivial. But the way it&#x27;s phrased, talking about vector fields and R-linear maps from V to R suggests that F is a global object.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to distributions in the sense of generalized functions, where a distribution is a linear functional on the space of test functions (vector fields here?), but that seems different.

Wait, perhaps there is a standard result here. In differential geometry, any C^∞(X)-linear map from vector fields to smooth functions is equivalent to a section of the cotangent bundle, i.e., a differential 1-form. Such maps are local, meaning that if two vector fields agree on a neighborhood of x, then their images under the map agree at x. However, for merely R-linear maps, this locality is not guaranteed. There is a theorem called the Peetre theorem which states that any linear map between sections of vector bundles which is support-decreasing (i.e., local) is a differential operator. But here, we are dealing with R-linear maps which might not be local. So, for example, an R-linear map could take a vector field, integrate it against some function over the manifold, and return a real number. Such a map would not depend only on the value at a single point x. Therefore, in general, the answer should be no. 

But the problem specifically says &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Wait, if F maps V to R, then F(f) is a real number, not a function, so talking about its value at a point x is nonsensical. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, and F is actually a map from V to C^∞(X), i.e., the space of smooth functions, which is R-linear. Then F(f) is a smooth function, and F(f)(x) is its evaluation at x. In that case, the question is: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? For that, the answer is no unless F is a differential operator of order 0, i.e., a tensor field. If F is a differential operator of order 1, then F(f)(x) can depend on the derivatives of f at x, hence on the vector field&#x27;s behavior near x, not just its value at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it is a tensor field (a covector field), and in that case, F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But if F is only R-linear, then even if f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) might not equal F(g)(x). 

For example, take X = R, V = vector fields on R, which can be identified with C^∞(R). Let F: V → C^∞(R) be the derivative operator, F(f) = f&#x27;. Then F is R-linear. If f and g agree at x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), but have different derivatives at x, then F(f)(x) = f&#x27;(x) ≠ g&#x27;(x) = F(g)(x). Therefore, even though f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) ≠ F(g)(x). Hence, the answer is no.

But wait, in this case, F maps V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. If the original question is about such maps, then the answer is no. However, if F is a covector field, i.e., C^∞(X)-linear, then F(f)(x) depends only on f(x), but since the question specifies R-linear, not C^∞(X)-linear, the answer would be no. 

Alternatively, if F is a map from V to R (real numbers), then as I thought before, F(f) is a real number, so F(f)(x) is ill-defined. So there must be a confusion in the problem statement. However, assuming that the problem meant F: V → C^∞(X) is R-linear, then the answer is no. If the problem indeed states F: V → R, then the question is malformed because F(f) is a real number, not something you can evaluate at x. 

But maybe the problem is in the context of a point x in the manifold, and F is a linear functional on the space of vector fields, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x). In that case, if F is a linear functional that depends only on f(x), then it&#x27;s equivalent to a covector at x. However, there are linear functionals on V that don&#x27;t come from covectors at a single point. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y) for two distinct points x and y. Then F is R-linear, but depends on the values of f at two points. So even if f and g agree at x, if they differ at y, F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, such an F would not satisfy the condition. Therefore, in general, an R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily depend only on the value at a single point. 

However, if the linear map F is also C^∞(X)-linear, then by the tensor characterization lemma (sometimes called the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry), it is equivalent to a covector field, and thus F(f) depends only on f pointwise. But since the problem specifies only R-linearity, the answer is no.

Therefore, the conclusion is that an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily satisfy that F(f) depends only on f(x); it can depend on the behavior of f at other points. Hence, if f and g agree at x, F(f) and F(g) need not be equal. So the answer is no, it does not follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x).

But wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. The problem states &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Maybe there is a misunderstanding here. Perhaps F is supposed to be a function on the manifold that is constructed from the vector field in an R-linear way. But if F is R-linear from V to R, then F(f) is just a real number, not a function on X. So evaluating it at x doesn&#x27;t make sense. Therefore, maybe the problem is misphrased. Alternatively, maybe F is a function that takes a vector field and a point and returns a real number, being linear in the vector field argument for each fixed point. In that case, the question would make sense: is F(-, x): V → R, which is linear, determined solely by the value of the vector field at x. In that interpretation, the answer would still be no, because as before, you can have F(f, x) depend on derivatives of f at x, hence not just f(x). 

Alternatively, if F is required to be a linear map from V to R for each point x, such that F_x(f) depends only on f(x), then each F_x would be a covector at x, and the assignment x ↦ F_x would be a differential 1-form. But the question is whether an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R (for a fixed x?) has this property. 

But given the problem as stated, with possible ambiguities, the most reasonable interpretation is that F is an R-linear map from V to R, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x), in the sense that if f and g agree at x, then F(f) = F(g). But since F maps into R, the real numbers, F(f) is a single real number. So if we fix x, and consider F as a linear functional on V, does F(f) depend only on f(x)? For example, take F(f) = integral over X of some function times f. Then clearly F(f) depends on f over the whole manifold. Alternatively, F(f) could be f(x_0) for a fixed x_0, which only depends on f at x_0. But in general, linear functionals on V can be a combination of evaluations at multiple points or integrals, etc. Therefore, unless F is specifically an evaluation functional at x, it can depend on more than just the value at x. Hence, the answer is no. 

To make it concrete, suppose X is the real line, V is the space of smooth vector fields (which can be identified with smooth functions on R). Let F: V → R be defined by F(f) = f(0) + f(1). This is R-linear. If f and g agree at x = 0, but differ at x = 1, then F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, even though f(0) = g(0), F(f) ≠ F(g). So in this case, F does not depend only on the value at a single point. Hence, the answer is no.

To determine whether an \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) at a point \( x \) depends only on the value of the vector field at that point, we need to analyze if \( f(x) = g(x) \) implies \( F(f)(x) = F(g)(x) \).

1. **Definitions and Context**:
   - A vector field on a manifold \( X \) assigns a tangent vector to each point \( x \in X \).
   - The space \( V \) of vector fields is a module over the ring of smooth functions \( C^\infty(X) \).
   - An \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) is a linear functional on the space of vector fields.

   - Consider \( X = \mathbb{R} \) and \( V \) as the space of smooth vector fields (identified with smooth functions).
   - Define \( F(f) = f(0) + f(1) \). This is \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear.
   - If \( f \) and \( g \) agree at \( x = 0 \) but differ at \( x = 1 \), then \( F(f) \neq F(g) \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - An arbitrary \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) does not necessarily depend only on the value of the vector field at a single point. It can depend on the vector field&#x27;s values at multiple points or other global properties.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out whether an R-linear map F from the space of vector fields V on a differentiable manifold X to R, when evaluated at a point x, depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. The question is, if two vector fields f and g agree at a point x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), does it follow that F(f)(x) equals F(g)(x)? 

First, let me recall some definitions. A vector field on a manifold assigns to each point x in X a tangent vector at x. The space V of vector fields can be considered as a module over the ring of smooth functions C^∞(X). But here, the question mentions an R-linear map F: V → R. Wait, but R here is the real numbers. So F is a linear functional on the space of vector fields. But when we talk about F(f)(x), maybe there&#x27;s a confusion here. Wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number, not something that can be evaluated at a point x. That seems contradictory. Maybe there&#x27;s a misinterpretation here.

Wait, perhaps the question is stated slightly differently. Let me check again. &quot;Determine whether for a differentiable manifold X, the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. Specifically, if f, g ∈ V and f(x) = g(x), does it follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)?&quot;

Wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. So F(f)(x) would be like applying F(f) to x, but F(f) is already a real number, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. So maybe the question has a typo or misstatement. Alternatively, perhaps F is a map from V to C^∞(X), the space of smooth functions on X, and being R-linear. Then F(f) would be a function, and evaluating at x would make sense. So maybe the original question was intended that way. Alternatively, perhaps F is a linear functional on V, but then how does evaluation at x come into play?

Alternatively, maybe F is a differential operator or something else. Wait, maybe the problem is about pointwise defined functionals. For example, a linear map F: V → R that is &quot;evaluated&quot; at a point x. But linear maps from V to R are like covectors, but globally defined. Wait, but in differential geometry, a covector field is a section of the cotangent bundle, assigning to each point a linear functional on the tangent space at that point. But here, F is a linear map from vector fields (sections of the tangent bundle) to R. Such objects are typically called covector fields if they are pointwise. But if F is R-linear, that is, linear over real numbers, then it&#x27;s a global functional. 

But then, for example, integration over the manifold of the vector field contracted with some fixed covector field would be an R-linear map, but it depends on the entire vector field, not just its value at a point. On the other hand, if F is a covector at a point x, then it would be evaluation at x followed by applying a covector. But in that case, F would be C^∞(X)-linear if and only if it&#x27;s a covector field. Wait, the problem states that F is R-linear. So for example, a covector field is C^∞(X)-linear, which is a stronger condition. If F is only R-linear, then it doesn&#x27;t necessarily factor through the value at a single point.

So perhaps the question is asking: if F is an R-linear map from vector fields V to real numbers R, does F(f) depend only on f(x) for some fixed x? But in general, no. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y), evaluation at two different points. Then even if f and g agree at x, they might differ at y, so F(f) ≠ F(g). But in this case, F is R-linear. So that would be a counterexample. But the problem says &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Wait, maybe confusion in the wording. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

Then the question would be: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? In that case, the answer is no unless F is C^∞(X)-linear. But since F is only R-linear, it might not be local. For example, take F(f) = [D(f)](x), where D is a differential operator of order 1. Then D(f)(x) depends on the derivative of f at x, which in turn depends on the vector field&#x27;s values in a neighborhood, not just at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it&#x27;s a covector field and F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But since F is only R-linear, it can capture more information.

Hence, the answer is no.

This is R-linear. If f and g agree at x = 0, but differ at x = 1, then F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, even though f(0) = g(0), F(f) ≠ F(g). So in this case, F does not depend only on the value at a single point. Hence, the answer is no.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out whether an R-linear map F from the space of vector fields V on a differentiable manifold X to R, when evaluated at a point x, depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. The question is, if two vector fields f and g agree at a point x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), does it follow that F(f)(x) equals F(g)(x)? 

First, let me recall some definitions. A vector field on a manifold assigns to each point x in X a tangent vector at x. The space V of vector fields can be considered as a module over the ring of smooth functions C^∞(X). But here, the question mentions an R-linear map F: V → R. Wait, but R here is the real numbers. So F is a linear functional on the space of vector fields. But when we talk about F(f)(x), maybe there&#x27;s a confusion here. Wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number, not something that can be evaluated at a point x. That seems contradictory. Maybe there&#x27;s a misinterpretation here.

Wait, perhaps the question is stated slightly differently. Let me check again. &quot;Determine whether for a differentiable manifold X, the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. Specifically, if f, g ∈ V and f(x) = g(x), does it follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)?&quot;

Wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. So F(f)(x) would be like applying F(f) to x, but F(f) is already a real number, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. So maybe the question has a typo or misstatement. Alternatively, perhaps F is a map from V to C^∞(X), the space of smooth functions on X, and being R-linear. Then F(f) would be a function, and evaluating at x would make sense. So maybe the original question was intended that way. Alternatively, perhaps F is a linear functional on V, but then how does evaluation at x come into play?

Alternatively, maybe F is a differential operator or something else. Wait, maybe the problem is about pointwise defined functionals. For example, a linear map F: V → R that is &quot;evaluated&quot; at a point x. But linear maps from V to R are like covectors, but globally defined. Wait, but in differential geometry, a covector field is a section of the cotangent bundle, assigning to each point a linear functional on the tangent space at that point. But here, F is a linear map from vector fields (sections of the tangent bundle) to R. Such objects are typically called covector fields if they are pointwise. But if F is R-linear, that is, linear over real numbers, then it&#x27;s a global functional. 

But then, for example, integration over the manifold of the vector field contracted with some fixed covector field would be an R-linear map, but it depends on the entire vector field, not just its value at a point. On the other hand, if F is a covector at a point x, then it would be evaluation at x followed by applying a covector. But in that case, F would be C^∞(X)-linear if and only if it&#x27;s a covector field. Wait, the problem states that F is R-linear. So for example, a covector field is C^∞(X)-linear, which is a stronger condition. If F is only R-linear, then it doesn&#x27;t necessarily factor through the value at a single point.

So perhaps the question is asking: if F is an R-linear map from vector fields V to real numbers R, does F(f) depend only on f(x) for some fixed x? But in general, no. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y), evaluation at two different points. Then even if f and g agree at x, they might differ at y, so F(f) ≠ F(g). But in this case, F is R-linear. So that would be a counterexample. But the problem says &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Wait, maybe confusion in the wording. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

&quot;Determine whether for a differentiable manifold X, the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. Specifically, if f, g ∈ V and f(x) = g(x), does it follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)?&quot;

Wait, now I see confusion. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. So &quot;F(f)(x)&quot; is trying to evaluate a real number at a point x, which is meaningless. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation here. Alternatively, perhaps F is a map from V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. Then F(f) is a smooth function, and evaluating at x makes sense. Then the question would be: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? In that case, the answer is no unless F is C^∞(X)-linear. But since F is only R-linear, it might not be local. For example, take F(f) = [D(f)](x), where D is a differential operator of order 1. Then D(f)(x) depends on the derivative of f at x, which in turn depends on the vector field&#x27;s values in a neighborhood, not just at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it&#x27;s a covector field and F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But since F is only R-linear, it can capture more information.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about linear functionals on the tangent space at x. But then the tangent space is a vector space, and linear functionals on it are just covectors. But in that case, the question is trivial. But the way it&#x27;s phrased, talking about vector fields and R-linear maps from V to R suggests that F is a global object.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to distributions in the sense of generalized functions, where a distribution is a linear functional on the space of test functions (vector fields here?), but that seems different.

Wait, perhaps there is a standard result here. In differential geometry, any C^∞(X)-linear map from vector fields to smooth functions is equivalent to a section of the cotangent bundle, i.e., a differential 1-form. Such maps are local, meaning that if two vector fields agree on a neighborhood of x, then their images under the map agree at x. However, for merely R-linear maps, this locality is not guaranteed. There is a theorem called the Peetre theorem which states that any linear map between sections of vector bundles which is support-decreasing (i.e., local) is a differential operator. But here, we are dealing with R-linear maps which might not be local. So, for example, an R-linear map could take a vector field, integrate it against some function over the manifold, and return a real number. Such a map would not depend only on the value at a single point x. Therefore, in general, the answer should be no. 

But the problem specifically says &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Wait, if F maps V to R, then F(f) is a real number, not a function, so talking about its value at a point x is nonsensical. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, and F is actually a map from V to C^∞(X), i.e., the space of smooth functions, which is R-linear. Then F(f) is a smooth function, and F(f)(x) is its evaluation at x. In that case, the question is: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? For that, the answer is no unless F is a differential operator of order 0, i.e., a tensor field. If F is a differential operator of order 1, then F(f)(x) can depend on the derivatives of f at x, hence on the vector field&#x27;s behavior near x, not just its value at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it is a tensor field (a covector field), and in that case, F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But if F is only R-linear, then even if f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) might not equal F(g)(x). 

For example, take X = R, V = vector fields on R, which can be identified with C^∞(R). Let F: V → C^∞(R) be the derivative operator, F(f) = f&#x27;. Then F is R-linear. If f and g agree at x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), but have different derivatives at x, then F(f)(x) = f&#x27;(x) ≠ g&#x27;(x) = F(g)(x). Therefore, even though f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) ≠ F(g)(x). Hence, the answer is no.

But wait, in this case, F maps V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. If the original question is about such maps, then the answer is no. However, if F is a covector field, i.e., C^∞(X)-linear, then F(f)(x) depends only on f(x), but since the question specifies R-linear, not C^∞(X)-linear, the answer would be no. 

Alternatively, if F is a map from V to R (real numbers), then as I thought before, F(f) is a real number, so F(f)(x) is ill-defined. So there must be a confusion in the problem statement. However, assuming that the problem meant F: V → C^∞(X) is R-linear, then the answer is no. If the problem indeed states F: V → R, then the question is malformed because F(f) is a real number, not something you can evaluate at x. 

But maybe the problem is in the context of a point x in the manifold, and F is a linear functional on the space of vector fields, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x). In that case, if F is a linear functional that depends only on f(x), then it&#x27;s equivalent to a covector at x. However, there are linear functionals on V that don&#x27;t come from covectors at a single point. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y) for two distinct points x and y. Then F is R-linear, but depends on the values of f at two points. So even if f and g agree at x, if they differ at y, F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, such an F would not satisfy the condition. Therefore, in general, an R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily depend only on the value at a single point. 

However, if the linear map F is also C^∞(X)-linear, then by the tensor characterization lemma (sometimes called the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry), it is equivalent to a covector field, and thus F(f) depends only on f pointwise. But since the problem specifies only R-linearity, the answer is no.

Therefore, the conclusion is that an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily satisfy that F(f) depends only on f(x); it can depend on the behavior of f at other points. Hence, if f and g agree at x, F(f) and F(g) need not be equal. So the answer is no, it does not follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x).

But wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. The problem states &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Maybe there is a misunderstanding here. Perhaps F is supposed to be a function on the manifold that is constructed from the vector field in an R-linear way. But if F is R-linear from V to R, then F(f) is just a real number, not a function on X. So evaluating it at x doesn&#x27;t make sense. Therefore, maybe the problem is misphrased. Alternatively, maybe F is a function that takes a vector field and a point and returns a real number, being linear in the vector field argument for each fixed point. In that case, the question would make sense: is F(-, x): V → R, which is linear, determined solely by the value of the vector field at x. In that interpretation, the answer would still be no, because as before, you can have F(f, x) depend on derivatives of f at x, hence not just f(x). 

Alternatively, if F is required to be a linear map from V to R for each point x, such that F_x(f) depends only on f(x), then each F_x would be a covector at x, and the assignment x ↦ F_x would be a differential 1-form. But the question is whether an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R (for a fixed x?) has this property. 

But given the problem as stated, with possible ambiguities, the most reasonable interpretation is that F is an R-linear map from V to R, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x), in the sense that if f and g agree at x, then F(f) = F(g). But since F maps into R, the real numbers, F(f) is a single real number. So if we fix x, and consider F as a linear functional on V, does F(f) depend only on f(x)? For example, take F(f) = integral over X of some function times f. Then clearly F(f) depends on f over the whole manifold. Alternatively, F(f) could be f(x_0) for a fixed x_0, which only depends on f at x_0. But in general, linear functionals on V can be a combination of evaluations at multiple points or integrals, etc. Therefore, unless F is specifically an evaluation functional at x, it can depend on more than just the value at x. Hence, the answer is no. 

To make it concrete, suppose X is the real line, V is the space of smooth vector fields (which can be identified with smooth functions on R). Let F: V → R be defined by F(f) = f(0) + f(1). This is R-linear. If f and g agree at x = 0, but differ at x = 1, then F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, even though f(0) = g(0), F(f) ≠ F(g). So in this case, F does not depend only on the value at a single point. Hence, the answer is no.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether an \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) at a point \( x \) depends only on the value of the vector field at that point, we need to analyze if \( f(x) = g(x) \) implies \( F(f)(x) = F(g)(x) \).

1. **Definitions and Context**:
   - A vector field on a manifold \( X \) assigns a tangent vector to each point \( x \in X \).
   - The space \( V \) of vector fields is a module over the ring of smooth functions \( C^\infty(X) \).
   - An \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) is a linear functional on the space of vector fields.

2. **Key Considerations**:
   - If \( F \) were \( C^\infty(X) \)-linear, it would correspond to a covector field, and \( F(f)(x) \) would depend only on \( f(x) \). However, \( F \) is only \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear.
   - \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear maps can depend on more than just the value at a single point. For example, they might involve integrals or evaluations at multiple points.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider \( X = \mathbb{R} \) and \( V \) as the space of smooth vector fields (identified with smooth functions).
   - Define \( F(f) = f(0) + f(1) \). This is \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear.
   - If \( f \) and \( g \) agree at \( x = 0 \) but differ at \( x = 1 \), then \( F(f) \neq F(g) \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - An arbitrary \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) does not necessarily depend only on the value of the vector field at a single point. It can depend on the vector field&#x27;s values at multiple points or other global properties.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{No}\).          </p>

For example, take F(f) = integral over X of some function times f. Then clearly F(f) depends on f over the whole manifold. Alternatively, F(f) could be f(x_0) for a fixed x_0, which only depends on f at x_0. But in general, linear functionals on V can be a combination of evaluations at multiple points or integrals, etc. Therefore, unless F is specifically an evaluation functional at x, it can depend on more than just the value at x. Hence, the answer is no. 

To make it concrete, suppose X is the real line, V is the space of smooth vector fields (which can be identified with smooth functions on R). Let F: V → R be defined by F(f) = f(0) + f(1). This is R-linear. If f and g agree at x = 0, but differ at x = 1, then F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, even though f(0) = g(0), F(f) ≠ F(g). So in this case, F does not depend only on the value at a single point. Hence, the answer is no.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}

To determine whether an \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) at a point \( x \) depends only on the value of the vector field at that point, we need to analyze if \( f(x) = g(x) \) implies \( F(f)(x) = F(g)(x) \).

1. **Definitions and Context**:
   - A vector field on a manifold \( X \) assigns a tangent vector to each point \( x \in X \).
   - The space \( V \) of vector fields is a module over the ring of smooth functions \( C^\infty(X) \).
   - An \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) is a linear functional on the space of vector fields.

2. **Key Considerations**:
   - If \( F \) were \( C^\infty(X) \)-linear, it would correspond to a covector field, and \( F(f)(x) \) would depend only on \( f(x) \). However, \( F \) is only \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear.
   - \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear maps can depend on more than just the value at a single point. For example, they might involve integrals or evaluations at multiple points.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider \( X = \mathbb{R} \) and \( V \) as the space of smooth vector fields (identified with smooth functions).
   - Define \( F(f) = f(0) + f(1) \). This is \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear.
   - If \( f \) and \( g \) agree at \( x = 0 \) but differ at \( x = 1 \), then \( F(f) \neq F(g) \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - An arbitrary \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) does not necessarily depend only on the value of the vector field at a single point. It can depend on the vector field&#x27;s values at multiple points or other global properties.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{No}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out whether an R-linear map F from the space of vector fields V on a differentiable manifold X to R, when evaluated at a point x, depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. The question is, if two vector fields f and g agree at a point x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), does it follow that F(f)(x) equals F(g)(x)? 

First, let me recall some definitions. A vector field on a manifold assigns to each point x in X a tangent vector at x. The space V of vector fields can be considered as a module over the ring of smooth functions C^∞(X). But here, the question mentions an R-linear map F: V → R. Wait, but R here is the real numbers. So F is a linear functional on the space of vector fields. But when we talk about F(f)(x), maybe there&#x27;s a confusion here. Wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number, not something that can be evaluated at a point x. That seems contradictory. Maybe there&#x27;s a misinterpretation here.

Wait, perhaps the question is stated slightly differently. Let me check again. &quot;Determine whether for a differentiable manifold X, the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. Specifically, if f, g ∈ V and f(x) = g(x), does it follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)?&quot;

Wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. So F(f)(x) would be like applying F(f) to x, but F(f) is already a real number, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. So maybe the question has a typo or misstatement. Alternatively, perhaps F is a map from V to C^∞(X), the space of smooth functions on X, and being R-linear. Then F(f) would be a function, and evaluating at x would make sense. So maybe the original question was intended that way. Alternatively, perhaps F is a linear functional on V, but then how does evaluation at x come into play?

Alternatively, maybe F is a differential operator or something else. Wait, maybe the problem is about pointwise defined functionals. For example, a linear map F: V → R that is &quot;evaluated&quot; at a point x. But linear maps from V to R are like covectors, but globally defined. Wait, but in differential geometry, a covector field is a section of the cotangent bundle, assigning to each point a linear functional on the tangent space at that point. But here, F is a linear map from vector fields (sections of the tangent bundle) to R. Such objects are typically called covector fields if they are pointwise. But if F is R-linear, that is, linear over real numbers, then it&#x27;s a global functional. 

But then, for example, integration over the manifold of the vector field contracted with some fixed covector field would be an R-linear map, but it depends on the entire vector field, not just its value at a point. On the other hand, if F is a covector at a point x, then it would be evaluation at x followed by applying a covector. But in that case, F would be C^∞(X)-linear if and only if it&#x27;s a covector field. Wait, the problem states that F is R-linear. So for example, a covector field is C^∞(X)-linear, which is a stronger condition. If F is only R-linear, then it doesn&#x27;t necessarily factor through the value at a single point.

So perhaps the question is asking: if F is an R-linear map from vector fields V to real numbers R, does F(f) depend only on f(x) for some fixed x? But in general, no. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y), evaluation at two different points. Then even if f and g agree at x, they might differ at y, so F(f) ≠ F(g). But in this case, F is R-linear. So that would be a counterexample. But the problem says &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Wait, maybe confusion in the wording. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

&quot;Determine whether for a differentiable manifold X, the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. Specifically, if f, g ∈ V and f(x) = g(x), does it follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)?&quot;

Wait, now I see confusion. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. So &quot;F(f)(x)&quot; is trying to evaluate a real number at a point x, which is meaningless. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation here. Alternatively, perhaps F is a map from V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. Then F(f) is a smooth function, and evaluating at x makes sense. Then the question would be: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? In that case, the answer is no unless F is C^∞(X)-linear. But since F is only R-linear, it might not be local. For example, take F(f) = [D(f)](x), where D is a differential operator of order 1. Then D(f)(x) depends on the derivative of f at x, which in turn depends on the vector field&#x27;s values in a neighborhood, not just at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it&#x27;s a covector field and F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But since F is only R-linear, it can capture more information.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about linear functionals on the tangent space at x. But then the tangent space is a vector space, and linear functionals on it are just covectors. But in that case, the question is trivial. But the way it&#x27;s phrased, talking about vector fields and R-linear maps from V to R suggests that F is a global object.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to distributions in the sense of generalized functions, where a distribution is a linear functional on the space of test functions (vector fields here?), but that seems different.

Wait, perhaps there is a standard result here. In differential geometry, any C^∞(X)-linear map from vector fields to smooth functions is equivalent to a section of the cotangent bundle, i.e., a differential 1-form. Such maps are local, meaning that if two vector fields agree on a neighborhood of x, then their images under the map agree at x. However, for merely R-linear maps, this locality is not guaranteed. There is a theorem called the Peetre theorem which states that any linear map between sections of vector bundles which is support-decreasing (i.e., local) is a differential operator. But here, we are dealing with R-linear maps which might not be local. So, for example, an R-linear map could take a vector field, integrate it against some function over the manifold, and return a real number. Such a map would not depend only on the value at a single point x. Therefore, in general, the answer should be no. 

But the problem specifically says &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Wait, if F maps V to R, then F(f) is a real number, not a function, so talking about its value at a point x is nonsensical. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, and F is actually a map from V to C^∞(X), i.e., the space of smooth functions, which is R-linear. Then F(f) is a smooth function, and F(f)(x) is its evaluation at x. In that case, the question is: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? For that, the answer is no unless F is a differential operator of order 0, i.e., a tensor field. If F is a differential operator of order 1, then F(f)(x) can depend on the derivatives of f at x, hence on the vector field&#x27;s behavior near x, not just its value at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it is a tensor field (a covector field), and in that case, F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But if F is only R-linear, then even if f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) might not equal F(g)(x). 

For example, take X = R, V = vector fields on R, which can be identified with C^∞(R). Let F: V → C^∞(R) be the derivative operator, F(f) = f&#x27;. Then F is R-linear. If f and g agree at x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), but have different derivatives at x, then F(f)(x) = f&#x27;(x) ≠ g&#x27;(x) = F(g)(x). Therefore, even though f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) ≠ F(g)(x). Hence, the answer is no.

But wait, in this case, F maps V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. If the original question is about such maps, then the answer is no. However, if F is a covector field, i.e., C^∞(X)-linear, then F(f)(x) depends only on f(x), but since the question specifies R-linear, not C^∞(X)-linear, the answer would be no. 

Alternatively, if F is a map from V to R (real numbers), then as I thought before, F(f) is a real number, so F(f)(x) is ill-defined. So there must be a confusion in the problem statement. However, assuming that the problem meant F: V → C^∞(X) is R-linear, then the answer is no. If the problem indeed states F: V → R, then the question is malformed because F(f) is a real number, not something you can evaluate at x. 

But maybe the problem is in the context of a point x in the manifold, and F is a linear functional on the space of vector fields, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x). In that case, if F is a linear functional that depends only on f(x), then it&#x27;s equivalent to a covector at x. However, there are linear functionals on V that don&#x27;t come from covectors at a single point. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y) for two distinct points x and y. Then F is R-linear, but depends on the values of f at two points. So even if f and g agree at x, if they differ at y, F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, such an F would not satisfy the condition. Therefore, in general, an R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily depend only on the value at a single point. 

However, if the linear map F is also C^∞(X)-linear, then by the tensor characterization lemma (sometimes called the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry), it is equivalent to a covector field, and thus F(f) depends only on f pointwise. But since the problem specifies only R-linearity, the answer is no.

Therefore, the conclusion is that an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily satisfy that F(f) depends only on f(x); it can depend on the behavior of f at other points. Hence, if f and g agree at x, F(f) and F(g) need not be equal. So the answer is no, it does not follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x).

But wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. The problem states &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Maybe there is a misunderstanding here. Perhaps F is supposed to be a function on the manifold that is constructed from the vector field in an R-linear way. But if F is R-linear from V to R, then F(f) is just a real number, not a function on X. So evaluating it at x doesn&#x27;t make sense. Therefore, maybe the problem is misphrased. Alternatively, maybe F is a function that takes a vector field and a point and returns a real number, being linear in the vector field argument for each fixed point. In that case, the question would make sense: is F(-, x): V → R, which is linear, determined solely by the value of the vector field at x. In that interpretation, the answer would still be no, because as before, you can have F(f, x) depend on derivatives of f at x, hence not just f(x). 

Alternatively, if F is required to be a linear map from V to R for each point x, such that F_x(f) depends only on f(x), then each F_x would be a covector at x, and the assignment x ↦ F_x would be a differential 1-form. But the question is whether an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R (for a fixed x?) has this property. 

But given the problem as stated, with possible ambiguities, the most reasonable interpretation is that F is an R-linear map from V to R, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x), in the sense that if f and g agree at x, then F(f) = F(g). But since F maps into R, the real numbers, F(f) is a single real number. So if we fix x, and consider F as a linear functional on V, does F(f) depend only on f(x)? For example, take F(f) = integral over X of some function times f. Then clearly F(f) depends on f over the whole manifold. Alternatively, F(f) could be f(x_0) for a fixed x_0, which only depends on f at x_0. But in general, linear functionals on V can be a combination of evaluations at multiple points or integrals, etc. Therefore, unless F is specifically an evaluation functional at x, it can depend on more than just the value at x. Hence, the answer is no. 

To make it concrete, suppose X is the real line, V is the space of smooth vector fields (which can be identified with smooth functions on R). Let F: V → R be defined by F(f) = f(0) + f(1). This is R-linear. If f and g agree at x = 0, but differ at x = 1, then F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, even though f(0) = g(0), F(f) ≠ F(g). So in this case, F does not depend only on the value at a single point. Hence, the answer is no.

If the problem indeed states F: V → R, then the question is malformed because F(f) is a real number, not something you can evaluate at x. 

But maybe the problem is in the context of a point x in the manifold, and F is a linear functional on the space of vector fields, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x). In that case, if F is a linear functional that depends only on f(x), then it&#x27;s equivalent to a covector at x. However, there are linear functionals on V that don&#x27;t come from covectors at a single point. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y) for two distinct points x and y. Then F is R-linear, but depends on the values of f at two points. So even if f and g agree at x, if they differ at y, F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, such an F would not satisfy the condition. Therefore, in general, an R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily depend only on the value at a single point. 

However, if the linear map F is also C^∞(X)-linear, then by the tensor characterization lemma (sometimes called the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry), it is equivalent to a covector field, and thus F(f) depends only on f pointwise. But since the problem specifies only R-linearity, the answer is no.

Therefore, the conclusion is that an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily satisfy that F(f) depends only on f(x); it can depend on the behavior of f at other points. Hence, if f and g agree at x, F(f) and F(g) need not be equal. So the answer is no, it does not follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x).

But wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. The problem states &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Maybe there is a misunderstanding here. Perhaps F is supposed to be a function on the manifold that is constructed from the vector field in an R-linear way. But if F is R-linear from V to R, then F(f) is just a real number, not a function on X. So evaluating it at x doesn&#x27;t make sense. Therefore, maybe the problem is misphrased. Alternatively, maybe F is a function that takes a vector field and a point and returns a real number, being linear in the vector field argument for each fixed point. In that case, the question would make sense: is F(-, x): V → R, which is linear, determined solely by the value of the vector field at x. In that interpretation, the answer would still be no, because as before, you can have F(f, x) depend on derivatives of f at x, hence not just f(x). 

Alternatively, if F is required to be a linear map from V to R for each point x, such that F_x(f) depends only on f(x), then each F_x would be a covector at x, and the assignment x ↦ F_x would be a differential 1-form. But the question is whether an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R (for a fixed x?) has this property. 

But given the problem as stated, with possible ambiguities, the most reasonable interpretation is that F is an R-linear map from V to R, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x), in the sense that if f and g agree at x, then F(f) = F(g). But since F maps into R, the real numbers, F(f) is a single real number. So if we fix x, and consider F as a linear functional on V, does F(f) depend only on f(x)? For example, take F(f) = integral over X of some function times f. Then clearly F(f) depends on f over the whole manifold. Alternatively, F(f) could be f(x_0) for a fixed x_0, which only depends on f at x_0. But in general, linear functionals on V can be a combination of evaluations at multiple points or integrals, etc. Therefore, unless F is specifically an evaluation functional at x, it can depend on more than just the value at x. Hence, the answer is no. 

To make it concrete, suppose X is the real line, V is the space of smooth vector fields (which can be identified with smooth functions on R). Let F: V → R be defined by F(f) = f(0) + f(1). This is R-linear. If f and g agree at x = 0, but differ at x = 1, then F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, even though f(0) = g(0), F(f) ≠ F(g). So in this case, F does not depend only on the value at a single point. Hence, the answer is no.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether an \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) at a point \( x \) depends only on the value of the vector field at that point, we need to analyze if \( f(x) = g(x) \) implies \( F(f)(x) = F(g)(x) \).

1. **Definitions and Context**:
   - A vector field on a manifold \( X \) assigns a tangent vector to each point \( x \in X \).
   - The space \( V \) of vector fields is a module over the ring of smooth functions \( C^\infty(X) \).
   - An \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) is a linear functional on the space of vector fields.

2. **Key Considerations**:
   - If \( F \) were \( C^\infty(X) \)-linear, it would correspond to a covector field, and \( F(f)(x) \) would depend only on \( f(x) \). However, \( F \) is only \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear.
   - \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear maps can depend on more than just the value at a single point. For example, they might involve integrals or evaluations at multiple points.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider \( X = \mathbb{R} \) and \( V \) as the space of smooth vector fields (identified with smooth functions).
   - Define \( F(f) = f(0) + f(1) \). This is \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear.
   - If \( f \) and \( g \) agree at \( x = 0 \) but differ at \( x = 1 \), then \( F(f) \neq F(g) \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - An arbitrary \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) does not necessarily depend only on the value of the vector field at a single point. It can depend on the vector field&#x27;s values at multiple points or other global properties.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out whether an R-linear map F from the space of vector fields V on a differentiable manifold X to R, when evaluated at a point x, depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. The question is, if two vector fields f and g agree at a point x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), does it follow that F(f)(x) equals F(g)(x)? 

First, let me recall some definitions. A vector field on a manifold assigns to each point x in X a tangent vector at x. The space V of vector fields can be considered as a module over the ring of smooth functions C^∞(X). But here, the question mentions an R-linear map F: V → R. Wait, but R here is the real numbers. So F is a linear functional on the space of vector fields. But when we talk about F(f)(x), maybe there&#x27;s a confusion here. Wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number, not something that can be evaluated at a point x. That seems contradictory. Maybe there&#x27;s a misinterpretation here.

Wait, perhaps the question is stated slightly differently. Let me check again. &quot;Determine whether for a differentiable manifold X, the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. Specifically, if f, g ∈ V and f(x) = g(x), does it follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)?&quot;

Wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. So F(f)(x) would be like applying F(f) to x, but F(f) is already a real number, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. So maybe the question has a typo or misstatement. Alternatively, perhaps F is a map from V to C^∞(X), the space of smooth functions on X, and being R-linear. Then F(f) would be a function, and evaluating at x would make sense. So maybe the original question was intended that way. Alternatively, perhaps F is a linear functional on V, but then how does evaluation at x come into play?

Alternatively, maybe F is a differential operator or something else. Wait, maybe the problem is about pointwise defined functionals. For example, a linear map F: V → R that is &quot;evaluated&quot; at a point x. But linear maps from V to R are like covectors, but globally defined. Wait, but in differential geometry, a covector field is a section of the cotangent bundle, assigning to each point a linear functional on the tangent space at that point. But here, F is a linear map from vector fields (sections of the tangent bundle) to R. Such objects are typically called covector fields if they are pointwise. But if F is R-linear, that is, linear over real numbers, then it&#x27;s a global functional. 

But then, for example, integration over the manifold of the vector field contracted with some fixed covector field would be an R-linear map, but it depends on the entire vector field, not just its value at a point. On the other hand, if F is a covector at a point x, then it would be evaluation at x followed by applying a covector. But in that case, F would be C^∞(X)-linear if and only if it&#x27;s a covector field. Wait, the problem states that F is R-linear. So for example, a covector field is C^∞(X)-linear, which is a stronger condition. If F is only R-linear, then it doesn&#x27;t necessarily factor through the value at a single point.

So perhaps the question is asking: if F is an R-linear map from vector fields V to real numbers R, does F(f) depend only on f(x) for some fixed x? But in general, no. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y), evaluation at two different points. Then even if f and g agree at x, they might differ at y, so F(f) ≠ F(g). But in this case, F is R-linear. So that would be a counterexample. But the problem says &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Wait, maybe confusion in the wording. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

&quot;Determine whether for a differentiable manifold X, the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. Specifically, if f, g ∈ V and f(x) = g(x), does it follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)?&quot;

Wait, now I see confusion. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. So &quot;F(f)(x)&quot; is trying to evaluate a real number at a point x, which is meaningless. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation here. Alternatively, perhaps F is a map from V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. Then F(f) is a smooth function, and evaluating at x makes sense. Then the question would be: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? In that case, the answer is no unless F is C^∞(X)-linear. But since F is only R-linear, it might not be local. For example, take F(f) = [D(f)](x), where D is a differential operator of order 1. Then D(f)(x) depends on the derivative of f at x, which in turn depends on the vector field&#x27;s values in a neighborhood, not just at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it&#x27;s a covector field and F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But since F is only R-linear, it can capture more information.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about linear functionals on the tangent space at x. But then the tangent space is a vector space, and linear functionals on it are just covectors. But in that case, the question is trivial. But the way it&#x27;s phrased, talking about vector fields and R-linear maps from V to R suggests that F is a global object.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to distributions in the sense of generalized functions, where a distribution is a linear functional on the space of test functions (vector fields here?), but that seems different.

Wait, perhaps there is a standard result here. In differential geometry, any C^∞(X)-linear map from vector fields to smooth functions is equivalent to a section of the cotangent bundle, i.e., a differential 1-form. Such maps are local, meaning that if two vector fields agree on a neighborhood of x, then their images under the map agree at x. However, for merely R-linear maps, this locality is not guaranteed. There is a theorem called the Peetre theorem which states that any linear map between sections of vector bundles which is support-decreasing (i.e., local) is a differential operator. But here, we are dealing with R-linear maps which might not be local. So, for example, an R-linear map could take a vector field, integrate it against some function over the manifold, and return a real number. Such a map would not depend only on the value at a single point x. Therefore, in general, the answer should be no. 

But the problem specifically says &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Wait, if F maps V to R, then F(f) is a real number, not a function, so talking about its value at a point x is nonsensical. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, and F is actually a map from V to C^∞(X), i.e., the space of smooth functions, which is R-linear. Then F(f) is a smooth function, and F(f)(x) is its evaluation at x. In that case, the question is: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? For that, the answer is no unless F is a differential operator of order 0, i.e., a tensor field. If F is a differential operator of order 1, then F(f)(x) can depend on the derivatives of f at x, hence on the vector field&#x27;s behavior near x, not just its value at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it is a tensor field (a covector field), and in that case, F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But if F is only R-linear, then even if f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) might not equal F(g)(x). 

For example, take X = R, V = vector fields on R, which can be identified with C^∞(R). Let F: V → C^∞(R) be the derivative operator, F(f) = f&#x27;. Then F is R-linear. If f and g agree at x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), but have different derivatives at x, then F(f)(x) = f&#x27;(x) ≠ g&#x27;(x) = F(g)(x). Therefore, even though f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) ≠ F(g)(x). Hence, the answer is no.

But wait, in this case, F maps V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. If the original question is about such maps, then the answer is no. However, if F is a covector field, i.e., C^∞(X)-linear, then F(f)(x) depends only on f(x), but since the question specifies R-linear, not C^∞(X)-linear, the answer would be no. 

Alternatively, if F is a map from V to R (real numbers), then as I thought before, F(f) is a real number, so F(f)(x) is ill-defined. So there must be a confusion in the problem statement. However, assuming that the problem meant F: V → C^∞(X) is R-linear, then the answer is no. If the problem indeed states F: V → R, then the question is malformed because F(f) is a real number, not something you can evaluate at x. 

But maybe the problem is in the context of a point x in the manifold, and F is a linear functional on the space of vector fields, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x). In that case, if F is a linear functional that depends only on f(x), then it&#x27;s equivalent to a covector at x. However, there are linear functionals on V that don&#x27;t come from covectors at a single point. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y) for two distinct points x and y. Then F is R-linear, but depends on the values of f at two points. So even if f and g agree at x, if they differ at y, F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, such an F would not satisfy the condition. Therefore, in general, an R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily depend only on the value at a single point. 

However, if the linear map F is also C^∞(X)-linear, then by the tensor characterization lemma (sometimes called the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry), it is equivalent to a covector field, and thus F(f) depends only on f pointwise. But since the problem specifies only R-linearity, the answer is no.

Therefore, the conclusion is that an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily satisfy that F(f) depends only on f(x); it can depend on the behavior of f at other points. Hence, if f and g agree at x, F(f) and F(g) need not be equal. So the answer is no, it does not follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x).

But wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. The problem states &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Maybe there is a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, maybe F is a function that takes a vector field and a point and returns a real number, being linear in the vector field argument for each fixed point.

In that interpretation, the answer would still be no, because as before, you can have F(f, x) depend on derivatives of f at x, hence not just f(x). 

Alternatively, if F is required to be a linear map from V to R for each point x, such that F_x(f) depends only on f(x), then each F_x would be a covector at x, and the assignment x ↦ F_x would be a differential 1-form. But the question is whether an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R (for a fixed x?) has this property. 

But given the problem as stated, with possible ambiguities, the most reasonable interpretation is that F is an R-linear map from V to R, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x), in the sense that if f and g agree at x, then F(f) = F(g).

For example, take F(f) = integral over X of some function times f. Then clearly F(f) depends on f over the whole manifold. Alternatively, F(f) could be f(x_0) for a fixed x_0, which only depends on f at x_0. But in general, linear functionals on V can be a combination of evaluations at multiple points or integrals, etc. Therefore, unless F is specifically an evaluation functional at x, it can depend on more than just the value at x. Hence, the answer is no.

This is R-linear. If f and g agree at x = 0, but differ at x = 1, then F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, even though f(0) = g(0), F(f) ≠ F(g). So in this case, F does not depend only on the value at a single point. Hence, the answer is no.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about linear functionals on the tangent space at x. But then the tangent space is a vector space, and linear functionals on it are just covectors. But in that case, the question is trivial. But the way it&#x27;s phrased, talking about vector fields and R-linear maps from V to R suggests that F is a global object.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to distributions in the sense of generalized functions, where a distribution is a linear functional on the space of test functions (vector fields here?), but that seems different.

Wait, perhaps there is a standard result here. In differential geometry, any C^∞(X)-linear map from vector fields to smooth functions is equivalent to a section of the cotangent bundle, i.e., a differential 1-form. Such maps are local, meaning that if two vector fields agree on a neighborhood of x, then their images under the map agree at x. However, for merely R-linear maps, this locality is not guaranteed. There is a theorem called the Peetre theorem which states that any linear map between sections of vector bundles which is support-decreasing (i.e., local) is a differential operator. But here, we are dealing with R-linear maps which might not be local. So, for example, an R-linear map could take a vector field, integrate it against some function over the manifold, and return a real number. Such a map would not depend only on the value at a single point x. Therefore, in general, the answer should be no. 

But the problem specifically says &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Wait, if F maps V to R, then F(f) is a real number, not a function, so talking about its value at a point x is nonsensical. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, and F is actually a map from V to C^∞(X), i.e., the space of smooth functions, which is R-linear. Then F(f) is a smooth function, and F(f)(x) is its evaluation at x. In that case, the question is: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? For that, the answer is no unless F is a differential operator of order 0, i.e., a tensor field. If F is a differential operator of order 1, then F(f)(x) can depend on the derivatives of f at x, hence on the vector field&#x27;s behavior near x, not just its value at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it is a tensor field (a covector field), and in that case, F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But if F is only R-linear, then even if f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) might not equal F(g)(x). 

For example, take X = R, V = vector fields on R, which can be identified with C^∞(R). Let F: V → C^∞(R) be the derivative operator, F(f) = f&#x27;. Then F is R-linear. If f and g agree at x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), but have different derivatives at x, then F(f)(x) = f&#x27;(x) ≠ g&#x27;(x) = F(g)(x). Therefore, even though f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) ≠ F(g)(x). Hence, the answer is no.

But wait, in this case, F maps V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. If the original question is about such maps, then the answer is no. However, if F is a covector field, i.e., C^∞(X)-linear, then F(f)(x) depends only on f(x), but since the question specifies R-linear, not C^∞(X)-linear, the answer would be no. 

Alternatively, if F is a map from V to R (real numbers), then as I thought before, F(f) is a real number, so F(f)(x) is ill-defined. So there must be a confusion in the problem statement. However, assuming that the problem meant F: V → C^∞(X) is R-linear, then the answer is no. If the problem indeed states F: V → R, then the question is malformed because F(f) is a real number, not something you can evaluate at x. 

But maybe the problem is in the context of a point x in the manifold, and F is a linear functional on the space of vector fields, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x). In that case, if F is a linear functional that depends only on f(x), then it&#x27;s equivalent to a covector at x. However, there are linear functionals on V that don&#x27;t come from covectors at a single point. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y) for two distinct points x and y. Then F is R-linear, but depends on the values of f at two points. So even if f and g agree at x, if they differ at y, F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, such an F would not satisfy the condition. Therefore, in general, an R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily depend only on the value at a single point. 

However, if the linear map F is also C^∞(X)-linear, then by the tensor characterization lemma (sometimes called the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry), it is equivalent to a covector field, and thus F(f) depends only on f pointwise. But since the problem specifies only R-linearity, the answer is no.

Therefore, the conclusion is that an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily satisfy that F(f) depends only on f(x); it can depend on the behavior of f at other points. Hence, if f and g agree at x, F(f) and F(g) need not be equal. So the answer is no, it does not follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x).

But wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. The problem states &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Maybe there is a misunderstanding here. Perhaps F is supposed to be a function on the manifold that is constructed from the vector field in an R-linear way. But if F is R-linear from V to R, then F(f) is just a real number, not a function on X. So evaluating it at x doesn&#x27;t make sense. Therefore, maybe the problem is misphrased. Alternatively, maybe F is a function that takes a vector field and a point and returns a real number, being linear in the vector field argument for each fixed point. In that case, the question would make sense: is F(-, x): V → R, which is linear, determined solely by the value of the vector field at x. In that interpretation, the answer would still be no, because as before, you can have F(f, x) depend on derivatives of f at x, hence not just f(x). 

Alternatively, if F is required to be a linear map from V to R for each point x, such that F_x(f) depends only on f(x), then each F_x would be a covector at x, and the assignment x ↦ F_x would be a differential 1-form. But the question is whether an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R (for a fixed x?) has this property. 

But given the problem as stated, with possible ambiguities, the most reasonable interpretation is that F is an R-linear map from V to R, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x), in the sense that if f and g agree at x, then F(f) = F(g). But since F maps into R, the real numbers, F(f) is a single real number. So if we fix x, and consider F as a linear functional on V, does F(f) depend only on f(x)? For example, take F(f) = integral over X of some function times f. Then clearly F(f) depends on f over the whole manifold. Alternatively, F(f) could be f(x_0) for a fixed x_0, which only depends on f at x_0. But in general, linear functionals on V can be a combination of evaluations at multiple points or integrals, etc. Therefore, unless F is specifically an evaluation functional at x, it can depend on more than just the value at x. Hence, the answer is no. 

To make it concrete, suppose X is the real line, V is the space of smooth vector fields (which can be identified with smooth functions on R). Let F: V → R be defined by F(f) = f(0) + f(1). This is R-linear. If f and g agree at x = 0, but differ at x = 1, then F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, even though f(0) = g(0), F(f) ≠ F(g). So in this case, F does not depend only on the value at a single point. Hence, the answer is no.

To determine whether an \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) at a point \( x \) depends only on the value of the vector field at that point, we need to analyze if \( f(x) = g(x) \) implies \( F(f)(x) = F(g)(x) \).

1. **Definitions and Context**:
   - A vector field on a manifold \( X \) assigns a tangent vector to each point \( x \in X \).
   - The space \( V \) of vector fields is a module over the ring of smooth functions \( C^\infty(X) \).
   - An \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) is a linear functional on the space of vector fields.

2. **Key Considerations**:
   - If \( F \) were \( C^\infty(X) \)-linear, it would correspond to a covector field, and \( F(f)(x) \) would depend only on \( f(x) \). However, \( F \) is only \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear.
   - \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear maps can depend on more than just the value at a single point. For example, they might involve integrals or evaluations at multiple points.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider \( X = \mathbb{R} \) and \( V \) as the space of smooth vector fields (identified with smooth functions).
   - Define \( F(f) = f(0) + f(1) \). This is \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear.
   - If \( f \) and \( g \) agree at \( x = 0 \) but differ at \( x = 1 \), then \( F(f) \neq F(g) \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - An arbitrary \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) does not necessarily depend only on the value of the vector field at a single point. It can depend on the vector field&#x27;s values at multiple points or other global properties.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out whether an R-linear map F from the space of vector fields V on a differentiable manifold X to R, when evaluated at a point x, depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. The question is, if two vector fields f and g agree at a point x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), does it follow that F(f)(x) equals F(g)(x)? 

First, let me recall some definitions. A vector field on a manifold assigns to each point x in X a tangent vector at x. The space V of vector fields can be considered as a module over the ring of smooth functions C^∞(X). But here, the question mentions an R-linear map F: V → R. Wait, but R here is the real numbers. So F is a linear functional on the space of vector fields. But when we talk about F(f)(x), maybe there&#x27;s a confusion here. Wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number, not something that can be evaluated at a point x. That seems contradictory. Maybe there&#x27;s a misinterpretation here.

Wait, perhaps the question is stated slightly differently. Let me check again. &quot;Determine whether for a differentiable manifold X, the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. Specifically, if f, g ∈ V and f(x) = g(x), does it follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)?&quot;

Wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. So F(f)(x) would be like applying F(f) to x, but F(f) is already a real number, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. So maybe the question has a typo or misstatement. Alternatively, perhaps F is a map from V to C^∞(X), the space of smooth functions on X, and being R-linear. Then F(f) would be a function, and evaluating at x would make sense. So maybe the original question was intended that way. Alternatively, perhaps F is a linear functional on V, but then how does evaluation at x come into play?

Alternatively, maybe F is a differential operator or something else. Wait, maybe the problem is about pointwise defined functionals. For example, a linear map F: V → R that is &quot;evaluated&quot; at a point x. But linear maps from V to R are like covectors, but globally defined. Wait, but in differential geometry, a covector field is a section of the cotangent bundle, assigning to each point a linear functional on the tangent space at that point. But here, F is a linear map from vector fields (sections of the tangent bundle) to R. Such objects are typically called covector fields if they are pointwise. But if F is R-linear, that is, linear over real numbers, then it&#x27;s a global functional. 

But then, for example, integration over the manifold of the vector field contracted with some fixed covector field would be an R-linear map, but it depends on the entire vector field, not just its value at a point. On the other hand, if F is a covector at a point x, then it would be evaluation at x followed by applying a covector. But in that case, F would be C^∞(X)-linear if and only if it&#x27;s a covector field. Wait, the problem states that F is R-linear. So for example, a covector field is C^∞(X)-linear, which is a stronger condition. If F is only R-linear, then it doesn&#x27;t necessarily factor through the value at a single point.

So perhaps the question is asking: if F is an R-linear map from vector fields V to real numbers R, does F(f) depend only on f(x) for some fixed x? But in general, no. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y), evaluation at two different points. Then even if f and g agree at x, they might differ at y, so F(f) ≠ F(g). But in this case, F is R-linear. So that would be a counterexample. But the problem says &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Wait, maybe confusion in the wording. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

&quot;Determine whether for a differentiable manifold X, the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. Specifically, if f, g ∈ V and f(x) = g(x), does it follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)?&quot;

Wait, now I see confusion. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. So &quot;F(f)(x)&quot; is trying to evaluate a real number at a point x, which is meaningless. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation here. Alternatively, perhaps F is a map from V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. Then F(f) is a smooth function, and evaluating at x makes sense. Then the question would be: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? In that case, the answer is no unless F is C^∞(X)-linear. But since F is only R-linear, it might not be local. For example, take F(f) = [D(f)](x), where D is a differential operator of order 1. Then D(f)(x) depends on the derivative of f at x, which in turn depends on the vector field&#x27;s values in a neighborhood, not just at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it&#x27;s a covector field and F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But since F is only R-linear, it can capture more information.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about linear functionals on the tangent space at x. But then the tangent space is a vector space, and linear functionals on it are just covectors. But in that case, the question is trivial. But the way it&#x27;s phrased, talking about vector fields and R-linear maps from V to R suggests that F is a global object.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to distributions in the sense of generalized functions, where a distribution is a linear functional on the space of test functions (vector fields here?), but that seems different.

In differential geometry, any C^∞(X)-linear map from vector fields to smooth functions is equivalent to a section of the cotangent bundle, i.e., a differential 1-form.

If f and g agree at x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), but have different derivatives at x, then F(f)(x) = f&#x27;(x) ≠ g&#x27;(x) = F(g)(x). Therefore, even though f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) ≠ F(g)(x). Hence, the answer is no.

But wait, in this case, F maps V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. If the original question is about such maps, then the answer is no.

So in this case, F does not depend only on the value at a single point. Hence, the answer is no.

Wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. So F(f)(x) would be like applying F(f) to x, but F(f) is already a real number, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. So maybe the question has a typo or misstatement. Alternatively, perhaps F is a map from V to C^∞(X), the space of smooth functions on X, and being R-linear. Then F(f) would be a function, and evaluating at x would make sense. So maybe the original question was intended that way. Alternatively, perhaps F is a linear functional on V, but then how does evaluation at x come into play?

Alternatively, maybe F is a differential operator or something else. Wait, maybe the problem is about pointwise defined functionals. For example, a linear map F: V → R that is &quot;evaluated&quot; at a point x. But linear maps from V to R are like covectors, but globally defined. Wait, but in differential geometry, a covector field is a section of the cotangent bundle, assigning to each point a linear functional on the tangent space at that point. But here, F is a linear map from vector fields (sections of the tangent bundle) to R. Such objects are typically called covector fields if they are pointwise. But if F is R-linear, that is, linear over real numbers, then it&#x27;s a global functional. 

But then, for example, integration over the manifold of the vector field contracted with some fixed covector field would be an R-linear map, but it depends on the entire vector field, not just its value at a point. On the other hand, if F is a covector at a point x, then it would be evaluation at x followed by applying a covector. But in that case, F would be C^∞(X)-linear if and only if it&#x27;s a covector field. Wait, the problem states that F is R-linear. So for example, a covector field is C^∞(X)-linear, which is a stronger condition. If F is only R-linear, then it doesn&#x27;t necessarily factor through the value at a single point.

So perhaps the question is asking: if F is an R-linear map from vector fields V to real numbers R, does F(f) depend only on f(x) for some fixed x? But in general, no. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y), evaluation at two different points. Then even if f and g agree at x, they might differ at y, so F(f) ≠ F(g). But in this case, F is R-linear. So that would be a counterexample. But the problem says &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Wait, maybe confusion in the wording. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

&quot;Determine whether for a differentiable manifold X, the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. Specifically, if f, g ∈ V and f(x) = g(x), does it follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)?&quot;

Wait, now I see confusion. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. So &quot;F(f)(x)&quot; is trying to evaluate a real number at a point x, which is meaningless. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation here. Alternatively, perhaps F is a map from V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. Then F(f) is a smooth function, and evaluating at x makes sense. Then the question would be: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? In that case, the answer is no unless F is C^∞(X)-linear. But since F is only R-linear, it might not be local. For example, take F(f) = [D(f)](x), where D is a differential operator of order 1. Then D(f)(x) depends on the derivative of f at x, which in turn depends on the vector field&#x27;s values in a neighborhood, not just at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it&#x27;s a covector field and F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But since F is only R-linear, it can capture more information.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about linear functionals on the tangent space at x. But then the tangent space is a vector space, and linear functionals on it are just covectors. But in that case, the question is trivial. But the way it&#x27;s phrased, talking about vector fields and R-linear maps from V to R suggests that F is a global object.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to distributions in the sense of generalized functions, where a distribution is a linear functional on the space of test functions (vector fields here?), but that seems different.

Wait, perhaps there is a standard result here. In differential geometry, any C^∞(X)-linear map from vector fields to smooth functions is equivalent to a section of the cotangent bundle, i.e., a differential 1-form. Such maps are local, meaning that if two vector fields agree on a neighborhood of x, then their images under the map agree at x. However, for merely R-linear maps, this locality is not guaranteed. There is a theorem called the Peetre theorem which states that any linear map between sections of vector bundles which is support-decreasing (i.e., local) is a differential operator. But here, we are dealing with R-linear maps which might not be local. So, for example, an R-linear map could take a vector field, integrate it against some function over the manifold, and return a real number. Such a map would not depend only on the value at a single point x. Therefore, in general, the answer should be no. 

But the problem specifically says &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Wait, if F maps V to R, then F(f) is a real number, not a function, so talking about its value at a point x is nonsensical. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, and F is actually a map from V to C^∞(X), i.e., the space of smooth functions, which is R-linear. Then F(f) is a smooth function, and F(f)(x) is its evaluation at x. In that case, the question is: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? For that, the answer is no unless F is a differential operator of order 0, i.e., a tensor field. If F is a differential operator of order 1, then F(f)(x) can depend on the derivatives of f at x, hence on the vector field&#x27;s behavior near x, not just its value at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it is a tensor field (a covector field), and in that case, F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But if F is only R-linear, then even if f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) might not equal F(g)(x). 

For example, take X = R, V = vector fields on R, which can be identified with C^∞(R). Let F: V → C^∞(R) be the derivative operator, F(f) = f&#x27;. Then F is R-linear. If f and g agree at x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), but have different derivatives at x, then F(f)(x) = f&#x27;(x) ≠ g&#x27;(x) = F(g)(x). Therefore, even though f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) ≠ F(g)(x). Hence, the answer is no.

But wait, in this case, F maps V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. If the original question is about such maps, then the answer is no. However, if F is a covector field, i.e., C^∞(X)-linear, then F(f)(x) depends only on f(x), but since the question specifies R-linear, not C^∞(X)-linear, the answer would be no. 

Alternatively, if F is a map from V to R (real numbers), then as I thought before, F(f) is a real number, so F(f)(x) is ill-defined. So there must be a confusion in the problem statement. However, assuming that the problem meant F: V → C^∞(X) is R-linear, then the answer is no. If the problem indeed states F: V → R, then the question is malformed because F(f) is a real number, not something you can evaluate at x. 

But maybe the problem is in the context of a point x in the manifold, and F is a linear functional on the space of vector fields, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x). In that case, if F is a linear functional that depends only on f(x), then it&#x27;s equivalent to a covector at x. However, there are linear functionals on V that don&#x27;t come from covectors at a single point. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y) for two distinct points x and y. Then F is R-linear, but depends on the values of f at two points. So even if f and g agree at x, if they differ at y, F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, such an F would not satisfy the condition. Therefore, in general, an R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily depend only on the value at a single point. 

However, if the linear map F is also C^∞(X)-linear, then by the tensor characterization lemma (sometimes called the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry), it is equivalent to a covector field, and thus F(f) depends only on f pointwise. But since the problem specifies only R-linearity, the answer is no.

Therefore, the conclusion is that an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily satisfy that F(f) depends only on f(x); it can depend on the behavior of f at other points. Hence, if f and g agree at x, F(f) and F(g) need not be equal. So the answer is no, it does not follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x).

But wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. The problem states &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Maybe there is a misunderstanding here. Perhaps F is supposed to be a function on the manifold that is constructed from the vector field in an R-linear way. But if F is R-linear from V to R, then F(f) is just a real number, not a function on X. So evaluating it at x doesn&#x27;t make sense. Therefore, maybe the problem is misphrased. Alternatively, maybe F is a function that takes a vector field and a point and returns a real number, being linear in the vector field argument for each fixed point. In that case, the question would make sense: is F(-, x): V → R, which is linear, determined solely by the value of the vector field at x. In that interpretation, the answer would still be no, because as before, you can have F(f, x) depend on derivatives of f at x, hence not just f(x). 

Alternatively, if F is required to be a linear map from V to R for each point x, such that F_x(f) depends only on f(x), then each F_x would be a covector at x, and the assignment x ↦ F_x would be a differential 1-form. But the question is whether an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R (for a fixed x?) has this property. 

But given the problem as stated, with possible ambiguities, the most reasonable interpretation is that F is an R-linear map from V to R, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x), in the sense that if f and g agree at x, then F(f) = F(g). But since F maps into R, the real numbers, F(f) is a single real number. So if we fix x, and consider F as a linear functional on V, does F(f) depend only on f(x)? For example, take F(f) = integral over X of some function times f. Then clearly F(f) depends on f over the whole manifold. Alternatively, F(f) could be f(x_0) for a fixed x_0, which only depends on f at x_0. But in general, linear functionals on V can be a combination of evaluations at multiple points or integrals, etc. Therefore, unless F is specifically an evaluation functional at x, it can depend on more than just the value at x. Hence, the answer is no. 

To make it concrete, suppose X is the real line, V is the space of smooth vector fields (which can be identified with smooth functions on R). Let F: V → R be defined by F(f) = f(0) + f(1). This is R-linear. If f and g agree at x = 0, but differ at x = 1, then F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, even though f(0) = g(0), F(f) ≠ F(g). So in this case, F does not depend only on the value at a single point. Hence, the answer is no.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether an \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) at a point \( x \) depends only on the value of the vector field at that point, we need to analyze if \( f(x) = g(x) \) implies \( F(f)(x) = F(g)(x) \).

1. **Definitions and Context**:
   - A vector field on a manifold \( X \) assigns a tangent vector to each point \( x \in X \).
   - The space \( V \) of vector fields is a module over the ring of smooth functions \( C^\infty(X) \).
   - An \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) is a linear functional on the space of vector fields.

2. **Key Considerations**:
   - If \( F \) were \( C^\infty(X) \)-linear, it would correspond to a covector field, and \( F(f)(x) \) would depend only on \( f(x) \). However, \( F \) is only \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear.
   - \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear maps can depend on more than just the value at a single point. For example, they might involve integrals or evaluations at multiple points.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider \( X = \mathbb{R} \) and \( V \) as the space of smooth vector fields (identified with smooth functions).
   - Define \( F(f) = f(0) + f(1) \). This is \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear.
   - If \( f \) and \( g \) agree at \( x = 0 \) but differ at \( x = 1 \), then \( F(f) \neq F(g) \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - An arbitrary \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) does not necessarily depend only on the value of the vector field at a single point. It can depend on the vector field&#x27;s values at multiple points or other global properties.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out whether an R-linear map F from the space of vector fields V on a differentiable manifold X to R, when evaluated at a point x, depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. The question is, if two vector fields f and g agree at a point x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), does it follow that F(f)(x) equals F(g)(x)? 

First, let me recall some definitions. A vector field on a manifold assigns to each point x in X a tangent vector at x. The space V of vector fields can be considered as a module over the ring of smooth functions C^∞(X). But here, the question mentions an R-linear map F: V → R. Wait, but R here is the real numbers. So F is a linear functional on the space of vector fields. But when we talk about F(f)(x), maybe there&#x27;s a confusion here. Wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number, not something that can be evaluated at a point x. That seems contradictory. Maybe there&#x27;s a misinterpretation here.

Wait, perhaps the question is stated slightly differently. Let me check again. &quot;Determine whether for a differentiable manifold X, the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. Specifically, if f, g ∈ V and f(x) = g(x), does it follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)?&quot;

Alternatively, maybe F is a differential operator or something else. Wait, maybe the problem is about pointwise defined functionals. For example, a linear map F: V → R that is &quot;evaluated&quot; at a point x. But linear maps from V to R are like covectors, but globally defined.

This is R-linear. If f and g agree at x = 0, but differ at x = 1, then F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, even though f(0) = g(0), F(f) ≠ F(g). So in this case, F does not depend only on the value at a single point. Hence, the answer is no.

   - If \( F \) were \( C^\infty(X) \)-linear, it would correspond to a covector field, and \( F(f)(x) \) would depend only on \( f(x) \). However, \( F \) is only \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear.
   - \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear maps can depend on more than just the value at a single point. For example, they might involve integrals or evaluations at multiple points.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider \( X = \mathbb{R} \) and \( V \) as the space of smooth vector fields (identified with smooth functions).
   - Define \( F(f) = f(0) + f(1) \). This is \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear.
   - If \( f \) and \( g \) agree at \( x = 0 \) but differ at \( x = 1 \), then \( F(f) \neq F(g) \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - An arbitrary \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) does not necessarily depend only on the value of the vector field at a single point. It can depend on the vector field&#x27;s values at multiple points or other global properties.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{No}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out whether an R-linear map F from the space of vector fields V on a differentiable manifold X to R, when evaluated at a point x, depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. The question is, if two vector fields f and g agree at a point x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), does it follow that F(f)(x) equals F(g)(x)? 

First, let me recall some definitions. A vector field on a manifold assigns to each point x in X a tangent vector at x. The space V of vector fields can be considered as a module over the ring of smooth functions C^∞(X). But here, the question mentions an R-linear map F: V → R. Wait, but R here is the real numbers. So F is a linear functional on the space of vector fields. But when we talk about F(f)(x), maybe there&#x27;s a confusion here. Wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number, not something that can be evaluated at a point x. That seems contradictory. Maybe there&#x27;s a misinterpretation here.

Wait, perhaps the question is stated slightly differently. Let me check again. &quot;Determine whether for a differentiable manifold X, the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. Specifically, if f, g ∈ V and f(x) = g(x), does it follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)?&quot;

Wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. So F(f)(x) would be like applying F(f) to x, but F(f) is already a real number, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. So maybe the question has a typo or misstatement. Alternatively, perhaps F is a map from V to C^∞(X), the space of smooth functions on X, and being R-linear. Then F(f) would be a function, and evaluating at x would make sense. So maybe the original question was intended that way. Alternatively, perhaps F is a linear functional on V, but then how does evaluation at x come into play?

Alternatively, maybe F is a differential operator or something else. Wait, maybe the problem is about pointwise defined functionals. For example, a linear map F: V → R that is &quot;evaluated&quot; at a point x. But linear maps from V to R are like covectors, but globally defined. Wait, but in differential geometry, a covector field is a section of the cotangent bundle, assigning to each point a linear functional on the tangent space at that point. But here, F is a linear map from vector fields (sections of the tangent bundle) to R. Such objects are typically called covector fields if they are pointwise. But if F is R-linear, that is, linear over real numbers, then it&#x27;s a global functional. 

But then, for example, integration over the manifold of the vector field contracted with some fixed covector field would be an R-linear map, but it depends on the entire vector field, not just its value at a point. On the other hand, if F is a covector at a point x, then it would be evaluation at x followed by applying a covector. But in that case, F would be C^∞(X)-linear if and only if it&#x27;s a covector field. Wait, the problem states that F is R-linear. So for example, a covector field is C^∞(X)-linear, which is a stronger condition. If F is only R-linear, then it doesn&#x27;t necessarily factor through the value at a single point.

So perhaps the question is asking: if F is an R-linear map from vector fields V to real numbers R, does F(f) depend only on f(x) for some fixed x? But in general, no. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y), evaluation at two different points. Then even if f and g agree at x, they might differ at y, so F(f) ≠ F(g). But in this case, F is R-linear. So that would be a counterexample. But the problem says &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Wait, maybe confusion in the wording. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

&quot;Determine whether for a differentiable manifold X, the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x depends only on the value of the vector field at that point. Specifically, if f, g ∈ V and f(x) = g(x), does it follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)?&quot;

Wait, now I see confusion. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. So &quot;F(f)(x)&quot; is trying to evaluate a real number at a point x, which is meaningless. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation here. Alternatively, perhaps F is a map from V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. Then F(f) is a smooth function, and evaluating at x makes sense. Then the question would be: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? In that case, the answer is no unless F is C^∞(X)-linear. But since F is only R-linear, it might not be local. For example, take F(f) = [D(f)](x), where D is a differential operator of order 1. Then D(f)(x) depends on the derivative of f at x, which in turn depends on the vector field&#x27;s values in a neighborhood, not just at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it&#x27;s a covector field and F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But since F is only R-linear, it can capture more information.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about linear functionals on the tangent space at x. But then the tangent space is a vector space, and linear functionals on it are just covectors. But in that case, the question is trivial. But the way it&#x27;s phrased, talking about vector fields and R-linear maps from V to R suggests that F is a global object.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to distributions in the sense of generalized functions, where a distribution is a linear functional on the space of test functions (vector fields here?), but that seems different.

Wait, perhaps there is a standard result here. In differential geometry, any C^∞(X)-linear map from vector fields to smooth functions is equivalent to a section of the cotangent bundle, i.e., a differential 1-form. Such maps are local, meaning that if two vector fields agree on a neighborhood of x, then their images under the map agree at x. However, for merely R-linear maps, this locality is not guaranteed. There is a theorem called the Peetre theorem which states that any linear map between sections of vector bundles which is support-decreasing (i.e., local) is a differential operator. But here, we are dealing with R-linear maps which might not be local. So, for example, an R-linear map could take a vector field, integrate it against some function over the manifold, and return a real number. Such a map would not depend only on the value at a single point x. Therefore, in general, the answer should be no. 

But the problem specifically says &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Wait, if F maps V to R, then F(f) is a real number, not a function, so talking about its value at a point x is nonsensical. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, and F is actually a map from V to C^∞(X), i.e., the space of smooth functions, which is R-linear. Then F(f) is a smooth function, and F(f)(x) is its evaluation at x. In that case, the question is: if f and g agree at x, does F(f)(x) = F(g)(x)? For that, the answer is no unless F is a differential operator of order 0, i.e., a tensor field. If F is a differential operator of order 1, then F(f)(x) can depend on the derivatives of f at x, hence on the vector field&#x27;s behavior near x, not just its value at x. But if F is C^∞(X)-linear, then it is a tensor field (a covector field), and in that case, F(f)(x) depends only on f(x). But if F is only R-linear, then even if f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) might not equal F(g)(x). 

For example, take X = R, V = vector fields on R, which can be identified with C^∞(R). Let F: V → C^∞(R) be the derivative operator, F(f) = f&#x27;. Then F is R-linear. If f and g agree at x (i.e., f(x) = g(x)), but have different derivatives at x, then F(f)(x) = f&#x27;(x) ≠ g&#x27;(x) = F(g)(x). Therefore, even though f(x) = g(x), F(f)(x) ≠ F(g)(x). Hence, the answer is no.

But wait, in this case, F maps V to C^∞(X), which is R-linear. If the original question is about such maps, then the answer is no. However, if F is a covector field, i.e., C^∞(X)-linear, then F(f)(x) depends only on f(x), but since the question specifies R-linear, not C^∞(X)-linear, the answer would be no. 

Alternatively, if F is a map from V to R (real numbers), then as I thought before, F(f) is a real number, so F(f)(x) is ill-defined. So there must be a confusion in the problem statement. However, assuming that the problem meant F: V → C^∞(X) is R-linear, then the answer is no. If the problem indeed states F: V → R, then the question is malformed because F(f) is a real number, not something you can evaluate at x. 

But maybe the problem is in the context of a point x in the manifold, and F is a linear functional on the space of vector fields, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x). In that case, if F is a linear functional that depends only on f(x), then it&#x27;s equivalent to a covector at x. However, there are linear functionals on V that don&#x27;t come from covectors at a single point. For example, take F(f) = f(x) + f(y) for two distinct points x and y. Then F is R-linear, but depends on the values of f at two points. So even if f and g agree at x, if they differ at y, F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, such an F would not satisfy the condition. Therefore, in general, an R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily depend only on the value at a single point. 

However, if the linear map F is also C^∞(X)-linear, then by the tensor characterization lemma (sometimes called the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry), it is equivalent to a covector field, and thus F(f) depends only on f pointwise. But since the problem specifies only R-linearity, the answer is no.

Therefore, the conclusion is that an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R does not necessarily satisfy that F(f) depends only on f(x); it can depend on the behavior of f at other points. Hence, if f and g agree at x, F(f) and F(g) need not be equal. So the answer is no, it does not follow that F(f)(x) = F(g)(x).

But wait, hold on. If F is a map from V to R, then F(f) is a real number. The problem states &quot;the value of an R-linear map F: V → R at a point x&quot;. Maybe there is a misunderstanding here. Perhaps F is supposed to be a function on the manifold that is constructed from the vector field in an R-linear way. But if F is R-linear from V to R, then F(f) is just a real number, not a function on X. So evaluating it at x doesn&#x27;t make sense. Therefore, maybe the problem is misphrased. Alternatively, maybe F is a function that takes a vector field and a point and returns a real number, being linear in the vector field argument for each fixed point. In that case, the question would make sense: is F(-, x): V → R, which is linear, determined solely by the value of the vector field at x. In that interpretation, the answer would still be no, because as before, you can have F(f, x) depend on derivatives of f at x, hence not just f(x). 

Alternatively, if F is required to be a linear map from V to R for each point x, such that F_x(f) depends only on f(x), then each F_x would be a covector at x, and the assignment x ↦ F_x would be a differential 1-form. But the question is whether an arbitrary R-linear map F: V → R (for a fixed x?) has this property. 

But given the problem as stated, with possible ambiguities, the most reasonable interpretation is that F is an R-linear map from V to R, and the question is whether F(f) depends only on f(x), in the sense that if f and g agree at x, then F(f) = F(g). But since F maps into R, the real numbers, F(f) is a single real number. So if we fix x, and consider F as a linear functional on V, does F(f) depend only on f(x)? For example, take F(f) = integral over X of some function times f. Then clearly F(f) depends on f over the whole manifold. Alternatively, F(f) could be f(x_0) for a fixed x_0, which only depends on f at x_0. But in general, linear functionals on V can be a combination of evaluations at multiple points or integrals, etc. Therefore, unless F is specifically an evaluation functional at x, it can depend on more than just the value at x. Hence, the answer is no. 

To make it concrete, suppose X is the real line, V is the space of smooth vector fields (which can be identified with smooth functions on R). Let F: V → R be defined by F(f) = f(0) + f(1). This is R-linear. If f and g agree at x = 0, but differ at x = 1, then F(f) ≠ F(g). Therefore, even though f(0) = g(0), F(f) ≠ F(g). So in this case, F does not depend only on the value at a single point. Hence, the answer is no.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine whether an \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) at a point \( x \) depends only on the value of the vector field at that point, we need to analyze if \( f(x) = g(x) \) implies \( F(f)(x) = F(g)(x) \).

1. **Definitions and Context**:
   - A vector field on a manifold \( X \) assigns a tangent vector to each point \( x \in X \).
   - The space \( V \) of vector fields is a module over the ring of smooth functions \( C^\infty(X) \).
   - An \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) is a linear functional on the space of vector fields.

2. **Key Considerations**:
   - If \( F \) were \( C^\infty(X) \)-linear, it would correspond to a covector field, and \( F(f)(x) \) would depend only on \( f(x) \). However, \( F \) is only \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear.
   - \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear maps can depend on more than just the value at a single point. For example, they might involve integrals or evaluations at multiple points.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider \( X = \mathbb{R} \) and \( V \) as the space of smooth vector fields (identified with smooth functions).
   - Define \( F(f) = f(0) + f(1) \). This is \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear.
   - If \( f \) and \( g \) agree at \( x = 0 \) but differ at \( x = 1 \), then \( F(f) \neq F(g) \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - An arbitrary \( \mathbb{R} \)-linear map \( F: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \) does not necessarily depend only on the value of the vector field at a single point. It can depend on the vector field&#x27;s values at multiple points or other global properties.
