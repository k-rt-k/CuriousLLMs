Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this question: If I have two Hopf algebras, H and H&#x27;, and a bialgebra map φ between them, does φ automatically preserve the antipode? In other words, is φ necessarily a Hopf algebra map? Hmm, let&#x27;s think.

First, let me recall some definitions. A Hopf algebra is a bialgebra with an antipode map S satisfying certain properties. A bialgebra map is a linear map that is both an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism. So the question is whether such a map must also commute with the antipode.

I remember that in some cases, the antipode is unique if it exists. Maybe that uniqueness forces φ to preserve it. Let me check. Suppose φ: H → H&#x27; is a bialgebra map. Since H and H&#x27; are Hopf algebras, they have antipodes S and S&#x27; respectively. We need to see if φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ.

Let&#x27;s recall the defining property of the antipode. For any h in H, we have:

μ_H∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ_H(h) = η_H∘ε_H(h)

where μ_H is the multiplication, Δ_H is the comultiplication, η_H is the unit, and ε_H is the counit. Similarly, in H&#x27;:

μ_{H&#x27;}∘(id ⊗ S&#x27;)∘Δ_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;) = η_{H&#x27;}∘ε_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;)

for any h&#x27; in H&#x27;.

Since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves the multiplication, comultiplication, unit, and counit. So φ∘μ_H = μ_{H&#x27;}∘(φ ⊗ φ), Δ_{H&#x27;}∘φ = (φ ⊗ φ)∘Δ_H, φ∘η_H = η_{H&#x27;}, and ε_{H&#x27;}∘φ = ε_H.

Now, let&#x27;s try to compute φ(S(h)) and S&#x27;(φ(h)) and see if they are equal.

Start with φ applied to the antipode equation in H:

φ(μ_H(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_H(ε_H(h)))

Since φ is an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism, this becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(φ ⊗ φ)(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

But φ is a coalgebra map, so Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = (φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h). Therefore, substituting, the left side becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

On the right side, we have η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))) which is the same as applying the antipode equation in H&#x27; to φ(h):

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

Therefore, both sides are equal to η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))). So we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

Which implies that:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ (φ∘S - S&#x27;∘φ))Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = 0

Hmm. So if the Hopf algebra H&#x27; has the property that the map μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ f)Δ_{H&#x27;} is injective for any linear map f, then this would force φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a general property of Hopf algebras. Alternatively, maybe we can use the uniqueness of the antipode.

In a Hopf algebra, the antipode is the unique linear map S such that μ∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ = η∘ε. So if we have another map T such that μ∘(id ⊗ T)∘Δ = η∘ε, then T must equal S.

In our case, for the element φ(h) in H&#x27;, we have two maps: S&#x27; and φ∘S. Both need to satisfy the antipode equation. Let&#x27;s verify.

For S&#x27;, we already know that μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

For φ∘S, we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ⊗φ)Δ_H(h) = φ(μ_H(id⊗S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_Hε_H(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

So both φ∘S and S&#x27; satisfy the antipode equation for φ(h). Since the antipode is unique, they must coincide. Therefore, φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. Therefore, φ preserves the antipode. Therefore, φ is a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, that seems to work. So the key point is that the antipode is uniquely determined by the bialgebra structure, so if φ preserves the bialgebra structure, then it has to preserve the antipode. Therefore, yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

But wait, is there a case where the antipode is not unique? I thought in a Hopf algebra the antipode is unique. Let me check. Suppose there are two antipodes S and T. Then for any h, μ(id⊗S)Δ(h) = ηε(h) and μ(id⊗T)Δ(h) = ηε(h). So μ(id⊗(S - T))Δ(h) = 0. If the Hopf algebra is such that the map μ(id⊗f)Δ is injective for f = S - T, then S - T = 0, so S = T. But does this hold?

Alternatively, perhaps using the convolution algebra. The antipode is the inverse of the identity map in the convolution algebra. Since the convolution algebra is an algebra, inverses are unique. Therefore, the antipode is unique. Therefore, if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ∘S and S&#x27;∘φ both satisfy the antipode property, so they must be equal. Therefore, φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, a bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, but I remember that in some books, they define a Hopf algebra map as a bialgebra map that also preserves the antipode. So maybe the question is whether this is redundant. And according to this reasoning, yes, it is redundant. So the answer should be yes.

But let me see if I can find a counterexample. Suppose H and H&#x27; are Hopf algebras, and φ is a bialgebra map that does not preserve the antipode. Then, according to the above, this is impossible. But is there a concrete example?

Wait, take a commutative Hopf algebra, like the group algebra of an abelian group. Suppose φ is a bialgebra map. Then, since the group algebra is cocommutative, maybe the antipode is just the inverse in the group. If φ is a bialgebra map, it&#x27;s a group homomorphism, so it should preserve inverses. Therefore, φ(S(g)) = φ(g^{-1}) = φ(g)^{-1} = S&#x27;(φ(g)). So in this case, it works.

Another example: universal enveloping algebras. If φ: U(g) → U(g&#x27;) is a bialgebra map, then it&#x27;s induced by a Lie algebra map g → g&#x27;. The antipode in U(g) is given by S(x) = -x for x in g. So if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ(S(x)) = φ(-x) = -φ(x) = S&#x27;(φ(x)). So again, it preserves the antipode.

Hmm. Maybe in general, the antipode is a kind of &quot;inverse&quot; in the convolution algebra, and since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves convolution products. Therefore, if S is the inverse of id in H, then φ(S) should be the inverse of φ(id) = id in H&#x27;, which is S&#x27;. Therefore, φ(S) = S&#x27;.

Yes, this makes sense. In the convolution algebra Hom(H, H&#x27;), φ being a bialgebra map, we can consider the convolution product. The antipode S in H is the inverse of id_H in the convolution algebra Hom(H, H), and S&#x27; is the inverse of id_{H&#x27;} in Hom(H&#x27;, H&#x27;). Since φ is a bialgebra map, it is a morphism of convolution algebras. Therefore, φ sends inverses to inverses, so φ(S) = S&#x27; ∘ φ.

Therefore, this shows that φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given two Hopf algebras \( H \) and \( H&#x27; \), and a bialgebra map \( \phi: H \to H&#x27; \), we need to determine if \( \phi \) automatically preserves the antipode, making it a Hopf algebra map.

1. **Definitions and Properties**:
   - A Hopf algebra has an antipode \( S \) satisfying \( \mu \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta = \eta \circ \epsilon \).
   - A bialgebra map \( \phi \) preserves the algebra and coalgebra structures: 
     - \( \phi \circ \mu_H = \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (\phi \otimes \phi) \)
     - \( \Delta_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = (\phi \otimes \phi) \circ \Delta_H \)
     - \( \phi \circ \eta_H = \eta_{H&#x27;} \)
     - \( \epsilon_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = \epsilon_H \)

2. **Antipode Preservation**:
   - For \( h \in H \), the antipode property in \( H \) is \( \mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h) = \eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h) \).
   - Applying \( \phi \) to both sides, we get \( \phi(\mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h)) = \phi(\eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h)) \).
   - Using the bialgebra map properties, this becomes \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes \phi \circ S) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).

3. **Uniqueness of the Antipode**:
   - In \( H&#x27; \), the antipode \( S&#x27; \) satisfies \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes S&#x27;) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).
   - Both \( \phi \circ S \) and \( S&#x27; \circ \phi \) satisfy the same antipode equation in \( H&#x27; \).
   - Since the antipode in a Hopf algebra is unique, \( \phi \circ S = S&#x27; \circ \phi \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The uniqueness of the antipode and the properties of the bialgebra map ensure that \( \phi \) must preserve the antipode.
   - Therefore, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Let&#x27;s recall the defining property of the antipode. For any h in H, we have:

μ_H∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ_H(h) = η_H∘ε_H(h)

where μ_H is the multiplication, Δ_H is the comultiplication, η_H is the unit, and ε_H is the counit. Similarly, in H&#x27;:

μ_{H&#x27;}∘(id ⊗ S&#x27;)∘Δ_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;) = η_{H&#x27;}∘ε_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;)

for any h&#x27; in H&#x27;.

Since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves the multiplication, comultiplication, unit, and counit. So φ∘μ_H = μ_{H&#x27;}∘(φ ⊗ φ), Δ_{H&#x27;}∘φ = (φ ⊗ φ)∘Δ_H, φ∘η_H = η_{H&#x27;}, and ε_{H&#x27;}∘φ = ε_H.

Now, let&#x27;s try to compute φ(S(h)) and S&#x27;(φ(h)) and see if they are equal.

Start with φ applied to the antipode equation in H:

φ(μ_H(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_H(ε_H(h)))

Since φ is an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism, this becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(φ ⊗ φ)(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

But φ is a coalgebra map, so Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = (φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h). Therefore, substituting, the left side becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

On the right side, we have η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))) which is the same as applying the antipode equation in H&#x27; to φ(h):

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

Therefore, both sides are equal to η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))). So we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

Which implies that:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ (φ∘S - S&#x27;∘φ))Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = 0

Hmm. So if the Hopf algebra H&#x27; has the property that the map μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ f)Δ_{H&#x27;} is injective for any linear map f, then this would force φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a general property of Hopf algebras. Alternatively, maybe we can use the uniqueness of the antipode.

In a Hopf algebra, the antipode is the unique linear map S such that μ∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ = η∘ε. So if we have another map T such that μ∘(id ⊗ T)∘Δ = η∘ε, then T must equal S.

In our case, for the element φ(h) in H&#x27;, we have two maps: S&#x27; and φ∘S. Both need to satisfy the antipode equation. Let&#x27;s verify.

For S&#x27;, we already know that μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

For φ∘S, we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ⊗φ)Δ_H(h) = φ(μ_H(id⊗S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_Hε_H(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

So both φ∘S and S&#x27; satisfy the antipode equation for φ(h). Since the antipode is unique, they must coincide. Therefore, φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. Therefore, φ preserves the antipode. Therefore, φ is a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, that seems to work. So the key point is that the antipode is uniquely determined by the bialgebra structure, so if φ preserves the bialgebra structure, then it has to preserve the antipode. Therefore, yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Then for any h, μ(id⊗S)Δ(h) = ηε(h) and μ(id⊗T)Δ(h) = ηε(h). So μ(id⊗(S - T))Δ(h) = 0. If the Hopf algebra is such that the map μ(id⊗f)Δ is injective for f = S - T, then S - T = 0, so S = T. But does this hold?

Alternatively, perhaps using the convolution algebra. The antipode is the inverse of the identity map in the convolution algebra. Since the convolution algebra is an algebra, inverses are unique. Therefore, the antipode is unique. Therefore, if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ∘S and S&#x27;∘φ both satisfy the antipode property, so they must be equal. Therefore, φ must preserve the antipode.

The antipode in U(g) is given by S(x) = -x for x in g. So if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ(S(x)) = φ(-x) = -φ(x) = S&#x27;(φ(x)). So again, it preserves the antipode.

Since φ is a bialgebra map, it is a morphism of convolution algebras. Therefore, φ sends inverses to inverses, so φ(S) = S&#x27; ∘ φ.

Therefore, this shows that φ must preserve the antipode.

\boxed{Yes}

Given two Hopf algebras \( H \) and \( H&#x27; \), and a bialgebra map \( \phi: H \to H&#x27; \), we need to determine if \( \phi \) automatically preserves the antipode, making it a Hopf algebra map.

1. **Definitions and Properties**:
   - A Hopf algebra has an antipode \( S \) satisfying \( \mu \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta = \eta \circ \epsilon \).
   - A bialgebra map \( \phi \) preserves the algebra and coalgebra structures: 
     - \( \phi \circ \mu_H = \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (\phi \otimes \phi) \)
     - \( \Delta_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = (\phi \otimes \phi) \circ \Delta_H \)
     - \( \phi \circ \eta_H = \eta_{H&#x27;} \)
     - \( \epsilon_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = \epsilon_H \)

2. **Antipode Preservation**:
   - For \( h \in H \), the antipode property in \( H \) is \( \mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h) = \eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h) \).
   - Applying \( \phi \) to both sides, we get \( \phi(\mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h)) = \phi(\eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h)) \).
   - Using the bialgebra map properties, this becomes \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes \phi \circ S) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).

3. **Uniqueness of the Antipode**:
   - In \( H&#x27; \), the antipode \( S&#x27; \) satisfies \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes S&#x27;) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).
   - Both \( \phi \circ S \) and \( S&#x27; \circ \phi \) satisfy the same antipode equation in \( H&#x27; \).
   - Since the antipode in a Hopf algebra is unique, \( \phi \circ S = S&#x27; \circ \phi \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The uniqueness of the antipode and the properties of the bialgebra map ensure that \( \phi \) must preserve the antipode.
   - Therefore, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this question: If I have two Hopf algebras, H and H&#x27;, and a bialgebra map φ between them, does φ automatically preserve the antipode? In other words, is φ necessarily a Hopf algebra map? Hmm, let&#x27;s think.

First, let me recall some definitions. A Hopf algebra is a bialgebra with an antipode map S satisfying certain properties. A bialgebra map is a linear map that is both an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism. So the question is whether such a map must also commute with the antipode.

I remember that in some cases, the antipode is unique if it exists. Maybe that uniqueness forces φ to preserve it. Let me check. Suppose φ: H → H&#x27; is a bialgebra map. Since H and H&#x27; are Hopf algebras, they have antipodes S and S&#x27; respectively. We need to see if φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ.

Let&#x27;s recall the defining property of the antipode. For any h in H, we have:

μ_H∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ_H(h) = η_H∘ε_H(h)

where μ_H is the multiplication, Δ_H is the comultiplication, η_H is the unit, and ε_H is the counit. Similarly, in H&#x27;:

μ_{H&#x27;}∘(id ⊗ S&#x27;)∘Δ_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;) = η_{H&#x27;}∘ε_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;)

for any h&#x27; in H&#x27;.

Since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves the multiplication, comultiplication, unit, and counit. So φ∘μ_H = μ_{H&#x27;}∘(φ ⊗ φ), Δ_{H&#x27;}∘φ = (φ ⊗ φ)∘Δ_H, φ∘η_H = η_{H&#x27;}, and ε_{H&#x27;}∘φ = ε_H.

Now, let&#x27;s try to compute φ(S(h)) and S&#x27;(φ(h)) and see if they are equal.

Start with φ applied to the antipode equation in H:

φ(μ_H(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_H(ε_H(h)))

Since φ is an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism, this becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(φ ⊗ φ)(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

But φ is a coalgebra map, so Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = (φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h). Therefore, substituting, the left side becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

On the right side, we have η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))) which is the same as applying the antipode equation in H&#x27; to φ(h):

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

Therefore, both sides are equal to η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))). So we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

Which implies that:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ (φ∘S - S&#x27;∘φ))Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = 0

Hmm. So if the Hopf algebra H&#x27; has the property that the map μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ f)Δ_{H&#x27;} is injective for any linear map f, then this would force φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a general property of Hopf algebras. Alternatively, maybe we can use the uniqueness of the antipode.

In a Hopf algebra, the antipode is the unique linear map S such that μ∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ = η∘ε. So if we have another map T such that μ∘(id ⊗ T)∘Δ = η∘ε, then T must equal S.

In our case, for the element φ(h) in H&#x27;, we have two maps: S&#x27; and φ∘S. Both need to satisfy the antipode equation. Let&#x27;s verify.

For S&#x27;, we already know that μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

For φ∘S, we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ⊗φ)Δ_H(h) = φ(μ_H(id⊗S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_Hε_H(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

So both φ∘S and S&#x27; satisfy the antipode equation for φ(h). Since the antipode is unique, they must coincide. Therefore, φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. Therefore, φ preserves the antipode. Therefore, φ is a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, that seems to work. So the key point is that the antipode is uniquely determined by the bialgebra structure, so if φ preserves the bialgebra structure, then it has to preserve the antipode. Therefore, yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

But wait, is there a case where the antipode is not unique? I thought in a Hopf algebra the antipode is unique. Let me check. Suppose there are two antipodes S and T. Then for any h, μ(id⊗S)Δ(h) = ηε(h) and μ(id⊗T)Δ(h) = ηε(h). So μ(id⊗(S - T))Δ(h) = 0. If the Hopf algebra is such that the map μ(id⊗f)Δ is injective for f = S - T, then S - T = 0, so S = T. But does this hold?

Alternatively, perhaps using the convolution algebra. The antipode is the inverse of the identity map in the convolution algebra. Since the convolution algebra is an algebra, inverses are unique. Therefore, the antipode is unique. Therefore, if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ∘S and S&#x27;∘φ both satisfy the antipode property, so they must be equal. Therefore, φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, a bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, but I remember that in some books, they define a Hopf algebra map as a bialgebra map that also preserves the antipode. So maybe the question is whether this is redundant. And according to this reasoning, yes, it is redundant. So the answer should be yes.

But let me see if I can find a counterexample. Suppose H and H&#x27; are Hopf algebras, and φ is a bialgebra map that does not preserve the antipode. Then, according to the above, this is impossible. But is there a concrete example?

Wait, take a commutative Hopf algebra, like the group algebra of an abelian group. Suppose φ is a bialgebra map. Then, since the group algebra is cocommutative, maybe the antipode is just the inverse in the group. If φ is a bialgebra map, it&#x27;s a group homomorphism, so it should preserve inverses. Therefore, φ(S(g)) = φ(g^{-1}) = φ(g)^{-1} = S&#x27;(φ(g)). So in this case, it works.

Another example: universal enveloping algebras. If φ: U(g) → U(g&#x27;) is a bialgebra map, then it&#x27;s induced by a Lie algebra map g → g&#x27;. The antipode in U(g) is given by S(x) = -x for x in g. So if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ(S(x)) = φ(-x) = -φ(x) = S&#x27;(φ(x)). So again, it preserves the antipode.

Hmm. Maybe in general, the antipode is a kind of &quot;inverse&quot; in the convolution algebra, and since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves convolution products. Therefore, if S is the inverse of id in H, then φ(S) should be the inverse of φ(id) = id in H&#x27;, which is S&#x27;. Therefore, φ(S) = S&#x27;.

Yes, this makes sense. In the convolution algebra Hom(H, H&#x27;), φ being a bialgebra map, we can consider the convolution product. The antipode S in H is the inverse of id_H in the convolution algebra Hom(H, H), and S&#x27; is the inverse of id_{H&#x27;} in Hom(H&#x27;, H&#x27;). Since φ is a bialgebra map, it is a morphism of convolution algebras. Therefore, φ sends inverses to inverses, so φ(S) = S&#x27; ∘ φ.

Therefore, this shows that φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given two Hopf algebras \( H \) and \( H&#x27; \), and a bialgebra map \( \phi: H \to H&#x27; \), we need to determine if \( \phi \) automatically preserves the antipode, making it a Hopf algebra map.

1. **Definitions and Properties**:
   - A Hopf algebra has an antipode \( S \) satisfying \( \mu \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta = \eta \circ \epsilon \).
   - A bialgebra map \( \phi \) preserves the algebra and coalgebra structures: 
     - \( \phi \circ \mu_H = \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (\phi \otimes \phi) \)
     - \( \Delta_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = (\phi \otimes \phi) \circ \Delta_H \)
     - \( \phi \circ \eta_H = \eta_{H&#x27;} \)
     - \( \epsilon_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = \epsilon_H \)

2. **Antipode Preservation**:
   - For \( h \in H \), the antipode property in \( H \) is \( \mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h) = \eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h) \).
   - Applying \( \phi \) to both sides, we get \( \phi(\mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h)) = \phi(\eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h)) \).
   - Using the bialgebra map properties, this becomes \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes \phi \circ S) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).

3. **Uniqueness of the Antipode**:
   - In \( H&#x27; \), the antipode \( S&#x27; \) satisfies \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes S&#x27;) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).
   - Both \( \phi \circ S \) and \( S&#x27; \circ \phi \) satisfy the same antipode equation in \( H&#x27; \).
   - Since the antipode in a Hopf algebra is unique, \( \phi \circ S = S&#x27; \circ \phi \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The uniqueness of the antipode and the properties of the bialgebra map ensure that \( \phi \) must preserve the antipode.
   - Therefore, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Let&#x27;s recall the defining property of the antipode. For any h in H, we have:

μ_H∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ_H(h) = η_H∘ε_H(h)

where μ_H is the multiplication, Δ_H is the comultiplication, η_H is the unit, and ε_H is the counit. Similarly, in H&#x27;:

μ_{H&#x27;}∘(id ⊗ S&#x27;)∘Δ_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;) = η_{H&#x27;}∘ε_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;)

for any h&#x27; in H&#x27;.

Since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves the multiplication, comultiplication, unit, and counit. So φ∘μ_H = μ_{H&#x27;}∘(φ ⊗ φ), Δ_{H&#x27;}∘φ = (φ ⊗ φ)∘Δ_H, φ∘η_H = η_{H&#x27;}, and ε_{H&#x27;}∘φ = ε_H.

Now, let&#x27;s try to compute φ(S(h)) and S&#x27;(φ(h)) and see if they are equal.

Start with φ applied to the antipode equation in H:

φ(μ_H(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_H(ε_H(h)))

Since φ is an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism, this becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(φ ⊗ φ)(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

But φ is a coalgebra map, so Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = (φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h). Therefore, substituting, the left side becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

On the right side, we have η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))) which is the same as applying the antipode equation in H&#x27; to φ(h):

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

Therefore, both sides are equal to η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))). So we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

Which implies that:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ (φ∘S - S&#x27;∘φ))Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = 0

Hmm. So if the Hopf algebra H&#x27; has the property that the map μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ f)Δ_{H&#x27;} is injective for any linear map f, then this would force φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a general property of Hopf algebras. Alternatively, maybe we can use the uniqueness of the antipode.

In a Hopf algebra, the antipode is the unique linear map S such that μ∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ = η∘ε. So if we have another map T such that μ∘(id ⊗ T)∘Δ = η∘ε, then T must equal S.

In our case, for the element φ(h) in H&#x27;, we have two maps: S&#x27; and φ∘S. Both need to satisfy the antipode equation. Let&#x27;s verify.

For S&#x27;, we already know that μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

For φ∘S, we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ⊗φ)Δ_H(h) = φ(μ_H(id⊗S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_Hε_H(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

So both φ∘S and S&#x27; satisfy the antipode equation for φ(h). Since the antipode is unique, they must coincide. Therefore, φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. Therefore, φ preserves the antipode. Therefore, φ is a Hopf algebra map.

Then for any h, μ(id⊗S)Δ(h) = ηε(h) and μ(id⊗T)Δ(h) = ηε(h). So μ(id⊗(S - T))Δ(h) = 0. If the Hopf algebra is such that the map μ(id⊗f)Δ is injective for f = S - T, then S - T = 0, so S = T. But does this hold?

Alternatively, perhaps using the convolution algebra. The antipode is the inverse of the identity map in the convolution algebra. Since the convolution algebra is an algebra, inverses are unique.

Therefore, this shows that φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given two Hopf algebras \( H \) and \( H&#x27; \), and a bialgebra map \( \phi: H \to H&#x27; \), we need to determine if \( \phi \) automatically preserves the antipode, making it a Hopf algebra map.

1. **Definitions and Properties**:
   - A Hopf algebra has an antipode \( S \) satisfying \( \mu \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta = \eta \circ \epsilon \).
   - A bialgebra map \( \phi \) preserves the algebra and coalgebra structures: 
     - \( \phi \circ \mu_H = \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (\phi \otimes \phi) \)
     - \( \Delta_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = (\phi \otimes \phi) \circ \Delta_H \)
     - \( \phi \circ \eta_H = \eta_{H&#x27;} \)
     - \( \epsilon_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = \epsilon_H \)

2. **Antipode Preservation**:
   - For \( h \in H \), the antipode property in \( H \) is \( \mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h) = \eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h) \).
   - Applying \( \phi \) to both sides, we get \( \phi(\mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h)) = \phi(\eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h)) \).
   - Using the bialgebra map properties, this becomes \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes \phi \circ S) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).

3. **Uniqueness of the Antipode**:
   - In \( H&#x27; \), the antipode \( S&#x27; \) satisfies \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes S&#x27;) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).
   - Both \( \phi \circ S \) and \( S&#x27; \circ \phi \) satisfy the same antipode equation in \( H&#x27; \).
   - Since the antipode in a Hopf algebra is unique, \( \phi \circ S = S&#x27; \circ \phi \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The uniqueness of the antipode and the properties of the bialgebra map ensure that \( \phi \) must preserve the antipode.
   - Therefore, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

I remember that in some cases, the antipode is unique if it exists. Maybe that uniqueness forces φ to preserve it. Let me check. Suppose φ: H → H&#x27; is a bialgebra map. Since H and H&#x27; are Hopf algebras, they have antipodes S and S&#x27; respectively. We need to see if φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ.

Let&#x27;s recall the defining property of the antipode. For any h in H, we have:

μ_H∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ_H(h) = η_H∘ε_H(h)

where μ_H is the multiplication, Δ_H is the comultiplication, η_H is the unit, and ε_H is the counit. Similarly, in H&#x27;:

μ_{H&#x27;}∘(id ⊗ S&#x27;)∘Δ_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;) = η_{H&#x27;}∘ε_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;)

for any h&#x27; in H&#x27;.

Since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves the multiplication, comultiplication, unit, and counit. So φ∘μ_H = μ_{H&#x27;}∘(φ ⊗ φ), Δ_{H&#x27;}∘φ = (φ ⊗ φ)∘Δ_H, φ∘η_H = η_{H&#x27;}, and ε_{H&#x27;}∘φ = ε_H.

Now, let&#x27;s try to compute φ(S(h)) and S&#x27;(φ(h)) and see if they are equal.

Start with φ applied to the antipode equation in H:

φ(μ_H(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_H(ε_H(h)))

Since φ is an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism, this becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(φ ⊗ φ)(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

But φ is a coalgebra map, so Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = (φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h). Therefore, substituting, the left side becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

On the right side, we have η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))) which is the same as applying the antipode equation in H&#x27; to φ(h):

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

Therefore, both sides are equal to η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))). So we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

Which implies that:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ (φ∘S - S&#x27;∘φ))Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = 0

Hmm. So if the Hopf algebra H&#x27; has the property that the map μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ f)Δ_{H&#x27;} is injective for any linear map f, then this would force φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a general property of Hopf algebras. Alternatively, maybe we can use the uniqueness of the antipode.

In a Hopf algebra, the antipode is the unique linear map S such that μ∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ = η∘ε. So if we have another map T such that μ∘(id ⊗ T)∘Δ = η∘ε, then T must equal S.

In our case, for the element φ(h) in H&#x27;, we have two maps: S&#x27; and φ∘S. Both need to satisfy the antipode equation. Let&#x27;s verify.

For S&#x27;, we already know that μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

For φ∘S, we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ⊗φ)Δ_H(h) = φ(μ_H(id⊗S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_Hε_H(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

So both φ∘S and S&#x27; satisfy the antipode equation for φ(h). Since the antipode is unique, they must coincide. Therefore, φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. Therefore, φ preserves the antipode. Therefore, φ is a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, that seems to work. So the key point is that the antipode is uniquely determined by the bialgebra structure, so if φ preserves the bialgebra structure, then it has to preserve the antipode. Therefore, yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

But wait, is there a case where the antipode is not unique? I thought in a Hopf algebra the antipode is unique. Let me check. Suppose there are two antipodes S and T. Then for any h, μ(id⊗S)Δ(h) = ηε(h) and μ(id⊗T)Δ(h) = ηε(h). So μ(id⊗(S - T))Δ(h) = 0. If the Hopf algebra is such that the map μ(id⊗f)Δ is injective for f = S - T, then S - T = 0, so S = T. But does this hold?

Alternatively, perhaps using the convolution algebra. The antipode is the inverse of the identity map in the convolution algebra. Since the convolution algebra is an algebra, inverses are unique. Therefore, the antipode is unique. Therefore, if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ∘S and S&#x27;∘φ both satisfy the antipode property, so they must be equal. Therefore, φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, a bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, but I remember that in some books, they define a Hopf algebra map as a bialgebra map that also preserves the antipode. So maybe the question is whether this is redundant. And according to this reasoning, yes, it is redundant. So the answer should be yes.

But let me see if I can find a counterexample. Suppose H and H&#x27; are Hopf algebras, and φ is a bialgebra map that does not preserve the antipode. Then, according to the above, this is impossible. But is there a concrete example?

Wait, take a commutative Hopf algebra, like the group algebra of an abelian group. Suppose φ is a bialgebra map. Then, since the group algebra is cocommutative, maybe the antipode is just the inverse in the group. If φ is a bialgebra map, it&#x27;s a group homomorphism, so it should preserve inverses. Therefore, φ(S(g)) = φ(g^{-1}) = φ(g)^{-1} = S&#x27;(φ(g)). So in this case, it works.

Another example: universal enveloping algebras. If φ: U(g) → U(g&#x27;) is a bialgebra map, then it&#x27;s induced by a Lie algebra map g → g&#x27;. The antipode in U(g) is given by S(x) = -x for x in g. So if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ(S(x)) = φ(-x) = -φ(x) = S&#x27;(φ(x)). So again, it preserves the antipode.

Hmm. Maybe in general, the antipode is a kind of &quot;inverse&quot; in the convolution algebra, and since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves convolution products. Therefore, if S is the inverse of id in H, then φ(S) should be the inverse of φ(id) = id in H&#x27;, which is S&#x27;. Therefore, φ(S) = S&#x27;.

Yes, this makes sense. In the convolution algebra Hom(H, H&#x27;), φ being a bialgebra map, we can consider the convolution product. The antipode S in H is the inverse of id_H in the convolution algebra Hom(H, H), and S&#x27; is the inverse of id_{H&#x27;} in Hom(H&#x27;, H&#x27;). Since φ is a bialgebra map, it is a morphism of convolution algebras. Therefore, φ sends inverses to inverses, so φ(S) = S&#x27; ∘ φ.

Therefore, this shows that φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given two Hopf algebras \( H \) and \( H&#x27; \), and a bialgebra map \( \phi: H \to H&#x27; \), we need to determine if \( \phi \) automatically preserves the antipode, making it a Hopf algebra map.

1. **Definitions and Properties**:
   - A Hopf algebra has an antipode \( S \) satisfying \( \mu \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta = \eta \circ \epsilon \).
   - A bialgebra map \( \phi \) preserves the algebra and coalgebra structures: 
     - \( \phi \circ \mu_H = \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (\phi \otimes \phi) \)
     - \( \Delta_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = (\phi \otimes \phi) \circ \Delta_H \)
     - \( \phi \circ \eta_H = \eta_{H&#x27;} \)
     - \( \epsilon_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = \epsilon_H \)

2. **Antipode Preservation**:
   - For \( h \in H \), the antipode property in \( H \) is \( \mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h) = \eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h) \).
   - Applying \( \phi \) to both sides, we get \( \phi(\mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h)) = \phi(\eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h)) \).
   - Using the bialgebra map properties, this becomes \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes \phi \circ S) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).

3. **Uniqueness of the Antipode**:
   - In \( H&#x27; \), the antipode \( S&#x27; \) satisfies \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes S&#x27;) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).
   - Both \( \phi \circ S \) and \( S&#x27; \circ \phi \) satisfy the same antipode equation in \( H&#x27; \).
   - Since the antipode in a Hopf algebra is unique, \( \phi \circ S = S&#x27; \circ \phi \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The uniqueness of the antipode and the properties of the bialgebra map ensure that \( \phi \) must preserve the antipode.
   - Therefore, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Let&#x27;s recall the defining property of the antipode. For any h in H, we have:

μ_H∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ_H(h) = η_H∘ε_H(h)

where μ_H is the multiplication, Δ_H is the comultiplication, η_H is the unit, and ε_H is the counit. Similarly, in H&#x27;:

μ_{H&#x27;}∘(id ⊗ S&#x27;)∘Δ_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;) = η_{H&#x27;}∘ε_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;)

for any h&#x27; in H&#x27;.

Since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves the multiplication, comultiplication, unit, and counit. So φ∘μ_H = μ_{H&#x27;}∘(φ ⊗ φ), Δ_{H&#x27;}∘φ = (φ ⊗ φ)∘Δ_H, φ∘η_H = η_{H&#x27;}, and ε_{H&#x27;}∘φ = ε_H.

Now, let&#x27;s try to compute φ(S(h)) and S&#x27;(φ(h)) and see if they are equal.

Start with φ applied to the antipode equation in H:

φ(μ_H(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_H(ε_H(h)))

Since φ is an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism, this becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(φ ⊗ φ)(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

But φ is a coalgebra map, so Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = (φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h). Therefore, substituting, the left side becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

On the right side, we have η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))) which is the same as applying the antipode equation in H&#x27; to φ(h):

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

Therefore, both sides are equal to η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))). So we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

Which implies that:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ (φ∘S - S&#x27;∘φ))Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = 0

Hmm. So if the Hopf algebra H&#x27; has the property that the map μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ f)Δ_{H&#x27;} is injective for any linear map f, then this would force φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a general property of Hopf algebras. Alternatively, maybe we can use the uniqueness of the antipode.

In a Hopf algebra, the antipode is the unique linear map S such that μ∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ = η∘ε. So if we have another map T such that μ∘(id ⊗ T)∘Δ = η∘ε, then T must equal S.

In our case, for the element φ(h) in H&#x27;, we have two maps: S&#x27; and φ∘S. Both need to satisfy the antipode equation. Let&#x27;s verify.

For S&#x27;, we already know that μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

For φ∘S, we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ⊗φ)Δ_H(h) = φ(μ_H(id⊗S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_Hε_H(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

So both φ∘S and S&#x27; satisfy the antipode equation for φ(h). Since the antipode is unique, they must coincide. Therefore, φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. Therefore, φ preserves the antipode. Therefore, φ is a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, that seems to work. So the key point is that the antipode is uniquely determined by the bialgebra structure, so if φ preserves the bialgebra structure, then it has to preserve the antipode. Therefore, yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

But does this hold?

Alternatively, perhaps using the convolution algebra. The antipode is the inverse of the identity map in the convolution algebra. Since the convolution algebra is an algebra, inverses are unique.

\boxed{Yes}

Given two Hopf algebras \( H \) and \( H&#x27; \), and a bialgebra map \( \phi: H \to H&#x27; \), we need to determine if \( \phi \) automatically preserves the antipode, making it a Hopf algebra map.

1. **Definitions and Properties**:
   - A Hopf algebra has an antipode \( S \) satisfying \( \mu \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta = \eta \circ \epsilon \).
   - A bialgebra map \( \phi \) preserves the algebra and coalgebra structures: 
     - \( \phi \circ \mu_H = \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (\phi \otimes \phi) \)
     - \( \Delta_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = (\phi \otimes \phi) \circ \Delta_H \)
     - \( \phi \circ \eta_H = \eta_{H&#x27;} \)
     - \( \epsilon_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = \epsilon_H \)

2. **Antipode Preservation**:
   - For \( h \in H \), the antipode property in \( H \) is \( \mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h) = \eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h) \).
   - Applying \( \phi \) to both sides, we get \( \phi(\mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h)) = \phi(\eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h)) \).
   - Using the bialgebra map properties, this becomes \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes \phi \circ S) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).

3. **Uniqueness of the Antipode**:
   - In \( H&#x27; \), the antipode \( S&#x27; \) satisfies \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes S&#x27;) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).
   - Both \( \phi \circ S \) and \( S&#x27; \circ \phi \) satisfy the same antipode equation in \( H&#x27; \).
   - Since the antipode in a Hopf algebra is unique, \( \phi \circ S = S&#x27; \circ \phi \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The uniqueness of the antipode and the properties of the bialgebra map ensure that \( \phi \) must preserve the antipode.
   - Therefore, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

First, let me recall some definitions. A Hopf algebra is a bialgebra with an antipode map S satisfying certain properties. A bialgebra map is a linear map that is both an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism. So the question is whether such a map must also commute with the antipode.

I remember that in some cases, the antipode is unique if it exists. Maybe that uniqueness forces φ to preserve it. Let me check. Suppose φ: H → H&#x27; is a bialgebra map. Since H and H&#x27; are Hopf algebras, they have antipodes S and S&#x27; respectively. We need to see if φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ.

Let&#x27;s recall the defining property of the antipode. For any h in H, we have:

μ_H∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ_H(h) = η_H∘ε_H(h)

where μ_H is the multiplication, Δ_H is the comultiplication, η_H is the unit, and ε_H is the counit. Similarly, in H&#x27;:

μ_{H&#x27;}∘(id ⊗ S&#x27;)∘Δ_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;) = η_{H&#x27;}∘ε_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;)

for any h&#x27; in H&#x27;.

Since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves the multiplication, comultiplication, unit, and counit. So φ∘μ_H = μ_{H&#x27;}∘(φ ⊗ φ), Δ_{H&#x27;}∘φ = (φ ⊗ φ)∘Δ_H, φ∘η_H = η_{H&#x27;}, and ε_{H&#x27;}∘φ = ε_H.

Now, let&#x27;s try to compute φ(S(h)) and S&#x27;(φ(h)) and see if they are equal.

Start with φ applied to the antipode equation in H:

φ(μ_H(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_H(ε_H(h)))

Since φ is an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism, this becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(φ ⊗ φ)(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

But φ is a coalgebra map, so Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = (φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h). Therefore, substituting, the left side becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

On the right side, we have η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))) which is the same as applying the antipode equation in H&#x27; to φ(h):

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

Therefore, both sides are equal to η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))). So we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

Which implies that:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ (φ∘S - S&#x27;∘φ))Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = 0

Hmm. So if the Hopf algebra H&#x27; has the property that the map μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ f)Δ_{H&#x27;} is injective for any linear map f, then this would force φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a general property of Hopf algebras. Alternatively, maybe we can use the uniqueness of the antipode.

In a Hopf algebra, the antipode is the unique linear map S such that μ∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ = η∘ε. So if we have another map T such that μ∘(id ⊗ T)∘Δ = η∘ε, then T must equal S.

In our case, for the element φ(h) in H&#x27;, we have two maps: S&#x27; and φ∘S. Both need to satisfy the antipode equation. Let&#x27;s verify.

For S&#x27;, we already know that μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

For φ∘S, we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ⊗φ)Δ_H(h) = φ(μ_H(id⊗S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_Hε_H(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

So both φ∘S and S&#x27; satisfy the antipode equation for φ(h). Since the antipode is unique, they must coincide. Therefore, φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. Therefore, φ preserves the antipode. Therefore, φ is a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, that seems to work. So the key point is that the antipode is uniquely determined by the bialgebra structure, so if φ preserves the bialgebra structure, then it has to preserve the antipode. Therefore, yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

But wait, is there a case where the antipode is not unique? I thought in a Hopf algebra the antipode is unique. Let me check. Suppose there are two antipodes S and T. Then for any h, μ(id⊗S)Δ(h) = ηε(h) and μ(id⊗T)Δ(h) = ηε(h). So μ(id⊗(S - T))Δ(h) = 0. If the Hopf algebra is such that the map μ(id⊗f)Δ is injective for f = S - T, then S - T = 0, so S = T. But does this hold?

Alternatively, perhaps using the convolution algebra. The antipode is the inverse of the identity map in the convolution algebra. Since the convolution algebra is an algebra, inverses are unique. Therefore, the antipode is unique. Therefore, if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ∘S and S&#x27;∘φ both satisfy the antipode property, so they must be equal. Therefore, φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, a bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, but I remember that in some books, they define a Hopf algebra map as a bialgebra map that also preserves the antipode. So maybe the question is whether this is redundant. And according to this reasoning, yes, it is redundant. So the answer should be yes.

But let me see if I can find a counterexample. Suppose H and H&#x27; are Hopf algebras, and φ is a bialgebra map that does not preserve the antipode. Then, according to the above, this is impossible. But is there a concrete example?

Wait, take a commutative Hopf algebra, like the group algebra of an abelian group. Suppose φ is a bialgebra map. Then, since the group algebra is cocommutative, maybe the antipode is just the inverse in the group. If φ is a bialgebra map, it&#x27;s a group homomorphism, so it should preserve inverses. Therefore, φ(S(g)) = φ(g^{-1}) = φ(g)^{-1} = S&#x27;(φ(g)). So in this case, it works.

Another example: universal enveloping algebras. If φ: U(g) → U(g&#x27;) is a bialgebra map, then it&#x27;s induced by a Lie algebra map g → g&#x27;. The antipode in U(g) is given by S(x) = -x for x in g. So if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ(S(x)) = φ(-x) = -φ(x) = S&#x27;(φ(x)). So again, it preserves the antipode.

Hmm. Maybe in general, the antipode is a kind of &quot;inverse&quot; in the convolution algebra, and since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves convolution products. Therefore, if S is the inverse of id in H, then φ(S) should be the inverse of φ(id) = id in H&#x27;, which is S&#x27;. Therefore, φ(S) = S&#x27;.

Yes, this makes sense. In the convolution algebra Hom(H, H&#x27;), φ being a bialgebra map, we can consider the convolution product. The antipode S in H is the inverse of id_H in the convolution algebra Hom(H, H), and S&#x27; is the inverse of id_{H&#x27;} in Hom(H&#x27;, H&#x27;). Since φ is a bialgebra map, it is a morphism of convolution algebras. Therefore, φ sends inverses to inverses, so φ(S) = S&#x27; ∘ φ.

Therefore, this shows that φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given two Hopf algebras \( H \) and \( H&#x27; \), and a bialgebra map \( \phi: H \to H&#x27; \), we need to determine if \( \phi \) automatically preserves the antipode, making it a Hopf algebra map.

1. **Definitions and Properties**:
   - A Hopf algebra has an antipode \( S \) satisfying \( \mu \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta = \eta \circ \epsilon \).
   - A bialgebra map \( \phi \) preserves the algebra and coalgebra structures: 
     - \( \phi \circ \mu_H = \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (\phi \otimes \phi) \)
     - \( \Delta_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = (\phi \otimes \phi) \circ \Delta_H \)
     - \( \phi \circ \eta_H = \eta_{H&#x27;} \)
     - \( \epsilon_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = \epsilon_H \)

2. **Antipode Preservation**:
   - For \( h \in H \), the antipode property in \( H \) is \( \mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h) = \eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h) \).
   - Applying \( \phi \) to both sides, we get \( \phi(\mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h)) = \phi(\eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h)) \).
   - Using the bialgebra map properties, this becomes \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes \phi \circ S) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).

3. **Uniqueness of the Antipode**:
   - In \( H&#x27; \), the antipode \( S&#x27; \) satisfies \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes S&#x27;) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).
   - Both \( \phi \circ S \) and \( S&#x27; \circ \phi \) satisfy the same antipode equation in \( H&#x27; \).
   - Since the antipode in a Hopf algebra is unique, \( \phi \circ S = S&#x27; \circ \phi \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The uniqueness of the antipode and the properties of the bialgebra map ensure that \( \phi \) must preserve the antipode.
   - Therefore, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this question: If I have two Hopf algebras, H and H&#x27;, and a bialgebra map φ between them, does φ automatically preserve the antipode? In other words, is φ necessarily a Hopf algebra map? Hmm, let&#x27;s think.

First, let me recall some definitions. A Hopf algebra is a bialgebra with an antipode map S satisfying certain properties. A bialgebra map is a linear map that is both an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism. So the question is whether such a map must also commute with the antipode.

I remember that in some cases, the antipode is unique if it exists. Maybe that uniqueness forces φ to preserve it. Let me check. Suppose φ: H → H&#x27; is a bialgebra map. Since H and H&#x27; are Hopf algebras, they have antipodes S and S&#x27; respectively. We need to see if φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ.

Let&#x27;s recall the defining property of the antipode. For any h in H, we have:

μ_H∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ_H(h) = η_H∘ε_H(h)

where μ_H is the multiplication, Δ_H is the comultiplication, η_H is the unit, and ε_H is the counit. Similarly, in H&#x27;:

μ_{H&#x27;}∘(id ⊗ S&#x27;)∘Δ_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;) = η_{H&#x27;}∘ε_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;)

for any h&#x27; in H&#x27;.

Since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves the multiplication, comultiplication, unit, and counit. So φ∘μ_H = μ_{H&#x27;}∘(φ ⊗ φ), Δ_{H&#x27;}∘φ = (φ ⊗ φ)∘Δ_H, φ∘η_H = η_{H&#x27;}, and ε_{H&#x27;}∘φ = ε_H.

Now, let&#x27;s try to compute φ(S(h)) and S&#x27;(φ(h)) and see if they are equal.

Start with φ applied to the antipode equation in H:

φ(μ_H(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_H(ε_H(h)))

Since φ is an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism, this becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(φ ⊗ φ)(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

But φ is a coalgebra map, so Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = (φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h). Therefore, substituting, the left side becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

On the right side, we have η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))) which is the same as applying the antipode equation in H&#x27; to φ(h):

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

Therefore, both sides are equal to η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))). So we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

Which implies that:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ (φ∘S - S&#x27;∘φ))Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = 0

Hmm. So if the Hopf algebra H&#x27; has the property that the map μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ f)Δ_{H&#x27;} is injective for any linear map f, then this would force φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a general property of Hopf algebras. Alternatively, maybe we can use the uniqueness of the antipode.

In a Hopf algebra, the antipode is the unique linear map S such that μ∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ = η∘ε. So if we have another map T such that μ∘(id ⊗ T)∘Δ = η∘ε, then T must equal S.

In our case, for the element φ(h) in H&#x27;, we have two maps: S&#x27; and φ∘S. Both need to satisfy the antipode equation. Let&#x27;s verify.

For S&#x27;, we already know that μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

For φ∘S, we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ⊗φ)Δ_H(h) = φ(μ_H(id⊗S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_Hε_H(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

So both φ∘S and S&#x27; satisfy the antipode equation for φ(h). Since the antipode is unique, they must coincide. Therefore, φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. Therefore, φ preserves the antipode. Therefore, φ is a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, that seems to work. So the key point is that the antipode is uniquely determined by the bialgebra structure, so if φ preserves the bialgebra structure, then it has to preserve the antipode. Therefore, yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

But wait, is there a case where the antipode is not unique? I thought in a Hopf algebra the antipode is unique. Let me check. Suppose there are two antipodes S and T. Then for any h, μ(id⊗S)Δ(h) = ηε(h) and μ(id⊗T)Δ(h) = ηε(h). So μ(id⊗(S - T))Δ(h) = 0. If the Hopf algebra is such that the map μ(id⊗f)Δ is injective for f = S - T, then S - T = 0, so S = T. But does this hold?

Alternatively, perhaps using the convolution algebra. The antipode is the inverse of the identity map in the convolution algebra. Since the convolution algebra is an algebra, inverses are unique. Therefore, the antipode is unique. Therefore, if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ∘S and S&#x27;∘φ both satisfy the antipode property, so they must be equal. Therefore, φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, a bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Then, since the group algebra is cocommutative, maybe the antipode is just the inverse in the group. If φ is a bialgebra map, it&#x27;s a group homomorphism, so it should preserve inverses. Therefore, φ(S(g)) = φ(g^{-1}) = φ(g)^{-1} = S&#x27;(φ(g)). So in this case, it works.

Another example: universal enveloping algebras. If φ: U(g) → U(g&#x27;) is a bialgebra map, then it&#x27;s induced by a Lie algebra map g → g&#x27;. The antipode in U(g) is given by S(x) = -x for x in g. So if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ(S(x)) = φ(-x) = -φ(x) = S&#x27;(φ(x)). So again, it preserves the antipode.

Hmm. Maybe in general, the antipode is a kind of &quot;inverse&quot; in the convolution algebra, and since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves convolution products. Therefore, if S is the inverse of id in H, then φ(S) should be the inverse of φ(id) = id in H&#x27;, which is S&#x27;. Therefore, φ(S) = S&#x27;.

Yes, this makes sense. In the convolution algebra Hom(H, H&#x27;), φ being a bialgebra map, we can consider the convolution product. The antipode S in H is the inverse of id_H in the convolution algebra Hom(H, H), and S&#x27; is the inverse of id_{H&#x27;} in Hom(H&#x27;, H&#x27;). Since φ is a bialgebra map, it is a morphism of convolution algebras. Therefore, φ sends inverses to inverses, so φ(S) = S&#x27; ∘ φ.

Therefore, this shows that φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

\boxed{Yes}

Given two Hopf algebras \( H \) and \( H&#x27; \), and a bialgebra map \( \phi: H \to H&#x27; \), we need to determine if \( \phi \) automatically preserves the antipode, making it a Hopf algebra map.

1. **Definitions and Properties**:
   - A Hopf algebra has an antipode \( S \) satisfying \( \mu \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta = \eta \circ \epsilon \).
   - A bialgebra map \( \phi \) preserves the algebra and coalgebra structures: 
     - \( \phi \circ \mu_H = \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (\phi \otimes \phi) \)
     - \( \Delta_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = (\phi \otimes \phi) \circ \Delta_H \)
     - \( \phi \circ \eta_H = \eta_{H&#x27;} \)
     - \( \epsilon_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = \epsilon_H \)

2. **Antipode Preservation**:
   - For \( h \in H \), the antipode property in \( H \) is \( \mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h) = \eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h) \).
   - Applying \( \phi \) to both sides, we get \( \phi(\mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h)) = \phi(\eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h)) \).
   - Using the bialgebra map properties, this becomes \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes \phi \circ S) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).

3. **Uniqueness of the Antipode**:
   - In \( H&#x27; \), the antipode \( S&#x27; \) satisfies \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes S&#x27;) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).
   - Both \( \phi \circ S \) and \( S&#x27; \circ \phi \) satisfy the same antipode equation in \( H&#x27; \).
   - Since the antipode in a Hopf algebra is unique, \( \phi \circ S = S&#x27; \circ \phi \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The uniqueness of the antipode and the properties of the bialgebra map ensure that \( \phi \) must preserve the antipode.
   - Therefore, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Let&#x27;s recall the defining property of the antipode. For any h in H, we have:

μ_H∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ_H(h) = η_H∘ε_H(h)

where μ_H is the multiplication, Δ_H is the comultiplication, η_H is the unit, and ε_H is the counit. Similarly, in H&#x27;:

μ_{H&#x27;}∘(id ⊗ S&#x27;)∘Δ_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;) = η_{H&#x27;}∘ε_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;)

for any h&#x27; in H&#x27;.

Since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves the multiplication, comultiplication, unit, and counit. So φ∘μ_H = μ_{H&#x27;}∘(φ ⊗ φ), Δ_{H&#x27;}∘φ = (φ ⊗ φ)∘Δ_H, φ∘η_H = η_{H&#x27;}, and ε_{H&#x27;}∘φ = ε_H.

Now, let&#x27;s try to compute φ(S(h)) and S&#x27;(φ(h)) and see if they are equal.

Start with φ applied to the antipode equation in H:

φ(μ_H(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_H(ε_H(h)))

Since φ is an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism, this becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(φ ⊗ φ)(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

But φ is a coalgebra map, so Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = (φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h). Therefore, substituting, the left side becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

On the right side, we have η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))) which is the same as applying the antipode equation in H&#x27; to φ(h):

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

Therefore, both sides are equal to η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))). So we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

Which implies that:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ (φ∘S - S&#x27;∘φ))Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = 0

Hmm. So if the Hopf algebra H&#x27; has the property that the map μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ f)Δ_{H&#x27;} is injective for any linear map f, then this would force φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a general property of Hopf algebras. Alternatively, maybe we can use the uniqueness of the antipode.

In a Hopf algebra, the antipode is the unique linear map S such that μ∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ = η∘ε. So if we have another map T such that μ∘(id ⊗ T)∘Δ = η∘ε, then T must equal S.

In our case, for the element φ(h) in H&#x27;, we have two maps: S&#x27; and φ∘S. Both need to satisfy the antipode equation. Let&#x27;s verify.

For S&#x27;, we already know that μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

For φ∘S, we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ⊗φ)Δ_H(h) = φ(μ_H(id⊗S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_Hε_H(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

So both φ∘S and S&#x27; satisfy the antipode equation for φ(h). Since the antipode is unique, they must coincide. Therefore, φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. Therefore, φ preserves the antipode. Therefore, φ is a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, that seems to work. So the key point is that the antipode is uniquely determined by the bialgebra structure, so if φ preserves the bialgebra structure, then it has to preserve the antipode. Therefore, yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

But wait, is there a case where the antipode is not unique? I thought in a Hopf algebra the antipode is unique. Let me check. Suppose there are two antipodes S and T. Then for any h, μ(id⊗S)Δ(h) = ηε(h) and μ(id⊗T)Δ(h) = ηε(h). So μ(id⊗(S - T))Δ(h) = 0. If the Hopf algebra is such that the map μ(id⊗f)Δ is injective for f = S - T, then S - T = 0, so S = T. But does this hold?

Alternatively, perhaps using the convolution algebra. The antipode is the inverse of the identity map in the convolution algebra. Since the convolution algebra is an algebra, inverses are unique. Therefore, the antipode is unique. Therefore, if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ∘S and S&#x27;∘φ both satisfy the antipode property, so they must be equal. Therefore, φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, a bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, but I remember that in some books, they define a Hopf algebra map as a bialgebra map that also preserves the antipode. So maybe the question is whether this is redundant. And according to this reasoning, yes, it is redundant. So the answer should be yes.

But let me see if I can find a counterexample. Suppose H and H&#x27; are Hopf algebras, and φ is a bialgebra map that does not preserve the antipode. Then, according to the above, this is impossible. But is there a concrete example?

Wait, take a commutative Hopf algebra, like the group algebra of an abelian group. Suppose φ is a bialgebra map. Then, since the group algebra is cocommutative, maybe the antipode is just the inverse in the group. If φ is a bialgebra map, it&#x27;s a group homomorphism, so it should preserve inverses. Therefore, φ(S(g)) = φ(g^{-1}) = φ(g)^{-1} = S&#x27;(φ(g)). So in this case, it works.

Another example: universal enveloping algebras. If φ: U(g) → U(g&#x27;) is a bialgebra map, then it&#x27;s induced by a Lie algebra map g → g&#x27;. The antipode in U(g) is given by S(x) = -x for x in g. So if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ(S(x)) = φ(-x) = -φ(x) = S&#x27;(φ(x)). So again, it preserves the antipode.

Hmm. Maybe in general, the antipode is a kind of &quot;inverse&quot; in the convolution algebra, and since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves convolution products. Therefore, if S is the inverse of id in H, then φ(S) should be the inverse of φ(id) = id in H&#x27;, which is S&#x27;. Therefore, φ(S) = S&#x27;.

Yes, this makes sense. In the convolution algebra Hom(H, H&#x27;), φ being a bialgebra map, we can consider the convolution product. The antipode S in H is the inverse of id_H in the convolution algebra Hom(H, H), and S&#x27; is the inverse of id_{H&#x27;} in Hom(H&#x27;, H&#x27;). Since φ is a bialgebra map, it is a morphism of convolution algebras. Therefore, φ sends inverses to inverses, so φ(S) = S&#x27; ∘ φ.

Therefore, this shows that φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}

Given two Hopf algebras \( H \) and \( H&#x27; \), and a bialgebra map \( \phi: H \to H&#x27; \), we need to determine if \( \phi \) automatically preserves the antipode, making it a Hopf algebra map.

1. **Definitions and Properties**:
   - A Hopf algebra has an antipode \( S \) satisfying \( \mu \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta = \eta \circ \epsilon \).
   - A bialgebra map \( \phi \) preserves the algebra and coalgebra structures: 
     - \( \phi \circ \mu_H = \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (\phi \otimes \phi) \)
     - \( \Delta_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = (\phi \otimes \phi) \circ \Delta_H \)
     - \( \phi \circ \eta_H = \eta_{H&#x27;} \)
     - \( \epsilon_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = \epsilon_H \)

2. **Antipode Preservation**:
   - For \( h \in H \), the antipode property in \( H \) is \( \mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h) = \eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h) \).
   - Applying \( \phi \) to both sides, we get \( \phi(\mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h)) = \phi(\eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h)) \).
   - Using the bialgebra map properties, this becomes \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes \phi \circ S) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).

3. **Uniqueness of the Antipode**:
   - In \( H&#x27; \), the antipode \( S&#x27; \) satisfies \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes S&#x27;) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).
   - Both \( \phi \circ S \) and \( S&#x27; \circ \phi \) satisfy the same antipode equation in \( H&#x27; \).
   - Since the antipode in a Hopf algebra is unique, \( \phi \circ S = S&#x27; \circ \phi \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The uniqueness of the antipode and the properties of the bialgebra map ensure that \( \phi \) must preserve the antipode.
   - Therefore, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this question: If I have two Hopf algebras, H and H&#x27;, and a bialgebra map φ between them, does φ automatically preserve the antipode? In other words, is φ necessarily a Hopf algebra map? Hmm, let&#x27;s think.

First, let me recall some definitions. A Hopf algebra is a bialgebra with an antipode map S satisfying certain properties. A bialgebra map is a linear map that is both an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism. So the question is whether such a map must also commute with the antipode.

I remember that in some cases, the antipode is unique if it exists. Maybe that uniqueness forces φ to preserve it. Let me check. Suppose φ: H → H&#x27; is a bialgebra map. Since H and H&#x27; are Hopf algebras, they have antipodes S and S&#x27; respectively. We need to see if φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ.

Let&#x27;s recall the defining property of the antipode. For any h in H, we have:

μ_H∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ_H(h) = η_H∘ε_H(h)

where μ_H is the multiplication, Δ_H is the comultiplication, η_H is the unit, and ε_H is the counit. Similarly, in H&#x27;:

μ_{H&#x27;}∘(id ⊗ S&#x27;)∘Δ_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;) = η_{H&#x27;}∘ε_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;)

for any h&#x27; in H&#x27;.

Since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves the multiplication, comultiplication, unit, and counit. So φ∘μ_H = μ_{H&#x27;}∘(φ ⊗ φ), Δ_{H&#x27;}∘φ = (φ ⊗ φ)∘Δ_H, φ∘η_H = η_{H&#x27;}, and ε_{H&#x27;}∘φ = ε_H.

Now, let&#x27;s try to compute φ(S(h)) and S&#x27;(φ(h)) and see if they are equal.

Start with φ applied to the antipode equation in H:

φ(μ_H(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_H(ε_H(h)))

Since φ is an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism, this becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(φ ⊗ φ)(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

But φ is a coalgebra map, so Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = (φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h). Therefore, substituting, the left side becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

On the right side, we have η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))) which is the same as applying the antipode equation in H&#x27; to φ(h):

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

Therefore, both sides are equal to η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))). So we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

Which implies that:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ (φ∘S - S&#x27;∘φ))Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = 0

Hmm. So if the Hopf algebra H&#x27; has the property that the map μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ f)Δ_{H&#x27;} is injective for any linear map f, then this would force φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a general property of Hopf algebras. Alternatively, maybe we can use the uniqueness of the antipode.

In a Hopf algebra, the antipode is the unique linear map S such that μ∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ = η∘ε. So if we have another map T such that μ∘(id ⊗ T)∘Δ = η∘ε, then T must equal S.

In our case, for the element φ(h) in H&#x27;, we have two maps: S&#x27; and φ∘S. Both need to satisfy the antipode equation. Let&#x27;s verify.

For S&#x27;, we already know that μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

For φ∘S, we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ⊗φ)Δ_H(h) = φ(μ_H(id⊗S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_Hε_H(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

So both φ∘S and S&#x27; satisfy the antipode equation for φ(h). Since the antipode is unique, they must coincide. Therefore, φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. Therefore, φ preserves the antipode. Therefore, φ is a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, that seems to work. So the key point is that the antipode is uniquely determined by the bialgebra structure, so if φ preserves the bialgebra structure, then it has to preserve the antipode. Therefore, yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

But wait, is there a case where the antipode is not unique? I thought in a Hopf algebra the antipode is unique. Let me check. Suppose there are two antipodes S and T. Then for any h, μ(id⊗S)Δ(h) = ηε(h) and μ(id⊗T)Δ(h) = ηε(h). So μ(id⊗(S - T))Δ(h) = 0. If the Hopf algebra is such that the map μ(id⊗f)Δ is injective for f = S - T, then S - T = 0, so S = T. But does this hold?

Alternatively, perhaps using the convolution algebra. The antipode is the inverse of the identity map in the convolution algebra. Since the convolution algebra is an algebra, inverses are unique. Therefore, the antipode is unique. Therefore, if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ∘S and S&#x27;∘φ both satisfy the antipode property, so they must be equal. Therefore, φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, a bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, but I remember that in some books, they define a Hopf algebra map as a bialgebra map that also preserves the antipode. So maybe the question is whether this is redundant. And according to this reasoning, yes, it is redundant. So the answer should be yes.

But let me see if I can find a counterexample. Suppose H and H&#x27; are Hopf algebras, and φ is a bialgebra map that does not preserve the antipode. Then, according to the above, this is impossible. But is there a concrete example?

Wait, take a commutative Hopf algebra, like the group algebra of an abelian group. Suppose φ is a bialgebra map. Then, since the group algebra is cocommutative, maybe the antipode is just the inverse in the group. If φ is a bialgebra map, it&#x27;s a group homomorphism, so it should preserve inverses. Therefore, φ(S(g)) = φ(g^{-1}) = φ(g)^{-1} = S&#x27;(φ(g)). So in this case, it works.

Another example: universal enveloping algebras. If φ: U(g) → U(g&#x27;) is a bialgebra map, then it&#x27;s induced by a Lie algebra map g → g&#x27;. The antipode in U(g) is given by S(x) = -x for x in g. So if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ(S(x)) = φ(-x) = -φ(x) = S&#x27;(φ(x)). So again, it preserves the antipode.

Hmm. Maybe in general, the antipode is a kind of &quot;inverse&quot; in the convolution algebra, and since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves convolution products. Therefore, if S is the inverse of id in H, then φ(S) should be the inverse of φ(id) = id in H&#x27;, which is S&#x27;. Therefore, φ(S) = S&#x27;.

Yes, this makes sense. In the convolution algebra Hom(H, H&#x27;), φ being a bialgebra map, we can consider the convolution product. The antipode S in H is the inverse of id_H in the convolution algebra Hom(H, H), and S&#x27; is the inverse of id_{H&#x27;} in Hom(H&#x27;, H&#x27;). Since φ is a bialgebra map, it is a morphism of convolution algebras. Therefore, φ sends inverses to inverses, so φ(S) = S&#x27; ∘ φ.

Therefore, this shows that φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Given two Hopf algebras \( H \) and \( H&#x27; \), and a bialgebra map \( \phi: H \to H&#x27; \), we need to determine if \( \phi \) automatically preserves the antipode, making it a Hopf algebra map.

1. **Definitions and Properties**:
   - A Hopf algebra has an antipode \( S \) satisfying \( \mu \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta = \eta \circ \epsilon \).
   - A bialgebra map \( \phi \) preserves the algebra and coalgebra structures: 
     - \( \phi \circ \mu_H = \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (\phi \otimes \phi) \)
     - \( \Delta_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = (\phi \otimes \phi) \circ \Delta_H \)
     - \( \phi \circ \eta_H = \eta_{H&#x27;} \)
     - \( \epsilon_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = \epsilon_H \)

2. **Antipode Preservation**:
   - For \( h \in H \), the antipode property in \( H \) is \( \mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h) = \eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h) \).
   - Applying \( \phi \) to both sides, we get \( \phi(\mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h)) = \phi(\eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h)) \).
   - Using the bialgebra map properties, this becomes \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes \phi \circ S) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).

3. **Uniqueness of the Antipode**:
   - In \( H&#x27; \), the antipode \( S&#x27; \) satisfies \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes S&#x27;) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).
   - Both \( \phi \circ S \) and \( S&#x27; \circ \phi \) satisfy the same antipode equation in \( H&#x27; \).
   - Since the antipode in a Hopf algebra is unique, \( \phi \circ S = S&#x27; \circ \phi \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The uniqueness of the antipode and the properties of the bialgebra map ensure that \( \phi \) must preserve the antipode.
   - Therefore, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Let&#x27;s recall the defining property of the antipode. For any h in H, we have:

μ_H∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ_H(h) = η_H∘ε_H(h)

where μ_H is the multiplication, Δ_H is the comultiplication, η_H is the unit, and ε_H is the counit. Similarly, in H&#x27;:

μ_{H&#x27;}∘(id ⊗ S&#x27;)∘Δ_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;) = η_{H&#x27;}∘ε_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;)

for any h&#x27; in H&#x27;.

Since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves the multiplication, comultiplication, unit, and counit. So φ∘μ_H = μ_{H&#x27;}∘(φ ⊗ φ), Δ_{H&#x27;}∘φ = (φ ⊗ φ)∘Δ_H, φ∘η_H = η_{H&#x27;}, and ε_{H&#x27;}∘φ = ε_H.

Now, let&#x27;s try to compute φ(S(h)) and S&#x27;(φ(h)) and see if they are equal.

Start with φ applied to the antipode equation in H:

φ(μ_H(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_H(ε_H(h)))

Since φ is an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism, this becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(φ ⊗ φ)(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

But φ is a coalgebra map, so Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = (φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h). Therefore, substituting, the left side becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

On the right side, we have η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))) which is the same as applying the antipode equation in H&#x27; to φ(h):

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

Therefore, both sides are equal to η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))). So we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

Which implies that:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ (φ∘S - S&#x27;∘φ))Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = 0

Hmm. So if the Hopf algebra H&#x27; has the property that the map μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ f)Δ_{H&#x27;} is injective for any linear map f, then this would force φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a general property of Hopf algebras. Alternatively, maybe we can use the uniqueness of the antipode.

In a Hopf algebra, the antipode is the unique linear map S such that μ∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ = η∘ε. So if we have another map T such that μ∘(id ⊗ T)∘Δ = η∘ε, then T must equal S.

In our case, for the element φ(h) in H&#x27;, we have two maps: S&#x27; and φ∘S. Both need to satisfy the antipode equation. Let&#x27;s verify.

For S&#x27;, we already know that μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

For φ∘S, we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ⊗φ)Δ_H(h) = φ(μ_H(id⊗S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_Hε_H(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

So both φ∘S and S&#x27; satisfy the antipode equation for φ(h). Since the antipode is unique, they must coincide. Therefore, φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. Therefore, φ preserves the antipode. Therefore, φ is a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, that seems to work. So the key point is that the antipode is uniquely determined by the bialgebra structure, so if φ preserves the bialgebra structure, then it has to preserve the antipode. Therefore, yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Then for any h, μ(id⊗S)Δ(h) = ηε(h) and μ(id⊗T)Δ(h) = ηε(h). So μ(id⊗(S - T))Δ(h) = 0. If the Hopf algebra is such that the map μ(id⊗f)Δ is injective for f = S - T, then S - T = 0, so S = T. But does this hold?

Alternatively, perhaps using the convolution algebra. The antipode is the inverse of the identity map in the convolution algebra. Since the convolution algebra is an algebra, inverses are unique. Therefore, the antipode is unique. Therefore, if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ∘S and S&#x27;∘φ both satisfy the antipode property, so they must be equal. Therefore, φ must preserve the antipode.

Then, since the group algebra is cocommutative, maybe the antipode is just the inverse in the group. If φ is a bialgebra map, it&#x27;s a group homomorphism, so it should preserve inverses. Therefore, φ(S(g)) = φ(g^{-1}) = φ(g)^{-1} = S&#x27;(φ(g)). So in this case, it works.

Another example: universal enveloping algebras. If φ: U(g) → U(g&#x27;) is a bialgebra map, then it&#x27;s induced by a Lie algebra map g → g&#x27;. The antipode in U(g) is given by S(x) = -x for x in g. So if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ(S(x)) = φ(-x) = -φ(x) = S&#x27;(φ(x)). So again, it preserves the antipode.

Yes, this makes sense. In the convolution algebra Hom(H, H&#x27;), φ being a bialgebra map, we can consider the convolution product. The antipode S in H is the inverse of id_H in the convolution algebra Hom(H, H), and S&#x27; is the inverse of id_{H&#x27;} in Hom(H&#x27;, H&#x27;). Since φ is a bialgebra map, it is a morphism of convolution algebras. Therefore, φ sends inverses to inverses, so φ(S) = S&#x27; ∘ φ.

Therefore, this shows that φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given two Hopf algebras \( H \) and \( H&#x27; \), and a bialgebra map \( \phi: H \to H&#x27; \), we need to determine if \( \phi \) automatically preserves the antipode, making it a Hopf algebra map.

1. **Definitions and Properties**:
   - A Hopf algebra has an antipode \( S \) satisfying \( \mu \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta = \eta \circ \epsilon \).
   - A bialgebra map \( \phi \) preserves the algebra and coalgebra structures: 
     - \( \phi \circ \mu_H = \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (\phi \otimes \phi) \)
     - \( \Delta_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = (\phi \otimes \phi) \circ \Delta_H \)
     - \( \phi \circ \eta_H = \eta_{H&#x27;} \)
     - \( \epsilon_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = \epsilon_H \)

2. **Antipode Preservation**:
   - For \( h \in H \), the antipode property in \( H \) is \( \mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h) = \eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h) \).
   - Applying \( \phi \) to both sides, we get \( \phi(\mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h)) = \phi(\eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h)) \).
   - Using the bialgebra map properties, this becomes \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes \phi \circ S) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).

3. **Uniqueness of the Antipode**:
   - In \( H&#x27; \), the antipode \( S&#x27; \) satisfies \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes S&#x27;) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).
   - Both \( \phi \circ S \) and \( S&#x27; \circ \phi \) satisfy the same antipode equation in \( H&#x27; \).
   - Since the antipode in a Hopf algebra is unique, \( \phi \circ S = S&#x27; \circ \phi \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The uniqueness of the antipode and the properties of the bialgebra map ensure that \( \phi \) must preserve the antipode.
   - Therefore, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this question: If I have two Hopf algebras, H and H&#x27;, and a bialgebra map φ between them, does φ automatically preserve the antipode? In other words, is φ necessarily a Hopf algebra map? Hmm, let&#x27;s think.

First, let me recall some definitions. A Hopf algebra is a bialgebra with an antipode map S satisfying certain properties. A bialgebra map is a linear map that is both an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism. So the question is whether such a map must also commute with the antipode.

I remember that in some cases, the antipode is unique if it exists. Maybe that uniqueness forces φ to preserve it. Let me check. Suppose φ: H → H&#x27; is a bialgebra map. Since H and H&#x27; are Hopf algebras, they have antipodes S and S&#x27; respectively. We need to see if φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ.

Let&#x27;s recall the defining property of the antipode. For any h in H, we have:

μ_H∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ_H(h) = η_H∘ε_H(h)

where μ_H is the multiplication, Δ_H is the comultiplication, η_H is the unit, and ε_H is the counit. Similarly, in H&#x27;:

μ_{H&#x27;}∘(id ⊗ S&#x27;)∘Δ_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;) = η_{H&#x27;}∘ε_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;)

for any h&#x27; in H&#x27;.

Since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves the multiplication, comultiplication, unit, and counit. So φ∘μ_H = μ_{H&#x27;}∘(φ ⊗ φ), Δ_{H&#x27;}∘φ = (φ ⊗ φ)∘Δ_H, φ∘η_H = η_{H&#x27;}, and ε_{H&#x27;}∘φ = ε_H.

Now, let&#x27;s try to compute φ(S(h)) and S&#x27;(φ(h)) and see if they are equal.

Start with φ applied to the antipode equation in H:

φ(μ_H(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_H(ε_H(h)))

Since φ is an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism, this becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(φ ⊗ φ)(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

But φ is a coalgebra map, so Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = (φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h). Therefore, substituting, the left side becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

On the right side, we have η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))) which is the same as applying the antipode equation in H&#x27; to φ(h):

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

Therefore, both sides are equal to η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))). So we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

Which implies that:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ (φ∘S - S&#x27;∘φ))Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = 0

Hmm. So if the Hopf algebra H&#x27; has the property that the map μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ f)Δ_{H&#x27;} is injective for any linear map f, then this would force φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a general property of Hopf algebras. Alternatively, maybe we can use the uniqueness of the antipode.

In a Hopf algebra, the antipode is the unique linear map S such that μ∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ = η∘ε. So if we have another map T such that μ∘(id ⊗ T)∘Δ = η∘ε, then T must equal S.

In our case, for the element φ(h) in H&#x27;, we have two maps: S&#x27; and φ∘S. Both need to satisfy the antipode equation. Let&#x27;s verify.

For S&#x27;, we already know that μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

For φ∘S, we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ⊗φ)Δ_H(h) = φ(μ_H(id⊗S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_Hε_H(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

So both φ∘S and S&#x27; satisfy the antipode equation for φ(h). Since the antipode is unique, they must coincide. Therefore, φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. Therefore, φ preserves the antipode. Therefore, φ is a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, that seems to work. So the key point is that the antipode is uniquely determined by the bialgebra structure, so if φ preserves the bialgebra structure, then it has to preserve the antipode. Therefore, yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

But wait, is there a case where the antipode is not unique? I thought in a Hopf algebra the antipode is unique. Let me check. Suppose there are two antipodes S and T. Then for any h, μ(id⊗S)Δ(h) = ηε(h) and μ(id⊗T)Δ(h) = ηε(h). So μ(id⊗(S - T))Δ(h) = 0. If the Hopf algebra is such that the map μ(id⊗f)Δ is injective for f = S - T, then S - T = 0, so S = T. But does this hold?

Alternatively, perhaps using the convolution algebra. The antipode is the inverse of the identity map in the convolution algebra. Since the convolution algebra is an algebra, inverses are unique. Therefore, the antipode is unique. Therefore, if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ∘S and S&#x27;∘φ both satisfy the antipode property, so they must be equal. Therefore, φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, a bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, but I remember that in some books, they define a Hopf algebra map as a bialgebra map that also preserves the antipode. So maybe the question is whether this is redundant. And according to this reasoning, yes, it is redundant. So the answer should be yes.

But let me see if I can find a counterexample. Suppose H and H&#x27; are Hopf algebras, and φ is a bialgebra map that does not preserve the antipode. Then, according to the above, this is impossible. But is there a concrete example?

Wait, take a commutative Hopf algebra, like the group algebra of an abelian group. Suppose φ is a bialgebra map. Then, since the group algebra is cocommutative, maybe the antipode is just the inverse in the group. If φ is a bialgebra map, it&#x27;s a group homomorphism, so it should preserve inverses. Therefore, φ(S(g)) = φ(g^{-1}) = φ(g)^{-1} = S&#x27;(φ(g)). So in this case, it works.

Another example: universal enveloping algebras. If φ: U(g) → U(g&#x27;) is a bialgebra map, then it&#x27;s induced by a Lie algebra map g → g&#x27;. The antipode in U(g) is given by S(x) = -x for x in g. So if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ(S(x)) = φ(-x) = -φ(x) = S&#x27;(φ(x)). So again, it preserves the antipode.

Hmm. Maybe in general, the antipode is a kind of &quot;inverse&quot; in the convolution algebra, and since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves convolution products. Therefore, if S is the inverse of id in H, then φ(S) should be the inverse of φ(id) = id in H&#x27;, which is S&#x27;. Therefore, φ(S) = S&#x27;.

Yes, this makes sense. In the convolution algebra Hom(H, H&#x27;), φ being a bialgebra map, we can consider the convolution product. The antipode S in H is the inverse of id_H in the convolution algebra Hom(H, H), and S&#x27; is the inverse of id_{H&#x27;} in Hom(H&#x27;, H&#x27;). Since φ is a bialgebra map, it is a morphism of convolution algebras. Therefore, φ sends inverses to inverses, so φ(S) = S&#x27; ∘ φ.

Therefore, this shows that φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given two Hopf algebras \( H \) and \( H&#x27; \), and a bialgebra map \( \phi: H \to H&#x27; \), we need to determine if \( \phi \) automatically preserves the antipode, making it a Hopf algebra map.

1. **Definitions and Properties**:
   - A Hopf algebra has an antipode \( S \) satisfying \( \mu \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta = \eta \circ \epsilon \).
   - A bialgebra map \( \phi \) preserves the algebra and coalgebra structures: 
     - \( \phi \circ \mu_H = \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (\phi \otimes \phi) \)
     - \( \Delta_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = (\phi \otimes \phi) \circ \Delta_H \)
     - \( \phi \circ \eta_H = \eta_{H&#x27;} \)
     - \( \epsilon_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = \epsilon_H \)

2. **Antipode Preservation**:
   - For \( h \in H \), the antipode property in \( H \) is \( \mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h) = \eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h) \).
   - Applying \( \phi \) to both sides, we get \( \phi(\mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h)) = \phi(\eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h)) \).
   - Using the bialgebra map properties, this becomes \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes \phi \circ S) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).

3. **Uniqueness of the Antipode**:
   - In \( H&#x27; \), the antipode \( S&#x27; \) satisfies \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes S&#x27;) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).
   - Both \( \phi \circ S \) and \( S&#x27; \circ \phi \) satisfy the same antipode equation in \( H&#x27; \).
   - Since the antipode in a Hopf algebra is unique, \( \phi \circ S = S&#x27; \circ \phi \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The uniqueness of the antipode and the properties of the bialgebra map ensure that \( \phi \) must preserve the antipode.
   - Therefore, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Let&#x27;s recall the defining property of the antipode. For any h in H, we have:

μ_H∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ_H(h) = η_H∘ε_H(h)

where μ_H is the multiplication, Δ_H is the comultiplication, η_H is the unit, and ε_H is the counit. Similarly, in H&#x27;:

μ_{H&#x27;}∘(id ⊗ S&#x27;)∘Δ_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;) = η_{H&#x27;}∘ε_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;)

for any h&#x27; in H&#x27;.

Since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves the multiplication, comultiplication, unit, and counit. So φ∘μ_H = μ_{H&#x27;}∘(φ ⊗ φ), Δ_{H&#x27;}∘φ = (φ ⊗ φ)∘Δ_H, φ∘η_H = η_{H&#x27;}, and ε_{H&#x27;}∘φ = ε_H.

Now, let&#x27;s try to compute φ(S(h)) and S&#x27;(φ(h)) and see if they are equal.

Start with φ applied to the antipode equation in H:

φ(μ_H(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_H(ε_H(h)))

Since φ is an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism, this becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(φ ⊗ φ)(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

But φ is a coalgebra map, so Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = (φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h). Therefore, substituting, the left side becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

On the right side, we have η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))) which is the same as applying the antipode equation in H&#x27; to φ(h):

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

Therefore, both sides are equal to η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))). So we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

Which implies that:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ (φ∘S - S&#x27;∘φ))Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = 0

Hmm. So if the Hopf algebra H&#x27; has the property that the map μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ f)Δ_{H&#x27;} is injective for any linear map f, then this would force φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a general property of Hopf algebras. Alternatively, maybe we can use the uniqueness of the antipode.

In a Hopf algebra, the antipode is the unique linear map S such that μ∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ = η∘ε. So if we have another map T such that μ∘(id ⊗ T)∘Δ = η∘ε, then T must equal S.

In our case, for the element φ(h) in H&#x27;, we have two maps: S&#x27; and φ∘S. Both need to satisfy the antipode equation. Let&#x27;s verify.

For S&#x27;, we already know that μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

For φ∘S, we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ⊗φ)Δ_H(h) = φ(μ_H(id⊗S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_Hε_H(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

So both φ∘S and S&#x27; satisfy the antipode equation for φ(h). Since the antipode is unique, they must coincide. Therefore, φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. Therefore, φ preserves the antipode. Therefore, φ is a Hopf algebra map.

Then for any h, μ(id⊗S)Δ(h) = ηε(h) and μ(id⊗T)Δ(h) = ηε(h). So μ(id⊗(S - T))Δ(h) = 0. If the Hopf algebra is such that the map μ(id⊗f)Δ is injective for f = S - T, then S - T = 0, so S = T. But does this hold?

Alternatively, perhaps using the convolution algebra. The antipode is the inverse of the identity map in the convolution algebra. Since the convolution algebra is an algebra, inverses are unique.

\boxed{Yes}

Given two Hopf algebras \( H \) and \( H&#x27; \), and a bialgebra map \( \phi: H \to H&#x27; \), we need to determine if \( \phi \) automatically preserves the antipode, making it a Hopf algebra map.

1. **Definitions and Properties**:
   - A Hopf algebra has an antipode \( S \) satisfying \( \mu \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta = \eta \circ \epsilon \).
   - A bialgebra map \( \phi \) preserves the algebra and coalgebra structures: 
     - \( \phi \circ \mu_H = \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (\phi \otimes \phi) \)
     - \( \Delta_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = (\phi \otimes \phi) \circ \Delta_H \)
     - \( \phi \circ \eta_H = \eta_{H&#x27;} \)
     - \( \epsilon_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = \epsilon_H \)

2. **Antipode Preservation**:
   - For \( h \in H \), the antipode property in \( H \) is \( \mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h) = \eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h) \).
   - Applying \( \phi \) to both sides, we get \( \phi(\mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h)) = \phi(\eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h)) \).
   - Using the bialgebra map properties, this becomes \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes \phi \circ S) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).

3. **Uniqueness of the Antipode**:
   - In \( H&#x27; \), the antipode \( S&#x27; \) satisfies \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes S&#x27;) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).
   - Both \( \phi \circ S \) and \( S&#x27; \circ \phi \) satisfy the same antipode equation in \( H&#x27; \).
   - Since the antipode in a Hopf algebra is unique, \( \phi \circ S = S&#x27; \circ \phi \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The uniqueness of the antipode and the properties of the bialgebra map ensure that \( \phi \) must preserve the antipode.
   - Therefore, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves the multiplication, comultiplication, unit, and counit. So φ∘μ_H = μ_{H&#x27;}∘(φ ⊗ φ), Δ_{H&#x27;}∘φ = (φ ⊗ φ)∘Δ_H, φ∘η_H = η_{H&#x27;}, and ε_{H&#x27;}∘φ = ε_H.

Now, let&#x27;s try to compute φ(S(h)) and S&#x27;(φ(h)) and see if they are equal.

Start with φ applied to the antipode equation in H:

φ(μ_H(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_H(ε_H(h)))

Since φ is an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism, this becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(φ ⊗ φ)(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

But φ is a coalgebra map, so Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = (φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h). Therefore, substituting, the left side becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

On the right side, we have η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))) which is the same as applying the antipode equation in H&#x27; to φ(h):

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

Therefore, both sides are equal to η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))). So we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

Which implies that:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ (φ∘S - S&#x27;∘φ))Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = 0

Hmm. So if the Hopf algebra H&#x27; has the property that the map μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ f)Δ_{H&#x27;} is injective for any linear map f, then this would force φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a general property of Hopf algebras. Alternatively, maybe we can use the uniqueness of the antipode.

In a Hopf algebra, the antipode is the unique linear map S such that μ∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ = η∘ε. So if we have another map T such that μ∘(id ⊗ T)∘Δ = η∘ε, then T must equal S.

In our case, for the element φ(h) in H&#x27;, we have two maps: S&#x27; and φ∘S. Both need to satisfy the antipode equation. Let&#x27;s verify.

For S&#x27;, we already know that μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

For φ∘S, we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ⊗φ)Δ_H(h) = φ(μ_H(id⊗S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_Hε_H(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

So both φ∘S and S&#x27; satisfy the antipode equation for φ(h). Since the antipode is unique, they must coincide. Therefore, φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. Therefore, φ preserves the antipode. Therefore, φ is a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, that seems to work. So the key point is that the antipode is uniquely determined by the bialgebra structure, so if φ preserves the bialgebra structure, then it has to preserve the antipode. Therefore, yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

But wait, is there a case where the antipode is not unique? I thought in a Hopf algebra the antipode is unique. Let me check. Suppose there are two antipodes S and T. Then for any h, μ(id⊗S)Δ(h) = ηε(h) and μ(id⊗T)Δ(h) = ηε(h). So μ(id⊗(S - T))Δ(h) = 0. If the Hopf algebra is such that the map μ(id⊗f)Δ is injective for f = S - T, then S - T = 0, so S = T. But does this hold?

Alternatively, perhaps using the convolution algebra. The antipode is the inverse of the identity map in the convolution algebra. Since the convolution algebra is an algebra, inverses are unique. Therefore, the antipode is unique. Therefore, if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ∘S and S&#x27;∘φ both satisfy the antipode property, so they must be equal. Therefore, φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, a bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, but I remember that in some books, they define a Hopf algebra map as a bialgebra map that also preserves the antipode. So maybe the question is whether this is redundant. And according to this reasoning, yes, it is redundant. So the answer should be yes.

But let me see if I can find a counterexample. Suppose H and H&#x27; are Hopf algebras, and φ is a bialgebra map that does not preserve the antipode. Then, according to the above, this is impossible. But is there a concrete example?

Wait, take a commutative Hopf algebra, like the group algebra of an abelian group. Suppose φ is a bialgebra map. Then, since the group algebra is cocommutative, maybe the antipode is just the inverse in the group. If φ is a bialgebra map, it&#x27;s a group homomorphism, so it should preserve inverses. Therefore, φ(S(g)) = φ(g^{-1}) = φ(g)^{-1} = S&#x27;(φ(g)). So in this case, it works.

Another example: universal enveloping algebras. If φ: U(g) → U(g&#x27;) is a bialgebra map, then it&#x27;s induced by a Lie algebra map g → g&#x27;. The antipode in U(g) is given by S(x) = -x for x in g. So if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ(S(x)) = φ(-x) = -φ(x) = S&#x27;(φ(x)). So again, it preserves the antipode.

Hmm. Maybe in general, the antipode is a kind of &quot;inverse&quot; in the convolution algebra, and since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves convolution products. Therefore, if S is the inverse of id in H, then φ(S) should be the inverse of φ(id) = id in H&#x27;, which is S&#x27;. Therefore, φ(S) = S&#x27;.

Yes, this makes sense. In the convolution algebra Hom(H, H&#x27;), φ being a bialgebra map, we can consider the convolution product. The antipode S in H is the inverse of id_H in the convolution algebra Hom(H, H), and S&#x27; is the inverse of id_{H&#x27;} in Hom(H&#x27;, H&#x27;). Since φ is a bialgebra map, it is a morphism of convolution algebras. Therefore, φ sends inverses to inverses, so φ(S) = S&#x27; ∘ φ.

Therefore, this shows that φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given two Hopf algebras \( H \) and \( H&#x27; \), and a bialgebra map \( \phi: H \to H&#x27; \), we need to determine if \( \phi \) automatically preserves the antipode, making it a Hopf algebra map.

1. **Definitions and Properties**:
   - A Hopf algebra has an antipode \( S \) satisfying \( \mu \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta = \eta \circ \epsilon \).
   - A bialgebra map \( \phi \) preserves the algebra and coalgebra structures: 
     - \( \phi \circ \mu_H = \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (\phi \otimes \phi) \)
     - \( \Delta_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = (\phi \otimes \phi) \circ \Delta_H \)
     - \( \phi \circ \eta_H = \eta_{H&#x27;} \)
     - \( \epsilon_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = \epsilon_H \)

2. **Antipode Preservation**:
   - For \( h \in H \), the antipode property in \( H \) is \( \mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h) = \eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h) \).
   - Applying \( \phi \) to both sides, we get \( \phi(\mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h)) = \phi(\eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h)) \).
   - Using the bialgebra map properties, this becomes \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes \phi \circ S) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).

3. **Uniqueness of the Antipode**:
   - In \( H&#x27; \), the antipode \( S&#x27; \) satisfies \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes S&#x27;) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).
   - Both \( \phi \circ S \) and \( S&#x27; \circ \phi \) satisfy the same antipode equation in \( H&#x27; \).
   - Since the antipode in a Hopf algebra is unique, \( \phi \circ S = S&#x27; \circ \phi \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The uniqueness of the antipode and the properties of the bialgebra map ensure that \( \phi \) must preserve the antipode.
   - Therefore, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this question: If I have two Hopf algebras, H and H&#x27;, and a bialgebra map φ between them, does φ automatically preserve the antipode? In other words, is φ necessarily a Hopf algebra map? Hmm, let&#x27;s think.

First, let me recall some definitions. A Hopf algebra is a bialgebra with an antipode map S satisfying certain properties. A bialgebra map is a linear map that is both an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism. So the question is whether such a map must also commute with the antipode.

I remember that in some cases, the antipode is unique if it exists. Maybe that uniqueness forces φ to preserve it. Let me check. Suppose φ: H → H&#x27; is a bialgebra map. Since H and H&#x27; are Hopf algebras, they have antipodes S and S&#x27; respectively. We need to see if φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ.

Let&#x27;s recall the defining property of the antipode. For any h in H, we have:

μ_H∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ_H(h) = η_H∘ε_H(h)

where μ_H is the multiplication, Δ_H is the comultiplication, η_H is the unit, and ε_H is the counit. Similarly, in H&#x27;:

μ_{H&#x27;}∘(id ⊗ S&#x27;)∘Δ_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;) = η_{H&#x27;}∘ε_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;)

for any h&#x27; in H&#x27;.

Since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves the multiplication, comultiplication, unit, and counit. So φ∘μ_H = μ_{H&#x27;}∘(φ ⊗ φ), Δ_{H&#x27;}∘φ = (φ ⊗ φ)∘Δ_H, φ∘η_H = η_{H&#x27;}, and ε_{H&#x27;}∘φ = ε_H.

Now, let&#x27;s try to compute φ(S(h)) and S&#x27;(φ(h)) and see if they are equal.

Start with φ applied to the antipode equation in H:

φ(μ_H(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_H(ε_H(h)))

Since φ is an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism, this becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(φ ⊗ φ)(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

But φ is a coalgebra map, so Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = (φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h). Therefore, substituting, the left side becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

On the right side, we have η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))) which is the same as applying the antipode equation in H&#x27; to φ(h):

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

Therefore, both sides are equal to η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))). So we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

Which implies that:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ (φ∘S - S&#x27;∘φ))Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = 0

Hmm. So if the Hopf algebra H&#x27; has the property that the map μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ f)Δ_{H&#x27;} is injective for any linear map f, then this would force φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a general property of Hopf algebras. Alternatively, maybe we can use the uniqueness of the antipode.

In a Hopf algebra, the antipode is the unique linear map S such that μ∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ = η∘ε. So if we have another map T such that μ∘(id ⊗ T)∘Δ = η∘ε, then T must equal S.

In our case, for the element φ(h) in H&#x27;, we have two maps: S&#x27; and φ∘S. Both need to satisfy the antipode equation. Let&#x27;s verify.

For S&#x27;, we already know that μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

For φ∘S, we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ⊗φ)Δ_H(h) = φ(μ_H(id⊗S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_Hε_H(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

So both φ∘S and S&#x27; satisfy the antipode equation for φ(h). Since the antipode is unique, they must coincide. Therefore, φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. Therefore, φ preserves the antipode. Therefore, φ is a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, that seems to work. So the key point is that the antipode is uniquely determined by the bialgebra structure, so if φ preserves the bialgebra structure, then it has to preserve the antipode. Therefore, yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Then for any h, μ(id⊗S)Δ(h) = ηε(h) and μ(id⊗T)Δ(h) = ηε(h). So μ(id⊗(S - T))Δ(h) = 0. If the Hopf algebra is such that the map μ(id⊗f)Δ is injective for f = S - T, then S - T = 0, so S = T. But does this hold?

Alternatively, perhaps using the convolution algebra. The antipode is the inverse of the identity map in the convolution algebra. Since the convolution algebra is an algebra, inverses are unique. Therefore, the antipode is unique. Therefore, if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ∘S and S&#x27;∘φ both satisfy the antipode property, so they must be equal. Therefore, φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, φ(S(g)) = φ(g^{-1}) = φ(g)^{-1} = S&#x27;(φ(g)). So in this case, it works.

Another example: universal enveloping algebras. If φ: U(g) → U(g&#x27;) is a bialgebra map, then it&#x27;s induced by a Lie algebra map g → g&#x27;. The antipode in U(g) is given by S(x) = -x for x in g. So if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ(S(x)) = φ(-x) = -φ(x) = S&#x27;(φ(x)). So again, it preserves the antipode.

Yes, this makes sense. In the convolution algebra Hom(H, H&#x27;), φ being a bialgebra map, we can consider the convolution product. The antipode S in H is the inverse of id_H in the convolution algebra Hom(H, H), and S&#x27; is the inverse of id_{H&#x27;} in Hom(H&#x27;, H&#x27;). Since φ is a bialgebra map, it is a morphism of convolution algebras. Therefore, φ sends inverses to inverses, so φ(S) = S&#x27; ∘ φ.

Therefore, this shows that φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

\boxed{Yes}

Given two Hopf algebras \( H \) and \( H&#x27; \), and a bialgebra map \( \phi: H \to H&#x27; \), we need to determine if \( \phi \) automatically preserves the antipode, making it a Hopf algebra map.

1. **Definitions and Properties**:
   - A Hopf algebra has an antipode \( S \) satisfying \( \mu \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta = \eta \circ \epsilon \).
   - A bialgebra map \( \phi \) preserves the algebra and coalgebra structures: 
     - \( \phi \circ \mu_H = \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (\phi \otimes \phi) \)
     - \( \Delta_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = (\phi \otimes \phi) \circ \Delta_H \)
     - \( \phi \circ \eta_H = \eta_{H&#x27;} \)
     - \( \epsilon_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = \epsilon_H \)

2. **Antipode Preservation**:
   - For \( h \in H \), the antipode property in \( H \) is \( \mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h) = \eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h) \).
   - Applying \( \phi \) to both sides, we get \( \phi(\mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h)) = \phi(\eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h)) \).
   - Using the bialgebra map properties, this becomes \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes \phi \circ S) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).

3. **Uniqueness of the Antipode**:
   - In \( H&#x27; \), the antipode \( S&#x27; \) satisfies \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes S&#x27;) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).
   - Both \( \phi \circ S \) and \( S&#x27; \circ \phi \) satisfy the same antipode equation in \( H&#x27; \).
   - Since the antipode in a Hopf algebra is unique, \( \phi \circ S = S&#x27; \circ \phi \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The uniqueness of the antipode and the properties of the bialgebra map ensure that \( \phi \) must preserve the antipode.
   - Therefore, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

First, let me recall some definitions. A Hopf algebra is a bialgebra with an antipode map S satisfying certain properties. A bialgebra map is a linear map that is both an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism. So the question is whether such a map must also commute with the antipode.

I remember that in some cases, the antipode is unique if it exists. Maybe that uniqueness forces φ to preserve it. Let me check. Suppose φ: H → H&#x27; is a bialgebra map. Since H and H&#x27; are Hopf algebras, they have antipodes S and S&#x27; respectively. We need to see if φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ.

Let&#x27;s recall the defining property of the antipode. For any h in H, we have:

μ_H∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ_H(h) = η_H∘ε_H(h)

where μ_H is the multiplication, Δ_H is the comultiplication, η_H is the unit, and ε_H is the counit. Similarly, in H&#x27;:

μ_{H&#x27;}∘(id ⊗ S&#x27;)∘Δ_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;) = η_{H&#x27;}∘ε_{H&#x27;}(h&#x27;)

for any h&#x27; in H&#x27;.

Since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves the multiplication, comultiplication, unit, and counit. So φ∘μ_H = μ_{H&#x27;}∘(φ ⊗ φ), Δ_{H&#x27;}∘φ = (φ ⊗ φ)∘Δ_H, φ∘η_H = η_{H&#x27;}, and ε_{H&#x27;}∘φ = ε_H.

Now, let&#x27;s try to compute φ(S(h)) and S&#x27;(φ(h)) and see if they are equal.

Start with φ applied to the antipode equation in H:

φ(μ_H(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_H(ε_H(h)))

Since φ is an algebra homomorphism and a coalgebra homomorphism, this becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(φ ⊗ φ)(id ⊗ S)Δ_H(h) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

But φ is a coalgebra map, so Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = (φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h). Therefore, substituting, the left side becomes:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ ⊗ φ)Δ_H(h) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

On the right side, we have η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))) which is the same as applying the antipode equation in H&#x27; to φ(h):

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)))

Therefore, both sides are equal to η_{H&#x27;}(ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))). So we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h))

Which implies that:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ (φ∘S - S&#x27;∘φ))Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = 0

Hmm. So if the Hopf algebra H&#x27; has the property that the map μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ f)Δ_{H&#x27;} is injective for any linear map f, then this would force φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a general property of Hopf algebras. Alternatively, maybe we can use the uniqueness of the antipode.

In a Hopf algebra, the antipode is the unique linear map S such that μ∘(id ⊗ S)∘Δ = η∘ε. So if we have another map T such that μ∘(id ⊗ T)∘Δ = η∘ε, then T must equal S.

In our case, for the element φ(h) in H&#x27;, we have two maps: S&#x27; and φ∘S. Both need to satisfy the antipode equation. Let&#x27;s verify.

For S&#x27;, we already know that μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ S&#x27;)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

For φ∘S, we have:

μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)Δ_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)) = μ_{H&#x27;}(id ⊗ φ∘S)(φ⊗φ)Δ_H(h) = φ(μ_H(id⊗S)Δ_H(h)) = φ(η_Hε_H(h)) = η_{H&#x27;}ε_{H&#x27;}(φ(h)).

So both φ∘S and S&#x27; satisfy the antipode equation for φ(h). Since the antipode is unique, they must coincide. Therefore, φ∘S = S&#x27;∘φ. Therefore, φ preserves the antipode. Therefore, φ is a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, that seems to work. So the key point is that the antipode is uniquely determined by the bialgebra structure, so if φ preserves the bialgebra structure, then it has to preserve the antipode. Therefore, yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

But wait, is there a case where the antipode is not unique? I thought in a Hopf algebra the antipode is unique. Let me check. Suppose there are two antipodes S and T. Then for any h, μ(id⊗S)Δ(h) = ηε(h) and μ(id⊗T)Δ(h) = ηε(h). So μ(id⊗(S - T))Δ(h) = 0. If the Hopf algebra is such that the map μ(id⊗f)Δ is injective for f = S - T, then S - T = 0, so S = T. But does this hold?

Alternatively, perhaps using the convolution algebra. The antipode is the inverse of the identity map in the convolution algebra. Since the convolution algebra is an algebra, inverses are unique. Therefore, the antipode is unique. Therefore, if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ∘S and S&#x27;∘φ both satisfy the antipode property, so they must be equal. Therefore, φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, a bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Wait, but I remember that in some books, they define a Hopf algebra map as a bialgebra map that also preserves the antipode. So maybe the question is whether this is redundant. And according to this reasoning, yes, it is redundant. So the answer should be yes.

But let me see if I can find a counterexample. Suppose H and H&#x27; are Hopf algebras, and φ is a bialgebra map that does not preserve the antipode. Then, according to the above, this is impossible. But is there a concrete example?

Wait, take a commutative Hopf algebra, like the group algebra of an abelian group. Suppose φ is a bialgebra map. Then, since the group algebra is cocommutative, maybe the antipode is just the inverse in the group. If φ is a bialgebra map, it&#x27;s a group homomorphism, so it should preserve inverses. Therefore, φ(S(g)) = φ(g^{-1}) = φ(g)^{-1} = S&#x27;(φ(g)). So in this case, it works.

Another example: universal enveloping algebras. If φ: U(g) → U(g&#x27;) is a bialgebra map, then it&#x27;s induced by a Lie algebra map g → g&#x27;. The antipode in U(g) is given by S(x) = -x for x in g. So if φ is a bialgebra map, then φ(S(x)) = φ(-x) = -φ(x) = S&#x27;(φ(x)). So again, it preserves the antipode.

Hmm. Maybe in general, the antipode is a kind of &quot;inverse&quot; in the convolution algebra, and since φ is a bialgebra map, it preserves convolution products. Therefore, if S is the inverse of id in H, then φ(S) should be the inverse of φ(id) = id in H&#x27;, which is S&#x27;. Therefore, φ(S) = S&#x27;.

Yes, this makes sense. In the convolution algebra Hom(H, H&#x27;), φ being a bialgebra map, we can consider the convolution product. The antipode S in H is the inverse of id_H in the convolution algebra Hom(H, H), and S&#x27; is the inverse of id_{H&#x27;} in Hom(H&#x27;, H&#x27;). Since φ is a bialgebra map, it is a morphism of convolution algebras. Therefore, φ sends inverses to inverses, so φ(S) = S&#x27; ∘ φ.

Therefore, this shows that φ must preserve the antipode.

Therefore, the answer is yes, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given two Hopf algebras \( H \) and \( H&#x27; \), and a bialgebra map \( \phi: H \to H&#x27; \), we need to determine if \( \phi \) automatically preserves the antipode, making it a Hopf algebra map.

1. **Definitions and Properties**:
   - A Hopf algebra has an antipode \( S \) satisfying \( \mu \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta = \eta \circ \epsilon \).
   - A bialgebra map \( \phi \) preserves the algebra and coalgebra structures: 
     - \( \phi \circ \mu_H = \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (\phi \otimes \phi) \)
     - \( \Delta_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = (\phi \otimes \phi) \circ \Delta_H \)
     - \( \phi \circ \eta_H = \eta_{H&#x27;} \)
     - \( \epsilon_{H&#x27;} \circ \phi = \epsilon_H \)

2. **Antipode Preservation**:
   - For \( h \in H \), the antipode property in \( H \) is \( \mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h) = \eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h) \).
   - Applying \( \phi \) to both sides, we get \( \phi(\mu_H \circ (id \otimes S) \circ \Delta_H(h)) = \phi(\eta_H \circ \epsilon_H(h)) \).
   - Using the bialgebra map properties, this becomes \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes \phi \circ S) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).

3. **Uniqueness of the Antipode**:
   - In \( H&#x27; \), the antipode \( S&#x27; \) satisfies \( \mu_{H&#x27;} \circ (id \otimes S&#x27;) \circ \Delta_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) = \eta_{H&#x27;} \circ \epsilon_{H&#x27;}(\phi(h)) \).
   - Both \( \phi \circ S \) and \( S&#x27; \circ \phi \) satisfy the same antipode equation in \( H&#x27; \).
   - Since the antipode in a Hopf algebra is unique, \( \phi \circ S = S&#x27; \circ \phi \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The uniqueness of the antipode and the properties of the bialgebra map ensure that \( \phi \) must preserve the antipode.
   - Therefore, any bialgebra map between Hopf algebras is automatically a Hopf algebra map.

Let $x = CA$. Then $\tan\theta = \tan(\angle BAF - \angle DAE)$, and since $\tan\angle BAF = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{x-2}$ and $\tan\angle DAE = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{x-1}$, we have
\[\tan\theta = \frac{\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{x-2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{x-1}}{1 + \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{x-2}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{3}}{x-1}}= \frac{x\sqrt{3}}{x^2-3x+8}\]
With calculus, taking the derivative and setting equal to zero will give the maximum value of $\tan \theta$. Otherwise, we can apply AM-GM:
\begin{align*} \frac{x^2 - 3x + 8}{x} = \left(x + \frac{8}{x}\right) -3 &amp;\geq 2\sqrt{x \cdot \frac 8x} - 3 = 4\sqrt{2} - 3\\ \frac{x}{x^2 - 3x + 8} &amp;\leq \frac{1}{4\sqrt{2}-3}\\ \frac{x\sqrt{3}}{x^2 - 3x + 8} = \tan \theta &amp;\leq \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4\sqrt{2}-3}\end{align*}
Thus, the maximum is at $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4\sqrt{2}-3}}$.          </p>

Let $x = CA$. Then $\tan\theta = \tan(\angle BAF - \angle DAE)$, and since $\tan\angle BAF = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{x-2}$ and $\tan\angle DAE = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{x-1}$, we have
\[\tan\theta = \frac{\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{x-2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{x-1}}{1 + \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{x-2}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{3}}{x-1}}= \frac{x\sqrt{3}}{x^2-3x+8}\]
With calculus, taking the derivative and setting equal to zero will give the maximum value of $\tan \theta$. Otherwise, we can apply AM-GM:
\begin{align*} \frac{x^2 - 3x + 8}{x} = \left(x + \frac{8}{x}\right) -3 &amp;\geq 2\sqrt{x \cdot \frac 8x} - 3 = 4\sqrt{2} - 3\\ \frac{x}{x^2 - 3x + 8} &amp;\leq \frac{1}{4\sqrt{2}-3}\\ \frac{x\sqrt{3}}{x^2 - 3x + 8} = \tan \theta &amp;\leq \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4\sqrt{2}-3}\end{align*}
Thus, the maximum is at $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4\sqrt{2}-3}}$.          </p>

Let $x = CA$. Then $\tan\theta = \tan(\angle BAF - \angle DAE)$, and since $\tan\angle BAF = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{x-2}$ and $\tan\angle DAE = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{x-1}$, we have
\[\tan\theta = \frac{\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{x-2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{x-1}}{1 + \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{x-2}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{3}}{x-1}}= \frac{x\sqrt{3}}{x^2-3x+8}\]
With calculus, taking the derivative and setting equal to zero will give the maximum value of $\tan \theta$. Otherwise, we can apply AM-GM:
\begin{align*} \frac{x^2 - 3x + 8}{x} = \left(x + \frac{8}{x}\right) -3 &amp;\geq 2\sqrt{x \cdot \frac 8x} - 3 = 4\sqrt{2} - 3\\ \frac{x}{x^2 - 3x + 8} &amp;\leq \frac{1}{4\sqrt{2}-3}\\ \frac{x\sqrt{3}}{x^2 - 3x + 8} = \tan \theta &amp;\leq \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4\sqrt{2}-3}\end{align*}
Thus, the maximum is at $\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4\sqrt{2}-3}}$.          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find a function \( g(x) \) such that when I compose \( f \) and \( g \), meaning I plug \( g(x) \) into \( f \), I get \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \). The function \( f(x) \) is given as \( x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \). 

Let me write down what I know:

\( f(g(x)) = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \)

and

\( f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \).

So, substituting \( g(x) \) into \( f \), we have:

\( f(g(x)) = [g(x)]^3 - 5[g(x)]^2 + g(x) - 7 \).

This must equal \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \). Therefore, we need to solve for \( g(x) \) in the equation:

\( [g(x)]^3 - 5[g(x)]^2 + g(x) - 7 = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \).

Hmm, solving for \( g(x) \) here seems a bit complicated because it&#x27;s inside a cubic function. Maybe \( g(x) \) is a linear function? That would make sense because composing linear functions with polynomials can result in polynomials of the same degree. Since \( f(g(x)) \) is a cubic polynomial, and \( f(x) \) is cubic, then \( g(x) \) should be linear, right? Because the composition of two cubic functions would result in a 9th degree polynomial, which is not the case here. Wait, no, actually, if \( f(x) \) is cubic and \( g(x) \) is linear, then \( f(g(x)) \) would be a cubic function. If \( g(x) \) were quadratic, then \( f(g(x)) \) would be a 6th degree polynomial, which is not the case here. So, yes, \( g(x) \) is likely linear.

So let&#x27;s assume \( g(x) = ax + b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants to be determined.

Then, substituting into \( f \):

\( f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7 \).

Let me expand this step by step.

First, compute \( (ax + b)^3 \):

\( (ax + b)^3 = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 \).

Then, compute \( -5(ax + b)^2 \):

First, \( (ax + b)^2 = a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2 \), so multiplied by -5:

\( -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 \).

Then, \( (ax + b) \) is just \( ax + b \), so adding that:

\( ax + b \).

Finally, subtracting 7.

So putting all together:

\( f(g(x)) = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 + ax + b -7 \).

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

- The \( x^3 \) term: \( a^3 \).
- The \( x^2 \) terms: \( 3a^2b -5a^2 \).
- The \( x \) terms: \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a \).
- The constant terms: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 \).

This should equal \( 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2 \). Therefore, we can set up equations for each coefficient:

1. Coefficient of \( x^3 \): \( a^3 = 27 \).
2. Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( 3a^2b -5a^2 = 90 \).
3. Coefficient of \( x \): \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a = 78 \).
4. Constant term: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 = -2 \).

Let&#x27;s solve these equations step by step.

First, equation 1: \( a^3 = 27 \). Therefore, \( a = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \). So \( a = 3 \).

Now plug \( a = 3 \) into equation 2:

\( 3*(3)^2*b -5*(3)^2 = 90 \).

Compute that:

\( 3*9*b -5*9 = 90 \).

Simplify:

\( 27b -45 = 90 \).

Add 45 to both sides:

\( 27b = 135 \).

Divide by 27:

\( b = 5 \).

So now, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 5 \). Let&#x27;s check if this works with equation 3 and 4.

First, equation 3 with \( a =3 \), \( b =5 \):

Left-hand side (LHS):

\( 3*(3)*(5)^2 -10*(3)*(5) +3 \).

Compute each term:

First term: \( 3*3*25 = 225 \).

Second term: \( -10*3*5 = -150 \).

Third term: \( 3 \).

Total: \( 225 -150 +3 = 78 \).

Which matches the coefficient of \( x \), which is 78. Good.

Now equation 4:

\( (5)^3 -5*(5)^2 +5 -7 = 125 -125 +5 -7 = (125 -125) + (5 -7) = 0 -2 = -2 \).

Which matches the constant term. Perfect.

Therefore, \( g(x) = 3x +5 \).

Wait, so that&#x27;s the answer? Let me double-check by composing \( f(g(x)) \).

Compute \( f(g(x)) = f(3x +5) = (3x +5)^3 -5*(3x +5)^2 + (3x +5) -7 \).

First, compute \( (3x +5)^3 \):

Let me compute step by step:

First, \( (3x +5)^2 = 9x^2 + 30x +25 \).

Then, \( (3x +5)^3 = (3x +5)*(9x^2 +30x +25) \).

Multiply term by term:

3x*(9x^2) = 27x^3

3x*(30x) = 90x^2

3x*(25) = 75x

5*(9x^2) = 45x^2

5*(30x) = 150x

5*(25) = 125

Add them all up:

27x^3 +90x^2 +75x +45x^2 +150x +125 =

27x^3 + (90x^2 +45x^2) + (75x +150x) +125 =

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125.

Now, compute -5*(3x +5)^2:

We already have \( (3x +5)^2 =9x^2 +30x +25 \), so multiply by -5:

-45x^2 -150x -125.

Then, add (3x +5):

3x +5.

Subtract 7:

So total expression:

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125 -45x^2 -150x -125 +3x +5 -7.

Combine like terms:

- \( x^3 \): 27x^3.

- \( x^2 \): 135x^2 -45x^2 = 90x^2.

- \( x \): 225x -150x +3x = 78x.

- Constants: 125 -125 +5 -7 = (-2).

So indeed, we get 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2, which matches the given polynomial. Therefore, \( g(x) =3x +5 \) is correct.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{3x + 5} \).

**Final Answer**
The function \( g(x) \) is \boxed{3x + 5}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the function \( g(x) \) such that \( f(g(x)) = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \), where \( f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \), we assume \( g(x) \) is a linear function of the form \( g(x) = ax + b \).

Substituting \( g(x) = ax + b \) into \( f(x) \), we get:
\[
f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7
\]

Expanding and combining like terms, we match the coefficients with \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \):

1. The coefficient of \( x^3 \) gives \( a^3 = 27 \), so \( a = 3 \).
2. The coefficient of \( x^2 \) gives \( 3a^2b - 5a^2 = 90 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \), we solve \( 27b - 45 = 90 \) to get \( b = 5 \).
3. The coefficient of \( x \) gives \( 3ab^2 - 10ab + a = 78 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 225 - 150 + 3 = 78 \).
4. The constant term gives \( b^3 - 5b^2 + b - 7 = -2 \). Substituting \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 125 - 125 + 5 - 7 = -2 \).

Thus, \( g(x) = 3x + 5 \) satisfies all conditions. Verifying by composing \( f(g(x)) \) confirms the result.

The function \( g(x) \) is \(\boxed{3x + 5}\).          </p>

This must equal \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \). Therefore, we need to solve for \( g(x) \) in the equation:

\( [g(x)]^3 - 5[g(x)]^2 + g(x) - 7 = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \).

Then, substituting into \( f \):

\( f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7 \).

Let me expand this step by step.

First, compute \( (ax + b)^3 \):

\( (ax + b)^3 = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 \).

Then, compute \( -5(ax + b)^2 \):

First, \( (ax + b)^2 = a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2 \), so multiplied by -5:

\( -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 \).

Then, \( (ax + b) \) is just \( ax + b \), so adding that:

\( ax + b \).

Finally, subtracting 7.

So putting all together:

\( f(g(x)) = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 + ax + b -7 \).

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

- The \( x^3 \) term: \( a^3 \).
- The \( x^2 \) terms: \( 3a^2b -5a^2 \).
- The \( x \) terms: \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a \).
- The constant terms: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 \).

This should equal \( 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2 \). Therefore, we can set up equations for each coefficient:

1. Coefficient of \( x^3 \): \( a^3 = 27 \).
2. Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( 3a^2b -5a^2 = 90 \).
3. Coefficient of \( x \): \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a = 78 \).
4. Constant term: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 = -2 \).

Let&#x27;s solve these equations step by step.

First, equation 1: \( a^3 = 27 \). Therefore, \( a = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \). So \( a = 3 \).

Now plug \( a = 3 \) into equation 2:

\( 3*(3)^2*b -5*(3)^2 = 90 \).

Compute that:

\( 3*9*b -5*9 = 90 \).

Simplify:

\( 27b -45 = 90 \).

Add 45 to both sides:

\( 27b = 135 \).

Divide by 27:

\( b = 5 \).

So now, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 5 \). Let&#x27;s check if this works with equation 3 and 4.

First, equation 3 with \( a =3 \), \( b =5 \):

Left-hand side (LHS):

\( 3*(3)*(5)^2 -10*(3)*(5) +3 \).

Compute each term:

First term: \( 3*3*25 = 225 \).

Second term: \( -10*3*5 = -150 \).

Third term: \( 3 \).

Total: \( 225 -150 +3 = 78 \).

Which matches the coefficient of \( x \), which is 78. Good.

Now equation 4:

\( (5)^3 -5*(5)^2 +5 -7 = 125 -125 +5 -7 = (125 -125) + (5 -7) = 0 -2 = -2 \).

Which matches the constant term. Perfect.

Therefore, \( g(x) = 3x +5 \).

Wait, so that&#x27;s the answer? Let me double-check by composing \( f(g(x)) \).

Compute \( f(g(x)) = f(3x +5) = (3x +5)^3 -5*(3x +5)^2 + (3x +5) -7 \).

First, compute \( (3x +5)^3 \):

Let me compute step by step:

First, \( (3x +5)^2 = 9x^2 + 30x +25 \).

Then, \( (3x +5)^3 = (3x +5)*(9x^2 +30x +25) \).

Multiply term by term:

3x*(9x^2) = 27x^3

3x*(30x) = 90x^2

3x*(25) = 75x

5*(9x^2) = 45x^2

5*(30x) = 150x

5*(25) = 125

Add them all up:

27x^3 +90x^2 +75x +45x^2 +150x +125 =

27x^3 + (90x^2 +45x^2) + (75x +150x) +125 =

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125.

Now, compute -5*(3x +5)^2:

We already have \( (3x +5)^2 =9x^2 +30x +25 \), so multiply by -5:

-45x^2 -150x -125.

Then, add (3x +5):

3x +5.

Subtract 7:

So total expression:

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125 -45x^2 -150x -125 +3x +5 -7.

Combine like terms:

- \( x^3 \): 27x^3.

- \( x^2 \): 135x^2 -45x^2 = 90x^2.

- \( x \): 225x -150x +3x = 78x.

- Constants: 125 -125 +5 -7 = (-2).

So indeed, we get 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2, which matches the given polynomial. Therefore, \( g(x) =3x +5 \) is correct.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{3x + 5} \).

**Final Answer**
The function \( g(x) \) is \boxed{3x + 5}.

Substituting \( g(x) = ax + b \) into \( f(x) \), we get:
\[
f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7
\]

Expanding and combining like terms, we match the coefficients with \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \):

1. The coefficient of \( x^3 \) gives \( a^3 = 27 \), so \( a = 3 \).
2. The coefficient of \( x^2 \) gives \( 3a^2b - 5a^2 = 90 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \), we solve \( 27b - 45 = 90 \) to get \( b = 5 \).
3. The coefficient of \( x \) gives \( 3ab^2 - 10ab + a = 78 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 225 - 150 + 3 = 78 \).
4. The constant term gives \( b^3 - 5b^2 + b - 7 = -2 \). Substituting \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 125 - 125 + 5 - 7 = -2 \).

Thus, \( g(x) = 3x + 5 \) satisfies all conditions. Verifying by composing \( f(g(x)) \) confirms the result.

First, compute \( (ax + b)^3 \):

\( (ax + b)^3 = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 \).

Then, compute \( -5(ax + b)^2 \):

First, \( (ax + b)^2 = a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2 \), so multiplied by -5:

\( -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 \).

Then, \( (ax + b) \) is just \( ax + b \), so adding that:

\( ax + b \).

Finally, subtracting 7.

So putting all together:

\( f(g(x)) = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 + ax + b -7 \).

\( 27b -45 = 90 \).

Add 45 to both sides:

\( 27b = 135 \).

Divide by 27:

\( b = 5 \).

So now, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 5 \). Let&#x27;s check if this works with equation 3 and 4.

First, equation 3 with \( a =3 \), \( b =5 \):

Left-hand side (LHS):

\( 3*(3)*(5)^2 -10*(3)*(5) +3 \).

Compute each term:

First term: \( 3*3*25 = 225 \).

Second term: \( -10*3*5 = -150 \).

Third term: \( 3 \).

Total: \( 225 -150 +3 = 78 \).

Which matches the coefficient of \( x \), which is 78. Good.

Now equation 4:

\( (5)^3 -5*(5)^2 +5 -7 = 125 -125 +5 -7 = (125 -125) + (5 -7) = 0 -2 = -2 \).

Which matches the constant term. Perfect.

Therefore, \( g(x) = 3x +5 \).

Wait, so that&#x27;s the answer? Let me double-check by composing \( f(g(x)) \).

Compute \( f(g(x)) = f(3x +5) = (3x +5)^3 -5*(3x +5)^2 + (3x +5) -7 \).

First, compute \( (3x +5)^3 \):

Let me compute step by step:

First, \( (3x +5)^2 = 9x^2 + 30x +25 \).

Then, \( (3x +5)^3 = (3x +5)*(9x^2 +30x +25) \).

Multiply term by term:

3x*(9x^2) = 27x^3

3x*(30x) = 90x^2

3x*(25) = 75x

5*(9x^2) = 45x^2

5*(30x) = 150x

5*(25) = 125

Add them all up:

27x^3 +90x^2 +75x +45x^2 +150x +125 =

27x^3 + (90x^2 +45x^2) + (75x +150x) +125 =

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125.

Now, compute -5*(3x +5)^2:

We already have \( (3x +5)^2 =9x^2 +30x +25 \), so multiply by -5:

-45x^2 -150x -125.

Then, add (3x +5):

3x +5.

Subtract 7:

So total expression:

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125 -45x^2 -150x -125 +3x +5 -7.

Combine like terms:

- \( x^3 \): 27x^3.

- \( x^2 \): 135x^2 -45x^2 = 90x^2.

- \( x \): 225x -150x +3x = 78x.

- Constants: 125 -125 +5 -7 = (-2).

So indeed, we get 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2, which matches the given polynomial. Therefore, \( g(x) =3x +5 \) is correct.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{3x + 5} \).

**Final Answer**
The function \( g(x) \) is \boxed{3x + 5}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the function \( g(x) \) such that \( f(g(x)) = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \), where \( f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \), we assume \( g(x) \) is a linear function of the form \( g(x) = ax + b \).

Substituting \( g(x) = ax + b \) into \( f(x) \), we get:
\[
f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7
\]

Expanding and combining like terms, we match the coefficients with \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \):

1. The coefficient of \( x^3 \) gives \( a^3 = 27 \), so \( a = 3 \).
2. The coefficient of \( x^2 \) gives \( 3a^2b - 5a^2 = 90 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \), we solve \( 27b - 45 = 90 \) to get \( b = 5 \).
3. The coefficient of \( x \) gives \( 3ab^2 - 10ab + a = 78 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 225 - 150 + 3 = 78 \).
4. The constant term gives \( b^3 - 5b^2 + b - 7 = -2 \). Substituting \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 125 - 125 + 5 - 7 = -2 \).

Thus, \( g(x) = 3x + 5 \) satisfies all conditions. Verifying by composing \( f(g(x)) \) confirms the result.

The function \( g(x) \) is \(\boxed{3x + 5}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find a function \( g(x) \) such that when I compose \( f \) and \( g \), meaning I plug \( g(x) \) into \( f \), I get \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \). The function \( f(x) \) is given as \( x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \). 

Let me write down what I know:

\( f(g(x)) = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \)

and

\( f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \).

So, substituting \( g(x) \) into \( f \), we have:

\( f(g(x)) = [g(x)]^3 - 5[g(x)]^2 + g(x) - 7 \).

This must equal \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \). Therefore, we need to solve for \( g(x) \) in the equation:

\( [g(x)]^3 - 5[g(x)]^2 + g(x) - 7 = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \).

Hmm, solving for \( g(x) \) here seems a bit complicated because it&#x27;s inside a cubic function. Maybe \( g(x) \) is a linear function? That would make sense because composing linear functions with polynomials can result in polynomials of the same degree. Since \( f(g(x)) \) is a cubic polynomial, and \( f(x) \) is cubic, then \( g(x) \) should be linear, right? Because the composition of two cubic functions would result in a 9th degree polynomial, which is not the case here. Wait, no, actually, if \( f(x) \) is cubic and \( g(x) \) is linear, then \( f(g(x)) \) would be a cubic function. If \( g(x) \) were quadratic, then \( f(g(x)) \) would be a 6th degree polynomial, which is not the case here. So, yes, \( g(x) \) is likely linear.

So let&#x27;s assume \( g(x) = ax + b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants to be determined.

Then, substituting into \( f \):

\( f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7 \).

Let me expand this step by step.

First, compute \( (ax + b)^3 \):

\( (ax + b)^3 = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 \).

Then, compute \( -5(ax + b)^2 \):

First, \( (ax + b)^2 = a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2 \), so multiplied by -5:

\( -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 \).

Then, \( (ax + b) \) is just \( ax + b \), so adding that:

\( ax + b \).

Finally, subtracting 7.

So putting all together:

\( f(g(x)) = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 + ax + b -7 \).

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

- The \( x^3 \) term: \( a^3 \).
- The \( x^2 \) terms: \( 3a^2b -5a^2 \).
- The \( x \) terms: \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a \).
- The constant terms: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 \).

This should equal \( 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2 \). Therefore, we can set up equations for each coefficient:

1. Coefficient of \( x^3 \): \( a^3 = 27 \).
2. Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( 3a^2b -5a^2 = 90 \).
3. Coefficient of \( x \): \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a = 78 \).
4. Constant term: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 = -2 \).

Let&#x27;s solve these equations step by step.

First, equation 1: \( a^3 = 27 \). Therefore, \( a = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \). So \( a = 3 \).

Now plug \( a = 3 \) into equation 2:

\( 3*(3)^2*b -5*(3)^2 = 90 \).

Compute that:

\( 3*9*b -5*9 = 90 \).

Simplify:

\( 27b -45 = 90 \).

Add 45 to both sides:

\( 27b = 135 \).

Divide by 27:

\( b = 5 \).

So now, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 5 \). Let&#x27;s check if this works with equation 3 and 4.

First, equation 3 with \( a =3 \), \( b =5 \):

Left-hand side (LHS):

\( 3*(3)*(5)^2 -10*(3)*(5) +3 \).

Compute each term:

First term: \( 3*3*25 = 225 \).

Second term: \( -10*3*5 = -150 \).

Third term: \( 3 \).

Total: \( 225 -150 +3 = 78 \).

Which matches the coefficient of \( x \), which is 78. Good.

Now equation 4:

\( (5)^3 -5*(5)^2 +5 -7 = 125 -125 +5 -7 = (125 -125) + (5 -7) = 0 -2 = -2 \).

Which matches the constant term. Perfect.

Therefore, \( g(x) = 3x +5 \).

Wait, so that&#x27;s the answer? Let me double-check by composing \( f(g(x)) \).

Compute \( f(g(x)) = f(3x +5) = (3x +5)^3 -5*(3x +5)^2 + (3x +5) -7 \).

First, compute \( (3x +5)^3 \):

Let me compute step by step:

First, \( (3x +5)^2 = 9x^2 + 30x +25 \).

Then, \( (3x +5)^3 = (3x +5)*(9x^2 +30x +25) \).

Multiply term by term:

3x*(9x^2) = 27x^3

3x*(30x) = 90x^2

3x*(25) = 75x

5*(9x^2) = 45x^2

5*(30x) = 150x

5*(25) = 125

Add them all up:

27x^3 +90x^2 +75x +45x^2 +150x +125 =

27x^3 + (90x^2 +45x^2) + (75x +150x) +125 =

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125.

Now, compute -5*(3x +5)^2:

We already have \( (3x +5)^2 =9x^2 +30x +25 \), so multiply by -5:

-45x^2 -150x -125.

Then, add (3x +5):

3x +5.

Subtract 7:

So total expression:

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125 -45x^2 -150x -125 +3x +5 -7.

Combine like terms:

- \( x^3 \): 27x^3.

- \( x^2 \): 135x^2 -45x^2 = 90x^2.

- \( x \): 225x -150x +3x = 78x.

- Constants: 125 -125 +5 -7 = (-2).

So indeed, we get 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2, which matches the given polynomial. Therefore, \( g(x) =3x +5 \) is correct.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{3x + 5} \).

**Final Answer**
The function \( g(x) \) is \boxed{3x + 5}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the function \( g(x) \) such that \( f(g(x)) = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \), where \( f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \), we assume \( g(x) \) is a linear function of the form \( g(x) = ax + b \).

Substituting \( g(x) = ax + b \) into \( f(x) \), we get:
\[
f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7
\]

Expanding and combining like terms, we match the coefficients with \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \):

1. The coefficient of \( x^3 \) gives \( a^3 = 27 \), so \( a = 3 \).
2. The coefficient of \( x^2 \) gives \( 3a^2b - 5a^2 = 90 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \), we solve \( 27b - 45 = 90 \) to get \( b = 5 \).
3. The coefficient of \( x \) gives \( 3ab^2 - 10ab + a = 78 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 225 - 150 + 3 = 78 \).
4. The constant term gives \( b^3 - 5b^2 + b - 7 = -2 \). Substituting \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 125 - 125 + 5 - 7 = -2 \).

Thus, \( g(x) = 3x + 5 \) satisfies all conditions. Verifying by composing \( f(g(x)) \) confirms the result.

Then, substituting into \( f \):

\( f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7 \).

Let me expand this step by step.

First, compute \( (ax + b)^3 \):

\( (ax + b)^3 = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 \).

Then, compute \( -5(ax + b)^2 \):

First, \( (ax + b)^2 = a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2 \), so multiplied by -5:

\( -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 \).

Then, \( (ax + b) \) is just \( ax + b \), so adding that:

\( ax + b \).

Finally, subtracting 7.

So putting all together:

\( f(g(x)) = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 + ax + b -7 \).

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

- The \( x^3 \) term: \( a^3 \).
- The \( x^2 \) terms: \( 3a^2b -5a^2 \).
- The \( x \) terms: \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a \).
- The constant terms: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 \).

This should equal \( 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2 \). Therefore, we can set up equations for each coefficient:

1. Coefficient of \( x^3 \): \( a^3 = 27 \).
2. Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( 3a^2b -5a^2 = 90 \).
3. Coefficient of \( x \): \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a = 78 \).
4. Constant term: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 = -2 \).

Let&#x27;s solve these equations step by step.

First, equation 1: \( a^3 = 27 \). Therefore, \( a = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \). So \( a = 3 \).

Now plug \( a = 3 \) into equation 2:

\( 3*(3)^2*b -5*(3)^2 = 90 \).

Compute that:

\( 3*9*b -5*9 = 90 \).

Simplify:

\( 27b -45 = 90 \).

Add 45 to both sides:

\( 27b = 135 \).

Divide by 27:

\( b = 5 \).

So now, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 5 \). Let&#x27;s check if this works with equation 3 and 4.

First, equation 3 with \( a =3 \), \( b =5 \):

Left-hand side (LHS):

\( 3*(3)*(5)^2 -10*(3)*(5) +3 \).

Compute each term:

First term: \( 3*3*25 = 225 \).

Second term: \( -10*3*5 = -150 \).

Third term: \( 3 \).

Total: \( 225 -150 +3 = 78 \).

Which matches the coefficient of \( x \), which is 78. Good.

Now equation 4:

\( (5)^3 -5*(5)^2 +5 -7 = 125 -125 +5 -7 = (125 -125) + (5 -7) = 0 -2 = -2 \).

Which matches the constant term. Perfect.

Therefore, \( g(x) = 3x +5 \).

Wait, so that&#x27;s the answer? Let me double-check by composing \( f(g(x)) \).

Compute \( f(g(x)) = f(3x +5) = (3x +5)^3 -5*(3x +5)^2 + (3x +5) -7 \).

First, compute \( (3x +5)^3 \):

Let me compute step by step:

First, \( (3x +5)^2 = 9x^2 + 30x +25 \).

Then, \( (3x +5)^3 = (3x +5)*(9x^2 +30x +25) \).

Multiply term by term:

3x*(9x^2) = 27x^3

3x*(30x) = 90x^2

3x*(25) = 75x

5*(9x^2) = 45x^2

5*(30x) = 150x

5*(25) = 125

Add them all up:

27x^3 +90x^2 +75x +45x^2 +150x +125 =

27x^3 + (90x^2 +45x^2) + (75x +150x) +125 =

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125.

Now, compute -5*(3x +5)^2:

We already have \( (3x +5)^2 =9x^2 +30x +25 \), so multiply by -5:

-45x^2 -150x -125.

Then, add (3x +5):

3x +5.

Subtract 7:

So total expression:

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125 -45x^2 -150x -125 +3x +5 -7.

Combine like terms:

- \( x^3 \): 27x^3.

- \( x^2 \): 135x^2 -45x^2 = 90x^2.

- \( x \): 225x -150x +3x = 78x.

- Constants: 125 -125 +5 -7 = (-2).

So indeed, we get 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2, which matches the given polynomial. Therefore, \( g(x) =3x +5 \) is correct.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{3x + 5} \).

Substituting \( g(x) = ax + b \) into \( f(x) \), we get:
\[

2. The coefficient of \( x^2 \) gives \( 3a^2b - 5a^2 = 90 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \), we solve \( 27b - 45 = 90 \) to get \( b = 5 \).
3. The coefficient of \( x \) gives \( 3ab^2 - 10ab + a = 78 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 225 - 150 + 3 = 78 \).
4. The constant term gives \( b^3 - 5b^2 + b - 7 = -2 \). Substituting \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 125 - 125 + 5 - 7 = -2 \).

Thus, \( g(x) = 3x + 5 \) satisfies all conditions. Verifying by composing \( f(g(x)) \) confirms the result.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find a function \( g(x) \) such that when I compose \( f \) and \( g \), meaning I plug \( g(x) \) into \( f \), I get \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \). The function \( f(x) \) is given as \( x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \). 

Let me write down what I know:

\( f(g(x)) = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \)

and

\( f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \).

So, substituting \( g(x) \) into \( f \), we have:

\( f(g(x)) = [g(x)]^3 - 5[g(x)]^2 + g(x) - 7 \).

This must equal \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \). Therefore, we need to solve for \( g(x) \) in the equation:

\( [g(x)]^3 - 5[g(x)]^2 + g(x) - 7 = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \).

Hmm, solving for \( g(x) \) here seems a bit complicated because it&#x27;s inside a cubic function. Maybe \( g(x) \) is a linear function? That would make sense because composing linear functions with polynomials can result in polynomials of the same degree. Since \( f(g(x)) \) is a cubic polynomial, and \( f(x) \) is cubic, then \( g(x) \) should be linear, right? Because the composition of two cubic functions would result in a 9th degree polynomial, which is not the case here. Wait, no, actually, if \( f(x) \) is cubic and \( g(x) \) is linear, then \( f(g(x)) \) would be a cubic function. If \( g(x) \) were quadratic, then \( f(g(x)) \) would be a 6th degree polynomial, which is not the case here. So, yes, \( g(x) \) is likely linear.

So let&#x27;s assume \( g(x) = ax + b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants to be determined.

Then, substituting into \( f \):

\( f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7 \).

Let me expand this step by step.

First, compute \( (ax + b)^3 \):

\( (ax + b)^3 = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 \).

Then, compute \( -5(ax + b)^2 \):

First, \( (ax + b)^2 = a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2 \), so multiplied by -5:

\( -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 \).

Then, \( (ax + b) \) is just \( ax + b \), so adding that:

\( ax + b \).

Finally, subtracting 7.

So putting all together:

\( f(g(x)) = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 + ax + b -7 \).

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

- The \( x^3 \) term: \( a^3 \).
- The \( x^2 \) terms: \( 3a^2b -5a^2 \).
- The \( x \) terms: \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a \).
- The constant terms: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 \).

This should equal \( 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2 \). Therefore, we can set up equations for each coefficient:

1. Coefficient of \( x^3 \): \( a^3 = 27 \).
2. Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( 3a^2b -5a^2 = 90 \).
3. Coefficient of \( x \): \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a = 78 \).
4. Constant term: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 = -2 \).

Let&#x27;s solve these equations step by step.

First, equation 1: \( a^3 = 27 \). Therefore, \( a = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \). So \( a = 3 \).

Now plug \( a = 3 \) into equation 2:

\( 3*(3)^2*b -5*(3)^2 = 90 \).

Compute that:

\( 3*9*b -5*9 = 90 \).

Simplify:

\( 27b -45 = 90 \).

Add 45 to both sides:

\( 27b = 135 \).

Divide by 27:

\( b = 5 \).

So now, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 5 \). Let&#x27;s check if this works with equation 3 and 4.

First, equation 3 with \( a =3 \), \( b =5 \):

Left-hand side (LHS):

\( 3*(3)*(5)^2 -10*(3)*(5) +3 \).

Compute each term:

First term: \( 3*3*25 = 225 \).

Second term: \( -10*3*5 = -150 \).

Third term: \( 3 \).

Total: \( 225 -150 +3 = 78 \).

Which matches the coefficient of \( x \), which is 78. Good.

Now equation 4:

\( (5)^3 -5*(5)^2 +5 -7 = 125 -125 +5 -7 = (125 -125) + (5 -7) = 0 -2 = -2 \).

Which matches the constant term. Perfect.

Therefore, \( g(x) = 3x +5 \).

Wait, so that&#x27;s the answer? Let me double-check by composing \( f(g(x)) \).

Compute \( f(g(x)) = f(3x +5) = (3x +5)^3 -5*(3x +5)^2 + (3x +5) -7 \).

First, compute \( (3x +5)^3 \):

Let me compute step by step:

First, \( (3x +5)^2 = 9x^2 + 30x +25 \).

Then, \( (3x +5)^3 = (3x +5)*(9x^2 +30x +25) \).

Multiply term by term:

3x*(9x^2) = 27x^3

3x*(30x) = 90x^2

3x*(25) = 75x

5*(9x^2) = 45x^2

5*(30x) = 150x

5*(25) = 125

Add them all up:

27x^3 +90x^2 +75x +45x^2 +150x +125 =

27x^3 + (90x^2 +45x^2) + (75x +150x) +125 =

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125.

Now, compute -5*(3x +5)^2:

We already have \( (3x +5)^2 =9x^2 +30x +25 \), so multiply by -5:

-45x^2 -150x -125.

Then, add (3x +5):

3x +5.

Subtract 7:

So total expression:

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125 -45x^2 -150x -125 +3x +5 -7.

Combine like terms:

- \( x^3 \): 27x^3.

- \( x^2 \): 135x^2 -45x^2 = 90x^2.

- \( x \): 225x -150x +3x = 78x.

- Constants: 125 -125 +5 -7 = (-2).

So indeed, we get 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2, which matches the given polynomial. Therefore, \( g(x) =3x +5 \) is correct.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{3x + 5} \).

**Final Answer**
The function \( g(x) \) is \boxed{3x + 5}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the function \( g(x) \) such that \( f(g(x)) = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \), where \( f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \), we assume \( g(x) \) is a linear function of the form \( g(x) = ax + b \).

Substituting \( g(x) = ax + b \) into \( f(x) \), we get:
\[
f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7
\]

Expanding and combining like terms, we match the coefficients with \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \):

1. The coefficient of \( x^3 \) gives \( a^3 = 27 \), so \( a = 3 \).
2. The coefficient of \( x^2 \) gives \( 3a^2b - 5a^2 = 90 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \), we solve \( 27b - 45 = 90 \) to get \( b = 5 \).
3. The coefficient of \( x \) gives \( 3ab^2 - 10ab + a = 78 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 225 - 150 + 3 = 78 \).
4. The constant term gives \( b^3 - 5b^2 + b - 7 = -2 \). Substituting \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 125 - 125 + 5 - 7 = -2 \).

Thus, \( g(x) = 3x + 5 \) satisfies all conditions. Verifying by composing \( f(g(x)) \) confirms the result.

The function \( g(x) \) is \(\boxed{3x + 5}\).          </p>

\( f(g(x)) = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \)

\( f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \).

So, substituting \( g(x) \) into \( f \), we have:

\( f(g(x)) = [g(x)]^3 - 5[g(x)]^2 + g(x) - 7 \).

This must equal \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \). Therefore, we need to solve for \( g(x) \) in the equation:

\( [g(x)]^3 - 5[g(x)]^2 + g(x) - 7 = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \).

So let&#x27;s assume \( g(x) = ax + b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants to be determined.

Then, substituting into \( f \):

\( f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7 \).

Let me expand this step by step.

First, compute \( (ax + b)^3 \):

\( (ax + b)^3 = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 \).

Then, compute \( -5(ax + b)^2 \):

First, \( (ax + b)^2 = a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2 \), so multiplied by -5:

\( -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 \).

Then, \( (ax + b) \) is just \( ax + b \), so adding that:

\( ax + b \).

Finally, subtracting 7.

So putting all together:

\( f(g(x)) = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 + ax + b -7 \).

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

- The \( x^3 \) term: \( a^3 \).
- The \( x^2 \) terms: \( 3a^2b -5a^2 \).
- The \( x \) terms: \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a \).
- The constant terms: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 \).

This should equal \( 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2 \). Therefore, we can set up equations for each coefficient:

1. Coefficient of \( x^3 \): \( a^3 = 27 \).
2. Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( 3a^2b -5a^2 = 90 \).
3. Coefficient of \( x \): \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a = 78 \).
4. Constant term: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 = -2 \).

Let&#x27;s solve these equations step by step.

First, equation 1: \( a^3 = 27 \). Therefore, \( a = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \). So \( a = 3 \).

Now plug \( a = 3 \) into equation 2:

\( 3*(3)^2*b -5*(3)^2 = 90 \).

Compute that:

\( 3*9*b -5*9 = 90 \).

Simplify:

\( 27b -45 = 90 \).

Add 45 to both sides:

\( 27b = 135 \).

Divide by 27:

\( b = 5 \).

So now, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 5 \). Let&#x27;s check if this works with equation 3 and 4.

First, equation 3 with \( a =3 \), \( b =5 \):

Left-hand side (LHS):

\( 3*(3)*(5)^2 -10*(3)*(5) +3 \).

Compute each term:

First term: \( 3*3*25 = 225 \).

Second term: \( -10*3*5 = -150 \).

Third term: \( 3 \).

Total: \( 225 -150 +3 = 78 \).

Which matches the coefficient of \( x \), which is 78. Good.

Now equation 4:

\( (5)^3 -5*(5)^2 +5 -7 = 125 -125 +5 -7 = (125 -125) + (5 -7) = 0 -2 = -2 \).

Which matches the constant term. Perfect.

Therefore, \( g(x) = 3x +5 \).

Wait, so that&#x27;s the answer? Let me double-check by composing \( f(g(x)) \).

Compute \( f(g(x)) = f(3x +5) = (3x +5)^3 -5*(3x +5)^2 + (3x +5) -7 \).

First, compute \( (3x +5)^3 \):

Let me compute step by step:

First, \( (3x +5)^2 = 9x^2 + 30x +25 \).

Then, \( (3x +5)^3 = (3x +5)*(9x^2 +30x +25) \).

Multiply term by term:

3x*(9x^2) = 27x^3

3x*(30x) = 90x^2

3x*(25) = 75x

5*(9x^2) = 45x^2

5*(30x) = 150x

5*(25) = 125

Add them all up:

27x^3 +90x^2 +75x +45x^2 +150x +125 =

27x^3 + (90x^2 +45x^2) + (75x +150x) +125 =

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125.

Now, compute -5*(3x +5)^2:

We already have \( (3x +5)^2 =9x^2 +30x +25 \), so multiply by -5:

-45x^2 -150x -125.

Then, add (3x +5):

3x +5.

Subtract 7:

So total expression:

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125 -45x^2 -150x -125 +3x +5 -7.

Combine like terms:

- \( x^3 \): 27x^3.

- \( x^2 \): 135x^2 -45x^2 = 90x^2.

- \( x \): 225x -150x +3x = 78x.

- Constants: 125 -125 +5 -7 = (-2).

So indeed, we get 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2, which matches the given polynomial. Therefore, \( g(x) =3x +5 \) is correct.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{3x + 5} \).

**Final Answer**
The function \( g(x) \) is \boxed{3x + 5}.
&lt;/think&gt;

Substituting \( g(x) = ax + b \) into \( f(x) \), we get:
\[
f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7
\]

Expanding and combining like terms, we match the coefficients with \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \):

1. The coefficient of \( x^3 \) gives \( a^3 = 27 \), so \( a = 3 \).
2. The coefficient of \( x^2 \) gives \( 3a^2b - 5a^2 = 90 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \), we solve \( 27b - 45 = 90 \) to get \( b = 5 \).
3. The coefficient of \( x \) gives \( 3ab^2 - 10ab + a = 78 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 225 - 150 + 3 = 78 \).
4. The constant term gives \( b^3 - 5b^2 + b - 7 = -2 \). Substituting \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 125 - 125 + 5 - 7 = -2 \).

Thus, \( g(x) = 3x + 5 \) satisfies all conditions. Verifying by composing \( f(g(x)) \) confirms the result.

Then, substituting into \( f \):

\( f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7 \).

Let me expand this step by step.

First, compute \( (ax + b)^3 \):

\( (ax + b)^3 = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 \).

Then, compute \( -5(ax + b)^2 \):

First, \( (ax + b)^2 = a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2 \), so multiplied by -5:

\( -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 \).

Then, \( (ax + b) \) is just \( ax + b \), so adding that:

\( ax + b \).

Finally, subtracting 7.

So putting all together:

\( f(g(x)) = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 + ax + b -7 \).

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

- The \( x^3 \) term: \( a^3 \).
- The \( x^2 \) terms: \( 3a^2b -5a^2 \).
- The \( x \) terms: \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a \).

4. Constant term: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 = -2 \).

Let&#x27;s solve these equations step by step.

First, equation 1: \( a^3 = 27 \). Therefore, \( a = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \). So \( a = 3 \).

Now plug \( a = 3 \) into equation 2:

\( 3*(3)^2*b -5*(3)^2 = 90 \).

Compute that:

\( 3*9*b -5*9 = 90 \).

Simplify:

\( 27b -45 = 90 \).

Add 45 to both sides:

\( 27b = 135 \).

Divide by 27:

\( b = 5 \).

So now, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 5 \). Let&#x27;s check if this works with equation 3 and 4.

First, equation 3 with \( a =3 \), \( b =5 \):

Left-hand side (LHS):

\( 3*(3)*(5)^2 -10*(3)*(5) +3 \).

Compute each term:

First term: \( 3*3*25 = 225 \).

Total: \( 225 -150 +3 = 78 \).

Which matches the coefficient of \( x \), which is 78. Good.

Now equation 4:

\( (5)^3 -5*(5)^2 +5 -7 = 125 -125 +5 -7 = (125 -125) + (5 -7) = 0 -2 = -2 \).

Which matches the constant term. Perfect.

Therefore, \( g(x) = 3x +5 \).

Wait, so that&#x27;s the answer? Let me double-check by composing \( f(g(x)) \).

Compute \( f(g(x)) = f(3x +5) = (3x +5)^3 -5*(3x +5)^2 + (3x +5) -7 \).

First, compute \( (3x +5)^3 \):

Let me compute step by step:

First, \( (3x +5)^2 = 9x^2 + 30x +25 \).

Then, \( (3x +5)^3 = (3x +5)*(9x^2 +30x +25) \).

Multiply term by term:

3x*(9x^2) = 27x^3

3x*(25) = 75x

5*(9x^2) = 45x^2

5*(30x) = 150x

5*(25) = 125

Add them all up:

27x^3 +90x^2 +75x +45x^2 +150x +125 =

27x^3 + (90x^2 +45x^2) + (75x +150x) +125 =

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125.

Now, compute -5*(3x +5)^2:

We already have \( (3x +5)^2 =9x^2 +30x +25 \), so multiply by -5:

-45x^2 -150x -125.

Then, add (3x +5):

3x +5.

Subtract 7:

So total expression:

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125 -45x^2 -150x -125 +3x +5 -7.

Combine like terms:

- \( x^3 \): 27x^3.

- \( x^2 \): 135x^2 -45x^2 = 90x^2.

- \( x \): 225x -150x +3x = 78x.

- Constants: 125 -125 +5 -7 = (-2).

So indeed, we get 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2, which matches the given polynomial. Therefore, \( g(x) =3x +5 \) is correct.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{3x + 5} \).

**Final Answer**
The function \( g(x) \) is \boxed{3x + 5}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the function \( g(x) \) such that \( f(g(x)) = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \), where \( f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \), we assume \( g(x) \) is a linear function of the form \( g(x) = ax + b \).

Substituting \( g(x) = ax + b \) into \( f(x) \), we get:
\[
f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7
\]

Expanding and combining like terms, we match the coefficients with \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \):

1. The coefficient of \( x^3 \) gives \( a^3 = 27 \), so \( a = 3 \).
2. The coefficient of \( x^2 \) gives \( 3a^2b - 5a^2 = 90 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \), we solve \( 27b - 45 = 90 \) to get \( b = 5 \).
3. The coefficient of \( x \) gives \( 3ab^2 - 10ab + a = 78 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 225 - 150 + 3 = 78 \).
4. The constant term gives \( b^3 - 5b^2 + b - 7 = -2 \). Substituting \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 125 - 125 + 5 - 7 = -2 \).

Thus, \( g(x) = 3x + 5 \) satisfies all conditions. Verifying by composing \( f(g(x)) \) confirms the result.

The function \( g(x) \) is \(\boxed{3x + 5}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find a function \( g(x) \) such that when I compose \( f \) and \( g \), meaning I plug \( g(x) \) into \( f \), I get \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \). The function \( f(x) \) is given as \( x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \). 

Let me write down what I know:

\( f(g(x)) = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \)

and

\( f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \).

So, substituting \( g(x) \) into \( f \), we have:

\( f(g(x)) = [g(x)]^3 - 5[g(x)]^2 + g(x) - 7 \).

This must equal \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \). Therefore, we need to solve for \( g(x) \) in the equation:

\( [g(x)]^3 - 5[g(x)]^2 + g(x) - 7 = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \).

Hmm, solving for \( g(x) \) here seems a bit complicated because it&#x27;s inside a cubic function. Maybe \( g(x) \) is a linear function? That would make sense because composing linear functions with polynomials can result in polynomials of the same degree. Since \( f(g(x)) \) is a cubic polynomial, and \( f(x) \) is cubic, then \( g(x) \) should be linear, right? Because the composition of two cubic functions would result in a 9th degree polynomial, which is not the case here. Wait, no, actually, if \( f(x) \) is cubic and \( g(x) \) is linear, then \( f(g(x)) \) would be a cubic function. If \( g(x) \) were quadratic, then \( f(g(x)) \) would be a 6th degree polynomial, which is not the case here. So, yes, \( g(x) \) is likely linear.

So let&#x27;s assume \( g(x) = ax + b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants to be determined.

Then, substituting into \( f \):

\( f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7 \).

Let me expand this step by step.

First, compute \( (ax + b)^3 \):

\( (ax + b)^3 = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 \).

Then, compute \( -5(ax + b)^2 \):

First, \( (ax + b)^2 = a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2 \), so multiplied by -5:

\( -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 \).

Then, \( (ax + b) \) is just \( ax + b \), so adding that:

\( ax + b \).

Finally, subtracting 7.

So putting all together:

\( f(g(x)) = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 + ax + b -7 \).

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

- The \( x^3 \) term: \( a^3 \).
- The \( x^2 \) terms: \( 3a^2b -5a^2 \).
- The \( x \) terms: \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a \).
- The constant terms: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 \).

This should equal \( 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2 \). Therefore, we can set up equations for each coefficient:

1. Coefficient of \( x^3 \): \( a^3 = 27 \).
2. Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( 3a^2b -5a^2 = 90 \).
3. Coefficient of \( x \): \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a = 78 \).
4. Constant term: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 = -2 \).

Let&#x27;s solve these equations step by step.

First, equation 1: \( a^3 = 27 \). Therefore, \( a = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \). So \( a = 3 \).

Now plug \( a = 3 \) into equation 2:

\( 3*(3)^2*b -5*(3)^2 = 90 \).

Compute that:

\( 3*9*b -5*9 = 90 \).

Simplify:

\( 27b -45 = 90 \).

Add 45 to both sides:

\( 27b = 135 \).

Divide by 27:

\( b = 5 \).

So now, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 5 \). Let&#x27;s check if this works with equation 3 and 4.

First, equation 3 with \( a =3 \), \( b =5 \):

Left-hand side (LHS):

\( 3*(3)*(5)^2 -10*(3)*(5) +3 \).

Compute each term:

First term: \( 3*3*25 = 225 \).

Second term: \( -10*3*5 = -150 \).

Third term: \( 3 \).

Total: \( 225 -150 +3 = 78 \).

Which matches the coefficient of \( x \), which is 78. Good.

Now equation 4:

\( (5)^3 -5*(5)^2 +5 -7 = 125 -125 +5 -7 = (125 -125) + (5 -7) = 0 -2 = -2 \).

Which matches the constant term. Perfect.

Therefore, \( g(x) = 3x +5 \).

Wait, so that&#x27;s the answer? Let me double-check by composing \( f(g(x)) \).

Compute \( f(g(x)) = f(3x +5) = (3x +5)^3 -5*(3x +5)^2 + (3x +5) -7 \).

First, compute \( (3x +5)^3 \):

Let me compute step by step:

First, \( (3x +5)^2 = 9x^2 + 30x +25 \).

Then, \( (3x +5)^3 = (3x +5)*(9x^2 +30x +25) \).

Multiply term by term:

3x*(9x^2) = 27x^3

3x*(30x) = 90x^2

3x*(25) = 75x

5*(9x^2) = 45x^2

5*(30x) = 150x

5*(25) = 125

Add them all up:

27x^3 +90x^2 +75x +45x^2 +150x +125 =

27x^3 + (90x^2 +45x^2) + (75x +150x) +125 =

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125.

Now, compute -5*(3x +5)^2:

We already have \( (3x +5)^2 =9x^2 +30x +25 \), so multiply by -5:

-45x^2 -150x -125.

Then, add (3x +5):

3x +5.

Subtract 7:

So total expression:

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125 -45x^2 -150x -125 +3x +5 -7.

Combine like terms:

- \( x^3 \): 27x^3.

- \( x^2 \): 135x^2 -45x^2 = 90x^2.

- \( x \): 225x -150x +3x = 78x.

- Constants: 125 -125 +5 -7 = (-2).

So indeed, we get 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2, which matches the given polynomial. Therefore, \( g(x) =3x +5 \) is correct.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{3x + 5} \).

**Final Answer**
The function \( g(x) \) is \boxed{3x + 5}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the function \( g(x) \) such that \( f(g(x)) = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \), where \( f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \), we assume \( g(x) \) is a linear function of the form \( g(x) = ax + b \).

Substituting \( g(x) = ax + b \) into \( f(x) \), we get:
\[
f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7
\]

Expanding and combining like terms, we match the coefficients with \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \):

1. The coefficient of \( x^3 \) gives \( a^3 = 27 \), so \( a = 3 \).
2. The coefficient of \( x^2 \) gives \( 3a^2b - 5a^2 = 90 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \), we solve \( 27b - 45 = 90 \) to get \( b = 5 \).
3. The coefficient of \( x \) gives \( 3ab^2 - 10ab + a = 78 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 225 - 150 + 3 = 78 \).
4. The constant term gives \( b^3 - 5b^2 + b - 7 = -2 \). Substituting \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 125 - 125 + 5 - 7 = -2 \).

Thus, \( g(x) = 3x + 5 \) satisfies all conditions. Verifying by composing \( f(g(x)) \) confirms the result.

Then, substituting into \( f \):

\( f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7 \).

Let me expand this step by step.

First, compute \( (ax + b)^3 \):

\( (ax + b)^3 = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 \).

Then, compute \( -5(ax + b)^2 \):

First, \( (ax + b)^2 = a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2 \), so multiplied by -5:

\( -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 \).

Then, \( (ax + b) \) is just \( ax + b \), so adding that:

\( ax + b \).

Finally, subtracting 7.

So putting all together:

\( f(g(x)) = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 + ax + b -7 \).

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

- The \( x^3 \) term: \( a^3 \).
- The \( x^2 \) terms: \( 3a^2b -5a^2 \).
- The \( x \) terms: \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a \).
- The constant terms: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 \).

This should equal \( 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2 \). Therefore, we can set up equations for each coefficient:

1. Coefficient of \( x^3 \): \( a^3 = 27 \).
2. Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( 3a^2b -5a^2 = 90 \).
3. Coefficient of \( x \): \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a = 78 \).
4. Constant term: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 = -2 \).

Let&#x27;s solve these equations step by step.

First, equation 1: \( a^3 = 27 \). Therefore, \( a = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \). So \( a = 3 \).

Now plug \( a = 3 \) into equation 2:

\( 3*(3)^2*b -5*(3)^2 = 90 \).

Compute that:

\( 3*9*b -5*9 = 90 \).

Simplify:

\( 27b -45 = 90 \).

Add 45 to both sides:

\( 27b = 135 \).

Divide by 27:

\( b = 5 \).

So now, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 5 \). Let&#x27;s check if this works with equation 3 and 4.

First, equation 3 with \( a =3 \), \( b =5 \):

Left-hand side (LHS):

\( 3*(3)*(5)^2 -10*(3)*(5) +3 \).

Compute each term:

First term: \( 3*3*25 = 225 \).

Second term: \( -10*3*5 = -150 \).

Third term: \( 3 \).

Total: \( 225 -150 +3 = 78 \).

Which matches the coefficient of \( x \), which is 78. Good.

Now equation 4:

\( (5)^3 -5*(5)^2 +5 -7 = 125 -125 +5 -7 = (125 -125) + (5 -7) = 0 -2 = -2 \).

Which matches the constant term. Perfect.

Therefore, \( g(x) = 3x +5 \).

Wait, so that&#x27;s the answer? Let me double-check by composing \( f(g(x)) \).

Compute \( f(g(x)) = f(3x +5) = (3x +5)^3 -5*(3x +5)^2 + (3x +5) -7 \).

First, compute \( (3x +5)^3 \):

Let me compute step by step:

First, \( (3x +5)^2 = 9x^2 + 30x +25 \).

Then, \( (3x +5)^3 = (3x +5)*(9x^2 +30x +25) \).

Multiply term by term:

3x*(9x^2) = 27x^3

3x*(30x) = 90x^2

3x*(25) = 75x

5*(9x^2) = 45x^2

5*(30x) = 150x

5*(25) = 125

Add them all up:

27x^3 +90x^2 +75x +45x^2 +150x +125 =

27x^3 + (90x^2 +45x^2) + (75x +150x) +125 =

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125.

Now, compute -5*(3x +5)^2:

We already have \( (3x +5)^2 =9x^2 +30x +25 \), so multiply by -5:

-45x^2 -150x -125.

Then, add (3x +5):

3x +5.

Subtract 7:

So total expression:

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125 -45x^2 -150x -125 +3x +5 -7.

Combine like terms:

- \( x^3 \): 27x^3.

- \( x^2 \): 135x^2 -45x^2 = 90x^2.

- \( x \): 225x -150x +3x = 78x.

- Constants: 125 -125 +5 -7 = (-2).

So indeed, we get 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2, which matches the given polynomial. Therefore, \( g(x) =3x +5 \) is correct.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{3x + 5} \).

**Final Answer**

Substituting \( g(x) = ax + b \) into \( f(x) \), we get:

2. The coefficient of \( x^2 \) gives \( 3a^2b - 5a^2 = 90 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \), we solve \( 27b - 45 = 90 \) to get \( b = 5 \).
3. The coefficient of \( x \) gives \( 3ab^2 - 10ab + a = 78 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 225 - 150 + 3 = 78 \).
4. The constant term gives \( b^3 - 5b^2 + b - 7 = -2 \). Substituting \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 125 - 125 + 5 - 7 = -2 \).

\( f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7 \).

Let me expand this step by step.

First, compute \( (ax + b)^3 \):

\( (ax + b)^3 = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 \).

Then, compute \( -5(ax + b)^2 \):

First, \( (ax + b)^2 = a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2 \), so multiplied by -5:

\( -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 \).

Then, \( (ax + b) \) is just \( ax + b \), so adding that:

\( ax + b \).

Finally, subtracting 7.

So putting all together:

\( f(g(x)) = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 + ax + b -7 \).

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

- The \( x^3 \) term: \( a^3 \).
- The \( x^2 \) terms: \( 3a^2b -5a^2 \).
- The \( x \) terms: \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a \).
- The constant terms: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 \).

This should equal \( 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2 \). Therefore, we can set up equations for each coefficient:

1. Coefficient of \( x^3 \): \( a^3 = 27 \).
2. Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( 3a^2b -5a^2 = 90 \).
3. Coefficient of \( x \): \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a = 78 \).
4. Constant term: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 = -2 \).

Let&#x27;s solve these equations step by step.

First, equation 1: \( a^3 = 27 \). Therefore, \( a = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \). So \( a = 3 \).

Now plug \( a = 3 \) into equation 2:

\( 3*(3)^2*b -5*(3)^2 = 90 \).

Compute that:

\( 3*9*b -5*9 = 90 \).

Simplify:

\( 27b -45 = 90 \).

Add 45 to both sides:

\( 27b = 135 \).

Divide by 27:

\( b = 5 \).

So now, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 5 \). Let&#x27;s check if this works with equation 3 and 4.

First, equation 3 with \( a =3 \), \( b =5 \):

Left-hand side (LHS):

\( 3*(3)*(5)^2 -10*(3)*(5) +3 \).

Compute each term:

First term: \( 3*3*25 = 225 \).

Second term: \( -10*3*5 = -150 \).

Third term: \( 3 \).

Total: \( 225 -150 +3 = 78 \).

Which matches the coefficient of \( x \), which is 78. Good.

Now equation 4:

\( (5)^3 -5*(5)^2 +5 -7 = 125 -125 +5 -7 = (125 -125) + (5 -7) = 0 -2 = -2 \).

Which matches the constant term. Perfect.

Therefore, \( g(x) = 3x +5 \).

Wait, so that&#x27;s the answer? Let me double-check by composing \( f(g(x)) \).

Compute \( f(g(x)) = f(3x +5) = (3x +5)^3 -5*(3x +5)^2 + (3x +5) -7 \).

First, compute \( (3x +5)^3 \):

Let me compute step by step:

First, \( (3x +5)^2 = 9x^2 + 30x +25 \).

Then, \( (3x +5)^3 = (3x +5)*(9x^2 +30x +25) \).

Multiply term by term:

3x*(9x^2) = 27x^3

3x*(30x) = 90x^2

3x*(25) = 75x

5*(9x^2) = 45x^2

5*(30x) = 150x

5*(25) = 125

Add them all up:

27x^3 +90x^2 +75x +45x^2 +150x +125 =

27x^3 + (90x^2 +45x^2) + (75x +150x) +125 =

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125.

Now, compute -5*(3x +5)^2:

We already have \( (3x +5)^2 =9x^2 +30x +25 \), so multiply by -5:

-45x^2 -150x -125.

Then, add (3x +5):

3x +5.

Subtract 7:

So total expression:

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125 -45x^2 -150x -125 +3x +5 -7.

Combine like terms:

- \( x^3 \): 27x^3.

- \( x^2 \): 135x^2 -45x^2 = 90x^2.

- \( x \): 225x -150x +3x = 78x.

- Constants: 125 -125 +5 -7 = (-2).

So indeed, we get 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2, which matches the given polynomial. Therefore, \( g(x) =3x +5 \) is correct.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{3x + 5} \).

**Final Answer**
The function \( g(x) \) is \boxed{3x + 5}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the function \( g(x) \) such that \( f(g(x)) = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \), where \( f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \), we assume \( g(x) \) is a linear function of the form \( g(x) = ax + b \).

Substituting \( g(x) = ax + b \) into \( f(x) \), we get:
\[
f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7
\]

Expanding and combining like terms, we match the coefficients with \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \):

1. The coefficient of \( x^3 \) gives \( a^3 = 27 \), so \( a = 3 \).
2. The coefficient of \( x^2 \) gives \( 3a^2b - 5a^2 = 90 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \), we solve \( 27b - 45 = 90 \) to get \( b = 5 \).
3. The coefficient of \( x \) gives \( 3ab^2 - 10ab + a = 78 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 225 - 150 + 3 = 78 \).
4. The constant term gives \( b^3 - 5b^2 + b - 7 = -2 \). Substituting \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 125 - 125 + 5 - 7 = -2 \).

Thus, \( g(x) = 3x + 5 \) satisfies all conditions. Verifying by composing \( f(g(x)) \) confirms the result.

The function \( g(x) \) is \(\boxed{3x + 5}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find a function \( g(x) \) such that when I compose \( f \) and \( g \), meaning I plug \( g(x) \) into \( f \), I get \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \). The function \( f(x) \) is given as \( x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \). 

Let me write down what I know:

\( f(g(x)) = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \)

and

\( f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \).

So, substituting \( g(x) \) into \( f \), we have:

\( f(g(x)) = [g(x)]^3 - 5[g(x)]^2 + g(x) - 7 \).

This must equal \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \). Therefore, we need to solve for \( g(x) \) in the equation:

\( [g(x)]^3 - 5[g(x)]^2 + g(x) - 7 = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \).

Hmm, solving for \( g(x) \) here seems a bit complicated because it&#x27;s inside a cubic function. Maybe \( g(x) \) is a linear function? That would make sense because composing linear functions with polynomials can result in polynomials of the same degree. Since \( f(g(x)) \) is a cubic polynomial, and \( f(x) \) is cubic, then \( g(x) \) should be linear, right? Because the composition of two cubic functions would result in a 9th degree polynomial, which is not the case here. Wait, no, actually, if \( f(x) \) is cubic and \( g(x) \) is linear, then \( f(g(x)) \) would be a cubic function. If \( g(x) \) were quadratic, then \( f(g(x)) \) would be a 6th degree polynomial, which is not the case here. So, yes, \( g(x) \) is likely linear.

So let&#x27;s assume \( g(x) = ax + b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants to be determined.

Then, substituting into \( f \):

\( f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7 \).

Let me expand this step by step.

First, compute \( (ax + b)^3 \):

\( (ax + b)^3 = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 \).

Then, compute \( -5(ax + b)^2 \):

First, \( (ax + b)^2 = a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2 \), so multiplied by -5:

\( -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 \).

Then, \( (ax + b) \) is just \( ax + b \), so adding that:

\( ax + b \).

Finally, subtracting 7.

So putting all together:

\( f(g(x)) = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 + ax + b -7 \).

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

- The \( x^3 \) term: \( a^3 \).
- The \( x^2 \) terms: \( 3a^2b -5a^2 \).
- The \( x \) terms: \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a \).
- The constant terms: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 \).

This should equal \( 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2 \). Therefore, we can set up equations for each coefficient:

1. Coefficient of \( x^3 \): \( a^3 = 27 \).
2. Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( 3a^2b -5a^2 = 90 \).
3. Coefficient of \( x \): \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a = 78 \).
4. Constant term: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 = -2 \).

Let&#x27;s solve these equations step by step.

First, equation 1: \( a^3 = 27 \). Therefore, \( a = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \). So \( a = 3 \).

Now plug \( a = 3 \) into equation 2:

\( 3*(3)^2*b -5*(3)^2 = 90 \).

Compute that:

\( 3*9*b -5*9 = 90 \).

Simplify:

\( 27b -45 = 90 \).

Add 45 to both sides:

\( 27b = 135 \).

Divide by 27:

\( b = 5 \).

So now, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 5 \). Let&#x27;s check if this works with equation 3 and 4.

First, equation 3 with \( a =3 \), \( b =5 \):

Left-hand side (LHS):

\( 3*(3)*(5)^2 -10*(3)*(5) +3 \).

Compute each term:

First term: \( 3*3*25 = 225 \).

Second term: \( -10*3*5 = -150 \).

Third term: \( 3 \).

Total: \( 225 -150 +3 = 78 \).

Which matches the coefficient of \( x \), which is 78. Good.

Now equation 4:

\( (5)^3 -5*(5)^2 +5 -7 = 125 -125 +5 -7 = (125 -125) + (5 -7) = 0 -2 = -2 \).

Which matches the constant term. Perfect.

Therefore, \( g(x) = 3x +5 \).

Wait, so that&#x27;s the answer? Let me double-check by composing \( f(g(x)) \).

Compute \( f(g(x)) = f(3x +5) = (3x +5)^3 -5*(3x +5)^2 + (3x +5) -7 \).

First, compute \( (3x +5)^3 \):

Let me compute step by step:

First, \( (3x +5)^2 = 9x^2 + 30x +25 \).

Then, \( (3x +5)^3 = (3x +5)*(9x^2 +30x +25) \).

Multiply term by term:

3x*(9x^2) = 27x^3

3x*(30x) = 90x^2

3x*(25) = 75x

5*(9x^2) = 45x^2

5*(30x) = 150x

5*(25) = 125

Add them all up:

27x^3 +90x^2 +75x +45x^2 +150x +125 =

27x^3 + (90x^2 +45x^2) + (75x +150x) +125 =

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125.

Now, compute -5*(3x +5)^2:

We already have \( (3x +5)^2 =9x^2 +30x +25 \), so multiply by -5:

-45x^2 -150x -125.

Then, add (3x +5):

3x +5.

Subtract 7:

So total expression:

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125 -45x^2 -150x -125 +3x +5 -7.

Combine like terms:

- \( x^3 \): 27x^3.

- \( x^2 \): 135x^2 -45x^2 = 90x^2.

- \( x \): 225x -150x +3x = 78x.

- Constants: 125 -125 +5 -7 = (-2).

So indeed, we get 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2, which matches the given polynomial. Therefore, \( g(x) =3x +5 \) is correct.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{3x + 5} \).

**Final Answer**
The function \( g(x) \) is \boxed{3x + 5}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the function \( g(x) \) such that \( f(g(x)) = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \), where \( f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \), we assume \( g(x) \) is a linear function of the form \( g(x) = ax + b \).

Substituting \( g(x) = ax + b \) into \( f(x) \), we get:
\[
f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7
\]

Expanding and combining like terms, we match the coefficients with \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \):

1. The coefficient of \( x^3 \) gives \( a^3 = 27 \), so \( a = 3 \).
2. The coefficient of \( x^2 \) gives \( 3a^2b - 5a^2 = 90 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \), we solve \( 27b - 45 = 90 \) to get \( b = 5 \).
3. The coefficient of \( x \) gives \( 3ab^2 - 10ab + a = 78 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 225 - 150 + 3 = 78 \).
4. The constant term gives \( b^3 - 5b^2 + b - 7 = -2 \). Substituting \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 125 - 125 + 5 - 7 = -2 \).

Thus, \( g(x) = 3x + 5 \) satisfies all conditions. Verifying by composing \( f(g(x)) \) confirms the result.

Then, substituting into \( f \):

\( f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7 \).

Let me expand this step by step.

First, compute \( (ax + b)^3 \):

\( (ax + b)^3 = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 \).

Then, compute \( -5(ax + b)^2 \):

First, \( (ax + b)^2 = a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2 \), so multiplied by -5:

\( -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 \).

Then, \( (ax + b) \) is just \( ax + b \), so adding that:

\( ax + b \).

Finally, subtracting 7.

So putting all together:

\( f(g(x)) = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 + ax + b -7 \).

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

- The \( x^3 \) term: \( a^3 \).
- The \( x^2 \) terms: \( 3a^2b -5a^2 \).
- The \( x \) terms: \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a \).
- The constant terms: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 \).

This should equal \( 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2 \). Therefore, we can set up equations for each coefficient:

2. Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( 3a^2b -5a^2 = 90 \).

4. Constant term: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 = -2 \).

Let&#x27;s solve these equations step by step.

First, equation 1: \( a^3 = 27 \). Therefore, \( a = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \). So \( a = 3 \).

Now plug \( a = 3 \) into equation 2:

\( 3*(3)^2*b -5*(3)^2 = 90 \).

Compute that:

\( 3*9*b -5*9 = 90 \).

Simplify:

\( 27b -45 = 90 \).

Add 45 to both sides:

\( 27b = 135 \).

Divide by 27:

\( b = 5 \).

So now, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 5 \). Let&#x27;s check if this works with equation 3 and 4.

First, equation 3 with \( a =3 \), \( b =5 \):

Left-hand side (LHS):

\( 3*(3)*(5)^2 -10*(3)*(5) +3 \).

Compute each term:

First term: \( 3*3*25 = 225 \).

Third term: \( 3 \).

Total: \( 225 -150 +3 = 78 \).

Which matches the coefficient of \( x \), which is 78. Good.

Now equation 4:

\( (5)^3 -5*(5)^2 +5 -7 = 125 -125 +5 -7 = (125 -125) + (5 -7) = 0 -2 = -2 \).

Which matches the constant term. Perfect.

Therefore, \( g(x) = 3x +5 \).

Wait, so that&#x27;s the answer? Let me double-check by composing \( f(g(x)) \).

Compute \( f(g(x)) = f(3x +5) = (3x +5)^3 -5*(3x +5)^2 + (3x +5) -7 \).

First, compute \( (3x +5)^3 \):

Let me compute step by step:

First, \( (3x +5)^2 = 9x^2 + 30x +25 \).

Then, \( (3x +5)^3 = (3x +5)*(9x^2 +30x +25) \).

Multiply term by term:

3x*(9x^2) = 27x^3

3x*(30x) = 90x^2

3x*(25) = 75x

5*(9x^2) = 45x^2

5*(30x) = 150x

5*(25) = 125

Add them all up:

27x^3 +90x^2 +75x +45x^2 +150x +125 =

27x^3 + (90x^2 +45x^2) + (75x +150x) +125 =

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125.

Now, compute -5*(3x +5)^2:

We already have \( (3x +5)^2 =9x^2 +30x +25 \), so multiply by -5:

-45x^2 -150x -125.

Then, add (3x +5):

3x +5.

Subtract 7:

So total expression:

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125 -45x^2 -150x -125 +3x +5 -7.

Combine like terms:

- \( x^3 \): 27x^3.

- \( x^2 \): 135x^2 -45x^2 = 90x^2.

- \( x \): 225x -150x +3x = 78x.

- Constants: 125 -125 +5 -7 = (-2).

So indeed, we get 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2, which matches the given polynomial. Therefore, \( g(x) =3x +5 \) is correct.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{3x + 5} \).

**Final Answer**
The function \( g(x) \) is \boxed{3x + 5}.

To find the function \( g(x) \) such that \( f(g(x)) = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \), where \( f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \), we assume \( g(x) \) is a linear function of the form \( g(x) = ax + b \).

Substituting \( g(x) = ax + b \) into \( f(x) \), we get:
\[
f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7

Expanding and combining like terms, we match the coefficients with \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \):

1. The coefficient of \( x^3 \) gives \( a^3 = 27 \), so \( a = 3 \).
2. The coefficient of \( x^2 \) gives \( 3a^2b - 5a^2 = 90 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \), we solve \( 27b - 45 = 90 \) to get \( b = 5 \).
3. The coefficient of \( x \) gives \( 3ab^2 - 10ab + a = 78 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 225 - 150 + 3 = 78 \).
4. The constant term gives \( b^3 - 5b^2 + b - 7 = -2 \). Substituting \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 125 - 125 + 5 - 7 = -2 \).

Thus, \( g(x) = 3x + 5 \) satisfies all conditions. Verifying by composing \( f(g(x)) \) confirms the result.

The function \( g(x) \) is \(\boxed{3x + 5}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find a function \( g(x) \) such that when I compose \( f \) and \( g \), meaning I plug \( g(x) \) into \( f \), I get \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \). The function \( f(x) \) is given as \( x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \). 

Let me write down what I know:

\( f(g(x)) = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \)

and

\( f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \).

So, substituting \( g(x) \) into \( f \), we have:

\( f(g(x)) = [g(x)]^3 - 5[g(x)]^2 + g(x) - 7 \).

This must equal \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \). Therefore, we need to solve for \( g(x) \) in the equation:

\( [g(x)]^3 - 5[g(x)]^2 + g(x) - 7 = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \).

Hmm, solving for \( g(x) \) here seems a bit complicated because it&#x27;s inside a cubic function. Maybe \( g(x) \) is a linear function? That would make sense because composing linear functions with polynomials can result in polynomials of the same degree. Since \( f(g(x)) \) is a cubic polynomial, and \( f(x) \) is cubic, then \( g(x) \) should be linear, right? Because the composition of two cubic functions would result in a 9th degree polynomial, which is not the case here. Wait, no, actually, if \( f(x) \) is cubic and \( g(x) \) is linear, then \( f(g(x)) \) would be a cubic function. If \( g(x) \) were quadratic, then \( f(g(x)) \) would be a 6th degree polynomial, which is not the case here. So, yes, \( g(x) \) is likely linear.

So let&#x27;s assume \( g(x) = ax + b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants to be determined.

Then, substituting into \( f \):

\( f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7 \).

Let me expand this step by step.

First, compute \( (ax + b)^3 \):

\( (ax + b)^3 = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 \).

Then, compute \( -5(ax + b)^2 \):

First, \( (ax + b)^2 = a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2 \), so multiplied by -5:

\( -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 \).

Then, \( (ax + b) \) is just \( ax + b \), so adding that:

\( ax + b \).

Finally, subtracting 7.

So putting all together:

\( f(g(x)) = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 + ax + b -7 \).

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

- The \( x^3 \) term: \( a^3 \).
- The \( x^2 \) terms: \( 3a^2b -5a^2 \).
- The \( x \) terms: \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a \).
- The constant terms: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 \).

This should equal \( 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2 \). Therefore, we can set up equations for each coefficient:

1. Coefficient of \( x^3 \): \( a^3 = 27 \).
2. Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( 3a^2b -5a^2 = 90 \).
3. Coefficient of \( x \): \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a = 78 \).
4. Constant term: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 = -2 \).

Let&#x27;s solve these equations step by step.

First, equation 1: \( a^3 = 27 \). Therefore, \( a = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \). So \( a = 3 \).

Now plug \( a = 3 \) into equation 2:

\( 3*(3)^2*b -5*(3)^2 = 90 \).

Compute that:

\( 3*9*b -5*9 = 90 \).

Simplify:

\( 27b -45 = 90 \).

Add 45 to both sides:

\( 27b = 135 \).

Divide by 27:

\( b = 5 \).

So now, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 5 \). Let&#x27;s check if this works with equation 3 and 4.

First, equation 3 with \( a =3 \), \( b =5 \):

Left-hand side (LHS):

\( 3*(3)*(5)^2 -10*(3)*(5) +3 \).

Compute each term:

First term: \( 3*3*25 = 225 \).

Second term: \( -10*3*5 = -150 \).

Third term: \( 3 \).

Total: \( 225 -150 +3 = 78 \).

Which matches the coefficient of \( x \), which is 78. Good.

Now equation 4:

\( (5)^3 -5*(5)^2 +5 -7 = 125 -125 +5 -7 = (125 -125) + (5 -7) = 0 -2 = -2 \).

Which matches the constant term. Perfect.

Therefore, \( g(x) = 3x +5 \).

Wait, so that&#x27;s the answer? Let me double-check by composing \( f(g(x)) \).

Compute \( f(g(x)) = f(3x +5) = (3x +5)^3 -5*(3x +5)^2 + (3x +5) -7 \).

First, compute \( (3x +5)^3 \):

Let me compute step by step:

First, \( (3x +5)^2 = 9x^2 + 30x +25 \).

Then, \( (3x +5)^3 = (3x +5)*(9x^2 +30x +25) \).

Multiply term by term:

3x*(9x^2) = 27x^3

3x*(30x) = 90x^2

3x*(25) = 75x

5*(9x^2) = 45x^2

5*(30x) = 150x

5*(25) = 125

Add them all up:

27x^3 +90x^2 +75x +45x^2 +150x +125 =

27x^3 + (90x^2 +45x^2) + (75x +150x) +125 =

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125.

Now, compute -5*(3x +5)^2:

We already have \( (3x +5)^2 =9x^2 +30x +25 \), so multiply by -5:

-45x^2 -150x -125.

Then, add (3x +5):

3x +5.

Subtract 7:

So total expression:

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125 -45x^2 -150x -125 +3x +5 -7.

Combine like terms:

- \( x^3 \): 27x^3.

- \( x^2 \): 135x^2 -45x^2 = 90x^2.

- \( x \): 225x -150x +3x = 78x.

- Constants: 125 -125 +5 -7 = (-2).

So indeed, we get 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2, which matches the given polynomial. Therefore, \( g(x) =3x +5 \) is correct.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{3x + 5} \).

**Final Answer**
The function \( g(x) \) is \boxed{3x + 5}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the function \( g(x) \) such that \( f(g(x)) = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \), where \( f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \), we assume \( g(x) \) is a linear function of the form \( g(x) = ax + b \).

Substituting \( g(x) = ax + b \) into \( f(x) \), we get:
\[
f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7
\]

Expanding and combining like terms, we match the coefficients with \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \):

1. The coefficient of \( x^3 \) gives \( a^3 = 27 \), so \( a = 3 \).
2. The coefficient of \( x^2 \) gives \( 3a^2b - 5a^2 = 90 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \), we solve \( 27b - 45 = 90 \) to get \( b = 5 \).
3. The coefficient of \( x \) gives \( 3ab^2 - 10ab + a = 78 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 225 - 150 + 3 = 78 \).
4. The constant term gives \( b^3 - 5b^2 + b - 7 = -2 \). Substituting \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 125 - 125 + 5 - 7 = -2 \).

Thus, \( g(x) = 3x + 5 \) satisfies all conditions. Verifying by composing \( f(g(x)) \) confirms the result.

The function \( g(x) \) is \(\boxed{3x + 5}\).          </p>

\( f(g(x)) = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \)

\( f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \).

So, substituting \( g(x) \) into \( f \), we have:

\( f(g(x)) = [g(x)]^3 - 5[g(x)]^2 + g(x) - 7 \).

This must equal \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \). Therefore, we need to solve for \( g(x) \) in the equation:

\( [g(x)]^3 - 5[g(x)]^2 + g(x) - 7 = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \).

Then, substituting into \( f \):

\( f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7 \).

Let me expand this step by step.

First, compute \( (ax + b)^3 \):

\( (ax + b)^3 = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 \).

Then, compute \( -5(ax + b)^2 \):

First, \( (ax + b)^2 = a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2 \), so multiplied by -5:

\( -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 \).

Then, \( (ax + b) \) is just \( ax + b \), so adding that:

\( ax + b \).

Finally, subtracting 7.

So putting all together:

\( f(g(x)) = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 + ax + b -7 \).

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

- The \( x^3 \) term: \( a^3 \).
- The \( x^2 \) terms: \( 3a^2b -5a^2 \).
- The \( x \) terms: \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a \).
- The constant terms: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 \).

This should equal \( 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2 \). Therefore, we can set up equations for each coefficient:

1. Coefficient of \( x^3 \): \( a^3 = 27 \).
2. Coefficient of \( x^2 \): \( 3a^2b -5a^2 = 90 \).
3. Coefficient of \( x \): \( 3ab^2 -10ab + a = 78 \).
4. Constant term: \( b^3 -5b^2 + b -7 = -2 \).

Let&#x27;s solve these equations step by step.

First, equation 1: \( a^3 = 27 \). Therefore, \( a = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \). So \( a = 3 \).

Now plug \( a = 3 \) into equation 2:

\( 3*(3)^2*b -5*(3)^2 = 90 \).

Compute that:

\( 3*9*b -5*9 = 90 \).

Simplify:

\( 27b -45 = 90 \).

Add 45 to both sides:

\( 27b = 135 \).

Divide by 27:

\( b = 5 \).

So now, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 5 \). Let&#x27;s check if this works with equation 3 and 4.

First, equation 3 with \( a =3 \), \( b =5 \):

Left-hand side (LHS):

\( 3*(3)*(5)^2 -10*(3)*(5) +3 \).

Compute each term:

First term: \( 3*3*25 = 225 \).

Second term: \( -10*3*5 = -150 \).

Third term: \( 3 \).

Total: \( 225 -150 +3 = 78 \).

Which matches the coefficient of \( x \), which is 78. Good.

Now equation 4:

\( (5)^3 -5*(5)^2 +5 -7 = 125 -125 +5 -7 = (125 -125) + (5 -7) = 0 -2 = -2 \).

Which matches the constant term. Perfect.

Therefore, \( g(x) = 3x +5 \).

Wait, so that&#x27;s the answer? Let me double-check by composing \( f(g(x)) \).

Compute \( f(g(x)) = f(3x +5) = (3x +5)^3 -5*(3x +5)^2 + (3x +5) -7 \).

First, compute \( (3x +5)^3 \):

Let me compute step by step:

First, \( (3x +5)^2 = 9x^2 + 30x +25 \).

Then, \( (3x +5)^3 = (3x +5)*(9x^2 +30x +25) \).

Multiply term by term:

3x*(9x^2) = 27x^3

3x*(30x) = 90x^2

3x*(25) = 75x

5*(9x^2) = 45x^2

5*(30x) = 150x

5*(25) = 125

Add them all up:

27x^3 +90x^2 +75x +45x^2 +150x +125 =

27x^3 + (90x^2 +45x^2) + (75x +150x) +125 =

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125.

Now, compute -5*(3x +5)^2:

We already have \( (3x +5)^2 =9x^2 +30x +25 \), so multiply by -5:

-45x^2 -150x -125.

Then, add (3x +5):

3x +5.

Subtract 7:

So total expression:

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125 -45x^2 -150x -125 +3x +5 -7.

Combine like terms:

- \( x^3 \): 27x^3.

- \( x^2 \): 135x^2 -45x^2 = 90x^2.

- \( x \): 225x -150x +3x = 78x.

- Constants: 125 -125 +5 -7 = (-2).

So indeed, we get 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2, which matches the given polynomial. Therefore, \( g(x) =3x +5 \) is correct.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{3x + 5} \).

**Final Answer**
The function \( g(x) \) is \boxed{3x + 5}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the function \( g(x) \) such that \( f(g(x)) = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \), where \( f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \), we assume \( g(x) \) is a linear function of the form \( g(x) = ax + b \).

Substituting \( g(x) = ax + b \) into \( f(x) \), we get:
\[
f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7

2. The coefficient of \( x^2 \) gives \( 3a^2b - 5a^2 = 90 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \), we solve \( 27b - 45 = 90 \) to get \( b = 5 \).
3. The coefficient of \( x \) gives \( 3ab^2 - 10ab + a = 78 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 225 - 150 + 3 = 78 \).
4. The constant term gives \( b^3 - 5b^2 + b - 7 = -2 \). Substituting \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 125 - 125 + 5 - 7 = -2 \).

Thus, \( g(x) = 3x + 5 \) satisfies all conditions. Verifying by composing \( f(g(x)) \) confirms the result.

First, compute \( (ax + b)^3 \):

\( (ax + b)^3 = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 \).

Then, compute \( -5(ax + b)^2 \):

First, \( (ax + b)^2 = a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2 \), so multiplied by -5:

\( -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 \).

Then, \( (ax + b) \) is just \( ax + b \), so adding that:

\( ax + b \).

Finally, subtracting 7.

So putting all together:

\( f(g(x)) = a^3x^3 + 3a^2b x^2 + 3ab^2 x + b^3 -5a^2x^2 -10abx -5b^2 + ax + b -7 \).

Now plug \( a = 3 \) into equation 2:

\( 3*(3)^2*b -5*(3)^2 = 90 \).

Compute that:

\( 3*9*b -5*9 = 90 \).

Simplify:

\( 27b -45 = 90 \).

Add 45 to both sides:

\( 27b = 135 \).

Divide by 27:

\( b = 5 \).

So now, \( a = 3 \), \( b = 5 \). Let&#x27;s check if this works with equation 3 and 4.

First, equation 3 with \( a =3 \), \( b =5 \):

Left-hand side (LHS):

\( 3*(3)*(5)^2 -10*(3)*(5) +3 \).

Compute each term:

First term: \( 3*3*25 = 225 \).

Second term: \( -10*3*5 = -150 \).

Third term: \( 3 \).

Total: \( 225 -150 +3 = 78 \).

Which matches the coefficient of \( x \), which is 78. Good.

Now equation 4:

\( (5)^3 -5*(5)^2 +5 -7 = 125 -125 +5 -7 = (125 -125) + (5 -7) = 0 -2 = -2 \).

Which matches the constant term. Perfect.

Therefore, \( g(x) = 3x +5 \).

Wait, so that&#x27;s the answer? Let me double-check by composing \( f(g(x)) \).

Compute \( f(g(x)) = f(3x +5) = (3x +5)^3 -5*(3x +5)^2 + (3x +5) -7 \).

First, compute \( (3x +5)^3 \):

Let me compute step by step:

First, \( (3x +5)^2 = 9x^2 + 30x +25 \).

Then, \( (3x +5)^3 = (3x +5)*(9x^2 +30x +25) \).

Multiply term by term:

3x*(9x^2) = 27x^3

3x*(30x) = 90x^2

3x*(25) = 75x

5*(9x^2) = 45x^2

5*(30x) = 150x

5*(25) = 125

Add them all up:

27x^3 +90x^2 +75x +45x^2 +150x +125 =

27x^3 + (90x^2 +45x^2) + (75x +150x) +125 =

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125.

Now, compute -5*(3x +5)^2:

We already have \( (3x +5)^2 =9x^2 +30x +25 \), so multiply by -5:

-45x^2 -150x -125.

Then, add (3x +5):

3x +5.

Subtract 7:

So total expression:

27x^3 +135x^2 +225x +125 -45x^2 -150x -125 +3x +5 -7.

Combine like terms:

- \( x^3 \): 27x^3.

- \( x^2 \): 135x^2 -45x^2 = 90x^2.

- \( x \): 225x -150x +3x = 78x.

- Constants: 125 -125 +5 -7 = (-2).

So indeed, we get 27x^3 +90x^2 +78x -2, which matches the given polynomial. Therefore, \( g(x) =3x +5 \) is correct.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{3x + 5} \).

**Final Answer**
The function \( g(x) \) is \boxed{3x + 5}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find the function \( g(x) \) such that \( f(g(x)) = 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \), where \( f(x) = x^3 - 5x^2 + x - 7 \), we assume \( g(x) \) is a linear function of the form \( g(x) = ax + b \).

Substituting \( g(x) = ax + b \) into \( f(x) \), we get:
\[
f(g(x)) = (ax + b)^3 - 5(ax + b)^2 + (ax + b) - 7
\]

Expanding and combining like terms, we match the coefficients with \( 27x^3 + 90x^2 + 78x - 2 \):

1. The coefficient of \( x^3 \) gives \( a^3 = 27 \), so \( a = 3 \).
2. The coefficient of \( x^2 \) gives \( 3a^2b - 5a^2 = 90 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \), we solve \( 27b - 45 = 90 \) to get \( b = 5 \).
3. The coefficient of \( x \) gives \( 3ab^2 - 10ab + a = 78 \). Substituting \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 225 - 150 + 3 = 78 \).
4. The constant term gives \( b^3 - 5b^2 + b - 7 = -2 \). Substituting \( b = 5 \), we verify \( 125 - 125 + 5 - 7 = -2 \).

Thus, \( g(x) = 3x + 5 \) satisfies all conditions. Verifying by composing \( f(g(x)) \) confirms the result.

The function \( g(x) \) is \(\boxed{3x + 5}\).          </p>
