Problem: To promote her school&#x27;s annual Kite Olympics, Genevieve makes a small kite and a large kite for a bulletin board display. For her small kite, Genevieve draws the kite on a grid with the points one inch apart, as shown below.

[asy]
for ( int x = 0; x &lt;= 6; ++x )
{

for ( int y = 0; y &lt;= 7; ++y )

{

dot((x,y));

}
}
draw((0,5)--(3,7)--(6,5)--(3,0)--cycle);
[/asy]

For the large kite she triples both the height and width of the entire grid.

What is the number of square inches in the area of the small kite? Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>

Problem: When Marika bought her house she paid $80\%$ of the purchase price of the house with a loan. She paid the remaining $\$49,400$ of the purchase price with her savings. What was the purchase price of her house? Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>

Response: \boxed{62,500}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Since she paid $80\%$ with loans, and the rest she paid with her savings, $20\%$ of the purchase price is what she paid with her savings.  Thus, if we call $x$ the total price of the house, we have: $\frac{x}{5} = 49400 \rightarrow x = \boxed{247000}$.          </p>

[/asy] We draw diagonals $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BD}$ and let the intersection point be $H$.  Since $\angle ADC=60^\circ$ and $AD=CD$, $\triangle ACD$ is equilateral, so $AC=24$.  Since $ABCD$ has two pairs of equal sides, it is a kite, and so its diagonals are perpendicular and $\overline{BD}$ bisects $\overline{AC}$.  Thus, \[AH=HC=24/2=12.\]Applying the Pythagorean Theorem on $\triangle BHC$ and $\triangle CHD$ gives \[BH=\sqrt{BC^2-HC^2}=\sqrt{13^2-12^2}=5\]and \[HD=\sqrt{CD^2-HC^2}=\sqrt{24^2-12^2}=12\sqrt{3}.\][asy]

Let $Y&#x27;$ be the midpoint of $\overline{CD}$.  We look at triangle $BCD$.  Since segment $\overline{XY&#x27;}$ connects midpoints $X$ and $Y&#x27;$, it is parallel to $\overline{BD}$ and has half the length of $\overline{BD}$.  Thus, \[XY&#x27; = \frac{1}{2}(BH+HD)=\frac{1}{2}(5+12\sqrt{3}).\]Now, we look at triangle $ACD$.  Similarly, since $Y$ and $Y&#x27;$ are midpoints, $\overline{YY&#x27;}$ is parallel to $\overline{AC}$ and has half the length of $\overline{AC}$, so \[YY&#x27; = 24/2=12.\]Since $\overline{BD} \perp \overline{AC}$, we have $\overline{XY&#x27;}\perp \overline{YY&#x27;}$, so $\angle XY&#x27;Y=90^\circ$.  Finally, we use the Pythagorean theorem on $\triangle XY&#x27;Y$ to compute \begin{align*}
XY^2=YY&#x27;^2+XY&#x27;^2&amp;=12^2+\left(\frac{1}{2}(5+12\sqrt{3})\right)^2\\
&amp;=144+\frac{1}{4}(25+120\sqrt{3}+144\cdot 3) \\

Let $Y&#x27;$ be the midpoint of $\overline{CD}$.  We look at triangle $BCD$.  Since segment $\overline{XY&#x27;}$ connects midpoints $X$ and $Y&#x27;$, it is parallel to $\overline{BD}$ and has half the length of $\overline{BD}$.  Thus, \[XY&#x27; = \frac{1}{2}(BH+HD)=\frac{1}{2}(5+12\sqrt{3}).\]Now, we look at triangle $ACD$.  Similarly, since $Y$ and $Y&#x27;$ are midpoints, $\overline{YY&#x27;}$ is parallel to $\overline{AC}$ and has half the length of $\overline{AC}$, so \[YY&#x27; = 24/2=12.\]Since $\overline{BD} \perp \overline{AC}$, we have $\overline{XY&#x27;}\perp \overline{YY&#x27;}$, so $\angle XY&#x27;Y=90^\circ$.  Finally, we use the Pythagorean theorem on $\triangle XY&#x27;Y$ to compute \begin{align*}
XY^2=YY&#x27;^2+XY&#x27;^2&amp;=12^2+\left(\frac{1}{2}(5+12\sqrt{3})\right)^2\\

Let $Y&#x27;$ be the midpoint of $\overline{CD}$.  We look at triangle $BCD$.  Since segment $\overline{XY&#x27;}$ connects midpoints $X$ and $Y&#x27;$, it is parallel to $\overline{BD}$ and has half the length of $\overline{BD}$.  Thus, \[XY&#x27; = \frac{1}{2}(BH+HD)=\frac{1}{2}(5+12\sqrt{3}).\]Now, we look at triangle $ACD$.  Similarly, since $Y$ and $Y&#x27;$ are midpoints, $\overline{YY&#x27;}$ is parallel to $\overline{AC}$ and has half the length of $\overline{AC}$, so \[YY&#x27; = 24/2=12.\]Since $\overline{BD} \perp \overline{AC}$, we have $\overline{XY&#x27;}\perp \overline{YY&#x27;}$, so $\angle XY&#x27;Y=90^\circ$.  Finally, we use the Pythagorean theorem on $\triangle XY&#x27;Y$ to compute \begin{align*}
XY^2=YY&#x27;^2+XY&#x27;^2&amp;=12^2+\left(\frac{1}{2}(5+12\sqrt{3})\right)^2\\
&amp;=144+\frac{1}{4}(25+120\sqrt{3}+144\cdot 3) \\

draw(A--B--C--D--cycle); draw(X--Y);

label(&quot;$A$&quot;,A,W); label(&quot;$B$&quot;,B,N); label(&quot;$C$&quot;,C,E); label(&quot;$D$&quot;,D,S); label(&quot;$X$&quot;,X,NE); label(&quot;$Y$&quot;,Y,SW);

[/asy] We draw diagonals $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BD}$ and let the intersection point be $H$.  Since $\angle ADC=60^\circ$ and $AD=CD$, $\triangle ACD$ is equilateral, so $AC=24$.  Since $ABCD$ has two pairs of equal sides, it is a kite, and so its diagonals are perpendicular and $\overline{BD}$ bisects $\overline{AC}$.  Thus, \[AH=HC=24/2=12.\]Applying the Pythagorean Theorem on $\triangle BHC$ and $\triangle CHD$ gives \[BH=\sqrt{BC^2-HC^2}=\sqrt{13^2-12^2}=5\]and \[HD=\sqrt{CD^2-HC^2}=\sqrt{24^2-12^2}=12\sqrt{3}.\][asy]

Let $Y&#x27;$ be the midpoint of $\overline{CD}$.  We look at triangle $BCD$.  Since segment $\overline{XY&#x27;}$ connects midpoints $X$ and $Y&#x27;$, it is parallel to $\overline{BD}$ and has half the length of $\overline{BD}$.  Thus, \[XY&#x27; = \frac{1}{2}(BH+HD)=\frac{1}{2}(5+12\sqrt{3}).\]Now, we look at triangle $ACD$.  Similarly, since $Y$ and $Y&#x27;$ are midpoints, $\overline{YY&#x27;}$ is parallel to $\overline{AC}$ and has half the length of $\overline{AC}$, so \[YY&#x27; = 24/2=12.\]Since $\overline{BD} \perp \overline{AC}$, we have $\overline{XY&#x27;}\perp \overline{YY&#x27;}$, so $\angle XY&#x27;Y=90^\circ$.  Finally, we use the Pythagorean theorem on $\triangle XY&#x27;Y$ to compute \begin{align*}
XY^2=YY&#x27;^2+XY&#x27;^2&amp;=12^2+\left(\frac{1}{2}(5+12\sqrt{3})\right)^2\\
&amp;=144+\frac{1}{4}(25+120\sqrt{3}+144\cdot 3) \\
&amp;= \boxed{\frac{1033}{4}+30\sqrt{3}}. \end{align*}          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of the circle that the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes onto. Hmm, bilinear transformations, also known as Möbius transformations, right? They have some properties like mapping circles and lines to circles or lines. Since both the real and imaginary axes are lines in the complex plane, their images under this transformation should be either circles or lines. The problem says &quot;onto the circle,&quot; so I guess both axes are mapped to the same circle? Or maybe each axis is mapped to a circle, and we need to find their radii? Wait, the question says &quot;the circle,&quot; so maybe both are mapped to the same circle? Let me check the wording again: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So, both axes are mapped to the same circle, and we need to find its radius. Alright, that makes sense.

First, let me recall that a bilinear transformation is determined by its action on three points. Also, since it&#x27;s a transformation from the extended complex plane to itself, it can map lines to circles and vice versa. The real and imaginary axes are both lines through the origin, but perpendicular to each other. The transformation \( f(z) \) is given, so maybe I can find images of points on the real axis and the imaginary axis and see what circle they lie on.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the real axis and the imaginary axis, plug them into the transformation, and then find the equation of the image curve, which should be a circle, and then find its radius.

Let me try this approach.

First, let&#x27;s handle the real axis. The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \), where \( t \) is a real number. Then, substitute \( z = t \) into the transformation:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \).

Similarly, the imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = i s \), where \( s \) is a real number. Substituting \( z = i s \):

\( f(i s) = \frac{i (i s) + 2}{4 (i s) + i} = \frac{-s + 2}{4 i s + i} = \frac{(-s + 2)}{i (4 s + 1)} \).

Let me compute both images and see if they lie on the same circle.

Starting with the real axis:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \). Let me write this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let me denote \( f(t) = u + iv \).

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize:

Denominator: \( 4 t + i \), conjugate is \( 4 t - i \).

So,

\( f(t) = \frac{(i t + 2)(4 t - i)}{(4 t + i)(4 t - i)} \).

Compute the denominator first:

\( (4 t)^2 - (i)^2 = 16 t^2 - (-1) = 16 t^2 + 1 \).

Numerator:

Expand \( (i t + 2)(4 t - i) \):

First term: \( i t \cdot 4 t = 4 i t^2 \)

Second term: \( i t \cdot (-i) = -i^2 t = -(-1) t = t \)

Third term: \( 2 \cdot 4 t = 8 t \)

Fourth term: \( 2 \cdot (-i) = -2 i \)

So combining all terms:

\( 4 i t^2 + t + 8 t - 2 i = 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \).

Therefore, the numerator is \( 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \), and the denominator is \( 16 t^2 + 1 \).

So, separating into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( 9 t / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Imaginary part: \( (4 t^2 - 2) / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Therefore, \( f(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \).

So, parametrizing the image of the real axis as \( (u(t), v(t)) \), where:

\( u(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

\( v(t) = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

Now, to find the equation of the circle that these points lie on, I can try to eliminate the parameter \( t \) from the equations for \( u \) and \( v \).

Let me set:

\( u = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (1)

\( v = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (2)

Let me solve equation (1) for \( t \):

From (1):

\( u (16 t^2 + 1) = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 + u = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 - 9 t + u = 0 \)

This is a quadratic equation in \( t \), but maybe it&#x27;s messy to solve for \( t \). Alternatively, let me express \( t \) from equation (1) in terms of \( u \), but it&#x27;s a quadratic, so maybe another approach.

Alternatively, notice that from equation (2), we can express \( 16 t^2 + 1 \) as denominator, so let me denote \( D = 16 t^2 + 1 \). Then:

\( u = 9 t / D \)

\( v = (4 t^2 - 2)/D \)

Then, let&#x27;s compute \( u^2 + v^2 \):

\( u^2 + v^2 = (81 t^2 + (4 t^2 - 2)^2) / D^2 \)

Compute numerator:

\( 81 t^2 + (16 t^4 - 16 t^2 + 4) = 16 t^4 + (81 t^2 - 16 t^2) + 4 = 16 t^4 + 65 t^2 + 4 \)

But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, express \( t \) in terms of \( u \) and substitute into \( v \).

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider that the image lies on a circle, so its equation can be written as \( (u - a)^2 + (v - b)^2 = r^2 \). We need to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( r \).

But since both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to the same circle, we might need to consider points from both images to determine the circle. Alternatively, maybe each axis maps to a circle, and both circles have the same radius? Wait, the problem states &quot;the circle&quot;, so perhaps both axes are mapped to the same circle. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the image of each axis is a circle, and we have to find the radius of each? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes,&quot; which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle, so their images coincide as a circle. Let me check with specific points.

First, check some points on the real axis and see where they are mapped.

Take z = 0 (on real axis): f(0) = (i*0 + 2)/(4*0 + i) = 2 / i = -2i.

Take z = ∞ (on extended real axis): The limit as t approaches ∞ of f(t) = (i t + 2)/(4 t + i) ≈ (i t)/(4 t) = i/4. So f(∞) = i/4.

Take z = 1: f(1) = (i + 2)/(4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 - i):

Numerator: (i + 2)(4 - i) = 4i - i^2 + 8 - 2i = (4i - 2i) + ( -i^2 +8 ) = 2i + 1 +8 = 2i +9

Denominator: (4 + i)(4 - i) = 16 - i^2 = 17

Thus, f(1) = (9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (9/17, 2/17)

Similarly, take z = -1: f(-1) = (-i + 2)/(-4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (-4 - i):

Numerator: (-i + 2)(-4 - i) = (-i)(-4) + (-i)(-i) + 2*(-4) + 2*(-i) = 4i + i^2 -8 -2i = (4i - 2i) + (-1 -8) = 2i -9

Denominator: (-4 + i)(-4 -i) = 16 - (i)^2 = 17

Thus, f(-1) = (-9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (-9/17, 2/17)

So these points are on the image of the real axis. Similarly, the points when z approaches 0 and ∞ are -2i and i/4. So plotting these points: -2i, i/4, (9/17, 2/17), (-9/17, 2/17). Hmm, these points seem to lie on a circle. Let&#x27;s check if they lie on the same circle.

First, let&#x27;s check if points -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17) lie on a circle.

A circle in the complex plane can be represented as |w - c| = r, where c is the center and r is the radius.

Let me consider three points: -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17).

First, represent these points in coordinates:

-2i is (0, -2)

i/4 is (0, 1/4)

(9/17, 2/17) is (9/17, 2/17)

So, three points: (0, -2), (0, 1/4), (9/17, 2/17)

We need to find the circle passing through these three points.

Let me denote the circle equation as \( (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Plugging in the three points:

1. For (0, -2):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (-2 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

2. For (0, 1/4):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (1/4 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

3. For (9/17, 2/17):

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

\( [a^2 + (b + 2)^2] - [a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( (b + 2)^2 - (b - 1/4)^2 = 0 \)

Expand both squares:

\( [b^2 +4b +4] - [b^2 - (1/2)b + 1/16] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( b^2 +4b +4 -b^2 + (1/2)b -1/16 = 0 \)

Combine like terms:

\( (4b + (1/2)b) + (4 - 1/16) = 0 \)

\( (9/2)b + (63/16) = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:

\( 72b + 63 = 0 \)

=&gt; 72b = -63 =&gt; b = -63/72 = -7/8

So, the y-coordinate of the center is -7/8.

Now, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 1:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 + 2 = -7/8 + 16/8 = 9/8

So,

\( a^2 + (9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Similarly, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 2:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 - 2/8 = -9/8

Thus,

\( a^2 + (-9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; same as above, so no new information.

Now, use equation 3 with b = -7/8:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - (-7/8))^2 = r^2 \)

First, compute 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16/136 + 119/136) = 135/136

So,

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = r^2 \)

We also have from equation 1: \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Set them equal:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Expand the left side:

\( (81/289 - (18/17)a + a^2) + (18225/18496) = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Simplify:

\( a^2 - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Cancel \( a^2 \):

\( - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = 81/64 \)

Multiply all terms by 18496 (which is 17^2 * 16^2) to eliminate denominators:

Let&#x27;s compute each term:

- (18/17)a * 18496 = -18 * 18496 /17 * a = -18*1088*a = -19584 a

81/289 *18496 = 81 * (18496 /289) = 81 * 64 = 5184

18225/18496 *18496 = 18225

81/64 *18496 = 81 * 18496 /64 = 81 * 289 = 23409

So the equation becomes:

-19584a + 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Compute 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Thus:

-19584a + 23409 = 23409

Subtract 23409:

-19584a = 0 =&gt; a = 0

Therefore, the center is at (0, -7/8) and radius squared is \( a^2 + 81/64 = 81/64 \), so radius is 9/8.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Wait, but let&#x27;s check if the point (9/17, 2/17) lies on this circle.

Center is (0, -7/8), radius 9/8.

Compute distance from (9/17, 2/17) to (0, -7/8):

Difference in x: 9/17 - 0 = 9/17

Difference in y: 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16 + 119)/136 = 135/136

Compute the distance squared:

(9/17)^2 + (135/136)^2

= 81/289 + 18225/18496

Convert to common denominator:

81/289 = (81 * 64)/ (289 * 64) = 5184/18496

18225/18496

Sum: 5184 + 18225 = 23409 /18496 = (153)^2 / (136)^2 = (153/136)^2

But 153 = 9*17, 136 = 8*17, so 153/136 = 9/8. Hence, distance squared is (9/8)^2, so distance is 9/8, which matches the radius. So, yes, the point is on the circle.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Now, let&#x27;s check the image of the imaginary axis. Earlier, we parametrized z = i s, so:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } \)

Let me simplify this expression.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s + 1)(-i) } \)

Wait, denominator: i*(4s +1)*(-i) = -i^2*(4s +1) = (1)*(4s +1) = 4s +1.

Numerator: (-s + 2)(-i) = (s - 2)i

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \)

So, written as \( u + iv \), this is:

\( u = 0 \), \( v = \frac{ s - 2 }{ 4s +1 } \)

Wait, hold on: Wait, if \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then the real part is 0 and the imaginary part is \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), right? Because multiplying by i gives a purely imaginary number.

Wait, but no: Let me check again. If we have \( \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then that&#x27;s equal to \( i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is a purely imaginary number. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points \( 0 + i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is the imaginary axis in the complex plane? But parametrized by s. Wait, but s is real, except when 4s +1 =0, i.e., s = -1/4, which would be a point at infinity.

But hold on, the image is a subset of the imaginary axis? But that can&#x27;t be, since the problem states that the transformation maps the axes to a circle. But according to this, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let&#x27;s recast the computation of f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis.

Given \( z = i s \), then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i} = \frac{ -s + 2 }{4i s + i } \)

Factor out i from the denominator:

\( \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } = \frac{ (-s + 2) }{i (4 s + 1)} \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1) } \)

Because denominator: \( i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1 \), so denominator becomes \( (4 s +1) \)

So, numerator is \( (s - 2)i \), so \( f(z) = \frac{(s - 2)i}{4 s +1 } \)

Therefore, this is a purely imaginary number scaled by \( \frac{(s - 2)}{4 s +1 } \). So the image is the imaginary axis? But parametrized with a real parameter s. Wait, but except when 4 s +1 =0, which would be s = -1/4, but as s approaches -1/4, the image goes to infinity.

But the imaginary axis is a line, not a circle. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. But since bilinear transformations map circles and lines to circles or lines, the image of the imaginary axis under this transformation is either a line or a circle. But according to this computation, it&#x27;s the imaginary axis, which is a line. But the problem states that it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So if the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line, then they can&#x27;t both be mapped to the same circle. But according to the problem statement, it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle onto which both axes are mapped. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my computation.

Wait, let&#x27;s re-examine the transformation. The transformation is \( f(z) = \frac{ i z + 2 }{4 z + i } \). Let me check if it&#x27;s invertible. The determinant of the coefficients matrix is (i)(i) - (2)(4) = (-1) - 8 = -9 ≠ 0, so it&#x27;s invertible.

Wait, when I computed the image of the imaginary axis, I substituted z = i s and found that f(z) is purely imaginary. But that would imply the image is the imaginary axis, but that contradicts the problem&#x27;s statement. Hmm. So perhaps my error is in the calculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s recompute the image of z = i s:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i } \)

Compute numerator: \( i^2 s + 2 = -s + 2 \)

Denominator: \( 4i s + i = i(4 s +1 ) \)

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i(4 s + 1) } \)

To express this in terms of real and imaginary parts, we can multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i(4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1 ) } \)

Since the denominator was multiplied by -i, which is the conjugate of i, to make it real.

Thus, the result is \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s +1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). So, as s varies over real numbers (excluding s = -1/4), the image is all purely imaginary numbers except when s approaches -1/4, which would approach infinity.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under f(z) is the imaginary axis in the w-plane, plus the point at infinity. But in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem states that both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to a circle. But according to the computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8 and center at (0, -7/8), while the imaginary axis is mapped to the imaginary line (which is a circle through infinity). Therefore, there must be an error here.

But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;. Maybe the problem is that in the finite plane, the image of the imaginary axis is a line, but perhaps when considering the extended complex plane, the line together with the point at infinity forms a circle. However, in that case, the radius would be infinite, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I have a miscalculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s check with specific points on the imaginary axis.

Take z = 0 (on imaginary axis? Wait, z=0 is on both axes, but in the parametrization z = i s, when s = 0, we get z=0. Then f(0) = 2/i = -2i, which is the same as before.

Take z = i (s=1): f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

Take z = 2i (s=2): f(2i) = (i*2i + 2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 + 2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) = 0.

Take z = i/2 (s=1/2): f(i/2) = (i*(i/2) +2)/(4*(i/2) +i) = (-1/2 + 2)/(2i +i) = (3/2)/(3i) = (3/2)/(3i) = 1/(2i) = -i/2.

Take z approaching infinity along the imaginary axis: s approaches infinity, so f(z) = ( -s + 2 ) / (4i s +i ) ≈ -s / 4i s = -1/(4i) = i/4.

So the images are: -2i, -i/5, 0, -i/2, and i/4. These points are all on the imaginary axis. So when s approaches infinity, f(z) approaches i/4, which is a finite point. When s approaches -1/4, the denominator 4s +1 approaches zero, so f(z) approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which in the extended complex plane is a circle. But in the standard complex plane, it&#x27;s a line. However, since Möbius transformations map lines to circles or lines, depending on whether they pass through the pole of the transformation.

But in our case, the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is not on the imaginary axis (since the imaginary axis is z = iy, and -i/4 is on the imaginary axis). Wait, z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis. Wait, the denominator 4z +i =0 when z = -i/4. Therefore, the point z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, and thus the transformation has a pole there. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation should be a circle, because the pole is on the original axis, so the image is a circle.

But according to the previous computation, the image seems to be the entire imaginary axis. But that contradicts. Wait, perhaps there&#x27;s a mistake here.

Wait, if the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is on the imaginary axis, then the image of the imaginary axis should be a circle in the extended complex plane. However, when we parameterized it, we obtained the entire imaginary axis except for the point at s = -1/4, which maps to infinity. Therefore, in the extended complex plane, the image is the imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which is a &quot;circle&quot; passing through infinity, i.e., a line. But according to Möbius transformation properties, if the original line passes through the pole, then the image is a line; otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle. Wait, maybe that&#x27;s the key.

Wait, the general property is that Möbius transformations map circles and lines to circles and lines. A line can be considered a circle passing through infinity. If the original line passes through the pole of the transformation (the point where the denominator is zero), then the image will pass through infinity, hence it&#x27;s a line. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle.

In our case, the real axis does not pass through the pole z = -i/4, since the pole is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle. The imaginary axis does pass through the pole z = -i/4, so its image is a line (the extended line, i.e., a circle passing through infinity).

But the problem states that the transformation maps both the real and imaginary axes onto the same circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Therefore, either the problem is ill-posed, or my computations are wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the image of each axis separately, and both images are circles, but with the same radius? Let me check again.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute the image of the imaginary axis again more carefully.

Parametrizing z = i s, then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (2 - s) }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(z) = \frac{ (2 - s)(-i) }{ (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ 4 s + 1 } \)

Thus, this is equal to \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s + 1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). Therefore, as s varies over ℝ \ { -1/4 }, the image is all imaginary numbers. However, when s approaches -1/4, the denominator approaches zero, so the image approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the extended imaginary axis (including infinity), which is a line in the extended complex plane. But the problem says it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle, which suggests a finite circle.

But according to my previous calculation, the image of the real axis is a circle with radius 9/8. However, the problem mentions &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle. But according to my computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misstated, or I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check another point on the imaginary axis. Take z = -i/4, which is the pole. But z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so it&#x27;s mapped to infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line plus infinity, which is a line in the extended plane. So that can&#x27;t be a circle. However, the problem says &quot;onto the circle&quot;, so maybe the question is actually only referring to the real axis? Or maybe the problem is in error.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation when considering the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s consider another approach. Let&#x27;s suppose that both images are circles. Wait, but we saw that the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line. However, maybe in the extended plane, the line is considered a circle, but the problem is asking for the radius in the standard plane, so only the real axis&#x27;s image is a circle with finite radius, and the imaginary axis&#x27;s image is a line, which has infinite radius. But the problem says &quot;the circle&quot;, so maybe the answer is 9/8, the radius from the real axis image.

But the problem states: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; If both axes are mapped to the same circle, but our calculation shows that the real axis is mapped to a circle and the imaginary axis to a line, there&#x27;s a problem. Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s try parametrizing the image of the imaginary axis again. Suppose I write w = f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis, so z = iy, y ∈ ℝ.

Then, w = (i*(iy) + 2)/(4*(iy) + i) = (-y + 2)/(4iy + i) = (2 - y)/(i(4y +1)).

Let me write w = u + iv.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

w = (2 - y)(-i)/(i(4y +1)(-i)) = (-i(2 - y))/( (4y +1) )

The denominator simplifies to (4y +1) because i*(-i) = 1.

Therefore, w = -i(2 - y)/(4y +1 ) = [ (y - 2)/(4y +1) ] i.

So, w is purely imaginary, with v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ), and u = 0.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ) for real y ≠ -1/4.

To see if this is a circle, we can parametrize v in terms of y:

Let me set t = y, then v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

This is a hyperbola or a straight line?

Wait, solving for t:

v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

Multiply both sides by (4t +1):

v(4t +1 ) = t -2

4v t + v = t -2

4v t - t = -2 - v

t(4v -1 ) = - (2 + v )

Therefore,

t = - (2 + v ) / (4v -1 )

This shows that for each v ≠ 1/4, there&#x27;s a corresponding t. But this parametrization covers all real numbers except v = 1/4, which would require the denominator 4v -1 =0, i.e., v=1/4. When v approaches 1/4, t approaches infinity.

But the image is the set of all points (0, v) where v can be any real number except v=1/4. Wait, but in reality, when t approaches infinity, v = (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t/(4t ) = 1/4. So, as t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4 from below. Similarly, when t approaches -1/4 from the right, denominator approaches zero, and v approaches ± infinity depending on the direction.

Wait, let&#x27;s analyze the function v(t) = (t -2)/(4t +1 )

Find the range of v(t):

As t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4.

As t approaches -1/4 from above, denominator approaches 0+, numerator approaches (-1/4 - 2 )= -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0+ = -infty.

As t approaches -1/4 from below, denominator approaches 0-, numerator approaches -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0- = +infty.

At t = 2, v=0.

Therefore, the function v(t) maps:

t ∈ (-∞, -1/4 ) to v ∈ (1/4, +infty ) (wait, hold on):

Wait, let&#x27;s check:

For t &lt; -1/4:

Denominator 4t +1 &lt; 0.

Numerator t -2: If t approaches -infty, t -2 approaches -infty.

So for t &lt; -1/4:

v = (negative)/(negative) = positive.

As t approaches -infty, v ≈ t /4t = 1/4. So from above.

Wait, as t approaches -infty, (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t /4t = 1/4, approaching 1/4 from above? Wait:

Let me compute the limit as t approaches -infty:

(t -2)/(4t +1 ) = [ t (1 - 2/t ) ] / [ t (4 + 1/t ) ] = (1 - 0)/(4 +0 ) = 1/4. So as t approaches -infty, v approaches 1/4 from above (since numerator is negative and denominator is negative, making positive, and when t approaches -infty, the difference from 1/4 is positive). Wait, not sure. Let me plug in t = -N where N is a large positive number:

v = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (N +2)/(4N -1 ) ≈ N /4N = 1/4. So approaching 1/4 from above? Let&#x27;s compute for large N:

(N +2)/(4N -1 ) = [N(1 + 2/N )]/[N(4 -1/N ) ] = (1 + 2/N )/(4 -1/N ) ≈ (1 +0 )/(4 -0 ) = 1/4. So as N increases, the value approaches 1/4 from slightly above? Let&#x27;s take N=1000:

(1000 +2 )/(4000 -1 ) = 1002/3999 ≈ 0.2506, which is slightly more than 1/4. So yes, approaches 1/4 from above.

Similarly, for t approaching -1/4 from the left (t approaching -1/4- ):

t approaching -1/4 from below (t = -1/4 - ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 - ε -2 ) = -9/4 - ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 - ε ) +1 = -1 -4ε +1 = -4ε

So v = (-9/4 - ε )/(-4ε ) = (9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (9/4)/4ε = 9/(16ε ), which approaches +infty as ε→0+.

For t approaching -1/4 from the right (t = -1/4 + ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 + ε -2 ) = -9/4 + ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 + ε ) +1 = -1 +4ε +1 = 4ε

v = (-9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (-9/4)/4ε = -9/(16ε ), which approaches -infty as ε→0+.

At t = 2: v=0.

Therefore, the range of v(t) is:

- When t ∈ (-infty, -1/4 ), v ∈ (1/4, +infty )

- When t ∈ (-1/4, ∞ ), v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 )

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 ) ∪ (1/4, +infty ), i.e., the entire imaginary axis except the point v=1/4. But in the extended complex plane, we include infinity, so the image is the entire imaginary axis (as a line), which makes sense because the pole at z=-i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so the image is a line.

But according to the problem statement, we should map both axes to a circle. This suggests a discrepancy. However, earlier computation showed that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I misinterpreted it. Maybe it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle that the real axis is mapped to, and separately the radius for the imaginary axis? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which seems to imply a single circle. But according to my calculations, they are mapped to different circles (one a finite circle, one a line). This is confusing.

Wait, maybe there&#x27;s a mistake in the computation for the image of the imaginary axis. Let me try a different approach. Instead of parametrizing z = i s, perhaps I should consider the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation f(z) and see if it can be represented as a circle.

The general method for finding the image of a line under a Möbius transformation is to take three points on the original line, find their images, and then determine the circle or line through those points.

Let&#x27;s apply this method to the imaginary axis.

Take three points on the imaginary axis:

1. z = 0: f(0) = 2/i = -2i.

2. z = i: f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

3. z = ∞: The transformation as z approaches ∞ along the imaginary axis: f(z) = (i*z + 2)/(4*z + i) ≈ (i*z)/(4*z) = i/4.

So the three image points are -2i, -i/5, and i/4.

These three points are on the imaginary axis. To determine if they lie on a circle, note that three colinear points (on the same line) lie on an infinite number of circles, but in the standard plane, the only circle that includes them is the line itself, considered as a circle with infinite radius. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line, which is a &quot;circle&quot; with infinite radius. But the problem asks for the radius of the circle, which is finite. Therefore, this suggests that only the real axis is mapped to a circle with finite radius, and the answer should be 9/8.

However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the circle, which contradicts our findings. Therefore, perhaps there&#x27;s an error in the problem or in my solution.

Wait, let&#x27;s cross-verify the image of the real axis. We found that it&#x27;s a circle with center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. Let me check if the images of the real axis include points from the imaginary axis&#x27;s image. For example, take z =0 (on both axes), maps to -2i, which is on the circle (distance from center (0, -7/8) to -2i (0, -2) is | -2 - (-7/8)| = |-16/8 +7/8| = |-9/8| = 9/8, which is the radius. So yes, -2i is on the circle. The point at infinity maps to i/4, which is also on the circle: center (0, -7/8), distance to i/4 (0, 1/4) is |1/4 - (-7/8)| = |1/4 +7/8| = |9/8| =9/8, which is the radius. The images of the real axis include points like i/4 and -2i, which are also images of points on the imaginary axis. Wait, hold on. The image of the real axis includes the point -2i (image of z=0) and i/4 (image of z=∞), which are also images of points on the imaginary axis (z=0 and z=∞). Similarly, images of the imaginary axis include -2i, which is also on the real axis&#x27;s image. Wait, but the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, but the circle we found for the real axis&#x27;s image includes some points on the imaginary axis. Specifically, the circle intersects the imaginary axis at -2i and i/4. But the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, which includes these two points. Therefore, perhaps the problem is referring to the circle that is the image of the real axis, and the image of the imaginary axis is the line that coincides with the imaginary axis, intersecting the circle at -2i and i/4. However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the same circle. Since the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line intersecting that circle at two points, but not the entire circle. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my previous reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary line. Let me check with another point.

Take z = 2i (s=2). Then f(2i) = (i*2i +2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 +2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) =0, which is on the real axis&#x27;s image circle? Let&#x27;s check. The circle has center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. The point 0 is at (0,0). The distance from (0,0) to (0, -7/8) is 7/8, which is less than 9/8, so 0 is inside the circle. Wait, but 0 is the image of z=2i, which is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, 0 is inside the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis includes points inside the circle. But the image of the real axis is the circle itself. So the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary axis, which intersects the circle at -2i and i/4, and passes through 0 inside the circle. Therefore, the two images are different: one is a circle, the other is a line intersecting the circle. So the problem statement must be incorrect, or I have a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem is to find the radius of the circle that both axes are mapped to, implying that both images coincide. In that case, my previous calculation must be wrong.

Wait, let&#x27;s see. The transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let me check if it&#x27;s an involution or has some symmetry. Let me compute f(f(z)):

Compute f(f(z)):

First, f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let&#x27;s substitute w = f(z):

f(w) = (i w +2 )/(4 w +i )

Substitute w = (i z +2)/(4 z +i ):

= [ i*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +2 ] / [4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ]

Simplify numerator:

[ (i^2 z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2 ] = [ (-z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2*(4 z +i )/(4 z +i ) ]

= [ (-z + 2i +8 z +2i )/(4 z +i ) ] = [7 z +4i )/(4 z +i )

Denominator:

[4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ] = [4i z +8 +i*(4 z +i ) ]/(4 z +i )

= [4i z +8 +4i z +i^2 ]/(4 z +i )

= [8i z +8 -1 ]/(4 z +i )

= (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i )

Therefore, f(f(z)) = [ (7 z +4i )/(4 z +i ) ] / [ (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i ) ] = (7 z +4i )/(8i z +7 )

This is not equal to z, so f is not an involution. Therefore, there&#x27;s no immediate symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation maps both axes to the same circle due to some symmetry. But my previous computations do not support this. The real axis maps to a circle, and the imaginary axis maps to a line. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in my solution.

Alternatively, maybe the question is to find the radius for each axis separately. For the real axis, we have radius 9/8. For the imaginary axis, since it&#x27;s mapped to a line, which can be thought of as a circle with infinite radius, but the problem asks for a finite radius. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 9/8.

Given the problem&#x27;s wording, and since the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line (infinite radius), but the problem mentions &quot;the circle&quot;, likely referring to the real axis&#x27;s image, which is a finite circle, the answer should be 9/8.

But to confirm, let&#x27;s see if any other references or methods can show that both images are the same circle.

Alternatively, suppose we consider the transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i )

Let me check if it maps the real axis to a circle and the imaginary axis to the same circle.

From previous calculations, the real axis maps to a circle with center (0, -7/8 ) and radius 9/8. The imaginary axis maps to the imaginary line, which intersects this circle at -2i and i/4. The points -2i and i/4 are both on the circle, as:

Distance from -2i (0, -2) to center (0, -7/8 ) is | -2 - (-7/8 ) | = |-9/8 | =9/8.

Distance from i/4 (0, 1/4 ) to center (0, -7/8 ) is |1/4 - (-7/8 ) | = |9/8 | =9/8.

But the rest of the imaginary axis is not on the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis is the line passing through -2i and i/4 and extending to infinity, which is the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is not the same as the image of the real axis, unless we consider the extended line as a circle, which has infinite radius.

Given that the problem asks for the radius of the circle, expecting a finite number, and given that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, I think the answer is 9/8.

Therefore, the radius is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the circle is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes, we analyze the images of these axes under the transformation.

### Image of the Real Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \) where \( t \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = t \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i}
   \]
3. **Separating Real and Imaginary Parts**:
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
   This gives the parametric equations:
   \[
   u(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1}, \quad v(t) = \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
4. **Finding the Circle**:
   - By eliminating the parameter \( t \), we find that the image lies on a circle.
   - The circle&#x27;s center is found to be \( (0, -\frac{7}{8}) \) and the radius is calculated as \( \frac{9}{8} \).

### Image of the Imaginary Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = is \) where \( s \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = is \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(is) = \frac{-s + 2}{i(4s + 1)}
   \]
3. **Simplifying**:
   - This results in purely imaginary numbers, indicating the image is a line (the imaginary axis in the complex plane).

### Conclusion
The real axis is mapped to a circle with radius \( \frac{9}{8} \). The imaginary axis is mapped to a line, which in the extended complex plane can be considered a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem specifies a finite radius, so we conclude the radius of the circle onto which the real axis is mapped is the answer.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of the circle that the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes onto. Hmm, bilinear transformations, also known as Möbius transformations, right? They have some properties like mapping circles and lines to circles or lines. Since both the real and imaginary axes are lines in the complex plane, their images under this transformation should be either circles or lines. The problem says &quot;onto the circle,&quot; so I guess both axes are mapped to the same circle? Or maybe each axis is mapped to a circle, and we need to find their radii? Wait, the question says &quot;the circle,&quot; so maybe both are mapped to the same circle? Let me check the wording again: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So, both axes are mapped to the same circle, and we need to find its radius. Alright, that makes sense.

First, let me recall that a bilinear transformation is determined by its action on three points. Also, since it&#x27;s a transformation from the extended complex plane to itself, it can map lines to circles and vice versa. The real and imaginary axes are both lines through the origin, but perpendicular to each other. The transformation \( f(z) \) is given, so maybe I can find images of points on the real axis and the imaginary axis and see what circle they lie on.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the real axis and the imaginary axis, plug them into the transformation, and then find the equation of the image curve, which should be a circle, and then find its radius.

Let me try this approach.

First, let&#x27;s handle the real axis. The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \), where \( t \) is a real number. Then, substitute \( z = t \) into the transformation:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \).

Similarly, the imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = i s \), where \( s \) is a real number. Substituting \( z = i s \):

\( f(i s) = \frac{i (i s) + 2}{4 (i s) + i} = \frac{-s + 2}{4 i s + i} = \frac{(-s + 2)}{i (4 s + 1)} \).

Let me compute both images and see if they lie on the same circle.

Starting with the real axis:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \). Let me write this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let me denote \( f(t) = u + iv \).

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize:

Denominator: \( 4 t + i \), conjugate is \( 4 t - i \).

So,

\( f(t) = \frac{(i t + 2)(4 t - i)}{(4 t + i)(4 t - i)} \).

Compute the denominator first:

\( (4 t)^2 - (i)^2 = 16 t^2 - (-1) = 16 t^2 + 1 \).

Numerator:

Expand \( (i t + 2)(4 t - i) \):

First term: \( i t \cdot 4 t = 4 i t^2 \)

Second term: \( i t \cdot (-i) = -i^2 t = -(-1) t = t \)

Third term: \( 2 \cdot 4 t = 8 t \)

Fourth term: \( 2 \cdot (-i) = -2 i \)

So combining all terms:

\( 4 i t^2 + t + 8 t - 2 i = 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \).

Therefore, the numerator is \( 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \), and the denominator is \( 16 t^2 + 1 \).

So, separating into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( 9 t / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Imaginary part: \( (4 t^2 - 2) / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Therefore, \( f(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \).

So, parametrizing the image of the real axis as \( (u(t), v(t)) \), where:

\( u(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

\( v(t) = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

Now, to find the equation of the circle that these points lie on, I can try to eliminate the parameter \( t \) from the equations for \( u \) and \( v \).

Let me set:

\( u = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (1)

\( v = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (2)

Let me solve equation (1) for \( t \):

From (1):

\( u (16 t^2 + 1) = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 + u = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 - 9 t + u = 0 \)

This is a quadratic equation in \( t \), but maybe it&#x27;s messy to solve for \( t \). Alternatively, let me express \( t \) from equation (1) in terms of \( u \), but it&#x27;s a quadratic, so maybe another approach.

Alternatively, notice that from equation (2), we can express \( 16 t^2 + 1 \) as denominator, so let me denote \( D = 16 t^2 + 1 \). Then:

\( u = 9 t / D \)

\( v = (4 t^2 - 2)/D \)

Then, let&#x27;s compute \( u^2 + v^2 \):

\( u^2 + v^2 = (81 t^2 + (4 t^2 - 2)^2) / D^2 \)

Compute numerator:

\( 81 t^2 + (16 t^4 - 16 t^2 + 4) = 16 t^4 + (81 t^2 - 16 t^2) + 4 = 16 t^4 + 65 t^2 + 4 \)

But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, express \( t \) in terms of \( u \) and substitute into \( v \).

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider that the image lies on a circle, so its equation can be written as \( (u - a)^2 + (v - b)^2 = r^2 \). We need to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( r \).

But since both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to the same circle, we might need to consider points from both images to determine the circle. Alternatively, maybe each axis maps to a circle, and both circles have the same radius? Wait, the problem states &quot;the circle&quot;, so perhaps both axes are mapped to the same circle. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the image of each axis is a circle, and we have to find the radius of each? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes,&quot; which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle, so their images coincide as a circle. Let me check with specific points.

First, check some points on the real axis and see where they are mapped.

Take z = 0 (on real axis): f(0) = (i*0 + 2)/(4*0 + i) = 2 / i = -2i.

Take z = ∞ (on extended real axis): The limit as t approaches ∞ of f(t) = (i t + 2)/(4 t + i) ≈ (i t)/(4 t) = i/4. So f(∞) = i/4.

Take z = 1: f(1) = (i + 2)/(4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 - i):

Numerator: (i + 2)(4 - i) = 4i - i^2 + 8 - 2i = (4i - 2i) + ( -i^2 +8 ) = 2i + 1 +8 = 2i +9

Denominator: (4 + i)(4 - i) = 16 - i^2 = 17

Thus, f(1) = (9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (9/17, 2/17)

Similarly, take z = -1: f(-1) = (-i + 2)/(-4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (-4 - i):

Numerator: (-i + 2)(-4 - i) = (-i)(-4) + (-i)(-i) + 2*(-4) + 2*(-i) = 4i + i^2 -8 -2i = (4i - 2i) + (-1 -8) = 2i -9

Denominator: (-4 + i)(-4 -i) = 16 - (i)^2 = 17

Thus, f(-1) = (-9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (-9/17, 2/17)

So these points are on the image of the real axis. Similarly, the points when z approaches 0 and ∞ are -2i and i/4. So plotting these points: -2i, i/4, (9/17, 2/17), (-9/17, 2/17). Hmm, these points seem to lie on a circle. Let&#x27;s check if they lie on the same circle.

First, let&#x27;s check if points -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17) lie on a circle.

A circle in the complex plane can be represented as |w - c| = r, where c is the center and r is the radius.

Let me consider three points: -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17).

First, represent these points in coordinates:

-2i is (0, -2)

i/4 is (0, 1/4)

(9/17, 2/17) is (9/17, 2/17)

So, three points: (0, -2), (0, 1/4), (9/17, 2/17)

We need to find the circle passing through these three points.

Let me denote the circle equation as \( (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Plugging in the three points:

1. For (0, -2):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (-2 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

2. For (0, 1/4):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (1/4 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

3. For (9/17, 2/17):

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

\( [a^2 + (b + 2)^2] - [a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( (b + 2)^2 - (b - 1/4)^2 = 0 \)

Expand both squares:

\( [b^2 +4b +4] - [b^2 - (1/2)b + 1/16] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( b^2 +4b +4 -b^2 + (1/2)b -1/16 = 0 \)

Combine like terms:

\( (4b + (1/2)b) + (4 - 1/16) = 0 \)

\( (9/2)b + (63/16) = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:

\( 72b + 63 = 0 \)

=&gt; 72b = -63 =&gt; b = -63/72 = -7/8

So, the y-coordinate of the center is -7/8.

Now, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 1:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 + 2 = -7/8 + 16/8 = 9/8

So,

\( a^2 + (9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Similarly, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 2:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 - 2/8 = -9/8

Thus,

\( a^2 + (-9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; same as above, so no new information.

Now, use equation 3 with b = -7/8:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - (-7/8))^2 = r^2 \)

First, compute 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16/136 + 119/136) = 135/136

So,

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = r^2 \)

We also have from equation 1: \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Set them equal:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Expand the left side:

\( (81/289 - (18/17)a + a^2) + (18225/18496) = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Simplify:

\( a^2 - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Cancel \( a^2 \):

\( - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = 81/64 \)

Multiply all terms by 18496 (which is 17^2 * 16^2) to eliminate denominators:

Let&#x27;s compute each term:

- (18/17)a * 18496 = -18 * 18496 /17 * a = -18*1088*a = -19584 a

81/289 *18496 = 81 * (18496 /289) = 81 * 64 = 5184

18225/18496 *18496 = 18225

81/64 *18496 = 81 * 18496 /64 = 81 * 289 = 23409

So the equation becomes:

-19584a + 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Compute 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Thus:

-19584a + 23409 = 23409

Subtract 23409:

-19584a = 0 =&gt; a = 0

Therefore, the center is at (0, -7/8) and radius squared is \( a^2 + 81/64 = 81/64 \), so radius is 9/8.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Wait, but let&#x27;s check if the point (9/17, 2/17) lies on this circle.

Center is (0, -7/8), radius 9/8.

Compute distance from (9/17, 2/17) to (0, -7/8):

Difference in x: 9/17 - 0 = 9/17

Difference in y: 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16 + 119)/136 = 135/136

Compute the distance squared:

(9/17)^2 + (135/136)^2

= 81/289 + 18225/18496

Convert to common denominator:

81/289 = (81 * 64)/ (289 * 64) = 5184/18496

18225/18496

Sum: 5184 + 18225 = 23409 /18496 = (153)^2 / (136)^2 = (153/136)^2

But 153 = 9*17, 136 = 8*17, so 153/136 = 9/8. Hence, distance squared is (9/8)^2, so distance is 9/8, which matches the radius. So, yes, the point is on the circle.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Now, let&#x27;s check the image of the imaginary axis. Earlier, we parametrized z = i s, so:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } \)

Let me simplify this expression.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s + 1)(-i) } \)

Wait, denominator: i*(4s +1)*(-i) = -i^2*(4s +1) = (1)*(4s +1) = 4s +1.

Numerator: (-s + 2)(-i) = (s - 2)i

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \)

So, written as \( u + iv \), this is:

\( u = 0 \), \( v = \frac{ s - 2 }{ 4s +1 } \)

Wait, hold on: Wait, if \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then the real part is 0 and the imaginary part is \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), right? Because multiplying by i gives a purely imaginary number.

Wait, but no: Let me check again. If we have \( \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then that&#x27;s equal to \( i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is a purely imaginary number. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points \( 0 + i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is the imaginary axis in the complex plane? But parametrized by s. Wait, but s is real, except when 4s +1 =0, i.e., s = -1/4, which would be a point at infinity.

But hold on, the image is a subset of the imaginary axis? But that can&#x27;t be, since the problem states that the transformation maps the axes to a circle. But according to this, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let&#x27;s recast the computation of f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis.

Given \( z = i s \), then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i} = \frac{ -s + 2 }{4i s + i } \)

Factor out i from the denominator:

\( \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } = \frac{ (-s + 2) }{i (4 s + 1)} \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1) } \)

Because denominator: \( i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1 \), so denominator becomes \( (4 s +1) \)

So, numerator is \( (s - 2)i \), so \( f(z) = \frac{(s - 2)i}{4 s +1 } \)

Therefore, this is a purely imaginary number scaled by \( \frac{(s - 2)}{4 s +1 } \). So the image is the imaginary axis? But parametrized with a real parameter s. Wait, but except when 4 s +1 =0, which would be s = -1/4, but as s approaches -1/4, the image goes to infinity.

But the imaginary axis is a line, not a circle. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. But since bilinear transformations map circles and lines to circles or lines, the image of the imaginary axis under this transformation is either a line or a circle. But according to this computation, it&#x27;s the imaginary axis, which is a line. But the problem states that it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So if the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line, then they can&#x27;t both be mapped to the same circle. But according to the problem statement, it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle onto which both axes are mapped. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my computation.

Wait, let&#x27;s re-examine the transformation. The transformation is \( f(z) = \frac{ i z + 2 }{4 z + i } \). Let me check if it&#x27;s invertible. The determinant of the coefficients matrix is (i)(i) - (2)(4) = (-1) - 8 = -9 ≠ 0, so it&#x27;s invertible.

Wait, when I computed the image of the imaginary axis, I substituted z = i s and found that f(z) is purely imaginary. But that would imply the image is the imaginary axis, but that contradicts the problem&#x27;s statement. Hmm. So perhaps my error is in the calculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s recompute the image of z = i s:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i } \)

Compute numerator: \( i^2 s + 2 = -s + 2 \)

Denominator: \( 4i s + i = i(4 s +1 ) \)

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i(4 s + 1) } \)

To express this in terms of real and imaginary parts, we can multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i(4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1 ) } \)

Since the denominator was multiplied by -i, which is the conjugate of i, to make it real.

Thus, the result is \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s +1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). So, as s varies over real numbers (excluding s = -1/4), the image is all purely imaginary numbers except when s approaches -1/4, which would approach infinity.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under f(z) is the imaginary axis in the w-plane, plus the point at infinity. But in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem states that both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to a circle. But according to the computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8 and center at (0, -7/8), while the imaginary axis is mapped to the imaginary line (which is a circle through infinity). Therefore, there must be an error here.

But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;. Maybe the problem is that in the finite plane, the image of the imaginary axis is a line, but perhaps when considering the extended complex plane, the line together with the point at infinity forms a circle. However, in that case, the radius would be infinite, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I have a miscalculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s check with specific points on the imaginary axis.

Take z = 0 (on imaginary axis? Wait, z=0 is on both axes, but in the parametrization z = i s, when s = 0, we get z=0. Then f(0) = 2/i = -2i, which is the same as before.

Take z = i (s=1): f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

Take z = 2i (s=2): f(2i) = (i*2i + 2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 + 2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) = 0.

Take z = i/2 (s=1/2): f(i/2) = (i*(i/2) +2)/(4*(i/2) +i) = (-1/2 + 2)/(2i +i) = (3/2)/(3i) = (3/2)/(3i) = 1/(2i) = -i/2.

Take z approaching infinity along the imaginary axis: s approaches infinity, so f(z) = ( -s + 2 ) / (4i s +i ) ≈ -s / 4i s = -1/(4i) = i/4.

So the images are: -2i, -i/5, 0, -i/2, and i/4. These points are all on the imaginary axis. So when s approaches infinity, f(z) approaches i/4, which is a finite point. When s approaches -1/4, the denominator 4s +1 approaches zero, so f(z) approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which in the extended complex plane is a circle. But in the standard complex plane, it&#x27;s a line. However, since Möbius transformations map lines to circles or lines, depending on whether they pass through the pole of the transformation.

But in our case, the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is not on the imaginary axis (since the imaginary axis is z = iy, and -i/4 is on the imaginary axis). Wait, z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis. Wait, the denominator 4z +i =0 when z = -i/4. Therefore, the point z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, and thus the transformation has a pole there. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation should be a circle, because the pole is on the original axis, so the image is a circle.

But according to the previous computation, the image seems to be the entire imaginary axis. But that contradicts. Wait, perhaps there&#x27;s a mistake here.

Wait, if the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is on the imaginary axis, then the image of the imaginary axis should be a circle in the extended complex plane. However, when we parameterized it, we obtained the entire imaginary axis except for the point at s = -1/4, which maps to infinity. Therefore, in the extended complex plane, the image is the imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which is a &quot;circle&quot; passing through infinity, i.e., a line. But according to Möbius transformation properties, if the original line passes through the pole, then the image is a line; otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle. Wait, maybe that&#x27;s the key.

Wait, the general property is that Möbius transformations map circles and lines to circles and lines. A line can be considered a circle passing through infinity. If the original line passes through the pole of the transformation (the point where the denominator is zero), then the image will pass through infinity, hence it&#x27;s a line. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle.

In our case, the real axis does not pass through the pole z = -i/4, since the pole is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle. The imaginary axis does pass through the pole z = -i/4, so its image is a line (the extended line, i.e., a circle passing through infinity).

But the problem states that the transformation maps both the real and imaginary axes onto the same circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Therefore, either the problem is ill-posed, or my computations are wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the image of each axis separately, and both images are circles, but with the same radius? Let me check again.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute the image of the imaginary axis again more carefully.

Parametrizing z = i s, then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (2 - s) }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(z) = \frac{ (2 - s)(-i) }{ (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ 4 s + 1 } \)

Thus, this is equal to \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s + 1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). Therefore, as s varies over ℝ \ { -1/4 }, the image is all imaginary numbers. However, when s approaches -1/4, the denominator approaches zero, so the image approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the extended imaginary axis (including infinity), which is a line in the extended complex plane. But the problem says it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle, which suggests a finite circle.

But according to my previous calculation, the image of the real axis is a circle with radius 9/8. However, the problem mentions &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle. But according to my computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misstated, or I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check another point on the imaginary axis. Take z = -i/4, which is the pole. But z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so it&#x27;s mapped to infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line plus infinity, which is a line in the extended plane. So that can&#x27;t be a circle. However, the problem says &quot;onto the circle&quot;, so maybe the question is actually only referring to the real axis? Or maybe the problem is in error.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation when considering the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s consider another approach. Let&#x27;s suppose that both images are circles. Wait, but we saw that the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line. However, maybe in the extended plane, the line is considered a circle, but the problem is asking for the radius in the standard plane, so only the real axis&#x27;s image is a circle with finite radius, and the imaginary axis&#x27;s image is a line, which has infinite radius. But the problem says &quot;the circle&quot;, so maybe the answer is 9/8, the radius from the real axis image.

But the problem states: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; If both axes are mapped to the same circle, but our calculation shows that the real axis is mapped to a circle and the imaginary axis to a line, there&#x27;s a problem. Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s try parametrizing the image of the imaginary axis again. Suppose I write w = f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis, so z = iy, y ∈ ℝ.

Then, w = (i*(iy) + 2)/(4*(iy) + i) = (-y + 2)/(4iy + i) = (2 - y)/(i(4y +1)).

Let me write w = u + iv.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

w = (2 - y)(-i)/(i(4y +1)(-i)) = (-i(2 - y))/( (4y +1) )

The denominator simplifies to (4y +1) because i*(-i) = 1.

Therefore, w = -i(2 - y)/(4y +1 ) = [ (y - 2)/(4y +1) ] i.

So, w is purely imaginary, with v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ), and u = 0.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ) for real y ≠ -1/4.

To see if this is a circle, we can parametrize v in terms of y:

Let me set t = y, then v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

This is a hyperbola or a straight line?

Wait, solving for t:

v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

Multiply both sides by (4t +1):

v(4t +1 ) = t -2

4v t + v = t -2

4v t - t = -2 - v

t(4v -1 ) = - (2 + v )

Therefore,

t = - (2 + v ) / (4v -1 )

This shows that for each v ≠ 1/4, there&#x27;s a corresponding t. But this parametrization covers all real numbers except v = 1/4, which would require the denominator 4v -1 =0, i.e., v=1/4. When v approaches 1/4, t approaches infinity.

But the image is the set of all points (0, v) where v can be any real number except v=1/4. Wait, but in reality, when t approaches infinity, v = (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t/(4t ) = 1/4. So, as t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4 from below. Similarly, when t approaches -1/4 from the right, denominator approaches zero, and v approaches ± infinity depending on the direction.

Wait, let&#x27;s analyze the function v(t) = (t -2)/(4t +1 )

Find the range of v(t):

As t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4.

As t approaches -1/4 from above, denominator approaches 0+, numerator approaches (-1/4 - 2 )= -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0+ = -infty.

As t approaches -1/4 from below, denominator approaches 0-, numerator approaches -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0- = +infty.

At t = 2, v=0.

Therefore, the function v(t) maps:

t ∈ (-∞, -1/4 ) to v ∈ (1/4, +infty ) (wait, hold on):

Wait, let&#x27;s check:

For t &lt; -1/4:

Denominator 4t +1 &lt; 0.

Numerator t -2: If t approaches -infty, t -2 approaches -infty.

So for t &lt; -1/4:

v = (negative)/(negative) = positive.

As t approaches -infty, v ≈ t /4t = 1/4. So from above.

Wait, as t approaches -infty, (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t /4t = 1/4, approaching 1/4 from above? Wait:

Let me compute the limit as t approaches -infty:

(t -2)/(4t +1 ) = [ t (1 - 2/t ) ] / [ t (4 + 1/t ) ] = (1 - 0)/(4 +0 ) = 1/4. So as t approaches -infty, v approaches 1/4 from above (since numerator is negative and denominator is negative, making positive, and when t approaches -infty, the difference from 1/4 is positive). Wait, not sure. Let me plug in t = -N where N is a large positive number:

v = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (N +2)/(4N -1 ) ≈ N /4N = 1/4. So approaching 1/4 from above? Let&#x27;s compute for large N:

(N +2)/(4N -1 ) = [N(1 + 2/N )]/[N(4 -1/N ) ] = (1 + 2/N )/(4 -1/N ) ≈ (1 +0 )/(4 -0 ) = 1/4. So as N increases, the value approaches 1/4 from slightly above? Let&#x27;s take N=1000:

(1000 +2 )/(4000 -1 ) = 1002/3999 ≈ 0.2506, which is slightly more than 1/4. So yes, approaches 1/4 from above.

Similarly, for t approaching -1/4 from the left (t approaching -1/4- ):

t approaching -1/4 from below (t = -1/4 - ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 - ε -2 ) = -9/4 - ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 - ε ) +1 = -1 -4ε +1 = -4ε

So v = (-9/4 - ε )/(-4ε ) = (9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (9/4)/4ε = 9/(16ε ), which approaches +infty as ε→0+.

For t approaching -1/4 from the right (t = -1/4 + ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 + ε -2 ) = -9/4 + ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 + ε ) +1 = -1 +4ε +1 = 4ε

v = (-9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (-9/4)/4ε = -9/(16ε ), which approaches -infty as ε→0+.

At t = 2: v=0.

Therefore, the range of v(t) is:

- When t ∈ (-infty, -1/4 ), v ∈ (1/4, +infty )

- When t ∈ (-1/4, ∞ ), v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 )

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 ) ∪ (1/4, +infty ), i.e., the entire imaginary axis except the point v=1/4. But in the extended complex plane, we include infinity, so the image is the entire imaginary axis (as a line), which makes sense because the pole at z=-i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so the image is a line.

But according to the problem statement, we should map both axes to a circle. This suggests a discrepancy. However, earlier computation showed that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I misinterpreted it. Maybe it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle that the real axis is mapped to, and separately the radius for the imaginary axis? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which seems to imply a single circle. But according to my calculations, they are mapped to different circles (one a finite circle, one a line). This is confusing.

Wait, maybe there&#x27;s a mistake in the computation for the image of the imaginary axis. Let me try a different approach. Instead of parametrizing z = i s, perhaps I should consider the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation f(z) and see if it can be represented as a circle.

The general method for finding the image of a line under a Möbius transformation is to take three points on the original line, find their images, and then determine the circle or line through those points.

Let&#x27;s apply this method to the imaginary axis.

Take three points on the imaginary axis:

1. z = 0: f(0) = 2/i = -2i.

2. z = i: f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

3. z = ∞: The transformation as z approaches ∞ along the imaginary axis: f(z) = (i*z + 2)/(4*z + i) ≈ (i*z)/(4*z) = i/4.

So the three image points are -2i, -i/5, and i/4.

These three points are on the imaginary axis. To determine if they lie on a circle, note that three colinear points (on the same line) lie on an infinite number of circles, but in the standard plane, the only circle that includes them is the line itself, considered as a circle with infinite radius. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line, which is a &quot;circle&quot; with infinite radius. But the problem asks for the radius of the circle, which is finite. Therefore, this suggests that only the real axis is mapped to a circle with finite radius, and the answer should be 9/8.

However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the circle, which contradicts our findings. Therefore, perhaps there&#x27;s an error in the problem or in my solution.

Wait, let&#x27;s cross-verify the image of the real axis. We found that it&#x27;s a circle with center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. Let me check if the images of the real axis include points from the imaginary axis&#x27;s image. For example, take z =0 (on both axes), maps to -2i, which is on the circle (distance from center (0, -7/8) to -2i (0, -2) is | -2 - (-7/8)| = |-16/8 +7/8| = |-9/8| = 9/8, which is the radius. So yes, -2i is on the circle. The point at infinity maps to i/4, which is also on the circle: center (0, -7/8), distance to i/4 (0, 1/4) is |1/4 - (-7/8)| = |1/4 +7/8| = |9/8| =9/8, which is the radius. The images of the real axis include points like i/4 and -2i, which are also images of points on the imaginary axis. Wait, hold on. The image of the real axis includes the point -2i (image of z=0) and i/4 (image of z=∞), which are also images of points on the imaginary axis (z=0 and z=∞). Similarly, images of the imaginary axis include -2i, which is also on the real axis&#x27;s image. Wait, but the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, but the circle we found for the real axis&#x27;s image includes some points on the imaginary axis. Specifically, the circle intersects the imaginary axis at -2i and i/4. But the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, which includes these two points. Therefore, perhaps the problem is referring to the circle that is the image of the real axis, and the image of the imaginary axis is the line that coincides with the imaginary axis, intersecting the circle at -2i and i/4. However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the same circle. Since the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line intersecting that circle at two points, but not the entire circle. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my previous reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary line. Let me check with another point.

Take z = 2i (s=2). Then f(2i) = (i*2i +2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 +2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) =0, which is on the real axis&#x27;s image circle? Let&#x27;s check. The circle has center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. The point 0 is at (0,0). The distance from (0,0) to (0, -7/8) is 7/8, which is less than 9/8, so 0 is inside the circle. Wait, but 0 is the image of z=2i, which is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, 0 is inside the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis includes points inside the circle. But the image of the real axis is the circle itself. So the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary axis, which intersects the circle at -2i and i/4, and passes through 0 inside the circle. Therefore, the two images are different: one is a circle, the other is a line intersecting the circle. So the problem statement must be incorrect, or I have a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem is to find the radius of the circle that both axes are mapped to, implying that both images coincide. In that case, my previous calculation must be wrong.

Wait, let&#x27;s see. The transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let me check if it&#x27;s an involution or has some symmetry. Let me compute f(f(z)):

Compute f(f(z)):

First, f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let&#x27;s substitute w = f(z):

f(w) = (i w +2 )/(4 w +i )

Substitute w = (i z +2)/(4 z +i ):

= [ i*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +2 ] / [4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ]

Simplify numerator:

[ (i^2 z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2 ] = [ (-z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2*(4 z +i )/(4 z +i ) ]

= [ (-z + 2i +8 z +2i )/(4 z +i ) ] = [7 z +4i )/(4 z +i )

Denominator:

[4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ] = [4i z +8 +i*(4 z +i ) ]/(4 z +i )

= [4i z +8 +4i z +i^2 ]/(4 z +i )

= [8i z +8 -1 ]/(4 z +i )

= (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i )

Therefore, f(f(z)) = [ (7 z +4i )/(4 z +i ) ] / [ (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i ) ] = (7 z +4i )/(8i z +7 )

This is not equal to z, so f is not an involution. Therefore, there&#x27;s no immediate symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation maps both axes to the same circle due to some symmetry. But my previous computations do not support this. The real axis maps to a circle, and the imaginary axis maps to a line. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in my solution.

Alternatively, maybe the question is to find the radius for each axis separately. For the real axis, we have radius 9/8. For the imaginary axis, since it&#x27;s mapped to a line, which can be thought of as a circle with infinite radius, but the problem asks for a finite radius. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 9/8.

Given the problem&#x27;s wording, and since the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line (infinite radius), but the problem mentions &quot;the circle&quot;, likely referring to the real axis&#x27;s image, which is a finite circle, the answer should be 9/8.

But to confirm, let&#x27;s see if any other references or methods can show that both images are the same circle.

Alternatively, suppose we consider the transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i )

Let me check if it maps the real axis to a circle and the imaginary axis to the same circle.

From previous calculations, the real axis maps to a circle with center (0, -7/8 ) and radius 9/8. The imaginary axis maps to the imaginary line, which intersects this circle at -2i and i/4. The points -2i and i/4 are both on the circle, as:

Distance from -2i (0, -2) to center (0, -7/8 ) is | -2 - (-7/8 ) | = |-9/8 | =9/8.

Distance from i/4 (0, 1/4 ) to center (0, -7/8 ) is |1/4 - (-7/8 ) | = |9/8 | =9/8.

But the rest of the imaginary axis is not on the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis is the line passing through -2i and i/4 and extending to infinity, which is the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is not the same as the image of the real axis, unless we consider the extended line as a circle, which has infinite radius.

Given that the problem asks for the radius of the circle, expecting a finite number, and given that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, I think the answer is 9/8.

Therefore, the radius is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the circle is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes, we analyze the images of these axes under the transformation.

### Image of the Real Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \) where \( t \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = t \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i}
   \]
3. **Separating Real and Imaginary Parts**:
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
   This gives the parametric equations:
   \[
   u(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1}, \quad v(t) = \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
4. **Finding the Circle**:
   - By eliminating the parameter \( t \), we find that the image lies on a circle.
   - The circle&#x27;s center is found to be \( (0, -\frac{7}{8}) \) and the radius is calculated as \( \frac{9}{8} \).

### Image of the Imaginary Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = is \) where \( s \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = is \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(is) = \frac{-s + 2}{i(4s + 1)}
   \]
3. **Simplifying**:
   - This results in purely imaginary numbers, indicating the image is a line (the imaginary axis in the complex plane).

### Conclusion
The real axis is mapped to a circle with radius \( \frac{9}{8} \). The imaginary axis is mapped to a line, which in the extended complex plane can be considered a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem specifies a finite radius, so we conclude the radius of the circle onto which the real axis is mapped is the answer.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of the circle that the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes onto. Hmm, bilinear transformations, also known as Möbius transformations, right? They have some properties like mapping circles and lines to circles or lines. Since both the real and imaginary axes are lines in the complex plane, their images under this transformation should be either circles or lines. The problem says &quot;onto the circle,&quot; so I guess both axes are mapped to the same circle? Or maybe each axis is mapped to a circle, and we need to find their radii? Wait, the question says &quot;the circle,&quot; so maybe both are mapped to the same circle? Let me check the wording again: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So, both axes are mapped to the same circle, and we need to find its radius. Alright, that makes sense.

First, let me recall that a bilinear transformation is determined by its action on three points. Also, since it&#x27;s a transformation from the extended complex plane to itself, it can map lines to circles and vice versa. The real and imaginary axes are both lines through the origin, but perpendicular to each other. The transformation \( f(z) \) is given, so maybe I can find images of points on the real axis and the imaginary axis and see what circle they lie on.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the real axis and the imaginary axis, plug them into the transformation, and then find the equation of the image curve, which should be a circle, and then find its radius.

Let me try this approach.

First, let&#x27;s handle the real axis. The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \), where \( t \) is a real number. Then, substitute \( z = t \) into the transformation:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \).

Similarly, the imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = i s \), where \( s \) is a real number. Substituting \( z = i s \):

\( f(i s) = \frac{i (i s) + 2}{4 (i s) + i} = \frac{-s + 2}{4 i s + i} = \frac{(-s + 2)}{i (4 s + 1)} \).

Let me compute both images and see if they lie on the same circle.

Starting with the real axis:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \). Let me write this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let me denote \( f(t) = u + iv \).

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize:

Denominator: \( 4 t + i \), conjugate is \( 4 t - i \).

So,

\( f(t) = \frac{(i t + 2)(4 t - i)}{(4 t + i)(4 t - i)} \).

Compute the denominator first:

\( (4 t)^2 - (i)^2 = 16 t^2 - (-1) = 16 t^2 + 1 \).

Numerator:

Expand \( (i t + 2)(4 t - i) \):

First term: \( i t \cdot 4 t = 4 i t^2 \)

Second term: \( i t \cdot (-i) = -i^2 t = -(-1) t = t \)

Third term: \( 2 \cdot 4 t = 8 t \)

Fourth term: \( 2 \cdot (-i) = -2 i \)

So combining all terms:

\( 4 i t^2 + t + 8 t - 2 i = 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \).

Therefore, the numerator is \( 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \), and the denominator is \( 16 t^2 + 1 \).

So, separating into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( 9 t / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Imaginary part: \( (4 t^2 - 2) / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Therefore, \( f(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \).

So, parametrizing the image of the real axis as \( (u(t), v(t)) \), where:

\( u(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

\( v(t) = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

Now, to find the equation of the circle that these points lie on, I can try to eliminate the parameter \( t \) from the equations for \( u \) and \( v \).

Let me set:

\( u = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (1)

\( v = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (2)

Let me solve equation (1) for \( t \):

From (1):

\( u (16 t^2 + 1) = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 + u = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 - 9 t + u = 0 \)

This is a quadratic equation in \( t \), but maybe it&#x27;s messy to solve for \( t \). Alternatively, let me express \( t \) from equation (1) in terms of \( u \), but it&#x27;s a quadratic, so maybe another approach.

Alternatively, notice that from equation (2), we can express \( 16 t^2 + 1 \) as denominator, so let me denote \( D = 16 t^2 + 1 \). Then:

\( u = 9 t / D \)

\( v = (4 t^2 - 2)/D \)

Then, let&#x27;s compute \( u^2 + v^2 \):

\( u^2 + v^2 = (81 t^2 + (4 t^2 - 2)^2) / D^2 \)

Compute numerator:

\( 81 t^2 + (16 t^4 - 16 t^2 + 4) = 16 t^4 + (81 t^2 - 16 t^2) + 4 = 16 t^4 + 65 t^2 + 4 \)

But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, express \( t \) in terms of \( u \) and substitute into \( v \).

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider that the image lies on a circle, so its equation can be written as \( (u - a)^2 + (v - b)^2 = r^2 \). We need to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( r \).

But since both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to the same circle, we might need to consider points from both images to determine the circle. Alternatively, maybe each axis maps to a circle, and both circles have the same radius? Wait, the problem states &quot;the circle&quot;, so perhaps both axes are mapped to the same circle. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the image of each axis is a circle, and we have to find the radius of each? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes,&quot; which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle, so their images coincide as a circle. Let me check with specific points.

First, check some points on the real axis and see where they are mapped.

Take z = 0 (on real axis): f(0) = (i*0 + 2)/(4*0 + i) = 2 / i = -2i.

Take z = ∞ (on extended real axis): The limit as t approaches ∞ of f(t) = (i t + 2)/(4 t + i) ≈ (i t)/(4 t) = i/4. So f(∞) = i/4.

Take z = 1: f(1) = (i + 2)/(4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 - i):

Numerator: (i + 2)(4 - i) = 4i - i^2 + 8 - 2i = (4i - 2i) + ( -i^2 +8 ) = 2i + 1 +8 = 2i +9

Denominator: (4 + i)(4 - i) = 16 - i^2 = 17

Thus, f(1) = (9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (9/17, 2/17)

Similarly, take z = -1: f(-1) = (-i + 2)/(-4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (-4 - i):

Numerator: (-i + 2)(-4 - i) = (-i)(-4) + (-i)(-i) + 2*(-4) + 2*(-i) = 4i + i^2 -8 -2i = (4i - 2i) + (-1 -8) = 2i -9

Denominator: (-4 + i)(-4 -i) = 16 - (i)^2 = 17

Thus, f(-1) = (-9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (-9/17, 2/17)

So these points are on the image of the real axis. Similarly, the points when z approaches 0 and ∞ are -2i and i/4. So plotting these points: -2i, i/4, (9/17, 2/17), (-9/17, 2/17). Hmm, these points seem to lie on a circle. Let&#x27;s check if they lie on the same circle.

First, let&#x27;s check if points -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17) lie on a circle.

A circle in the complex plane can be represented as |w - c| = r, where c is the center and r is the radius.

Let me consider three points: -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17).

First, represent these points in coordinates:

-2i is (0, -2)

i/4 is (0, 1/4)

(9/17, 2/17) is (9/17, 2/17)

So, three points: (0, -2), (0, 1/4), (9/17, 2/17)

We need to find the circle passing through these three points.

Let me denote the circle equation as \( (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Plugging in the three points:

1. For (0, -2):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (-2 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

2. For (0, 1/4):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (1/4 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

3. For (9/17, 2/17):

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

\( [a^2 + (b + 2)^2] - [a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( (b + 2)^2 - (b - 1/4)^2 = 0 \)

Expand both squares:

\( [b^2 +4b +4] - [b^2 - (1/2)b + 1/16] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( b^2 +4b +4 -b^2 + (1/2)b -1/16 = 0 \)

Combine like terms:

\( (4b + (1/2)b) + (4 - 1/16) = 0 \)

\( (9/2)b + (63/16) = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:

\( 72b + 63 = 0 \)

=&gt; 72b = -63 =&gt; b = -63/72 = -7/8

So, the y-coordinate of the center is -7/8.

Now, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 1:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 + 2 = -7/8 + 16/8 = 9/8

So,

\( a^2 + (9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Similarly, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 2:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 - 2/8 = -9/8

Thus,

\( a^2 + (-9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; same as above, so no new information.

Now, use equation 3 with b = -7/8:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - (-7/8))^2 = r^2 \)

First, compute 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16/136 + 119/136) = 135/136

So,

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = r^2 \)

We also have from equation 1: \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Set them equal:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Expand the left side:

\( (81/289 - (18/17)a + a^2) + (18225/18496) = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Simplify:

\( a^2 - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Cancel \( a^2 \):

\( - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = 81/64 \)

Multiply all terms by 18496 (which is 17^2 * 16^2) to eliminate denominators:

Let&#x27;s compute each term:

- (18/17)a * 18496 = -18 * 18496 /17 * a = -18*1088*a = -19584 a

81/289 *18496 = 81 * (18496 /289) = 81 * 64 = 5184

18225/18496 *18496 = 18225

81/64 *18496 = 81 * 18496 /64 = 81 * 289 = 23409

So the equation becomes:

-19584a + 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Compute 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Thus:

-19584a + 23409 = 23409

Subtract 23409:

-19584a = 0 =&gt; a = 0

Therefore, the center is at (0, -7/8) and radius squared is \( a^2 + 81/64 = 81/64 \), so radius is 9/8.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Wait, but let&#x27;s check if the point (9/17, 2/17) lies on this circle.

Center is (0, -7/8), radius 9/8.

Compute distance from (9/17, 2/17) to (0, -7/8):

Difference in x: 9/17 - 0 = 9/17

Difference in y: 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16 + 119)/136 = 135/136

Compute the distance squared:

(9/17)^2 + (135/136)^2

= 81/289 + 18225/18496

Convert to common denominator:

81/289 = (81 * 64)/ (289 * 64) = 5184/18496

18225/18496

Sum: 5184 + 18225 = 23409 /18496 = (153)^2 / (136)^2 = (153/136)^2

But 153 = 9*17, 136 = 8*17, so 153/136 = 9/8. Hence, distance squared is (9/8)^2, so distance is 9/8, which matches the radius. So, yes, the point is on the circle.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Now, let&#x27;s check the image of the imaginary axis. Earlier, we parametrized z = i s, so:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } \)

Let me simplify this expression.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s + 1)(-i) } \)

Wait, denominator: i*(4s +1)*(-i) = -i^2*(4s +1) = (1)*(4s +1) = 4s +1.

Numerator: (-s + 2)(-i) = (s - 2)i

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \)

So, written as \( u + iv \), this is:

\( u = 0 \), \( v = \frac{ s - 2 }{ 4s +1 } \)

Wait, hold on: Wait, if \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then the real part is 0 and the imaginary part is \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), right? Because multiplying by i gives a purely imaginary number.

Wait, but no: Let me check again. If we have \( \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then that&#x27;s equal to \( i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is a purely imaginary number. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points \( 0 + i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is the imaginary axis in the complex plane? But parametrized by s. Wait, but s is real, except when 4s +1 =0, i.e., s = -1/4, which would be a point at infinity.

But hold on, the image is a subset of the imaginary axis? But that can&#x27;t be, since the problem states that the transformation maps the axes to a circle. But according to this, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let&#x27;s recast the computation of f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis.

Given \( z = i s \), then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i} = \frac{ -s + 2 }{4i s + i } \)

Factor out i from the denominator:

\( \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } = \frac{ (-s + 2) }{i (4 s + 1)} \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1) } \)

Because denominator: \( i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1 \), so denominator becomes \( (4 s +1) \)

So, numerator is \( (s - 2)i \), so \( f(z) = \frac{(s - 2)i}{4 s +1 } \)

Therefore, this is a purely imaginary number scaled by \( \frac{(s - 2)}{4 s +1 } \). So the image is the imaginary axis? But parametrized with a real parameter s. Wait, but except when 4 s +1 =0, which would be s = -1/4, but as s approaches -1/4, the image goes to infinity.

But the imaginary axis is a line, not a circle. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. But since bilinear transformations map circles and lines to circles or lines, the image of the imaginary axis under this transformation is either a line or a circle. But according to this computation, it&#x27;s the imaginary axis, which is a line. But the problem states that it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So if the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line, then they can&#x27;t both be mapped to the same circle. But according to the problem statement, it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle onto which both axes are mapped. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my computation.

Wait, let&#x27;s re-examine the transformation. The transformation is \( f(z) = \frac{ i z + 2 }{4 z + i } \). Let me check if it&#x27;s invertible. The determinant of the coefficients matrix is (i)(i) - (2)(4) = (-1) - 8 = -9 ≠ 0, so it&#x27;s invertible.

Wait, when I computed the image of the imaginary axis, I substituted z = i s and found that f(z) is purely imaginary. But that would imply the image is the imaginary axis, but that contradicts the problem&#x27;s statement. Hmm. So perhaps my error is in the calculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s recompute the image of z = i s:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i } \)

Compute numerator: \( i^2 s + 2 = -s + 2 \)

Denominator: \( 4i s + i = i(4 s +1 ) \)

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i(4 s + 1) } \)

To express this in terms of real and imaginary parts, we can multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i(4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1 ) } \)

Since the denominator was multiplied by -i, which is the conjugate of i, to make it real.

Thus, the result is \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s +1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). So, as s varies over real numbers (excluding s = -1/4), the image is all purely imaginary numbers except when s approaches -1/4, which would approach infinity.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under f(z) is the imaginary axis in the w-plane, plus the point at infinity. But in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem states that both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to a circle. But according to the computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8 and center at (0, -7/8), while the imaginary axis is mapped to the imaginary line (which is a circle through infinity). Therefore, there must be an error here.

But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;. Maybe the problem is that in the finite plane, the image of the imaginary axis is a line, but perhaps when considering the extended complex plane, the line together with the point at infinity forms a circle. However, in that case, the radius would be infinite, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I have a miscalculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s check with specific points on the imaginary axis.

Take z = 0 (on imaginary axis? Wait, z=0 is on both axes, but in the parametrization z = i s, when s = 0, we get z=0. Then f(0) = 2/i = -2i, which is the same as before.

Take z = i (s=1): f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

Take z = 2i (s=2): f(2i) = (i*2i + 2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 + 2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) = 0.

Take z = i/2 (s=1/2): f(i/2) = (i*(i/2) +2)/(4*(i/2) +i) = (-1/2 + 2)/(2i +i) = (3/2)/(3i) = (3/2)/(3i) = 1/(2i) = -i/2.

Take z approaching infinity along the imaginary axis: s approaches infinity, so f(z) = ( -s + 2 ) / (4i s +i ) ≈ -s / 4i s = -1/(4i) = i/4.

So the images are: -2i, -i/5, 0, -i/2, and i/4. These points are all on the imaginary axis. So when s approaches infinity, f(z) approaches i/4, which is a finite point. When s approaches -1/4, the denominator 4s +1 approaches zero, so f(z) approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which in the extended complex plane is a circle. But in the standard complex plane, it&#x27;s a line. However, since Möbius transformations map lines to circles or lines, depending on whether they pass through the pole of the transformation.

But in our case, the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is not on the imaginary axis (since the imaginary axis is z = iy, and -i/4 is on the imaginary axis). Wait, z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis. Wait, the denominator 4z +i =0 when z = -i/4. Therefore, the point z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, and thus the transformation has a pole there. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation should be a circle, because the pole is on the original axis, so the image is a circle.

But according to the previous computation, the image seems to be the entire imaginary axis. But that contradicts. Wait, perhaps there&#x27;s a mistake here.

Wait, if the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is on the imaginary axis, then the image of the imaginary axis should be a circle in the extended complex plane. However, when we parameterized it, we obtained the entire imaginary axis except for the point at s = -1/4, which maps to infinity. Therefore, in the extended complex plane, the image is the imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which is a &quot;circle&quot; passing through infinity, i.e., a line. But according to Möbius transformation properties, if the original line passes through the pole, then the image is a line; otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle. Wait, maybe that&#x27;s the key.

Wait, the general property is that Möbius transformations map circles and lines to circles and lines. A line can be considered a circle passing through infinity. If the original line passes through the pole of the transformation (the point where the denominator is zero), then the image will pass through infinity, hence it&#x27;s a line. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle.

In our case, the real axis does not pass through the pole z = -i/4, since the pole is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle. The imaginary axis does pass through the pole z = -i/4, so its image is a line (the extended line, i.e., a circle passing through infinity).

But the problem states that the transformation maps both the real and imaginary axes onto the same circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Therefore, either the problem is ill-posed, or my computations are wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the image of each axis separately, and both images are circles, but with the same radius? Let me check again.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute the image of the imaginary axis again more carefully.

Parametrizing z = i s, then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (2 - s) }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(z) = \frac{ (2 - s)(-i) }{ (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ 4 s + 1 } \)

Thus, this is equal to \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s + 1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). Therefore, as s varies over ℝ \ { -1/4 }, the image is all imaginary numbers. However, when s approaches -1/4, the denominator approaches zero, so the image approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the extended imaginary axis (including infinity), which is a line in the extended complex plane. But the problem says it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle, which suggests a finite circle.

But according to my previous calculation, the image of the real axis is a circle with radius 9/8. However, the problem mentions &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle. But according to my computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misstated, or I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check another point on the imaginary axis. Take z = -i/4, which is the pole. But z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so it&#x27;s mapped to infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line plus infinity, which is a line in the extended plane. So that can&#x27;t be a circle. However, the problem says &quot;onto the circle&quot;, so maybe the question is actually only referring to the real axis? Or maybe the problem is in error.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation when considering the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s consider another approach. Let&#x27;s suppose that both images are circles. Wait, but we saw that the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line. However, maybe in the extended plane, the line is considered a circle, but the problem is asking for the radius in the standard plane, so only the real axis&#x27;s image is a circle with finite radius, and the imaginary axis&#x27;s image is a line, which has infinite radius. But the problem says &quot;the circle&quot;, so maybe the answer is 9/8, the radius from the real axis image.

But the problem states: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; If both axes are mapped to the same circle, but our calculation shows that the real axis is mapped to a circle and the imaginary axis to a line, there&#x27;s a problem. Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s try parametrizing the image of the imaginary axis again. Suppose I write w = f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis, so z = iy, y ∈ ℝ.

Then, w = (i*(iy) + 2)/(4*(iy) + i) = (-y + 2)/(4iy + i) = (2 - y)/(i(4y +1)).

Let me write w = u + iv.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

w = (2 - y)(-i)/(i(4y +1)(-i)) = (-i(2 - y))/( (4y +1) )

The denominator simplifies to (4y +1) because i*(-i) = 1.

Therefore, w = -i(2 - y)/(4y +1 ) = [ (y - 2)/(4y +1) ] i.

So, w is purely imaginary, with v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ), and u = 0.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ) for real y ≠ -1/4.

To see if this is a circle, we can parametrize v in terms of y:

Let me set t = y, then v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

This is a hyperbola or a straight line?

Wait, solving for t:

v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

Multiply both sides by (4t +1):

v(4t +1 ) = t -2

4v t + v = t -2

4v t - t = -2 - v

t(4v -1 ) = - (2 + v )

Therefore,

t = - (2 + v ) / (4v -1 )

This shows that for each v ≠ 1/4, there&#x27;s a corresponding t. But this parametrization covers all real numbers except v = 1/4, which would require the denominator 4v -1 =0, i.e., v=1/4. When v approaches 1/4, t approaches infinity.

But the image is the set of all points (0, v) where v can be any real number except v=1/4. Wait, but in reality, when t approaches infinity, v = (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t/(4t ) = 1/4. So, as t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4 from below. Similarly, when t approaches -1/4 from the right, denominator approaches zero, and v approaches ± infinity depending on the direction.

Wait, let&#x27;s analyze the function v(t) = (t -2)/(4t +1 )

Find the range of v(t):

As t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4.

As t approaches -1/4 from above, denominator approaches 0+, numerator approaches (-1/4 - 2 )= -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0+ = -infty.

As t approaches -1/4 from below, denominator approaches 0-, numerator approaches -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0- = +infty.

At t = 2, v=0.

Therefore, the function v(t) maps:

t ∈ (-∞, -1/4 ) to v ∈ (1/4, +infty ) (wait, hold on):

Wait, let&#x27;s check:

For t &lt; -1/4:

Denominator 4t +1 &lt; 0.

Numerator t -2: If t approaches -infty, t -2 approaches -infty.

So for t &lt; -1/4:

v = (negative)/(negative) = positive.

As t approaches -infty, v ≈ t /4t = 1/4. So from above.

Wait, as t approaches -infty, (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t /4t = 1/4, approaching 1/4 from above? Wait:

Let me compute the limit as t approaches -infty:

(t -2)/(4t +1 ) = [ t (1 - 2/t ) ] / [ t (4 + 1/t ) ] = (1 - 0)/(4 +0 ) = 1/4. So as t approaches -infty, v approaches 1/4 from above (since numerator is negative and denominator is negative, making positive, and when t approaches -infty, the difference from 1/4 is positive). Wait, not sure. Let me plug in t = -N where N is a large positive number:

v = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (N +2)/(4N -1 ) ≈ N /4N = 1/4. So approaching 1/4 from above? Let&#x27;s compute for large N:

(N +2)/(4N -1 ) = [N(1 + 2/N )]/[N(4 -1/N ) ] = (1 + 2/N )/(4 -1/N ) ≈ (1 +0 )/(4 -0 ) = 1/4. So as N increases, the value approaches 1/4 from slightly above? Let&#x27;s take N=1000:

(1000 +2 )/(4000 -1 ) = 1002/3999 ≈ 0.2506, which is slightly more than 1/4. So yes, approaches 1/4 from above.

Similarly, for t approaching -1/4 from the left (t approaching -1/4- ):

t approaching -1/4 from below (t = -1/4 - ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 - ε -2 ) = -9/4 - ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 - ε ) +1 = -1 -4ε +1 = -4ε

So v = (-9/4 - ε )/(-4ε ) = (9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (9/4)/4ε = 9/(16ε ), which approaches +infty as ε→0+.

For t approaching -1/4 from the right (t = -1/4 + ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 + ε -2 ) = -9/4 + ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 + ε ) +1 = -1 +4ε +1 = 4ε

v = (-9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (-9/4)/4ε = -9/(16ε ), which approaches -infty as ε→0+.

At t = 2: v=0.

Therefore, the range of v(t) is:

- When t ∈ (-infty, -1/4 ), v ∈ (1/4, +infty )

- When t ∈ (-1/4, ∞ ), v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 )

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 ) ∪ (1/4, +infty ), i.e., the entire imaginary axis except the point v=1/4. But in the extended complex plane, we include infinity, so the image is the entire imaginary axis (as a line), which makes sense because the pole at z=-i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so the image is a line.

But according to the problem statement, we should map both axes to a circle. This suggests a discrepancy. However, earlier computation showed that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I misinterpreted it. Maybe it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle that the real axis is mapped to, and separately the radius for the imaginary axis? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which seems to imply a single circle. But according to my calculations, they are mapped to different circles (one a finite circle, one a line). This is confusing.

Wait, maybe there&#x27;s a mistake in the computation for the image of the imaginary axis. Let me try a different approach. Instead of parametrizing z = i s, perhaps I should consider the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation f(z) and see if it can be represented as a circle.

The general method for finding the image of a line under a Möbius transformation is to take three points on the original line, find their images, and then determine the circle or line through those points.

Let&#x27;s apply this method to the imaginary axis.

Take three points on the imaginary axis:

1. z = 0: f(0) = 2/i = -2i.

2. z = i: f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

3. z = ∞: The transformation as z approaches ∞ along the imaginary axis: f(z) = (i*z + 2)/(4*z + i) ≈ (i*z)/(4*z) = i/4.

So the three image points are -2i, -i/5, and i/4.

These three points are on the imaginary axis. To determine if they lie on a circle, note that three colinear points (on the same line) lie on an infinite number of circles, but in the standard plane, the only circle that includes them is the line itself, considered as a circle with infinite radius. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line, which is a &quot;circle&quot; with infinite radius. But the problem asks for the radius of the circle, which is finite. Therefore, this suggests that only the real axis is mapped to a circle with finite radius, and the answer should be 9/8.

However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the circle, which contradicts our findings. Therefore, perhaps there&#x27;s an error in the problem or in my solution.

Wait, let&#x27;s cross-verify the image of the real axis. We found that it&#x27;s a circle with center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. Let me check if the images of the real axis include points from the imaginary axis&#x27;s image. For example, take z =0 (on both axes), maps to -2i, which is on the circle (distance from center (0, -7/8) to -2i (0, -2) is | -2 - (-7/8)| = |-16/8 +7/8| = |-9/8| = 9/8, which is the radius. So yes, -2i is on the circle. The point at infinity maps to i/4, which is also on the circle: center (0, -7/8), distance to i/4 (0, 1/4) is |1/4 - (-7/8)| = |1/4 +7/8| = |9/8| =9/8, which is the radius. The images of the real axis include points like i/4 and -2i, which are also images of points on the imaginary axis. Wait, hold on. The image of the real axis includes the point -2i (image of z=0) and i/4 (image of z=∞), which are also images of points on the imaginary axis (z=0 and z=∞). Similarly, images of the imaginary axis include -2i, which is also on the real axis&#x27;s image. Wait, but the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, but the circle we found for the real axis&#x27;s image includes some points on the imaginary axis. Specifically, the circle intersects the imaginary axis at -2i and i/4. But the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, which includes these two points. Therefore, perhaps the problem is referring to the circle that is the image of the real axis, and the image of the imaginary axis is the line that coincides with the imaginary axis, intersecting the circle at -2i and i/4. However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the same circle. Since the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line intersecting that circle at two points, but not the entire circle. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my previous reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary line. Let me check with another point.

Take z = 2i (s=2). Then f(2i) = (i*2i +2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 +2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) =0, which is on the real axis&#x27;s image circle? Let&#x27;s check. The circle has center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. The point 0 is at (0,0). The distance from (0,0) to (0, -7/8) is 7/8, which is less than 9/8, so 0 is inside the circle. Wait, but 0 is the image of z=2i, which is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, 0 is inside the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis includes points inside the circle. But the image of the real axis is the circle itself. So the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary axis, which intersects the circle at -2i and i/4, and passes through 0 inside the circle. Therefore, the two images are different: one is a circle, the other is a line intersecting the circle. So the problem statement must be incorrect, or I have a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem is to find the radius of the circle that both axes are mapped to, implying that both images coincide. In that case, my previous calculation must be wrong.

Wait, let&#x27;s see. The transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let me check if it&#x27;s an involution or has some symmetry. Let me compute f(f(z)):

Compute f(f(z)):

First, f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let&#x27;s substitute w = f(z):

f(w) = (i w +2 )/(4 w +i )

Substitute w = (i z +2)/(4 z +i ):

= [ i*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +2 ] / [4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ]

Simplify numerator:

[ (i^2 z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2 ] = [ (-z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2*(4 z +i )/(4 z +i ) ]

= [ (-z + 2i +8 z +2i )/(4 z +i ) ] = [7 z +4i )/(4 z +i )

Denominator:

[4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ] = [4i z +8 +i*(4 z +i ) ]/(4 z +i )

= [4i z +8 +4i z +i^2 ]/(4 z +i )

= [8i z +8 -1 ]/(4 z +i )

= (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i )

Therefore, f(f(z)) = [ (7 z +4i )/(4 z +i ) ] / [ (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i ) ] = (7 z +4i )/(8i z +7 )

This is not equal to z, so f is not an involution. Therefore, there&#x27;s no immediate symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation maps both axes to the same circle due to some symmetry. But my previous computations do not support this. The real axis maps to a circle, and the imaginary axis maps to a line. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in my solution.

Alternatively, maybe the question is to find the radius for each axis separately. For the real axis, we have radius 9/8. For the imaginary axis, since it&#x27;s mapped to a line, which can be thought of as a circle with infinite radius, but the problem asks for a finite radius. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 9/8.

Given the problem&#x27;s wording, and since the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line (infinite radius), but the problem mentions &quot;the circle&quot;, likely referring to the real axis&#x27;s image, which is a finite circle, the answer should be 9/8.

But to confirm, let&#x27;s see if any other references or methods can show that both images are the same circle.

Alternatively, suppose we consider the transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i )

Let me check if it maps the real axis to a circle and the imaginary axis to the same circle.

From previous calculations, the real axis maps to a circle with center (0, -7/8 ) and radius 9/8. The imaginary axis maps to the imaginary line, which intersects this circle at -2i and i/4. The points -2i and i/4 are both on the circle, as:

Distance from -2i (0, -2) to center (0, -7/8 ) is | -2 - (-7/8 ) | = |-9/8 | =9/8.

Distance from i/4 (0, 1/4 ) to center (0, -7/8 ) is |1/4 - (-7/8 ) | = |9/8 | =9/8.

But the rest of the imaginary axis is not on the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis is the line passing through -2i and i/4 and extending to infinity, which is the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is not the same as the image of the real axis, unless we consider the extended line as a circle, which has infinite radius.

Given that the problem asks for the radius of the circle, expecting a finite number, and given that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, I think the answer is 9/8.

Therefore, the radius is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the circle is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes, we analyze the images of these axes under the transformation.

### Image of the Real Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \) where \( t \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = t \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i}
   \]
3. **Separating Real and Imaginary Parts**:
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
   This gives the parametric equations:
   \[
   u(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1}, \quad v(t) = \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
4. **Finding the Circle**:
   - By eliminating the parameter \( t \), we find that the image lies on a circle.
   - The circle&#x27;s center is found to be \( (0, -\frac{7}{8}) \) and the radius is calculated as \( \frac{9}{8} \).

### Image of the Imaginary Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = is \) where \( s \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = is \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(is) = \frac{-s + 2}{i(4s + 1)}
   \]
3. **Simplifying**:
   - This results in purely imaginary numbers, indicating the image is a line (the imaginary axis in the complex plane).

### Conclusion
The real axis is mapped to a circle with radius \( \frac{9}{8} \). The imaginary axis is mapped to a line, which in the extended complex plane can be considered a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem specifies a finite radius, so we conclude the radius of the circle onto which the real axis is mapped is the answer.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of the circle that the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes onto. Hmm, bilinear transformations, also known as Möbius transformations, right? They have some properties like mapping circles and lines to circles or lines. Since both the real and imaginary axes are lines in the complex plane, their images under this transformation should be either circles or lines. The problem says &quot;onto the circle,&quot; so I guess both axes are mapped to the same circle? Or maybe each axis is mapped to a circle, and we need to find their radii? Wait, the question says &quot;the circle,&quot; so maybe both are mapped to the same circle? Let me check the wording again: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So, both axes are mapped to the same circle, and we need to find its radius. Alright, that makes sense.

First, let me recall that a bilinear transformation is determined by its action on three points. Also, since it&#x27;s a transformation from the extended complex plane to itself, it can map lines to circles and vice versa. The real and imaginary axes are both lines through the origin, but perpendicular to each other. The transformation \( f(z) \) is given, so maybe I can find images of points on the real axis and the imaginary axis and see what circle they lie on.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the real axis and the imaginary axis, plug them into the transformation, and then find the equation of the image curve, which should be a circle, and then find its radius.

Let me try this approach.

First, let&#x27;s handle the real axis. The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \), where \( t \) is a real number. Then, substitute \( z = t \) into the transformation:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \).

Similarly, the imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = i s \), where \( s \) is a real number. Substituting \( z = i s \):

\( f(i s) = \frac{i (i s) + 2}{4 (i s) + i} = \frac{-s + 2}{4 i s + i} = \frac{(-s + 2)}{i (4 s + 1)} \).

Let me compute both images and see if they lie on the same circle.

Starting with the real axis:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \). Let me write this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let me denote \( f(t) = u + iv \).

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize:

Denominator: \( 4 t + i \), conjugate is \( 4 t - i \).

So,

\( f(t) = \frac{(i t + 2)(4 t - i)}{(4 t + i)(4 t - i)} \).

Compute the denominator first:

\( (4 t)^2 - (i)^2 = 16 t^2 - (-1) = 16 t^2 + 1 \).

Numerator:

Expand \( (i t + 2)(4 t - i) \):

First term: \( i t \cdot 4 t = 4 i t^2 \)

Second term: \( i t \cdot (-i) = -i^2 t = -(-1) t = t \)

Third term: \( 2 \cdot 4 t = 8 t \)

Fourth term: \( 2 \cdot (-i) = -2 i \)

So combining all terms:

\( 4 i t^2 + t + 8 t - 2 i = 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \).

Therefore, the numerator is \( 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \), and the denominator is \( 16 t^2 + 1 \).

So, separating into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( 9 t / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Imaginary part: \( (4 t^2 - 2) / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Therefore, \( f(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \).

So, parametrizing the image of the real axis as \( (u(t), v(t)) \), where:

\( u(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

\( v(t) = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

Now, to find the equation of the circle that these points lie on, I can try to eliminate the parameter \( t \) from the equations for \( u \) and \( v \).

Let me set:

\( u = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (1)

\( v = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (2)

Let me solve equation (1) for \( t \):

From (1):

\( u (16 t^2 + 1) = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 + u = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 - 9 t + u = 0 \)

This is a quadratic equation in \( t \), but maybe it&#x27;s messy to solve for \( t \). Alternatively, let me express \( t \) from equation (1) in terms of \( u \), but it&#x27;s a quadratic, so maybe another approach.

Alternatively, notice that from equation (2), we can express \( 16 t^2 + 1 \) as denominator, so let me denote \( D = 16 t^2 + 1 \). Then:

\( u = 9 t / D \)

\( v = (4 t^2 - 2)/D \)

Then, let&#x27;s compute \( u^2 + v^2 \):

\( u^2 + v^2 = (81 t^2 + (4 t^2 - 2)^2) / D^2 \)

Compute numerator:

\( 81 t^2 + (16 t^4 - 16 t^2 + 4) = 16 t^4 + (81 t^2 - 16 t^2) + 4 = 16 t^4 + 65 t^2 + 4 \)

But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, express \( t \) in terms of \( u \) and substitute into \( v \).

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider that the image lies on a circle, so its equation can be written as \( (u - a)^2 + (v - b)^2 = r^2 \). We need to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( r \).

But since both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to the same circle, we might need to consider points from both images to determine the circle. Alternatively, maybe each axis maps to a circle, and both circles have the same radius? Wait, the problem states &quot;the circle&quot;, so perhaps both axes are mapped to the same circle. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the image of each axis is a circle, and we have to find the radius of each? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes,&quot; which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle, so their images coincide as a circle. Let me check with specific points.

First, check some points on the real axis and see where they are mapped.

Take z = 0 (on real axis): f(0) = (i*0 + 2)/(4*0 + i) = 2 / i = -2i.

Take z = ∞ (on extended real axis): The limit as t approaches ∞ of f(t) = (i t + 2)/(4 t + i) ≈ (i t)/(4 t) = i/4. So f(∞) = i/4.

Take z = 1: f(1) = (i + 2)/(4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 - i):

Numerator: (i + 2)(4 - i) = 4i - i^2 + 8 - 2i = (4i - 2i) + ( -i^2 +8 ) = 2i + 1 +8 = 2i +9

Denominator: (4 + i)(4 - i) = 16 - i^2 = 17

Thus, f(1) = (9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (9/17, 2/17)

Similarly, take z = -1: f(-1) = (-i + 2)/(-4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (-4 - i):

Numerator: (-i + 2)(-4 - i) = (-i)(-4) + (-i)(-i) + 2*(-4) + 2*(-i) = 4i + i^2 -8 -2i = (4i - 2i) + (-1 -8) = 2i -9

Denominator: (-4 + i)(-4 -i) = 16 - (i)^2 = 17

Thus, f(-1) = (-9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (-9/17, 2/17)

So these points are on the image of the real axis. Similarly, the points when z approaches 0 and ∞ are -2i and i/4. So plotting these points: -2i, i/4, (9/17, 2/17), (-9/17, 2/17). Hmm, these points seem to lie on a circle. Let&#x27;s check if they lie on the same circle.

First, let&#x27;s check if points -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17) lie on a circle.

A circle in the complex plane can be represented as |w - c| = r, where c is the center and r is the radius.

Let me consider three points: -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17).

First, represent these points in coordinates:

-2i is (0, -2)

i/4 is (0, 1/4)

(9/17, 2/17) is (9/17, 2/17)

So, three points: (0, -2), (0, 1/4), (9/17, 2/17)

We need to find the circle passing through these three points.

Let me denote the circle equation as \( (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Plugging in the three points:

1. For (0, -2):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (-2 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

2. For (0, 1/4):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (1/4 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

3. For (9/17, 2/17):

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

\( [a^2 + (b + 2)^2] - [a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( (b + 2)^2 - (b - 1/4)^2 = 0 \)

Expand both squares:

\( [b^2 +4b +4] - [b^2 - (1/2)b + 1/16] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( b^2 +4b +4 -b^2 + (1/2)b -1/16 = 0 \)

Combine like terms:

\( (4b + (1/2)b) + (4 - 1/16) = 0 \)

\( (9/2)b + (63/16) = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:

\( 72b + 63 = 0 \)

=&gt; 72b = -63 =&gt; b = -63/72 = -7/8

So, the y-coordinate of the center is -7/8.

Now, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 1:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 + 2 = -7/8 + 16/8 = 9/8

So,

\( a^2 + (9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Similarly, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 2:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 - 2/8 = -9/8

Thus,

\( a^2 + (-9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; same as above, so no new information.

Now, use equation 3 with b = -7/8:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - (-7/8))^2 = r^2 \)

First, compute 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16/136 + 119/136) = 135/136

So,

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = r^2 \)

We also have from equation 1: \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Set them equal:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Expand the left side:

\( (81/289 - (18/17)a + a^2) + (18225/18496) = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Simplify:

\( a^2 - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Cancel \( a^2 \):

\( - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = 81/64 \)

Multiply all terms by 18496 (which is 17^2 * 16^2) to eliminate denominators:

Let&#x27;s compute each term:

- (18/17)a * 18496 = -18 * 18496 /17 * a = -18*1088*a = -19584 a

81/289 *18496 = 81 * (18496 /289) = 81 * 64 = 5184

18225/18496 *18496 = 18225

81/64 *18496 = 81 * 18496 /64 = 81 * 289 = 23409

So the equation becomes:

-19584a + 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Compute 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Thus:

-19584a + 23409 = 23409

Subtract 23409:

-19584a = 0 =&gt; a = 0

Therefore, the center is at (0, -7/8) and radius squared is \( a^2 + 81/64 = 81/64 \), so radius is 9/8.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Wait, but let&#x27;s check if the point (9/17, 2/17) lies on this circle.

Center is (0, -7/8), radius 9/8.

Compute distance from (9/17, 2/17) to (0, -7/8):

Difference in x: 9/17 - 0 = 9/17

Difference in y: 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16 + 119)/136 = 135/136

Compute the distance squared:

(9/17)^2 + (135/136)^2

= 81/289 + 18225/18496

Convert to common denominator:

81/289 = (81 * 64)/ (289 * 64) = 5184/18496

18225/18496

Sum: 5184 + 18225 = 23409 /18496 = (153)^2 / (136)^2 = (153/136)^2

But 153 = 9*17, 136 = 8*17, so 153/136 = 9/8. Hence, distance squared is (9/8)^2, so distance is 9/8, which matches the radius. So, yes, the point is on the circle.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Now, let&#x27;s check the image of the imaginary axis. Earlier, we parametrized z = i s, so:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } \)

Let me simplify this expression.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s + 1)(-i) } \)

Wait, denominator: i*(4s +1)*(-i) = -i^2*(4s +1) = (1)*(4s +1) = 4s +1.

Numerator: (-s + 2)(-i) = (s - 2)i

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \)

So, written as \( u + iv \), this is:

\( u = 0 \), \( v = \frac{ s - 2 }{ 4s +1 } \)

Wait, hold on: Wait, if \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then the real part is 0 and the imaginary part is \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), right? Because multiplying by i gives a purely imaginary number.

Wait, but no: Let me check again. If we have \( \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then that&#x27;s equal to \( i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is a purely imaginary number. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points \( 0 + i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is the imaginary axis in the complex plane? But parametrized by s. Wait, but s is real, except when 4s +1 =0, i.e., s = -1/4, which would be a point at infinity.

But hold on, the image is a subset of the imaginary axis? But that can&#x27;t be, since the problem states that the transformation maps the axes to a circle. But according to this, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let&#x27;s recast the computation of f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis.

Given \( z = i s \), then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i} = \frac{ -s + 2 }{4i s + i } \)

Factor out i from the denominator:

\( \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } = \frac{ (-s + 2) }{i (4 s + 1)} \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1) } \)

Because denominator: \( i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1 \), so denominator becomes \( (4 s +1) \)

So, numerator is \( (s - 2)i \), so \( f(z) = \frac{(s - 2)i}{4 s +1 } \)

Therefore, this is a purely imaginary number scaled by \( \frac{(s - 2)}{4 s +1 } \). So the image is the imaginary axis? But parametrized with a real parameter s. Wait, but except when 4 s +1 =0, which would be s = -1/4, but as s approaches -1/4, the image goes to infinity.

But the imaginary axis is a line, not a circle. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. But since bilinear transformations map circles and lines to circles or lines, the image of the imaginary axis under this transformation is either a line or a circle. But according to this computation, it&#x27;s the imaginary axis, which is a line. But the problem states that it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So if the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line, then they can&#x27;t both be mapped to the same circle. But according to the problem statement, it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle onto which both axes are mapped. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my computation.

Wait, let&#x27;s re-examine the transformation. The transformation is \( f(z) = \frac{ i z + 2 }{4 z + i } \). Let me check if it&#x27;s invertible. The determinant of the coefficients matrix is (i)(i) - (2)(4) = (-1) - 8 = -9 ≠ 0, so it&#x27;s invertible.

Wait, when I computed the image of the imaginary axis, I substituted z = i s and found that f(z) is purely imaginary. But that would imply the image is the imaginary axis, but that contradicts the problem&#x27;s statement. Hmm. So perhaps my error is in the calculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s recompute the image of z = i s:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i } \)

Compute numerator: \( i^2 s + 2 = -s + 2 \)

Denominator: \( 4i s + i = i(4 s +1 ) \)

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i(4 s + 1) } \)

To express this in terms of real and imaginary parts, we can multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i(4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1 ) } \)

Since the denominator was multiplied by -i, which is the conjugate of i, to make it real.

Thus, the result is \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s +1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). So, as s varies over real numbers (excluding s = -1/4), the image is all purely imaginary numbers except when s approaches -1/4, which would approach infinity.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under f(z) is the imaginary axis in the w-plane, plus the point at infinity. But in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem states that both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to a circle. But according to the computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8 and center at (0, -7/8), while the imaginary axis is mapped to the imaginary line (which is a circle through infinity). Therefore, there must be an error here.

But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;. Maybe the problem is that in the finite plane, the image of the imaginary axis is a line, but perhaps when considering the extended complex plane, the line together with the point at infinity forms a circle. However, in that case, the radius would be infinite, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I have a miscalculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s check with specific points on the imaginary axis.

Take z = 0 (on imaginary axis? Wait, z=0 is on both axes, but in the parametrization z = i s, when s = 0, we get z=0. Then f(0) = 2/i = -2i, which is the same as before.

Take z = i (s=1): f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

Take z = 2i (s=2): f(2i) = (i*2i + 2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 + 2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) = 0.

Take z = i/2 (s=1/2): f(i/2) = (i*(i/2) +2)/(4*(i/2) +i) = (-1/2 + 2)/(2i +i) = (3/2)/(3i) = (3/2)/(3i) = 1/(2i) = -i/2.

Take z approaching infinity along the imaginary axis: s approaches infinity, so f(z) = ( -s + 2 ) / (4i s +i ) ≈ -s / 4i s = -1/(4i) = i/4.

So the images are: -2i, -i/5, 0, -i/2, and i/4. These points are all on the imaginary axis. So when s approaches infinity, f(z) approaches i/4, which is a finite point. When s approaches -1/4, the denominator 4s +1 approaches zero, so f(z) approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which in the extended complex plane is a circle. But in the standard complex plane, it&#x27;s a line. However, since Möbius transformations map lines to circles or lines, depending on whether they pass through the pole of the transformation.

But in our case, the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is not on the imaginary axis (since the imaginary axis is z = iy, and -i/4 is on the imaginary axis). Wait, z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis. Wait, the denominator 4z +i =0 when z = -i/4. Therefore, the point z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, and thus the transformation has a pole there. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation should be a circle, because the pole is on the original axis, so the image is a circle.

But according to the previous computation, the image seems to be the entire imaginary axis. But that contradicts. Wait, perhaps there&#x27;s a mistake here.

Wait, if the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is on the imaginary axis, then the image of the imaginary axis should be a circle in the extended complex plane. However, when we parameterized it, we obtained the entire imaginary axis except for the point at s = -1/4, which maps to infinity. Therefore, in the extended complex plane, the image is the imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which is a &quot;circle&quot; passing through infinity, i.e., a line. But according to Möbius transformation properties, if the original line passes through the pole, then the image is a line; otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle. Wait, maybe that&#x27;s the key.

Wait, the general property is that Möbius transformations map circles and lines to circles and lines. A line can be considered a circle passing through infinity. If the original line passes through the pole of the transformation (the point where the denominator is zero), then the image will pass through infinity, hence it&#x27;s a line. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle.

In our case, the real axis does not pass through the pole z = -i/4, since the pole is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle. The imaginary axis does pass through the pole z = -i/4, so its image is a line (the extended line, i.e., a circle passing through infinity).

But the problem states that the transformation maps both the real and imaginary axes onto the same circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Therefore, either the problem is ill-posed, or my computations are wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the image of each axis separately, and both images are circles, but with the same radius? Let me check again.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute the image of the imaginary axis again more carefully.

Parametrizing z = i s, then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (2 - s) }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(z) = \frac{ (2 - s)(-i) }{ (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ 4 s + 1 } \)

Thus, this is equal to \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s + 1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). Therefore, as s varies over ℝ \ { -1/4 }, the image is all imaginary numbers. However, when s approaches -1/4, the denominator approaches zero, so the image approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the extended imaginary axis (including infinity), which is a line in the extended complex plane. But the problem says it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle, which suggests a finite circle.

But according to my previous calculation, the image of the real axis is a circle with radius 9/8. However, the problem mentions &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle. But according to my computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misstated, or I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check another point on the imaginary axis. Take z = -i/4, which is the pole. But z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so it&#x27;s mapped to infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line plus infinity, which is a line in the extended plane. So that can&#x27;t be a circle. However, the problem says &quot;onto the circle&quot;, so maybe the question is actually only referring to the real axis? Or maybe the problem is in error.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation when considering the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s consider another approach. Let&#x27;s suppose that both images are circles. Wait, but we saw that the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line. However, maybe in the extended plane, the line is considered a circle, but the problem is asking for the radius in the standard plane, so only the real axis&#x27;s image is a circle with finite radius, and the imaginary axis&#x27;s image is a line, which has infinite radius. But the problem says &quot;the circle&quot;, so maybe the answer is 9/8, the radius from the real axis image.

But the problem states: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; If both axes are mapped to the same circle, but our calculation shows that the real axis is mapped to a circle and the imaginary axis to a line, there&#x27;s a problem. Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s try parametrizing the image of the imaginary axis again. Suppose I write w = f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis, so z = iy, y ∈ ℝ.

Then, w = (i*(iy) + 2)/(4*(iy) + i) = (-y + 2)/(4iy + i) = (2 - y)/(i(4y +1)).

Let me write w = u + iv.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

w = (2 - y)(-i)/(i(4y +1)(-i)) = (-i(2 - y))/( (4y +1) )

The denominator simplifies to (4y +1) because i*(-i) = 1.

Therefore, w = -i(2 - y)/(4y +1 ) = [ (y - 2)/(4y +1) ] i.

So, w is purely imaginary, with v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ), and u = 0.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ) for real y ≠ -1/4.

To see if this is a circle, we can parametrize v in terms of y:

Let me set t = y, then v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

This is a hyperbola or a straight line?

Wait, solving for t:

v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

Multiply both sides by (4t +1):

v(4t +1 ) = t -2

4v t + v = t -2

4v t - t = -2 - v

t(4v -1 ) = - (2 + v )

Therefore,

t = - (2 + v ) / (4v -1 )

This shows that for each v ≠ 1/4, there&#x27;s a corresponding t. But this parametrization covers all real numbers except v = 1/4, which would require the denominator 4v -1 =0, i.e., v=1/4. When v approaches 1/4, t approaches infinity.

But the image is the set of all points (0, v) where v can be any real number except v=1/4. Wait, but in reality, when t approaches infinity, v = (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t/(4t ) = 1/4. So, as t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4 from below. Similarly, when t approaches -1/4 from the right, denominator approaches zero, and v approaches ± infinity depending on the direction.

Wait, let&#x27;s analyze the function v(t) = (t -2)/(4t +1 )

Find the range of v(t):

As t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4.

As t approaches -1/4 from above, denominator approaches 0+, numerator approaches (-1/4 - 2 )= -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0+ = -infty.

As t approaches -1/4 from below, denominator approaches 0-, numerator approaches -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0- = +infty.

At t = 2, v=0.

Therefore, the function v(t) maps:

t ∈ (-∞, -1/4 ) to v ∈ (1/4, +infty ) (wait, hold on):

Wait, let&#x27;s check:

For t &lt; -1/4:

Denominator 4t +1 &lt; 0.

Numerator t -2: If t approaches -infty, t -2 approaches -infty.

So for t &lt; -1/4:

v = (negative)/(negative) = positive.

As t approaches -infty, v ≈ t /4t = 1/4. So from above.

Wait, as t approaches -infty, (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t /4t = 1/4, approaching 1/4 from above? Wait:

Let me compute the limit as t approaches -infty:

(t -2)/(4t +1 ) = [ t (1 - 2/t ) ] / [ t (4 + 1/t ) ] = (1 - 0)/(4 +0 ) = 1/4. So as t approaches -infty, v approaches 1/4 from above (since numerator is negative and denominator is negative, making positive, and when t approaches -infty, the difference from 1/4 is positive). Wait, not sure. Let me plug in t = -N where N is a large positive number:

v = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (N +2)/(4N -1 ) ≈ N /4N = 1/4. So approaching 1/4 from above? Let&#x27;s compute for large N:

(N +2)/(4N -1 ) = [N(1 + 2/N )]/[N(4 -1/N ) ] = (1 + 2/N )/(4 -1/N ) ≈ (1 +0 )/(4 -0 ) = 1/4. So as N increases, the value approaches 1/4 from slightly above? Let&#x27;s take N=1000:

(1000 +2 )/(4000 -1 ) = 1002/3999 ≈ 0.2506, which is slightly more than 1/4. So yes, approaches 1/4 from above.

Similarly, for t approaching -1/4 from the left (t approaching -1/4- ):

t approaching -1/4 from below (t = -1/4 - ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 - ε -2 ) = -9/4 - ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 - ε ) +1 = -1 -4ε +1 = -4ε

So v = (-9/4 - ε )/(-4ε ) = (9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (9/4)/4ε = 9/(16ε ), which approaches +infty as ε→0+.

For t approaching -1/4 from the right (t = -1/4 + ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 + ε -2 ) = -9/4 + ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 + ε ) +1 = -1 +4ε +1 = 4ε

v = (-9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (-9/4)/4ε = -9/(16ε ), which approaches -infty as ε→0+.

At t = 2: v=0.

Therefore, the range of v(t) is:

- When t ∈ (-infty, -1/4 ), v ∈ (1/4, +infty )

- When t ∈ (-1/4, ∞ ), v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 )

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 ) ∪ (1/4, +infty ), i.e., the entire imaginary axis except the point v=1/4. But in the extended complex plane, we include infinity, so the image is the entire imaginary axis (as a line), which makes sense because the pole at z=-i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so the image is a line.

But according to the problem statement, we should map both axes to a circle. This suggests a discrepancy. However, earlier computation showed that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I misinterpreted it. Maybe it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle that the real axis is mapped to, and separately the radius for the imaginary axis? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which seems to imply a single circle. But according to my calculations, they are mapped to different circles (one a finite circle, one a line). This is confusing.

Wait, maybe there&#x27;s a mistake in the computation for the image of the imaginary axis. Let me try a different approach. Instead of parametrizing z = i s, perhaps I should consider the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation f(z) and see if it can be represented as a circle.

The general method for finding the image of a line under a Möbius transformation is to take three points on the original line, find their images, and then determine the circle or line through those points.

Let&#x27;s apply this method to the imaginary axis.

Take three points on the imaginary axis:

1. z = 0: f(0) = 2/i = -2i.

2. z = i: f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

3. z = ∞: The transformation as z approaches ∞ along the imaginary axis: f(z) = (i*z + 2)/(4*z + i) ≈ (i*z)/(4*z) = i/4.

So the three image points are -2i, -i/5, and i/4.

These three points are on the imaginary axis. To determine if they lie on a circle, note that three colinear points (on the same line) lie on an infinite number of circles, but in the standard plane, the only circle that includes them is the line itself, considered as a circle with infinite radius. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line, which is a &quot;circle&quot; with infinite radius. But the problem asks for the radius of the circle, which is finite. Therefore, this suggests that only the real axis is mapped to a circle with finite radius, and the answer should be 9/8.

However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the circle, which contradicts our findings. Therefore, perhaps there&#x27;s an error in the problem or in my solution.

Wait, let&#x27;s cross-verify the image of the real axis. We found that it&#x27;s a circle with center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. Let me check if the images of the real axis include points from the imaginary axis&#x27;s image. For example, take z =0 (on both axes), maps to -2i, which is on the circle (distance from center (0, -7/8) to -2i (0, -2) is | -2 - (-7/8)| = |-16/8 +7/8| = |-9/8| = 9/8, which is the radius. So yes, -2i is on the circle. The point at infinity maps to i/4, which is also on the circle: center (0, -7/8), distance to i/4 (0, 1/4) is |1/4 - (-7/8)| = |1/4 +7/8| = |9/8| =9/8, which is the radius. The images of the real axis include points like i/4 and -2i, which are also images of points on the imaginary axis. Wait, hold on. The image of the real axis includes the point -2i (image of z=0) and i/4 (image of z=∞), which are also images of points on the imaginary axis (z=0 and z=∞). Similarly, images of the imaginary axis include -2i, which is also on the real axis&#x27;s image. Wait, but the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, but the circle we found for the real axis&#x27;s image includes some points on the imaginary axis. Specifically, the circle intersects the imaginary axis at -2i and i/4. But the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, which includes these two points. Therefore, perhaps the problem is referring to the circle that is the image of the real axis, and the image of the imaginary axis is the line that coincides with the imaginary axis, intersecting the circle at -2i and i/4. However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the same circle. Since the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line intersecting that circle at two points, but not the entire circle. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my previous reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary line. Let me check with another point.

Take z = 2i (s=2). Then f(2i) = (i*2i +2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 +2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) =0, which is on the real axis&#x27;s image circle? Let&#x27;s check. The circle has center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. The point 0 is at (0,0). The distance from (0,0) to (0, -7/8) is 7/8, which is less than 9/8, so 0 is inside the circle. Wait, but 0 is the image of z=2i, which is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, 0 is inside the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis includes points inside the circle. But the image of the real axis is the circle itself. So the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary axis, which intersects the circle at -2i and i/4, and passes through 0 inside the circle. Therefore, the two images are different: one is a circle, the other is a line intersecting the circle. So the problem statement must be incorrect, or I have a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem is to find the radius of the circle that both axes are mapped to, implying that both images coincide. In that case, my previous calculation must be wrong.

Wait, let&#x27;s see. The transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let me check if it&#x27;s an involution or has some symmetry. Let me compute f(f(z)):

Compute f(f(z)):

First, f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let&#x27;s substitute w = f(z):

f(w) = (i w +2 )/(4 w +i )

Substitute w = (i z +2)/(4 z +i ):

= [ i*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +2 ] / [4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ]

Simplify numerator:

[ (i^2 z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2 ] = [ (-z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2*(4 z +i )/(4 z +i ) ]

= [ (-z + 2i +8 z +2i )/(4 z +i ) ] = [7 z +4i )/(4 z +i )

Denominator:

[4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ] = [4i z +8 +i*(4 z +i ) ]/(4 z +i )

= [4i z +8 +4i z +i^2 ]/(4 z +i )

= [8i z +8 -1 ]/(4 z +i )

= (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i )

Therefore, f(f(z)) = [ (7 z +4i )/(4 z +i ) ] / [ (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i ) ] = (7 z +4i )/(8i z +7 )

This is not equal to z, so f is not an involution. Therefore, there&#x27;s no immediate symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation maps both axes to the same circle due to some symmetry. But my previous computations do not support this. The real axis maps to a circle, and the imaginary axis maps to a line. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in my solution.

Alternatively, maybe the question is to find the radius for each axis separately. For the real axis, we have radius 9/8. For the imaginary axis, since it&#x27;s mapped to a line, which can be thought of as a circle with infinite radius, but the problem asks for a finite radius. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 9/8.

Given the problem&#x27;s wording, and since the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line (infinite radius), but the problem mentions &quot;the circle&quot;, likely referring to the real axis&#x27;s image, which is a finite circle, the answer should be 9/8.

But to confirm, let&#x27;s see if any other references or methods can show that both images are the same circle.

Alternatively, suppose we consider the transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i )

Let me check if it maps the real axis to a circle and the imaginary axis to the same circle.

From previous calculations, the real axis maps to a circle with center (0, -7/8 ) and radius 9/8. The imaginary axis maps to the imaginary line, which intersects this circle at -2i and i/4. The points -2i and i/4 are both on the circle, as:

Distance from -2i (0, -2) to center (0, -7/8 ) is | -2 - (-7/8 ) | = |-9/8 | =9/8.

Distance from i/4 (0, 1/4 ) to center (0, -7/8 ) is |1/4 - (-7/8 ) | = |9/8 | =9/8.

But the rest of the imaginary axis is not on the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis is the line passing through -2i and i/4 and extending to infinity, which is the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is not the same as the image of the real axis, unless we consider the extended line as a circle, which has infinite radius.

Given that the problem asks for the radius of the circle, expecting a finite number, and given that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, I think the answer is 9/8.

Therefore, the radius is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the circle is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes, we analyze the images of these axes under the transformation.

### Image of the Real Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \) where \( t \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = t \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i}
   \]
3. **Separating Real and Imaginary Parts**:
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
   This gives the parametric equations:
   \[
   u(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1}, \quad v(t) = \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
4. **Finding the Circle**:
   - By eliminating the parameter \( t \), we find that the image lies on a circle.
   - The circle&#x27;s center is found to be \( (0, -\frac{7}{8}) \) and the radius is calculated as \( \frac{9}{8} \).

### Image of the Imaginary Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = is \) where \( s \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = is \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(is) = \frac{-s + 2}{i(4s + 1)}
   \]
3. **Simplifying**:
   - This results in purely imaginary numbers, indicating the image is a line (the imaginary axis in the complex plane).

### Conclusion
The real axis is mapped to a circle with radius \( \frac{9}{8} \). The imaginary axis is mapped to a line, which in the extended complex plane can be considered a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem specifies a finite radius, so we conclude the radius of the circle onto which the real axis is mapped is the answer.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of the circle that the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes onto. Hmm, bilinear transformations, also known as Möbius transformations, right? They have some properties like mapping circles and lines to circles or lines. Since both the real and imaginary axes are lines in the complex plane, their images under this transformation should be either circles or lines. The problem says &quot;onto the circle,&quot; so I guess both axes are mapped to the same circle? Or maybe each axis is mapped to a circle, and we need to find their radii? Wait, the question says &quot;the circle,&quot; so maybe both are mapped to the same circle? Let me check the wording again: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So, both axes are mapped to the same circle, and we need to find its radius. Alright, that makes sense.

First, let me recall that a bilinear transformation is determined by its action on three points. Also, since it&#x27;s a transformation from the extended complex plane to itself, it can map lines to circles and vice versa. The real and imaginary axes are both lines through the origin, but perpendicular to each other. The transformation \( f(z) \) is given, so maybe I can find images of points on the real axis and the imaginary axis and see what circle they lie on.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the real axis and the imaginary axis, plug them into the transformation, and then find the equation of the image curve, which should be a circle, and then find its radius.

Let me try this approach.

First, let&#x27;s handle the real axis. The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \), where \( t \) is a real number. Then, substitute \( z = t \) into the transformation:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \).

Similarly, the imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = i s \), where \( s \) is a real number. Substituting \( z = i s \):

\( f(i s) = \frac{i (i s) + 2}{4 (i s) + i} = \frac{-s + 2}{4 i s + i} = \frac{(-s + 2)}{i (4 s + 1)} \).

Let me compute both images and see if they lie on the same circle.

Starting with the real axis:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \). Let me write this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let me denote \( f(t) = u + iv \).

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize:

Denominator: \( 4 t + i \), conjugate is \( 4 t - i \).

So,

\( f(t) = \frac{(i t + 2)(4 t - i)}{(4 t + i)(4 t - i)} \).

Compute the denominator first:

\( (4 t)^2 - (i)^2 = 16 t^2 - (-1) = 16 t^2 + 1 \).

Numerator:

Expand \( (i t + 2)(4 t - i) \):

First term: \( i t \cdot 4 t = 4 i t^2 \)

Second term: \( i t \cdot (-i) = -i^2 t = -(-1) t = t \)

Third term: \( 2 \cdot 4 t = 8 t \)

Fourth term: \( 2 \cdot (-i) = -2 i \)

So combining all terms:

\( 4 i t^2 + t + 8 t - 2 i = 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \).

Therefore, the numerator is \( 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \), and the denominator is \( 16 t^2 + 1 \).

So, separating into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( 9 t / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Imaginary part: \( (4 t^2 - 2) / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Therefore, \( f(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \).

So, parametrizing the image of the real axis as \( (u(t), v(t)) \), where:

\( u(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

\( v(t) = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

Now, to find the equation of the circle that these points lie on, I can try to eliminate the parameter \( t \) from the equations for \( u \) and \( v \).

Let me set:

\( u = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (1)

\( v = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (2)

Let me solve equation (1) for \( t \):

From (1):

\( u (16 t^2 + 1) = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 + u = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 - 9 t + u = 0 \)

This is a quadratic equation in \( t \), but maybe it&#x27;s messy to solve for \( t \). Alternatively, let me express \( t \) from equation (1) in terms of \( u \), but it&#x27;s a quadratic, so maybe another approach.

Alternatively, notice that from equation (2), we can express \( 16 t^2 + 1 \) as denominator, so let me denote \( D = 16 t^2 + 1 \). Then:

\( u = 9 t / D \)

\( v = (4 t^2 - 2)/D \)

Then, let&#x27;s compute \( u^2 + v^2 \):

\( u^2 + v^2 = (81 t^2 + (4 t^2 - 2)^2) / D^2 \)

Compute numerator:

\( 81 t^2 + (16 t^4 - 16 t^2 + 4) = 16 t^4 + (81 t^2 - 16 t^2) + 4 = 16 t^4 + 65 t^2 + 4 \)

But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, express \( t \) in terms of \( u \) and substitute into \( v \).

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider that the image lies on a circle, so its equation can be written as \( (u - a)^2 + (v - b)^2 = r^2 \). We need to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( r \).

But since both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to the same circle, we might need to consider points from both images to determine the circle. Alternatively, maybe each axis maps to a circle, and both circles have the same radius? Wait, the problem states &quot;the circle&quot;, so perhaps both axes are mapped to the same circle. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the image of each axis is a circle, and we have to find the radius of each? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes,&quot; which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle, so their images coincide as a circle. Let me check with specific points.

First, check some points on the real axis and see where they are mapped.

Take z = 0 (on real axis): f(0) = (i*0 + 2)/(4*0 + i) = 2 / i = -2i.

Take z = ∞ (on extended real axis): The limit as t approaches ∞ of f(t) = (i t + 2)/(4 t + i) ≈ (i t)/(4 t) = i/4. So f(∞) = i/4.

Take z = 1: f(1) = (i + 2)/(4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 - i):

Numerator: (i + 2)(4 - i) = 4i - i^2 + 8 - 2i = (4i - 2i) + ( -i^2 +8 ) = 2i + 1 +8 = 2i +9

Denominator: (4 + i)(4 - i) = 16 - i^2 = 17

Thus, f(1) = (9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (9/17, 2/17)

Similarly, take z = -1: f(-1) = (-i + 2)/(-4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (-4 - i):

Numerator: (-i + 2)(-4 - i) = (-i)(-4) + (-i)(-i) + 2*(-4) + 2*(-i) = 4i + i^2 -8 -2i = (4i - 2i) + (-1 -8) = 2i -9

Denominator: (-4 + i)(-4 -i) = 16 - (i)^2 = 17

Thus, f(-1) = (-9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (-9/17, 2/17)

So these points are on the image of the real axis. Similarly, the points when z approaches 0 and ∞ are -2i and i/4. So plotting these points: -2i, i/4, (9/17, 2/17), (-9/17, 2/17). Hmm, these points seem to lie on a circle. Let&#x27;s check if they lie on the same circle.

First, let&#x27;s check if points -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17) lie on a circle.

A circle in the complex plane can be represented as |w - c| = r, where c is the center and r is the radius.

Let me consider three points: -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17).

First, represent these points in coordinates:

-2i is (0, -2)

i/4 is (0, 1/4)

(9/17, 2/17) is (9/17, 2/17)

So, three points: (0, -2), (0, 1/4), (9/17, 2/17)

We need to find the circle passing through these three points.

Let me denote the circle equation as \( (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Plugging in the three points:

1. For (0, -2):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (-2 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

2. For (0, 1/4):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (1/4 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

3. For (9/17, 2/17):

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

\( [a^2 + (b + 2)^2] - [a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( (b + 2)^2 - (b - 1/4)^2 = 0 \)

Expand both squares:

\( [b^2 +4b +4] - [b^2 - (1/2)b + 1/16] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( b^2 +4b +4 -b^2 + (1/2)b -1/16 = 0 \)

Combine like terms:

\( (4b + (1/2)b) + (4 - 1/16) = 0 \)

\( (9/2)b + (63/16) = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:

\( 72b + 63 = 0 \)

=&gt; 72b = -63 =&gt; b = -63/72 = -7/8

So, the y-coordinate of the center is -7/8.

Now, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 1:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 + 2 = -7/8 + 16/8 = 9/8

So,

\( a^2 + (9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Similarly, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 2:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 - 2/8 = -9/8

Thus,

\( a^2 + (-9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; same as above, so no new information.

Now, use equation 3 with b = -7/8:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - (-7/8))^2 = r^2 \)

First, compute 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16/136 + 119/136) = 135/136

So,

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = r^2 \)

We also have from equation 1: \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Set them equal:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Expand the left side:

\( (81/289 - (18/17)a + a^2) + (18225/18496) = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Simplify:

\( a^2 - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Cancel \( a^2 \):

\( - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = 81/64 \)

Multiply all terms by 18496 (which is 17^2 * 16^2) to eliminate denominators:

Let&#x27;s compute each term:

- (18/17)a * 18496 = -18 * 18496 /17 * a = -18*1088*a = -19584 a

81/289 *18496 = 81 * (18496 /289) = 81 * 64 = 5184

18225/18496 *18496 = 18225

81/64 *18496 = 81 * 18496 /64 = 81 * 289 = 23409

So the equation becomes:

-19584a + 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Compute 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Thus:

-19584a + 23409 = 23409

Subtract 23409:

-19584a = 0 =&gt; a = 0

Therefore, the center is at (0, -7/8) and radius squared is \( a^2 + 81/64 = 81/64 \), so radius is 9/8.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Wait, but let&#x27;s check if the point (9/17, 2/17) lies on this circle.

Center is (0, -7/8), radius 9/8.

Compute distance from (9/17, 2/17) to (0, -7/8):

Difference in x: 9/17 - 0 = 9/17

Difference in y: 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16 + 119)/136 = 135/136

Compute the distance squared:

(9/17)^2 + (135/136)^2

= 81/289 + 18225/18496

Convert to common denominator:

81/289 = (81 * 64)/ (289 * 64) = 5184/18496

18225/18496

Sum: 5184 + 18225 = 23409 /18496 = (153)^2 / (136)^2 = (153/136)^2

But 153 = 9*17, 136 = 8*17, so 153/136 = 9/8. Hence, distance squared is (9/8)^2, so distance is 9/8, which matches the radius. So, yes, the point is on the circle.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Now, let&#x27;s check the image of the imaginary axis. Earlier, we parametrized z = i s, so:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } \)

Let me simplify this expression.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s + 1)(-i) } \)

Wait, denominator: i*(4s +1)*(-i) = -i^2*(4s +1) = (1)*(4s +1) = 4s +1.

Numerator: (-s + 2)(-i) = (s - 2)i

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \)

So, written as \( u + iv \), this is:

\( u = 0 \), \( v = \frac{ s - 2 }{ 4s +1 } \)

Wait, hold on: Wait, if \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then the real part is 0 and the imaginary part is \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), right? Because multiplying by i gives a purely imaginary number.

Wait, but no: Let me check again. If we have \( \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then that&#x27;s equal to \( i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is a purely imaginary number. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points \( 0 + i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is the imaginary axis in the complex plane? But parametrized by s. Wait, but s is real, except when 4s +1 =0, i.e., s = -1/4, which would be a point at infinity.

But hold on, the image is a subset of the imaginary axis? But that can&#x27;t be, since the problem states that the transformation maps the axes to a circle. But according to this, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let&#x27;s recast the computation of f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis.

Given \( z = i s \), then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i} = \frac{ -s + 2 }{4i s + i } \)

Factor out i from the denominator:

\( \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } = \frac{ (-s + 2) }{i (4 s + 1)} \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1) } \)

Because denominator: \( i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1 \), so denominator becomes \( (4 s +1) \)

So, numerator is \( (s - 2)i \), so \( f(z) = \frac{(s - 2)i}{4 s +1 } \)

Therefore, this is a purely imaginary number scaled by \( \frac{(s - 2)}{4 s +1 } \). So the image is the imaginary axis? But parametrized with a real parameter s. Wait, but except when 4 s +1 =0, which would be s = -1/4, but as s approaches -1/4, the image goes to infinity.

But the imaginary axis is a line, not a circle. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. But since bilinear transformations map circles and lines to circles or lines, the image of the imaginary axis under this transformation is either a line or a circle. But according to this computation, it&#x27;s the imaginary axis, which is a line. But the problem states that it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So if the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line, then they can&#x27;t both be mapped to the same circle. But according to the problem statement, it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle onto which both axes are mapped. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my computation.

Wait, let&#x27;s re-examine the transformation. The transformation is \( f(z) = \frac{ i z + 2 }{4 z + i } \). Let me check if it&#x27;s invertible. The determinant of the coefficients matrix is (i)(i) - (2)(4) = (-1) - 8 = -9 ≠ 0, so it&#x27;s invertible.

Wait, when I computed the image of the imaginary axis, I substituted z = i s and found that f(z) is purely imaginary. But that would imply the image is the imaginary axis, but that contradicts the problem&#x27;s statement. Hmm. So perhaps my error is in the calculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s recompute the image of z = i s:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i } \)

Compute numerator: \( i^2 s + 2 = -s + 2 \)

Denominator: \( 4i s + i = i(4 s +1 ) \)

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i(4 s + 1) } \)

To express this in terms of real and imaginary parts, we can multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i(4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1 ) } \)

Since the denominator was multiplied by -i, which is the conjugate of i, to make it real.

Thus, the result is \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s +1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). So, as s varies over real numbers (excluding s = -1/4), the image is all purely imaginary numbers except when s approaches -1/4, which would approach infinity.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under f(z) is the imaginary axis in the w-plane, plus the point at infinity. But in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem states that both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to a circle. But according to the computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8 and center at (0, -7/8), while the imaginary axis is mapped to the imaginary line (which is a circle through infinity). Therefore, there must be an error here.

But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;. Maybe the problem is that in the finite plane, the image of the imaginary axis is a line, but perhaps when considering the extended complex plane, the line together with the point at infinity forms a circle. However, in that case, the radius would be infinite, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I have a miscalculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s check with specific points on the imaginary axis.

Take z = 0 (on imaginary axis? Wait, z=0 is on both axes, but in the parametrization z = i s, when s = 0, we get z=0. Then f(0) = 2/i = -2i, which is the same as before.

Take z = i (s=1): f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

Take z = 2i (s=2): f(2i) = (i*2i + 2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 + 2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) = 0.

Take z = i/2 (s=1/2): f(i/2) = (i*(i/2) +2)/(4*(i/2) +i) = (-1/2 + 2)/(2i +i) = (3/2)/(3i) = (3/2)/(3i) = 1/(2i) = -i/2.

Take z approaching infinity along the imaginary axis: s approaches infinity, so f(z) = ( -s + 2 ) / (4i s +i ) ≈ -s / 4i s = -1/(4i) = i/4.

So the images are: -2i, -i/5, 0, -i/2, and i/4. These points are all on the imaginary axis. So when s approaches infinity, f(z) approaches i/4, which is a finite point. When s approaches -1/4, the denominator 4s +1 approaches zero, so f(z) approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which in the extended complex plane is a circle. But in the standard complex plane, it&#x27;s a line. However, since Möbius transformations map lines to circles or lines, depending on whether they pass through the pole of the transformation.

But in our case, the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is not on the imaginary axis (since the imaginary axis is z = iy, and -i/4 is on the imaginary axis). Wait, z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis. Wait, the denominator 4z +i =0 when z = -i/4. Therefore, the point z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, and thus the transformation has a pole there. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation should be a circle, because the pole is on the original axis, so the image is a circle.

But according to the previous computation, the image seems to be the entire imaginary axis. But that contradicts. Wait, perhaps there&#x27;s a mistake here.

Wait, if the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is on the imaginary axis, then the image of the imaginary axis should be a circle in the extended complex plane. However, when we parameterized it, we obtained the entire imaginary axis except for the point at s = -1/4, which maps to infinity. Therefore, in the extended complex plane, the image is the imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which is a &quot;circle&quot; passing through infinity, i.e., a line. But according to Möbius transformation properties, if the original line passes through the pole, then the image is a line; otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle. Wait, maybe that&#x27;s the key.

Wait, the general property is that Möbius transformations map circles and lines to circles and lines. A line can be considered a circle passing through infinity. If the original line passes through the pole of the transformation (the point where the denominator is zero), then the image will pass through infinity, hence it&#x27;s a line. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle.

In our case, the real axis does not pass through the pole z = -i/4, since the pole is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle. The imaginary axis does pass through the pole z = -i/4, so its image is a line (the extended line, i.e., a circle passing through infinity).

But the problem states that the transformation maps both the real and imaginary axes onto the same circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Therefore, either the problem is ill-posed, or my computations are wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the image of each axis separately, and both images are circles, but with the same radius? Let me check again.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute the image of the imaginary axis again more carefully.

Parametrizing z = i s, then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (2 - s) }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(z) = \frac{ (2 - s)(-i) }{ (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ 4 s + 1 } \)

Thus, this is equal to \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s + 1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). Therefore, as s varies over ℝ \ { -1/4 }, the image is all imaginary numbers. However, when s approaches -1/4, the denominator approaches zero, so the image approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the extended imaginary axis (including infinity), which is a line in the extended complex plane. But the problem says it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle, which suggests a finite circle.

But according to my previous calculation, the image of the real axis is a circle with radius 9/8. However, the problem mentions &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle. But according to my computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misstated, or I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check another point on the imaginary axis. Take z = -i/4, which is the pole. But z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so it&#x27;s mapped to infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line plus infinity, which is a line in the extended plane. So that can&#x27;t be a circle. However, the problem says &quot;onto the circle&quot;, so maybe the question is actually only referring to the real axis? Or maybe the problem is in error.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation when considering the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s consider another approach. Let&#x27;s suppose that both images are circles. Wait, but we saw that the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line. However, maybe in the extended plane, the line is considered a circle, but the problem is asking for the radius in the standard plane, so only the real axis&#x27;s image is a circle with finite radius, and the imaginary axis&#x27;s image is a line, which has infinite radius. But the problem says &quot;the circle&quot;, so maybe the answer is 9/8, the radius from the real axis image.

But the problem states: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; If both axes are mapped to the same circle, but our calculation shows that the real axis is mapped to a circle and the imaginary axis to a line, there&#x27;s a problem. Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s try parametrizing the image of the imaginary axis again. Suppose I write w = f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis, so z = iy, y ∈ ℝ.

Then, w = (i*(iy) + 2)/(4*(iy) + i) = (-y + 2)/(4iy + i) = (2 - y)/(i(4y +1)).

Let me write w = u + iv.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

w = (2 - y)(-i)/(i(4y +1)(-i)) = (-i(2 - y))/( (4y +1) )

The denominator simplifies to (4y +1) because i*(-i) = 1.

Therefore, w = -i(2 - y)/(4y +1 ) = [ (y - 2)/(4y +1) ] i.

So, w is purely imaginary, with v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ), and u = 0.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ) for real y ≠ -1/4.

To see if this is a circle, we can parametrize v in terms of y:

Let me set t = y, then v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

This is a hyperbola or a straight line?

Wait, solving for t:

v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

Multiply both sides by (4t +1):

v(4t +1 ) = t -2

4v t + v = t -2

4v t - t = -2 - v

t(4v -1 ) = - (2 + v )

Therefore,

t = - (2 + v ) / (4v -1 )

This shows that for each v ≠ 1/4, there&#x27;s a corresponding t. But this parametrization covers all real numbers except v = 1/4, which would require the denominator 4v -1 =0, i.e., v=1/4. When v approaches 1/4, t approaches infinity.

But the image is the set of all points (0, v) where v can be any real number except v=1/4. Wait, but in reality, when t approaches infinity, v = (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t/(4t ) = 1/4. So, as t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4 from below. Similarly, when t approaches -1/4 from the right, denominator approaches zero, and v approaches ± infinity depending on the direction.

Wait, let&#x27;s analyze the function v(t) = (t -2)/(4t +1 )

Find the range of v(t):

As t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4.

As t approaches -1/4 from above, denominator approaches 0+, numerator approaches (-1/4 - 2 )= -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0+ = -infty.

As t approaches -1/4 from below, denominator approaches 0-, numerator approaches -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0- = +infty.

At t = 2, v=0.

Therefore, the function v(t) maps:

t ∈ (-∞, -1/4 ) to v ∈ (1/4, +infty ) (wait, hold on):

Wait, let&#x27;s check:

For t &lt; -1/4:

Denominator 4t +1 &lt; 0.

Numerator t -2: If t approaches -infty, t -2 approaches -infty.

So for t &lt; -1/4:

v = (negative)/(negative) = positive.

As t approaches -infty, v ≈ t /4t = 1/4. So from above.

Wait, as t approaches -infty, (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t /4t = 1/4, approaching 1/4 from above? Wait:

Let me compute the limit as t approaches -infty:

(t -2)/(4t +1 ) = [ t (1 - 2/t ) ] / [ t (4 + 1/t ) ] = (1 - 0)/(4 +0 ) = 1/4. So as t approaches -infty, v approaches 1/4 from above (since numerator is negative and denominator is negative, making positive, and when t approaches -infty, the difference from 1/4 is positive). Wait, not sure. Let me plug in t = -N where N is a large positive number:

v = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (N +2)/(4N -1 ) ≈ N /4N = 1/4. So approaching 1/4 from above? Let&#x27;s compute for large N:

(N +2)/(4N -1 ) = [N(1 + 2/N )]/[N(4 -1/N ) ] = (1 + 2/N )/(4 -1/N ) ≈ (1 +0 )/(4 -0 ) = 1/4. So as N increases, the value approaches 1/4 from slightly above? Let&#x27;s take N=1000:

(1000 +2 )/(4000 -1 ) = 1002/3999 ≈ 0.2506, which is slightly more than 1/4. So yes, approaches 1/4 from above.

Similarly, for t approaching -1/4 from the left (t approaching -1/4- ):

t approaching -1/4 from below (t = -1/4 - ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 - ε -2 ) = -9/4 - ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 - ε ) +1 = -1 -4ε +1 = -4ε

So v = (-9/4 - ε )/(-4ε ) = (9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (9/4)/4ε = 9/(16ε ), which approaches +infty as ε→0+.

For t approaching -1/4 from the right (t = -1/4 + ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 + ε -2 ) = -9/4 + ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 + ε ) +1 = -1 +4ε +1 = 4ε

v = (-9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (-9/4)/4ε = -9/(16ε ), which approaches -infty as ε→0+.

At t = 2: v=0.

Therefore, the range of v(t) is:

- When t ∈ (-infty, -1/4 ), v ∈ (1/4, +infty )

- When t ∈ (-1/4, ∞ ), v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 )

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 ) ∪ (1/4, +infty ), i.e., the entire imaginary axis except the point v=1/4. But in the extended complex plane, we include infinity, so the image is the entire imaginary axis (as a line), which makes sense because the pole at z=-i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so the image is a line.

But according to the problem statement, we should map both axes to a circle. This suggests a discrepancy. However, earlier computation showed that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I misinterpreted it. Maybe it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle that the real axis is mapped to, and separately the radius for the imaginary axis? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which seems to imply a single circle. But according to my calculations, they are mapped to different circles (one a finite circle, one a line). This is confusing.

Wait, maybe there&#x27;s a mistake in the computation for the image of the imaginary axis. Let me try a different approach. Instead of parametrizing z = i s, perhaps I should consider the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation f(z) and see if it can be represented as a circle.

The general method for finding the image of a line under a Möbius transformation is to take three points on the original line, find their images, and then determine the circle or line through those points.

Let&#x27;s apply this method to the imaginary axis.

Take three points on the imaginary axis:

1. z = 0: f(0) = 2/i = -2i.

2. z = i: f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

3. z = ∞: The transformation as z approaches ∞ along the imaginary axis: f(z) = (i*z + 2)/(4*z + i) ≈ (i*z)/(4*z) = i/4.

So the three image points are -2i, -i/5, and i/4.

These three points are on the imaginary axis. To determine if they lie on a circle, note that three colinear points (on the same line) lie on an infinite number of circles, but in the standard plane, the only circle that includes them is the line itself, considered as a circle with infinite radius. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line, which is a &quot;circle&quot; with infinite radius. But the problem asks for the radius of the circle, which is finite. Therefore, this suggests that only the real axis is mapped to a circle with finite radius, and the answer should be 9/8.

However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the circle, which contradicts our findings. Therefore, perhaps there&#x27;s an error in the problem or in my solution.

Wait, let&#x27;s cross-verify the image of the real axis. We found that it&#x27;s a circle with center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. Let me check if the images of the real axis include points from the imaginary axis&#x27;s image. For example, take z =0 (on both axes), maps to -2i, which is on the circle (distance from center (0, -7/8) to -2i (0, -2) is | -2 - (-7/8)| = |-16/8 +7/8| = |-9/8| = 9/8, which is the radius. So yes, -2i is on the circle. The point at infinity maps to i/4, which is also on the circle: center (0, -7/8), distance to i/4 (0, 1/4) is |1/4 - (-7/8)| = |1/4 +7/8| = |9/8| =9/8, which is the radius. The images of the real axis include points like i/4 and -2i, which are also images of points on the imaginary axis. Wait, hold on. The image of the real axis includes the point -2i (image of z=0) and i/4 (image of z=∞), which are also images of points on the imaginary axis (z=0 and z=∞). Similarly, images of the imaginary axis include -2i, which is also on the real axis&#x27;s image. Wait, but the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, but the circle we found for the real axis&#x27;s image includes some points on the imaginary axis. Specifically, the circle intersects the imaginary axis at -2i and i/4. But the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, which includes these two points. Therefore, perhaps the problem is referring to the circle that is the image of the real axis, and the image of the imaginary axis is the line that coincides with the imaginary axis, intersecting the circle at -2i and i/4. However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the same circle. Since the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line intersecting that circle at two points, but not the entire circle. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my previous reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary line. Let me check with another point.

Take z = 2i (s=2). Then f(2i) = (i*2i +2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 +2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) =0, which is on the real axis&#x27;s image circle? Let&#x27;s check. The circle has center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. The point 0 is at (0,0). The distance from (0,0) to (0, -7/8) is 7/8, which is less than 9/8, so 0 is inside the circle. Wait, but 0 is the image of z=2i, which is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, 0 is inside the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis includes points inside the circle. But the image of the real axis is the circle itself. So the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary axis, which intersects the circle at -2i and i/4, and passes through 0 inside the circle. Therefore, the two images are different: one is a circle, the other is a line intersecting the circle. So the problem statement must be incorrect, or I have a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem is to find the radius of the circle that both axes are mapped to, implying that both images coincide. In that case, my previous calculation must be wrong.

Wait, let&#x27;s see. The transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let me check if it&#x27;s an involution or has some symmetry. Let me compute f(f(z)):

Compute f(f(z)):

First, f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let&#x27;s substitute w = f(z):

f(w) = (i w +2 )/(4 w +i )

Substitute w = (i z +2)/(4 z +i ):

= [ i*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +2 ] / [4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ]

Simplify numerator:

[ (i^2 z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2 ] = [ (-z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2*(4 z +i )/(4 z +i ) ]

= [ (-z + 2i +8 z +2i )/(4 z +i ) ] = [7 z +4i )/(4 z +i )

Denominator:

[4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ] = [4i z +8 +i*(4 z +i ) ]/(4 z +i )

= [4i z +8 +4i z +i^2 ]/(4 z +i )

= [8i z +8 -1 ]/(4 z +i )

= (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i )

Therefore, f(f(z)) = [ (7 z +4i )/(4 z +i ) ] / [ (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i ) ] = (7 z +4i )/(8i z +7 )

This is not equal to z, so f is not an involution. Therefore, there&#x27;s no immediate symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation maps both axes to the same circle due to some symmetry. But my previous computations do not support this. The real axis maps to a circle, and the imaginary axis maps to a line. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in my solution.

Alternatively, maybe the question is to find the radius for each axis separately. For the real axis, we have radius 9/8. For the imaginary axis, since it&#x27;s mapped to a line, which can be thought of as a circle with infinite radius, but the problem asks for a finite radius. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 9/8.

Given the problem&#x27;s wording, and since the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line (infinite radius), but the problem mentions &quot;the circle&quot;, likely referring to the real axis&#x27;s image, which is a finite circle, the answer should be 9/8.

But to confirm, let&#x27;s see if any other references or methods can show that both images are the same circle.

Alternatively, suppose we consider the transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i )

Let me check if it maps the real axis to a circle and the imaginary axis to the same circle.

From previous calculations, the real axis maps to a circle with center (0, -7/8 ) and radius 9/8. The imaginary axis maps to the imaginary line, which intersects this circle at -2i and i/4. The points -2i and i/4 are both on the circle, as:

Distance from -2i (0, -2) to center (0, -7/8 ) is | -2 - (-7/8 ) | = |-9/8 | =9/8.

Distance from i/4 (0, 1/4 ) to center (0, -7/8 ) is |1/4 - (-7/8 ) | = |9/8 | =9/8.

But the rest of the imaginary axis is not on the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis is the line passing through -2i and i/4 and extending to infinity, which is the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is not the same as the image of the real axis, unless we consider the extended line as a circle, which has infinite radius.

Given that the problem asks for the radius of the circle, expecting a finite number, and given that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, I think the answer is 9/8.

Therefore, the radius is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the circle is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes, we analyze the images of these axes under the transformation.

### Image of the Real Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \) where \( t \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = t \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i}
   \]
3. **Separating Real and Imaginary Parts**:
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
   This gives the parametric equations:
   \[
   u(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1}, \quad v(t) = \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
4. **Finding the Circle**:
   - By eliminating the parameter \( t \), we find that the image lies on a circle.
   - The circle&#x27;s center is found to be \( (0, -\frac{7}{8}) \) and the radius is calculated as \( \frac{9}{8} \).

### Image of the Imaginary Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = is \) where \( s \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = is \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(is) = \frac{-s + 2}{i(4s + 1)}
   \]
3. **Simplifying**:
   - This results in purely imaginary numbers, indicating the image is a line (the imaginary axis in the complex plane).

### Conclusion
The real axis is mapped to a circle with radius \( \frac{9}{8} \). The imaginary axis is mapped to a line, which in the extended complex plane can be considered a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem specifies a finite radius, so we conclude the radius of the circle onto which the real axis is mapped is the answer.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of the circle that the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes onto. Hmm, bilinear transformations, also known as Möbius transformations, right? They have some properties like mapping circles and lines to circles or lines. Since both the real and imaginary axes are lines in the complex plane, their images under this transformation should be either circles or lines. The problem says &quot;onto the circle,&quot; so I guess both axes are mapped to the same circle? Or maybe each axis is mapped to a circle, and we need to find their radii? Wait, the question says &quot;the circle,&quot; so maybe both are mapped to the same circle? Let me check the wording again: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So, both axes are mapped to the same circle, and we need to find its radius. Alright, that makes sense.

First, let me recall that a bilinear transformation is determined by its action on three points. Also, since it&#x27;s a transformation from the extended complex plane to itself, it can map lines to circles and vice versa. The real and imaginary axes are both lines through the origin, but perpendicular to each other. The transformation \( f(z) \) is given, so maybe I can find images of points on the real axis and the imaginary axis and see what circle they lie on.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the real axis and the imaginary axis, plug them into the transformation, and then find the equation of the image curve, which should be a circle, and then find its radius.

Let me try this approach.

First, let&#x27;s handle the real axis. The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \), where \( t \) is a real number. Then, substitute \( z = t \) into the transformation:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \).

Similarly, the imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = i s \), where \( s \) is a real number. Substituting \( z = i s \):

\( f(i s) = \frac{i (i s) + 2}{4 (i s) + i} = \frac{-s + 2}{4 i s + i} = \frac{(-s + 2)}{i (4 s + 1)} \).

Let me compute both images and see if they lie on the same circle.

Starting with the real axis:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \). Let me write this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let me denote \( f(t) = u + iv \).

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize:

Denominator: \( 4 t + i \), conjugate is \( 4 t - i \).

So,

\( f(t) = \frac{(i t + 2)(4 t - i)}{(4 t + i)(4 t - i)} \).

Compute the denominator first:

\( (4 t)^2 - (i)^2 = 16 t^2 - (-1) = 16 t^2 + 1 \).

Numerator:

Expand \( (i t + 2)(4 t - i) \):

First term: \( i t \cdot 4 t = 4 i t^2 \)

Second term: \( i t \cdot (-i) = -i^2 t = -(-1) t = t \)

Third term: \( 2 \cdot 4 t = 8 t \)

Fourth term: \( 2 \cdot (-i) = -2 i \)

So combining all terms:

\( 4 i t^2 + t + 8 t - 2 i = 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \).

Therefore, the numerator is \( 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \), and the denominator is \( 16 t^2 + 1 \).

So, separating into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( 9 t / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Imaginary part: \( (4 t^2 - 2) / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Therefore, \( f(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \).

So, parametrizing the image of the real axis as \( (u(t), v(t)) \), where:

\( u(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

\( v(t) = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

Now, to find the equation of the circle that these points lie on, I can try to eliminate the parameter \( t \) from the equations for \( u \) and \( v \).

Let me set:

\( u = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (1)

\( v = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (2)

Let me solve equation (1) for \( t \):

From (1):

\( u (16 t^2 + 1) = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 + u = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 - 9 t + u = 0 \)

This is a quadratic equation in \( t \), but maybe it&#x27;s messy to solve for \( t \). Alternatively, let me express \( t \) from equation (1) in terms of \( u \), but it&#x27;s a quadratic, so maybe another approach.

Alternatively, notice that from equation (2), we can express \( 16 t^2 + 1 \) as denominator, so let me denote \( D = 16 t^2 + 1 \). Then:

\( u = 9 t / D \)

\( v = (4 t^2 - 2)/D \)

Then, let&#x27;s compute \( u^2 + v^2 \):

\( u^2 + v^2 = (81 t^2 + (4 t^2 - 2)^2) / D^2 \)

Compute numerator:

\( 81 t^2 + (16 t^4 - 16 t^2 + 4) = 16 t^4 + (81 t^2 - 16 t^2) + 4 = 16 t^4 + 65 t^2 + 4 \)

But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, express \( t \) in terms of \( u \) and substitute into \( v \).

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider that the image lies on a circle, so its equation can be written as \( (u - a)^2 + (v - b)^2 = r^2 \). We need to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( r \).

But since both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to the same circle, we might need to consider points from both images to determine the circle. Alternatively, maybe each axis maps to a circle, and both circles have the same radius? Wait, the problem states &quot;the circle&quot;, so perhaps both axes are mapped to the same circle. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the image of each axis is a circle, and we have to find the radius of each? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes,&quot; which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle, so their images coincide as a circle. Let me check with specific points.

First, check some points on the real axis and see where they are mapped.

Take z = 0 (on real axis): f(0) = (i*0 + 2)/(4*0 + i) = 2 / i = -2i.

Take z = ∞ (on extended real axis): The limit as t approaches ∞ of f(t) = (i t + 2)/(4 t + i) ≈ (i t)/(4 t) = i/4. So f(∞) = i/4.

Take z = 1: f(1) = (i + 2)/(4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 - i):

Numerator: (i + 2)(4 - i) = 4i - i^2 + 8 - 2i = (4i - 2i) + ( -i^2 +8 ) = 2i + 1 +8 = 2i +9

Denominator: (4 + i)(4 - i) = 16 - i^2 = 17

Thus, f(1) = (9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (9/17, 2/17)

Similarly, take z = -1: f(-1) = (-i + 2)/(-4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (-4 - i):

Numerator: (-i + 2)(-4 - i) = (-i)(-4) + (-i)(-i) + 2*(-4) + 2*(-i) = 4i + i^2 -8 -2i = (4i - 2i) + (-1 -8) = 2i -9

Denominator: (-4 + i)(-4 -i) = 16 - (i)^2 = 17

Thus, f(-1) = (-9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (-9/17, 2/17)

So these points are on the image of the real axis. Similarly, the points when z approaches 0 and ∞ are -2i and i/4. So plotting these points: -2i, i/4, (9/17, 2/17), (-9/17, 2/17). Hmm, these points seem to lie on a circle. Let&#x27;s check if they lie on the same circle.

First, let&#x27;s check if points -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17) lie on a circle.

A circle in the complex plane can be represented as |w - c| = r, where c is the center and r is the radius.

Let me consider three points: -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17).

First, represent these points in coordinates:

-2i is (0, -2)

i/4 is (0, 1/4)

(9/17, 2/17) is (9/17, 2/17)

So, three points: (0, -2), (0, 1/4), (9/17, 2/17)

We need to find the circle passing through these three points.

Let me denote the circle equation as \( (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Plugging in the three points:

1. For (0, -2):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (-2 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

2. For (0, 1/4):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (1/4 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

3. For (9/17, 2/17):

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

\( [a^2 + (b + 2)^2] - [a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( (b + 2)^2 - (b - 1/4)^2 = 0 \)

Expand both squares:

\( [b^2 +4b +4] - [b^2 - (1/2)b + 1/16] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( b^2 +4b +4 -b^2 + (1/2)b -1/16 = 0 \)

Combine like terms:

\( (4b + (1/2)b) + (4 - 1/16) = 0 \)

\( (9/2)b + (63/16) = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:

\( 72b + 63 = 0 \)

=&gt; 72b = -63 =&gt; b = -63/72 = -7/8

So, the y-coordinate of the center is -7/8.

Now, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 1:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 + 2 = -7/8 + 16/8 = 9/8

So,

\( a^2 + (9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Similarly, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 2:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 - 2/8 = -9/8

Thus,

\( a^2 + (-9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; same as above, so no new information.

Now, use equation 3 with b = -7/8:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - (-7/8))^2 = r^2 \)

First, compute 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16/136 + 119/136) = 135/136

So,

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = r^2 \)

We also have from equation 1: \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Set them equal:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Expand the left side:

\( (81/289 - (18/17)a + a^2) + (18225/18496) = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Simplify:

\( a^2 - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Cancel \( a^2 \):

\( - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = 81/64 \)

Multiply all terms by 18496 (which is 17^2 * 16^2) to eliminate denominators:

Let&#x27;s compute each term:

- (18/17)a * 18496 = -18 * 18496 /17 * a = -18*1088*a = -19584 a

81/289 *18496 = 81 * (18496 /289) = 81 * 64 = 5184

18225/18496 *18496 = 18225

81/64 *18496 = 81 * 18496 /64 = 81 * 289 = 23409

So the equation becomes:

-19584a + 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Compute 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Thus:

-19584a + 23409 = 23409

Subtract 23409:

-19584a = 0 =&gt; a = 0

Therefore, the center is at (0, -7/8) and radius squared is \( a^2 + 81/64 = 81/64 \), so radius is 9/8.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Wait, but let&#x27;s check if the point (9/17, 2/17) lies on this circle.

Center is (0, -7/8), radius 9/8.

Compute distance from (9/17, 2/17) to (0, -7/8):

Difference in x: 9/17 - 0 = 9/17

Difference in y: 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16 + 119)/136 = 135/136

Compute the distance squared:

(9/17)^2 + (135/136)^2

= 81/289 + 18225/18496

Convert to common denominator:

81/289 = (81 * 64)/ (289 * 64) = 5184/18496

18225/18496

Sum: 5184 + 18225 = 23409 /18496 = (153)^2 / (136)^2 = (153/136)^2

But 153 = 9*17, 136 = 8*17, so 153/136 = 9/8. Hence, distance squared is (9/8)^2, so distance is 9/8, which matches the radius. So, yes, the point is on the circle.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Now, let&#x27;s check the image of the imaginary axis. Earlier, we parametrized z = i s, so:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } \)

Let me simplify this expression.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s + 1)(-i) } \)

Wait, denominator: i*(4s +1)*(-i) = -i^2*(4s +1) = (1)*(4s +1) = 4s +1.

Numerator: (-s + 2)(-i) = (s - 2)i

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \)

So, written as \( u + iv \), this is:

\( u = 0 \), \( v = \frac{ s - 2 }{ 4s +1 } \)

Wait, hold on: Wait, if \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then the real part is 0 and the imaginary part is \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), right? Because multiplying by i gives a purely imaginary number.

Wait, but no: Let me check again. If we have \( \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then that&#x27;s equal to \( i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is a purely imaginary number. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points \( 0 + i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is the imaginary axis in the complex plane? But parametrized by s. Wait, but s is real, except when 4s +1 =0, i.e., s = -1/4, which would be a point at infinity.

But hold on, the image is a subset of the imaginary axis? But that can&#x27;t be, since the problem states that the transformation maps the axes to a circle. But according to this, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let&#x27;s recast the computation of f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis.

Given \( z = i s \), then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i} = \frac{ -s + 2 }{4i s + i } \)

Factor out i from the denominator:

\( \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } = \frac{ (-s + 2) }{i (4 s + 1)} \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1) } \)

Because denominator: \( i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1 \), so denominator becomes \( (4 s +1) \)

So, numerator is \( (s - 2)i \), so \( f(z) = \frac{(s - 2)i}{4 s +1 } \)

Therefore, this is a purely imaginary number scaled by \( \frac{(s - 2)}{4 s +1 } \). So the image is the imaginary axis? But parametrized with a real parameter s. Wait, but except when 4 s +1 =0, which would be s = -1/4, but as s approaches -1/4, the image goes to infinity.

But the imaginary axis is a line, not a circle. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. But since bilinear transformations map circles and lines to circles or lines, the image of the imaginary axis under this transformation is either a line or a circle. But according to this computation, it&#x27;s the imaginary axis, which is a line. But the problem states that it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So if the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line, then they can&#x27;t both be mapped to the same circle. But according to the problem statement, it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle onto which both axes are mapped. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my computation.

Wait, let&#x27;s re-examine the transformation. The transformation is \( f(z) = \frac{ i z + 2 }{4 z + i } \). Let me check if it&#x27;s invertible. The determinant of the coefficients matrix is (i)(i) - (2)(4) = (-1) - 8 = -9 ≠ 0, so it&#x27;s invertible.

Wait, when I computed the image of the imaginary axis, I substituted z = i s and found that f(z) is purely imaginary. But that would imply the image is the imaginary axis, but that contradicts the problem&#x27;s statement. Hmm. So perhaps my error is in the calculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s recompute the image of z = i s:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i } \)

Compute numerator: \( i^2 s + 2 = -s + 2 \)

Denominator: \( 4i s + i = i(4 s +1 ) \)

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i(4 s + 1) } \)

To express this in terms of real and imaginary parts, we can multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i(4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1 ) } \)

Since the denominator was multiplied by -i, which is the conjugate of i, to make it real.

Thus, the result is \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s +1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). So, as s varies over real numbers (excluding s = -1/4), the image is all purely imaginary numbers except when s approaches -1/4, which would approach infinity.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under f(z) is the imaginary axis in the w-plane, plus the point at infinity. But in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem states that both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to a circle. But according to the computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8 and center at (0, -7/8), while the imaginary axis is mapped to the imaginary line (which is a circle through infinity). Therefore, there must be an error here.

But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;. Maybe the problem is that in the finite plane, the image of the imaginary axis is a line, but perhaps when considering the extended complex plane, the line together with the point at infinity forms a circle. However, in that case, the radius would be infinite, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I have a miscalculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s check with specific points on the imaginary axis.

Take z = 0 (on imaginary axis? Wait, z=0 is on both axes, but in the parametrization z = i s, when s = 0, we get z=0. Then f(0) = 2/i = -2i, which is the same as before.

Take z = i (s=1): f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

Take z = 2i (s=2): f(2i) = (i*2i + 2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 + 2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) = 0.

Take z = i/2 (s=1/2): f(i/2) = (i*(i/2) +2)/(4*(i/2) +i) = (-1/2 + 2)/(2i +i) = (3/2)/(3i) = (3/2)/(3i) = 1/(2i) = -i/2.

Take z approaching infinity along the imaginary axis: s approaches infinity, so f(z) = ( -s + 2 ) / (4i s +i ) ≈ -s / 4i s = -1/(4i) = i/4.

So the images are: -2i, -i/5, 0, -i/2, and i/4. These points are all on the imaginary axis. So when s approaches infinity, f(z) approaches i/4, which is a finite point. When s approaches -1/4, the denominator 4s +1 approaches zero, so f(z) approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which in the extended complex plane is a circle. But in the standard complex plane, it&#x27;s a line. However, since Möbius transformations map lines to circles or lines, depending on whether they pass through the pole of the transformation.

But in our case, the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is not on the imaginary axis (since the imaginary axis is z = iy, and -i/4 is on the imaginary axis). Wait, z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis. Wait, the denominator 4z +i =0 when z = -i/4. Therefore, the point z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, and thus the transformation has a pole there. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation should be a circle, because the pole is on the original axis, so the image is a circle.

But according to the previous computation, the image seems to be the entire imaginary axis. But that contradicts. Wait, perhaps there&#x27;s a mistake here.

Wait, if the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is on the imaginary axis, then the image of the imaginary axis should be a circle in the extended complex plane. However, when we parameterized it, we obtained the entire imaginary axis except for the point at s = -1/4, which maps to infinity. Therefore, in the extended complex plane, the image is the imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which is a &quot;circle&quot; passing through infinity, i.e., a line. But according to Möbius transformation properties, if the original line passes through the pole, then the image is a line; otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle. Wait, maybe that&#x27;s the key.

Wait, the general property is that Möbius transformations map circles and lines to circles and lines. A line can be considered a circle passing through infinity. If the original line passes through the pole of the transformation (the point where the denominator is zero), then the image will pass through infinity, hence it&#x27;s a line. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle.

In our case, the real axis does not pass through the pole z = -i/4, since the pole is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle. The imaginary axis does pass through the pole z = -i/4, so its image is a line (the extended line, i.e., a circle passing through infinity).

But the problem states that the transformation maps both the real and imaginary axes onto the same circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Therefore, either the problem is ill-posed, or my computations are wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the image of each axis separately, and both images are circles, but with the same radius? Let me check again.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute the image of the imaginary axis again more carefully.

Parametrizing z = i s, then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (2 - s) }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(z) = \frac{ (2 - s)(-i) }{ (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ 4 s + 1 } \)

Thus, this is equal to \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s + 1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). Therefore, as s varies over ℝ \ { -1/4 }, the image is all imaginary numbers. However, when s approaches -1/4, the denominator approaches zero, so the image approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the extended imaginary axis (including infinity), which is a line in the extended complex plane. But the problem says it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle, which suggests a finite circle.

But according to my previous calculation, the image of the real axis is a circle with radius 9/8. However, the problem mentions &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle. But according to my computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misstated, or I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check another point on the imaginary axis. Take z = -i/4, which is the pole. But z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so it&#x27;s mapped to infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line plus infinity, which is a line in the extended plane. So that can&#x27;t be a circle. However, the problem says &quot;onto the circle&quot;, so maybe the question is actually only referring to the real axis? Or maybe the problem is in error.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation when considering the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s consider another approach. Let&#x27;s suppose that both images are circles. Wait, but we saw that the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line. However, maybe in the extended plane, the line is considered a circle, but the problem is asking for the radius in the standard plane, so only the real axis&#x27;s image is a circle with finite radius, and the imaginary axis&#x27;s image is a line, which has infinite radius. But the problem says &quot;the circle&quot;, so maybe the answer is 9/8, the radius from the real axis image.

But the problem states: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; If both axes are mapped to the same circle, but our calculation shows that the real axis is mapped to a circle and the imaginary axis to a line, there&#x27;s a problem. Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s try parametrizing the image of the imaginary axis again. Suppose I write w = f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis, so z = iy, y ∈ ℝ.

Then, w = (i*(iy) + 2)/(4*(iy) + i) = (-y + 2)/(4iy + i) = (2 - y)/(i(4y +1)).

Let me write w = u + iv.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

w = (2 - y)(-i)/(i(4y +1)(-i)) = (-i(2 - y))/( (4y +1) )

The denominator simplifies to (4y +1) because i*(-i) = 1.

Therefore, w = -i(2 - y)/(4y +1 ) = [ (y - 2)/(4y +1) ] i.

So, w is purely imaginary, with v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ), and u = 0.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ) for real y ≠ -1/4.

To see if this is a circle, we can parametrize v in terms of y:

Let me set t = y, then v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

This is a hyperbola or a straight line?

Wait, solving for t:

v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

Multiply both sides by (4t +1):

v(4t +1 ) = t -2

4v t + v = t -2

4v t - t = -2 - v

t(4v -1 ) = - (2 + v )

Therefore,

t = - (2 + v ) / (4v -1 )

This shows that for each v ≠ 1/4, there&#x27;s a corresponding t. But this parametrization covers all real numbers except v = 1/4, which would require the denominator 4v -1 =0, i.e., v=1/4. When v approaches 1/4, t approaches infinity.

But the image is the set of all points (0, v) where v can be any real number except v=1/4. Wait, but in reality, when t approaches infinity, v = (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t/(4t ) = 1/4. So, as t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4 from below. Similarly, when t approaches -1/4 from the right, denominator approaches zero, and v approaches ± infinity depending on the direction.

Wait, let&#x27;s analyze the function v(t) = (t -2)/(4t +1 )

Find the range of v(t):

As t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4.

As t approaches -1/4 from above, denominator approaches 0+, numerator approaches (-1/4 - 2 )= -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0+ = -infty.

As t approaches -1/4 from below, denominator approaches 0-, numerator approaches -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0- = +infty.

At t = 2, v=0.

Therefore, the function v(t) maps:

t ∈ (-∞, -1/4 ) to v ∈ (1/4, +infty ) (wait, hold on):

Wait, let&#x27;s check:

For t &lt; -1/4:

Denominator 4t +1 &lt; 0.

Numerator t -2: If t approaches -infty, t -2 approaches -infty.

So for t &lt; -1/4:

v = (negative)/(negative) = positive.

As t approaches -infty, v ≈ t /4t = 1/4. So from above.

Wait, as t approaches -infty, (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t /4t = 1/4, approaching 1/4 from above? Wait:

Let me compute the limit as t approaches -infty:

(t -2)/(4t +1 ) = [ t (1 - 2/t ) ] / [ t (4 + 1/t ) ] = (1 - 0)/(4 +0 ) = 1/4. So as t approaches -infty, v approaches 1/4 from above (since numerator is negative and denominator is negative, making positive, and when t approaches -infty, the difference from 1/4 is positive). Wait, not sure. Let me plug in t = -N where N is a large positive number:

v = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (N +2)/(4N -1 ) ≈ N /4N = 1/4. So approaching 1/4 from above? Let&#x27;s compute for large N:

(N +2)/(4N -1 ) = [N(1 + 2/N )]/[N(4 -1/N ) ] = (1 + 2/N )/(4 -1/N ) ≈ (1 +0 )/(4 -0 ) = 1/4. So as N increases, the value approaches 1/4 from slightly above? Let&#x27;s take N=1000:

(1000 +2 )/(4000 -1 ) = 1002/3999 ≈ 0.2506, which is slightly more than 1/4. So yes, approaches 1/4 from above.

Similarly, for t approaching -1/4 from the left (t approaching -1/4- ):

t approaching -1/4 from below (t = -1/4 - ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 - ε -2 ) = -9/4 - ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 - ε ) +1 = -1 -4ε +1 = -4ε

So v = (-9/4 - ε )/(-4ε ) = (9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (9/4)/4ε = 9/(16ε ), which approaches +infty as ε→0+.

For t approaching -1/4 from the right (t = -1/4 + ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 + ε -2 ) = -9/4 + ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 + ε ) +1 = -1 +4ε +1 = 4ε

v = (-9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (-9/4)/4ε = -9/(16ε ), which approaches -infty as ε→0+.

At t = 2: v=0.

Therefore, the range of v(t) is:

- When t ∈ (-infty, -1/4 ), v ∈ (1/4, +infty )

- When t ∈ (-1/4, ∞ ), v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 )

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 ) ∪ (1/4, +infty ), i.e., the entire imaginary axis except the point v=1/4. But in the extended complex plane, we include infinity, so the image is the entire imaginary axis (as a line), which makes sense because the pole at z=-i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so the image is a line.

But according to the problem statement, we should map both axes to a circle. This suggests a discrepancy. However, earlier computation showed that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I misinterpreted it. Maybe it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle that the real axis is mapped to, and separately the radius for the imaginary axis? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which seems to imply a single circle. But according to my calculations, they are mapped to different circles (one a finite circle, one a line). This is confusing.

Wait, maybe there&#x27;s a mistake in the computation for the image of the imaginary axis. Let me try a different approach. Instead of parametrizing z = i s, perhaps I should consider the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation f(z) and see if it can be represented as a circle.

The general method for finding the image of a line under a Möbius transformation is to take three points on the original line, find their images, and then determine the circle or line through those points.

Let&#x27;s apply this method to the imaginary axis.

Take three points on the imaginary axis:

1. z = 0: f(0) = 2/i = -2i.

2. z = i: f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

3. z = ∞: The transformation as z approaches ∞ along the imaginary axis: f(z) = (i*z + 2)/(4*z + i) ≈ (i*z)/(4*z) = i/4.

So the three image points are -2i, -i/5, and i/4.

These three points are on the imaginary axis. To determine if they lie on a circle, note that three colinear points (on the same line) lie on an infinite number of circles, but in the standard plane, the only circle that includes them is the line itself, considered as a circle with infinite radius. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line, which is a &quot;circle&quot; with infinite radius. But the problem asks for the radius of the circle, which is finite. Therefore, this suggests that only the real axis is mapped to a circle with finite radius, and the answer should be 9/8.

However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the circle, which contradicts our findings. Therefore, perhaps there&#x27;s an error in the problem or in my solution.

Wait, let&#x27;s cross-verify the image of the real axis. We found that it&#x27;s a circle with center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. Let me check if the images of the real axis include points from the imaginary axis&#x27;s image. For example, take z =0 (on both axes), maps to -2i, which is on the circle (distance from center (0, -7/8) to -2i (0, -2) is | -2 - (-7/8)| = |-16/8 +7/8| = |-9/8| = 9/8, which is the radius. So yes, -2i is on the circle. The point at infinity maps to i/4, which is also on the circle: center (0, -7/8), distance to i/4 (0, 1/4) is |1/4 - (-7/8)| = |1/4 +7/8| = |9/8| =9/8, which is the radius. The images of the real axis include points like i/4 and -2i, which are also images of points on the imaginary axis. Wait, hold on. The image of the real axis includes the point -2i (image of z=0) and i/4 (image of z=∞), which are also images of points on the imaginary axis (z=0 and z=∞). Similarly, images of the imaginary axis include -2i, which is also on the real axis&#x27;s image. Wait, but the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, but the circle we found for the real axis&#x27;s image includes some points on the imaginary axis. Specifically, the circle intersects the imaginary axis at -2i and i/4. But the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, which includes these two points. Therefore, perhaps the problem is referring to the circle that is the image of the real axis, and the image of the imaginary axis is the line that coincides with the imaginary axis, intersecting the circle at -2i and i/4. However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the same circle. Since the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line intersecting that circle at two points, but not the entire circle. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my previous reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary line. Let me check with another point.

Take z = 2i (s=2). Then f(2i) = (i*2i +2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 +2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) =0, which is on the real axis&#x27;s image circle? Let&#x27;s check. The circle has center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. The point 0 is at (0,0). The distance from (0,0) to (0, -7/8) is 7/8, which is less than 9/8, so 0 is inside the circle. Wait, but 0 is the image of z=2i, which is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, 0 is inside the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis includes points inside the circle. But the image of the real axis is the circle itself. So the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary axis, which intersects the circle at -2i and i/4, and passes through 0 inside the circle. Therefore, the two images are different: one is a circle, the other is a line intersecting the circle. So the problem statement must be incorrect, or I have a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem is to find the radius of the circle that both axes are mapped to, implying that both images coincide. In that case, my previous calculation must be wrong.

Wait, let&#x27;s see. The transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let me check if it&#x27;s an involution or has some symmetry. Let me compute f(f(z)):

Compute f(f(z)):

First, f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let&#x27;s substitute w = f(z):

f(w) = (i w +2 )/(4 w +i )

Substitute w = (i z +2)/(4 z +i ):

= [ i*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +2 ] / [4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ]

Simplify numerator:

[ (i^2 z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2 ] = [ (-z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2*(4 z +i )/(4 z +i ) ]

= [ (-z + 2i +8 z +2i )/(4 z +i ) ] = [7 z +4i )/(4 z +i )

Denominator:

[4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ] = [4i z +8 +i*(4 z +i ) ]/(4 z +i )

= [4i z +8 +4i z +i^2 ]/(4 z +i )

= [8i z +8 -1 ]/(4 z +i )

= (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i )

Therefore, f(f(z)) = [ (7 z +4i )/(4 z +i ) ] / [ (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i ) ] = (7 z +4i )/(8i z +7 )

This is not equal to z, so f is not an involution. Therefore, there&#x27;s no immediate symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation maps both axes to the same circle due to some symmetry. But my previous computations do not support this. The real axis maps to a circle, and the imaginary axis maps to a line. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in my solution.

Alternatively, maybe the question is to find the radius for each axis separately. For the real axis, we have radius 9/8. For the imaginary axis, since it&#x27;s mapped to a line, which can be thought of as a circle with infinite radius, but the problem asks for a finite radius. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 9/8.

Given the problem&#x27;s wording, and since the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line (infinite radius), but the problem mentions &quot;the circle&quot;, likely referring to the real axis&#x27;s image, which is a finite circle, the answer should be 9/8.

But to confirm, let&#x27;s see if any other references or methods can show that both images are the same circle.

Alternatively, suppose we consider the transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i )

Let me check if it maps the real axis to a circle and the imaginary axis to the same circle.

From previous calculations, the real axis maps to a circle with center (0, -7/8 ) and radius 9/8. The imaginary axis maps to the imaginary line, which intersects this circle at -2i and i/4. The points -2i and i/4 are both on the circle, as:

Distance from -2i (0, -2) to center (0, -7/8 ) is | -2 - (-7/8 ) | = |-9/8 | =9/8.

Distance from i/4 (0, 1/4 ) to center (0, -7/8 ) is |1/4 - (-7/8 ) | = |9/8 | =9/8.

But the rest of the imaginary axis is not on the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis is the line passing through -2i and i/4 and extending to infinity, which is the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is not the same as the image of the real axis, unless we consider the extended line as a circle, which has infinite radius.

Given that the problem asks for the radius of the circle, expecting a finite number, and given that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, I think the answer is 9/8.

Therefore, the radius is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the circle is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes, we analyze the images of these axes under the transformation.

### Image of the Real Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \) where \( t \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = t \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i}
   \]
3. **Separating Real and Imaginary Parts**:
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
   This gives the parametric equations:
   \[
   u(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1}, \quad v(t) = \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
4. **Finding the Circle**:
   - By eliminating the parameter \( t \), we find that the image lies on a circle.
   - The circle&#x27;s center is found to be \( (0, -\frac{7}{8}) \) and the radius is calculated as \( \frac{9}{8} \).

### Image of the Imaginary Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = is \) where \( s \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = is \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(is) = \frac{-s + 2}{i(4s + 1)}
   \]
3. **Simplifying**:
   - This results in purely imaginary numbers, indicating the image is a line (the imaginary axis in the complex plane).

### Conclusion
The real axis is mapped to a circle with radius \( \frac{9}{8} \). The imaginary axis is mapped to a line, which in the extended complex plane can be considered a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem specifies a finite radius, so we conclude the radius of the circle onto which the real axis is mapped is the answer.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of the circle that the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes onto. Hmm, bilinear transformations, also known as Möbius transformations, right? They have some properties like mapping circles and lines to circles or lines. Since both the real and imaginary axes are lines in the complex plane, their images under this transformation should be either circles or lines. The problem says &quot;onto the circle,&quot; so I guess both axes are mapped to the same circle? Or maybe each axis is mapped to a circle, and we need to find their radii? Wait, the question says &quot;the circle,&quot; so maybe both are mapped to the same circle? Let me check the wording again: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So, both axes are mapped to the same circle, and we need to find its radius. Alright, that makes sense.

First, let me recall that a bilinear transformation is determined by its action on three points. Also, since it&#x27;s a transformation from the extended complex plane to itself, it can map lines to circles and vice versa. The real and imaginary axes are both lines through the origin, but perpendicular to each other. The transformation \( f(z) \) is given, so maybe I can find images of points on the real axis and the imaginary axis and see what circle they lie on.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the real axis and the imaginary axis, plug them into the transformation, and then find the equation of the image curve, which should be a circle, and then find its radius.

Let me try this approach.

First, let&#x27;s handle the real axis. The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \), where \( t \) is a real number. Then, substitute \( z = t \) into the transformation:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \).

Similarly, the imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = i s \), where \( s \) is a real number. Substituting \( z = i s \):

\( f(i s) = \frac{i (i s) + 2}{4 (i s) + i} = \frac{-s + 2}{4 i s + i} = \frac{(-s + 2)}{i (4 s + 1)} \).

Let me compute both images and see if they lie on the same circle.

Starting with the real axis:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \). Let me write this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let me denote \( f(t) = u + iv \).

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize:

Denominator: \( 4 t + i \), conjugate is \( 4 t - i \).

So,

\( f(t) = \frac{(i t + 2)(4 t - i)}{(4 t + i)(4 t - i)} \).

Compute the denominator first:

\( (4 t)^2 - (i)^2 = 16 t^2 - (-1) = 16 t^2 + 1 \).

Numerator:

Expand \( (i t + 2)(4 t - i) \):

First term: \( i t \cdot 4 t = 4 i t^2 \)

Second term: \( i t \cdot (-i) = -i^2 t = -(-1) t = t \)

Third term: \( 2 \cdot 4 t = 8 t \)

Fourth term: \( 2 \cdot (-i) = -2 i \)

So combining all terms:

\( 4 i t^2 + t + 8 t - 2 i = 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \).

Therefore, the numerator is \( 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \), and the denominator is \( 16 t^2 + 1 \).

So, separating into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( 9 t / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Imaginary part: \( (4 t^2 - 2) / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Therefore, \( f(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \).

So, parametrizing the image of the real axis as \( (u(t), v(t)) \), where:

\( u(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

\( v(t) = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

Now, to find the equation of the circle that these points lie on, I can try to eliminate the parameter \( t \) from the equations for \( u \) and \( v \).

Let me set:

\( u = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (1)

\( v = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (2)

Let me solve equation (1) for \( t \):

From (1):

\( u (16 t^2 + 1) = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 + u = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 - 9 t + u = 0 \)

This is a quadratic equation in \( t \), but maybe it&#x27;s messy to solve for \( t \). Alternatively, let me express \( t \) from equation (1) in terms of \( u \), but it&#x27;s a quadratic, so maybe another approach.

Alternatively, notice that from equation (2), we can express \( 16 t^2 + 1 \) as denominator, so let me denote \( D = 16 t^2 + 1 \). Then:

\( u = 9 t / D \)

\( v = (4 t^2 - 2)/D \)

Then, let&#x27;s compute \( u^2 + v^2 \):

\( u^2 + v^2 = (81 t^2 + (4 t^2 - 2)^2) / D^2 \)

Compute numerator:

\( 81 t^2 + (16 t^4 - 16 t^2 + 4) = 16 t^4 + (81 t^2 - 16 t^2) + 4 = 16 t^4 + 65 t^2 + 4 \)

But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, express \( t \) in terms of \( u \) and substitute into \( v \).

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider that the image lies on a circle, so its equation can be written as \( (u - a)^2 + (v - b)^2 = r^2 \). We need to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( r \).

But since both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to the same circle, we might need to consider points from both images to determine the circle. Alternatively, maybe each axis maps to a circle, and both circles have the same radius? Wait, the problem states &quot;the circle&quot;, so perhaps both axes are mapped to the same circle. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the image of each axis is a circle, and we have to find the radius of each? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes,&quot; which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle, so their images coincide as a circle. Let me check with specific points.

First, check some points on the real axis and see where they are mapped.

Take z = 0 (on real axis): f(0) = (i*0 + 2)/(4*0 + i) = 2 / i = -2i.

Take z = ∞ (on extended real axis): The limit as t approaches ∞ of f(t) = (i t + 2)/(4 t + i) ≈ (i t)/(4 t) = i/4. So f(∞) = i/4.

Take z = 1: f(1) = (i + 2)/(4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 - i):

Numerator: (i + 2)(4 - i) = 4i - i^2 + 8 - 2i = (4i - 2i) + ( -i^2 +8 ) = 2i + 1 +8 = 2i +9

Denominator: (4 + i)(4 - i) = 16 - i^2 = 17

Thus, f(1) = (9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (9/17, 2/17)

Similarly, take z = -1: f(-1) = (-i + 2)/(-4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (-4 - i):

Numerator: (-i + 2)(-4 - i) = (-i)(-4) + (-i)(-i) + 2*(-4) + 2*(-i) = 4i + i^2 -8 -2i = (4i - 2i) + (-1 -8) = 2i -9

Denominator: (-4 + i)(-4 -i) = 16 - (i)^2 = 17

Thus, f(-1) = (-9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (-9/17, 2/17)

So these points are on the image of the real axis. Similarly, the points when z approaches 0 and ∞ are -2i and i/4. So plotting these points: -2i, i/4, (9/17, 2/17), (-9/17, 2/17). Hmm, these points seem to lie on a circle. Let&#x27;s check if they lie on the same circle.

First, let&#x27;s check if points -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17) lie on a circle.

A circle in the complex plane can be represented as |w - c| = r, where c is the center and r is the radius.

Let me consider three points: -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17).

First, represent these points in coordinates:

-2i is (0, -2)

i/4 is (0, 1/4)

(9/17, 2/17) is (9/17, 2/17)

So, three points: (0, -2), (0, 1/4), (9/17, 2/17)

We need to find the circle passing through these three points.

Let me denote the circle equation as \( (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Plugging in the three points:

1. For (0, -2):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (-2 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

2. For (0, 1/4):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (1/4 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

3. For (9/17, 2/17):

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

\( [a^2 + (b + 2)^2] - [a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( (b + 2)^2 - (b - 1/4)^2 = 0 \)

Expand both squares:

\( [b^2 +4b +4] - [b^2 - (1/2)b + 1/16] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( b^2 +4b +4 -b^2 + (1/2)b -1/16 = 0 \)

Combine like terms:

\( (4b + (1/2)b) + (4 - 1/16) = 0 \)

\( (9/2)b + (63/16) = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:

\( 72b + 63 = 0 \)

=&gt; 72b = -63 =&gt; b = -63/72 = -7/8

So, the y-coordinate of the center is -7/8.

Now, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 1:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 + 2 = -7/8 + 16/8 = 9/8

So,

\( a^2 + (9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Similarly, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 2:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 - 2/8 = -9/8

Thus,

\( a^2 + (-9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; same as above, so no new information.

Now, use equation 3 with b = -7/8:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - (-7/8))^2 = r^2 \)

First, compute 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16/136 + 119/136) = 135/136

So,

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = r^2 \)

We also have from equation 1: \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Set them equal:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Expand the left side:

\( (81/289 - (18/17)a + a^2) + (18225/18496) = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Simplify:

\( a^2 - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Cancel \( a^2 \):

\( - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = 81/64 \)

Multiply all terms by 18496 (which is 17^2 * 16^2) to eliminate denominators:

Let&#x27;s compute each term:

- (18/17)a * 18496 = -18 * 18496 /17 * a = -18*1088*a = -19584 a

81/289 *18496 = 81 * (18496 /289) = 81 * 64 = 5184

18225/18496 *18496 = 18225

81/64 *18496 = 81 * 18496 /64 = 81 * 289 = 23409

So the equation becomes:

-19584a + 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Compute 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Thus:

-19584a + 23409 = 23409

Subtract 23409:

-19584a = 0 =&gt; a = 0

Therefore, the center is at (0, -7/8) and radius squared is \( a^2 + 81/64 = 81/64 \), so radius is 9/8.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Wait, but let&#x27;s check if the point (9/17, 2/17) lies on this circle.

Center is (0, -7/8), radius 9/8.

Compute distance from (9/17, 2/17) to (0, -7/8):

Difference in x: 9/17 - 0 = 9/17

Difference in y: 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16 + 119)/136 = 135/136

Compute the distance squared:

(9/17)^2 + (135/136)^2

= 81/289 + 18225/18496

Convert to common denominator:

81/289 = (81 * 64)/ (289 * 64) = 5184/18496

18225/18496

Sum: 5184 + 18225 = 23409 /18496 = (153)^2 / (136)^2 = (153/136)^2

But 153 = 9*17, 136 = 8*17, so 153/136 = 9/8. Hence, distance squared is (9/8)^2, so distance is 9/8, which matches the radius. So, yes, the point is on the circle.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Now, let&#x27;s check the image of the imaginary axis. Earlier, we parametrized z = i s, so:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } \)

Let me simplify this expression.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s + 1)(-i) } \)

Wait, denominator: i*(4s +1)*(-i) = -i^2*(4s +1) = (1)*(4s +1) = 4s +1.

Numerator: (-s + 2)(-i) = (s - 2)i

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \)

So, written as \( u + iv \), this is:

\( u = 0 \), \( v = \frac{ s - 2 }{ 4s +1 } \)

Wait, hold on: Wait, if \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then the real part is 0 and the imaginary part is \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), right? Because multiplying by i gives a purely imaginary number.

Wait, but no: Let me check again. If we have \( \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then that&#x27;s equal to \( i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is a purely imaginary number. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points \( 0 + i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is the imaginary axis in the complex plane? But parametrized by s. Wait, but s is real, except when 4s +1 =0, i.e., s = -1/4, which would be a point at infinity.

But hold on, the image is a subset of the imaginary axis? But that can&#x27;t be, since the problem states that the transformation maps the axes to a circle. But according to this, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let&#x27;s recast the computation of f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis.

Given \( z = i s \), then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i} = \frac{ -s + 2 }{4i s + i } \)

Factor out i from the denominator:

\( \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } = \frac{ (-s + 2) }{i (4 s + 1)} \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1) } \)

Because denominator: \( i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1 \), so denominator becomes \( (4 s +1) \)

So, numerator is \( (s - 2)i \), so \( f(z) = \frac{(s - 2)i}{4 s +1 } \)

Therefore, this is a purely imaginary number scaled by \( \frac{(s - 2)}{4 s +1 } \). So the image is the imaginary axis? But parametrized with a real parameter s. Wait, but except when 4 s +1 =0, which would be s = -1/4, but as s approaches -1/4, the image goes to infinity.

But the imaginary axis is a line, not a circle. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. But since bilinear transformations map circles and lines to circles or lines, the image of the imaginary axis under this transformation is either a line or a circle. But according to this computation, it&#x27;s the imaginary axis, which is a line. But the problem states that it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So if the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line, then they can&#x27;t both be mapped to the same circle. But according to the problem statement, it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle onto which both axes are mapped. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my computation.

Wait, let&#x27;s re-examine the transformation. The transformation is \( f(z) = \frac{ i z + 2 }{4 z + i } \). Let me check if it&#x27;s invertible. The determinant of the coefficients matrix is (i)(i) - (2)(4) = (-1) - 8 = -9 ≠ 0, so it&#x27;s invertible.

Wait, when I computed the image of the imaginary axis, I substituted z = i s and found that f(z) is purely imaginary. But that would imply the image is the imaginary axis, but that contradicts the problem&#x27;s statement. Hmm. So perhaps my error is in the calculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s recompute the image of z = i s:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i } \)

Compute numerator: \( i^2 s + 2 = -s + 2 \)

Denominator: \( 4i s + i = i(4 s +1 ) \)

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i(4 s + 1) } \)

To express this in terms of real and imaginary parts, we can multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i(4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1 ) } \)

Since the denominator was multiplied by -i, which is the conjugate of i, to make it real.

Thus, the result is \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s +1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). So, as s varies over real numbers (excluding s = -1/4), the image is all purely imaginary numbers except when s approaches -1/4, which would approach infinity.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under f(z) is the imaginary axis in the w-plane, plus the point at infinity. But in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem states that both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to a circle. But according to the computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8 and center at (0, -7/8), while the imaginary axis is mapped to the imaginary line (which is a circle through infinity). Therefore, there must be an error here.

But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;. Maybe the problem is that in the finite plane, the image of the imaginary axis is a line, but perhaps when considering the extended complex plane, the line together with the point at infinity forms a circle. However, in that case, the radius would be infinite, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I have a miscalculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s check with specific points on the imaginary axis.

Take z = 0 (on imaginary axis? Wait, z=0 is on both axes, but in the parametrization z = i s, when s = 0, we get z=0. Then f(0) = 2/i = -2i, which is the same as before.

Take z = i (s=1): f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

Take z = 2i (s=2): f(2i) = (i*2i + 2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 + 2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) = 0.

Take z = i/2 (s=1/2): f(i/2) = (i*(i/2) +2)/(4*(i/2) +i) = (-1/2 + 2)/(2i +i) = (3/2)/(3i) = (3/2)/(3i) = 1/(2i) = -i/2.

Take z approaching infinity along the imaginary axis: s approaches infinity, so f(z) = ( -s + 2 ) / (4i s +i ) ≈ -s / 4i s = -1/(4i) = i/4.

So the images are: -2i, -i/5, 0, -i/2, and i/4. These points are all on the imaginary axis. So when s approaches infinity, f(z) approaches i/4, which is a finite point. When s approaches -1/4, the denominator 4s +1 approaches zero, so f(z) approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which in the extended complex plane is a circle. But in the standard complex plane, it&#x27;s a line. However, since Möbius transformations map lines to circles or lines, depending on whether they pass through the pole of the transformation.

But in our case, the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is not on the imaginary axis (since the imaginary axis is z = iy, and -i/4 is on the imaginary axis). Wait, z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis. Wait, the denominator 4z +i =0 when z = -i/4. Therefore, the point z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, and thus the transformation has a pole there. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation should be a circle, because the pole is on the original axis, so the image is a circle.

But according to the previous computation, the image seems to be the entire imaginary axis. But that contradicts. Wait, perhaps there&#x27;s a mistake here.

Wait, if the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is on the imaginary axis, then the image of the imaginary axis should be a circle in the extended complex plane. However, when we parameterized it, we obtained the entire imaginary axis except for the point at s = -1/4, which maps to infinity. Therefore, in the extended complex plane, the image is the imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which is a &quot;circle&quot; passing through infinity, i.e., a line. But according to Möbius transformation properties, if the original line passes through the pole, then the image is a line; otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle. Wait, maybe that&#x27;s the key.

Wait, the general property is that Möbius transformations map circles and lines to circles and lines. A line can be considered a circle passing through infinity. If the original line passes through the pole of the transformation (the point where the denominator is zero), then the image will pass through infinity, hence it&#x27;s a line. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle.

In our case, the real axis does not pass through the pole z = -i/4, since the pole is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle. The imaginary axis does pass through the pole z = -i/4, so its image is a line (the extended line, i.e., a circle passing through infinity).

But the problem states that the transformation maps both the real and imaginary axes onto the same circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Therefore, either the problem is ill-posed, or my computations are wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the image of each axis separately, and both images are circles, but with the same radius? Let me check again.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute the image of the imaginary axis again more carefully.

Parametrizing z = i s, then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (2 - s) }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(z) = \frac{ (2 - s)(-i) }{ (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ 4 s + 1 } \)

Thus, this is equal to \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s + 1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). Therefore, as s varies over ℝ \ { -1/4 }, the image is all imaginary numbers. However, when s approaches -1/4, the denominator approaches zero, so the image approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the extended imaginary axis (including infinity), which is a line in the extended complex plane. But the problem says it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle, which suggests a finite circle.

But according to my previous calculation, the image of the real axis is a circle with radius 9/8. However, the problem mentions &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle. But according to my computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misstated, or I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check another point on the imaginary axis. Take z = -i/4, which is the pole. But z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so it&#x27;s mapped to infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line plus infinity, which is a line in the extended plane. So that can&#x27;t be a circle. However, the problem says &quot;onto the circle&quot;, so maybe the question is actually only referring to the real axis? Or maybe the problem is in error.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation when considering the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s consider another approach. Let&#x27;s suppose that both images are circles. Wait, but we saw that the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line. However, maybe in the extended plane, the line is considered a circle, but the problem is asking for the radius in the standard plane, so only the real axis&#x27;s image is a circle with finite radius, and the imaginary axis&#x27;s image is a line, which has infinite radius. But the problem says &quot;the circle&quot;, so maybe the answer is 9/8, the radius from the real axis image.

But the problem states: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; If both axes are mapped to the same circle, but our calculation shows that the real axis is mapped to a circle and the imaginary axis to a line, there&#x27;s a problem. Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s try parametrizing the image of the imaginary axis again. Suppose I write w = f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis, so z = iy, y ∈ ℝ.

Then, w = (i*(iy) + 2)/(4*(iy) + i) = (-y + 2)/(4iy + i) = (2 - y)/(i(4y +1)).

Let me write w = u + iv.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

w = (2 - y)(-i)/(i(4y +1)(-i)) = (-i(2 - y))/( (4y +1) )

The denominator simplifies to (4y +1) because i*(-i) = 1.

Therefore, w = -i(2 - y)/(4y +1 ) = [ (y - 2)/(4y +1) ] i.

So, w is purely imaginary, with v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ), and u = 0.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ) for real y ≠ -1/4.

To see if this is a circle, we can parametrize v in terms of y:

Let me set t = y, then v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

This is a hyperbola or a straight line?

Wait, solving for t:

v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

Multiply both sides by (4t +1):

v(4t +1 ) = t -2

4v t + v = t -2

4v t - t = -2 - v

t(4v -1 ) = - (2 + v )

Therefore,

t = - (2 + v ) / (4v -1 )

This shows that for each v ≠ 1/4, there&#x27;s a corresponding t. But this parametrization covers all real numbers except v = 1/4, which would require the denominator 4v -1 =0, i.e., v=1/4. When v approaches 1/4, t approaches infinity.

But the image is the set of all points (0, v) where v can be any real number except v=1/4. Wait, but in reality, when t approaches infinity, v = (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t/(4t ) = 1/4. So, as t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4 from below. Similarly, when t approaches -1/4 from the right, denominator approaches zero, and v approaches ± infinity depending on the direction.

Wait, let&#x27;s analyze the function v(t) = (t -2)/(4t +1 )

Find the range of v(t):

As t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4.

As t approaches -1/4 from above, denominator approaches 0+, numerator approaches (-1/4 - 2 )= -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0+ = -infty.

As t approaches -1/4 from below, denominator approaches 0-, numerator approaches -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0- = +infty.

At t = 2, v=0.

Therefore, the function v(t) maps:

t ∈ (-∞, -1/4 ) to v ∈ (1/4, +infty ) (wait, hold on):

Wait, let&#x27;s check:

For t &lt; -1/4:

Denominator 4t +1 &lt; 0.

Numerator t -2: If t approaches -infty, t -2 approaches -infty.

So for t &lt; -1/4:

v = (negative)/(negative) = positive.

As t approaches -infty, v ≈ t /4t = 1/4. So from above.

Wait, as t approaches -infty, (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t /4t = 1/4, approaching 1/4 from above? Wait:

Let me compute the limit as t approaches -infty:

(t -2)/(4t +1 ) = [ t (1 - 2/t ) ] / [ t (4 + 1/t ) ] = (1 - 0)/(4 +0 ) = 1/4. So as t approaches -infty, v approaches 1/4 from above (since numerator is negative and denominator is negative, making positive, and when t approaches -infty, the difference from 1/4 is positive). Wait, not sure. Let me plug in t = -N where N is a large positive number:

v = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (N +2)/(4N -1 ) ≈ N /4N = 1/4. So approaching 1/4 from above? Let&#x27;s compute for large N:

(N +2)/(4N -1 ) = [N(1 + 2/N )]/[N(4 -1/N ) ] = (1 + 2/N )/(4 -1/N ) ≈ (1 +0 )/(4 -0 ) = 1/4. So as N increases, the value approaches 1/4 from slightly above? Let&#x27;s take N=1000:

(1000 +2 )/(4000 -1 ) = 1002/3999 ≈ 0.2506, which is slightly more than 1/4. So yes, approaches 1/4 from above.

Similarly, for t approaching -1/4 from the left (t approaching -1/4- ):

t approaching -1/4 from below (t = -1/4 - ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 - ε -2 ) = -9/4 - ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 - ε ) +1 = -1 -4ε +1 = -4ε

So v = (-9/4 - ε )/(-4ε ) = (9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (9/4)/4ε = 9/(16ε ), which approaches +infty as ε→0+.

For t approaching -1/4 from the right (t = -1/4 + ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 + ε -2 ) = -9/4 + ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 + ε ) +1 = -1 +4ε +1 = 4ε

v = (-9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (-9/4)/4ε = -9/(16ε ), which approaches -infty as ε→0+.

At t = 2: v=0.

Therefore, the range of v(t) is:

- When t ∈ (-infty, -1/4 ), v ∈ (1/4, +infty )

- When t ∈ (-1/4, ∞ ), v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 )

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 ) ∪ (1/4, +infty ), i.e., the entire imaginary axis except the point v=1/4. But in the extended complex plane, we include infinity, so the image is the entire imaginary axis (as a line), which makes sense because the pole at z=-i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so the image is a line.

But according to the problem statement, we should map both axes to a circle. This suggests a discrepancy. However, earlier computation showed that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I misinterpreted it. Maybe it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle that the real axis is mapped to, and separately the radius for the imaginary axis? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which seems to imply a single circle. But according to my calculations, they are mapped to different circles (one a finite circle, one a line). This is confusing.

Wait, maybe there&#x27;s a mistake in the computation for the image of the imaginary axis. Let me try a different approach. Instead of parametrizing z = i s, perhaps I should consider the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation f(z) and see if it can be represented as a circle.

The general method for finding the image of a line under a Möbius transformation is to take three points on the original line, find their images, and then determine the circle or line through those points.

Let&#x27;s apply this method to the imaginary axis.

Take three points on the imaginary axis:

1. z = 0: f(0) = 2/i = -2i.

2. z = i: f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

3. z = ∞: The transformation as z approaches ∞ along the imaginary axis: f(z) = (i*z + 2)/(4*z + i) ≈ (i*z)/(4*z) = i/4.

So the three image points are -2i, -i/5, and i/4.

These three points are on the imaginary axis. To determine if they lie on a circle, note that three colinear points (on the same line) lie on an infinite number of circles, but in the standard plane, the only circle that includes them is the line itself, considered as a circle with infinite radius. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line, which is a &quot;circle&quot; with infinite radius. But the problem asks for the radius of the circle, which is finite. Therefore, this suggests that only the real axis is mapped to a circle with finite radius, and the answer should be 9/8.

However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the circle, which contradicts our findings. Therefore, perhaps there&#x27;s an error in the problem or in my solution.

Wait, let&#x27;s cross-verify the image of the real axis. We found that it&#x27;s a circle with center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. Let me check if the images of the real axis include points from the imaginary axis&#x27;s image. For example, take z =0 (on both axes), maps to -2i, which is on the circle (distance from center (0, -7/8) to -2i (0, -2) is | -2 - (-7/8)| = |-16/8 +7/8| = |-9/8| = 9/8, which is the radius. So yes, -2i is on the circle. The point at infinity maps to i/4, which is also on the circle: center (0, -7/8), distance to i/4 (0, 1/4) is |1/4 - (-7/8)| = |1/4 +7/8| = |9/8| =9/8, which is the radius. The images of the real axis include points like i/4 and -2i, which are also images of points on the imaginary axis. Wait, hold on. The image of the real axis includes the point -2i (image of z=0) and i/4 (image of z=∞), which are also images of points on the imaginary axis (z=0 and z=∞). Similarly, images of the imaginary axis include -2i, which is also on the real axis&#x27;s image. Wait, but the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, but the circle we found for the real axis&#x27;s image includes some points on the imaginary axis. Specifically, the circle intersects the imaginary axis at -2i and i/4. But the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, which includes these two points. Therefore, perhaps the problem is referring to the circle that is the image of the real axis, and the image of the imaginary axis is the line that coincides with the imaginary axis, intersecting the circle at -2i and i/4. However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the same circle. Since the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line intersecting that circle at two points, but not the entire circle. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my previous reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary line. Let me check with another point.

Take z = 2i (s=2). Then f(2i) = (i*2i +2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 +2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) =0, which is on the real axis&#x27;s image circle? Let&#x27;s check. The circle has center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. The point 0 is at (0,0). The distance from (0,0) to (0, -7/8) is 7/8, which is less than 9/8, so 0 is inside the circle. Wait, but 0 is the image of z=2i, which is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, 0 is inside the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis includes points inside the circle. But the image of the real axis is the circle itself. So the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary axis, which intersects the circle at -2i and i/4, and passes through 0 inside the circle. Therefore, the two images are different: one is a circle, the other is a line intersecting the circle. So the problem statement must be incorrect, or I have a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem is to find the radius of the circle that both axes are mapped to, implying that both images coincide. In that case, my previous calculation must be wrong.

Wait, let&#x27;s see. The transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let me check if it&#x27;s an involution or has some symmetry. Let me compute f(f(z)):

Compute f(f(z)):

First, f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let&#x27;s substitute w = f(z):

f(w) = (i w +2 )/(4 w +i )

Substitute w = (i z +2)/(4 z +i ):

= [ i*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +2 ] / [4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ]

Simplify numerator:

[ (i^2 z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2 ] = [ (-z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2*(4 z +i )/(4 z +i ) ]

= [ (-z + 2i +8 z +2i )/(4 z +i ) ] = [7 z +4i )/(4 z +i )

Denominator:

[4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ] = [4i z +8 +i*(4 z +i ) ]/(4 z +i )

= [4i z +8 +4i z +i^2 ]/(4 z +i )

= [8i z +8 -1 ]/(4 z +i )

= (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i )

Therefore, f(f(z)) = [ (7 z +4i )/(4 z +i ) ] / [ (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i ) ] = (7 z +4i )/(8i z +7 )

This is not equal to z, so f is not an involution. Therefore, there&#x27;s no immediate symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation maps both axes to the same circle due to some symmetry. But my previous computations do not support this. The real axis maps to a circle, and the imaginary axis maps to a line. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in my solution.

Alternatively, maybe the question is to find the radius for each axis separately. For the real axis, we have radius 9/8. For the imaginary axis, since it&#x27;s mapped to a line, which can be thought of as a circle with infinite radius, but the problem asks for a finite radius. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 9/8.

Given the problem&#x27;s wording, and since the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line (infinite radius), but the problem mentions &quot;the circle&quot;, likely referring to the real axis&#x27;s image, which is a finite circle, the answer should be 9/8.

But to confirm, let&#x27;s see if any other references or methods can show that both images are the same circle.

Alternatively, suppose we consider the transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i )

Let me check if it maps the real axis to a circle and the imaginary axis to the same circle.

From previous calculations, the real axis maps to a circle with center (0, -7/8 ) and radius 9/8. The imaginary axis maps to the imaginary line, which intersects this circle at -2i and i/4. The points -2i and i/4 are both on the circle, as:

Distance from -2i (0, -2) to center (0, -7/8 ) is | -2 - (-7/8 ) | = |-9/8 | =9/8.

Distance from i/4 (0, 1/4 ) to center (0, -7/8 ) is |1/4 - (-7/8 ) | = |9/8 | =9/8.

But the rest of the imaginary axis is not on the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis is the line passing through -2i and i/4 and extending to infinity, which is the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is not the same as the image of the real axis, unless we consider the extended line as a circle, which has infinite radius.

Given that the problem asks for the radius of the circle, expecting a finite number, and given that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, I think the answer is 9/8.

Therefore, the radius is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the circle is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes, we analyze the images of these axes under the transformation.

### Image of the Real Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \) where \( t \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = t \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i}
   \]
3. **Separating Real and Imaginary Parts**:
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
   This gives the parametric equations:
   \[
   u(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1}, \quad v(t) = \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
4. **Finding the Circle**:
   - By eliminating the parameter \( t \), we find that the image lies on a circle.
   - The circle&#x27;s center is found to be \( (0, -\frac{7}{8}) \) and the radius is calculated as \( \frac{9}{8} \).

### Image of the Imaginary Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = is \) where \( s \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = is \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(is) = \frac{-s + 2}{i(4s + 1)}
   \]
3. **Simplifying**:
   - This results in purely imaginary numbers, indicating the image is a line (the imaginary axis in the complex plane).

### Conclusion
The real axis is mapped to a circle with radius \( \frac{9}{8} \). The imaginary axis is mapped to a line, which in the extended complex plane can be considered a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem specifies a finite radius, so we conclude the radius of the circle onto which the real axis is mapped is the answer.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of the circle that the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes onto. Hmm, bilinear transformations, also known as Möbius transformations, right? They have some properties like mapping circles and lines to circles or lines. Since both the real and imaginary axes are lines in the complex plane, their images under this transformation should be either circles or lines. The problem says &quot;onto the circle,&quot; so I guess both axes are mapped to the same circle? Or maybe each axis is mapped to a circle, and we need to find their radii? Wait, the question says &quot;the circle,&quot; so maybe both are mapped to the same circle? Let me check the wording again: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So, both axes are mapped to the same circle, and we need to find its radius. Alright, that makes sense.

First, let me recall that a bilinear transformation is determined by its action on three points. Also, since it&#x27;s a transformation from the extended complex plane to itself, it can map lines to circles and vice versa. The real and imaginary axes are both lines through the origin, but perpendicular to each other. The transformation \( f(z) \) is given, so maybe I can find images of points on the real axis and the imaginary axis and see what circle they lie on.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the real axis and the imaginary axis, plug them into the transformation, and then find the equation of the image curve, which should be a circle, and then find its radius.

Let me try this approach.

First, let&#x27;s handle the real axis. The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \), where \( t \) is a real number. Then, substitute \( z = t \) into the transformation:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \).

Similarly, the imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = i s \), where \( s \) is a real number. Substituting \( z = i s \):

\( f(i s) = \frac{i (i s) + 2}{4 (i s) + i} = \frac{-s + 2}{4 i s + i} = \frac{(-s + 2)}{i (4 s + 1)} \).

Let me compute both images and see if they lie on the same circle.

Starting with the real axis:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \). Let me write this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let me denote \( f(t) = u + iv \).

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize:

Denominator: \( 4 t + i \), conjugate is \( 4 t - i \).

So,

\( f(t) = \frac{(i t + 2)(4 t - i)}{(4 t + i)(4 t - i)} \).

Compute the denominator first:

\( (4 t)^2 - (i)^2 = 16 t^2 - (-1) = 16 t^2 + 1 \).

Numerator:

Expand \( (i t + 2)(4 t - i) \):

First term: \( i t \cdot 4 t = 4 i t^2 \)

Second term: \( i t \cdot (-i) = -i^2 t = -(-1) t = t \)

Third term: \( 2 \cdot 4 t = 8 t \)

Fourth term: \( 2 \cdot (-i) = -2 i \)

So combining all terms:

\( 4 i t^2 + t + 8 t - 2 i = 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \).

Therefore, the numerator is \( 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \), and the denominator is \( 16 t^2 + 1 \).

So, separating into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( 9 t / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Imaginary part: \( (4 t^2 - 2) / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Therefore, \( f(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \).

So, parametrizing the image of the real axis as \( (u(t), v(t)) \), where:

\( u(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

\( v(t) = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

Now, to find the equation of the circle that these points lie on, I can try to eliminate the parameter \( t \) from the equations for \( u \) and \( v \).

Let me set:

\( u = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (1)

\( v = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (2)

Let me solve equation (1) for \( t \):

From (1):

\( u (16 t^2 + 1) = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 + u = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 - 9 t + u = 0 \)

This is a quadratic equation in \( t \), but maybe it&#x27;s messy to solve for \( t \). Alternatively, let me express \( t \) from equation (1) in terms of \( u \), but it&#x27;s a quadratic, so maybe another approach.

Alternatively, notice that from equation (2), we can express \( 16 t^2 + 1 \) as denominator, so let me denote \( D = 16 t^2 + 1 \). Then:

\( u = 9 t / D \)

\( v = (4 t^2 - 2)/D \)

Then, let&#x27;s compute \( u^2 + v^2 \):

\( u^2 + v^2 = (81 t^2 + (4 t^2 - 2)^2) / D^2 \)

Compute numerator:

\( 81 t^2 + (16 t^4 - 16 t^2 + 4) = 16 t^4 + (81 t^2 - 16 t^2) + 4 = 16 t^4 + 65 t^2 + 4 \)

But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, express \( t \) in terms of \( u \) and substitute into \( v \).

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider that the image lies on a circle, so its equation can be written as \( (u - a)^2 + (v - b)^2 = r^2 \). We need to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( r \).

But since both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to the same circle, we might need to consider points from both images to determine the circle. Alternatively, maybe each axis maps to a circle, and both circles have the same radius? Wait, the problem states &quot;the circle&quot;, so perhaps both axes are mapped to the same circle. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the image of each axis is a circle, and we have to find the radius of each? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes,&quot; which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle, so their images coincide as a circle. Let me check with specific points.

First, check some points on the real axis and see where they are mapped.

Take z = 0 (on real axis): f(0) = (i*0 + 2)/(4*0 + i) = 2 / i = -2i.

Take z = ∞ (on extended real axis): The limit as t approaches ∞ of f(t) = (i t + 2)/(4 t + i) ≈ (i t)/(4 t) = i/4. So f(∞) = i/4.

Take z = 1: f(1) = (i + 2)/(4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 - i):

Numerator: (i + 2)(4 - i) = 4i - i^2 + 8 - 2i = (4i - 2i) + ( -i^2 +8 ) = 2i + 1 +8 = 2i +9

Denominator: (4 + i)(4 - i) = 16 - i^2 = 17

Thus, f(1) = (9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (9/17, 2/17)

Similarly, take z = -1: f(-1) = (-i + 2)/(-4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (-4 - i):

Numerator: (-i + 2)(-4 - i) = (-i)(-4) + (-i)(-i) + 2*(-4) + 2*(-i) = 4i + i^2 -8 -2i = (4i - 2i) + (-1 -8) = 2i -9

Denominator: (-4 + i)(-4 -i) = 16 - (i)^2 = 17

Thus, f(-1) = (-9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (-9/17, 2/17)

So these points are on the image of the real axis. Similarly, the points when z approaches 0 and ∞ are -2i and i/4. So plotting these points: -2i, i/4, (9/17, 2/17), (-9/17, 2/17). Hmm, these points seem to lie on a circle. Let&#x27;s check if they lie on the same circle.

First, let&#x27;s check if points -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17) lie on a circle.

A circle in the complex plane can be represented as |w - c| = r, where c is the center and r is the radius.

Let me consider three points: -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17).

First, represent these points in coordinates:

-2i is (0, -2)

i/4 is (0, 1/4)

(9/17, 2/17) is (9/17, 2/17)

So, three points: (0, -2), (0, 1/4), (9/17, 2/17)

We need to find the circle passing through these three points.

Let me denote the circle equation as \( (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Plugging in the three points:

1. For (0, -2):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (-2 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

2. For (0, 1/4):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (1/4 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

3. For (9/17, 2/17):

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

\( [a^2 + (b + 2)^2] - [a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( (b + 2)^2 - (b - 1/4)^2 = 0 \)

Expand both squares:

\( [b^2 +4b +4] - [b^2 - (1/2)b + 1/16] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( b^2 +4b +4 -b^2 + (1/2)b -1/16 = 0 \)

Combine like terms:

\( (4b + (1/2)b) + (4 - 1/16) = 0 \)

\( (9/2)b + (63/16) = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:

\( 72b + 63 = 0 \)

=&gt; 72b = -63 =&gt; b = -63/72 = -7/8

So, the y-coordinate of the center is -7/8.

Now, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 1:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 + 2 = -7/8 + 16/8 = 9/8

So,

\( a^2 + (9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Similarly, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 2:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 - 2/8 = -9/8

Thus,

\( a^2 + (-9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; same as above, so no new information.

Now, use equation 3 with b = -7/8:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - (-7/8))^2 = r^2 \)

First, compute 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16/136 + 119/136) = 135/136

So,

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = r^2 \)

We also have from equation 1: \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Set them equal:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Expand the left side:

\( (81/289 - (18/17)a + a^2) + (18225/18496) = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Simplify:

\( a^2 - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Cancel \( a^2 \):

\( - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = 81/64 \)

Multiply all terms by 18496 (which is 17^2 * 16^2) to eliminate denominators:

Let&#x27;s compute each term:

- (18/17)a * 18496 = -18 * 18496 /17 * a = -18*1088*a = -19584 a

81/289 *18496 = 81 * (18496 /289) = 81 * 64 = 5184

18225/18496 *18496 = 18225

81/64 *18496 = 81 * 18496 /64 = 81 * 289 = 23409

So the equation becomes:

-19584a + 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Compute 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Thus:

-19584a + 23409 = 23409

Subtract 23409:

-19584a = 0 =&gt; a = 0

Therefore, the center is at (0, -7/8) and radius squared is \( a^2 + 81/64 = 81/64 \), so radius is 9/8.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Wait, but let&#x27;s check if the point (9/17, 2/17) lies on this circle.

Center is (0, -7/8), radius 9/8.

Compute distance from (9/17, 2/17) to (0, -7/8):

Difference in x: 9/17 - 0 = 9/17

Difference in y: 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16 + 119)/136 = 135/136

Compute the distance squared:

(9/17)^2 + (135/136)^2

= 81/289 + 18225/18496

Convert to common denominator:

81/289 = (81 * 64)/ (289 * 64) = 5184/18496

18225/18496

Sum: 5184 + 18225 = 23409 /18496 = (153)^2 / (136)^2 = (153/136)^2

But 153 = 9*17, 136 = 8*17, so 153/136 = 9/8. Hence, distance squared is (9/8)^2, so distance is 9/8, which matches the radius. So, yes, the point is on the circle.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Now, let&#x27;s check the image of the imaginary axis. Earlier, we parametrized z = i s, so:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } \)

Let me simplify this expression.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s + 1)(-i) } \)

Wait, denominator: i*(4s +1)*(-i) = -i^2*(4s +1) = (1)*(4s +1) = 4s +1.

Numerator: (-s + 2)(-i) = (s - 2)i

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \)

So, written as \( u + iv \), this is:

\( u = 0 \), \( v = \frac{ s - 2 }{ 4s +1 } \)

Wait, hold on: Wait, if \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then the real part is 0 and the imaginary part is \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), right? Because multiplying by i gives a purely imaginary number.

Wait, but no: Let me check again. If we have \( \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then that&#x27;s equal to \( i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is a purely imaginary number. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points \( 0 + i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is the imaginary axis in the complex plane? But parametrized by s. Wait, but s is real, except when 4s +1 =0, i.e., s = -1/4, which would be a point at infinity.

But hold on, the image is a subset of the imaginary axis? But that can&#x27;t be, since the problem states that the transformation maps the axes to a circle. But according to this, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let&#x27;s recast the computation of f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis.

Given \( z = i s \), then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i} = \frac{ -s + 2 }{4i s + i } \)

Factor out i from the denominator:

\( \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } = \frac{ (-s + 2) }{i (4 s + 1)} \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1) } \)

Because denominator: \( i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1 \), so denominator becomes \( (4 s +1) \)

So, numerator is \( (s - 2)i \), so \( f(z) = \frac{(s - 2)i}{4 s +1 } \)

Therefore, this is a purely imaginary number scaled by \( \frac{(s - 2)}{4 s +1 } \). So the image is the imaginary axis? But parametrized with a real parameter s. Wait, but except when 4 s +1 =0, which would be s = -1/4, but as s approaches -1/4, the image goes to infinity.

But the imaginary axis is a line, not a circle. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. But since bilinear transformations map circles and lines to circles or lines, the image of the imaginary axis under this transformation is either a line or a circle. But according to this computation, it&#x27;s the imaginary axis, which is a line. But the problem states that it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So if the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line, then they can&#x27;t both be mapped to the same circle. But according to the problem statement, it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle onto which both axes are mapped. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my computation.

Wait, let&#x27;s re-examine the transformation. The transformation is \( f(z) = \frac{ i z + 2 }{4 z + i } \). Let me check if it&#x27;s invertible. The determinant of the coefficients matrix is (i)(i) - (2)(4) = (-1) - 8 = -9 ≠ 0, so it&#x27;s invertible.

Wait, when I computed the image of the imaginary axis, I substituted z = i s and found that f(z) is purely imaginary. But that would imply the image is the imaginary axis, but that contradicts the problem&#x27;s statement. Hmm. So perhaps my error is in the calculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s recompute the image of z = i s:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i } \)

Compute numerator: \( i^2 s + 2 = -s + 2 \)

Denominator: \( 4i s + i = i(4 s +1 ) \)

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i(4 s + 1) } \)

To express this in terms of real and imaginary parts, we can multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i(4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1 ) } \)

Since the denominator was multiplied by -i, which is the conjugate of i, to make it real.

Thus, the result is \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s +1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). So, as s varies over real numbers (excluding s = -1/4), the image is all purely imaginary numbers except when s approaches -1/4, which would approach infinity.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under f(z) is the imaginary axis in the w-plane, plus the point at infinity. But in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem states that both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to a circle. But according to the computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8 and center at (0, -7/8), while the imaginary axis is mapped to the imaginary line (which is a circle through infinity). Therefore, there must be an error here.

But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;. Maybe the problem is that in the finite plane, the image of the imaginary axis is a line, but perhaps when considering the extended complex plane, the line together with the point at infinity forms a circle. However, in that case, the radius would be infinite, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I have a miscalculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s check with specific points on the imaginary axis.

Take z = 0 (on imaginary axis? Wait, z=0 is on both axes, but in the parametrization z = i s, when s = 0, we get z=0. Then f(0) = 2/i = -2i, which is the same as before.

Take z = i (s=1): f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

Take z = 2i (s=2): f(2i) = (i*2i + 2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 + 2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) = 0.

Take z = i/2 (s=1/2): f(i/2) = (i*(i/2) +2)/(4*(i/2) +i) = (-1/2 + 2)/(2i +i) = (3/2)/(3i) = (3/2)/(3i) = 1/(2i) = -i/2.

Take z approaching infinity along the imaginary axis: s approaches infinity, so f(z) = ( -s + 2 ) / (4i s +i ) ≈ -s / 4i s = -1/(4i) = i/4.

So the images are: -2i, -i/5, 0, -i/2, and i/4. These points are all on the imaginary axis. So when s approaches infinity, f(z) approaches i/4, which is a finite point. When s approaches -1/4, the denominator 4s +1 approaches zero, so f(z) approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which in the extended complex plane is a circle. But in the standard complex plane, it&#x27;s a line. However, since Möbius transformations map lines to circles or lines, depending on whether they pass through the pole of the transformation.

But in our case, the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is not on the imaginary axis (since the imaginary axis is z = iy, and -i/4 is on the imaginary axis). Wait, z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis. Wait, the denominator 4z +i =0 when z = -i/4. Therefore, the point z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, and thus the transformation has a pole there. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation should be a circle, because the pole is on the original axis, so the image is a circle.

But according to the previous computation, the image seems to be the entire imaginary axis. But that contradicts. Wait, perhaps there&#x27;s a mistake here.

Wait, if the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is on the imaginary axis, then the image of the imaginary axis should be a circle in the extended complex plane. However, when we parameterized it, we obtained the entire imaginary axis except for the point at s = -1/4, which maps to infinity. Therefore, in the extended complex plane, the image is the imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which is a &quot;circle&quot; passing through infinity, i.e., a line. But according to Möbius transformation properties, if the original line passes through the pole, then the image is a line; otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle. Wait, maybe that&#x27;s the key.

Wait, the general property is that Möbius transformations map circles and lines to circles and lines. A line can be considered a circle passing through infinity. If the original line passes through the pole of the transformation (the point where the denominator is zero), then the image will pass through infinity, hence it&#x27;s a line. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle.

In our case, the real axis does not pass through the pole z = -i/4, since the pole is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle. The imaginary axis does pass through the pole z = -i/4, so its image is a line (the extended line, i.e., a circle passing through infinity).

But the problem states that the transformation maps both the real and imaginary axes onto the same circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Therefore, either the problem is ill-posed, or my computations are wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the image of each axis separately, and both images are circles, but with the same radius? Let me check again.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute the image of the imaginary axis again more carefully.

Parametrizing z = i s, then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (2 - s) }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(z) = \frac{ (2 - s)(-i) }{ (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ 4 s + 1 } \)

Thus, this is equal to \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s + 1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). Therefore, as s varies over ℝ \ { -1/4 }, the image is all imaginary numbers. However, when s approaches -1/4, the denominator approaches zero, so the image approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the extended imaginary axis (including infinity), which is a line in the extended complex plane. But the problem says it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle, which suggests a finite circle.

But according to my previous calculation, the image of the real axis is a circle with radius 9/8. However, the problem mentions &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle. But according to my computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misstated, or I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check another point on the imaginary axis. Take z = -i/4, which is the pole. But z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so it&#x27;s mapped to infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line plus infinity, which is a line in the extended plane. So that can&#x27;t be a circle. However, the problem says &quot;onto the circle&quot;, so maybe the question is actually only referring to the real axis? Or maybe the problem is in error.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation when considering the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s consider another approach. Let&#x27;s suppose that both images are circles. Wait, but we saw that the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line. However, maybe in the extended plane, the line is considered a circle, but the problem is asking for the radius in the standard plane, so only the real axis&#x27;s image is a circle with finite radius, and the imaginary axis&#x27;s image is a line, which has infinite radius. But the problem says &quot;the circle&quot;, so maybe the answer is 9/8, the radius from the real axis image.

But the problem states: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; If both axes are mapped to the same circle, but our calculation shows that the real axis is mapped to a circle and the imaginary axis to a line, there&#x27;s a problem. Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s try parametrizing the image of the imaginary axis again. Suppose I write w = f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis, so z = iy, y ∈ ℝ.

Then, w = (i*(iy) + 2)/(4*(iy) + i) = (-y + 2)/(4iy + i) = (2 - y)/(i(4y +1)).

Let me write w = u + iv.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

w = (2 - y)(-i)/(i(4y +1)(-i)) = (-i(2 - y))/( (4y +1) )

The denominator simplifies to (4y +1) because i*(-i) = 1.

Therefore, w = -i(2 - y)/(4y +1 ) = [ (y - 2)/(4y +1) ] i.

So, w is purely imaginary, with v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ), and u = 0.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ) for real y ≠ -1/4.

To see if this is a circle, we can parametrize v in terms of y:

Let me set t = y, then v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

This is a hyperbola or a straight line?

Wait, solving for t:

v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

Multiply both sides by (4t +1):

v(4t +1 ) = t -2

4v t + v = t -2

4v t - t = -2 - v

t(4v -1 ) = - (2 + v )

Therefore,

t = - (2 + v ) / (4v -1 )

This shows that for each v ≠ 1/4, there&#x27;s a corresponding t. But this parametrization covers all real numbers except v = 1/4, which would require the denominator 4v -1 =0, i.e., v=1/4. When v approaches 1/4, t approaches infinity.

But the image is the set of all points (0, v) where v can be any real number except v=1/4. Wait, but in reality, when t approaches infinity, v = (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t/(4t ) = 1/4. So, as t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4 from below. Similarly, when t approaches -1/4 from the right, denominator approaches zero, and v approaches ± infinity depending on the direction.

Wait, let&#x27;s analyze the function v(t) = (t -2)/(4t +1 )

Find the range of v(t):

As t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4.

As t approaches -1/4 from above, denominator approaches 0+, numerator approaches (-1/4 - 2 )= -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0+ = -infty.

As t approaches -1/4 from below, denominator approaches 0-, numerator approaches -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0- = +infty.

At t = 2, v=0.

Therefore, the function v(t) maps:

t ∈ (-∞, -1/4 ) to v ∈ (1/4, +infty ) (wait, hold on):

Wait, let&#x27;s check:

For t &lt; -1/4:

Denominator 4t +1 &lt; 0.

Numerator t -2: If t approaches -infty, t -2 approaches -infty.

So for t &lt; -1/4:

v = (negative)/(negative) = positive.

As t approaches -infty, v ≈ t /4t = 1/4. So from above.

Wait, as t approaches -infty, (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t /4t = 1/4, approaching 1/4 from above? Wait:

Let me compute the limit as t approaches -infty:

(t -2)/(4t +1 ) = [ t (1 - 2/t ) ] / [ t (4 + 1/t ) ] = (1 - 0)/(4 +0 ) = 1/4. So as t approaches -infty, v approaches 1/4 from above (since numerator is negative and denominator is negative, making positive, and when t approaches -infty, the difference from 1/4 is positive). Wait, not sure. Let me plug in t = -N where N is a large positive number:

v = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (N +2)/(4N -1 ) ≈ N /4N = 1/4. So approaching 1/4 from above? Let&#x27;s compute for large N:

(N +2)/(4N -1 ) = [N(1 + 2/N )]/[N(4 -1/N ) ] = (1 + 2/N )/(4 -1/N ) ≈ (1 +0 )/(4 -0 ) = 1/4. So as N increases, the value approaches 1/4 from slightly above? Let&#x27;s take N=1000:

(1000 +2 )/(4000 -1 ) = 1002/3999 ≈ 0.2506, which is slightly more than 1/4. So yes, approaches 1/4 from above.

Similarly, for t approaching -1/4 from the left (t approaching -1/4- ):

t approaching -1/4 from below (t = -1/4 - ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 - ε -2 ) = -9/4 - ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 - ε ) +1 = -1 -4ε +1 = -4ε

So v = (-9/4 - ε )/(-4ε ) = (9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (9/4)/4ε = 9/(16ε ), which approaches +infty as ε→0+.

For t approaching -1/4 from the right (t = -1/4 + ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 + ε -2 ) = -9/4 + ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 + ε ) +1 = -1 +4ε +1 = 4ε

v = (-9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (-9/4)/4ε = -9/(16ε ), which approaches -infty as ε→0+.

At t = 2: v=0.

Therefore, the range of v(t) is:

- When t ∈ (-infty, -1/4 ), v ∈ (1/4, +infty )

- When t ∈ (-1/4, ∞ ), v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 )

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 ) ∪ (1/4, +infty ), i.e., the entire imaginary axis except the point v=1/4. But in the extended complex plane, we include infinity, so the image is the entire imaginary axis (as a line), which makes sense because the pole at z=-i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so the image is a line.

But according to the problem statement, we should map both axes to a circle. This suggests a discrepancy. However, earlier computation showed that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I misinterpreted it. Maybe it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle that the real axis is mapped to, and separately the radius for the imaginary axis? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which seems to imply a single circle. But according to my calculations, they are mapped to different circles (one a finite circle, one a line). This is confusing.

Wait, maybe there&#x27;s a mistake in the computation for the image of the imaginary axis. Let me try a different approach. Instead of parametrizing z = i s, perhaps I should consider the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation f(z) and see if it can be represented as a circle.

The general method for finding the image of a line under a Möbius transformation is to take three points on the original line, find their images, and then determine the circle or line through those points.

Let&#x27;s apply this method to the imaginary axis.

Take three points on the imaginary axis:

1. z = 0: f(0) = 2/i = -2i.

2. z = i: f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

3. z = ∞: The transformation as z approaches ∞ along the imaginary axis: f(z) = (i*z + 2)/(4*z + i) ≈ (i*z)/(4*z) = i/4.

So the three image points are -2i, -i/5, and i/4.

These three points are on the imaginary axis. To determine if they lie on a circle, note that three colinear points (on the same line) lie on an infinite number of circles, but in the standard plane, the only circle that includes them is the line itself, considered as a circle with infinite radius. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line, which is a &quot;circle&quot; with infinite radius. But the problem asks for the radius of the circle, which is finite. Therefore, this suggests that only the real axis is mapped to a circle with finite radius, and the answer should be 9/8.

However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the circle, which contradicts our findings. Therefore, perhaps there&#x27;s an error in the problem or in my solution.

Wait, let&#x27;s cross-verify the image of the real axis. We found that it&#x27;s a circle with center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. Let me check if the images of the real axis include points from the imaginary axis&#x27;s image. For example, take z =0 (on both axes), maps to -2i, which is on the circle (distance from center (0, -7/8) to -2i (0, -2) is | -2 - (-7/8)| = |-16/8 +7/8| = |-9/8| = 9/8, which is the radius. So yes, -2i is on the circle. The point at infinity maps to i/4, which is also on the circle: center (0, -7/8), distance to i/4 (0, 1/4) is |1/4 - (-7/8)| = |1/4 +7/8| = |9/8| =9/8, which is the radius. The images of the real axis include points like i/4 and -2i, which are also images of points on the imaginary axis. Wait, hold on. The image of the real axis includes the point -2i (image of z=0) and i/4 (image of z=∞), which are also images of points on the imaginary axis (z=0 and z=∞). Similarly, images of the imaginary axis include -2i, which is also on the real axis&#x27;s image. Wait, but the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, but the circle we found for the real axis&#x27;s image includes some points on the imaginary axis. Specifically, the circle intersects the imaginary axis at -2i and i/4. But the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, which includes these two points. Therefore, perhaps the problem is referring to the circle that is the image of the real axis, and the image of the imaginary axis is the line that coincides with the imaginary axis, intersecting the circle at -2i and i/4. However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the same circle. Since the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line intersecting that circle at two points, but not the entire circle. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my previous reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary line. Let me check with another point.

Take z = 2i (s=2). Then f(2i) = (i*2i +2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 +2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) =0, which is on the real axis&#x27;s image circle? Let&#x27;s check. The circle has center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. The point 0 is at (0,0). The distance from (0,0) to (0, -7/8) is 7/8, which is less than 9/8, so 0 is inside the circle. Wait, but 0 is the image of z=2i, which is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, 0 is inside the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis includes points inside the circle. But the image of the real axis is the circle itself. So the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary axis, which intersects the circle at -2i and i/4, and passes through 0 inside the circle. Therefore, the two images are different: one is a circle, the other is a line intersecting the circle. So the problem statement must be incorrect, or I have a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem is to find the radius of the circle that both axes are mapped to, implying that both images coincide. In that case, my previous calculation must be wrong.

Wait, let&#x27;s see. The transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let me check if it&#x27;s an involution or has some symmetry. Let me compute f(f(z)):

Compute f(f(z)):

First, f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let&#x27;s substitute w = f(z):

f(w) = (i w +2 )/(4 w +i )

Substitute w = (i z +2)/(4 z +i ):

= [ i*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +2 ] / [4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ]

Simplify numerator:

[ (i^2 z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2 ] = [ (-z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2*(4 z +i )/(4 z +i ) ]

= [ (-z + 2i +8 z +2i )/(4 z +i ) ] = [7 z +4i )/(4 z +i )

Denominator:

[4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ] = [4i z +8 +i*(4 z +i ) ]/(4 z +i )

= [4i z +8 +4i z +i^2 ]/(4 z +i )

= [8i z +8 -1 ]/(4 z +i )

= (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i )

Therefore, f(f(z)) = [ (7 z +4i )/(4 z +i ) ] / [ (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i ) ] = (7 z +4i )/(8i z +7 )

This is not equal to z, so f is not an involution. Therefore, there&#x27;s no immediate symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation maps both axes to the same circle due to some symmetry. But my previous computations do not support this. The real axis maps to a circle, and the imaginary axis maps to a line. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in my solution.

Alternatively, maybe the question is to find the radius for each axis separately. For the real axis, we have radius 9/8. For the imaginary axis, since it&#x27;s mapped to a line, which can be thought of as a circle with infinite radius, but the problem asks for a finite radius. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 9/8.

Given the problem&#x27;s wording, and since the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line (infinite radius), but the problem mentions &quot;the circle&quot;, likely referring to the real axis&#x27;s image, which is a finite circle, the answer should be 9/8.

But to confirm, let&#x27;s see if any other references or methods can show that both images are the same circle.

Alternatively, suppose we consider the transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i )

Let me check if it maps the real axis to a circle and the imaginary axis to the same circle.

From previous calculations, the real axis maps to a circle with center (0, -7/8 ) and radius 9/8. The imaginary axis maps to the imaginary line, which intersects this circle at -2i and i/4. The points -2i and i/4 are both on the circle, as:

Distance from -2i (0, -2) to center (0, -7/8 ) is | -2 - (-7/8 ) | = |-9/8 | =9/8.

Distance from i/4 (0, 1/4 ) to center (0, -7/8 ) is |1/4 - (-7/8 ) | = |9/8 | =9/8.

But the rest of the imaginary axis is not on the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis is the line passing through -2i and i/4 and extending to infinity, which is the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is not the same as the image of the real axis, unless we consider the extended line as a circle, which has infinite radius.

Given that the problem asks for the radius of the circle, expecting a finite number, and given that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, I think the answer is 9/8.

Therefore, the radius is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the circle is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes, we analyze the images of these axes under the transformation.

### Image of the Real Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \) where \( t \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = t \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i}
   \]
3. **Separating Real and Imaginary Parts**:
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
   This gives the parametric equations:
   \[
   u(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1}, \quad v(t) = \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
4. **Finding the Circle**:
   - By eliminating the parameter \( t \), we find that the image lies on a circle.
   - The circle&#x27;s center is found to be \( (0, -\frac{7}{8}) \) and the radius is calculated as \( \frac{9}{8} \).

### Image of the Imaginary Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = is \) where \( s \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = is \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(is) = \frac{-s + 2}{i(4s + 1)}
   \]
3. **Simplifying**:
   - This results in purely imaginary numbers, indicating the image is a line (the imaginary axis in the complex plane).

### Conclusion
The real axis is mapped to a circle with radius \( \frac{9}{8} \). The imaginary axis is mapped to a line, which in the extended complex plane can be considered a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem specifies a finite radius, so we conclude the radius of the circle onto which the real axis is mapped is the answer.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of the circle that the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes onto. Hmm, bilinear transformations, also known as Möbius transformations, right? They have some properties like mapping circles and lines to circles or lines. Since both the real and imaginary axes are lines in the complex plane, their images under this transformation should be either circles or lines. The problem says &quot;onto the circle,&quot; so I guess both axes are mapped to the same circle? Or maybe each axis is mapped to a circle, and we need to find their radii? Wait, the question says &quot;the circle,&quot; so maybe both are mapped to the same circle? Let me check the wording again: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So, both axes are mapped to the same circle, and we need to find its radius. Alright, that makes sense.

First, let me recall that a bilinear transformation is determined by its action on three points. Also, since it&#x27;s a transformation from the extended complex plane to itself, it can map lines to circles and vice versa. The real and imaginary axes are both lines through the origin, but perpendicular to each other. The transformation \( f(z) \) is given, so maybe I can find images of points on the real axis and the imaginary axis and see what circle they lie on.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the real axis and the imaginary axis, plug them into the transformation, and then find the equation of the image curve, which should be a circle, and then find its radius.

Let me try this approach.

First, let&#x27;s handle the real axis. The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \), where \( t \) is a real number. Then, substitute \( z = t \) into the transformation:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \).

Similarly, the imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = i s \), where \( s \) is a real number. Substituting \( z = i s \):

\( f(i s) = \frac{i (i s) + 2}{4 (i s) + i} = \frac{-s + 2}{4 i s + i} = \frac{(-s + 2)}{i (4 s + 1)} \).

Let me compute both images and see if they lie on the same circle.

Starting with the real axis:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \). Let me write this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let me denote \( f(t) = u + iv \).

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize:

Denominator: \( 4 t + i \), conjugate is \( 4 t - i \).

So,

\( f(t) = \frac{(i t + 2)(4 t - i)}{(4 t + i)(4 t - i)} \).

Compute the denominator first:

\( (4 t)^2 - (i)^2 = 16 t^2 - (-1) = 16 t^2 + 1 \).

Numerator:

Expand \( (i t + 2)(4 t - i) \):

First term: \( i t \cdot 4 t = 4 i t^2 \)

Second term: \( i t \cdot (-i) = -i^2 t = -(-1) t = t \)

Third term: \( 2 \cdot 4 t = 8 t \)

Fourth term: \( 2 \cdot (-i) = -2 i \)

So combining all terms:

\( 4 i t^2 + t + 8 t - 2 i = 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \).

Therefore, the numerator is \( 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \), and the denominator is \( 16 t^2 + 1 \).

So, separating into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( 9 t / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Imaginary part: \( (4 t^2 - 2) / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Therefore, \( f(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \).

So, parametrizing the image of the real axis as \( (u(t), v(t)) \), where:

\( u(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

\( v(t) = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

Now, to find the equation of the circle that these points lie on, I can try to eliminate the parameter \( t \) from the equations for \( u \) and \( v \).

Let me set:

\( u = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (1)

\( v = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (2)

Let me solve equation (1) for \( t \):

From (1):

\( u (16 t^2 + 1) = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 + u = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 - 9 t + u = 0 \)

This is a quadratic equation in \( t \), but maybe it&#x27;s messy to solve for \( t \). Alternatively, let me express \( t \) from equation (1) in terms of \( u \), but it&#x27;s a quadratic, so maybe another approach.

Alternatively, notice that from equation (2), we can express \( 16 t^2 + 1 \) as denominator, so let me denote \( D = 16 t^2 + 1 \). Then:

\( u = 9 t / D \)

\( v = (4 t^2 - 2)/D \)

Then, let&#x27;s compute \( u^2 + v^2 \):

\( u^2 + v^2 = (81 t^2 + (4 t^2 - 2)^2) / D^2 \)

Compute numerator:

\( 81 t^2 + (16 t^4 - 16 t^2 + 4) = 16 t^4 + (81 t^2 - 16 t^2) + 4 = 16 t^4 + 65 t^2 + 4 \)

But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, express \( t \) in terms of \( u \) and substitute into \( v \).

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider that the image lies on a circle, so its equation can be written as \( (u - a)^2 + (v - b)^2 = r^2 \). We need to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( r \).

But since both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to the same circle, we might need to consider points from both images to determine the circle. Alternatively, maybe each axis maps to a circle, and both circles have the same radius? Wait, the problem states &quot;the circle&quot;, so perhaps both axes are mapped to the same circle. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the image of each axis is a circle, and we have to find the radius of each? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes,&quot; which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle, so their images coincide as a circle. Let me check with specific points.

First, check some points on the real axis and see where they are mapped.

Take z = 0 (on real axis): f(0) = (i*0 + 2)/(4*0 + i) = 2 / i = -2i.

Take z = ∞ (on extended real axis): The limit as t approaches ∞ of f(t) = (i t + 2)/(4 t + i) ≈ (i t)/(4 t) = i/4. So f(∞) = i/4.

Take z = 1: f(1) = (i + 2)/(4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 - i):

Numerator: (i + 2)(4 - i) = 4i - i^2 + 8 - 2i = (4i - 2i) + ( -i^2 +8 ) = 2i + 1 +8 = 2i +9

Denominator: (4 + i)(4 - i) = 16 - i^2 = 17

Thus, f(1) = (9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (9/17, 2/17)

Similarly, take z = -1: f(-1) = (-i + 2)/(-4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (-4 - i):

Numerator: (-i + 2)(-4 - i) = (-i)(-4) + (-i)(-i) + 2*(-4) + 2*(-i) = 4i + i^2 -8 -2i = (4i - 2i) + (-1 -8) = 2i -9

Denominator: (-4 + i)(-4 -i) = 16 - (i)^2 = 17

Thus, f(-1) = (-9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (-9/17, 2/17)

So these points are on the image of the real axis. Similarly, the points when z approaches 0 and ∞ are -2i and i/4. So plotting these points: -2i, i/4, (9/17, 2/17), (-9/17, 2/17). Hmm, these points seem to lie on a circle. Let&#x27;s check if they lie on the same circle.

First, let&#x27;s check if points -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17) lie on a circle.

A circle in the complex plane can be represented as |w - c| = r, where c is the center and r is the radius.

Let me consider three points: -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17).

First, represent these points in coordinates:

-2i is (0, -2)

i/4 is (0, 1/4)

(9/17, 2/17) is (9/17, 2/17)

So, three points: (0, -2), (0, 1/4), (9/17, 2/17)

We need to find the circle passing through these three points.

Let me denote the circle equation as \( (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Plugging in the three points:

1. For (0, -2):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (-2 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

2. For (0, 1/4):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (1/4 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

3. For (9/17, 2/17):

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

\( [a^2 + (b + 2)^2] - [a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( (b + 2)^2 - (b - 1/4)^2 = 0 \)

Expand both squares:

\( [b^2 +4b +4] - [b^2 - (1/2)b + 1/16] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( b^2 +4b +4 -b^2 + (1/2)b -1/16 = 0 \)

Combine like terms:

\( (4b + (1/2)b) + (4 - 1/16) = 0 \)

\( (9/2)b + (63/16) = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:

\( 72b + 63 = 0 \)

=&gt; 72b = -63 =&gt; b = -63/72 = -7/8

So, the y-coordinate of the center is -7/8.

Now, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 1:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 + 2 = -7/8 + 16/8 = 9/8

So,

\( a^2 + (9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Similarly, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 2:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 - 2/8 = -9/8

Thus,

\( a^2 + (-9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; same as above, so no new information.

Now, use equation 3 with b = -7/8:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - (-7/8))^2 = r^2 \)

First, compute 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16/136 + 119/136) = 135/136

So,

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = r^2 \)

We also have from equation 1: \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Set them equal:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Expand the left side:

\( (81/289 - (18/17)a + a^2) + (18225/18496) = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Simplify:

\( a^2 - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Cancel \( a^2 \):

\( - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = 81/64 \)

Multiply all terms by 18496 (which is 17^2 * 16^2) to eliminate denominators:

Let&#x27;s compute each term:

- (18/17)a * 18496 = -18 * 18496 /17 * a = -18*1088*a = -19584 a

81/289 *18496 = 81 * (18496 /289) = 81 * 64 = 5184

18225/18496 *18496 = 18225

81/64 *18496 = 81 * 18496 /64 = 81 * 289 = 23409

So the equation becomes:

-19584a + 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Compute 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Thus:

-19584a + 23409 = 23409

Subtract 23409:

-19584a = 0 =&gt; a = 0

Therefore, the center is at (0, -7/8) and radius squared is \( a^2 + 81/64 = 81/64 \), so radius is 9/8.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Wait, but let&#x27;s check if the point (9/17, 2/17) lies on this circle.

Center is (0, -7/8), radius 9/8.

Compute distance from (9/17, 2/17) to (0, -7/8):

Difference in x: 9/17 - 0 = 9/17

Difference in y: 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16 + 119)/136 = 135/136

Compute the distance squared:

(9/17)^2 + (135/136)^2

= 81/289 + 18225/18496

Convert to common denominator:

81/289 = (81 * 64)/ (289 * 64) = 5184/18496

18225/18496

Sum: 5184 + 18225 = 23409 /18496 = (153)^2 / (136)^2 = (153/136)^2

But 153 = 9*17, 136 = 8*17, so 153/136 = 9/8. Hence, distance squared is (9/8)^2, so distance is 9/8, which matches the radius. So, yes, the point is on the circle.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Now, let&#x27;s check the image of the imaginary axis. Earlier, we parametrized z = i s, so:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } \)

Let me simplify this expression.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s + 1)(-i) } \)

Wait, denominator: i*(4s +1)*(-i) = -i^2*(4s +1) = (1)*(4s +1) = 4s +1.

Numerator: (-s + 2)(-i) = (s - 2)i

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \)

So, written as \( u + iv \), this is:

\( u = 0 \), \( v = \frac{ s - 2 }{ 4s +1 } \)

Wait, hold on: Wait, if \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then the real part is 0 and the imaginary part is \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), right? Because multiplying by i gives a purely imaginary number.

Wait, but no: Let me check again. If we have \( \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then that&#x27;s equal to \( i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is a purely imaginary number. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points \( 0 + i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is the imaginary axis in the complex plane? But parametrized by s. Wait, but s is real, except when 4s +1 =0, i.e., s = -1/4, which would be a point at infinity.

But hold on, the image is a subset of the imaginary axis? But that can&#x27;t be, since the problem states that the transformation maps the axes to a circle. But according to this, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let&#x27;s recast the computation of f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis.

Given \( z = i s \), then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i} = \frac{ -s + 2 }{4i s + i } \)

Factor out i from the denominator:

\( \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } = \frac{ (-s + 2) }{i (4 s + 1)} \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1) } \)

Because denominator: \( i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1 \), so denominator becomes \( (4 s +1) \)

So, numerator is \( (s - 2)i \), so \( f(z) = \frac{(s - 2)i}{4 s +1 } \)

Therefore, this is a purely imaginary number scaled by \( \frac{(s - 2)}{4 s +1 } \). So the image is the imaginary axis? But parametrized with a real parameter s. Wait, but except when 4 s +1 =0, which would be s = -1/4, but as s approaches -1/4, the image goes to infinity.

But the imaginary axis is a line, not a circle. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. But since bilinear transformations map circles and lines to circles or lines, the image of the imaginary axis under this transformation is either a line or a circle. But according to this computation, it&#x27;s the imaginary axis, which is a line. But the problem states that it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So if the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line, then they can&#x27;t both be mapped to the same circle. But according to the problem statement, it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle onto which both axes are mapped. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my computation.

Wait, let&#x27;s re-examine the transformation. The transformation is \( f(z) = \frac{ i z + 2 }{4 z + i } \). Let me check if it&#x27;s invertible. The determinant of the coefficients matrix is (i)(i) - (2)(4) = (-1) - 8 = -9 ≠ 0, so it&#x27;s invertible.

Wait, when I computed the image of the imaginary axis, I substituted z = i s and found that f(z) is purely imaginary. But that would imply the image is the imaginary axis, but that contradicts the problem&#x27;s statement. Hmm. So perhaps my error is in the calculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s recompute the image of z = i s:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i } \)

Compute numerator: \( i^2 s + 2 = -s + 2 \)

Denominator: \( 4i s + i = i(4 s +1 ) \)

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i(4 s + 1) } \)

To express this in terms of real and imaginary parts, we can multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i(4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1 ) } \)

Since the denominator was multiplied by -i, which is the conjugate of i, to make it real.

Thus, the result is \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s +1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). So, as s varies over real numbers (excluding s = -1/4), the image is all purely imaginary numbers except when s approaches -1/4, which would approach infinity.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under f(z) is the imaginary axis in the w-plane, plus the point at infinity. But in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem states that both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to a circle. But according to the computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8 and center at (0, -7/8), while the imaginary axis is mapped to the imaginary line (which is a circle through infinity). Therefore, there must be an error here.

But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;. Maybe the problem is that in the finite plane, the image of the imaginary axis is a line, but perhaps when considering the extended complex plane, the line together with the point at infinity forms a circle. However, in that case, the radius would be infinite, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I have a miscalculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s check with specific points on the imaginary axis.

Take z = 0 (on imaginary axis? Wait, z=0 is on both axes, but in the parametrization z = i s, when s = 0, we get z=0. Then f(0) = 2/i = -2i, which is the same as before.

Take z = i (s=1): f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

Take z = 2i (s=2): f(2i) = (i*2i + 2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 + 2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) = 0.

Take z = i/2 (s=1/2): f(i/2) = (i*(i/2) +2)/(4*(i/2) +i) = (-1/2 + 2)/(2i +i) = (3/2)/(3i) = (3/2)/(3i) = 1/(2i) = -i/2.

Take z approaching infinity along the imaginary axis: s approaches infinity, so f(z) = ( -s + 2 ) / (4i s +i ) ≈ -s / 4i s = -1/(4i) = i/4.

So the images are: -2i, -i/5, 0, -i/2, and i/4. These points are all on the imaginary axis. So when s approaches infinity, f(z) approaches i/4, which is a finite point. When s approaches -1/4, the denominator 4s +1 approaches zero, so f(z) approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which in the extended complex plane is a circle. But in the standard complex plane, it&#x27;s a line. However, since Möbius transformations map lines to circles or lines, depending on whether they pass through the pole of the transformation.

But in our case, the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is not on the imaginary axis (since the imaginary axis is z = iy, and -i/4 is on the imaginary axis). Wait, z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis. Wait, the denominator 4z +i =0 when z = -i/4. Therefore, the point z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, and thus the transformation has a pole there. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation should be a circle, because the pole is on the original axis, so the image is a circle.

But according to the previous computation, the image seems to be the entire imaginary axis. But that contradicts. Wait, perhaps there&#x27;s a mistake here.

Wait, if the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is on the imaginary axis, then the image of the imaginary axis should be a circle in the extended complex plane. However, when we parameterized it, we obtained the entire imaginary axis except for the point at s = -1/4, which maps to infinity. Therefore, in the extended complex plane, the image is the imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which is a &quot;circle&quot; passing through infinity, i.e., a line. But according to Möbius transformation properties, if the original line passes through the pole, then the image is a line; otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle. Wait, maybe that&#x27;s the key.

Wait, the general property is that Möbius transformations map circles and lines to circles and lines. A line can be considered a circle passing through infinity. If the original line passes through the pole of the transformation (the point where the denominator is zero), then the image will pass through infinity, hence it&#x27;s a line. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle.

In our case, the real axis does not pass through the pole z = -i/4, since the pole is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle. The imaginary axis does pass through the pole z = -i/4, so its image is a line (the extended line, i.e., a circle passing through infinity).

But the problem states that the transformation maps both the real and imaginary axes onto the same circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Therefore, either the problem is ill-posed, or my computations are wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the image of each axis separately, and both images are circles, but with the same radius? Let me check again.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute the image of the imaginary axis again more carefully.

Parametrizing z = i s, then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (2 - s) }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(z) = \frac{ (2 - s)(-i) }{ (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ 4 s + 1 } \)

Thus, this is equal to \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s + 1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). Therefore, as s varies over ℝ \ { -1/4 }, the image is all imaginary numbers. However, when s approaches -1/4, the denominator approaches zero, so the image approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the extended imaginary axis (including infinity), which is a line in the extended complex plane. But the problem says it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle, which suggests a finite circle.

But according to my previous calculation, the image of the real axis is a circle with radius 9/8. However, the problem mentions &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle. But according to my computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misstated, or I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check another point on the imaginary axis. Take z = -i/4, which is the pole. But z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so it&#x27;s mapped to infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line plus infinity, which is a line in the extended plane. So that can&#x27;t be a circle. However, the problem says &quot;onto the circle&quot;, so maybe the question is actually only referring to the real axis? Or maybe the problem is in error.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation when considering the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s consider another approach. Let&#x27;s suppose that both images are circles. Wait, but we saw that the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line. However, maybe in the extended plane, the line is considered a circle, but the problem is asking for the radius in the standard plane, so only the real axis&#x27;s image is a circle with finite radius, and the imaginary axis&#x27;s image is a line, which has infinite radius. But the problem says &quot;the circle&quot;, so maybe the answer is 9/8, the radius from the real axis image.

But the problem states: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; If both axes are mapped to the same circle, but our calculation shows that the real axis is mapped to a circle and the imaginary axis to a line, there&#x27;s a problem. Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s try parametrizing the image of the imaginary axis again. Suppose I write w = f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis, so z = iy, y ∈ ℝ.

Then, w = (i*(iy) + 2)/(4*(iy) + i) = (-y + 2)/(4iy + i) = (2 - y)/(i(4y +1)).

Let me write w = u + iv.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

w = (2 - y)(-i)/(i(4y +1)(-i)) = (-i(2 - y))/( (4y +1) )

The denominator simplifies to (4y +1) because i*(-i) = 1.

Therefore, w = -i(2 - y)/(4y +1 ) = [ (y - 2)/(4y +1) ] i.

So, w is purely imaginary, with v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ), and u = 0.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ) for real y ≠ -1/4.

To see if this is a circle, we can parametrize v in terms of y:

Let me set t = y, then v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

This is a hyperbola or a straight line?

Wait, solving for t:

v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

Multiply both sides by (4t +1):

v(4t +1 ) = t -2

4v t + v = t -2

4v t - t = -2 - v

t(4v -1 ) = - (2 + v )

Therefore,

t = - (2 + v ) / (4v -1 )

This shows that for each v ≠ 1/4, there&#x27;s a corresponding t. But this parametrization covers all real numbers except v = 1/4, which would require the denominator 4v -1 =0, i.e., v=1/4. When v approaches 1/4, t approaches infinity.

But the image is the set of all points (0, v) where v can be any real number except v=1/4. Wait, but in reality, when t approaches infinity, v = (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t/(4t ) = 1/4. So, as t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4 from below. Similarly, when t approaches -1/4 from the right, denominator approaches zero, and v approaches ± infinity depending on the direction.

Wait, let&#x27;s analyze the function v(t) = (t -2)/(4t +1 )

Find the range of v(t):

As t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4.

As t approaches -1/4 from above, denominator approaches 0+, numerator approaches (-1/4 - 2 )= -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0+ = -infty.

As t approaches -1/4 from below, denominator approaches 0-, numerator approaches -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0- = +infty.

At t = 2, v=0.

Therefore, the function v(t) maps:

t ∈ (-∞, -1/4 ) to v ∈ (1/4, +infty ) (wait, hold on):

Wait, let&#x27;s check:

For t &lt; -1/4:

Denominator 4t +1 &lt; 0.

Numerator t -2: If t approaches -infty, t -2 approaches -infty.

So for t &lt; -1/4:

v = (negative)/(negative) = positive.

As t approaches -infty, v ≈ t /4t = 1/4. So from above.

Wait, as t approaches -infty, (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t /4t = 1/4, approaching 1/4 from above? Wait:

Let me compute the limit as t approaches -infty:

(t -2)/(4t +1 ) = [ t (1 - 2/t ) ] / [ t (4 + 1/t ) ] = (1 - 0)/(4 +0 ) = 1/4. So as t approaches -infty, v approaches 1/4 from above (since numerator is negative and denominator is negative, making positive, and when t approaches -infty, the difference from 1/4 is positive). Wait, not sure. Let me plug in t = -N where N is a large positive number:

v = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (N +2)/(4N -1 ) ≈ N /4N = 1/4. So approaching 1/4 from above? Let&#x27;s compute for large N:

(N +2)/(4N -1 ) = [N(1 + 2/N )]/[N(4 -1/N ) ] = (1 + 2/N )/(4 -1/N ) ≈ (1 +0 )/(4 -0 ) = 1/4. So as N increases, the value approaches 1/4 from slightly above? Let&#x27;s take N=1000:

(1000 +2 )/(4000 -1 ) = 1002/3999 ≈ 0.2506, which is slightly more than 1/4. So yes, approaches 1/4 from above.

Similarly, for t approaching -1/4 from the left (t approaching -1/4- ):

t approaching -1/4 from below (t = -1/4 - ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 - ε -2 ) = -9/4 - ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 - ε ) +1 = -1 -4ε +1 = -4ε

So v = (-9/4 - ε )/(-4ε ) = (9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (9/4)/4ε = 9/(16ε ), which approaches +infty as ε→0+.

For t approaching -1/4 from the right (t = -1/4 + ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 + ε -2 ) = -9/4 + ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 + ε ) +1 = -1 +4ε +1 = 4ε

v = (-9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (-9/4)/4ε = -9/(16ε ), which approaches -infty as ε→0+.

At t = 2: v=0.

Therefore, the range of v(t) is:

- When t ∈ (-infty, -1/4 ), v ∈ (1/4, +infty )

- When t ∈ (-1/4, ∞ ), v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 )

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 ) ∪ (1/4, +infty ), i.e., the entire imaginary axis except the point v=1/4. But in the extended complex plane, we include infinity, so the image is the entire imaginary axis (as a line), which makes sense because the pole at z=-i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so the image is a line.

But according to the problem statement, we should map both axes to a circle. This suggests a discrepancy. However, earlier computation showed that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I misinterpreted it. Maybe it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle that the real axis is mapped to, and separately the radius for the imaginary axis? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which seems to imply a single circle. But according to my calculations, they are mapped to different circles (one a finite circle, one a line). This is confusing.

Wait, maybe there&#x27;s a mistake in the computation for the image of the imaginary axis. Let me try a different approach. Instead of parametrizing z = i s, perhaps I should consider the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation f(z) and see if it can be represented as a circle.

The general method for finding the image of a line under a Möbius transformation is to take three points on the original line, find their images, and then determine the circle or line through those points.

Let&#x27;s apply this method to the imaginary axis.

Take three points on the imaginary axis:

1. z = 0: f(0) = 2/i = -2i.

2. z = i: f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

3. z = ∞: The transformation as z approaches ∞ along the imaginary axis: f(z) = (i*z + 2)/(4*z + i) ≈ (i*z)/(4*z) = i/4.

So the three image points are -2i, -i/5, and i/4.

These three points are on the imaginary axis. To determine if they lie on a circle, note that three colinear points (on the same line) lie on an infinite number of circles, but in the standard plane, the only circle that includes them is the line itself, considered as a circle with infinite radius. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line, which is a &quot;circle&quot; with infinite radius. But the problem asks for the radius of the circle, which is finite. Therefore, this suggests that only the real axis is mapped to a circle with finite radius, and the answer should be 9/8.

However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the circle, which contradicts our findings. Therefore, perhaps there&#x27;s an error in the problem or in my solution.

Wait, let&#x27;s cross-verify the image of the real axis. We found that it&#x27;s a circle with center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. Let me check if the images of the real axis include points from the imaginary axis&#x27;s image. For example, take z =0 (on both axes), maps to -2i, which is on the circle (distance from center (0, -7/8) to -2i (0, -2) is | -2 - (-7/8)| = |-16/8 +7/8| = |-9/8| = 9/8, which is the radius. So yes, -2i is on the circle. The point at infinity maps to i/4, which is also on the circle: center (0, -7/8), distance to i/4 (0, 1/4) is |1/4 - (-7/8)| = |1/4 +7/8| = |9/8| =9/8, which is the radius. The images of the real axis include points like i/4 and -2i, which are also images of points on the imaginary axis. Wait, hold on. The image of the real axis includes the point -2i (image of z=0) and i/4 (image of z=∞), which are also images of points on the imaginary axis (z=0 and z=∞). Similarly, images of the imaginary axis include -2i, which is also on the real axis&#x27;s image. Wait, but the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, but the circle we found for the real axis&#x27;s image includes some points on the imaginary axis. Specifically, the circle intersects the imaginary axis at -2i and i/4. But the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, which includes these two points. Therefore, perhaps the problem is referring to the circle that is the image of the real axis, and the image of the imaginary axis is the line that coincides with the imaginary axis, intersecting the circle at -2i and i/4. However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the same circle. Since the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line intersecting that circle at two points, but not the entire circle. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my previous reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary line. Let me check with another point.

Take z = 2i (s=2). Then f(2i) = (i*2i +2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 +2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) =0, which is on the real axis&#x27;s image circle? Let&#x27;s check. The circle has center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. The point 0 is at (0,0). The distance from (0,0) to (0, -7/8) is 7/8, which is less than 9/8, so 0 is inside the circle. Wait, but 0 is the image of z=2i, which is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, 0 is inside the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis includes points inside the circle. But the image of the real axis is the circle itself. So the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary axis, which intersects the circle at -2i and i/4, and passes through 0 inside the circle. Therefore, the two images are different: one is a circle, the other is a line intersecting the circle. So the problem statement must be incorrect, or I have a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem is to find the radius of the circle that both axes are mapped to, implying that both images coincide. In that case, my previous calculation must be wrong.

Wait, let&#x27;s see. The transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let me check if it&#x27;s an involution or has some symmetry. Let me compute f(f(z)):

Compute f(f(z)):

First, f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let&#x27;s substitute w = f(z):

f(w) = (i w +2 )/(4 w +i )

Substitute w = (i z +2)/(4 z +i ):

= [ i*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +2 ] / [4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ]

Simplify numerator:

[ (i^2 z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2 ] = [ (-z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2*(4 z +i )/(4 z +i ) ]

= [ (-z + 2i +8 z +2i )/(4 z +i ) ] = [7 z +4i )/(4 z +i )

Denominator:

[4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ] = [4i z +8 +i*(4 z +i ) ]/(4 z +i )

= [4i z +8 +4i z +i^2 ]/(4 z +i )

= [8i z +8 -1 ]/(4 z +i )

= (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i )

Therefore, f(f(z)) = [ (7 z +4i )/(4 z +i ) ] / [ (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i ) ] = (7 z +4i )/(8i z +7 )

This is not equal to z, so f is not an involution. Therefore, there&#x27;s no immediate symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation maps both axes to the same circle due to some symmetry. But my previous computations do not support this. The real axis maps to a circle, and the imaginary axis maps to a line. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in my solution.

Alternatively, maybe the question is to find the radius for each axis separately. For the real axis, we have radius 9/8. For the imaginary axis, since it&#x27;s mapped to a line, which can be thought of as a circle with infinite radius, but the problem asks for a finite radius. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 9/8.

Given the problem&#x27;s wording, and since the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line (infinite radius), but the problem mentions &quot;the circle&quot;, likely referring to the real axis&#x27;s image, which is a finite circle, the answer should be 9/8.

But to confirm, let&#x27;s see if any other references or methods can show that both images are the same circle.

Alternatively, suppose we consider the transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i )

Let me check if it maps the real axis to a circle and the imaginary axis to the same circle.

From previous calculations, the real axis maps to a circle with center (0, -7/8 ) and radius 9/8. The imaginary axis maps to the imaginary line, which intersects this circle at -2i and i/4. The points -2i and i/4 are both on the circle, as:

Distance from -2i (0, -2) to center (0, -7/8 ) is | -2 - (-7/8 ) | = |-9/8 | =9/8.

Distance from i/4 (0, 1/4 ) to center (0, -7/8 ) is |1/4 - (-7/8 ) | = |9/8 | =9/8.

But the rest of the imaginary axis is not on the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis is the line passing through -2i and i/4 and extending to infinity, which is the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is not the same as the image of the real axis, unless we consider the extended line as a circle, which has infinite radius.

Given that the problem asks for the radius of the circle, expecting a finite number, and given that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, I think the answer is 9/8.

Therefore, the radius is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the circle is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes, we analyze the images of these axes under the transformation.

### Image of the Real Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \) where \( t \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = t \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i}
   \]
3. **Separating Real and Imaginary Parts**:
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
   This gives the parametric equations:
   \[
   u(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1}, \quad v(t) = \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
4. **Finding the Circle**:
   - By eliminating the parameter \( t \), we find that the image lies on a circle.
   - The circle&#x27;s center is found to be \( (0, -\frac{7}{8}) \) and the radius is calculated as \( \frac{9}{8} \).

### Image of the Imaginary Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = is \) where \( s \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = is \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(is) = \frac{-s + 2}{i(4s + 1)}
   \]
3. **Simplifying**:
   - This results in purely imaginary numbers, indicating the image is a line (the imaginary axis in the complex plane).

### Conclusion
The real axis is mapped to a circle with radius \( \frac{9}{8} \). The imaginary axis is mapped to a line, which in the extended complex plane can be considered a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem specifies a finite radius, so we conclude the radius of the circle onto which the real axis is mapped is the answer.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of the circle that the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes onto. Hmm, bilinear transformations, also known as Möbius transformations, right? They have some properties like mapping circles and lines to circles or lines. Since both the real and imaginary axes are lines in the complex plane, their images under this transformation should be either circles or lines. The problem says &quot;onto the circle,&quot; so I guess both axes are mapped to the same circle? Or maybe each axis is mapped to a circle, and we need to find their radii? Wait, the question says &quot;the circle,&quot; so maybe both are mapped to the same circle? Let me check the wording again: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So, both axes are mapped to the same circle, and we need to find its radius. Alright, that makes sense.

First, let me recall that a bilinear transformation is determined by its action on three points. Also, since it&#x27;s a transformation from the extended complex plane to itself, it can map lines to circles and vice versa. The real and imaginary axes are both lines through the origin, but perpendicular to each other. The transformation \( f(z) \) is given, so maybe I can find images of points on the real axis and the imaginary axis and see what circle they lie on.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the real axis and the imaginary axis, plug them into the transformation, and then find the equation of the image curve, which should be a circle, and then find its radius.

Let me try this approach.

First, let&#x27;s handle the real axis. The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \), where \( t \) is a real number. Then, substitute \( z = t \) into the transformation:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \).

Similarly, the imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = i s \), where \( s \) is a real number. Substituting \( z = i s \):

\( f(i s) = \frac{i (i s) + 2}{4 (i s) + i} = \frac{-s + 2}{4 i s + i} = \frac{(-s + 2)}{i (4 s + 1)} \).

Let me compute both images and see if they lie on the same circle.

Starting with the real axis:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \). Let me write this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let me denote \( f(t) = u + iv \).

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize:

Denominator: \( 4 t + i \), conjugate is \( 4 t - i \).

So,

\( f(t) = \frac{(i t + 2)(4 t - i)}{(4 t + i)(4 t - i)} \).

Compute the denominator first:

\( (4 t)^2 - (i)^2 = 16 t^2 - (-1) = 16 t^2 + 1 \).

Numerator:

Expand \( (i t + 2)(4 t - i) \):

First term: \( i t \cdot 4 t = 4 i t^2 \)

Second term: \( i t \cdot (-i) = -i^2 t = -(-1) t = t \)

Third term: \( 2 \cdot 4 t = 8 t \)

Fourth term: \( 2 \cdot (-i) = -2 i \)

So combining all terms:

\( 4 i t^2 + t + 8 t - 2 i = 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \).

Therefore, the numerator is \( 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \), and the denominator is \( 16 t^2 + 1 \).

So, separating into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( 9 t / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Imaginary part: \( (4 t^2 - 2) / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Therefore, \( f(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \).

So, parametrizing the image of the real axis as \( (u(t), v(t)) \), where:

\( u(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

\( v(t) = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

Now, to find the equation of the circle that these points lie on, I can try to eliminate the parameter \( t \) from the equations for \( u \) and \( v \).

Let me set:

\( u = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (1)

\( v = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (2)

Let me solve equation (1) for \( t \):

From (1):

\( u (16 t^2 + 1) = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 + u = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 - 9 t + u = 0 \)

This is a quadratic equation in \( t \), but maybe it&#x27;s messy to solve for \( t \). Alternatively, let me express \( t \) from equation (1) in terms of \( u \), but it&#x27;s a quadratic, so maybe another approach.

Alternatively, notice that from equation (2), we can express \( 16 t^2 + 1 \) as denominator, so let me denote \( D = 16 t^2 + 1 \). Then:

\( u = 9 t / D \)

\( v = (4 t^2 - 2)/D \)

Then, let&#x27;s compute \( u^2 + v^2 \):

\( u^2 + v^2 = (81 t^2 + (4 t^2 - 2)^2) / D^2 \)

Compute numerator:

\( 81 t^2 + (16 t^4 - 16 t^2 + 4) = 16 t^4 + (81 t^2 - 16 t^2) + 4 = 16 t^4 + 65 t^2 + 4 \)

But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, express \( t \) in terms of \( u \) and substitute into \( v \).

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider that the image lies on a circle, so its equation can be written as \( (u - a)^2 + (v - b)^2 = r^2 \). We need to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( r \).

But since both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to the same circle, we might need to consider points from both images to determine the circle. Alternatively, maybe each axis maps to a circle, and both circles have the same radius? Wait, the problem states &quot;the circle&quot;, so perhaps both axes are mapped to the same circle. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the image of each axis is a circle, and we have to find the radius of each? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes,&quot; which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle, so their images coincide as a circle. Let me check with specific points.

First, check some points on the real axis and see where they are mapped.

Take z = 0 (on real axis): f(0) = (i*0 + 2)/(4*0 + i) = 2 / i = -2i.

Take z = ∞ (on extended real axis): The limit as t approaches ∞ of f(t) = (i t + 2)/(4 t + i) ≈ (i t)/(4 t) = i/4. So f(∞) = i/4.

Take z = 1: f(1) = (i + 2)/(4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 - i):

Numerator: (i + 2)(4 - i) = 4i - i^2 + 8 - 2i = (4i - 2i) + ( -i^2 +8 ) = 2i + 1 +8 = 2i +9

Denominator: (4 + i)(4 - i) = 16 - i^2 = 17

Thus, f(1) = (9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (9/17, 2/17)

Similarly, take z = -1: f(-1) = (-i + 2)/(-4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (-4 - i):

Numerator: (-i + 2)(-4 - i) = (-i)(-4) + (-i)(-i) + 2*(-4) + 2*(-i) = 4i + i^2 -8 -2i = (4i - 2i) + (-1 -8) = 2i -9

Denominator: (-4 + i)(-4 -i) = 16 - (i)^2 = 17

Thus, f(-1) = (-9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (-9/17, 2/17)

So these points are on the image of the real axis. Similarly, the points when z approaches 0 and ∞ are -2i and i/4. So plotting these points: -2i, i/4, (9/17, 2/17), (-9/17, 2/17). Hmm, these points seem to lie on a circle. Let&#x27;s check if they lie on the same circle.

First, let&#x27;s check if points -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17) lie on a circle.

A circle in the complex plane can be represented as |w - c| = r, where c is the center and r is the radius.

Let me consider three points: -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17).

First, represent these points in coordinates:

-2i is (0, -2)

i/4 is (0, 1/4)

(9/17, 2/17) is (9/17, 2/17)

So, three points: (0, -2), (0, 1/4), (9/17, 2/17)

We need to find the circle passing through these three points.

Let me denote the circle equation as \( (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Plugging in the three points:

1. For (0, -2):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (-2 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

2. For (0, 1/4):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (1/4 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

3. For (9/17, 2/17):

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

\( [a^2 + (b + 2)^2] - [a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( (b + 2)^2 - (b - 1/4)^2 = 0 \)

Expand both squares:

\( [b^2 +4b +4] - [b^2 - (1/2)b + 1/16] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( b^2 +4b +4 -b^2 + (1/2)b -1/16 = 0 \)

Combine like terms:

\( (4b + (1/2)b) + (4 - 1/16) = 0 \)

\( (9/2)b + (63/16) = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:

\( 72b + 63 = 0 \)

=&gt; 72b = -63 =&gt; b = -63/72 = -7/8

So, the y-coordinate of the center is -7/8.

Now, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 1:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 + 2 = -7/8 + 16/8 = 9/8

So,

\( a^2 + (9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Similarly, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 2:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 - 2/8 = -9/8

Thus,

\( a^2 + (-9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; same as above, so no new information.

Now, use equation 3 with b = -7/8:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - (-7/8))^2 = r^2 \)

First, compute 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16/136 + 119/136) = 135/136

So,

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = r^2 \)

We also have from equation 1: \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Set them equal:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Expand the left side:

\( (81/289 - (18/17)a + a^2) + (18225/18496) = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Simplify:

\( a^2 - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Cancel \( a^2 \):

\( - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = 81/64 \)

Multiply all terms by 18496 (which is 17^2 * 16^2) to eliminate denominators:

Let&#x27;s compute each term:

- (18/17)a * 18496 = -18 * 18496 /17 * a = -18*1088*a = -19584 a

81/289 *18496 = 81 * (18496 /289) = 81 * 64 = 5184

18225/18496 *18496 = 18225

81/64 *18496 = 81 * 18496 /64 = 81 * 289 = 23409

So the equation becomes:

-19584a + 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Compute 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Thus:

-19584a + 23409 = 23409

Subtract 23409:

-19584a = 0 =&gt; a = 0

Therefore, the center is at (0, -7/8) and radius squared is \( a^2 + 81/64 = 81/64 \), so radius is 9/8.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Wait, but let&#x27;s check if the point (9/17, 2/17) lies on this circle.

Center is (0, -7/8), radius 9/8.

Compute distance from (9/17, 2/17) to (0, -7/8):

Difference in x: 9/17 - 0 = 9/17

Difference in y: 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16 + 119)/136 = 135/136

Compute the distance squared:

(9/17)^2 + (135/136)^2

= 81/289 + 18225/18496

Convert to common denominator:

81/289 = (81 * 64)/ (289 * 64) = 5184/18496

18225/18496

Sum: 5184 + 18225 = 23409 /18496 = (153)^2 / (136)^2 = (153/136)^2

But 153 = 9*17, 136 = 8*17, so 153/136 = 9/8. Hence, distance squared is (9/8)^2, so distance is 9/8, which matches the radius. So, yes, the point is on the circle.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Now, let&#x27;s check the image of the imaginary axis. Earlier, we parametrized z = i s, so:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } \)

Let me simplify this expression.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s + 1)(-i) } \)

Wait, denominator: i*(4s +1)*(-i) = -i^2*(4s +1) = (1)*(4s +1) = 4s +1.

Numerator: (-s + 2)(-i) = (s - 2)i

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \)

So, written as \( u + iv \), this is:

\( u = 0 \), \( v = \frac{ s - 2 }{ 4s +1 } \)

Wait, hold on: Wait, if \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then the real part is 0 and the imaginary part is \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), right? Because multiplying by i gives a purely imaginary number.

Wait, but no: Let me check again. If we have \( \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then that&#x27;s equal to \( i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is a purely imaginary number. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points \( 0 + i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is the imaginary axis in the complex plane? But parametrized by s. Wait, but s is real, except when 4s +1 =0, i.e., s = -1/4, which would be a point at infinity.

But hold on, the image is a subset of the imaginary axis? But that can&#x27;t be, since the problem states that the transformation maps the axes to a circle. But according to this, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let&#x27;s recast the computation of f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis.

Given \( z = i s \), then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i} = \frac{ -s + 2 }{4i s + i } \)

Factor out i from the denominator:

\( \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } = \frac{ (-s + 2) }{i (4 s + 1)} \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1) } \)

Because denominator: \( i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1 \), so denominator becomes \( (4 s +1) \)

So, numerator is \( (s - 2)i \), so \( f(z) = \frac{(s - 2)i}{4 s +1 } \)

Therefore, this is a purely imaginary number scaled by \( \frac{(s - 2)}{4 s +1 } \). So the image is the imaginary axis? But parametrized with a real parameter s. Wait, but except when 4 s +1 =0, which would be s = -1/4, but as s approaches -1/4, the image goes to infinity.

But the imaginary axis is a line, not a circle. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. But since bilinear transformations map circles and lines to circles or lines, the image of the imaginary axis under this transformation is either a line or a circle. But according to this computation, it&#x27;s the imaginary axis, which is a line. But the problem states that it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So if the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line, then they can&#x27;t both be mapped to the same circle. But according to the problem statement, it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle onto which both axes are mapped. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my computation.

Wait, let&#x27;s re-examine the transformation. The transformation is \( f(z) = \frac{ i z + 2 }{4 z + i } \). Let me check if it&#x27;s invertible. The determinant of the coefficients matrix is (i)(i) - (2)(4) = (-1) - 8 = -9 ≠ 0, so it&#x27;s invertible.

Wait, when I computed the image of the imaginary axis, I substituted z = i s and found that f(z) is purely imaginary. But that would imply the image is the imaginary axis, but that contradicts the problem&#x27;s statement. Hmm. So perhaps my error is in the calculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s recompute the image of z = i s:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i } \)

Compute numerator: \( i^2 s + 2 = -s + 2 \)

Denominator: \( 4i s + i = i(4 s +1 ) \)

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i(4 s + 1) } \)

To express this in terms of real and imaginary parts, we can multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i(4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1 ) } \)

Since the denominator was multiplied by -i, which is the conjugate of i, to make it real.

Thus, the result is \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s +1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). So, as s varies over real numbers (excluding s = -1/4), the image is all purely imaginary numbers except when s approaches -1/4, which would approach infinity.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under f(z) is the imaginary axis in the w-plane, plus the point at infinity. But in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem states that both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to a circle. But according to the computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8 and center at (0, -7/8), while the imaginary axis is mapped to the imaginary line (which is a circle through infinity). Therefore, there must be an error here.

But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;. Maybe the problem is that in the finite plane, the image of the imaginary axis is a line, but perhaps when considering the extended complex plane, the line together with the point at infinity forms a circle. However, in that case, the radius would be infinite, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I have a miscalculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s check with specific points on the imaginary axis.

Take z = 0 (on imaginary axis? Wait, z=0 is on both axes, but in the parametrization z = i s, when s = 0, we get z=0. Then f(0) = 2/i = -2i, which is the same as before.

Take z = i (s=1): f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

Take z = 2i (s=2): f(2i) = (i*2i + 2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 + 2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) = 0.

Take z = i/2 (s=1/2): f(i/2) = (i*(i/2) +2)/(4*(i/2) +i) = (-1/2 + 2)/(2i +i) = (3/2)/(3i) = (3/2)/(3i) = 1/(2i) = -i/2.

Take z approaching infinity along the imaginary axis: s approaches infinity, so f(z) = ( -s + 2 ) / (4i s +i ) ≈ -s / 4i s = -1/(4i) = i/4.

So the images are: -2i, -i/5, 0, -i/2, and i/4. These points are all on the imaginary axis. So when s approaches infinity, f(z) approaches i/4, which is a finite point. When s approaches -1/4, the denominator 4s +1 approaches zero, so f(z) approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which in the extended complex plane is a circle. But in the standard complex plane, it&#x27;s a line. However, since Möbius transformations map lines to circles or lines, depending on whether they pass through the pole of the transformation.

But in our case, the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is not on the imaginary axis (since the imaginary axis is z = iy, and -i/4 is on the imaginary axis). Wait, z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis. Wait, the denominator 4z +i =0 when z = -i/4. Therefore, the point z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, and thus the transformation has a pole there. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation should be a circle, because the pole is on the original axis, so the image is a circle.

But according to the previous computation, the image seems to be the entire imaginary axis. But that contradicts. Wait, perhaps there&#x27;s a mistake here.

Wait, if the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is on the imaginary axis, then the image of the imaginary axis should be a circle in the extended complex plane. However, when we parameterized it, we obtained the entire imaginary axis except for the point at s = -1/4, which maps to infinity. Therefore, in the extended complex plane, the image is the imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which is a &quot;circle&quot; passing through infinity, i.e., a line. But according to Möbius transformation properties, if the original line passes through the pole, then the image is a line; otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle. Wait, maybe that&#x27;s the key.

Wait, the general property is that Möbius transformations map circles and lines to circles and lines. A line can be considered a circle passing through infinity. If the original line passes through the pole of the transformation (the point where the denominator is zero), then the image will pass through infinity, hence it&#x27;s a line. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle.

In our case, the real axis does not pass through the pole z = -i/4, since the pole is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle. The imaginary axis does pass through the pole z = -i/4, so its image is a line (the extended line, i.e., a circle passing through infinity).

But the problem states that the transformation maps both the real and imaginary axes onto the same circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Therefore, either the problem is ill-posed, or my computations are wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the image of each axis separately, and both images are circles, but with the same radius? Let me check again.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute the image of the imaginary axis again more carefully.

Parametrizing z = i s, then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (2 - s) }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(z) = \frac{ (2 - s)(-i) }{ (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ 4 s + 1 } \)

Thus, this is equal to \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s + 1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). Therefore, as s varies over ℝ \ { -1/4 }, the image is all imaginary numbers. However, when s approaches -1/4, the denominator approaches zero, so the image approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the extended imaginary axis (including infinity), which is a line in the extended complex plane. But the problem says it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle, which suggests a finite circle.

But according to my previous calculation, the image of the real axis is a circle with radius 9/8. However, the problem mentions &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle. But according to my computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misstated, or I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check another point on the imaginary axis. Take z = -i/4, which is the pole. But z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so it&#x27;s mapped to infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line plus infinity, which is a line in the extended plane. So that can&#x27;t be a circle. However, the problem says &quot;onto the circle&quot;, so maybe the question is actually only referring to the real axis? Or maybe the problem is in error.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation when considering the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s consider another approach. Let&#x27;s suppose that both images are circles. Wait, but we saw that the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line. However, maybe in the extended plane, the line is considered a circle, but the problem is asking for the radius in the standard plane, so only the real axis&#x27;s image is a circle with finite radius, and the imaginary axis&#x27;s image is a line, which has infinite radius. But the problem says &quot;the circle&quot;, so maybe the answer is 9/8, the radius from the real axis image.

But the problem states: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; If both axes are mapped to the same circle, but our calculation shows that the real axis is mapped to a circle and the imaginary axis to a line, there&#x27;s a problem. Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s try parametrizing the image of the imaginary axis again. Suppose I write w = f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis, so z = iy, y ∈ ℝ.

Then, w = (i*(iy) + 2)/(4*(iy) + i) = (-y + 2)/(4iy + i) = (2 - y)/(i(4y +1)).

Let me write w = u + iv.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

w = (2 - y)(-i)/(i(4y +1)(-i)) = (-i(2 - y))/( (4y +1) )

The denominator simplifies to (4y +1) because i*(-i) = 1.

Therefore, w = -i(2 - y)/(4y +1 ) = [ (y - 2)/(4y +1) ] i.

So, w is purely imaginary, with v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ), and u = 0.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ) for real y ≠ -1/4.

To see if this is a circle, we can parametrize v in terms of y:

Let me set t = y, then v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

This is a hyperbola or a straight line?

Wait, solving for t:

v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

Multiply both sides by (4t +1):

v(4t +1 ) = t -2

4v t + v = t -2

4v t - t = -2 - v

t(4v -1 ) = - (2 + v )

Therefore,

t = - (2 + v ) / (4v -1 )

This shows that for each v ≠ 1/4, there&#x27;s a corresponding t. But this parametrization covers all real numbers except v = 1/4, which would require the denominator 4v -1 =0, i.e., v=1/4. When v approaches 1/4, t approaches infinity.

But the image is the set of all points (0, v) where v can be any real number except v=1/4. Wait, but in reality, when t approaches infinity, v = (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t/(4t ) = 1/4. So, as t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4 from below. Similarly, when t approaches -1/4 from the right, denominator approaches zero, and v approaches ± infinity depending on the direction.

Wait, let&#x27;s analyze the function v(t) = (t -2)/(4t +1 )

Find the range of v(t):

As t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4.

As t approaches -1/4 from above, denominator approaches 0+, numerator approaches (-1/4 - 2 )= -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0+ = -infty.

As t approaches -1/4 from below, denominator approaches 0-, numerator approaches -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0- = +infty.

At t = 2, v=0.

Therefore, the function v(t) maps:

t ∈ (-∞, -1/4 ) to v ∈ (1/4, +infty ) (wait, hold on):

Wait, let&#x27;s check:

For t &lt; -1/4:

Denominator 4t +1 &lt; 0.

Numerator t -2: If t approaches -infty, t -2 approaches -infty.

So for t &lt; -1/4:

v = (negative)/(negative) = positive.

As t approaches -infty, v ≈ t /4t = 1/4. So from above.

Wait, as t approaches -infty, (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t /4t = 1/4, approaching 1/4 from above? Wait:

Let me compute the limit as t approaches -infty:

(t -2)/(4t +1 ) = [ t (1 - 2/t ) ] / [ t (4 + 1/t ) ] = (1 - 0)/(4 +0 ) = 1/4. So as t approaches -infty, v approaches 1/4 from above (since numerator is negative and denominator is negative, making positive, and when t approaches -infty, the difference from 1/4 is positive). Wait, not sure. Let me plug in t = -N where N is a large positive number:

v = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (N +2)/(4N -1 ) ≈ N /4N = 1/4. So approaching 1/4 from above? Let&#x27;s compute for large N:

(N +2)/(4N -1 ) = [N(1 + 2/N )]/[N(4 -1/N ) ] = (1 + 2/N )/(4 -1/N ) ≈ (1 +0 )/(4 -0 ) = 1/4. So as N increases, the value approaches 1/4 from slightly above? Let&#x27;s take N=1000:

(1000 +2 )/(4000 -1 ) = 1002/3999 ≈ 0.2506, which is slightly more than 1/4. So yes, approaches 1/4 from above.

Similarly, for t approaching -1/4 from the left (t approaching -1/4- ):

t approaching -1/4 from below (t = -1/4 - ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 - ε -2 ) = -9/4 - ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 - ε ) +1 = -1 -4ε +1 = -4ε

So v = (-9/4 - ε )/(-4ε ) = (9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (9/4)/4ε = 9/(16ε ), which approaches +infty as ε→0+.

For t approaching -1/4 from the right (t = -1/4 + ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 + ε -2 ) = -9/4 + ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 + ε ) +1 = -1 +4ε +1 = 4ε

v = (-9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (-9/4)/4ε = -9/(16ε ), which approaches -infty as ε→0+.

At t = 2: v=0.

Therefore, the range of v(t) is:

- When t ∈ (-infty, -1/4 ), v ∈ (1/4, +infty )

- When t ∈ (-1/4, ∞ ), v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 )

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 ) ∪ (1/4, +infty ), i.e., the entire imaginary axis except the point v=1/4. But in the extended complex plane, we include infinity, so the image is the entire imaginary axis (as a line), which makes sense because the pole at z=-i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so the image is a line.

But according to the problem statement, we should map both axes to a circle. This suggests a discrepancy. However, earlier computation showed that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I misinterpreted it. Maybe it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle that the real axis is mapped to, and separately the radius for the imaginary axis? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which seems to imply a single circle. But according to my calculations, they are mapped to different circles (one a finite circle, one a line). This is confusing.

Wait, maybe there&#x27;s a mistake in the computation for the image of the imaginary axis. Let me try a different approach. Instead of parametrizing z = i s, perhaps I should consider the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation f(z) and see if it can be represented as a circle.

The general method for finding the image of a line under a Möbius transformation is to take three points on the original line, find their images, and then determine the circle or line through those points.

Let&#x27;s apply this method to the imaginary axis.

Take three points on the imaginary axis:

1. z = 0: f(0) = 2/i = -2i.

2. z = i: f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

3. z = ∞: The transformation as z approaches ∞ along the imaginary axis: f(z) = (i*z + 2)/(4*z + i) ≈ (i*z)/(4*z) = i/4.

So the three image points are -2i, -i/5, and i/4.

These three points are on the imaginary axis. To determine if they lie on a circle, note that three colinear points (on the same line) lie on an infinite number of circles, but in the standard plane, the only circle that includes them is the line itself, considered as a circle with infinite radius. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line, which is a &quot;circle&quot; with infinite radius. But the problem asks for the radius of the circle, which is finite. Therefore, this suggests that only the real axis is mapped to a circle with finite radius, and the answer should be 9/8.

However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the circle, which contradicts our findings. Therefore, perhaps there&#x27;s an error in the problem or in my solution.

Wait, let&#x27;s cross-verify the image of the real axis. We found that it&#x27;s a circle with center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. Let me check if the images of the real axis include points from the imaginary axis&#x27;s image. For example, take z =0 (on both axes), maps to -2i, which is on the circle (distance from center (0, -7/8) to -2i (0, -2) is | -2 - (-7/8)| = |-16/8 +7/8| = |-9/8| = 9/8, which is the radius. So yes, -2i is on the circle. The point at infinity maps to i/4, which is also on the circle: center (0, -7/8), distance to i/4 (0, 1/4) is |1/4 - (-7/8)| = |1/4 +7/8| = |9/8| =9/8, which is the radius. The images of the real axis include points like i/4 and -2i, which are also images of points on the imaginary axis. Wait, hold on. The image of the real axis includes the point -2i (image of z=0) and i/4 (image of z=∞), which are also images of points on the imaginary axis (z=0 and z=∞). Similarly, images of the imaginary axis include -2i, which is also on the real axis&#x27;s image. Wait, but the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, but the circle we found for the real axis&#x27;s image includes some points on the imaginary axis. Specifically, the circle intersects the imaginary axis at -2i and i/4. But the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, which includes these two points. Therefore, perhaps the problem is referring to the circle that is the image of the real axis, and the image of the imaginary axis is the line that coincides with the imaginary axis, intersecting the circle at -2i and i/4. However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the same circle. Since the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line intersecting that circle at two points, but not the entire circle. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my previous reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary line. Let me check with another point.

Take z = 2i (s=2). Then f(2i) = (i*2i +2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 +2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) =0, which is on the real axis&#x27;s image circle? Let&#x27;s check. The circle has center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. The point 0 is at (0,0). The distance from (0,0) to (0, -7/8) is 7/8, which is less than 9/8, so 0 is inside the circle. Wait, but 0 is the image of z=2i, which is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, 0 is inside the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis includes points inside the circle. But the image of the real axis is the circle itself. So the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary axis, which intersects the circle at -2i and i/4, and passes through 0 inside the circle. Therefore, the two images are different: one is a circle, the other is a line intersecting the circle. So the problem statement must be incorrect, or I have a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem is to find the radius of the circle that both axes are mapped to, implying that both images coincide. In that case, my previous calculation must be wrong.

Wait, let&#x27;s see. The transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let me check if it&#x27;s an involution or has some symmetry. Let me compute f(f(z)):

Compute f(f(z)):

First, f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let&#x27;s substitute w = f(z):

f(w) = (i w +2 )/(4 w +i )

Substitute w = (i z +2)/(4 z +i ):

= [ i*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +2 ] / [4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ]

Simplify numerator:

[ (i^2 z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2 ] = [ (-z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2*(4 z +i )/(4 z +i ) ]

= [ (-z + 2i +8 z +2i )/(4 z +i ) ] = [7 z +4i )/(4 z +i )

Denominator:

[4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ] = [4i z +8 +i*(4 z +i ) ]/(4 z +i )

= [4i z +8 +4i z +i^2 ]/(4 z +i )

= [8i z +8 -1 ]/(4 z +i )

= (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i )

Therefore, f(f(z)) = [ (7 z +4i )/(4 z +i ) ] / [ (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i ) ] = (7 z +4i )/(8i z +7 )

This is not equal to z, so f is not an involution. Therefore, there&#x27;s no immediate symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation maps both axes to the same circle due to some symmetry. But my previous computations do not support this. The real axis maps to a circle, and the imaginary axis maps to a line. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in my solution.

Alternatively, maybe the question is to find the radius for each axis separately. For the real axis, we have radius 9/8. For the imaginary axis, since it&#x27;s mapped to a line, which can be thought of as a circle with infinite radius, but the problem asks for a finite radius. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 9/8.

Given the problem&#x27;s wording, and since the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line (infinite radius), but the problem mentions &quot;the circle&quot;, likely referring to the real axis&#x27;s image, which is a finite circle, the answer should be 9/8.

But to confirm, let&#x27;s see if any other references or methods can show that both images are the same circle.

Alternatively, suppose we consider the transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i )

Let me check if it maps the real axis to a circle and the imaginary axis to the same circle.

From previous calculations, the real axis maps to a circle with center (0, -7/8 ) and radius 9/8. The imaginary axis maps to the imaginary line, which intersects this circle at -2i and i/4. The points -2i and i/4 are both on the circle, as:

Distance from -2i (0, -2) to center (0, -7/8 ) is | -2 - (-7/8 ) | = |-9/8 | =9/8.

Distance from i/4 (0, 1/4 ) to center (0, -7/8 ) is |1/4 - (-7/8 ) | = |9/8 | =9/8.

But the rest of the imaginary axis is not on the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis is the line passing through -2i and i/4 and extending to infinity, which is the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is not the same as the image of the real axis, unless we consider the extended line as a circle, which has infinite radius.

Given that the problem asks for the radius of the circle, expecting a finite number, and given that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, I think the answer is 9/8.

Therefore, the radius is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the circle is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes, we analyze the images of these axes under the transformation.

### Image of the Real Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \) where \( t \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = t \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i}
   \]
3. **Separating Real and Imaginary Parts**:
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
   This gives the parametric equations:
   \[
   u(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1}, \quad v(t) = \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
4. **Finding the Circle**:
   - By eliminating the parameter \( t \), we find that the image lies on a circle.
   - The circle&#x27;s center is found to be \( (0, -\frac{7}{8}) \) and the radius is calculated as \( \frac{9}{8} \).

### Image of the Imaginary Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = is \) where \( s \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = is \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(is) = \frac{-s + 2}{i(4s + 1)}
   \]
3. **Simplifying**:
   - This results in purely imaginary numbers, indicating the image is a line (the imaginary axis in the complex plane).

### Conclusion
The real axis is mapped to a circle with radius \( \frac{9}{8} \). The imaginary axis is mapped to a line, which in the extended complex plane can be considered a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem specifies a finite radius, so we conclude the radius of the circle onto which the real axis is mapped is the answer.

\boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of the circle that the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes onto. Hmm, bilinear transformations, also known as Möbius transformations, right? They have some properties like mapping circles and lines to circles or lines. Since both the real and imaginary axes are lines in the complex plane, their images under this transformation should be either circles or lines. The problem says &quot;onto the circle,&quot; so I guess both axes are mapped to the same circle? Or maybe each axis is mapped to a circle, and we need to find their radii? Wait, the question says &quot;the circle,&quot; so maybe both are mapped to the same circle? Let me check the wording again: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So, both axes are mapped to the same circle, and we need to find its radius. Alright, that makes sense.

First, let me recall that a bilinear transformation is determined by its action on three points. Also, since it&#x27;s a transformation from the extended complex plane to itself, it can map lines to circles and vice versa. The real and imaginary axes are both lines through the origin, but perpendicular to each other. The transformation \( f(z) \) is given, so maybe I can find images of points on the real axis and the imaginary axis and see what circle they lie on.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the real axis and the imaginary axis, plug them into the transformation, and then find the equation of the image curve, which should be a circle, and then find its radius.

Let me try this approach.

First, let&#x27;s handle the real axis. The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \), where \( t \) is a real number. Then, substitute \( z = t \) into the transformation:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \).

Similarly, the imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = i s \), where \( s \) is a real number. Substituting \( z = i s \):

\( f(i s) = \frac{i (i s) + 2}{4 (i s) + i} = \frac{-s + 2}{4 i s + i} = \frac{(-s + 2)}{i (4 s + 1)} \).

Let me compute both images and see if they lie on the same circle.

Starting with the real axis:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \). Let me write this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let me denote \( f(t) = u + iv \).

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize:

Denominator: \( 4 t + i \), conjugate is \( 4 t - i \).

So,

\( f(t) = \frac{(i t + 2)(4 t - i)}{(4 t + i)(4 t - i)} \).

Compute the denominator first:

\( (4 t)^2 - (i)^2 = 16 t^2 - (-1) = 16 t^2 + 1 \).

Numerator:

Expand \( (i t + 2)(4 t - i) \):

First term: \( i t \cdot 4 t = 4 i t^2 \)

Second term: \( i t \cdot (-i) = -i^2 t = -(-1) t = t \)

Third term: \( 2 \cdot 4 t = 8 t \)

Fourth term: \( 2 \cdot (-i) = -2 i \)

So combining all terms:

\( 4 i t^2 + t + 8 t - 2 i = 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \).

Therefore, the numerator is \( 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \), and the denominator is \( 16 t^2 + 1 \).

So, separating into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( 9 t / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Imaginary part: \( (4 t^2 - 2) / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Therefore, \( f(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \).

So, parametrizing the image of the real axis as \( (u(t), v(t)) \), where:

\( u(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

\( v(t) = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

Now, to find the equation of the circle that these points lie on, I can try to eliminate the parameter \( t \) from the equations for \( u \) and \( v \).

Let me set:

\( u = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (1)

\( v = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (2)

Let me solve equation (1) for \( t \):

From (1):

\( u (16 t^2 + 1) = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 + u = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 - 9 t + u = 0 \)

This is a quadratic equation in \( t \), but maybe it&#x27;s messy to solve for \( t \). Alternatively, let me express \( t \) from equation (1) in terms of \( u \), but it&#x27;s a quadratic, so maybe another approach.

Alternatively, notice that from equation (2), we can express \( 16 t^2 + 1 \) as denominator, so let me denote \( D = 16 t^2 + 1 \). Then:

\( u = 9 t / D \)

\( v = (4 t^2 - 2)/D \)

Then, let&#x27;s compute \( u^2 + v^2 \):

\( u^2 + v^2 = (81 t^2 + (4 t^2 - 2)^2) / D^2 \)

Compute numerator:

\( 81 t^2 + (16 t^4 - 16 t^2 + 4) = 16 t^4 + (81 t^2 - 16 t^2) + 4 = 16 t^4 + 65 t^2 + 4 \)

But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, express \( t \) in terms of \( u \) and substitute into \( v \).

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider that the image lies on a circle, so its equation can be written as \( (u - a)^2 + (v - b)^2 = r^2 \). We need to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( r \).

But since both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to the same circle, we might need to consider points from both images to determine the circle. Alternatively, maybe each axis maps to a circle, and both circles have the same radius? Wait, the problem states &quot;the circle&quot;, so perhaps both axes are mapped to the same circle. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the image of each axis is a circle, and we have to find the radius of each? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes,&quot; which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle, so their images coincide as a circle. Let me check with specific points.

First, check some points on the real axis and see where they are mapped.

Take z = 0 (on real axis): f(0) = (i*0 + 2)/(4*0 + i) = 2 / i = -2i.

Take z = ∞ (on extended real axis): The limit as t approaches ∞ of f(t) = (i t + 2)/(4 t + i) ≈ (i t)/(4 t) = i/4. So f(∞) = i/4.

Take z = 1: f(1) = (i + 2)/(4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 - i):

Numerator: (i + 2)(4 - i) = 4i - i^2 + 8 - 2i = (4i - 2i) + ( -i^2 +8 ) = 2i + 1 +8 = 2i +9

Denominator: (4 + i)(4 - i) = 16 - i^2 = 17

Thus, f(1) = (9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (9/17, 2/17)

Similarly, take z = -1: f(-1) = (-i + 2)/(-4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (-4 - i):

Numerator: (-i + 2)(-4 - i) = (-i)(-4) + (-i)(-i) + 2*(-4) + 2*(-i) = 4i + i^2 -8 -2i = (4i - 2i) + (-1 -8) = 2i -9

Denominator: (-4 + i)(-4 -i) = 16 - (i)^2 = 17

Thus, f(-1) = (-9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (-9/17, 2/17)

So these points are on the image of the real axis. Similarly, the points when z approaches 0 and ∞ are -2i and i/4. So plotting these points: -2i, i/4, (9/17, 2/17), (-9/17, 2/17). Hmm, these points seem to lie on a circle. Let&#x27;s check if they lie on the same circle.

First, let&#x27;s check if points -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17) lie on a circle.

A circle in the complex plane can be represented as |w - c| = r, where c is the center and r is the radius.

Let me consider three points: -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17).

First, represent these points in coordinates:

-2i is (0, -2)

i/4 is (0, 1/4)

(9/17, 2/17) is (9/17, 2/17)

So, three points: (0, -2), (0, 1/4), (9/17, 2/17)

We need to find the circle passing through these three points.

Let me denote the circle equation as \( (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Plugging in the three points:

1. For (0, -2):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (-2 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

2. For (0, 1/4):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (1/4 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

3. For (9/17, 2/17):

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

\( [a^2 + (b + 2)^2] - [a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( (b + 2)^2 - (b - 1/4)^2 = 0 \)

Expand both squares:

\( [b^2 +4b +4] - [b^2 - (1/2)b + 1/16] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( b^2 +4b +4 -b^2 + (1/2)b -1/16 = 0 \)

Combine like terms:

\( (4b + (1/2)b) + (4 - 1/16) = 0 \)

\( (9/2)b + (63/16) = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:

\( 72b + 63 = 0 \)

=&gt; 72b = -63 =&gt; b = -63/72 = -7/8

So, the y-coordinate of the center is -7/8.

Now, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 1:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 + 2 = -7/8 + 16/8 = 9/8

So,

\( a^2 + (9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Similarly, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 2:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 - 2/8 = -9/8

Thus,

\( a^2 + (-9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; same as above, so no new information.

Now, use equation 3 with b = -7/8:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - (-7/8))^2 = r^2 \)

First, compute 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16/136 + 119/136) = 135/136

So,

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = r^2 \)

We also have from equation 1: \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Set them equal:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Expand the left side:

\( (81/289 - (18/17)a + a^2) + (18225/18496) = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Simplify:

\( a^2 - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Cancel \( a^2 \):

\( - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = 81/64 \)

Multiply all terms by 18496 (which is 17^2 * 16^2) to eliminate denominators:

Let&#x27;s compute each term:

- (18/17)a * 18496 = -18 * 18496 /17 * a = -18*1088*a = -19584 a

81/289 *18496 = 81 * (18496 /289) = 81 * 64 = 5184

18225/18496 *18496 = 18225

81/64 *18496 = 81 * 18496 /64 = 81 * 289 = 23409

So the equation becomes:

-19584a + 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Compute 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Thus:

-19584a + 23409 = 23409

Subtract 23409:

-19584a = 0 =&gt; a = 0

Therefore, the center is at (0, -7/8) and radius squared is \( a^2 + 81/64 = 81/64 \), so radius is 9/8.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Wait, but let&#x27;s check if the point (9/17, 2/17) lies on this circle.

Center is (0, -7/8), radius 9/8.

Compute distance from (9/17, 2/17) to (0, -7/8):

Difference in x: 9/17 - 0 = 9/17

Difference in y: 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16 + 119)/136 = 135/136

Compute the distance squared:

(9/17)^2 + (135/136)^2

= 81/289 + 18225/18496

Convert to common denominator:

81/289 = (81 * 64)/ (289 * 64) = 5184/18496

18225/18496

Sum: 5184 + 18225 = 23409 /18496 = (153)^2 / (136)^2 = (153/136)^2

But 153 = 9*17, 136 = 8*17, so 153/136 = 9/8. Hence, distance squared is (9/8)^2, so distance is 9/8, which matches the radius. So, yes, the point is on the circle.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Now, let&#x27;s check the image of the imaginary axis. Earlier, we parametrized z = i s, so:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } \)

Let me simplify this expression.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s + 1)(-i) } \)

Wait, denominator: i*(4s +1)*(-i) = -i^2*(4s +1) = (1)*(4s +1) = 4s +1.

Numerator: (-s + 2)(-i) = (s - 2)i

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \)

So, written as \( u + iv \), this is:

\( u = 0 \), \( v = \frac{ s - 2 }{ 4s +1 } \)

Wait, hold on: Wait, if \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then the real part is 0 and the imaginary part is \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), right? Because multiplying by i gives a purely imaginary number.

Wait, but no: Let me check again. If we have \( \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then that&#x27;s equal to \( i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is a purely imaginary number. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points \( 0 + i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is the imaginary axis in the complex plane? But parametrized by s. Wait, but s is real, except when 4s +1 =0, i.e., s = -1/4, which would be a point at infinity.

But hold on, the image is a subset of the imaginary axis? But that can&#x27;t be, since the problem states that the transformation maps the axes to a circle. But according to this, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let&#x27;s recast the computation of f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis.

Given \( z = i s \), then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i} = \frac{ -s + 2 }{4i s + i } \)

Factor out i from the denominator:

\( \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } = \frac{ (-s + 2) }{i (4 s + 1)} \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1) } \)

Because denominator: \( i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1 \), so denominator becomes \( (4 s +1) \)

So, numerator is \( (s - 2)i \), so \( f(z) = \frac{(s - 2)i}{4 s +1 } \)

Therefore, this is a purely imaginary number scaled by \( \frac{(s - 2)}{4 s +1 } \). So the image is the imaginary axis? But parametrized with a real parameter s. Wait, but except when 4 s +1 =0, which would be s = -1/4, but as s approaches -1/4, the image goes to infinity.

But the imaginary axis is a line, not a circle. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. But since bilinear transformations map circles and lines to circles or lines, the image of the imaginary axis under this transformation is either a line or a circle. But according to this computation, it&#x27;s the imaginary axis, which is a line. But the problem states that it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So if the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line, then they can&#x27;t both be mapped to the same circle. But according to the problem statement, it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle onto which both axes are mapped. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my computation.

Wait, let&#x27;s re-examine the transformation. The transformation is \( f(z) = \frac{ i z + 2 }{4 z + i } \). Let me check if it&#x27;s invertible. The determinant of the coefficients matrix is (i)(i) - (2)(4) = (-1) - 8 = -9 ≠ 0, so it&#x27;s invertible.

Wait, when I computed the image of the imaginary axis, I substituted z = i s and found that f(z) is purely imaginary. But that would imply the image is the imaginary axis, but that contradicts the problem&#x27;s statement. Hmm. So perhaps my error is in the calculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s recompute the image of z = i s:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i } \)

Compute numerator: \( i^2 s + 2 = -s + 2 \)

Denominator: \( 4i s + i = i(4 s +1 ) \)

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i(4 s + 1) } \)

To express this in terms of real and imaginary parts, we can multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i(4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1 ) } \)

Since the denominator was multiplied by -i, which is the conjugate of i, to make it real.

Thus, the result is \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s +1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). So, as s varies over real numbers (excluding s = -1/4), the image is all purely imaginary numbers except when s approaches -1/4, which would approach infinity.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under f(z) is the imaginary axis in the w-plane, plus the point at infinity. But in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem states that both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to a circle. But according to the computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8 and center at (0, -7/8), while the imaginary axis is mapped to the imaginary line (which is a circle through infinity). Therefore, there must be an error here.

But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;. Maybe the problem is that in the finite plane, the image of the imaginary axis is a line, but perhaps when considering the extended complex plane, the line together with the point at infinity forms a circle. However, in that case, the radius would be infinite, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I have a miscalculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s check with specific points on the imaginary axis.

Take z = 0 (on imaginary axis? Wait, z=0 is on both axes, but in the parametrization z = i s, when s = 0, we get z=0. Then f(0) = 2/i = -2i, which is the same as before.

Take z = i (s=1): f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

Take z = 2i (s=2): f(2i) = (i*2i + 2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 + 2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) = 0.

Take z = i/2 (s=1/2): f(i/2) = (i*(i/2) +2)/(4*(i/2) +i) = (-1/2 + 2)/(2i +i) = (3/2)/(3i) = (3/2)/(3i) = 1/(2i) = -i/2.

Take z approaching infinity along the imaginary axis: s approaches infinity, so f(z) = ( -s + 2 ) / (4i s +i ) ≈ -s / 4i s = -1/(4i) = i/4.

So the images are: -2i, -i/5, 0, -i/2, and i/4. These points are all on the imaginary axis. So when s approaches infinity, f(z) approaches i/4, which is a finite point. When s approaches -1/4, the denominator 4s +1 approaches zero, so f(z) approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which in the extended complex plane is a circle. But in the standard complex plane, it&#x27;s a line. However, since Möbius transformations map lines to circles or lines, depending on whether they pass through the pole of the transformation.

But in our case, the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is not on the imaginary axis (since the imaginary axis is z = iy, and -i/4 is on the imaginary axis). Wait, z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis. Wait, the denominator 4z +i =0 when z = -i/4. Therefore, the point z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, and thus the transformation has a pole there. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation should be a circle, because the pole is on the original axis, so the image is a circle.

But according to the previous computation, the image seems to be the entire imaginary axis. But that contradicts. Wait, perhaps there&#x27;s a mistake here.

Wait, if the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is on the imaginary axis, then the image of the imaginary axis should be a circle in the extended complex plane. However, when we parameterized it, we obtained the entire imaginary axis except for the point at s = -1/4, which maps to infinity. Therefore, in the extended complex plane, the image is the imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which is a &quot;circle&quot; passing through infinity, i.e., a line. But according to Möbius transformation properties, if the original line passes through the pole, then the image is a line; otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle. Wait, maybe that&#x27;s the key.

Wait, the general property is that Möbius transformations map circles and lines to circles and lines. A line can be considered a circle passing through infinity. If the original line passes through the pole of the transformation (the point where the denominator is zero), then the image will pass through infinity, hence it&#x27;s a line. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle.

In our case, the real axis does not pass through the pole z = -i/4, since the pole is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle. The imaginary axis does pass through the pole z = -i/4, so its image is a line (the extended line, i.e., a circle passing through infinity).

But the problem states that the transformation maps both the real and imaginary axes onto the same circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Therefore, either the problem is ill-posed, or my computations are wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the image of each axis separately, and both images are circles, but with the same radius? Let me check again.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute the image of the imaginary axis again more carefully.

Parametrizing z = i s, then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (2 - s) }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(z) = \frac{ (2 - s)(-i) }{ (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ 4 s + 1 } \)

Thus, this is equal to \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s + 1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). Therefore, as s varies over ℝ \ { -1/4 }, the image is all imaginary numbers. However, when s approaches -1/4, the denominator approaches zero, so the image approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the extended imaginary axis (including infinity), which is a line in the extended complex plane. But the problem says it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle, which suggests a finite circle.

But according to my previous calculation, the image of the real axis is a circle with radius 9/8. However, the problem mentions &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle. But according to my computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misstated, or I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check another point on the imaginary axis. Take z = -i/4, which is the pole. But z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so it&#x27;s mapped to infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line plus infinity, which is a line in the extended plane. So that can&#x27;t be a circle. However, the problem says &quot;onto the circle&quot;, so maybe the question is actually only referring to the real axis? Or maybe the problem is in error.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation when considering the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s consider another approach. Let&#x27;s suppose that both images are circles. Wait, but we saw that the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line. However, maybe in the extended plane, the line is considered a circle, but the problem is asking for the radius in the standard plane, so only the real axis&#x27;s image is a circle with finite radius, and the imaginary axis&#x27;s image is a line, which has infinite radius. But the problem says &quot;the circle&quot;, so maybe the answer is 9/8, the radius from the real axis image.

But the problem states: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; If both axes are mapped to the same circle, but our calculation shows that the real axis is mapped to a circle and the imaginary axis to a line, there&#x27;s a problem. Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s try parametrizing the image of the imaginary axis again. Suppose I write w = f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis, so z = iy, y ∈ ℝ.

Then, w = (i*(iy) + 2)/(4*(iy) + i) = (-y + 2)/(4iy + i) = (2 - y)/(i(4y +1)).

Let me write w = u + iv.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

w = (2 - y)(-i)/(i(4y +1)(-i)) = (-i(2 - y))/( (4y +1) )

The denominator simplifies to (4y +1) because i*(-i) = 1.

Therefore, w = -i(2 - y)/(4y +1 ) = [ (y - 2)/(4y +1) ] i.

So, w is purely imaginary, with v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ), and u = 0.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ) for real y ≠ -1/4.

To see if this is a circle, we can parametrize v in terms of y:

Let me set t = y, then v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

This is a hyperbola or a straight line?

Wait, solving for t:

v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

Multiply both sides by (4t +1):

v(4t +1 ) = t -2

4v t + v = t -2

4v t - t = -2 - v

t(4v -1 ) = - (2 + v )

Therefore,

t = - (2 + v ) / (4v -1 )

This shows that for each v ≠ 1/4, there&#x27;s a corresponding t. But this parametrization covers all real numbers except v = 1/4, which would require the denominator 4v -1 =0, i.e., v=1/4. When v approaches 1/4, t approaches infinity.

But the image is the set of all points (0, v) where v can be any real number except v=1/4. Wait, but in reality, when t approaches infinity, v = (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t/(4t ) = 1/4. So, as t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4 from below. Similarly, when t approaches -1/4 from the right, denominator approaches zero, and v approaches ± infinity depending on the direction.

Wait, let&#x27;s analyze the function v(t) = (t -2)/(4t +1 )

Find the range of v(t):

As t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4.

As t approaches -1/4 from above, denominator approaches 0+, numerator approaches (-1/4 - 2 )= -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0+ = -infty.

As t approaches -1/4 from below, denominator approaches 0-, numerator approaches -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0- = +infty.

At t = 2, v=0.

Therefore, the function v(t) maps:

t ∈ (-∞, -1/4 ) to v ∈ (1/4, +infty ) (wait, hold on):

Wait, let&#x27;s check:

For t &lt; -1/4:

Denominator 4t +1 &lt; 0.

Numerator t -2: If t approaches -infty, t -2 approaches -infty.

So for t &lt; -1/4:

v = (negative)/(negative) = positive.

As t approaches -infty, v ≈ t /4t = 1/4. So from above.

Wait, as t approaches -infty, (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t /4t = 1/4, approaching 1/4 from above? Wait:

Let me compute the limit as t approaches -infty:

(t -2)/(4t +1 ) = [ t (1 - 2/t ) ] / [ t (4 + 1/t ) ] = (1 - 0)/(4 +0 ) = 1/4. So as t approaches -infty, v approaches 1/4 from above (since numerator is negative and denominator is negative, making positive, and when t approaches -infty, the difference from 1/4 is positive). Wait, not sure. Let me plug in t = -N where N is a large positive number:

v = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (N +2)/(4N -1 ) ≈ N /4N = 1/4. So approaching 1/4 from above? Let&#x27;s compute for large N:

(N +2)/(4N -1 ) = [N(1 + 2/N )]/[N(4 -1/N ) ] = (1 + 2/N )/(4 -1/N ) ≈ (1 +0 )/(4 -0 ) = 1/4. So as N increases, the value approaches 1/4 from slightly above? Let&#x27;s take N=1000:

(1000 +2 )/(4000 -1 ) = 1002/3999 ≈ 0.2506, which is slightly more than 1/4. So yes, approaches 1/4 from above.

Similarly, for t approaching -1/4 from the left (t approaching -1/4- ):

t approaching -1/4 from below (t = -1/4 - ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 - ε -2 ) = -9/4 - ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 - ε ) +1 = -1 -4ε +1 = -4ε

So v = (-9/4 - ε )/(-4ε ) = (9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (9/4)/4ε = 9/(16ε ), which approaches +infty as ε→0+.

For t approaching -1/4 from the right (t = -1/4 + ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 + ε -2 ) = -9/4 + ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 + ε ) +1 = -1 +4ε +1 = 4ε

v = (-9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (-9/4)/4ε = -9/(16ε ), which approaches -infty as ε→0+.

At t = 2: v=0.

Therefore, the range of v(t) is:

- When t ∈ (-infty, -1/4 ), v ∈ (1/4, +infty )

- When t ∈ (-1/4, ∞ ), v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 )

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 ) ∪ (1/4, +infty ), i.e., the entire imaginary axis except the point v=1/4. But in the extended complex plane, we include infinity, so the image is the entire imaginary axis (as a line), which makes sense because the pole at z=-i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so the image is a line.

But according to the problem statement, we should map both axes to a circle. This suggests a discrepancy. However, earlier computation showed that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I misinterpreted it. Maybe it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle that the real axis is mapped to, and separately the radius for the imaginary axis? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which seems to imply a single circle. But according to my calculations, they are mapped to different circles (one a finite circle, one a line). This is confusing.

Wait, maybe there&#x27;s a mistake in the computation for the image of the imaginary axis. Let me try a different approach. Instead of parametrizing z = i s, perhaps I should consider the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation f(z) and see if it can be represented as a circle.

The general method for finding the image of a line under a Möbius transformation is to take three points on the original line, find their images, and then determine the circle or line through those points.

Let&#x27;s apply this method to the imaginary axis.

Take three points on the imaginary axis:

1. z = 0: f(0) = 2/i = -2i.

2. z = i: f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

3. z = ∞: The transformation as z approaches ∞ along the imaginary axis: f(z) = (i*z + 2)/(4*z + i) ≈ (i*z)/(4*z) = i/4.

So the three image points are -2i, -i/5, and i/4.

These three points are on the imaginary axis. To determine if they lie on a circle, note that three colinear points (on the same line) lie on an infinite number of circles, but in the standard plane, the only circle that includes them is the line itself, considered as a circle with infinite radius. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line, which is a &quot;circle&quot; with infinite radius. But the problem asks for the radius of the circle, which is finite. Therefore, this suggests that only the real axis is mapped to a circle with finite radius, and the answer should be 9/8.

However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the circle, which contradicts our findings. Therefore, perhaps there&#x27;s an error in the problem or in my solution.

Wait, let&#x27;s cross-verify the image of the real axis. We found that it&#x27;s a circle with center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. Let me check if the images of the real axis include points from the imaginary axis&#x27;s image. For example, take z =0 (on both axes), maps to -2i, which is on the circle (distance from center (0, -7/8) to -2i (0, -2) is | -2 - (-7/8)| = |-16/8 +7/8| = |-9/8| = 9/8, which is the radius. So yes, -2i is on the circle. The point at infinity maps to i/4, which is also on the circle: center (0, -7/8), distance to i/4 (0, 1/4) is |1/4 - (-7/8)| = |1/4 +7/8| = |9/8| =9/8, which is the radius. The images of the real axis include points like i/4 and -2i, which are also images of points on the imaginary axis. Wait, hold on. The image of the real axis includes the point -2i (image of z=0) and i/4 (image of z=∞), which are also images of points on the imaginary axis (z=0 and z=∞). Similarly, images of the imaginary axis include -2i, which is also on the real axis&#x27;s image. Wait, but the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, but the circle we found for the real axis&#x27;s image includes some points on the imaginary axis. Specifically, the circle intersects the imaginary axis at -2i and i/4. But the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, which includes these two points. Therefore, perhaps the problem is referring to the circle that is the image of the real axis, and the image of the imaginary axis is the line that coincides with the imaginary axis, intersecting the circle at -2i and i/4. However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the same circle. Since the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line intersecting that circle at two points, but not the entire circle. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my previous reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary line. Let me check with another point.

Take z = 2i (s=2). Then f(2i) = (i*2i +2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 +2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) =0, which is on the real axis&#x27;s image circle? Let&#x27;s check. The circle has center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. The point 0 is at (0,0). The distance from (0,0) to (0, -7/8) is 7/8, which is less than 9/8, so 0 is inside the circle. Wait, but 0 is the image of z=2i, which is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, 0 is inside the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis includes points inside the circle. But the image of the real axis is the circle itself. So the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary axis, which intersects the circle at -2i and i/4, and passes through 0 inside the circle. Therefore, the two images are different: one is a circle, the other is a line intersecting the circle. So the problem statement must be incorrect, or I have a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem is to find the radius of the circle that both axes are mapped to, implying that both images coincide. In that case, my previous calculation must be wrong.

Wait, let&#x27;s see. The transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let me check if it&#x27;s an involution or has some symmetry. Let me compute f(f(z)):

Compute f(f(z)):

First, f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let&#x27;s substitute w = f(z):

f(w) = (i w +2 )/(4 w +i )

Substitute w = (i z +2)/(4 z +i ):

= [ i*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +2 ] / [4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ]

Simplify numerator:

[ (i^2 z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2 ] = [ (-z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2*(4 z +i )/(4 z +i ) ]

= [ (-z + 2i +8 z +2i )/(4 z +i ) ] = [7 z +4i )/(4 z +i )

Denominator:

[4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ] = [4i z +8 +i*(4 z +i ) ]/(4 z +i )

= [4i z +8 +4i z +i^2 ]/(4 z +i )

= [8i z +8 -1 ]/(4 z +i )

= (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i )

Therefore, f(f(z)) = [ (7 z +4i )/(4 z +i ) ] / [ (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i ) ] = (7 z +4i )/(8i z +7 )

This is not equal to z, so f is not an involution. Therefore, there&#x27;s no immediate symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation maps both axes to the same circle due to some symmetry. But my previous computations do not support this. The real axis maps to a circle, and the imaginary axis maps to a line. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in my solution.

Alternatively, maybe the question is to find the radius for each axis separately. For the real axis, we have radius 9/8. For the imaginary axis, since it&#x27;s mapped to a line, which can be thought of as a circle with infinite radius, but the problem asks for a finite radius. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 9/8.

Given the problem&#x27;s wording, and since the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line (infinite radius), but the problem mentions &quot;the circle&quot;, likely referring to the real axis&#x27;s image, which is a finite circle, the answer should be 9/8.

But to confirm, let&#x27;s see if any other references or methods can show that both images are the same circle.

Alternatively, suppose we consider the transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i )

Let me check if it maps the real axis to a circle and the imaginary axis to the same circle.

From previous calculations, the real axis maps to a circle with center (0, -7/8 ) and radius 9/8. The imaginary axis maps to the imaginary line, which intersects this circle at -2i and i/4. The points -2i and i/4 are both on the circle, as:

Distance from -2i (0, -2) to center (0, -7/8 ) is | -2 - (-7/8 ) | = |-9/8 | =9/8.

Distance from i/4 (0, 1/4 ) to center (0, -7/8 ) is |1/4 - (-7/8 ) | = |9/8 | =9/8.

But the rest of the imaginary axis is not on the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis is the line passing through -2i and i/4 and extending to infinity, which is the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is not the same as the image of the real axis, unless we consider the extended line as a circle, which has infinite radius.

Given that the problem asks for the radius of the circle, expecting a finite number, and given that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, I think the answer is 9/8.

Therefore, the radius is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the circle is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes, we analyze the images of these axes under the transformation.

### Image of the Real Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \) where \( t \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = t \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i}
   \]
3. **Separating Real and Imaginary Parts**:
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
   This gives the parametric equations:
   \[
   u(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1}, \quad v(t) = \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
4. **Finding the Circle**:
   - By eliminating the parameter \( t \), we find that the image lies on a circle.
   - The circle&#x27;s center is found to be \( (0, -\frac{7}{8}) \) and the radius is calculated as \( \frac{9}{8} \).

### Image of the Imaginary Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = is \) where \( s \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = is \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(is) = \frac{-s + 2}{i(4s + 1)}
   \]
3. **Simplifying**:
   - This results in purely imaginary numbers, indicating the image is a line (the imaginary axis in the complex plane).

### Conclusion
The real axis is mapped to a circle with radius \( \frac{9}{8} \). The imaginary axis is mapped to a line, which in the extended complex plane can be considered a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem specifies a finite radius, so we conclude the radius of the circle onto which the real axis is mapped is the answer.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of the circle that the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes onto. Hmm, bilinear transformations, also known as Möbius transformations, right? They have some properties like mapping circles and lines to circles or lines. Since both the real and imaginary axes are lines in the complex plane, their images under this transformation should be either circles or lines. The problem says &quot;onto the circle,&quot; so I guess both axes are mapped to the same circle? Or maybe each axis is mapped to a circle, and we need to find their radii? Wait, the question says &quot;the circle,&quot; so maybe both are mapped to the same circle? Let me check the wording again: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So, both axes are mapped to the same circle, and we need to find its radius. Alright, that makes sense.

First, let me recall that a bilinear transformation is determined by its action on three points. Also, since it&#x27;s a transformation from the extended complex plane to itself, it can map lines to circles and vice versa. The real and imaginary axes are both lines through the origin, but perpendicular to each other. The transformation \( f(z) \) is given, so maybe I can find images of points on the real axis and the imaginary axis and see what circle they lie on.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the real axis and the imaginary axis, plug them into the transformation, and then find the equation of the image curve, which should be a circle, and then find its radius.

Let me try this approach.

First, let&#x27;s handle the real axis. The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \), where \( t \) is a real number. Then, substitute \( z = t \) into the transformation:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \).

Similarly, the imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = i s \), where \( s \) is a real number. Substituting \( z = i s \):

\( f(i s) = \frac{i (i s) + 2}{4 (i s) + i} = \frac{-s + 2}{4 i s + i} = \frac{(-s + 2)}{i (4 s + 1)} \).

Let me compute both images and see if they lie on the same circle.

Starting with the real axis:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \). Let me write this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let me denote \( f(t) = u + iv \).

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize:

Denominator: \( 4 t + i \), conjugate is \( 4 t - i \).

So,

\( f(t) = \frac{(i t + 2)(4 t - i)}{(4 t + i)(4 t - i)} \).

Compute the denominator first:

\( (4 t)^2 - (i)^2 = 16 t^2 - (-1) = 16 t^2 + 1 \).

Numerator:

Expand \( (i t + 2)(4 t - i) \):

First term: \( i t \cdot 4 t = 4 i t^2 \)

Second term: \( i t \cdot (-i) = -i^2 t = -(-1) t = t \)

Third term: \( 2 \cdot 4 t = 8 t \)

Fourth term: \( 2 \cdot (-i) = -2 i \)

So combining all terms:

\( 4 i t^2 + t + 8 t - 2 i = 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \).

Therefore, the numerator is \( 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \), and the denominator is \( 16 t^2 + 1 \).

So, separating into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( 9 t / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Imaginary part: \( (4 t^2 - 2) / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Therefore, \( f(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \).

So, parametrizing the image of the real axis as \( (u(t), v(t)) \), where:

\( u(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

\( v(t) = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

Now, to find the equation of the circle that these points lie on, I can try to eliminate the parameter \( t \) from the equations for \( u \) and \( v \).

Let me set:

\( u = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (1)

\( v = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (2)

Let me solve equation (1) for \( t \):

From (1):

\( u (16 t^2 + 1) = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 + u = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 - 9 t + u = 0 \)

This is a quadratic equation in \( t \), but maybe it&#x27;s messy to solve for \( t \). Alternatively, let me express \( t \) from equation (1) in terms of \( u \), but it&#x27;s a quadratic, so maybe another approach.

Alternatively, notice that from equation (2), we can express \( 16 t^2 + 1 \) as denominator, so let me denote \( D = 16 t^2 + 1 \). Then:

\( u = 9 t / D \)

\( v = (4 t^2 - 2)/D \)

Then, let&#x27;s compute \( u^2 + v^2 \):

\( u^2 + v^2 = (81 t^2 + (4 t^2 - 2)^2) / D^2 \)

Compute numerator:

\( 81 t^2 + (16 t^4 - 16 t^2 + 4) = 16 t^4 + (81 t^2 - 16 t^2) + 4 = 16 t^4 + 65 t^2 + 4 \)

But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, express \( t \) in terms of \( u \) and substitute into \( v \).

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider that the image lies on a circle, so its equation can be written as \( (u - a)^2 + (v - b)^2 = r^2 \). We need to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( r \).

But since both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to the same circle, we might need to consider points from both images to determine the circle. Alternatively, maybe each axis maps to a circle, and both circles have the same radius? Wait, the problem states &quot;the circle&quot;, so perhaps both axes are mapped to the same circle. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the image of each axis is a circle, and we have to find the radius of each? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes,&quot; which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle, so their images coincide as a circle. Let me check with specific points.

First, check some points on the real axis and see where they are mapped.

Take z = 0 (on real axis): f(0) = (i*0 + 2)/(4*0 + i) = 2 / i = -2i.

Take z = ∞ (on extended real axis): The limit as t approaches ∞ of f(t) = (i t + 2)/(4 t + i) ≈ (i t)/(4 t) = i/4. So f(∞) = i/4.

Take z = 1: f(1) = (i + 2)/(4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 - i):

Numerator: (i + 2)(4 - i) = 4i - i^2 + 8 - 2i = (4i - 2i) + ( -i^2 +8 ) = 2i + 1 +8 = 2i +9

Denominator: (4 + i)(4 - i) = 16 - i^2 = 17

Thus, f(1) = (9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (9/17, 2/17)

Similarly, take z = -1: f(-1) = (-i + 2)/(-4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (-4 - i):

Numerator: (-i + 2)(-4 - i) = (-i)(-4) + (-i)(-i) + 2*(-4) + 2*(-i) = 4i + i^2 -8 -2i = (4i - 2i) + (-1 -8) = 2i -9

Denominator: (-4 + i)(-4 -i) = 16 - (i)^2 = 17

Thus, f(-1) = (-9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (-9/17, 2/17)

So these points are on the image of the real axis. Similarly, the points when z approaches 0 and ∞ are -2i and i/4. So plotting these points: -2i, i/4, (9/17, 2/17), (-9/17, 2/17). Hmm, these points seem to lie on a circle. Let&#x27;s check if they lie on the same circle.

First, let&#x27;s check if points -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17) lie on a circle.

A circle in the complex plane can be represented as |w - c| = r, where c is the center and r is the radius.

Let me consider three points: -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17).

First, represent these points in coordinates:

-2i is (0, -2)

i/4 is (0, 1/4)

(9/17, 2/17) is (9/17, 2/17)

So, three points: (0, -2), (0, 1/4), (9/17, 2/17)

We need to find the circle passing through these three points.

Let me denote the circle equation as \( (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Plugging in the three points:

1. For (0, -2):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (-2 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

2. For (0, 1/4):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (1/4 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

3. For (9/17, 2/17):

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

\( [a^2 + (b + 2)^2] - [a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( (b + 2)^2 - (b - 1/4)^2 = 0 \)

Expand both squares:

\( [b^2 +4b +4] - [b^2 - (1/2)b + 1/16] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( b^2 +4b +4 -b^2 + (1/2)b -1/16 = 0 \)

Combine like terms:

\( (4b + (1/2)b) + (4 - 1/16) = 0 \)

\( (9/2)b + (63/16) = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:

\( 72b + 63 = 0 \)

=&gt; 72b = -63 =&gt; b = -63/72 = -7/8

So, the y-coordinate of the center is -7/8.

Now, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 1:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 + 2 = -7/8 + 16/8 = 9/8

So,

\( a^2 + (9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Similarly, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 2:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 - 2/8 = -9/8

Thus,

\( a^2 + (-9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; same as above, so no new information.

Now, use equation 3 with b = -7/8:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - (-7/8))^2 = r^2 \)

First, compute 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16/136 + 119/136) = 135/136

So,

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = r^2 \)

We also have from equation 1: \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Set them equal:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Expand the left side:

\( (81/289 - (18/17)a + a^2) + (18225/18496) = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Simplify:

\( a^2 - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Cancel \( a^2 \):

\( - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = 81/64 \)

Multiply all terms by 18496 (which is 17^2 * 16^2) to eliminate denominators:

Let&#x27;s compute each term:

- (18/17)a * 18496 = -18 * 18496 /17 * a = -18*1088*a = -19584 a

81/289 *18496 = 81 * (18496 /289) = 81 * 64 = 5184

18225/18496 *18496 = 18225

81/64 *18496 = 81 * 18496 /64 = 81 * 289 = 23409

So the equation becomes:

-19584a + 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Compute 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Thus:

-19584a + 23409 = 23409

Subtract 23409:

-19584a = 0 =&gt; a = 0

Therefore, the center is at (0, -7/8) and radius squared is \( a^2 + 81/64 = 81/64 \), so radius is 9/8.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Wait, but let&#x27;s check if the point (9/17, 2/17) lies on this circle.

Center is (0, -7/8), radius 9/8.

Compute distance from (9/17, 2/17) to (0, -7/8):

Difference in x: 9/17 - 0 = 9/17

Difference in y: 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16 + 119)/136 = 135/136

Compute the distance squared:

(9/17)^2 + (135/136)^2

= 81/289 + 18225/18496

Convert to common denominator:

81/289 = (81 * 64)/ (289 * 64) = 5184/18496

18225/18496

Sum: 5184 + 18225 = 23409 /18496 = (153)^2 / (136)^2 = (153/136)^2

But 153 = 9*17, 136 = 8*17, so 153/136 = 9/8. Hence, distance squared is (9/8)^2, so distance is 9/8, which matches the radius. So, yes, the point is on the circle.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Now, let&#x27;s check the image of the imaginary axis. Earlier, we parametrized z = i s, so:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } \)

Let me simplify this expression.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s + 1)(-i) } \)

Wait, denominator: i*(4s +1)*(-i) = -i^2*(4s +1) = (1)*(4s +1) = 4s +1.

Numerator: (-s + 2)(-i) = (s - 2)i

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \)

So, written as \( u + iv \), this is:

\( u = 0 \), \( v = \frac{ s - 2 }{ 4s +1 } \)

Wait, hold on: Wait, if \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then the real part is 0 and the imaginary part is \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), right? Because multiplying by i gives a purely imaginary number.

Wait, but no: Let me check again. If we have \( \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then that&#x27;s equal to \( i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is a purely imaginary number. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points \( 0 + i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is the imaginary axis in the complex plane? But parametrized by s. Wait, but s is real, except when 4s +1 =0, i.e., s = -1/4, which would be a point at infinity.

But hold on, the image is a subset of the imaginary axis? But that can&#x27;t be, since the problem states that the transformation maps the axes to a circle. But according to this, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let&#x27;s recast the computation of f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis.

Given \( z = i s \), then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i} = \frac{ -s + 2 }{4i s + i } \)

Factor out i from the denominator:

\( \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } = \frac{ (-s + 2) }{i (4 s + 1)} \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1) } \)

Because denominator: \( i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1 \), so denominator becomes \( (4 s +1) \)

So, numerator is \( (s - 2)i \), so \( f(z) = \frac{(s - 2)i}{4 s +1 } \)

Therefore, this is a purely imaginary number scaled by \( \frac{(s - 2)}{4 s +1 } \). So the image is the imaginary axis? But parametrized with a real parameter s. Wait, but except when 4 s +1 =0, which would be s = -1/4, but as s approaches -1/4, the image goes to infinity.

But the imaginary axis is a line, not a circle. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. But since bilinear transformations map circles and lines to circles or lines, the image of the imaginary axis under this transformation is either a line or a circle. But according to this computation, it&#x27;s the imaginary axis, which is a line. But the problem states that it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So if the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line, then they can&#x27;t both be mapped to the same circle. But according to the problem statement, it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle onto which both axes are mapped. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my computation.

Wait, let&#x27;s re-examine the transformation. The transformation is \( f(z) = \frac{ i z + 2 }{4 z + i } \). Let me check if it&#x27;s invertible. The determinant of the coefficients matrix is (i)(i) - (2)(4) = (-1) - 8 = -9 ≠ 0, so it&#x27;s invertible.

Wait, when I computed the image of the imaginary axis, I substituted z = i s and found that f(z) is purely imaginary. But that would imply the image is the imaginary axis, but that contradicts the problem&#x27;s statement. Hmm. So perhaps my error is in the calculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s recompute the image of z = i s:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i } \)

Compute numerator: \( i^2 s + 2 = -s + 2 \)

Denominator: \( 4i s + i = i(4 s +1 ) \)

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i(4 s + 1) } \)

To express this in terms of real and imaginary parts, we can multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i(4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1 ) } \)

Since the denominator was multiplied by -i, which is the conjugate of i, to make it real.

Thus, the result is \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s +1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). So, as s varies over real numbers (excluding s = -1/4), the image is all purely imaginary numbers except when s approaches -1/4, which would approach infinity.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under f(z) is the imaginary axis in the w-plane, plus the point at infinity. But in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem states that both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to a circle. But according to the computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8 and center at (0, -7/8), while the imaginary axis is mapped to the imaginary line (which is a circle through infinity). Therefore, there must be an error here.

But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;. Maybe the problem is that in the finite plane, the image of the imaginary axis is a line, but perhaps when considering the extended complex plane, the line together with the point at infinity forms a circle. However, in that case, the radius would be infinite, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I have a miscalculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s check with specific points on the imaginary axis.

Take z = 0 (on imaginary axis? Wait, z=0 is on both axes, but in the parametrization z = i s, when s = 0, we get z=0. Then f(0) = 2/i = -2i, which is the same as before.

Take z = i (s=1): f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

Take z = 2i (s=2): f(2i) = (i*2i + 2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 + 2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) = 0.

Take z = i/2 (s=1/2): f(i/2) = (i*(i/2) +2)/(4*(i/2) +i) = (-1/2 + 2)/(2i +i) = (3/2)/(3i) = (3/2)/(3i) = 1/(2i) = -i/2.

Take z approaching infinity along the imaginary axis: s approaches infinity, so f(z) = ( -s + 2 ) / (4i s +i ) ≈ -s / 4i s = -1/(4i) = i/4.

So the images are: -2i, -i/5, 0, -i/2, and i/4. These points are all on the imaginary axis. So when s approaches infinity, f(z) approaches i/4, which is a finite point. When s approaches -1/4, the denominator 4s +1 approaches zero, so f(z) approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which in the extended complex plane is a circle. But in the standard complex plane, it&#x27;s a line. However, since Möbius transformations map lines to circles or lines, depending on whether they pass through the pole of the transformation.

But in our case, the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is not on the imaginary axis (since the imaginary axis is z = iy, and -i/4 is on the imaginary axis). Wait, z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis. Wait, the denominator 4z +i =0 when z = -i/4. Therefore, the point z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, and thus the transformation has a pole there. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation should be a circle, because the pole is on the original axis, so the image is a circle.

But according to the previous computation, the image seems to be the entire imaginary axis. But that contradicts. Wait, perhaps there&#x27;s a mistake here.

Wait, if the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is on the imaginary axis, then the image of the imaginary axis should be a circle in the extended complex plane. However, when we parameterized it, we obtained the entire imaginary axis except for the point at s = -1/4, which maps to infinity. Therefore, in the extended complex plane, the image is the imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which is a &quot;circle&quot; passing through infinity, i.e., a line. But according to Möbius transformation properties, if the original line passes through the pole, then the image is a line; otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle. Wait, maybe that&#x27;s the key.

Wait, the general property is that Möbius transformations map circles and lines to circles and lines. A line can be considered a circle passing through infinity. If the original line passes through the pole of the transformation (the point where the denominator is zero), then the image will pass through infinity, hence it&#x27;s a line. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle.

In our case, the real axis does not pass through the pole z = -i/4, since the pole is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle. The imaginary axis does pass through the pole z = -i/4, so its image is a line (the extended line, i.e., a circle passing through infinity).

But the problem states that the transformation maps both the real and imaginary axes onto the same circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Therefore, either the problem is ill-posed, or my computations are wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the image of each axis separately, and both images are circles, but with the same radius? Let me check again.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute the image of the imaginary axis again more carefully.

Parametrizing z = i s, then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (2 - s) }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(z) = \frac{ (2 - s)(-i) }{ (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ 4 s + 1 } \)

Thus, this is equal to \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s + 1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). Therefore, as s varies over ℝ \ { -1/4 }, the image is all imaginary numbers. However, when s approaches -1/4, the denominator approaches zero, so the image approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the extended imaginary axis (including infinity), which is a line in the extended complex plane. But the problem says it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle, which suggests a finite circle.

But according to my previous calculation, the image of the real axis is a circle with radius 9/8. However, the problem mentions &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle. But according to my computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misstated, or I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check another point on the imaginary axis. Take z = -i/4, which is the pole. But z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so it&#x27;s mapped to infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line plus infinity, which is a line in the extended plane. So that can&#x27;t be a circle. However, the problem says &quot;onto the circle&quot;, so maybe the question is actually only referring to the real axis? Or maybe the problem is in error.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation when considering the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s consider another approach. Let&#x27;s suppose that both images are circles. Wait, but we saw that the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line. However, maybe in the extended plane, the line is considered a circle, but the problem is asking for the radius in the standard plane, so only the real axis&#x27;s image is a circle with finite radius, and the imaginary axis&#x27;s image is a line, which has infinite radius. But the problem says &quot;the circle&quot;, so maybe the answer is 9/8, the radius from the real axis image.

But the problem states: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; If both axes are mapped to the same circle, but our calculation shows that the real axis is mapped to a circle and the imaginary axis to a line, there&#x27;s a problem. Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s try parametrizing the image of the imaginary axis again. Suppose I write w = f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis, so z = iy, y ∈ ℝ.

Then, w = (i*(iy) + 2)/(4*(iy) + i) = (-y + 2)/(4iy + i) = (2 - y)/(i(4y +1)).

Let me write w = u + iv.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

w = (2 - y)(-i)/(i(4y +1)(-i)) = (-i(2 - y))/( (4y +1) )

The denominator simplifies to (4y +1) because i*(-i) = 1.

Therefore, w = -i(2 - y)/(4y +1 ) = [ (y - 2)/(4y +1) ] i.

So, w is purely imaginary, with v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ), and u = 0.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ) for real y ≠ -1/4.

To see if this is a circle, we can parametrize v in terms of y:

Let me set t = y, then v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

This is a hyperbola or a straight line?

Wait, solving for t:

v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

Multiply both sides by (4t +1):

v(4t +1 ) = t -2

4v t + v = t -2

4v t - t = -2 - v

t(4v -1 ) = - (2 + v )

Therefore,

t = - (2 + v ) / (4v -1 )

This shows that for each v ≠ 1/4, there&#x27;s a corresponding t. But this parametrization covers all real numbers except v = 1/4, which would require the denominator 4v -1 =0, i.e., v=1/4. When v approaches 1/4, t approaches infinity.

But the image is the set of all points (0, v) where v can be any real number except v=1/4. Wait, but in reality, when t approaches infinity, v = (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t/(4t ) = 1/4. So, as t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4 from below. Similarly, when t approaches -1/4 from the right, denominator approaches zero, and v approaches ± infinity depending on the direction.

Wait, let&#x27;s analyze the function v(t) = (t -2)/(4t +1 )

Find the range of v(t):

As t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4.

As t approaches -1/4 from above, denominator approaches 0+, numerator approaches (-1/4 - 2 )= -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0+ = -infty.

As t approaches -1/4 from below, denominator approaches 0-, numerator approaches -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0- = +infty.

At t = 2, v=0.

Therefore, the function v(t) maps:

t ∈ (-∞, -1/4 ) to v ∈ (1/4, +infty ) (wait, hold on):

Wait, let&#x27;s check:

For t &lt; -1/4:

Denominator 4t +1 &lt; 0.

Numerator t -2: If t approaches -infty, t -2 approaches -infty.

So for t &lt; -1/4:

v = (negative)/(negative) = positive.

As t approaches -infty, v ≈ t /4t = 1/4. So from above.

Wait, as t approaches -infty, (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t /4t = 1/4, approaching 1/4 from above? Wait:

Let me compute the limit as t approaches -infty:

(t -2)/(4t +1 ) = [ t (1 - 2/t ) ] / [ t (4 + 1/t ) ] = (1 - 0)/(4 +0 ) = 1/4. So as t approaches -infty, v approaches 1/4 from above (since numerator is negative and denominator is negative, making positive, and when t approaches -infty, the difference from 1/4 is positive). Wait, not sure. Let me plug in t = -N where N is a large positive number:

v = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (N +2)/(4N -1 ) ≈ N /4N = 1/4. So approaching 1/4 from above? Let&#x27;s compute for large N:

(N +2)/(4N -1 ) = [N(1 + 2/N )]/[N(4 -1/N ) ] = (1 + 2/N )/(4 -1/N ) ≈ (1 +0 )/(4 -0 ) = 1/4. So as N increases, the value approaches 1/4 from slightly above? Let&#x27;s take N=1000:

(1000 +2 )/(4000 -1 ) = 1002/3999 ≈ 0.2506, which is slightly more than 1/4. So yes, approaches 1/4 from above.

Similarly, for t approaching -1/4 from the left (t approaching -1/4- ):

t approaching -1/4 from below (t = -1/4 - ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 - ε -2 ) = -9/4 - ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 - ε ) +1 = -1 -4ε +1 = -4ε

So v = (-9/4 - ε )/(-4ε ) = (9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (9/4)/4ε = 9/(16ε ), which approaches +infty as ε→0+.

For t approaching -1/4 from the right (t = -1/4 + ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 + ε -2 ) = -9/4 + ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 + ε ) +1 = -1 +4ε +1 = 4ε

v = (-9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (-9/4)/4ε = -9/(16ε ), which approaches -infty as ε→0+.

At t = 2: v=0.

Therefore, the range of v(t) is:

- When t ∈ (-infty, -1/4 ), v ∈ (1/4, +infty )

- When t ∈ (-1/4, ∞ ), v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 )

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 ) ∪ (1/4, +infty ), i.e., the entire imaginary axis except the point v=1/4. But in the extended complex plane, we include infinity, so the image is the entire imaginary axis (as a line), which makes sense because the pole at z=-i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so the image is a line.

But according to the problem statement, we should map both axes to a circle. This suggests a discrepancy. However, earlier computation showed that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I misinterpreted it. Maybe it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle that the real axis is mapped to, and separately the radius for the imaginary axis? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which seems to imply a single circle. But according to my calculations, they are mapped to different circles (one a finite circle, one a line). This is confusing.

Wait, maybe there&#x27;s a mistake in the computation for the image of the imaginary axis. Let me try a different approach. Instead of parametrizing z = i s, perhaps I should consider the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation f(z) and see if it can be represented as a circle.

The general method for finding the image of a line under a Möbius transformation is to take three points on the original line, find their images, and then determine the circle or line through those points.

Let&#x27;s apply this method to the imaginary axis.

Take three points on the imaginary axis:

1. z = 0: f(0) = 2/i = -2i.

2. z = i: f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

3. z = ∞: The transformation as z approaches ∞ along the imaginary axis: f(z) = (i*z + 2)/(4*z + i) ≈ (i*z)/(4*z) = i/4.

So the three image points are -2i, -i/5, and i/4.

These three points are on the imaginary axis. To determine if they lie on a circle, note that three colinear points (on the same line) lie on an infinite number of circles, but in the standard plane, the only circle that includes them is the line itself, considered as a circle with infinite radius. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line, which is a &quot;circle&quot; with infinite radius. But the problem asks for the radius of the circle, which is finite. Therefore, this suggests that only the real axis is mapped to a circle with finite radius, and the answer should be 9/8.

However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the circle, which contradicts our findings. Therefore, perhaps there&#x27;s an error in the problem or in my solution.

Wait, let&#x27;s cross-verify the image of the real axis. We found that it&#x27;s a circle with center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. Let me check if the images of the real axis include points from the imaginary axis&#x27;s image. For example, take z =0 (on both axes), maps to -2i, which is on the circle (distance from center (0, -7/8) to -2i (0, -2) is | -2 - (-7/8)| = |-16/8 +7/8| = |-9/8| = 9/8, which is the radius. So yes, -2i is on the circle. The point at infinity maps to i/4, which is also on the circle: center (0, -7/8), distance to i/4 (0, 1/4) is |1/4 - (-7/8)| = |1/4 +7/8| = |9/8| =9/8, which is the radius. The images of the real axis include points like i/4 and -2i, which are also images of points on the imaginary axis. Wait, hold on. The image of the real axis includes the point -2i (image of z=0) and i/4 (image of z=∞), which are also images of points on the imaginary axis (z=0 and z=∞). Similarly, images of the imaginary axis include -2i, which is also on the real axis&#x27;s image. Wait, but the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, but the circle we found for the real axis&#x27;s image includes some points on the imaginary axis. Specifically, the circle intersects the imaginary axis at -2i and i/4. But the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, which includes these two points. Therefore, perhaps the problem is referring to the circle that is the image of the real axis, and the image of the imaginary axis is the line that coincides with the imaginary axis, intersecting the circle at -2i and i/4. However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the same circle. Since the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line intersecting that circle at two points, but not the entire circle. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my previous reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary line. Let me check with another point.

Take z = 2i (s=2). Then f(2i) = (i*2i +2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 +2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) =0, which is on the real axis&#x27;s image circle? Let&#x27;s check. The circle has center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. The point 0 is at (0,0). The distance from (0,0) to (0, -7/8) is 7/8, which is less than 9/8, so 0 is inside the circle. Wait, but 0 is the image of z=2i, which is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, 0 is inside the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis includes points inside the circle. But the image of the real axis is the circle itself. So the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary axis, which intersects the circle at -2i and i/4, and passes through 0 inside the circle. Therefore, the two images are different: one is a circle, the other is a line intersecting the circle. So the problem statement must be incorrect, or I have a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem is to find the radius of the circle that both axes are mapped to, implying that both images coincide. In that case, my previous calculation must be wrong.

Wait, let&#x27;s see. The transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let me check if it&#x27;s an involution or has some symmetry. Let me compute f(f(z)):

Compute f(f(z)):

First, f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let&#x27;s substitute w = f(z):

f(w) = (i w +2 )/(4 w +i )

Substitute w = (i z +2)/(4 z +i ):

= [ i*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +2 ] / [4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ]

Simplify numerator:

[ (i^2 z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2 ] = [ (-z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2*(4 z +i )/(4 z +i ) ]

= [ (-z + 2i +8 z +2i )/(4 z +i ) ] = [7 z +4i )/(4 z +i )

Denominator:

[4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ] = [4i z +8 +i*(4 z +i ) ]/(4 z +i )

= [4i z +8 +4i z +i^2 ]/(4 z +i )

= [8i z +8 -1 ]/(4 z +i )

= (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i )

Therefore, f(f(z)) = [ (7 z +4i )/(4 z +i ) ] / [ (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i ) ] = (7 z +4i )/(8i z +7 )

This is not equal to z, so f is not an involution. Therefore, there&#x27;s no immediate symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation maps both axes to the same circle due to some symmetry. But my previous computations do not support this. The real axis maps to a circle, and the imaginary axis maps to a line. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in my solution.

Alternatively, maybe the question is to find the radius for each axis separately. For the real axis, we have radius 9/8. For the imaginary axis, since it&#x27;s mapped to a line, which can be thought of as a circle with infinite radius, but the problem asks for a finite radius. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 9/8.

Given the problem&#x27;s wording, and since the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line (infinite radius), but the problem mentions &quot;the circle&quot;, likely referring to the real axis&#x27;s image, which is a finite circle, the answer should be 9/8.

But to confirm, let&#x27;s see if any other references or methods can show that both images are the same circle.

Alternatively, suppose we consider the transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i )

Let me check if it maps the real axis to a circle and the imaginary axis to the same circle.

From previous calculations, the real axis maps to a circle with center (0, -7/8 ) and radius 9/8. The imaginary axis maps to the imaginary line, which intersects this circle at -2i and i/4. The points -2i and i/4 are both on the circle, as:

Distance from -2i (0, -2) to center (0, -7/8 ) is | -2 - (-7/8 ) | = |-9/8 | =9/8.

Distance from i/4 (0, 1/4 ) to center (0, -7/8 ) is |1/4 - (-7/8 ) | = |9/8 | =9/8.

But the rest of the imaginary axis is not on the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis is the line passing through -2i and i/4 and extending to infinity, which is the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is not the same as the image of the real axis, unless we consider the extended line as a circle, which has infinite radius.

Given that the problem asks for the radius of the circle, expecting a finite number, and given that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, I think the answer is 9/8.

Therefore, the radius is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the circle is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes, we analyze the images of these axes under the transformation.

### Image of the Real Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \) where \( t \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = t \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i}
   \]
3. **Separating Real and Imaginary Parts**:
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
   This gives the parametric equations:
   \[
   u(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1}, \quad v(t) = \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
4. **Finding the Circle**:
   - By eliminating the parameter \( t \), we find that the image lies on a circle.
   - The circle&#x27;s center is found to be \( (0, -\frac{7}{8}) \) and the radius is calculated as \( \frac{9}{8} \).

### Image of the Imaginary Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = is \) where \( s \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = is \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(is) = \frac{-s + 2}{i(4s + 1)}
   \]
3. **Simplifying**:
   - This results in purely imaginary numbers, indicating the image is a line (the imaginary axis in the complex plane).

### Conclusion
The real axis is mapped to a circle with radius \( \frac{9}{8} \). The imaginary axis is mapped to a line, which in the extended complex plane can be considered a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem specifies a finite radius, so we conclude the radius of the circle onto which the real axis is mapped is the answer.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of the circle that the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes onto. Hmm, bilinear transformations, also known as Möbius transformations, right? They have some properties like mapping circles and lines to circles or lines. Since both the real and imaginary axes are lines in the complex plane, their images under this transformation should be either circles or lines. The problem says &quot;onto the circle,&quot; so I guess both axes are mapped to the same circle? Or maybe each axis is mapped to a circle, and we need to find their radii? Wait, the question says &quot;the circle,&quot; so maybe both are mapped to the same circle? Let me check the wording again: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So, both axes are mapped to the same circle, and we need to find its radius. Alright, that makes sense.

First, let me recall that a bilinear transformation is determined by its action on three points. Also, since it&#x27;s a transformation from the extended complex plane to itself, it can map lines to circles and vice versa. The real and imaginary axes are both lines through the origin, but perpendicular to each other. The transformation \( f(z) \) is given, so maybe I can find images of points on the real axis and the imaginary axis and see what circle they lie on.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the real axis and the imaginary axis, plug them into the transformation, and then find the equation of the image curve, which should be a circle, and then find its radius.

Let me try this approach.

First, let&#x27;s handle the real axis. The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \), where \( t \) is a real number. Then, substitute \( z = t \) into the transformation:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \).

Similarly, the imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = i s \), where \( s \) is a real number. Substituting \( z = i s \):

\( f(i s) = \frac{i (i s) + 2}{4 (i s) + i} = \frac{-s + 2}{4 i s + i} = \frac{(-s + 2)}{i (4 s + 1)} \).

Let me compute both images and see if they lie on the same circle.

Starting with the real axis:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \). Let me write this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let me denote \( f(t) = u + iv \).

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize:

Denominator: \( 4 t + i \), conjugate is \( 4 t - i \).

So,

\( f(t) = \frac{(i t + 2)(4 t - i)}{(4 t + i)(4 t - i)} \).

Compute the denominator first:

\( (4 t)^2 - (i)^2 = 16 t^2 - (-1) = 16 t^2 + 1 \).

Numerator:

Expand \( (i t + 2)(4 t - i) \):

First term: \( i t \cdot 4 t = 4 i t^2 \)

Second term: \( i t \cdot (-i) = -i^2 t = -(-1) t = t \)

Third term: \( 2 \cdot 4 t = 8 t \)

Fourth term: \( 2 \cdot (-i) = -2 i \)

So combining all terms:

\( 4 i t^2 + t + 8 t - 2 i = 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \).

Therefore, the numerator is \( 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \), and the denominator is \( 16 t^2 + 1 \).

So, separating into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( 9 t / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Imaginary part: \( (4 t^2 - 2) / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Therefore, \( f(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \).

So, parametrizing the image of the real axis as \( (u(t), v(t)) \), where:

\( u(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

\( v(t) = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

Now, to find the equation of the circle that these points lie on, I can try to eliminate the parameter \( t \) from the equations for \( u \) and \( v \).

Let me set:

\( u = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (1)

\( v = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (2)

Let me solve equation (1) for \( t \):

From (1):

\( u (16 t^2 + 1) = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 + u = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 - 9 t + u = 0 \)

This is a quadratic equation in \( t \), but maybe it&#x27;s messy to solve for \( t \). Alternatively, let me express \( t \) from equation (1) in terms of \( u \), but it&#x27;s a quadratic, so maybe another approach.

Alternatively, notice that from equation (2), we can express \( 16 t^2 + 1 \) as denominator, so let me denote \( D = 16 t^2 + 1 \). Then:

\( u = 9 t / D \)

\( v = (4 t^2 - 2)/D \)

Then, let&#x27;s compute \( u^2 + v^2 \):

\( u^2 + v^2 = (81 t^2 + (4 t^2 - 2)^2) / D^2 \)

Compute numerator:

\( 81 t^2 + (16 t^4 - 16 t^2 + 4) = 16 t^4 + (81 t^2 - 16 t^2) + 4 = 16 t^4 + 65 t^2 + 4 \)

But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, express \( t \) in terms of \( u \) and substitute into \( v \).

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider that the image lies on a circle, so its equation can be written as \( (u - a)^2 + (v - b)^2 = r^2 \). We need to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( r \).

But since both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to the same circle, we might need to consider points from both images to determine the circle. Alternatively, maybe each axis maps to a circle, and both circles have the same radius? Wait, the problem states &quot;the circle&quot;, so perhaps both axes are mapped to the same circle. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the image of each axis is a circle, and we have to find the radius of each? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes,&quot; which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle, so their images coincide as a circle. Let me check with specific points.

First, check some points on the real axis and see where they are mapped.

Take z = 0 (on real axis): f(0) = (i*0 + 2)/(4*0 + i) = 2 / i = -2i.

Take z = ∞ (on extended real axis): The limit as t approaches ∞ of f(t) = (i t + 2)/(4 t + i) ≈ (i t)/(4 t) = i/4. So f(∞) = i/4.

Take z = 1: f(1) = (i + 2)/(4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 - i):

Numerator: (i + 2)(4 - i) = 4i - i^2 + 8 - 2i = (4i - 2i) + ( -i^2 +8 ) = 2i + 1 +8 = 2i +9

Denominator: (4 + i)(4 - i) = 16 - i^2 = 17

Thus, f(1) = (9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (9/17, 2/17)

Similarly, take z = -1: f(-1) = (-i + 2)/(-4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (-4 - i):

Numerator: (-i + 2)(-4 - i) = (-i)(-4) + (-i)(-i) + 2*(-4) + 2*(-i) = 4i + i^2 -8 -2i = (4i - 2i) + (-1 -8) = 2i -9

Denominator: (-4 + i)(-4 -i) = 16 - (i)^2 = 17

Thus, f(-1) = (-9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (-9/17, 2/17)

So these points are on the image of the real axis. Similarly, the points when z approaches 0 and ∞ are -2i and i/4. So plotting these points: -2i, i/4, (9/17, 2/17), (-9/17, 2/17). Hmm, these points seem to lie on a circle. Let&#x27;s check if they lie on the same circle.

First, let&#x27;s check if points -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17) lie on a circle.

A circle in the complex plane can be represented as |w - c| = r, where c is the center and r is the radius.

Let me consider three points: -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17).

First, represent these points in coordinates:

-2i is (0, -2)

i/4 is (0, 1/4)

(9/17, 2/17) is (9/17, 2/17)

So, three points: (0, -2), (0, 1/4), (9/17, 2/17)

We need to find the circle passing through these three points.

Let me denote the circle equation as \( (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Plugging in the three points:

1. For (0, -2):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (-2 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

2. For (0, 1/4):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (1/4 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

3. For (9/17, 2/17):

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

\( [a^2 + (b + 2)^2] - [a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( (b + 2)^2 - (b - 1/4)^2 = 0 \)

Expand both squares:

\( [b^2 +4b +4] - [b^2 - (1/2)b + 1/16] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( b^2 +4b +4 -b^2 + (1/2)b -1/16 = 0 \)

Combine like terms:

\( (4b + (1/2)b) + (4 - 1/16) = 0 \)

\( (9/2)b + (63/16) = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:

\( 72b + 63 = 0 \)

=&gt; 72b = -63 =&gt; b = -63/72 = -7/8

So, the y-coordinate of the center is -7/8.

Now, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 1:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 + 2 = -7/8 + 16/8 = 9/8

So,

\( a^2 + (9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Similarly, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 2:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 - 2/8 = -9/8

Thus,

\( a^2 + (-9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; same as above, so no new information.

Now, use equation 3 with b = -7/8:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - (-7/8))^2 = r^2 \)

First, compute 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16/136 + 119/136) = 135/136

So,

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = r^2 \)

We also have from equation 1: \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Set them equal:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Expand the left side:

\( (81/289 - (18/17)a + a^2) + (18225/18496) = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Simplify:

\( a^2 - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Cancel \( a^2 \):

\( - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = 81/64 \)

Multiply all terms by 18496 (which is 17^2 * 16^2) to eliminate denominators:

Let&#x27;s compute each term:

- (18/17)a * 18496 = -18 * 18496 /17 * a = -18*1088*a = -19584 a

81/289 *18496 = 81 * (18496 /289) = 81 * 64 = 5184

18225/18496 *18496 = 18225

81/64 *18496 = 81 * 18496 /64 = 81 * 289 = 23409

So the equation becomes:

-19584a + 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Compute 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Thus:

-19584a + 23409 = 23409

Subtract 23409:

-19584a = 0 =&gt; a = 0

Therefore, the center is at (0, -7/8) and radius squared is \( a^2 + 81/64 = 81/64 \), so radius is 9/8.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Wait, but let&#x27;s check if the point (9/17, 2/17) lies on this circle.

Center is (0, -7/8), radius 9/8.

Compute distance from (9/17, 2/17) to (0, -7/8):

Difference in x: 9/17 - 0 = 9/17

Difference in y: 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16 + 119)/136 = 135/136

Compute the distance squared:

(9/17)^2 + (135/136)^2

= 81/289 + 18225/18496

Convert to common denominator:

81/289 = (81 * 64)/ (289 * 64) = 5184/18496

18225/18496

Sum: 5184 + 18225 = 23409 /18496 = (153)^2 / (136)^2 = (153/136)^2

But 153 = 9*17, 136 = 8*17, so 153/136 = 9/8. Hence, distance squared is (9/8)^2, so distance is 9/8, which matches the radius. So, yes, the point is on the circle.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Now, let&#x27;s check the image of the imaginary axis. Earlier, we parametrized z = i s, so:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } \)

Let me simplify this expression.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s + 1)(-i) } \)

Wait, denominator: i*(4s +1)*(-i) = -i^2*(4s +1) = (1)*(4s +1) = 4s +1.

Numerator: (-s + 2)(-i) = (s - 2)i

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \)

So, written as \( u + iv \), this is:

\( u = 0 \), \( v = \frac{ s - 2 }{ 4s +1 } \)

Wait, hold on: Wait, if \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then the real part is 0 and the imaginary part is \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), right? Because multiplying by i gives a purely imaginary number.

Wait, but no: Let me check again. If we have \( \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then that&#x27;s equal to \( i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is a purely imaginary number. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points \( 0 + i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is the imaginary axis in the complex plane? But parametrized by s. Wait, but s is real, except when 4s +1 =0, i.e., s = -1/4, which would be a point at infinity.

But hold on, the image is a subset of the imaginary axis? But that can&#x27;t be, since the problem states that the transformation maps the axes to a circle. But according to this, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let&#x27;s recast the computation of f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis.

Given \( z = i s \), then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i} = \frac{ -s + 2 }{4i s + i } \)

Factor out i from the denominator:

\( \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } = \frac{ (-s + 2) }{i (4 s + 1)} \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1) } \)

Because denominator: \( i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1 \), so denominator becomes \( (4 s +1) \)

So, numerator is \( (s - 2)i \), so \( f(z) = \frac{(s - 2)i}{4 s +1 } \)

Therefore, this is a purely imaginary number scaled by \( \frac{(s - 2)}{4 s +1 } \). So the image is the imaginary axis? But parametrized with a real parameter s. Wait, but except when 4 s +1 =0, which would be s = -1/4, but as s approaches -1/4, the image goes to infinity.

But the imaginary axis is a line, not a circle. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. But since bilinear transformations map circles and lines to circles or lines, the image of the imaginary axis under this transformation is either a line or a circle. But according to this computation, it&#x27;s the imaginary axis, which is a line. But the problem states that it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So if the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line, then they can&#x27;t both be mapped to the same circle. But according to the problem statement, it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle onto which both axes are mapped. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my computation.

Wait, let&#x27;s re-examine the transformation. The transformation is \( f(z) = \frac{ i z + 2 }{4 z + i } \). Let me check if it&#x27;s invertible. The determinant of the coefficients matrix is (i)(i) - (2)(4) = (-1) - 8 = -9 ≠ 0, so it&#x27;s invertible.

Wait, when I computed the image of the imaginary axis, I substituted z = i s and found that f(z) is purely imaginary. But that would imply the image is the imaginary axis, but that contradicts the problem&#x27;s statement. Hmm. So perhaps my error is in the calculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s recompute the image of z = i s:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i } \)

Compute numerator: \( i^2 s + 2 = -s + 2 \)

Denominator: \( 4i s + i = i(4 s +1 ) \)

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i(4 s + 1) } \)

To express this in terms of real and imaginary parts, we can multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i(4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1 ) } \)

Since the denominator was multiplied by -i, which is the conjugate of i, to make it real.

Thus, the result is \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s +1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). So, as s varies over real numbers (excluding s = -1/4), the image is all purely imaginary numbers except when s approaches -1/4, which would approach infinity.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under f(z) is the imaginary axis in the w-plane, plus the point at infinity. But in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem states that both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to a circle. But according to the computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8 and center at (0, -7/8), while the imaginary axis is mapped to the imaginary line (which is a circle through infinity). Therefore, there must be an error here.

But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;. Maybe the problem is that in the finite plane, the image of the imaginary axis is a line, but perhaps when considering the extended complex plane, the line together with the point at infinity forms a circle. However, in that case, the radius would be infinite, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I have a miscalculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s check with specific points on the imaginary axis.

Take z = 0 (on imaginary axis? Wait, z=0 is on both axes, but in the parametrization z = i s, when s = 0, we get z=0. Then f(0) = 2/i = -2i, which is the same as before.

Take z = i (s=1): f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

Take z = 2i (s=2): f(2i) = (i*2i + 2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 + 2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) = 0.

Take z = i/2 (s=1/2): f(i/2) = (i*(i/2) +2)/(4*(i/2) +i) = (-1/2 + 2)/(2i +i) = (3/2)/(3i) = (3/2)/(3i) = 1/(2i) = -i/2.

Take z approaching infinity along the imaginary axis: s approaches infinity, so f(z) = ( -s + 2 ) / (4i s +i ) ≈ -s / 4i s = -1/(4i) = i/4.

So the images are: -2i, -i/5, 0, -i/2, and i/4. These points are all on the imaginary axis. So when s approaches infinity, f(z) approaches i/4, which is a finite point. When s approaches -1/4, the denominator 4s +1 approaches zero, so f(z) approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which in the extended complex plane is a circle. But in the standard complex plane, it&#x27;s a line. However, since Möbius transformations map lines to circles or lines, depending on whether they pass through the pole of the transformation.

But in our case, the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is not on the imaginary axis (since the imaginary axis is z = iy, and -i/4 is on the imaginary axis). Wait, z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis. Wait, the denominator 4z +i =0 when z = -i/4. Therefore, the point z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, and thus the transformation has a pole there. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation should be a circle, because the pole is on the original axis, so the image is a circle.

But according to the previous computation, the image seems to be the entire imaginary axis. But that contradicts. Wait, perhaps there&#x27;s a mistake here.

Wait, if the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is on the imaginary axis, then the image of the imaginary axis should be a circle in the extended complex plane. However, when we parameterized it, we obtained the entire imaginary axis except for the point at s = -1/4, which maps to infinity. Therefore, in the extended complex plane, the image is the imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which is a &quot;circle&quot; passing through infinity, i.e., a line. But according to Möbius transformation properties, if the original line passes through the pole, then the image is a line; otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle. Wait, maybe that&#x27;s the key.

Wait, the general property is that Möbius transformations map circles and lines to circles and lines. A line can be considered a circle passing through infinity. If the original line passes through the pole of the transformation (the point where the denominator is zero), then the image will pass through infinity, hence it&#x27;s a line. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle.

In our case, the real axis does not pass through the pole z = -i/4, since the pole is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle. The imaginary axis does pass through the pole z = -i/4, so its image is a line (the extended line, i.e., a circle passing through infinity).

But the problem states that the transformation maps both the real and imaginary axes onto the same circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Therefore, either the problem is ill-posed, or my computations are wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the image of each axis separately, and both images are circles, but with the same radius? Let me check again.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute the image of the imaginary axis again more carefully.

Parametrizing z = i s, then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (2 - s) }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(z) = \frac{ (2 - s)(-i) }{ (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ 4 s + 1 } \)

Thus, this is equal to \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s + 1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). Therefore, as s varies over ℝ \ { -1/4 }, the image is all imaginary numbers. However, when s approaches -1/4, the denominator approaches zero, so the image approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the extended imaginary axis (including infinity), which is a line in the extended complex plane. But the problem says it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle, which suggests a finite circle.

But according to my previous calculation, the image of the real axis is a circle with radius 9/8. However, the problem mentions &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle. But according to my computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misstated, or I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check another point on the imaginary axis. Take z = -i/4, which is the pole. But z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so it&#x27;s mapped to infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line plus infinity, which is a line in the extended plane. So that can&#x27;t be a circle. However, the problem says &quot;onto the circle&quot;, so maybe the question is actually only referring to the real axis? Or maybe the problem is in error.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation when considering the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s consider another approach. Let&#x27;s suppose that both images are circles. Wait, but we saw that the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line. However, maybe in the extended plane, the line is considered a circle, but the problem is asking for the radius in the standard plane, so only the real axis&#x27;s image is a circle with finite radius, and the imaginary axis&#x27;s image is a line, which has infinite radius. But the problem says &quot;the circle&quot;, so maybe the answer is 9/8, the radius from the real axis image.

But the problem states: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; If both axes are mapped to the same circle, but our calculation shows that the real axis is mapped to a circle and the imaginary axis to a line, there&#x27;s a problem. Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s try parametrizing the image of the imaginary axis again. Suppose I write w = f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis, so z = iy, y ∈ ℝ.

Then, w = (i*(iy) + 2)/(4*(iy) + i) = (-y + 2)/(4iy + i) = (2 - y)/(i(4y +1)).

Let me write w = u + iv.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

w = (2 - y)(-i)/(i(4y +1)(-i)) = (-i(2 - y))/( (4y +1) )

The denominator simplifies to (4y +1) because i*(-i) = 1.

Therefore, w = -i(2 - y)/(4y +1 ) = [ (y - 2)/(4y +1) ] i.

So, w is purely imaginary, with v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ), and u = 0.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ) for real y ≠ -1/4.

To see if this is a circle, we can parametrize v in terms of y:

Let me set t = y, then v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

This is a hyperbola or a straight line?

Wait, solving for t:

v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

Multiply both sides by (4t +1):

v(4t +1 ) = t -2

4v t + v = t -2

4v t - t = -2 - v

t(4v -1 ) = - (2 + v )

Therefore,

t = - (2 + v ) / (4v -1 )

This shows that for each v ≠ 1/4, there&#x27;s a corresponding t. But this parametrization covers all real numbers except v = 1/4, which would require the denominator 4v -1 =0, i.e., v=1/4. When v approaches 1/4, t approaches infinity.

But the image is the set of all points (0, v) where v can be any real number except v=1/4. Wait, but in reality, when t approaches infinity, v = (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t/(4t ) = 1/4. So, as t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4 from below. Similarly, when t approaches -1/4 from the right, denominator approaches zero, and v approaches ± infinity depending on the direction.

Wait, let&#x27;s analyze the function v(t) = (t -2)/(4t +1 )

Find the range of v(t):

As t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4.

As t approaches -1/4 from above, denominator approaches 0+, numerator approaches (-1/4 - 2 )= -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0+ = -infty.

As t approaches -1/4 from below, denominator approaches 0-, numerator approaches -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0- = +infty.

At t = 2, v=0.

Therefore, the function v(t) maps:

t ∈ (-∞, -1/4 ) to v ∈ (1/4, +infty ) (wait, hold on):

Wait, let&#x27;s check:

For t &lt; -1/4:

Denominator 4t +1 &lt; 0.

Numerator t -2: If t approaches -infty, t -2 approaches -infty.

So for t &lt; -1/4:

v = (negative)/(negative) = positive.

As t approaches -infty, v ≈ t /4t = 1/4. So from above.

Wait, as t approaches -infty, (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t /4t = 1/4, approaching 1/4 from above? Wait:

Let me compute the limit as t approaches -infty:

(t -2)/(4t +1 ) = [ t (1 - 2/t ) ] / [ t (4 + 1/t ) ] = (1 - 0)/(4 +0 ) = 1/4. So as t approaches -infty, v approaches 1/4 from above (since numerator is negative and denominator is negative, making positive, and when t approaches -infty, the difference from 1/4 is positive). Wait, not sure. Let me plug in t = -N where N is a large positive number:

v = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (N +2)/(4N -1 ) ≈ N /4N = 1/4. So approaching 1/4 from above? Let&#x27;s compute for large N:

(N +2)/(4N -1 ) = [N(1 + 2/N )]/[N(4 -1/N ) ] = (1 + 2/N )/(4 -1/N ) ≈ (1 +0 )/(4 -0 ) = 1/4. So as N increases, the value approaches 1/4 from slightly above? Let&#x27;s take N=1000:

(1000 +2 )/(4000 -1 ) = 1002/3999 ≈ 0.2506, which is slightly more than 1/4. So yes, approaches 1/4 from above.

Similarly, for t approaching -1/4 from the left (t approaching -1/4- ):

t approaching -1/4 from below (t = -1/4 - ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 - ε -2 ) = -9/4 - ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 - ε ) +1 = -1 -4ε +1 = -4ε

So v = (-9/4 - ε )/(-4ε ) = (9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (9/4)/4ε = 9/(16ε ), which approaches +infty as ε→0+.

For t approaching -1/4 from the right (t = -1/4 + ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 + ε -2 ) = -9/4 + ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 + ε ) +1 = -1 +4ε +1 = 4ε

v = (-9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (-9/4)/4ε = -9/(16ε ), which approaches -infty as ε→0+.

At t = 2: v=0.

Therefore, the range of v(t) is:

- When t ∈ (-infty, -1/4 ), v ∈ (1/4, +infty )

- When t ∈ (-1/4, ∞ ), v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 )

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 ) ∪ (1/4, +infty ), i.e., the entire imaginary axis except the point v=1/4. But in the extended complex plane, we include infinity, so the image is the entire imaginary axis (as a line), which makes sense because the pole at z=-i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so the image is a line.

But according to the problem statement, we should map both axes to a circle. This suggests a discrepancy. However, earlier computation showed that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I misinterpreted it. Maybe it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle that the real axis is mapped to, and separately the radius for the imaginary axis? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which seems to imply a single circle. But according to my calculations, they are mapped to different circles (one a finite circle, one a line). This is confusing.

Wait, maybe there&#x27;s a mistake in the computation for the image of the imaginary axis. Let me try a different approach. Instead of parametrizing z = i s, perhaps I should consider the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation f(z) and see if it can be represented as a circle.

The general method for finding the image of a line under a Möbius transformation is to take three points on the original line, find their images, and then determine the circle or line through those points.

Let&#x27;s apply this method to the imaginary axis.

Take three points on the imaginary axis:

1. z = 0: f(0) = 2/i = -2i.

2. z = i: f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

3. z = ∞: The transformation as z approaches ∞ along the imaginary axis: f(z) = (i*z + 2)/(4*z + i) ≈ (i*z)/(4*z) = i/4.

So the three image points are -2i, -i/5, and i/4.

These three points are on the imaginary axis. To determine if they lie on a circle, note that three colinear points (on the same line) lie on an infinite number of circles, but in the standard plane, the only circle that includes them is the line itself, considered as a circle with infinite radius. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line, which is a &quot;circle&quot; with infinite radius. But the problem asks for the radius of the circle, which is finite. Therefore, this suggests that only the real axis is mapped to a circle with finite radius, and the answer should be 9/8.

However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the circle, which contradicts our findings. Therefore, perhaps there&#x27;s an error in the problem or in my solution.

Wait, let&#x27;s cross-verify the image of the real axis. We found that it&#x27;s a circle with center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. Let me check if the images of the real axis include points from the imaginary axis&#x27;s image. For example, take z =0 (on both axes), maps to -2i, which is on the circle (distance from center (0, -7/8) to -2i (0, -2) is | -2 - (-7/8)| = |-16/8 +7/8| = |-9/8| = 9/8, which is the radius. So yes, -2i is on the circle. The point at infinity maps to i/4, which is also on the circle: center (0, -7/8), distance to i/4 (0, 1/4) is |1/4 - (-7/8)| = |1/4 +7/8| = |9/8| =9/8, which is the radius. The images of the real axis include points like i/4 and -2i, which are also images of points on the imaginary axis. Wait, hold on. The image of the real axis includes the point -2i (image of z=0) and i/4 (image of z=∞), which are also images of points on the imaginary axis (z=0 and z=∞). Similarly, images of the imaginary axis include -2i, which is also on the real axis&#x27;s image. Wait, but the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, but the circle we found for the real axis&#x27;s image includes some points on the imaginary axis. Specifically, the circle intersects the imaginary axis at -2i and i/4. But the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, which includes these two points. Therefore, perhaps the problem is referring to the circle that is the image of the real axis, and the image of the imaginary axis is the line that coincides with the imaginary axis, intersecting the circle at -2i and i/4. However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the same circle. Since the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line intersecting that circle at two points, but not the entire circle. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my previous reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary line. Let me check with another point.

Take z = 2i (s=2). Then f(2i) = (i*2i +2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 +2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) =0, which is on the real axis&#x27;s image circle? Let&#x27;s check. The circle has center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. The point 0 is at (0,0). The distance from (0,0) to (0, -7/8) is 7/8, which is less than 9/8, so 0 is inside the circle. Wait, but 0 is the image of z=2i, which is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, 0 is inside the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis includes points inside the circle. But the image of the real axis is the circle itself. So the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary axis, which intersects the circle at -2i and i/4, and passes through 0 inside the circle. Therefore, the two images are different: one is a circle, the other is a line intersecting the circle. So the problem statement must be incorrect, or I have a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem is to find the radius of the circle that both axes are mapped to, implying that both images coincide. In that case, my previous calculation must be wrong.

Wait, let&#x27;s see. The transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let me check if it&#x27;s an involution or has some symmetry. Let me compute f(f(z)):

Compute f(f(z)):

First, f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let&#x27;s substitute w = f(z):

f(w) = (i w +2 )/(4 w +i )

Substitute w = (i z +2)/(4 z +i ):

= [ i*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +2 ] / [4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ]

Simplify numerator:

[ (i^2 z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2 ] = [ (-z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2*(4 z +i )/(4 z +i ) ]

= [ (-z + 2i +8 z +2i )/(4 z +i ) ] = [7 z +4i )/(4 z +i )

Denominator:

[4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ] = [4i z +8 +i*(4 z +i ) ]/(4 z +i )

= [4i z +8 +4i z +i^2 ]/(4 z +i )

= [8i z +8 -1 ]/(4 z +i )

= (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i )

Therefore, f(f(z)) = [ (7 z +4i )/(4 z +i ) ] / [ (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i ) ] = (7 z +4i )/(8i z +7 )

This is not equal to z, so f is not an involution. Therefore, there&#x27;s no immediate symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation maps both axes to the same circle due to some symmetry. But my previous computations do not support this. The real axis maps to a circle, and the imaginary axis maps to a line. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in my solution.

Alternatively, maybe the question is to find the radius for each axis separately. For the real axis, we have radius 9/8. For the imaginary axis, since it&#x27;s mapped to a line, which can be thought of as a circle with infinite radius, but the problem asks for a finite radius. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 9/8.

Given the problem&#x27;s wording, and since the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line (infinite radius), but the problem mentions &quot;the circle&quot;, likely referring to the real axis&#x27;s image, which is a finite circle, the answer should be 9/8.

But to confirm, let&#x27;s see if any other references or methods can show that both images are the same circle.

Alternatively, suppose we consider the transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i )

Let me check if it maps the real axis to a circle and the imaginary axis to the same circle.

From previous calculations, the real axis maps to a circle with center (0, -7/8 ) and radius 9/8. The imaginary axis maps to the imaginary line, which intersects this circle at -2i and i/4. The points -2i and i/4 are both on the circle, as:

Distance from -2i (0, -2) to center (0, -7/8 ) is | -2 - (-7/8 ) | = |-9/8 | =9/8.

Distance from i/4 (0, 1/4 ) to center (0, -7/8 ) is |1/4 - (-7/8 ) | = |9/8 | =9/8.

But the rest of the imaginary axis is not on the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis is the line passing through -2i and i/4 and extending to infinity, which is the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is not the same as the image of the real axis, unless we consider the extended line as a circle, which has infinite radius.

Given that the problem asks for the radius of the circle, expecting a finite number, and given that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, I think the answer is 9/8.

Therefore, the radius is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the circle is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes, we analyze the images of these axes under the transformation.

### Image of the Real Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \) where \( t \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = t \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i}
   \]
3. **Separating Real and Imaginary Parts**:
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
   This gives the parametric equations:
   \[
   u(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1}, \quad v(t) = \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
4. **Finding the Circle**:
   - By eliminating the parameter \( t \), we find that the image lies on a circle.
   - The circle&#x27;s center is found to be \( (0, -\frac{7}{8}) \) and the radius is calculated as \( \frac{9}{8} \).

### Image of the Imaginary Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = is \) where \( s \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = is \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(is) = \frac{-s + 2}{i(4s + 1)}
   \]
3. **Simplifying**:
   - This results in purely imaginary numbers, indicating the image is a line (the imaginary axis in the complex plane).

### Conclusion
The real axis is mapped to a circle with radius \( \frac{9}{8} \). The imaginary axis is mapped to a line, which in the extended complex plane can be considered a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem specifies a finite radius, so we conclude the radius of the circle onto which the real axis is mapped is the answer.

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of the circle that the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes onto. Hmm, bilinear transformations, also known as Möbius transformations, right? They have some properties like mapping circles and lines to circles or lines. Since both the real and imaginary axes are lines in the complex plane, their images under this transformation should be either circles or lines. The problem says &quot;onto the circle,&quot; so I guess both axes are mapped to the same circle? Or maybe each axis is mapped to a circle, and we need to find their radii? Wait, the question says &quot;the circle,&quot; so maybe both are mapped to the same circle? Let me check the wording again: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So, both axes are mapped to the same circle, and we need to find its radius. Alright, that makes sense.

First, let me recall that a bilinear transformation is determined by its action on three points. Also, since it&#x27;s a transformation from the extended complex plane to itself, it can map lines to circles and vice versa. The real and imaginary axes are both lines through the origin, but perpendicular to each other. The transformation \( f(z) \) is given, so maybe I can find images of points on the real axis and the imaginary axis and see what circle they lie on.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the real axis and the imaginary axis, plug them into the transformation, and then find the equation of the image curve, which should be a circle, and then find its radius.

Let me try this approach.

First, let&#x27;s handle the real axis. The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \), where \( t \) is a real number. Then, substitute \( z = t \) into the transformation:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \).

Similarly, the imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = i s \), where \( s \) is a real number. Substituting \( z = i s \):

\( f(i s) = \frac{i (i s) + 2}{4 (i s) + i} = \frac{-s + 2}{4 i s + i} = \frac{(-s + 2)}{i (4 s + 1)} \).

Let me compute both images and see if they lie on the same circle.

Starting with the real axis:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \). Let me write this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let me denote \( f(t) = u + iv \).

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize:

Denominator: \( 4 t + i \), conjugate is \( 4 t - i \).

So,

\( f(t) = \frac{(i t + 2)(4 t - i)}{(4 t + i)(4 t - i)} \).

Compute the denominator first:

\( (4 t)^2 - (i)^2 = 16 t^2 - (-1) = 16 t^2 + 1 \).

Numerator:

Expand \( (i t + 2)(4 t - i) \):

First term: \( i t \cdot 4 t = 4 i t^2 \)

Second term: \( i t \cdot (-i) = -i^2 t = -(-1) t = t \)

Third term: \( 2 \cdot 4 t = 8 t \)

Fourth term: \( 2 \cdot (-i) = -2 i \)

So combining all terms:

\( 4 i t^2 + t + 8 t - 2 i = 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \).

Therefore, the numerator is \( 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \), and the denominator is \( 16 t^2 + 1 \).

So, separating into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( 9 t / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Imaginary part: \( (4 t^2 - 2) / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Therefore, \( f(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \).

So, parametrizing the image of the real axis as \( (u(t), v(t)) \), where:

\( u(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

\( v(t) = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

Now, to find the equation of the circle that these points lie on, I can try to eliminate the parameter \( t \) from the equations for \( u \) and \( v \).

Let me set:

\( u = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (1)

\( v = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (2)

Let me solve equation (1) for \( t \):

From (1):

\( u (16 t^2 + 1) = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 + u = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 - 9 t + u = 0 \)

This is a quadratic equation in \( t \), but maybe it&#x27;s messy to solve for \( t \). Alternatively, let me express \( t \) from equation (1) in terms of \( u \), but it&#x27;s a quadratic, so maybe another approach.

Alternatively, notice that from equation (2), we can express \( 16 t^2 + 1 \) as denominator, so let me denote \( D = 16 t^2 + 1 \). Then:

\( u = 9 t / D \)

\( v = (4 t^2 - 2)/D \)

Then, let&#x27;s compute \( u^2 + v^2 \):

\( u^2 + v^2 = (81 t^2 + (4 t^2 - 2)^2) / D^2 \)

Compute numerator:

\( 81 t^2 + (16 t^4 - 16 t^2 + 4) = 16 t^4 + (81 t^2 - 16 t^2) + 4 = 16 t^4 + 65 t^2 + 4 \)

But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, express \( t \) in terms of \( u \) and substitute into \( v \).

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider that the image lies on a circle, so its equation can be written as \( (u - a)^2 + (v - b)^2 = r^2 \). We need to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( r \).

But since both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to the same circle, we might need to consider points from both images to determine the circle. Alternatively, maybe each axis maps to a circle, and both circles have the same radius? Wait, the problem states &quot;the circle&quot;, so perhaps both axes are mapped to the same circle. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the image of each axis is a circle, and we have to find the radius of each? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes,&quot; which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle, so their images coincide as a circle. Let me check with specific points.

First, check some points on the real axis and see where they are mapped.

Take z = 0 (on real axis): f(0) = (i*0 + 2)/(4*0 + i) = 2 / i = -2i.

Take z = ∞ (on extended real axis): The limit as t approaches ∞ of f(t) = (i t + 2)/(4 t + i) ≈ (i t)/(4 t) = i/4. So f(∞) = i/4.

Take z = 1: f(1) = (i + 2)/(4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 - i):

Numerator: (i + 2)(4 - i) = 4i - i^2 + 8 - 2i = (4i - 2i) + ( -i^2 +8 ) = 2i + 1 +8 = 2i +9

Denominator: (4 + i)(4 - i) = 16 - i^2 = 17

Thus, f(1) = (9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (9/17, 2/17)

Similarly, take z = -1: f(-1) = (-i + 2)/(-4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (-4 - i):

Numerator: (-i + 2)(-4 - i) = (-i)(-4) + (-i)(-i) + 2*(-4) + 2*(-i) = 4i + i^2 -8 -2i = (4i - 2i) + (-1 -8) = 2i -9

Denominator: (-4 + i)(-4 -i) = 16 - (i)^2 = 17

Thus, f(-1) = (-9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (-9/17, 2/17)

So these points are on the image of the real axis. Similarly, the points when z approaches 0 and ∞ are -2i and i/4. So plotting these points: -2i, i/4, (9/17, 2/17), (-9/17, 2/17). Hmm, these points seem to lie on a circle. Let&#x27;s check if they lie on the same circle.

First, let&#x27;s check if points -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17) lie on a circle.

A circle in the complex plane can be represented as |w - c| = r, where c is the center and r is the radius.

Let me consider three points: -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17).

First, represent these points in coordinates:

-2i is (0, -2)

i/4 is (0, 1/4)

(9/17, 2/17) is (9/17, 2/17)

So, three points: (0, -2), (0, 1/4), (9/17, 2/17)

We need to find the circle passing through these three points.

Let me denote the circle equation as \( (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Plugging in the three points:

1. For (0, -2):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (-2 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

2. For (0, 1/4):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (1/4 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

3. For (9/17, 2/17):

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

\( [a^2 + (b + 2)^2] - [a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( (b + 2)^2 - (b - 1/4)^2 = 0 \)

Expand both squares:

\( [b^2 +4b +4] - [b^2 - (1/2)b + 1/16] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( b^2 +4b +4 -b^2 + (1/2)b -1/16 = 0 \)

Combine like terms:

\( (4b + (1/2)b) + (4 - 1/16) = 0 \)

\( (9/2)b + (63/16) = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:

\( 72b + 63 = 0 \)

=&gt; 72b = -63 =&gt; b = -63/72 = -7/8

So, the y-coordinate of the center is -7/8.

Now, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 1:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 + 2 = -7/8 + 16/8 = 9/8

So,

\( a^2 + (9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Similarly, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 2:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 - 2/8 = -9/8

Thus,

\( a^2 + (-9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; same as above, so no new information.

Now, use equation 3 with b = -7/8:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - (-7/8))^2 = r^2 \)

First, compute 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16/136 + 119/136) = 135/136

So,

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = r^2 \)

We also have from equation 1: \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Set them equal:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Expand the left side:

\( (81/289 - (18/17)a + a^2) + (18225/18496) = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Simplify:

\( a^2 - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Cancel \( a^2 \):

\( - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = 81/64 \)

Multiply all terms by 18496 (which is 17^2 * 16^2) to eliminate denominators:

Let&#x27;s compute each term:

- (18/17)a * 18496 = -18 * 18496 /17 * a = -18*1088*a = -19584 a

81/289 *18496 = 81 * (18496 /289) = 81 * 64 = 5184

18225/18496 *18496 = 18225

81/64 *18496 = 81 * 18496 /64 = 81 * 289 = 23409

So the equation becomes:

-19584a + 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Compute 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Thus:

-19584a + 23409 = 23409

Subtract 23409:

-19584a = 0 =&gt; a = 0

Therefore, the center is at (0, -7/8) and radius squared is \( a^2 + 81/64 = 81/64 \), so radius is 9/8.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Wait, but let&#x27;s check if the point (9/17, 2/17) lies on this circle.

Center is (0, -7/8), radius 9/8.

Compute distance from (9/17, 2/17) to (0, -7/8):

Difference in x: 9/17 - 0 = 9/17

Difference in y: 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16 + 119)/136 = 135/136

Compute the distance squared:

(9/17)^2 + (135/136)^2

= 81/289 + 18225/18496

Convert to common denominator:

81/289 = (81 * 64)/ (289 * 64) = 5184/18496

18225/18496

Sum: 5184 + 18225 = 23409 /18496 = (153)^2 / (136)^2 = (153/136)^2

But 153 = 9*17, 136 = 8*17, so 153/136 = 9/8. Hence, distance squared is (9/8)^2, so distance is 9/8, which matches the radius. So, yes, the point is on the circle.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Now, let&#x27;s check the image of the imaginary axis. Earlier, we parametrized z = i s, so:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } \)

Let me simplify this expression.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s + 1)(-i) } \)

Wait, denominator: i*(4s +1)*(-i) = -i^2*(4s +1) = (1)*(4s +1) = 4s +1.

Numerator: (-s + 2)(-i) = (s - 2)i

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \)

So, written as \( u + iv \), this is:

\( u = 0 \), \( v = \frac{ s - 2 }{ 4s +1 } \)

Wait, hold on: Wait, if \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then the real part is 0 and the imaginary part is \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), right? Because multiplying by i gives a purely imaginary number.

Wait, but no: Let me check again. If we have \( \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then that&#x27;s equal to \( i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is a purely imaginary number. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points \( 0 + i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is the imaginary axis in the complex plane? But parametrized by s. Wait, but s is real, except when 4s +1 =0, i.e., s = -1/4, which would be a point at infinity.

But hold on, the image is a subset of the imaginary axis? But that can&#x27;t be, since the problem states that the transformation maps the axes to a circle. But according to this, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let&#x27;s recast the computation of f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis.

Given \( z = i s \), then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i} = \frac{ -s + 2 }{4i s + i } \)

Factor out i from the denominator:

\( \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } = \frac{ (-s + 2) }{i (4 s + 1)} \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1) } \)

Because denominator: \( i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1 \), so denominator becomes \( (4 s +1) \)

So, numerator is \( (s - 2)i \), so \( f(z) = \frac{(s - 2)i}{4 s +1 } \)

Therefore, this is a purely imaginary number scaled by \( \frac{(s - 2)}{4 s +1 } \). So the image is the imaginary axis? But parametrized with a real parameter s. Wait, but except when 4 s +1 =0, which would be s = -1/4, but as s approaches -1/4, the image goes to infinity.

But the imaginary axis is a line, not a circle. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. But since bilinear transformations map circles and lines to circles or lines, the image of the imaginary axis under this transformation is either a line or a circle. But according to this computation, it&#x27;s the imaginary axis, which is a line. But the problem states that it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So if the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line, then they can&#x27;t both be mapped to the same circle. But according to the problem statement, it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle onto which both axes are mapped. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my computation.

Wait, let&#x27;s re-examine the transformation. The transformation is \( f(z) = \frac{ i z + 2 }{4 z + i } \). Let me check if it&#x27;s invertible. The determinant of the coefficients matrix is (i)(i) - (2)(4) = (-1) - 8 = -9 ≠ 0, so it&#x27;s invertible.

Wait, when I computed the image of the imaginary axis, I substituted z = i s and found that f(z) is purely imaginary. But that would imply the image is the imaginary axis, but that contradicts the problem&#x27;s statement. Hmm. So perhaps my error is in the calculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s recompute the image of z = i s:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i } \)

Compute numerator: \( i^2 s + 2 = -s + 2 \)

Denominator: \( 4i s + i = i(4 s +1 ) \)

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i(4 s + 1) } \)

To express this in terms of real and imaginary parts, we can multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i(4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1 ) } \)

Since the denominator was multiplied by -i, which is the conjugate of i, to make it real.

Thus, the result is \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s +1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). So, as s varies over real numbers (excluding s = -1/4), the image is all purely imaginary numbers except when s approaches -1/4, which would approach infinity.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under f(z) is the imaginary axis in the w-plane, plus the point at infinity. But in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem states that both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to a circle. But according to the computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8 and center at (0, -7/8), while the imaginary axis is mapped to the imaginary line (which is a circle through infinity). Therefore, there must be an error here.

But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;. Maybe the problem is that in the finite plane, the image of the imaginary axis is a line, but perhaps when considering the extended complex plane, the line together with the point at infinity forms a circle. However, in that case, the radius would be infinite, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I have a miscalculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s check with specific points on the imaginary axis.

Take z = 0 (on imaginary axis? Wait, z=0 is on both axes, but in the parametrization z = i s, when s = 0, we get z=0. Then f(0) = 2/i = -2i, which is the same as before.

Take z = i (s=1): f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

Take z = 2i (s=2): f(2i) = (i*2i + 2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 + 2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) = 0.

Take z = i/2 (s=1/2): f(i/2) = (i*(i/2) +2)/(4*(i/2) +i) = (-1/2 + 2)/(2i +i) = (3/2)/(3i) = (3/2)/(3i) = 1/(2i) = -i/2.

Take z approaching infinity along the imaginary axis: s approaches infinity, so f(z) = ( -s + 2 ) / (4i s +i ) ≈ -s / 4i s = -1/(4i) = i/4.

So the images are: -2i, -i/5, 0, -i/2, and i/4. These points are all on the imaginary axis. So when s approaches infinity, f(z) approaches i/4, which is a finite point. When s approaches -1/4, the denominator 4s +1 approaches zero, so f(z) approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which in the extended complex plane is a circle. But in the standard complex plane, it&#x27;s a line. However, since Möbius transformations map lines to circles or lines, depending on whether they pass through the pole of the transformation.

But in our case, the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is not on the imaginary axis (since the imaginary axis is z = iy, and -i/4 is on the imaginary axis). Wait, z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis. Wait, the denominator 4z +i =0 when z = -i/4. Therefore, the point z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, and thus the transformation has a pole there. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation should be a circle, because the pole is on the original axis, so the image is a circle.

But according to the previous computation, the image seems to be the entire imaginary axis. But that contradicts. Wait, perhaps there&#x27;s a mistake here.

Wait, if the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is on the imaginary axis, then the image of the imaginary axis should be a circle in the extended complex plane. However, when we parameterized it, we obtained the entire imaginary axis except for the point at s = -1/4, which maps to infinity. Therefore, in the extended complex plane, the image is the imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which is a &quot;circle&quot; passing through infinity, i.e., a line. But according to Möbius transformation properties, if the original line passes through the pole, then the image is a line; otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle. Wait, maybe that&#x27;s the key.

Wait, the general property is that Möbius transformations map circles and lines to circles and lines. A line can be considered a circle passing through infinity. If the original line passes through the pole of the transformation (the point where the denominator is zero), then the image will pass through infinity, hence it&#x27;s a line. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle.

In our case, the real axis does not pass through the pole z = -i/4, since the pole is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle. The imaginary axis does pass through the pole z = -i/4, so its image is a line (the extended line, i.e., a circle passing through infinity).

But the problem states that the transformation maps both the real and imaginary axes onto the same circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Therefore, either the problem is ill-posed, or my computations are wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the image of each axis separately, and both images are circles, but with the same radius? Let me check again.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute the image of the imaginary axis again more carefully.

Parametrizing z = i s, then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (2 - s) }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(z) = \frac{ (2 - s)(-i) }{ (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ 4 s + 1 } \)

Thus, this is equal to \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s + 1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). Therefore, as s varies over ℝ \ { -1/4 }, the image is all imaginary numbers. However, when s approaches -1/4, the denominator approaches zero, so the image approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the extended imaginary axis (including infinity), which is a line in the extended complex plane. But the problem says it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle, which suggests a finite circle.

But according to my previous calculation, the image of the real axis is a circle with radius 9/8. However, the problem mentions &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle. But according to my computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misstated, or I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check another point on the imaginary axis. Take z = -i/4, which is the pole. But z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so it&#x27;s mapped to infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line plus infinity, which is a line in the extended plane. So that can&#x27;t be a circle. However, the problem says &quot;onto the circle&quot;, so maybe the question is actually only referring to the real axis? Or maybe the problem is in error.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation when considering the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s consider another approach. Let&#x27;s suppose that both images are circles. Wait, but we saw that the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line. However, maybe in the extended plane, the line is considered a circle, but the problem is asking for the radius in the standard plane, so only the real axis&#x27;s image is a circle with finite radius, and the imaginary axis&#x27;s image is a line, which has infinite radius. But the problem says &quot;the circle&quot;, so maybe the answer is 9/8, the radius from the real axis image.

But the problem states: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; If both axes are mapped to the same circle, but our calculation shows that the real axis is mapped to a circle and the imaginary axis to a line, there&#x27;s a problem. Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s try parametrizing the image of the imaginary axis again. Suppose I write w = f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis, so z = iy, y ∈ ℝ.

Then, w = (i*(iy) + 2)/(4*(iy) + i) = (-y + 2)/(4iy + i) = (2 - y)/(i(4y +1)).

Let me write w = u + iv.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

w = (2 - y)(-i)/(i(4y +1)(-i)) = (-i(2 - y))/( (4y +1) )

The denominator simplifies to (4y +1) because i*(-i) = 1.

Therefore, w = -i(2 - y)/(4y +1 ) = [ (y - 2)/(4y +1) ] i.

So, w is purely imaginary, with v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ), and u = 0.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ) for real y ≠ -1/4.

To see if this is a circle, we can parametrize v in terms of y:

Let me set t = y, then v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

This is a hyperbola or a straight line?

Wait, solving for t:

v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

Multiply both sides by (4t +1):

v(4t +1 ) = t -2

4v t + v = t -2

4v t - t = -2 - v

t(4v -1 ) = - (2 + v )

Therefore,

t = - (2 + v ) / (4v -1 )

This shows that for each v ≠ 1/4, there&#x27;s a corresponding t. But this parametrization covers all real numbers except v = 1/4, which would require the denominator 4v -1 =0, i.e., v=1/4. When v approaches 1/4, t approaches infinity.

But the image is the set of all points (0, v) where v can be any real number except v=1/4. Wait, but in reality, when t approaches infinity, v = (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t/(4t ) = 1/4. So, as t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4 from below. Similarly, when t approaches -1/4 from the right, denominator approaches zero, and v approaches ± infinity depending on the direction.

Wait, let&#x27;s analyze the function v(t) = (t -2)/(4t +1 )

Find the range of v(t):

As t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4.

As t approaches -1/4 from above, denominator approaches 0+, numerator approaches (-1/4 - 2 )= -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0+ = -infty.

As t approaches -1/4 from below, denominator approaches 0-, numerator approaches -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0- = +infty.

At t = 2, v=0.

Therefore, the function v(t) maps:

t ∈ (-∞, -1/4 ) to v ∈ (1/4, +infty ) (wait, hold on):

Wait, let&#x27;s check:

For t &lt; -1/4:

Denominator 4t +1 &lt; 0.

Numerator t -2: If t approaches -infty, t -2 approaches -infty.

So for t &lt; -1/4:

v = (negative)/(negative) = positive.

As t approaches -infty, v ≈ t /4t = 1/4. So from above.

Wait, as t approaches -infty, (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t /4t = 1/4, approaching 1/4 from above? Wait:

Let me compute the limit as t approaches -infty:

(t -2)/(4t +1 ) = [ t (1 - 2/t ) ] / [ t (4 + 1/t ) ] = (1 - 0)/(4 +0 ) = 1/4. So as t approaches -infty, v approaches 1/4 from above (since numerator is negative and denominator is negative, making positive, and when t approaches -infty, the difference from 1/4 is positive). Wait, not sure. Let me plug in t = -N where N is a large positive number:

v = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (N +2)/(4N -1 ) ≈ N /4N = 1/4. So approaching 1/4 from above? Let&#x27;s compute for large N:

(N +2)/(4N -1 ) = [N(1 + 2/N )]/[N(4 -1/N ) ] = (1 + 2/N )/(4 -1/N ) ≈ (1 +0 )/(4 -0 ) = 1/4. So as N increases, the value approaches 1/4 from slightly above? Let&#x27;s take N=1000:

(1000 +2 )/(4000 -1 ) = 1002/3999 ≈ 0.2506, which is slightly more than 1/4. So yes, approaches 1/4 from above.

Similarly, for t approaching -1/4 from the left (t approaching -1/4- ):

t approaching -1/4 from below (t = -1/4 - ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 - ε -2 ) = -9/4 - ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 - ε ) +1 = -1 -4ε +1 = -4ε

So v = (-9/4 - ε )/(-4ε ) = (9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (9/4)/4ε = 9/(16ε ), which approaches +infty as ε→0+.

For t approaching -1/4 from the right (t = -1/4 + ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 + ε -2 ) = -9/4 + ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 + ε ) +1 = -1 +4ε +1 = 4ε

v = (-9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (-9/4)/4ε = -9/(16ε ), which approaches -infty as ε→0+.

At t = 2: v=0.

Therefore, the range of v(t) is:

- When t ∈ (-infty, -1/4 ), v ∈ (1/4, +infty )

- When t ∈ (-1/4, ∞ ), v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 )

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 ) ∪ (1/4, +infty ), i.e., the entire imaginary axis except the point v=1/4. But in the extended complex plane, we include infinity, so the image is the entire imaginary axis (as a line), which makes sense because the pole at z=-i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so the image is a line.

But according to the problem statement, we should map both axes to a circle. This suggests a discrepancy. However, earlier computation showed that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I misinterpreted it. Maybe it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle that the real axis is mapped to, and separately the radius for the imaginary axis? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which seems to imply a single circle. But according to my calculations, they are mapped to different circles (one a finite circle, one a line). This is confusing.

Wait, maybe there&#x27;s a mistake in the computation for the image of the imaginary axis. Let me try a different approach. Instead of parametrizing z = i s, perhaps I should consider the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation f(z) and see if it can be represented as a circle.

The general method for finding the image of a line under a Möbius transformation is to take three points on the original line, find their images, and then determine the circle or line through those points.

Let&#x27;s apply this method to the imaginary axis.

Take three points on the imaginary axis:

1. z = 0: f(0) = 2/i = -2i.

2. z = i: f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

3. z = ∞: The transformation as z approaches ∞ along the imaginary axis: f(z) = (i*z + 2)/(4*z + i) ≈ (i*z)/(4*z) = i/4.

So the three image points are -2i, -i/5, and i/4.

These three points are on the imaginary axis. To determine if they lie on a circle, note that three colinear points (on the same line) lie on an infinite number of circles, but in the standard plane, the only circle that includes them is the line itself, considered as a circle with infinite radius. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line, which is a &quot;circle&quot; with infinite radius. But the problem asks for the radius of the circle, which is finite. Therefore, this suggests that only the real axis is mapped to a circle with finite radius, and the answer should be 9/8.

However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the circle, which contradicts our findings. Therefore, perhaps there&#x27;s an error in the problem or in my solution.

Wait, let&#x27;s cross-verify the image of the real axis. We found that it&#x27;s a circle with center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. Let me check if the images of the real axis include points from the imaginary axis&#x27;s image. For example, take z =0 (on both axes), maps to -2i, which is on the circle (distance from center (0, -7/8) to -2i (0, -2) is | -2 - (-7/8)| = |-16/8 +7/8| = |-9/8| = 9/8, which is the radius. So yes, -2i is on the circle. The point at infinity maps to i/4, which is also on the circle: center (0, -7/8), distance to i/4 (0, 1/4) is |1/4 - (-7/8)| = |1/4 +7/8| = |9/8| =9/8, which is the radius. The images of the real axis include points like i/4 and -2i, which are also images of points on the imaginary axis. Wait, hold on. The image of the real axis includes the point -2i (image of z=0) and i/4 (image of z=∞), which are also images of points on the imaginary axis (z=0 and z=∞). Similarly, images of the imaginary axis include -2i, which is also on the real axis&#x27;s image. Wait, but the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, but the circle we found for the real axis&#x27;s image includes some points on the imaginary axis. Specifically, the circle intersects the imaginary axis at -2i and i/4. But the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, which includes these two points. Therefore, perhaps the problem is referring to the circle that is the image of the real axis, and the image of the imaginary axis is the line that coincides with the imaginary axis, intersecting the circle at -2i and i/4. However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the same circle. Since the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line intersecting that circle at two points, but not the entire circle. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my previous reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary line. Let me check with another point.

Take z = 2i (s=2). Then f(2i) = (i*2i +2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 +2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) =0, which is on the real axis&#x27;s image circle? Let&#x27;s check. The circle has center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. The point 0 is at (0,0). The distance from (0,0) to (0, -7/8) is 7/8, which is less than 9/8, so 0 is inside the circle. Wait, but 0 is the image of z=2i, which is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, 0 is inside the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis includes points inside the circle. But the image of the real axis is the circle itself. So the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary axis, which intersects the circle at -2i and i/4, and passes through 0 inside the circle. Therefore, the two images are different: one is a circle, the other is a line intersecting the circle. So the problem statement must be incorrect, or I have a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem is to find the radius of the circle that both axes are mapped to, implying that both images coincide. In that case, my previous calculation must be wrong.

Wait, let&#x27;s see. The transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let me check if it&#x27;s an involution or has some symmetry. Let me compute f(f(z)):

Compute f(f(z)):

First, f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let&#x27;s substitute w = f(z):

f(w) = (i w +2 )/(4 w +i )

Substitute w = (i z +2)/(4 z +i ):

= [ i*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +2 ] / [4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ]

Simplify numerator:

[ (i^2 z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2 ] = [ (-z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2*(4 z +i )/(4 z +i ) ]

= [ (-z + 2i +8 z +2i )/(4 z +i ) ] = [7 z +4i )/(4 z +i )

Denominator:

[4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ] = [4i z +8 +i*(4 z +i ) ]/(4 z +i )

= [4i z +8 +4i z +i^2 ]/(4 z +i )

= [8i z +8 -1 ]/(4 z +i )

= (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i )

Therefore, f(f(z)) = [ (7 z +4i )/(4 z +i ) ] / [ (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i ) ] = (7 z +4i )/(8i z +7 )

This is not equal to z, so f is not an involution. Therefore, there&#x27;s no immediate symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation maps both axes to the same circle due to some symmetry. But my previous computations do not support this. The real axis maps to a circle, and the imaginary axis maps to a line. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in my solution.

Alternatively, maybe the question is to find the radius for each axis separately. For the real axis, we have radius 9/8. For the imaginary axis, since it&#x27;s mapped to a line, which can be thought of as a circle with infinite radius, but the problem asks for a finite radius. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 9/8.

Given the problem&#x27;s wording, and since the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line (infinite radius), but the problem mentions &quot;the circle&quot;, likely referring to the real axis&#x27;s image, which is a finite circle, the answer should be 9/8.

But to confirm, let&#x27;s see if any other references or methods can show that both images are the same circle.

Alternatively, suppose we consider the transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i )

Let me check if it maps the real axis to a circle and the imaginary axis to the same circle.

From previous calculations, the real axis maps to a circle with center (0, -7/8 ) and radius 9/8. The imaginary axis maps to the imaginary line, which intersects this circle at -2i and i/4. The points -2i and i/4 are both on the circle, as:

Distance from -2i (0, -2) to center (0, -7/8 ) is | -2 - (-7/8 ) | = |-9/8 | =9/8.

Distance from i/4 (0, 1/4 ) to center (0, -7/8 ) is |1/4 - (-7/8 ) | = |9/8 | =9/8.

But the rest of the imaginary axis is not on the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis is the line passing through -2i and i/4 and extending to infinity, which is the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is not the same as the image of the real axis, unless we consider the extended line as a circle, which has infinite radius.

Given that the problem asks for the radius of the circle, expecting a finite number, and given that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, I think the answer is 9/8.

Therefore, the radius is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the circle is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes, we analyze the images of these axes under the transformation.

### Image of the Real Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \) where \( t \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = t \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i}
   \]
3. **Separating Real and Imaginary Parts**:
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
   This gives the parametric equations:
   \[
   u(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1}, \quad v(t) = \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
4. **Finding the Circle**:
   - By eliminating the parameter \( t \), we find that the image lies on a circle.
   - The circle&#x27;s center is found to be \( (0, -\frac{7}{8}) \) and the radius is calculated as \( \frac{9}{8} \).

### Image of the Imaginary Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = is \) where \( s \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = is \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(is) = \frac{-s + 2}{i(4s + 1)}
   \]
3. **Simplifying**:
   - This results in purely imaginary numbers, indicating the image is a line (the imaginary axis in the complex plane).

### Conclusion
The real axis is mapped to a circle with radius \( \frac{9}{8} \). The imaginary axis is mapped to a line, which in the extended complex plane can be considered a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem specifies a finite radius, so we conclude the radius of the circle onto which the real axis is mapped is the answer.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of the circle that the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes onto. Hmm, bilinear transformations, also known as Möbius transformations, right? They have some properties like mapping circles and lines to circles or lines. Since both the real and imaginary axes are lines in the complex plane, their images under this transformation should be either circles or lines. The problem says &quot;onto the circle,&quot; so I guess both axes are mapped to the same circle? Or maybe each axis is mapped to a circle, and we need to find their radii? Wait, the question says &quot;the circle,&quot; so maybe both are mapped to the same circle? Let me check the wording again: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So, both axes are mapped to the same circle, and we need to find its radius. Alright, that makes sense.

First, let me recall that a bilinear transformation is determined by its action on three points. Also, since it&#x27;s a transformation from the extended complex plane to itself, it can map lines to circles and vice versa. The real and imaginary axes are both lines through the origin, but perpendicular to each other. The transformation \( f(z) \) is given, so maybe I can find images of points on the real axis and the imaginary axis and see what circle they lie on.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the real axis and the imaginary axis, plug them into the transformation, and then find the equation of the image curve, which should be a circle, and then find its radius.

Let me try this approach.

First, let&#x27;s handle the real axis. The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \), where \( t \) is a real number. Then, substitute \( z = t \) into the transformation:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \).

Similarly, the imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = i s \), where \( s \) is a real number. Substituting \( z = i s \):

\( f(i s) = \frac{i (i s) + 2}{4 (i s) + i} = \frac{-s + 2}{4 i s + i} = \frac{(-s + 2)}{i (4 s + 1)} \).

Let me compute both images and see if they lie on the same circle.

Starting with the real axis:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \). Let me write this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let me denote \( f(t) = u + iv \).

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize:

Denominator: \( 4 t + i \), conjugate is \( 4 t - i \).

So,

\( f(t) = \frac{(i t + 2)(4 t - i)}{(4 t + i)(4 t - i)} \).

Compute the denominator first:

\( (4 t)^2 - (i)^2 = 16 t^2 - (-1) = 16 t^2 + 1 \).

Numerator:

Expand \( (i t + 2)(4 t - i) \):

First term: \( i t \cdot 4 t = 4 i t^2 \)

Second term: \( i t \cdot (-i) = -i^2 t = -(-1) t = t \)

Third term: \( 2 \cdot 4 t = 8 t \)

Fourth term: \( 2 \cdot (-i) = -2 i \)

So combining all terms:

\( 4 i t^2 + t + 8 t - 2 i = 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \).

Therefore, the numerator is \( 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \), and the denominator is \( 16 t^2 + 1 \).

So, separating into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( 9 t / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Imaginary part: \( (4 t^2 - 2) / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Therefore, \( f(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \).

So, parametrizing the image of the real axis as \( (u(t), v(t)) \), where:

\( u(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

\( v(t) = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

Now, to find the equation of the circle that these points lie on, I can try to eliminate the parameter \( t \) from the equations for \( u \) and \( v \).

Let me set:

\( u = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (1)

\( v = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (2)

Let me solve equation (1) for \( t \):

From (1):

\( u (16 t^2 + 1) = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 + u = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 - 9 t + u = 0 \)

This is a quadratic equation in \( t \), but maybe it&#x27;s messy to solve for \( t \). Alternatively, let me express \( t \) from equation (1) in terms of \( u \), but it&#x27;s a quadratic, so maybe another approach.

Alternatively, notice that from equation (2), we can express \( 16 t^2 + 1 \) as denominator, so let me denote \( D = 16 t^2 + 1 \). Then:

\( u = 9 t / D \)

\( v = (4 t^2 - 2)/D \)

Then, let&#x27;s compute \( u^2 + v^2 \):

\( u^2 + v^2 = (81 t^2 + (4 t^2 - 2)^2) / D^2 \)

Compute numerator:

\( 81 t^2 + (16 t^4 - 16 t^2 + 4) = 16 t^4 + (81 t^2 - 16 t^2) + 4 = 16 t^4 + 65 t^2 + 4 \)

But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, express \( t \) in terms of \( u \) and substitute into \( v \).

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider that the image lies on a circle, so its equation can be written as \( (u - a)^2 + (v - b)^2 = r^2 \). We need to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( r \).

But since both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to the same circle, we might need to consider points from both images to determine the circle. Alternatively, maybe each axis maps to a circle, and both circles have the same radius? Wait, the problem states &quot;the circle&quot;, so perhaps both axes are mapped to the same circle. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the image of each axis is a circle, and we have to find the radius of each? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes,&quot; which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle, so their images coincide as a circle. Let me check with specific points.

First, check some points on the real axis and see where they are mapped.

Take z = 0 (on real axis): f(0) = (i*0 + 2)/(4*0 + i) = 2 / i = -2i.

Take z = ∞ (on extended real axis): The limit as t approaches ∞ of f(t) = (i t + 2)/(4 t + i) ≈ (i t)/(4 t) = i/4. So f(∞) = i/4.

Take z = 1: f(1) = (i + 2)/(4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 - i):

Numerator: (i + 2)(4 - i) = 4i - i^2 + 8 - 2i = (4i - 2i) + ( -i^2 +8 ) = 2i + 1 +8 = 2i +9

Denominator: (4 + i)(4 - i) = 16 - i^2 = 17

Thus, f(1) = (9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (9/17, 2/17)

Similarly, take z = -1: f(-1) = (-i + 2)/(-4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (-4 - i):

Numerator: (-i + 2)(-4 - i) = (-i)(-4) + (-i)(-i) + 2*(-4) + 2*(-i) = 4i + i^2 -8 -2i = (4i - 2i) + (-1 -8) = 2i -9

Denominator: (-4 + i)(-4 -i) = 16 - (i)^2 = 17

Thus, f(-1) = (-9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (-9/17, 2/17)

So these points are on the image of the real axis. Similarly, the points when z approaches 0 and ∞ are -2i and i/4. So plotting these points: -2i, i/4, (9/17, 2/17), (-9/17, 2/17). Hmm, these points seem to lie on a circle. Let&#x27;s check if they lie on the same circle.

First, let&#x27;s check if points -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17) lie on a circle.

A circle in the complex plane can be represented as |w - c| = r, where c is the center and r is the radius.

Let me consider three points: -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17).

First, represent these points in coordinates:

-2i is (0, -2)

i/4 is (0, 1/4)

(9/17, 2/17) is (9/17, 2/17)

So, three points: (0, -2), (0, 1/4), (9/17, 2/17)

We need to find the circle passing through these three points.

Let me denote the circle equation as \( (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Plugging in the three points:

1. For (0, -2):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (-2 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

2. For (0, 1/4):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (1/4 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

3. For (9/17, 2/17):

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

\( [a^2 + (b + 2)^2] - [a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( (b + 2)^2 - (b - 1/4)^2 = 0 \)

Expand both squares:

\( [b^2 +4b +4] - [b^2 - (1/2)b + 1/16] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( b^2 +4b +4 -b^2 + (1/2)b -1/16 = 0 \)

Combine like terms:

\( (4b + (1/2)b) + (4 - 1/16) = 0 \)

\( (9/2)b + (63/16) = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:

\( 72b + 63 = 0 \)

=&gt; 72b = -63 =&gt; b = -63/72 = -7/8

So, the y-coordinate of the center is -7/8.

Now, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 1:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 + 2 = -7/8 + 16/8 = 9/8

So,

\( a^2 + (9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Similarly, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 2:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 - 2/8 = -9/8

Thus,

\( a^2 + (-9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; same as above, so no new information.

Now, use equation 3 with b = -7/8:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - (-7/8))^2 = r^2 \)

First, compute 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16/136 + 119/136) = 135/136

So,

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = r^2 \)

We also have from equation 1: \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Set them equal:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Expand the left side:

\( (81/289 - (18/17)a + a^2) + (18225/18496) = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Simplify:

\( a^2 - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Cancel \( a^2 \):

\( - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = 81/64 \)

Multiply all terms by 18496 (which is 17^2 * 16^2) to eliminate denominators:

Let&#x27;s compute each term:

- (18/17)a * 18496 = -18 * 18496 /17 * a = -18*1088*a = -19584 a

81/289 *18496 = 81 * (18496 /289) = 81 * 64 = 5184

18225/18496 *18496 = 18225

81/64 *18496 = 81 * 18496 /64 = 81 * 289 = 23409

So the equation becomes:

-19584a + 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Compute 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Thus:

-19584a + 23409 = 23409

Subtract 23409:

-19584a = 0 =&gt; a = 0

Therefore, the center is at (0, -7/8) and radius squared is \( a^2 + 81/64 = 81/64 \), so radius is 9/8.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Wait, but let&#x27;s check if the point (9/17, 2/17) lies on this circle.

Center is (0, -7/8), radius 9/8.

Compute distance from (9/17, 2/17) to (0, -7/8):

Difference in x: 9/17 - 0 = 9/17

Difference in y: 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16 + 119)/136 = 135/136

Compute the distance squared:

(9/17)^2 + (135/136)^2

= 81/289 + 18225/18496

Convert to common denominator:

81/289 = (81 * 64)/ (289 * 64) = 5184/18496

18225/18496

Sum: 5184 + 18225 = 23409 /18496 = (153)^2 / (136)^2 = (153/136)^2

But 153 = 9*17, 136 = 8*17, so 153/136 = 9/8. Hence, distance squared is (9/8)^2, so distance is 9/8, which matches the radius. So, yes, the point is on the circle.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Now, let&#x27;s check the image of the imaginary axis. Earlier, we parametrized z = i s, so:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } \)

Let me simplify this expression.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s + 1)(-i) } \)

Wait, denominator: i*(4s +1)*(-i) = -i^2*(4s +1) = (1)*(4s +1) = 4s +1.

Numerator: (-s + 2)(-i) = (s - 2)i

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \)

So, written as \( u + iv \), this is:

\( u = 0 \), \( v = \frac{ s - 2 }{ 4s +1 } \)

Wait, hold on: Wait, if \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then the real part is 0 and the imaginary part is \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), right? Because multiplying by i gives a purely imaginary number.

Wait, but no: Let me check again. If we have \( \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then that&#x27;s equal to \( i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is a purely imaginary number. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points \( 0 + i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is the imaginary axis in the complex plane? But parametrized by s. Wait, but s is real, except when 4s +1 =0, i.e., s = -1/4, which would be a point at infinity.

But hold on, the image is a subset of the imaginary axis? But that can&#x27;t be, since the problem states that the transformation maps the axes to a circle. But according to this, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let&#x27;s recast the computation of f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis.

Given \( z = i s \), then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i} = \frac{ -s + 2 }{4i s + i } \)

Factor out i from the denominator:

\( \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } = \frac{ (-s + 2) }{i (4 s + 1)} \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1) } \)

Because denominator: \( i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1 \), so denominator becomes \( (4 s +1) \)

So, numerator is \( (s - 2)i \), so \( f(z) = \frac{(s - 2)i}{4 s +1 } \)

Therefore, this is a purely imaginary number scaled by \( \frac{(s - 2)}{4 s +1 } \). So the image is the imaginary axis? But parametrized with a real parameter s. Wait, but except when 4 s +1 =0, which would be s = -1/4, but as s approaches -1/4, the image goes to infinity.

But the imaginary axis is a line, not a circle. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. But since bilinear transformations map circles and lines to circles or lines, the image of the imaginary axis under this transformation is either a line or a circle. But according to this computation, it&#x27;s the imaginary axis, which is a line. But the problem states that it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So if the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line, then they can&#x27;t both be mapped to the same circle. But according to the problem statement, it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle onto which both axes are mapped. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my computation.

Wait, let&#x27;s re-examine the transformation. The transformation is \( f(z) = \frac{ i z + 2 }{4 z + i } \). Let me check if it&#x27;s invertible. The determinant of the coefficients matrix is (i)(i) - (2)(4) = (-1) - 8 = -9 ≠ 0, so it&#x27;s invertible.

Wait, when I computed the image of the imaginary axis, I substituted z = i s and found that f(z) is purely imaginary. But that would imply the image is the imaginary axis, but that contradicts the problem&#x27;s statement. Hmm. So perhaps my error is in the calculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s recompute the image of z = i s:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i } \)

Compute numerator: \( i^2 s + 2 = -s + 2 \)

Denominator: \( 4i s + i = i(4 s +1 ) \)

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i(4 s + 1) } \)

To express this in terms of real and imaginary parts, we can multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i(4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1 ) } \)

Since the denominator was multiplied by -i, which is the conjugate of i, to make it real.

Thus, the result is \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s +1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). So, as s varies over real numbers (excluding s = -1/4), the image is all purely imaginary numbers except when s approaches -1/4, which would approach infinity.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under f(z) is the imaginary axis in the w-plane, plus the point at infinity. But in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem states that both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to a circle. But according to the computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8 and center at (0, -7/8), while the imaginary axis is mapped to the imaginary line (which is a circle through infinity). Therefore, there must be an error here.

But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;. Maybe the problem is that in the finite plane, the image of the imaginary axis is a line, but perhaps when considering the extended complex plane, the line together with the point at infinity forms a circle. However, in that case, the radius would be infinite, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I have a miscalculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s check with specific points on the imaginary axis.

Take z = 0 (on imaginary axis? Wait, z=0 is on both axes, but in the parametrization z = i s, when s = 0, we get z=0. Then f(0) = 2/i = -2i, which is the same as before.

Take z = i (s=1): f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

Take z = 2i (s=2): f(2i) = (i*2i + 2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 + 2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) = 0.

Take z = i/2 (s=1/2): f(i/2) = (i*(i/2) +2)/(4*(i/2) +i) = (-1/2 + 2)/(2i +i) = (3/2)/(3i) = (3/2)/(3i) = 1/(2i) = -i/2.

Take z approaching infinity along the imaginary axis: s approaches infinity, so f(z) = ( -s + 2 ) / (4i s +i ) ≈ -s / 4i s = -1/(4i) = i/4.

So the images are: -2i, -i/5, 0, -i/2, and i/4. These points are all on the imaginary axis. So when s approaches infinity, f(z) approaches i/4, which is a finite point. When s approaches -1/4, the denominator 4s +1 approaches zero, so f(z) approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which in the extended complex plane is a circle. But in the standard complex plane, it&#x27;s a line. However, since Möbius transformations map lines to circles or lines, depending on whether they pass through the pole of the transformation.

But in our case, the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is not on the imaginary axis (since the imaginary axis is z = iy, and -i/4 is on the imaginary axis). Wait, z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis. Wait, the denominator 4z +i =0 when z = -i/4. Therefore, the point z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, and thus the transformation has a pole there. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation should be a circle, because the pole is on the original axis, so the image is a circle.

But according to the previous computation, the image seems to be the entire imaginary axis. But that contradicts. Wait, perhaps there&#x27;s a mistake here.

Wait, if the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is on the imaginary axis, then the image of the imaginary axis should be a circle in the extended complex plane. However, when we parameterized it, we obtained the entire imaginary axis except for the point at s = -1/4, which maps to infinity. Therefore, in the extended complex plane, the image is the imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which is a &quot;circle&quot; passing through infinity, i.e., a line. But according to Möbius transformation properties, if the original line passes through the pole, then the image is a line; otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle. Wait, maybe that&#x27;s the key.

Wait, the general property is that Möbius transformations map circles and lines to circles and lines. A line can be considered a circle passing through infinity. If the original line passes through the pole of the transformation (the point where the denominator is zero), then the image will pass through infinity, hence it&#x27;s a line. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle.

In our case, the real axis does not pass through the pole z = -i/4, since the pole is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle. The imaginary axis does pass through the pole z = -i/4, so its image is a line (the extended line, i.e., a circle passing through infinity).

But the problem states that the transformation maps both the real and imaginary axes onto the same circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Therefore, either the problem is ill-posed, or my computations are wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the image of each axis separately, and both images are circles, but with the same radius? Let me check again.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute the image of the imaginary axis again more carefully.

Parametrizing z = i s, then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (2 - s) }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(z) = \frac{ (2 - s)(-i) }{ (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ 4 s + 1 } \)

Thus, this is equal to \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s + 1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). Therefore, as s varies over ℝ \ { -1/4 }, the image is all imaginary numbers. However, when s approaches -1/4, the denominator approaches zero, so the image approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the extended imaginary axis (including infinity), which is a line in the extended complex plane. But the problem says it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle, which suggests a finite circle.

But according to my previous calculation, the image of the real axis is a circle with radius 9/8. However, the problem mentions &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle. But according to my computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misstated, or I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check another point on the imaginary axis. Take z = -i/4, which is the pole. But z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so it&#x27;s mapped to infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line plus infinity, which is a line in the extended plane. So that can&#x27;t be a circle. However, the problem says &quot;onto the circle&quot;, so maybe the question is actually only referring to the real axis? Or maybe the problem is in error.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation when considering the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s consider another approach. Let&#x27;s suppose that both images are circles. Wait, but we saw that the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line. However, maybe in the extended plane, the line is considered a circle, but the problem is asking for the radius in the standard plane, so only the real axis&#x27;s image is a circle with finite radius, and the imaginary axis&#x27;s image is a line, which has infinite radius. But the problem says &quot;the circle&quot;, so maybe the answer is 9/8, the radius from the real axis image.

But the problem states: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; If both axes are mapped to the same circle, but our calculation shows that the real axis is mapped to a circle and the imaginary axis to a line, there&#x27;s a problem. Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s try parametrizing the image of the imaginary axis again. Suppose I write w = f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis, so z = iy, y ∈ ℝ.

Then, w = (i*(iy) + 2)/(4*(iy) + i) = (-y + 2)/(4iy + i) = (2 - y)/(i(4y +1)).

Let me write w = u + iv.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

w = (2 - y)(-i)/(i(4y +1)(-i)) = (-i(2 - y))/( (4y +1) )

The denominator simplifies to (4y +1) because i*(-i) = 1.

Therefore, w = -i(2 - y)/(4y +1 ) = [ (y - 2)/(4y +1) ] i.

So, w is purely imaginary, with v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ), and u = 0.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ) for real y ≠ -1/4.

To see if this is a circle, we can parametrize v in terms of y:

Let me set t = y, then v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

This is a hyperbola or a straight line?

Wait, solving for t:

v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

Multiply both sides by (4t +1):

v(4t +1 ) = t -2

4v t + v = t -2

4v t - t = -2 - v

t(4v -1 ) = - (2 + v )

Therefore,

t = - (2 + v ) / (4v -1 )

This shows that for each v ≠ 1/4, there&#x27;s a corresponding t. But this parametrization covers all real numbers except v = 1/4, which would require the denominator 4v -1 =0, i.e., v=1/4. When v approaches 1/4, t approaches infinity.

But the image is the set of all points (0, v) where v can be any real number except v=1/4. Wait, but in reality, when t approaches infinity, v = (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t/(4t ) = 1/4. So, as t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4 from below. Similarly, when t approaches -1/4 from the right, denominator approaches zero, and v approaches ± infinity depending on the direction.

Wait, let&#x27;s analyze the function v(t) = (t -2)/(4t +1 )

Find the range of v(t):

As t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4.

As t approaches -1/4 from above, denominator approaches 0+, numerator approaches (-1/4 - 2 )= -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0+ = -infty.

As t approaches -1/4 from below, denominator approaches 0-, numerator approaches -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0- = +infty.

At t = 2, v=0.

Therefore, the function v(t) maps:

t ∈ (-∞, -1/4 ) to v ∈ (1/4, +infty ) (wait, hold on):

Wait, let&#x27;s check:

For t &lt; -1/4:

Denominator 4t +1 &lt; 0.

Numerator t -2: If t approaches -infty, t -2 approaches -infty.

So for t &lt; -1/4:

v = (negative)/(negative) = positive.

As t approaches -infty, v ≈ t /4t = 1/4. So from above.

Wait, as t approaches -infty, (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t /4t = 1/4, approaching 1/4 from above? Wait:

Let me compute the limit as t approaches -infty:

(t -2)/(4t +1 ) = [ t (1 - 2/t ) ] / [ t (4 + 1/t ) ] = (1 - 0)/(4 +0 ) = 1/4. So as t approaches -infty, v approaches 1/4 from above (since numerator is negative and denominator is negative, making positive, and when t approaches -infty, the difference from 1/4 is positive). Wait, not sure. Let me plug in t = -N where N is a large positive number:

v = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (N +2)/(4N -1 ) ≈ N /4N = 1/4. So approaching 1/4 from above? Let&#x27;s compute for large N:

(N +2)/(4N -1 ) = [N(1 + 2/N )]/[N(4 -1/N ) ] = (1 + 2/N )/(4 -1/N ) ≈ (1 +0 )/(4 -0 ) = 1/4. So as N increases, the value approaches 1/4 from slightly above? Let&#x27;s take N=1000:

(1000 +2 )/(4000 -1 ) = 1002/3999 ≈ 0.2506, which is slightly more than 1/4. So yes, approaches 1/4 from above.

Similarly, for t approaching -1/4 from the left (t approaching -1/4- ):

t approaching -1/4 from below (t = -1/4 - ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 - ε -2 ) = -9/4 - ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 - ε ) +1 = -1 -4ε +1 = -4ε

So v = (-9/4 - ε )/(-4ε ) = (9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (9/4)/4ε = 9/(16ε ), which approaches +infty as ε→0+.

For t approaching -1/4 from the right (t = -1/4 + ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 + ε -2 ) = -9/4 + ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 + ε ) +1 = -1 +4ε +1 = 4ε

v = (-9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (-9/4)/4ε = -9/(16ε ), which approaches -infty as ε→0+.

At t = 2: v=0.

Therefore, the range of v(t) is:

- When t ∈ (-infty, -1/4 ), v ∈ (1/4, +infty )

- When t ∈ (-1/4, ∞ ), v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 )

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 ) ∪ (1/4, +infty ), i.e., the entire imaginary axis except the point v=1/4. But in the extended complex plane, we include infinity, so the image is the entire imaginary axis (as a line), which makes sense because the pole at z=-i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so the image is a line.

But according to the problem statement, we should map both axes to a circle. This suggests a discrepancy. However, earlier computation showed that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I misinterpreted it. Maybe it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle that the real axis is mapped to, and separately the radius for the imaginary axis? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which seems to imply a single circle. But according to my calculations, they are mapped to different circles (one a finite circle, one a line). This is confusing.

Wait, maybe there&#x27;s a mistake in the computation for the image of the imaginary axis. Let me try a different approach. Instead of parametrizing z = i s, perhaps I should consider the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation f(z) and see if it can be represented as a circle.

The general method for finding the image of a line under a Möbius transformation is to take three points on the original line, find their images, and then determine the circle or line through those points.

Let&#x27;s apply this method to the imaginary axis.

Take three points on the imaginary axis:

1. z = 0: f(0) = 2/i = -2i.

2. z = i: f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

3. z = ∞: The transformation as z approaches ∞ along the imaginary axis: f(z) = (i*z + 2)/(4*z + i) ≈ (i*z)/(4*z) = i/4.

So the three image points are -2i, -i/5, and i/4.

These three points are on the imaginary axis. To determine if they lie on a circle, note that three colinear points (on the same line) lie on an infinite number of circles, but in the standard plane, the only circle that includes them is the line itself, considered as a circle with infinite radius. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line, which is a &quot;circle&quot; with infinite radius. But the problem asks for the radius of the circle, which is finite. Therefore, this suggests that only the real axis is mapped to a circle with finite radius, and the answer should be 9/8.

However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the circle, which contradicts our findings. Therefore, perhaps there&#x27;s an error in the problem or in my solution.

Wait, let&#x27;s cross-verify the image of the real axis. We found that it&#x27;s a circle with center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. Let me check if the images of the real axis include points from the imaginary axis&#x27;s image. For example, take z =0 (on both axes), maps to -2i, which is on the circle (distance from center (0, -7/8) to -2i (0, -2) is | -2 - (-7/8)| = |-16/8 +7/8| = |-9/8| = 9/8, which is the radius. So yes, -2i is on the circle. The point at infinity maps to i/4, which is also on the circle: center (0, -7/8), distance to i/4 (0, 1/4) is |1/4 - (-7/8)| = |1/4 +7/8| = |9/8| =9/8, which is the radius. The images of the real axis include points like i/4 and -2i, which are also images of points on the imaginary axis. Wait, hold on. The image of the real axis includes the point -2i (image of z=0) and i/4 (image of z=∞), which are also images of points on the imaginary axis (z=0 and z=∞). Similarly, images of the imaginary axis include -2i, which is also on the real axis&#x27;s image. Wait, but the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, but the circle we found for the real axis&#x27;s image includes some points on the imaginary axis. Specifically, the circle intersects the imaginary axis at -2i and i/4. But the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, which includes these two points. Therefore, perhaps the problem is referring to the circle that is the image of the real axis, and the image of the imaginary axis is the line that coincides with the imaginary axis, intersecting the circle at -2i and i/4. However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the same circle. Since the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line intersecting that circle at two points, but not the entire circle. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my previous reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary line. Let me check with another point.

Take z = 2i (s=2). Then f(2i) = (i*2i +2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 +2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) =0, which is on the real axis&#x27;s image circle? Let&#x27;s check. The circle has center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. The point 0 is at (0,0). The distance from (0,0) to (0, -7/8) is 7/8, which is less than 9/8, so 0 is inside the circle. Wait, but 0 is the image of z=2i, which is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, 0 is inside the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis includes points inside the circle. But the image of the real axis is the circle itself. So the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary axis, which intersects the circle at -2i and i/4, and passes through 0 inside the circle. Therefore, the two images are different: one is a circle, the other is a line intersecting the circle. So the problem statement must be incorrect, or I have a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem is to find the radius of the circle that both axes are mapped to, implying that both images coincide. In that case, my previous calculation must be wrong.

Wait, let&#x27;s see. The transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let me check if it&#x27;s an involution or has some symmetry. Let me compute f(f(z)):

Compute f(f(z)):

First, f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let&#x27;s substitute w = f(z):

f(w) = (i w +2 )/(4 w +i )

Substitute w = (i z +2)/(4 z +i ):

= [ i*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +2 ] / [4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ]

Simplify numerator:

[ (i^2 z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2 ] = [ (-z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2*(4 z +i )/(4 z +i ) ]

= [ (-z + 2i +8 z +2i )/(4 z +i ) ] = [7 z +4i )/(4 z +i )

Denominator:

[4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ] = [4i z +8 +i*(4 z +i ) ]/(4 z +i )

= [4i z +8 +4i z +i^2 ]/(4 z +i )

= [8i z +8 -1 ]/(4 z +i )

= (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i )

Therefore, f(f(z)) = [ (7 z +4i )/(4 z +i ) ] / [ (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i ) ] = (7 z +4i )/(8i z +7 )

This is not equal to z, so f is not an involution. Therefore, there&#x27;s no immediate symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation maps both axes to the same circle due to some symmetry. But my previous computations do not support this. The real axis maps to a circle, and the imaginary axis maps to a line. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in my solution.

Alternatively, maybe the question is to find the radius for each axis separately. For the real axis, we have radius 9/8. For the imaginary axis, since it&#x27;s mapped to a line, which can be thought of as a circle with infinite radius, but the problem asks for a finite radius. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 9/8.

Given the problem&#x27;s wording, and since the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line (infinite radius), but the problem mentions &quot;the circle&quot;, likely referring to the real axis&#x27;s image, which is a finite circle, the answer should be 9/8.

But to confirm, let&#x27;s see if any other references or methods can show that both images are the same circle.

Alternatively, suppose we consider the transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i )

Let me check if it maps the real axis to a circle and the imaginary axis to the same circle.

From previous calculations, the real axis maps to a circle with center (0, -7/8 ) and radius 9/8. The imaginary axis maps to the imaginary line, which intersects this circle at -2i and i/4. The points -2i and i/4 are both on the circle, as:

Distance from -2i (0, -2) to center (0, -7/8 ) is | -2 - (-7/8 ) | = |-9/8 | =9/8.

Distance from i/4 (0, 1/4 ) to center (0, -7/8 ) is |1/4 - (-7/8 ) | = |9/8 | =9/8.

But the rest of the imaginary axis is not on the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis is the line passing through -2i and i/4 and extending to infinity, which is the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is not the same as the image of the real axis, unless we consider the extended line as a circle, which has infinite radius.

Given that the problem asks for the radius of the circle, expecting a finite number, and given that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, I think the answer is 9/8.

Therefore, the radius is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the circle is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes, we analyze the images of these axes under the transformation.

### Image of the Real Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \) where \( t \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = t \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i}
   \]
3. **Separating Real and Imaginary Parts**:
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
   This gives the parametric equations:
   \[
   u(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1}, \quad v(t) = \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
4. **Finding the Circle**:
   - By eliminating the parameter \( t \), we find that the image lies on a circle.
   - The circle&#x27;s center is found to be \( (0, -\frac{7}{8}) \) and the radius is calculated as \( \frac{9}{8} \).

### Image of the Imaginary Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = is \) where \( s \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = is \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(is) = \frac{-s + 2}{i(4s + 1)}
   \]
3. **Simplifying**:
   - This results in purely imaginary numbers, indicating the image is a line (the imaginary axis in the complex plane).

### Conclusion
The real axis is mapped to a circle with radius \( \frac{9}{8} \). The imaginary axis is mapped to a line, which in the extended complex plane can be considered a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem specifies a finite radius, so we conclude the radius of the circle onto which the real axis is mapped is the answer.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the radius of the circle that the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes onto. Hmm, bilinear transformations, also known as Möbius transformations, right? They have some properties like mapping circles and lines to circles or lines. Since both the real and imaginary axes are lines in the complex plane, their images under this transformation should be either circles or lines. The problem says &quot;onto the circle,&quot; so I guess both axes are mapped to the same circle? Or maybe each axis is mapped to a circle, and we need to find their radii? Wait, the question says &quot;the circle,&quot; so maybe both are mapped to the same circle? Let me check the wording again: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So, both axes are mapped to the same circle, and we need to find its radius. Alright, that makes sense.

First, let me recall that a bilinear transformation is determined by its action on three points. Also, since it&#x27;s a transformation from the extended complex plane to itself, it can map lines to circles and vice versa. The real and imaginary axes are both lines through the origin, but perpendicular to each other. The transformation \( f(z) \) is given, so maybe I can find images of points on the real axis and the imaginary axis and see what circle they lie on.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the real axis and the imaginary axis, plug them into the transformation, and then find the equation of the image curve, which should be a circle, and then find its radius.

Let me try this approach.

First, let&#x27;s handle the real axis. The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \), where \( t \) is a real number. Then, substitute \( z = t \) into the transformation:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \).

Similarly, the imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = i s \), where \( s \) is a real number. Substituting \( z = i s \):

\( f(i s) = \frac{i (i s) + 2}{4 (i s) + i} = \frac{-s + 2}{4 i s + i} = \frac{(-s + 2)}{i (4 s + 1)} \).

Let me compute both images and see if they lie on the same circle.

Starting with the real axis:

\( f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i} \). Let me write this in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let me denote \( f(t) = u + iv \).

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize:

Denominator: \( 4 t + i \), conjugate is \( 4 t - i \).

So,

\( f(t) = \frac{(i t + 2)(4 t - i)}{(4 t + i)(4 t - i)} \).

Compute the denominator first:

\( (4 t)^2 - (i)^2 = 16 t^2 - (-1) = 16 t^2 + 1 \).

Numerator:

Expand \( (i t + 2)(4 t - i) \):

First term: \( i t \cdot 4 t = 4 i t^2 \)

Second term: \( i t \cdot (-i) = -i^2 t = -(-1) t = t \)

Third term: \( 2 \cdot 4 t = 8 t \)

Fourth term: \( 2 \cdot (-i) = -2 i \)

So combining all terms:

\( 4 i t^2 + t + 8 t - 2 i = 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \).

Therefore, the numerator is \( 4 i t^2 + 9 t - 2 i \), and the denominator is \( 16 t^2 + 1 \).

So, separating into real and imaginary parts:

Real part: \( 9 t / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Imaginary part: \( (4 t^2 - 2) / (16 t^2 + 1) \)

Therefore, \( f(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \).

So, parametrizing the image of the real axis as \( (u(t), v(t)) \), where:

\( u(t) = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

\( v(t) = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \)

Now, to find the equation of the circle that these points lie on, I can try to eliminate the parameter \( t \) from the equations for \( u \) and \( v \).

Let me set:

\( u = \frac{9 t}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (1)

\( v = \frac{4 t^2 - 2}{16 t^2 + 1} \) ... (2)

Let me solve equation (1) for \( t \):

From (1):

\( u (16 t^2 + 1) = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 + u = 9 t \)

\( 16 u t^2 - 9 t + u = 0 \)

This is a quadratic equation in \( t \), but maybe it&#x27;s messy to solve for \( t \). Alternatively, let me express \( t \) from equation (1) in terms of \( u \), but it&#x27;s a quadratic, so maybe another approach.

Alternatively, notice that from equation (2), we can express \( 16 t^2 + 1 \) as denominator, so let me denote \( D = 16 t^2 + 1 \). Then:

\( u = 9 t / D \)

\( v = (4 t^2 - 2)/D \)

Then, let&#x27;s compute \( u^2 + v^2 \):

\( u^2 + v^2 = (81 t^2 + (4 t^2 - 2)^2) / D^2 \)

Compute numerator:

\( 81 t^2 + (16 t^4 - 16 t^2 + 4) = 16 t^4 + (81 t^2 - 16 t^2) + 4 = 16 t^4 + 65 t^2 + 4 \)

But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, express \( t \) in terms of \( u \) and substitute into \( v \).

Alternatively, let&#x27;s consider that the image lies on a circle, so its equation can be written as \( (u - a)^2 + (v - b)^2 = r^2 \). We need to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( r \).

But since both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to the same circle, we might need to consider points from both images to determine the circle. Alternatively, maybe each axis maps to a circle, and both circles have the same radius? Wait, the problem states &quot;the circle&quot;, so perhaps both axes are mapped to the same circle. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the image of each axis is a circle, and we have to find the radius of each? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes,&quot; which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle, so their images coincide as a circle. Let me check with specific points.

First, check some points on the real axis and see where they are mapped.

Take z = 0 (on real axis): f(0) = (i*0 + 2)/(4*0 + i) = 2 / i = -2i.

Take z = ∞ (on extended real axis): The limit as t approaches ∞ of f(t) = (i t + 2)/(4 t + i) ≈ (i t)/(4 t) = i/4. So f(∞) = i/4.

Take z = 1: f(1) = (i + 2)/(4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (4 - i):

Numerator: (i + 2)(4 - i) = 4i - i^2 + 8 - 2i = (4i - 2i) + ( -i^2 +8 ) = 2i + 1 +8 = 2i +9

Denominator: (4 + i)(4 - i) = 16 - i^2 = 17

Thus, f(1) = (9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (9/17, 2/17)

Similarly, take z = -1: f(-1) = (-i + 2)/(-4 + i). Multiply numerator and denominator by (-4 - i):

Numerator: (-i + 2)(-4 - i) = (-i)(-4) + (-i)(-i) + 2*(-4) + 2*(-i) = 4i + i^2 -8 -2i = (4i - 2i) + (-1 -8) = 2i -9

Denominator: (-4 + i)(-4 -i) = 16 - (i)^2 = 17

Thus, f(-1) = (-9 + 2i)/17 ≈ (-9/17, 2/17)

So these points are on the image of the real axis. Similarly, the points when z approaches 0 and ∞ are -2i and i/4. So plotting these points: -2i, i/4, (9/17, 2/17), (-9/17, 2/17). Hmm, these points seem to lie on a circle. Let&#x27;s check if they lie on the same circle.

First, let&#x27;s check if points -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17) lie on a circle.

A circle in the complex plane can be represented as |w - c| = r, where c is the center and r is the radius.

Let me consider three points: -2i, i/4, and (9/17, 2/17).

First, represent these points in coordinates:

-2i is (0, -2)

i/4 is (0, 1/4)

(9/17, 2/17) is (9/17, 2/17)

So, three points: (0, -2), (0, 1/4), (9/17, 2/17)

We need to find the circle passing through these three points.

Let me denote the circle equation as \( (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Plugging in the three points:

1. For (0, -2):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (-2 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

2. For (0, 1/4):

\( (0 - a)^2 + (1/4 - b)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

3. For (9/17, 2/17):

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - b)^2 = r^2 \)

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

\( [a^2 + (b + 2)^2] - [a^2 + (b - 1/4)^2] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( (b + 2)^2 - (b - 1/4)^2 = 0 \)

Expand both squares:

\( [b^2 +4b +4] - [b^2 - (1/2)b + 1/16] = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( b^2 +4b +4 -b^2 + (1/2)b -1/16 = 0 \)

Combine like terms:

\( (4b + (1/2)b) + (4 - 1/16) = 0 \)

\( (9/2)b + (63/16) = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate denominators:

\( 72b + 63 = 0 \)

=&gt; 72b = -63 =&gt; b = -63/72 = -7/8

So, the y-coordinate of the center is -7/8.

Now, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 1:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 + 2)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 + 2 = -7/8 + 16/8 = 9/8

So,

\( a^2 + (9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Similarly, substitute b = -7/8 into equation 2:

\( a^2 + (-7/8 - 1/4)^2 = r^2 \)

Compute -7/8 - 2/8 = -9/8

Thus,

\( a^2 + (-9/8)^2 = r^2 \) =&gt; same as above, so no new information.

Now, use equation 3 with b = -7/8:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (2/17 - (-7/8))^2 = r^2 \)

First, compute 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16/136 + 119/136) = 135/136

So,

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = r^2 \)

We also have from equation 1: \( a^2 + 81/64 = r^2 \)

Set them equal:

\( (9/17 - a)^2 + (135/136)^2 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Expand the left side:

\( (81/289 - (18/17)a + a^2) + (18225/18496) = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Simplify:

\( a^2 - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = a^2 + 81/64 \)

Cancel \( a^2 \):

\( - (18/17)a + 81/289 + 18225/18496 = 81/64 \)

Multiply all terms by 18496 (which is 17^2 * 16^2) to eliminate denominators:

Let&#x27;s compute each term:

- (18/17)a * 18496 = -18 * 18496 /17 * a = -18*1088*a = -19584 a

81/289 *18496 = 81 * (18496 /289) = 81 * 64 = 5184

18225/18496 *18496 = 18225

81/64 *18496 = 81 * 18496 /64 = 81 * 289 = 23409

So the equation becomes:

-19584a + 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Compute 5184 + 18225 = 23409

Thus:

-19584a + 23409 = 23409

Subtract 23409:

-19584a = 0 =&gt; a = 0

Therefore, the center is at (0, -7/8) and radius squared is \( a^2 + 81/64 = 81/64 \), so radius is 9/8.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Wait, but let&#x27;s check if the point (9/17, 2/17) lies on this circle.

Center is (0, -7/8), radius 9/8.

Compute distance from (9/17, 2/17) to (0, -7/8):

Difference in x: 9/17 - 0 = 9/17

Difference in y: 2/17 - (-7/8) = 2/17 + 7/8 = (16 + 119)/136 = 135/136

Compute the distance squared:

(9/17)^2 + (135/136)^2

= 81/289 + 18225/18496

Convert to common denominator:

81/289 = (81 * 64)/ (289 * 64) = 5184/18496

18225/18496

Sum: 5184 + 18225 = 23409 /18496 = (153)^2 / (136)^2 = (153/136)^2

But 153 = 9*17, 136 = 8*17, so 153/136 = 9/8. Hence, distance squared is (9/8)^2, so distance is 9/8, which matches the radius. So, yes, the point is on the circle.

Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle with center at (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8.

Now, let&#x27;s check the image of the imaginary axis. Earlier, we parametrized z = i s, so:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } \)

Let me simplify this expression.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s + 1)(-i) } \)

Wait, denominator: i*(4s +1)*(-i) = -i^2*(4s +1) = (1)*(4s +1) = 4s +1.

Numerator: (-s + 2)(-i) = (s - 2)i

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \)

So, written as \( u + iv \), this is:

\( u = 0 \), \( v = \frac{ s - 2 }{ 4s +1 } \)

Wait, hold on: Wait, if \( f(i s) = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then the real part is 0 and the imaginary part is \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), right? Because multiplying by i gives a purely imaginary number.

Wait, but no: Let me check again. If we have \( \frac{ (s - 2)i }{4s +1 } \), then that&#x27;s equal to \( i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is a purely imaginary number. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points \( 0 + i \cdot \frac{ s - 2 }{4s +1 } \), which is the imaginary axis in the complex plane? But parametrized by s. Wait, but s is real, except when 4s +1 =0, i.e., s = -1/4, which would be a point at infinity.

But hold on, the image is a subset of the imaginary axis? But that can&#x27;t be, since the problem states that the transformation maps the axes to a circle. But according to this, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let&#x27;s recast the computation of f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis.

Given \( z = i s \), then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i} = \frac{ -s + 2 }{4i s + i } \)

Factor out i from the denominator:

\( \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1) } = \frac{ (-s + 2) }{i (4 s + 1)} \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

\( \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i (4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1) } \)

Because denominator: \( i*(-i) = -i^2 = 1 \), so denominator becomes \( (4 s +1) \)

So, numerator is \( (s - 2)i \), so \( f(z) = \frac{(s - 2)i}{4 s +1 } \)

Therefore, this is a purely imaginary number scaled by \( \frac{(s - 2)}{4 s +1 } \). So the image is the imaginary axis? But parametrized with a real parameter s. Wait, but except when 4 s +1 =0, which would be s = -1/4, but as s approaches -1/4, the image goes to infinity.

But the imaginary axis is a line, not a circle. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. But since bilinear transformations map circles and lines to circles or lines, the image of the imaginary axis under this transformation is either a line or a circle. But according to this computation, it&#x27;s the imaginary axis, which is a line. But the problem states that it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; So if the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line, then they can&#x27;t both be mapped to the same circle. But according to the problem statement, it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle onto which both axes are mapped. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my computation.

Wait, let&#x27;s re-examine the transformation. The transformation is \( f(z) = \frac{ i z + 2 }{4 z + i } \). Let me check if it&#x27;s invertible. The determinant of the coefficients matrix is (i)(i) - (2)(4) = (-1) - 8 = -9 ≠ 0, so it&#x27;s invertible.

Wait, when I computed the image of the imaginary axis, I substituted z = i s and found that f(z) is purely imaginary. But that would imply the image is the imaginary axis, but that contradicts the problem&#x27;s statement. Hmm. So perhaps my error is in the calculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s recompute the image of z = i s:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ i*(i s) + 2 }{4*(i s) + i } \)

Compute numerator: \( i^2 s + 2 = -s + 2 \)

Denominator: \( 4i s + i = i(4 s +1 ) \)

Therefore, \( f(i s) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i(4 s + 1) } \)

To express this in terms of real and imaginary parts, we can multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(i s) = \frac{ (-s + 2)(-i) }{ i(4 s +1)(-i) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ (4 s +1 ) } \)

Since the denominator was multiplied by -i, which is the conjugate of i, to make it real.

Thus, the result is \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s +1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). So, as s varies over real numbers (excluding s = -1/4), the image is all purely imaginary numbers except when s approaches -1/4, which would approach infinity.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under f(z) is the imaginary axis in the w-plane, plus the point at infinity. But in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem states that both the real and imaginary axes are mapped to a circle. But according to the computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8 and center at (0, -7/8), while the imaginary axis is mapped to the imaginary line (which is a circle through infinity). Therefore, there must be an error here.

But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;. Maybe the problem is that in the finite plane, the image of the imaginary axis is a line, but perhaps when considering the extended complex plane, the line together with the point at infinity forms a circle. However, in that case, the radius would be infinite, which doesn&#x27;t make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I have a miscalculation.

Wait, let&#x27;s check with specific points on the imaginary axis.

Take z = 0 (on imaginary axis? Wait, z=0 is on both axes, but in the parametrization z = i s, when s = 0, we get z=0. Then f(0) = 2/i = -2i, which is the same as before.

Take z = i (s=1): f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

Take z = 2i (s=2): f(2i) = (i*2i + 2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 + 2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) = 0.

Take z = i/2 (s=1/2): f(i/2) = (i*(i/2) +2)/(4*(i/2) +i) = (-1/2 + 2)/(2i +i) = (3/2)/(3i) = (3/2)/(3i) = 1/(2i) = -i/2.

Take z approaching infinity along the imaginary axis: s approaches infinity, so f(z) = ( -s + 2 ) / (4i s +i ) ≈ -s / 4i s = -1/(4i) = i/4.

So the images are: -2i, -i/5, 0, -i/2, and i/4. These points are all on the imaginary axis. So when s approaches infinity, f(z) approaches i/4, which is a finite point. When s approaches -1/4, the denominator 4s +1 approaches zero, so f(z) approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which in the extended complex plane is a circle. But in the standard complex plane, it&#x27;s a line. However, since Möbius transformations map lines to circles or lines, depending on whether they pass through the pole of the transformation.

But in our case, the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is not on the imaginary axis (since the imaginary axis is z = iy, and -i/4 is on the imaginary axis). Wait, z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis. Wait, the denominator 4z +i =0 when z = -i/4. Therefore, the point z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, and thus the transformation has a pole there. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation should be a circle, because the pole is on the original axis, so the image is a circle.

But according to the previous computation, the image seems to be the entire imaginary axis. But that contradicts. Wait, perhaps there&#x27;s a mistake here.

Wait, if the transformation has a pole at z = -i/4, which is on the imaginary axis, then the image of the imaginary axis should be a circle in the extended complex plane. However, when we parameterized it, we obtained the entire imaginary axis except for the point at s = -1/4, which maps to infinity. Therefore, in the extended complex plane, the image is the imaginary axis plus the point at infinity, which is a &quot;circle&quot; passing through infinity, i.e., a line. But according to Möbius transformation properties, if the original line passes through the pole, then the image is a line; otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle. Wait, maybe that&#x27;s the key.

Wait, the general property is that Möbius transformations map circles and lines to circles and lines. A line can be considered a circle passing through infinity. If the original line passes through the pole of the transformation (the point where the denominator is zero), then the image will pass through infinity, hence it&#x27;s a line. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a circle.

In our case, the real axis does not pass through the pole z = -i/4, since the pole is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the real axis is a circle. The imaginary axis does pass through the pole z = -i/4, so its image is a line (the extended line, i.e., a circle passing through infinity).

But the problem states that the transformation maps both the real and imaginary axes onto the same circle. There&#x27;s a contradiction here. Therefore, either the problem is ill-posed, or my computations are wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the image of each axis separately, and both images are circles, but with the same radius? Let me check again.

Wait, let&#x27;s compute the image of the imaginary axis again more carefully.

Parametrizing z = i s, then:

\( f(z) = \frac{ -s + 2 }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (2 - s) }{ i (4 s + 1 ) } \)

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

\( f(z) = \frac{ (2 - s)(-i) }{ (4 s + 1 ) } = \frac{ (s - 2)i }{ 4 s + 1 } \)

Thus, this is equal to \( \frac{ (s - 2) }{4 s + 1 } i \), which is a purely imaginary number with imaginary part \( \frac{ s - 2 }{4 s +1 } \). Therefore, as s varies over ℝ \ { -1/4 }, the image is all imaginary numbers. However, when s approaches -1/4, the denominator approaches zero, so the image approaches infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the extended imaginary axis (including infinity), which is a line in the extended complex plane. But the problem says it&#x27;s mapped onto a circle, which suggests a finite circle.

But according to my previous calculation, the image of the real axis is a circle with radius 9/8. However, the problem mentions &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which might mean that both axes are mapped to the same circle. But according to my computations, the real axis is mapped to a circle, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misstated, or I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check another point on the imaginary axis. Take z = -i/4, which is the pole. But z = -i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so it&#x27;s mapped to infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line plus infinity, which is a line in the extended plane. So that can&#x27;t be a circle. However, the problem says &quot;onto the circle&quot;, so maybe the question is actually only referring to the real axis? Or maybe the problem is in error.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation when considering the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s consider another approach. Let&#x27;s suppose that both images are circles. Wait, but we saw that the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line. However, maybe in the extended plane, the line is considered a circle, but the problem is asking for the radius in the standard plane, so only the real axis&#x27;s image is a circle with finite radius, and the imaginary axis&#x27;s image is a line, which has infinite radius. But the problem says &quot;the circle&quot;, so maybe the answer is 9/8, the radius from the real axis image.

But the problem states: &quot;Determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes.&quot; If both axes are mapped to the same circle, but our calculation shows that the real axis is mapped to a circle and the imaginary axis to a line, there&#x27;s a problem. Alternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation in the image of the imaginary axis.

Wait, let&#x27;s try parametrizing the image of the imaginary axis again. Suppose I write w = f(z) when z is on the imaginary axis, so z = iy, y ∈ ℝ.

Then, w = (i*(iy) + 2)/(4*(iy) + i) = (-y + 2)/(4iy + i) = (2 - y)/(i(4y +1)).

Let me write w = u + iv.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to make the denominator real:

w = (2 - y)(-i)/(i(4y +1)(-i)) = (-i(2 - y))/( (4y +1) )

The denominator simplifies to (4y +1) because i*(-i) = 1.

Therefore, w = -i(2 - y)/(4y +1 ) = [ (y - 2)/(4y +1) ] i.

So, w is purely imaginary, with v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ), and u = 0.

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v = (y - 2)/(4y +1 ) for real y ≠ -1/4.

To see if this is a circle, we can parametrize v in terms of y:

Let me set t = y, then v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

This is a hyperbola or a straight line?

Wait, solving for t:

v = (t - 2)/(4t +1 )

Multiply both sides by (4t +1):

v(4t +1 ) = t -2

4v t + v = t -2

4v t - t = -2 - v

t(4v -1 ) = - (2 + v )

Therefore,

t = - (2 + v ) / (4v -1 )

This shows that for each v ≠ 1/4, there&#x27;s a corresponding t. But this parametrization covers all real numbers except v = 1/4, which would require the denominator 4v -1 =0, i.e., v=1/4. When v approaches 1/4, t approaches infinity.

But the image is the set of all points (0, v) where v can be any real number except v=1/4. Wait, but in reality, when t approaches infinity, v = (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t/(4t ) = 1/4. So, as t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4 from below. Similarly, when t approaches -1/4 from the right, denominator approaches zero, and v approaches ± infinity depending on the direction.

Wait, let&#x27;s analyze the function v(t) = (t -2)/(4t +1 )

Find the range of v(t):

As t approaches infinity, v approaches 1/4.

As t approaches -1/4 from above, denominator approaches 0+, numerator approaches (-1/4 - 2 )= -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0+ = -infty.

As t approaches -1/4 from below, denominator approaches 0-, numerator approaches -9/4, so v approaches -9/4 /0- = +infty.

At t = 2, v=0.

Therefore, the function v(t) maps:

t ∈ (-∞, -1/4 ) to v ∈ (1/4, +infty ) (wait, hold on):

Wait, let&#x27;s check:

For t &lt; -1/4:

Denominator 4t +1 &lt; 0.

Numerator t -2: If t approaches -infty, t -2 approaches -infty.

So for t &lt; -1/4:

v = (negative)/(negative) = positive.

As t approaches -infty, v ≈ t /4t = 1/4. So from above.

Wait, as t approaches -infty, (t -2)/(4t +1 ) ≈ t /4t = 1/4, approaching 1/4 from above? Wait:

Let me compute the limit as t approaches -infty:

(t -2)/(4t +1 ) = [ t (1 - 2/t ) ] / [ t (4 + 1/t ) ] = (1 - 0)/(4 +0 ) = 1/4. So as t approaches -infty, v approaches 1/4 from above (since numerator is negative and denominator is negative, making positive, and when t approaches -infty, the difference from 1/4 is positive). Wait, not sure. Let me plug in t = -N where N is a large positive number:

v = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (-N -2)/(-4N +1 ) = (N +2)/(4N -1 ) ≈ N /4N = 1/4. So approaching 1/4 from above? Let&#x27;s compute for large N:

(N +2)/(4N -1 ) = [N(1 + 2/N )]/[N(4 -1/N ) ] = (1 + 2/N )/(4 -1/N ) ≈ (1 +0 )/(4 -0 ) = 1/4. So as N increases, the value approaches 1/4 from slightly above? Let&#x27;s take N=1000:

(1000 +2 )/(4000 -1 ) = 1002/3999 ≈ 0.2506, which is slightly more than 1/4. So yes, approaches 1/4 from above.

Similarly, for t approaching -1/4 from the left (t approaching -1/4- ):

t approaching -1/4 from below (t = -1/4 - ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 - ε -2 ) = -9/4 - ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 - ε ) +1 = -1 -4ε +1 = -4ε

So v = (-9/4 - ε )/(-4ε ) = (9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (9/4)/4ε = 9/(16ε ), which approaches +infty as ε→0+.

For t approaching -1/4 from the right (t = -1/4 + ε, ε→0+ ):

Numerator: (-1/4 + ε -2 ) = -9/4 + ε

Denominator: 4*(-1/4 + ε ) +1 = -1 +4ε +1 = 4ε

v = (-9/4 + ε )/(4ε ) ≈ (-9/4)/4ε = -9/(16ε ), which approaches -infty as ε→0+.

At t = 2: v=0.

Therefore, the range of v(t) is:

- When t ∈ (-infty, -1/4 ), v ∈ (1/4, +infty )

- When t ∈ (-1/4, ∞ ), v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 )

Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the set of points (0, v) where v ∈ (-infty, 1/4 ) ∪ (1/4, +infty ), i.e., the entire imaginary axis except the point v=1/4. But in the extended complex plane, we include infinity, so the image is the entire imaginary axis (as a line), which makes sense because the pole at z=-i/4 is on the imaginary axis, so the image is a line.

But according to the problem statement, we should map both axes to a circle. This suggests a discrepancy. However, earlier computation showed that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line. Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I misinterpreted it. Maybe it&#x27;s asking for the radius of the circle that the real axis is mapped to, and separately the radius for the imaginary axis? But the problem says &quot;the circle onto which the bilinear transformation maps the real and imaginary axes&quot;, which seems to imply a single circle. But according to my calculations, they are mapped to different circles (one a finite circle, one a line). This is confusing.

Wait, maybe there&#x27;s a mistake in the computation for the image of the imaginary axis. Let me try a different approach. Instead of parametrizing z = i s, perhaps I should consider the image of the imaginary axis under the transformation f(z) and see if it can be represented as a circle.

The general method for finding the image of a line under a Möbius transformation is to take three points on the original line, find their images, and then determine the circle or line through those points.

Let&#x27;s apply this method to the imaginary axis.

Take three points on the imaginary axis:

1. z = 0: f(0) = 2/i = -2i.

2. z = i: f(i) = (i*i + 2)/(4*i + i) = (-1 + 2)/(5i) = 1/(5i) = -i/5.

3. z = ∞: The transformation as z approaches ∞ along the imaginary axis: f(z) = (i*z + 2)/(4*z + i) ≈ (i*z)/(4*z) = i/4.

So the three image points are -2i, -i/5, and i/4.

These three points are on the imaginary axis. To determine if they lie on a circle, note that three colinear points (on the same line) lie on an infinite number of circles, but in the standard plane, the only circle that includes them is the line itself, considered as a circle with infinite radius. However, in the extended complex plane, a line is a circle passing through infinity. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary line, which is a &quot;circle&quot; with infinite radius. But the problem asks for the radius of the circle, which is finite. Therefore, this suggests that only the real axis is mapped to a circle with finite radius, and the answer should be 9/8.

However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the circle, which contradicts our findings. Therefore, perhaps there&#x27;s an error in the problem or in my solution.

Wait, let&#x27;s cross-verify the image of the real axis. We found that it&#x27;s a circle with center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. Let me check if the images of the real axis include points from the imaginary axis&#x27;s image. For example, take z =0 (on both axes), maps to -2i, which is on the circle (distance from center (0, -7/8) to -2i (0, -2) is | -2 - (-7/8)| = |-16/8 +7/8| = |-9/8| = 9/8, which is the radius. So yes, -2i is on the circle. The point at infinity maps to i/4, which is also on the circle: center (0, -7/8), distance to i/4 (0, 1/4) is |1/4 - (-7/8)| = |1/4 +7/8| = |9/8| =9/8, which is the radius. The images of the real axis include points like i/4 and -2i, which are also images of points on the imaginary axis. Wait, hold on. The image of the real axis includes the point -2i (image of z=0) and i/4 (image of z=∞), which are also images of points on the imaginary axis (z=0 and z=∞). Similarly, images of the imaginary axis include -2i, which is also on the real axis&#x27;s image. Wait, but the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, but the circle we found for the real axis&#x27;s image includes some points on the imaginary axis. Specifically, the circle intersects the imaginary axis at -2i and i/4. But the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary axis, which includes these two points. Therefore, perhaps the problem is referring to the circle that is the image of the real axis, and the image of the imaginary axis is the line that coincides with the imaginary axis, intersecting the circle at -2i and i/4. However, the problem states both axes are mapped to the same circle. Since the image of the real axis is a circle, and the image of the imaginary axis is a line intersecting that circle at two points, but not the entire circle. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my previous reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the image of the imaginary axis is the entire imaginary line. Let me check with another point.

Take z = 2i (s=2). Then f(2i) = (i*2i +2)/(4*2i +i) = (-2 +2)/(9i) = 0/(9i) =0, which is on the real axis&#x27;s image circle? Let&#x27;s check. The circle has center (0, -7/8) and radius 9/8. The point 0 is at (0,0). The distance from (0,0) to (0, -7/8) is 7/8, which is less than 9/8, so 0 is inside the circle. Wait, but 0 is the image of z=2i, which is on the imaginary axis. Therefore, 0 is inside the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis includes points inside the circle. But the image of the real axis is the circle itself. So the image of the imaginary axis is the imaginary axis, which intersects the circle at -2i and i/4, and passes through 0 inside the circle. Therefore, the two images are different: one is a circle, the other is a line intersecting the circle. So the problem statement must be incorrect, or I have a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem is to find the radius of the circle that both axes are mapped to, implying that both images coincide. In that case, my previous calculation must be wrong.

Wait, let&#x27;s see. The transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let me check if it&#x27;s an involution or has some symmetry. Let me compute f(f(z)):

Compute f(f(z)):

First, f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i). Let&#x27;s substitute w = f(z):

f(w) = (i w +2 )/(4 w +i )

Substitute w = (i z +2)/(4 z +i ):

= [ i*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +2 ] / [4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ]

Simplify numerator:

[ (i^2 z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2 ] = [ (-z + 2i )/(4 z +i ) + 2*(4 z +i )/(4 z +i ) ]

= [ (-z + 2i +8 z +2i )/(4 z +i ) ] = [7 z +4i )/(4 z +i )

Denominator:

[4*(i z +2 )/(4 z +i ) +i ] = [4i z +8 +i*(4 z +i ) ]/(4 z +i )

= [4i z +8 +4i z +i^2 ]/(4 z +i )

= [8i z +8 -1 ]/(4 z +i )

= (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i )

Therefore, f(f(z)) = [ (7 z +4i )/(4 z +i ) ] / [ (8i z +7 )/(4 z +i ) ] = (7 z +4i )/(8i z +7 )

This is not equal to z, so f is not an involution. Therefore, there&#x27;s no immediate symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation maps both axes to the same circle due to some symmetry. But my previous computations do not support this. The real axis maps to a circle, and the imaginary axis maps to a line. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in my solution.

Alternatively, maybe the question is to find the radius for each axis separately. For the real axis, we have radius 9/8. For the imaginary axis, since it&#x27;s mapped to a line, which can be thought of as a circle with infinite radius, but the problem asks for a finite radius. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 9/8.

Given the problem&#x27;s wording, and since the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, and the imaginary axis is mapped to a line (infinite radius), but the problem mentions &quot;the circle&quot;, likely referring to the real axis&#x27;s image, which is a finite circle, the answer should be 9/8.

But to confirm, let&#x27;s see if any other references or methods can show that both images are the same circle.

Alternatively, suppose we consider the transformation f(z) = (i z +2)/(4 z +i )

Let me check if it maps the real axis to a circle and the imaginary axis to the same circle.

From previous calculations, the real axis maps to a circle with center (0, -7/8 ) and radius 9/8. The imaginary axis maps to the imaginary line, which intersects this circle at -2i and i/4. The points -2i and i/4 are both on the circle, as:

Distance from -2i (0, -2) to center (0, -7/8 ) is | -2 - (-7/8 ) | = |-9/8 | =9/8.

Distance from i/4 (0, 1/4 ) to center (0, -7/8 ) is |1/4 - (-7/8 ) | = |9/8 | =9/8.

But the rest of the imaginary axis is not on the circle, so the image of the imaginary axis is the line passing through -2i and i/4 and extending to infinity, which is the imaginary axis. Therefore, the image of the imaginary axis is not the same as the image of the real axis, unless we consider the extended line as a circle, which has infinite radius.

Given that the problem asks for the radius of the circle, expecting a finite number, and given that the real axis is mapped to a circle with radius 9/8, I think the answer is 9/8.

Therefore, the radius is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the circle is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the radius of the circle onto which the bilinear transformation \( f(z) = \frac{i z + 2}{4z + i} \) maps the real and imaginary axes, we analyze the images of these axes under the transformation.

### Image of the Real Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The real axis can be parametrized as \( z = t \) where \( t \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = t \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{i t + 2}{4 t + i}
   \]
3. **Separating Real and Imaginary Parts**:
   \[
   f(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1} + i \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
   This gives the parametric equations:
   \[
   u(t) = \frac{9t}{16t^2 + 1}, \quad v(t) = \frac{4t^2 - 2}{16t^2 + 1}
   \]
4. **Finding the Circle**:
   - By eliminating the parameter \( t \), we find that the image lies on a circle.
   - The circle&#x27;s center is found to be \( (0, -\frac{7}{8}) \) and the radius is calculated as \( \frac{9}{8} \).

### Image of the Imaginary Axis
1. **Parametrization**: The imaginary axis can be parametrized as \( z = is \) where \( s \) is a real number.
2. **Transformation**: Substituting \( z = is \) into \( f(z) \):
   \[
   f(is) = \frac{-s + 2}{i(4s + 1)}
   \]
3. **Simplifying**:
   - This results in purely imaginary numbers, indicating the image is a line (the imaginary axis in the complex plane).

### Conclusion
The real axis is mapped to a circle with radius \( \frac{9}{8} \). The imaginary axis is mapped to a line, which in the extended complex plane can be considered a circle passing through infinity. However, the problem specifies a finite radius, so we conclude the radius of the circle onto which the real axis is mapped is the answer.

\boxed{\dfrac{9}{8}}
