Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s tackle this interval of convergence problem for the series \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k!(x-2)^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, okay. So, interval of convergence usually involves using the Ratio Test or the Root Test. Since this series has factorials and exponentials, maybe the Ratio Test is the way to go? Let me recall that the Ratio Test involves taking the limit of the absolute value of a_{k+1}/a_k as k approaches infinity, and then seeing if that limit is less than 1 for convergence.

First, let me write out the general term of the series: \( a_k = \frac{k!(x - 2)^k}{k^k} \). So, to apply the Ratio Test, I need to compute \( L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right| \).

Let&#x27;s compute that step by step. The ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \) would be:

\( \frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \div \frac{k! (x - 2)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplifying this, the division becomes multiplication by the reciprocal:

\( \frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} \)

Now, let&#x27;s cancel out terms. The (k+1)! divided by k! is just (k+1). Similarly, (x - 2)^{k+1} divided by (x - 2)^k is (x - 2). Then, we have k^k divided by (k+1)^{k+1}.

So putting it all together:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \)

Simplify the exponents in the denominator: (k+1)^{k+1} = (k+1)^k \times (k+1). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k \times (k+1)} \)

The (k+1) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:

\( (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k} \)

Which can be written as:

\( (x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \)

Now, let&#x27;s compute the limit as k approaches infinity of that expression. The term \( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \) is a familiar limit. Let me recall that \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Wait, that&#x27;s similar to the limit definition of 1/e. Let&#x27;s see:

\( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Let me make a substitution: let n = k + 1, so as k approaches infinity, n approaches infinity as well. Then, the expression becomes \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n - 1} = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \times \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \). As n approaches infinity, \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \) approaches 1/e, and \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \) approaches 1. Therefore, the entire limit is 1/e. So, the limit \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \).

Therefore, the limit L from the Ratio Test is:

\( L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e} \)

For convergence, we need L &lt; 1:

\( \frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e \)

So, the radius of convergence is e, and the interval is centered at x = 2 with radius e. So, the interval is (2 - e, 2 + e). But we need to check the endpoints, x = 2 - e and x = 2 + e, to see if the series converges there.

First, let&#x27;s check x = 2 + e. Substitute x = 2 + e into the original series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (e)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplify the term: \( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, is this convergent?

Perhaps we can use Stirling&#x27;s approximation for k!, which is \( k! \approx k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Let&#x27;s substitute that into the term:

\( \frac{k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \times e^k}{k^k} = \sqrt{2\pi k} \)

So, the general term behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which goes to infinity as k approaches infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms is not zero; hence, the series diverges at x = 2 + e.

Now, check x = 2 - e. Substitute x = 2 - e into the series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \)

So, the terms are \( \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \), which is \( (-1)^k \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Similar to the previous case, using Stirling&#x27;s approximation:

\( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \approx \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Therefore, the general term is \( (-1)^k \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which alternates but the absolute value still tends to infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms does not approach zero, so by the Divergence Test, the series diverges at x = 2 - e as well.

Therefore, both endpoints diverge, so the interval of convergence is entirely open: (2 - e, 2 + e).

Wait a second, but let me verify once again the endpoint substitution. For x = 2 + e, we have (x - 2) = e, so the term becomes e^k. So, the term is k! e^k /k^k. Using Stirling&#x27;s formula:

k! ~ sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k. So, substituting:

sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k * e^k /k^k = sqrt(2 pi k). So, yes, the terms go to infinity, so divergence.

Similarly, at x = 2 - e, the terms are (-e)^k * k! /k^k, which alternates in sign but magnitude is the same as before, sqrt(2 pi k), so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero. Hence, divergence at both endpoints.

Therefore, the interval of convergence is indeed (2 - e, 2 + e), excluding the endpoints.

But wait, just to make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in the Ratio Test computation. Let me go through it again.

Starting with a_k = k! (x - 2)^k /k^k.

Compute a_{k+1}/a_k:

[(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1} / (k+1)^{k+1}] / [k! (x - 2)^k /k^k]

= (k+1)(x - 2) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * (k+1) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * k^k / (k+1)^k

= (x - 2) * [k/(k+1)]^k

Then, the limit as k-&gt;infty [k/(k+1)]^k = 1/e.

Therefore, L = |x - 2| / e. So, convergence when |x - 2| &lt; e, so radius e, center at 2. Then, endpoints checked, both diverge. So yes, the interval is open.

Therefore, the final answer is (2 - e, 2 + e). In boxed form, that&#x27;s \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.

**Final Answer**
The interval of convergence is \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the interval of convergence for the series \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k!(x-2)^k}{k^k} \), we use the Ratio Test. 

First, we consider the general term \( a_k = \frac{k!(x - 2)^k}{k^k} \). Applying the Ratio Test, we compute the limit:

\[
L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right|
\]

Simplifying the ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \):

\[
\frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} = (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}}
\]

This simplifies further to:

\[
(x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k
\]

Taking the limit as \( k \to \infty \), we use the known result \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \). Thus, the limit \( L \) becomes:

\[
L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e}
\]

For convergence, we need \( L &lt; 1 \):

\[
\frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e
\]

This gives the radius of convergence as \( e \), centered at \( x = 2 \). The interval is \( (2 - e, 2 + e) \).

Next, we check the endpoints \( x = 2 \pm e \):

- For \( x = 2 + e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Using Stirling&#x27;s approximation, the terms behave like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which diverges.
- For \( x = 2 - e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \). The terms alternate but their magnitude still behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which also diverges.

Thus, both endpoints diverge, confirming the interval of convergence is:

\[
\boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}

Simplifying this, the division becomes multiplication by the reciprocal:

\( \frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} \)

Now, let&#x27;s cancel out terms. The (k+1)! divided by k! is just (k+1). Similarly, (x - 2)^{k+1} divided by (x - 2)^k is (x - 2). Then, we have k^k divided by (k+1)^{k+1}.

So putting it all together:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \)

Simplify the exponents in the denominator: (k+1)^{k+1} = (k+1)^k \times (k+1). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k \times (k+1)} \)

The (k+1) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:

\( (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k} \)

Which can be written as:

\( (x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \)

Now, let&#x27;s compute the limit as k approaches infinity of that expression. The term \( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \) is a familiar limit.

\( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Let me make a substitution: let n = k + 1, so as k approaches infinity, n approaches infinity as well. Then, the expression becomes \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n - 1} = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \times \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \). As n approaches infinity, \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \) approaches 1/e, and \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \) approaches 1. Therefore, the entire limit is 1/e. So, the limit \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \).

Therefore, the limit L from the Ratio Test is:

\( L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e} \)

For convergence, we need L &lt; 1:

\( \frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e \)

So, the radius of convergence is e, and the interval is centered at x = 2 with radius e. So, the interval is (2 - e, 2 + e). But we need to check the endpoints, x = 2 - e and x = 2 + e, to see if the series converges there.

First, let&#x27;s check x = 2 + e. Substitute x = 2 + e into the original series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (e)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplify the term: \( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, is this convergent?

Perhaps we can use Stirling&#x27;s approximation for k!, which is \( k! \approx k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Let&#x27;s substitute that into the term:

\( \frac{k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \times e^k}{k^k} = \sqrt{2\pi k} \)

So, the general term behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which goes to infinity as k approaches infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms is not zero; hence, the series diverges at x = 2 + e.

Now, check x = 2 - e. Substitute x = 2 - e into the series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \)

So, the terms are \( \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \), which is \( (-1)^k \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Similar to the previous case, using Stirling&#x27;s approximation:

\( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \approx \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Therefore, the general term is \( (-1)^k \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which alternates but the absolute value still tends to infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms does not approach zero, so by the Divergence Test, the series diverges at x = 2 - e as well.

Wait a second, but let me verify once again the endpoint substitution. For x = 2 + e, we have (x - 2) = e, so the term becomes e^k. So, the term is k! e^k /k^k. Using Stirling&#x27;s formula:

k! ~ sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k. So, substituting:

sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k * e^k /k^k = sqrt(2 pi k). So, yes, the terms go to infinity, so divergence.

Similarly, at x = 2 - e, the terms are (-e)^k * k! /k^k, which alternates in sign but magnitude is the same as before, sqrt(2 pi k), so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero. Hence, divergence at both endpoints.

Therefore, the interval of convergence is indeed (2 - e, 2 + e), excluding the endpoints.

But wait, just to make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in the Ratio Test computation. Let me go through it again.

Starting with a_k = k! (x - 2)^k /k^k.

Compute a_{k+1}/a_k:

[(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1} / (k+1)^{k+1}] / [k! (x - 2)^k /k^k]

= (k+1)(x - 2) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * (k+1) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * k^k / (k+1)^k

= (x - 2) * [k/(k+1)]^k

Then, the limit as k-&gt;infty [k/(k+1)]^k = 1/e.

Therefore, L = |x - 2| / e. So, convergence when |x - 2| &lt; e, so radius e, center at 2. Then, endpoints checked, both diverge. So yes, the interval is open.

Therefore, the final answer is (2 - e, 2 + e). In boxed form, that&#x27;s \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.

**Final Answer**
The interval of convergence is \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.
&lt;/think&gt;

First, we consider the general term \( a_k = \frac{k!(x - 2)^k}{k^k} \). Applying the Ratio Test, we compute the limit:

\[
L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right|
\]

Simplifying the ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \):

\[
\frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} = (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}}
\]

This simplifies further to:

\[
(x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k
\]

Taking the limit as \( k \to \infty \), we use the known result \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \). Thus, the limit \( L \) becomes:

\[
L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e}
\]

For convergence, we need \( L &lt; 1 \):

\[
\frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e
\]

This gives the radius of convergence as \( e \), centered at \( x = 2 \). The interval is \( (2 - e, 2 + e) \).

Next, we check the endpoints \( x = 2 \pm e \):

- For \( x = 2 + e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Using Stirling&#x27;s approximation, the terms behave like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which diverges.
- For \( x = 2 - e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \). The terms alternate but their magnitude still behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which also diverges.

Thus, both endpoints diverge, confirming the interval of convergence is:

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s tackle this interval of convergence problem for the series \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k!(x-2)^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, okay. So, interval of convergence usually involves using the Ratio Test or the Root Test. Since this series has factorials and exponentials, maybe the Ratio Test is the way to go? Let me recall that the Ratio Test involves taking the limit of the absolute value of a_{k+1}/a_k as k approaches infinity, and then seeing if that limit is less than 1 for convergence.

First, let me write out the general term of the series: \( a_k = \frac{k!(x - 2)^k}{k^k} \). So, to apply the Ratio Test, I need to compute \( L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right| \).

Let&#x27;s compute that step by step. The ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \) would be:

\( \frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \div \frac{k! (x - 2)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplifying this, the division becomes multiplication by the reciprocal:

\( \frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} \)

Now, let&#x27;s cancel out terms. The (k+1)! divided by k! is just (k+1). Similarly, (x - 2)^{k+1} divided by (x - 2)^k is (x - 2). Then, we have k^k divided by (k+1)^{k+1}.

So putting it all together:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \)

Simplify the exponents in the denominator: (k+1)^{k+1} = (k+1)^k \times (k+1). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k \times (k+1)} \)

The (k+1) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:

\( (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k} \)

Which can be written as:

\( (x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \)

Now, let&#x27;s compute the limit as k approaches infinity of that expression. The term \( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \) is a familiar limit. Let me recall that \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Wait, that&#x27;s similar to the limit definition of 1/e. Let&#x27;s see:

\( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Let me make a substitution: let n = k + 1, so as k approaches infinity, n approaches infinity as well. Then, the expression becomes \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n - 1} = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \times \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \). As n approaches infinity, \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \) approaches 1/e, and \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \) approaches 1. Therefore, the entire limit is 1/e. So, the limit \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \).

Therefore, the limit L from the Ratio Test is:

\( L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e} \)

For convergence, we need L &lt; 1:

\( \frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e \)

So, the radius of convergence is e, and the interval is centered at x = 2 with radius e. So, the interval is (2 - e, 2 + e). But we need to check the endpoints, x = 2 - e and x = 2 + e, to see if the series converges there.

First, let&#x27;s check x = 2 + e. Substitute x = 2 + e into the original series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (e)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplify the term: \( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, is this convergent?

Perhaps we can use Stirling&#x27;s approximation for k!, which is \( k! \approx k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Let&#x27;s substitute that into the term:

\( \frac{k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \times e^k}{k^k} = \sqrt{2\pi k} \)

So, the general term behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which goes to infinity as k approaches infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms is not zero; hence, the series diverges at x = 2 + e.

Now, check x = 2 - e. Substitute x = 2 - e into the series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \)

So, the terms are \( \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \), which is \( (-1)^k \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Similar to the previous case, using Stirling&#x27;s approximation:

\( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \approx \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Therefore, the general term is \( (-1)^k \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which alternates but the absolute value still tends to infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms does not approach zero, so by the Divergence Test, the series diverges at x = 2 - e as well.

Therefore, both endpoints diverge, so the interval of convergence is entirely open: (2 - e, 2 + e).

Wait a second, but let me verify once again the endpoint substitution. For x = 2 + e, we have (x - 2) = e, so the term becomes e^k. So, the term is k! e^k /k^k. Using Stirling&#x27;s formula:

k! ~ sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k. So, substituting:

sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k * e^k /k^k = sqrt(2 pi k). So, yes, the terms go to infinity, so divergence.

Similarly, at x = 2 - e, the terms are (-e)^k * k! /k^k, which alternates in sign but magnitude is the same as before, sqrt(2 pi k), so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero. Hence, divergence at both endpoints.

Therefore, the interval of convergence is indeed (2 - e, 2 + e), excluding the endpoints.

But wait, just to make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in the Ratio Test computation. Let me go through it again.

Starting with a_k = k! (x - 2)^k /k^k.

Compute a_{k+1}/a_k:

[(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1} / (k+1)^{k+1}] / [k! (x - 2)^k /k^k]

= (k+1)(x - 2) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * (k+1) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * k^k / (k+1)^k

= (x - 2) * [k/(k+1)]^k

Then, the limit as k-&gt;infty [k/(k+1)]^k = 1/e.

Therefore, L = |x - 2| / e. So, convergence when |x - 2| &lt; e, so radius e, center at 2. Then, endpoints checked, both diverge. So yes, the interval is open.

Therefore, the final answer is (2 - e, 2 + e). In boxed form, that&#x27;s \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.

**Final Answer**
The interval of convergence is \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the interval of convergence for the series \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k!(x-2)^k}{k^k} \), we use the Ratio Test. 

First, we consider the general term \( a_k = \frac{k!(x - 2)^k}{k^k} \). Applying the Ratio Test, we compute the limit:

\[
L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right|
\]

Simplifying the ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \):

\[
\frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} = (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}}
\]

This simplifies further to:

\[
(x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k
\]

Taking the limit as \( k \to \infty \), we use the known result \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \). Thus, the limit \( L \) becomes:

\[
L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e}
\]

For convergence, we need \( L &lt; 1 \):

\[
\frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e
\]

This gives the radius of convergence as \( e \), centered at \( x = 2 \). The interval is \( (2 - e, 2 + e) \).

Next, we check the endpoints \( x = 2 \pm e \):

- For \( x = 2 + e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Using Stirling&#x27;s approximation, the terms behave like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which diverges.
- For \( x = 2 - e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \). The terms alternate but their magnitude still behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which also diverges.

Thus, both endpoints diverge, confirming the interval of convergence is:

\[
\boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}

Simplifying this, the division becomes multiplication by the reciprocal:

\( \frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} \)

Now, let&#x27;s cancel out terms. The (k+1)! divided by k! is just (k+1). Similarly, (x - 2)^{k+1} divided by (x - 2)^k is (x - 2). Then, we have k^k divided by (k+1)^{k+1}.

So putting it all together:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \)

Simplify the exponents in the denominator: (k+1)^{k+1} = (k+1)^k \times (k+1). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k \times (k+1)} \)

The (k+1) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:

\( (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k} \)

Which can be written as:

\( (x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \)

Now, let&#x27;s compute the limit as k approaches infinity of that expression. The term \( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \) is a familiar limit. Let me recall that \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Wait, that&#x27;s similar to the limit definition of 1/e. Let&#x27;s see:

\( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Let me make a substitution: let n = k + 1, so as k approaches infinity, n approaches infinity as well. Then, the expression becomes \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n - 1} = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \times \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \). As n approaches infinity, \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \) approaches 1/e, and \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \) approaches 1. Therefore, the entire limit is 1/e. So, the limit \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \).

Therefore, the limit L from the Ratio Test is:

\( L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e} \)

For convergence, we need L &lt; 1:

\( \frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e \)

So, the radius of convergence is e, and the interval is centered at x = 2 with radius e. So, the interval is (2 - e, 2 + e). But we need to check the endpoints, x = 2 - e and x = 2 + e, to see if the series converges there.

First, let&#x27;s check x = 2 + e. Substitute x = 2 + e into the original series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (e)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplify the term: \( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, is this convergent?

Perhaps we can use Stirling&#x27;s approximation for k!, which is \( k! \approx k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Let&#x27;s substitute that into the term:

\( \frac{k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \times e^k}{k^k} = \sqrt{2\pi k} \)

So, the general term behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which goes to infinity as k approaches infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms is not zero; hence, the series diverges at x = 2 + e.

Now, check x = 2 - e. Substitute x = 2 - e into the series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \)

So, the terms are \( \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \), which is \( (-1)^k \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Similar to the previous case, using Stirling&#x27;s approximation:

\( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \approx \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Therefore, the general term is \( (-1)^k \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which alternates but the absolute value still tends to infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms does not approach zero, so by the Divergence Test, the series diverges at x = 2 - e as well.

Wait a second, but let me verify once again the endpoint substitution. For x = 2 + e, we have (x - 2) = e, so the term becomes e^k. So, the term is k! e^k /k^k. Using Stirling&#x27;s formula:

k! ~ sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k. So, substituting:

sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k * e^k /k^k = sqrt(2 pi k). So, yes, the terms go to infinity, so divergence.

Similarly, at x = 2 - e, the terms are (-e)^k * k! /k^k, which alternates in sign but magnitude is the same as before, sqrt(2 pi k), so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero. Hence, divergence at both endpoints.

Therefore, the interval of convergence is indeed (2 - e, 2 + e), excluding the endpoints.

Starting with a_k = k! (x - 2)^k /k^k.

Compute a_{k+1}/a_k:

[(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1} / (k+1)^{k+1}] / [k! (x - 2)^k /k^k]

= (k+1)(x - 2) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * (k+1) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * k^k / (k+1)^k

= (x - 2) * [k/(k+1)]^k

Then, the limit as k-&gt;infty [k/(k+1)]^k = 1/e.

Therefore, L = |x - 2| / e. So, convergence when |x - 2| &lt; e, so radius e, center at 2. Then, endpoints checked, both diverge. So yes, the interval is open.

Therefore, the final answer is (2 - e, 2 + e). In boxed form, that&#x27;s \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.

Simplifying the ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \):

\[
\frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} = (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}}
\]

This simplifies further to:

\[
(x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k
\]

Taking the limit as \( k \to \infty \), we use the known result \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \). Thus, the limit \( L \) becomes:

\[
L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e}
\]

For convergence, we need \( L &lt; 1 \):

\[
\frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e
\]

This gives the radius of convergence as \( e \), centered at \( x = 2 \). The interval is \( (2 - e, 2 + e) \).

Next, we check the endpoints \( x = 2 \pm e \):

- For \( x = 2 + e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Using Stirling&#x27;s approximation, the terms behave like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which diverges.
- For \( x = 2 - e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \). The terms alternate but their magnitude still behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which also diverges.

Thus, both endpoints diverge, confirming the interval of convergence is:

Now, let&#x27;s cancel out terms. The (k+1)! divided by k! is just (k+1). Similarly, (x - 2)^{k+1} divided by (x - 2)^k is (x - 2). Then, we have k^k divided by (k+1)^{k+1}.

So putting it all together:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \)

Simplify the exponents in the denominator: (k+1)^{k+1} = (k+1)^k \times (k+1). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k \times (k+1)} \)

The (k+1) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:

\( (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k} \)

Which can be written as:

\( (x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \)

Now, let&#x27;s compute the limit as k approaches infinity of that expression. The term \( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \) is a familiar limit. Let me recall that \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Wait, that&#x27;s similar to the limit definition of 1/e. Let&#x27;s see:

\( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Let me make a substitution: let n = k + 1, so as k approaches infinity, n approaches infinity as well. Then, the expression becomes \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n - 1} = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \times \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \). As n approaches infinity, \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \) approaches 1/e, and \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \) approaches 1. Therefore, the entire limit is 1/e. So, the limit \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \).

Therefore, the limit L from the Ratio Test is:

\( L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e} \)

For convergence, we need L &lt; 1:

First, let&#x27;s check x = 2 + e. Substitute x = 2 + e into the original series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (e)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplify the term: \( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, is this convergent?

Perhaps we can use Stirling&#x27;s approximation for k!, which is \( k! \approx k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Let&#x27;s substitute that into the term:

\( \frac{k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \times e^k}{k^k} = \sqrt{2\pi k} \)

So, the general term behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which goes to infinity as k approaches infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms is not zero; hence, the series diverges at x = 2 + e.

Now, check x = 2 - e. Substitute x = 2 - e into the series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \)

So, the terms are \( \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \), which is \( (-1)^k \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Similar to the previous case, using Stirling&#x27;s approximation:

Wait a second, but let me verify once again the endpoint substitution. For x = 2 + e, we have (x - 2) = e, so the term becomes e^k. So, the term is k! e^k /k^k. Using Stirling&#x27;s formula:

k! ~ sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k. So, substituting:

sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k * e^k /k^k = sqrt(2 pi k). So, yes, the terms go to infinity, so divergence.

Similarly, at x = 2 - e, the terms are (-e)^k * k! /k^k, which alternates in sign but magnitude is the same as before, sqrt(2 pi k), so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero. Hence, divergence at both endpoints.

Therefore, the interval of convergence is indeed (2 - e, 2 + e), excluding the endpoints.

But wait, just to make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in the Ratio Test computation. Let me go through it again.

Starting with a_k = k! (x - 2)^k /k^k.

Compute a_{k+1}/a_k:

[(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1} / (k+1)^{k+1}] / [k! (x - 2)^k /k^k]

= (k+1)(x - 2) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * (k+1) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * k^k / (k+1)^k

= (x - 2) * [k/(k+1)]^k

Then, the limit as k-&gt;infty [k/(k+1)]^k = 1/e.

Therefore, L = |x - 2| / e. So, convergence when |x - 2| &lt; e, so radius e, center at 2. Then, endpoints checked, both diverge. So yes, the interval is open.

Therefore, the final answer is (2 - e, 2 + e). In boxed form, that&#x27;s \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.

**Final Answer**
The interval of convergence is \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the interval of convergence for the series \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k!(x-2)^k}{k^k} \), we use the Ratio Test. 

First, we consider the general term \( a_k = \frac{k!(x - 2)^k}{k^k} \). Applying the Ratio Test, we compute the limit:

\[
L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right|
\]

Simplifying the ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \):

\[
\frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} = (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}}
\]

This simplifies further to:

\[
(x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k
\]

Taking the limit as \( k \to \infty \), we use the known result \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \). Thus, the limit \( L \) becomes:

\[
L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e}
\]

For convergence, we need \( L &lt; 1 \):

\[
\frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e
\]

This gives the radius of convergence as \( e \), centered at \( x = 2 \). The interval is \( (2 - e, 2 + e) \).

Next, we check the endpoints \( x = 2 \pm e \):

- For \( x = 2 + e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Using Stirling&#x27;s approximation, the terms behave like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which diverges.
- For \( x = 2 - e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \). The terms alternate but their magnitude still behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which also diverges.

Thus, both endpoints diverge, confirming the interval of convergence is:

\[
\boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s tackle this interval of convergence problem for the series \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k!(x-2)^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, okay. So, interval of convergence usually involves using the Ratio Test or the Root Test. Since this series has factorials and exponentials, maybe the Ratio Test is the way to go? Let me recall that the Ratio Test involves taking the limit of the absolute value of a_{k+1}/a_k as k approaches infinity, and then seeing if that limit is less than 1 for convergence.

First, let me write out the general term of the series: \( a_k = \frac{k!(x - 2)^k}{k^k} \). So, to apply the Ratio Test, I need to compute \( L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right| \).

Let&#x27;s compute that step by step. The ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \) would be:

\( \frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \div \frac{k! (x - 2)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplifying this, the division becomes multiplication by the reciprocal:

\( \frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} \)

Now, let&#x27;s cancel out terms. The (k+1)! divided by k! is just (k+1). Similarly, (x - 2)^{k+1} divided by (x - 2)^k is (x - 2). Then, we have k^k divided by (k+1)^{k+1}.

So putting it all together:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \)

Simplify the exponents in the denominator: (k+1)^{k+1} = (k+1)^k \times (k+1). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k \times (k+1)} \)

The (k+1) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:

\( (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k} \)

Which can be written as:

\( (x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \)

Now, let&#x27;s compute the limit as k approaches infinity of that expression. The term \( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \) is a familiar limit. Let me recall that \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Wait, that&#x27;s similar to the limit definition of 1/e. Let&#x27;s see:

\( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Let me make a substitution: let n = k + 1, so as k approaches infinity, n approaches infinity as well. Then, the expression becomes \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n - 1} = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \times \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \). As n approaches infinity, \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \) approaches 1/e, and \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \) approaches 1. Therefore, the entire limit is 1/e. So, the limit \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \).

Therefore, the limit L from the Ratio Test is:

\( L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e} \)

For convergence, we need L &lt; 1:

\( \frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e \)

So, the radius of convergence is e, and the interval is centered at x = 2 with radius e. So, the interval is (2 - e, 2 + e). But we need to check the endpoints, x = 2 - e and x = 2 + e, to see if the series converges there.

First, let&#x27;s check x = 2 + e. Substitute x = 2 + e into the original series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (e)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplify the term: \( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, is this convergent?

Perhaps we can use Stirling&#x27;s approximation for k!, which is \( k! \approx k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Let&#x27;s substitute that into the term:

\( \frac{k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \times e^k}{k^k} = \sqrt{2\pi k} \)

So, the general term behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which goes to infinity as k approaches infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms is not zero; hence, the series diverges at x = 2 + e.

Now, check x = 2 - e. Substitute x = 2 - e into the series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \)

So, the terms are \( \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \), which is \( (-1)^k \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Similar to the previous case, using Stirling&#x27;s approximation:

\( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \approx \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Therefore, the general term is \( (-1)^k \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which alternates but the absolute value still tends to infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms does not approach zero, so by the Divergence Test, the series diverges at x = 2 - e as well.

Therefore, both endpoints diverge, so the interval of convergence is entirely open: (2 - e, 2 + e).

Wait a second, but let me verify once again the endpoint substitution. For x = 2 + e, we have (x - 2) = e, so the term becomes e^k. So, the term is k! e^k /k^k. Using Stirling&#x27;s formula:

k! ~ sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k. So, substituting:

sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k * e^k /k^k = sqrt(2 pi k). So, yes, the terms go to infinity, so divergence.

Similarly, at x = 2 - e, the terms are (-e)^k * k! /k^k, which alternates in sign but magnitude is the same as before, sqrt(2 pi k), so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero. Hence, divergence at both endpoints.

Therefore, the interval of convergence is indeed (2 - e, 2 + e), excluding the endpoints.

But wait, just to make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in the Ratio Test computation. Let me go through it again.

Starting with a_k = k! (x - 2)^k /k^k.

Compute a_{k+1}/a_k:

[(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1} / (k+1)^{k+1}] / [k! (x - 2)^k /k^k]

= (k+1)(x - 2) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * (k+1) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * k^k / (k+1)^k

= (x - 2) * [k/(k+1)]^k

Then, the limit as k-&gt;infty [k/(k+1)]^k = 1/e.

Therefore, L = |x - 2| / e. So, convergence when |x - 2| &lt; e, so radius e, center at 2. Then, endpoints checked, both diverge. So yes, the interval is open.

Therefore, the final answer is (2 - e, 2 + e). In boxed form, that&#x27;s \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.

**Final Answer**
The interval of convergence is \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the interval of convergence for the series \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k!(x-2)^k}{k^k} \), we use the Ratio Test. 

First, we consider the general term \( a_k = \frac{k!(x - 2)^k}{k^k} \). Applying the Ratio Test, we compute the limit:

\[
L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right|
\]

Simplifying the ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \):

\[
\frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} = (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}}
\]

This simplifies further to:

\[
(x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k
\]

Taking the limit as \( k \to \infty \), we use the known result \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \). Thus, the limit \( L \) becomes:

\[
L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e}
\]

For convergence, we need \( L &lt; 1 \):

\[
\frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e
\]

This gives the radius of convergence as \( e \), centered at \( x = 2 \). The interval is \( (2 - e, 2 + e) \).

Next, we check the endpoints \( x = 2 \pm e \):

- For \( x = 2 + e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Using Stirling&#x27;s approximation, the terms behave like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which diverges.
- For \( x = 2 - e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \). The terms alternate but their magnitude still behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which also diverges.

Thus, both endpoints diverge, confirming the interval of convergence is:

Now, let&#x27;s cancel out terms. The (k+1)! divided by k! is just (k+1). Similarly, (x - 2)^{k+1} divided by (x - 2)^k is (x - 2). Then, we have k^k divided by (k+1)^{k+1}.

So putting it all together:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \)

Simplify the exponents in the denominator: (k+1)^{k+1} = (k+1)^k \times (k+1). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k \times (k+1)} \)

The (k+1) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:

\( (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k} \)

Which can be written as:

\( (x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \)

Now, let&#x27;s compute the limit as k approaches infinity of that expression. The term \( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \) is a familiar limit.

\( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Let me make a substitution: let n = k + 1, so as k approaches infinity, n approaches infinity as well. Then, the expression becomes \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n - 1} = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \times \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \). As n approaches infinity, \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \) approaches 1/e, and \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \) approaches 1. Therefore, the entire limit is 1/e. So, the limit \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \).

Therefore, the limit L from the Ratio Test is:

\( L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e} \)

For convergence, we need L &lt; 1:

\( \frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e \)

So, the radius of convergence is e, and the interval is centered at x = 2 with radius e. So, the interval is (2 - e, 2 + e). But we need to check the endpoints, x = 2 - e and x = 2 + e, to see if the series converges there.

First, let&#x27;s check x = 2 + e. Substitute x = 2 + e into the original series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (e)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplify the term: \( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, is this convergent?

Perhaps we can use Stirling&#x27;s approximation for k!, which is \( k! \approx k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Let&#x27;s substitute that into the term:

\( \frac{k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \times e^k}{k^k} = \sqrt{2\pi k} \)

So, the general term behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which goes to infinity as k approaches infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms is not zero; hence, the series diverges at x = 2 + e.

Now, check x = 2 - e. Substitute x = 2 - e into the series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \)

So, the terms are \( \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \), which is \( (-1)^k \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Similar to the previous case, using Stirling&#x27;s approximation:

\( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \approx \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Therefore, the general term is \( (-1)^k \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which alternates but the absolute value still tends to infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms does not approach zero, so by the Divergence Test, the series diverges at x = 2 - e as well.

= (x - 2) * (k+1) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * k^k / (k+1)^k

= (x - 2) * [k/(k+1)]^k

Then, the limit as k-&gt;infty [k/(k+1)]^k = 1/e.

Therefore, L = |x - 2| / e. So, convergence when |x - 2| &lt; e, so radius e, center at 2. Then, endpoints checked, both diverge. So yes, the interval is open.

First, we consider the general term \( a_k = \frac{k!(x - 2)^k}{k^k} \). Applying the Ratio Test, we compute the limit:

\[
L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right|
\]

Simplifying the ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \):

\[
\frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} = (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}}
\]

This simplifies further to:

\[
(x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k
\]

Taking the limit as \( k \to \infty \), we use the known result \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \). Thus, the limit \( L \) becomes:

\[
L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e}

For convergence, we need \( L &lt; 1 \):

\[

\]

This gives the radius of convergence as \( e \), centered at \( x = 2 \). The interval is \( (2 - e, 2 + e) \).

Next, we check the endpoints \( x = 2 \pm e \):

- For \( x = 2 + e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Using Stirling&#x27;s approximation, the terms behave like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which diverges.
- For \( x = 2 - e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \). The terms alternate but their magnitude still behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which also diverges.

Now, let&#x27;s cancel out terms. The (k+1)! divided by k! is just (k+1). Similarly, (x - 2)^{k+1} divided by (x - 2)^k is (x - 2). Then, we have k^k divided by (k+1)^{k+1}.

So putting it all together:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \)

Simplify the exponents in the denominator: (k+1)^{k+1} = (k+1)^k \times (k+1). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k \times (k+1)} \)

The (k+1) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:

\( (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k} \)

Which can be written as:

\( (x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \)

Now, let&#x27;s compute the limit as k approaches infinity of that expression. The term \( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \) is a familiar limit. Let me recall that \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Wait, that&#x27;s similar to the limit definition of 1/e. Let&#x27;s see:

\( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Let me make a substitution: let n = k + 1, so as k approaches infinity, n approaches infinity as well. Then, the expression becomes \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n - 1} = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \times \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \). As n approaches infinity, \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \) approaches 1/e, and \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \) approaches 1. Therefore, the entire limit is 1/e. So, the limit \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \).

Therefore, the limit L from the Ratio Test is:

\( L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e} \)

For convergence, we need L &lt; 1:

\( \frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e \)

So, the radius of convergence is e, and the interval is centered at x = 2 with radius e. So, the interval is (2 - e, 2 + e). But we need to check the endpoints, x = 2 - e and x = 2 + e, to see if the series converges there.

First, let&#x27;s check x = 2 + e. Substitute x = 2 + e into the original series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (e)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplify the term: \( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, is this convergent?

Perhaps we can use Stirling&#x27;s approximation for k!, which is \( k! \approx k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Let&#x27;s substitute that into the term:

\( \frac{k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \times e^k}{k^k} = \sqrt{2\pi k} \)

So, the general term behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which goes to infinity as k approaches infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms is not zero; hence, the series diverges at x = 2 + e.

Now, check x = 2 - e. Substitute x = 2 - e into the series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \)

So, the terms are \( \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \), which is \( (-1)^k \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Similar to the previous case, using Stirling&#x27;s approximation:

\( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \approx \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Therefore, the general term is \( (-1)^k \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which alternates but the absolute value still tends to infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms does not approach zero, so by the Divergence Test, the series diverges at x = 2 - e as well.

Therefore, both endpoints diverge, so the interval of convergence is entirely open: (2 - e, 2 + e).

Wait a second, but let me verify once again the endpoint substitution. For x = 2 + e, we have (x - 2) = e, so the term becomes e^k. So, the term is k! e^k /k^k. Using Stirling&#x27;s formula:

k! ~ sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k. So, substituting:

sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k * e^k /k^k = sqrt(2 pi k). So, yes, the terms go to infinity, so divergence.

Similarly, at x = 2 - e, the terms are (-e)^k * k! /k^k, which alternates in sign but magnitude is the same as before, sqrt(2 pi k), so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero. Hence, divergence at both endpoints.

Therefore, the interval of convergence is indeed (2 - e, 2 + e), excluding the endpoints.

But wait, just to make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in the Ratio Test computation. Let me go through it again.

Starting with a_k = k! (x - 2)^k /k^k.

Compute a_{k+1}/a_k:

[(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1} / (k+1)^{k+1}] / [k! (x - 2)^k /k^k]

= (k+1)(x - 2) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * (k+1) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * k^k / (k+1)^k

= (x - 2) * [k/(k+1)]^k

Then, the limit as k-&gt;infty [k/(k+1)]^k = 1/e.

Therefore, L = |x - 2| / e. So, convergence when |x - 2| &lt; e, so radius e, center at 2. Then, endpoints checked, both diverge. So yes, the interval is open.

Therefore, the final answer is (2 - e, 2 + e). In boxed form, that&#x27;s \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.

**Final Answer**
The interval of convergence is \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the interval of convergence for the series \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k!(x-2)^k}{k^k} \), we use the Ratio Test. 

First, we consider the general term \( a_k = \frac{k!(x - 2)^k}{k^k} \). Applying the Ratio Test, we compute the limit:

\[
L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right|
\]

Simplifying the ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \):

\[
\frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} = (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}}
\]

This simplifies further to:

\[
(x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k
\]

Taking the limit as \( k \to \infty \), we use the known result \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \). Thus, the limit \( L \) becomes:

\[
L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e}
\]

For convergence, we need \( L &lt; 1 \):

\[
\frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e
\]

This gives the radius of convergence as \( e \), centered at \( x = 2 \). The interval is \( (2 - e, 2 + e) \).

Next, we check the endpoints \( x = 2 \pm e \):

- For \( x = 2 + e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Using Stirling&#x27;s approximation, the terms behave like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which diverges.
- For \( x = 2 - e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \). The terms alternate but their magnitude still behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which also diverges.

Thus, both endpoints diverge, confirming the interval of convergence is:

\[
\boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s tackle this interval of convergence problem for the series \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k!(x-2)^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, okay. So, interval of convergence usually involves using the Ratio Test or the Root Test. Since this series has factorials and exponentials, maybe the Ratio Test is the way to go? Let me recall that the Ratio Test involves taking the limit of the absolute value of a_{k+1}/a_k as k approaches infinity, and then seeing if that limit is less than 1 for convergence.

First, let me write out the general term of the series: \( a_k = \frac{k!(x - 2)^k}{k^k} \). So, to apply the Ratio Test, I need to compute \( L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right| \).

Let&#x27;s compute that step by step. The ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \) would be:

\( \frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \div \frac{k! (x - 2)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplifying this, the division becomes multiplication by the reciprocal:

\( \frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} \)

Now, let&#x27;s cancel out terms. The (k+1)! divided by k! is just (k+1). Similarly, (x - 2)^{k+1} divided by (x - 2)^k is (x - 2). Then, we have k^k divided by (k+1)^{k+1}.

So putting it all together:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \)

Simplify the exponents in the denominator: (k+1)^{k+1} = (k+1)^k \times (k+1). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k \times (k+1)} \)

The (k+1) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:

\( (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k} \)

Which can be written as:

\( (x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \)

Now, let&#x27;s compute the limit as k approaches infinity of that expression. The term \( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \) is a familiar limit. Let me recall that \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Wait, that&#x27;s similar to the limit definition of 1/e. Let&#x27;s see:

\( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Let me make a substitution: let n = k + 1, so as k approaches infinity, n approaches infinity as well. Then, the expression becomes \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n - 1} = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \times \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \). As n approaches infinity, \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \) approaches 1/e, and \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \) approaches 1. Therefore, the entire limit is 1/e. So, the limit \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \).

Therefore, the limit L from the Ratio Test is:

\( L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e} \)

For convergence, we need L &lt; 1:

\( \frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e \)

So, the radius of convergence is e, and the interval is centered at x = 2 with radius e. So, the interval is (2 - e, 2 + e). But we need to check the endpoints, x = 2 - e and x = 2 + e, to see if the series converges there.

First, let&#x27;s check x = 2 + e. Substitute x = 2 + e into the original series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (e)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplify the term: \( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, is this convergent?

Perhaps we can use Stirling&#x27;s approximation for k!, which is \( k! \approx k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Let&#x27;s substitute that into the term:

\( \frac{k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \times e^k}{k^k} = \sqrt{2\pi k} \)

So, the general term behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which goes to infinity as k approaches infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms is not zero; hence, the series diverges at x = 2 + e.

Now, check x = 2 - e. Substitute x = 2 - e into the series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \)

So, the terms are \( \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \), which is \( (-1)^k \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Similar to the previous case, using Stirling&#x27;s approximation:

\( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \approx \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Therefore, the general term is \( (-1)^k \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which alternates but the absolute value still tends to infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms does not approach zero, so by the Divergence Test, the series diverges at x = 2 - e as well.

Therefore, both endpoints diverge, so the interval of convergence is entirely open: (2 - e, 2 + e).

Wait a second, but let me verify once again the endpoint substitution. For x = 2 + e, we have (x - 2) = e, so the term becomes e^k. So, the term is k! e^k /k^k. Using Stirling&#x27;s formula:

k! ~ sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k. So, substituting:

sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k * e^k /k^k = sqrt(2 pi k). So, yes, the terms go to infinity, so divergence.

Similarly, at x = 2 - e, the terms are (-e)^k * k! /k^k, which alternates in sign but magnitude is the same as before, sqrt(2 pi k), so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero. Hence, divergence at both endpoints.

Therefore, the interval of convergence is indeed (2 - e, 2 + e), excluding the endpoints.

But wait, just to make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in the Ratio Test computation. Let me go through it again.

Starting with a_k = k! (x - 2)^k /k^k.

Compute a_{k+1}/a_k:

[(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1} / (k+1)^{k+1}] / [k! (x - 2)^k /k^k]

= (k+1)(x - 2) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * (k+1) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * k^k / (k+1)^k

= (x - 2) * [k/(k+1)]^k

Then, the limit as k-&gt;infty [k/(k+1)]^k = 1/e.

Therefore, L = |x - 2| / e. So, convergence when |x - 2| &lt; e, so radius e, center at 2. Then, endpoints checked, both diverge. So yes, the interval is open.

Therefore, the final answer is (2 - e, 2 + e). In boxed form, that&#x27;s \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.

**Final Answer**
The interval of convergence is \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the interval of convergence for the series \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k!(x-2)^k}{k^k} \), we use the Ratio Test. 

First, we consider the general term \( a_k = \frac{k!(x - 2)^k}{k^k} \). Applying the Ratio Test, we compute the limit:

\[
L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right|
\]

Simplifying the ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \):

\[
\frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} = (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}}
\]

This simplifies further to:

\[
(x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k
\]

Taking the limit as \( k \to \infty \), we use the known result \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \). Thus, the limit \( L \) becomes:

\[
L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e}
\]

For convergence, we need \( L &lt; 1 \):

\[
\frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e
\]

This gives the radius of convergence as \( e \), centered at \( x = 2 \). The interval is \( (2 - e, 2 + e) \).

Next, we check the endpoints \( x = 2 \pm e \):

- For \( x = 2 + e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Using Stirling&#x27;s approximation, the terms behave like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which diverges.
- For \( x = 2 - e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \). The terms alternate but their magnitude still behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which also diverges.

Thus, both endpoints diverge, confirming the interval of convergence is:

So putting it all together:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \)

Simplify the exponents in the denominator: (k+1)^{k+1} = (k+1)^k \times (k+1). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k \times (k+1)} \)

The (k+1) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:

\( (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k} \)

Which can be written as:

\( (x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \)

Now, let&#x27;s compute the limit as k approaches infinity of that expression. The term \( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \) is a familiar limit.

\( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Let me make a substitution: let n = k + 1, so as k approaches infinity, n approaches infinity as well. Then, the expression becomes \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n - 1} = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \times \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \). As n approaches infinity, \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \) approaches 1/e, and \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \) approaches 1. Therefore, the entire limit is 1/e. So, the limit \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \).

Therefore, the limit L from the Ratio Test is:

\( L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e} \)

For convergence, we need L &lt; 1:

\( \frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e \)

So, the radius of convergence is e, and the interval is centered at x = 2 with radius e. So, the interval is (2 - e, 2 + e). But we need to check the endpoints, x = 2 - e and x = 2 + e, to see if the series converges there.

First, let&#x27;s check x = 2 + e. Substitute x = 2 + e into the original series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (e)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplify the term: \( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, is this convergent?

Perhaps we can use Stirling&#x27;s approximation for k!, which is \( k! \approx k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Let&#x27;s substitute that into the term:

\( \frac{k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \times e^k}{k^k} = \sqrt{2\pi k} \)

So, the general term behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which goes to infinity as k approaches infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms is not zero; hence, the series diverges at x = 2 + e.

Now, check x = 2 - e. Substitute x = 2 - e into the series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \)

So, the terms are \( \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \), which is \( (-1)^k \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Similar to the previous case, using Stirling&#x27;s approximation:

= (x - 2) * k^k / (k+1)^k

= (x - 2) * [k/(k+1)]^k

Then, the limit as k-&gt;infty [k/(k+1)]^k = 1/e.

Therefore, L = |x - 2| / e. So, convergence when |x - 2| &lt; e, so radius e, center at 2. Then, endpoints checked, both diverge. So yes, the interval is open.

Therefore, the final answer is (2 - e, 2 + e). In boxed form, that&#x27;s \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.

The interval of convergence is \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the interval of convergence for the series \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k!(x-2)^k}{k^k} \), we use the Ratio Test. 

First, we consider the general term \( a_k = \frac{k!(x - 2)^k}{k^k} \). Applying the Ratio Test, we compute the limit:

\[
L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right|
\]

Simplifying the ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \):

\[
\frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} = (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}}
\]

This simplifies further to:

\[
(x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k
\]

Taking the limit as \( k \to \infty \), we use the known result \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \). Thus, the limit \( L \) becomes:

\[
L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e}
\]

For convergence, we need \( L &lt; 1 \):

\[
\frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e
\]

This gives the radius of convergence as \( e \), centered at \( x = 2 \). The interval is \( (2 - e, 2 + e) \).

Next, we check the endpoints \( x = 2 \pm e \):

- For \( x = 2 + e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Using Stirling&#x27;s approximation, the terms behave like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which diverges.
- For \( x = 2 - e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \). The terms alternate but their magnitude still behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which also diverges.

Thus, both endpoints diverge, confirming the interval of convergence is:

\[
\boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s tackle this interval of convergence problem for the series \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k!(x-2)^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, okay. So, interval of convergence usually involves using the Ratio Test or the Root Test. Since this series has factorials and exponentials, maybe the Ratio Test is the way to go? Let me recall that the Ratio Test involves taking the limit of the absolute value of a_{k+1}/a_k as k approaches infinity, and then seeing if that limit is less than 1 for convergence.

First, let me write out the general term of the series: \( a_k = \frac{k!(x - 2)^k}{k^k} \). So, to apply the Ratio Test, I need to compute \( L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right| \).

Let&#x27;s compute that step by step. The ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \) would be:

\( \frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \div \frac{k! (x - 2)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplifying this, the division becomes multiplication by the reciprocal:

\( \frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} \)

Now, let&#x27;s cancel out terms. The (k+1)! divided by k! is just (k+1). Similarly, (x - 2)^{k+1} divided by (x - 2)^k is (x - 2). Then, we have k^k divided by (k+1)^{k+1}.

So putting it all together:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \)

Simplify the exponents in the denominator: (k+1)^{k+1} = (k+1)^k \times (k+1). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k \times (k+1)} \)

The (k+1) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:

\( (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k} \)

Which can be written as:

\( (x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \)

Now, let&#x27;s compute the limit as k approaches infinity of that expression. The term \( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \) is a familiar limit. Let me recall that \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Wait, that&#x27;s similar to the limit definition of 1/e. Let&#x27;s see:

\( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Let me make a substitution: let n = k + 1, so as k approaches infinity, n approaches infinity as well. Then, the expression becomes \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n - 1} = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \times \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \). As n approaches infinity, \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \) approaches 1/e, and \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \) approaches 1. Therefore, the entire limit is 1/e. So, the limit \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \).

Therefore, the limit L from the Ratio Test is:

\( L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e} \)

For convergence, we need L &lt; 1:

\( \frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e \)

So, the radius of convergence is e, and the interval is centered at x = 2 with radius e. So, the interval is (2 - e, 2 + e). But we need to check the endpoints, x = 2 - e and x = 2 + e, to see if the series converges there.

First, let&#x27;s check x = 2 + e. Substitute x = 2 + e into the original series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (e)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplify the term: \( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, is this convergent?

Perhaps we can use Stirling&#x27;s approximation for k!, which is \( k! \approx k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Let&#x27;s substitute that into the term:

\( \frac{k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \times e^k}{k^k} = \sqrt{2\pi k} \)

So, the general term behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which goes to infinity as k approaches infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms is not zero; hence, the series diverges at x = 2 + e.

Now, check x = 2 - e. Substitute x = 2 - e into the series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \)

So, the terms are \( \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \), which is \( (-1)^k \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Similar to the previous case, using Stirling&#x27;s approximation:

\( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \approx \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Therefore, the general term is \( (-1)^k \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which alternates but the absolute value still tends to infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms does not approach zero, so by the Divergence Test, the series diverges at x = 2 - e as well.

Therefore, both endpoints diverge, so the interval of convergence is entirely open: (2 - e, 2 + e).

Wait a second, but let me verify once again the endpoint substitution. For x = 2 + e, we have (x - 2) = e, so the term becomes e^k. So, the term is k! e^k /k^k. Using Stirling&#x27;s formula:

k! ~ sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k. So, substituting:

sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k * e^k /k^k = sqrt(2 pi k). So, yes, the terms go to infinity, so divergence.

Similarly, at x = 2 - e, the terms are (-e)^k * k! /k^k, which alternates in sign but magnitude is the same as before, sqrt(2 pi k), so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero. Hence, divergence at both endpoints.

Therefore, the interval of convergence is indeed (2 - e, 2 + e), excluding the endpoints.

But wait, just to make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in the Ratio Test computation. Let me go through it again.

Starting with a_k = k! (x - 2)^k /k^k.

Compute a_{k+1}/a_k:

[(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1} / (k+1)^{k+1}] / [k! (x - 2)^k /k^k]

= (k+1)(x - 2) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * (k+1) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * k^k / (k+1)^k

= (x - 2) * [k/(k+1)]^k

Then, the limit as k-&gt;infty [k/(k+1)]^k = 1/e.

Therefore, L = |x - 2| / e. So, convergence when |x - 2| &lt; e, so radius e, center at 2. Then, endpoints checked, both diverge. So yes, the interval is open.

Therefore, the final answer is (2 - e, 2 + e). In boxed form, that&#x27;s \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.

**Final Answer**
The interval of convergence is \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the interval of convergence for the series \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k!(x-2)^k}{k^k} \), we use the Ratio Test. 

First, we consider the general term \( a_k = \frac{k!(x - 2)^k}{k^k} \). Applying the Ratio Test, we compute the limit:

\[
L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right|
\]

Simplifying the ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \):

\[
\frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} = (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}}
\]

This simplifies further to:

\[
(x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k
\]

Taking the limit as \( k \to \infty \), we use the known result \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \). Thus, the limit \( L \) becomes:

\[
L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e}
\]

For convergence, we need \( L &lt; 1 \):

\[
\frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e
\]

This gives the radius of convergence as \( e \), centered at \( x = 2 \). The interval is \( (2 - e, 2 + e) \).

Next, we check the endpoints \( x = 2 \pm e \):

- For \( x = 2 + e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Using Stirling&#x27;s approximation, the terms behave like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which diverges.
- For \( x = 2 - e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \). The terms alternate but their magnitude still behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which also diverges.

Thus, both endpoints diverge, confirming the interval of convergence is:

Now, let&#x27;s cancel out terms. The (k+1)! divided by k! is just (k+1). Similarly, (x - 2)^{k+1} divided by (x - 2)^k is (x - 2). Then, we have k^k divided by (k+1)^{k+1}.

So putting it all together:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \)

Simplify the exponents in the denominator: (k+1)^{k+1} = (k+1)^k \times (k+1). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k \times (k+1)} \)

The (k+1) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:

\( (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k} \)

Which can be written as:

\( (x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \)

Now, let&#x27;s compute the limit as k approaches infinity of that expression. The term \( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \) is a familiar limit. Let me recall that \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Wait, that&#x27;s similar to the limit definition of 1/e. Let&#x27;s see:

\( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Let me make a substitution: let n = k + 1, so as k approaches infinity, n approaches infinity as well. Then, the expression becomes \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n - 1} = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \times \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \). As n approaches infinity, \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \) approaches 1/e, and \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \) approaches 1. Therefore, the entire limit is 1/e. So, the limit \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \).

Therefore, the limit L from the Ratio Test is:

\( L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e} \)

For convergence, we need L &lt; 1:

\( \frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e \)

So, the radius of convergence is e, and the interval is centered at x = 2 with radius e. So, the interval is (2 - e, 2 + e). But we need to check the endpoints, x = 2 - e and x = 2 + e, to see if the series converges there.

First, let&#x27;s check x = 2 + e. Substitute x = 2 + e into the original series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (e)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplify the term: \( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, is this convergent?

Perhaps we can use Stirling&#x27;s approximation for k!, which is \( k! \approx k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Let&#x27;s substitute that into the term:

\( \frac{k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \times e^k}{k^k} = \sqrt{2\pi k} \)

So, the general term behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which goes to infinity as k approaches infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms is not zero; hence, the series diverges at x = 2 + e.

Now, check x = 2 - e. Substitute x = 2 - e into the series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \)

So, the terms are \( \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \), which is \( (-1)^k \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Similar to the previous case, using Stirling&#x27;s approximation:

\( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \approx \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Therefore, the general term is \( (-1)^k \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which alternates but the absolute value still tends to infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms does not approach zero, so by the Divergence Test, the series diverges at x = 2 - e as well.

Wait a second, but let me verify once again the endpoint substitution. For x = 2 + e, we have (x - 2) = e, so the term becomes e^k. So, the term is k! e^k /k^k. Using Stirling&#x27;s formula:

k! ~ sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k. So, substituting:

sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k * e^k /k^k = sqrt(2 pi k). So, yes, the terms go to infinity, so divergence.

Similarly, at x = 2 - e, the terms are (-e)^k * k! /k^k, which alternates in sign but magnitude is the same as before, sqrt(2 pi k), so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero. Hence, divergence at both endpoints.

Therefore, the interval of convergence is indeed (2 - e, 2 + e), excluding the endpoints.

Starting with a_k = k! (x - 2)^k /k^k.

[(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1} / (k+1)^{k+1}] / [k! (x - 2)^k /k^k]

= (x - 2) * (k+1) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * k^k / (k+1)^k

= (x - 2) * [k/(k+1)]^k

Then, the limit as k-&gt;infty [k/(k+1)]^k = 1/e.

Therefore, L = |x - 2| / e. So, convergence when |x - 2| &lt; e, so radius e, center at 2. Then, endpoints checked, both diverge. So yes, the interval is open.

Therefore, the final answer is (2 - e, 2 + e). In boxed form, that&#x27;s \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.

\]

This simplifies further to:

\[
(x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k
\]

Taking the limit as \( k \to \infty \), we use the known result \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \). Thus, the limit \( L \) becomes:

Next, we check the endpoints \( x = 2 \pm e \):

Then, the expression becomes \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n - 1} = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \times \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \). As n approaches infinity, \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \) approaches 1/e, and \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \) approaches 1. Therefore, the entire limit is 1/e. So, the limit \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \).

Therefore, the limit L from the Ratio Test is:

\( L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e} \)

For convergence, we need L &lt; 1:

\( \frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e \)

So, the radius of convergence is e, and the interval is centered at x = 2 with radius e. So, the interval is (2 - e, 2 + e). But we need to check the endpoints, x = 2 - e and x = 2 + e, to see if the series converges there.

First, let&#x27;s check x = 2 + e. Substitute x = 2 + e into the original series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (e)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplify the term: \( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, is this convergent?

Perhaps we can use Stirling&#x27;s approximation for k!, which is \( k! \approx k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Let&#x27;s substitute that into the term:

\( \frac{k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \times e^k}{k^k} = \sqrt{2\pi k} \)

So, the general term behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which goes to infinity as k approaches infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms is not zero; hence, the series diverges at x = 2 + e.

Now, check x = 2 - e. Substitute x = 2 - e into the series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \)

So, the terms are \( \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \), which is \( (-1)^k \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Similar to the previous case, using Stirling&#x27;s approximation:

\( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \approx \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Therefore, the general term is \( (-1)^k \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which alternates but the absolute value still tends to infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms does not approach zero, so by the Divergence Test, the series diverges at x = 2 - e as well.

Therefore, both endpoints diverge, so the interval of convergence is entirely open: (2 - e, 2 + e).

Wait a second, but let me verify once again the endpoint substitution. For x = 2 + e, we have (x - 2) = e, so the term becomes e^k. So, the term is k! e^k /k^k. Using Stirling&#x27;s formula:

k! ~ sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k. So, substituting:

sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k * e^k /k^k = sqrt(2 pi k). So, yes, the terms go to infinity, so divergence.

Similarly, at x = 2 - e, the terms are (-e)^k * k! /k^k, which alternates in sign but magnitude is the same as before, sqrt(2 pi k), so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero. Hence, divergence at both endpoints.

Therefore, the interval of convergence is indeed (2 - e, 2 + e), excluding the endpoints.

But wait, just to make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in the Ratio Test computation. Let me go through it again.

Starting with a_k = k! (x - 2)^k /k^k.

Compute a_{k+1}/a_k:

[(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1} / (k+1)^{k+1}] / [k! (x - 2)^k /k^k]

= (k+1)(x - 2) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * (k+1) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * k^k / (k+1)^k

= (x - 2) * [k/(k+1)]^k

Then, the limit as k-&gt;infty [k/(k+1)]^k = 1/e.

Therefore, L = |x - 2| / e. So, convergence when |x - 2| &lt; e, so radius e, center at 2. Then, endpoints checked, both diverge. So yes, the interval is open.

Therefore, the final answer is (2 - e, 2 + e). In boxed form, that&#x27;s \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.

**Final Answer**
The interval of convergence is \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the interval of convergence for the series \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k!(x-2)^k}{k^k} \), we use the Ratio Test. 

First, we consider the general term \( a_k = \frac{k!(x - 2)^k}{k^k} \). Applying the Ratio Test, we compute the limit:

\[
L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right|
\]

Simplifying the ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \):

\[
\frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} = (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}}
\]

This simplifies further to:

\[
(x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k
\]

Taking the limit as \( k \to \infty \), we use the known result \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \). Thus, the limit \( L \) becomes:

\[
L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e}
\]

For convergence, we need \( L &lt; 1 \):

\[
\frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e
\]

This gives the radius of convergence as \( e \), centered at \( x = 2 \). The interval is \( (2 - e, 2 + e) \).

Next, we check the endpoints \( x = 2 \pm e \):

- For \( x = 2 + e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Using Stirling&#x27;s approximation, the terms behave like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which diverges.
- For \( x = 2 - e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \). The terms alternate but their magnitude still behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which also diverges.

Thus, both endpoints diverge, confirming the interval of convergence is:

\[
\boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s tackle this interval of convergence problem for the series \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k!(x-2)^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, okay. So, interval of convergence usually involves using the Ratio Test or the Root Test. Since this series has factorials and exponentials, maybe the Ratio Test is the way to go? Let me recall that the Ratio Test involves taking the limit of the absolute value of a_{k+1}/a_k as k approaches infinity, and then seeing if that limit is less than 1 for convergence.

First, let me write out the general term of the series: \( a_k = \frac{k!(x - 2)^k}{k^k} \). So, to apply the Ratio Test, I need to compute \( L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right| \).

Let&#x27;s compute that step by step. The ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \) would be:

\( \frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \div \frac{k! (x - 2)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplifying this, the division becomes multiplication by the reciprocal:

\( \frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} \)

Now, let&#x27;s cancel out terms. The (k+1)! divided by k! is just (k+1). Similarly, (x - 2)^{k+1} divided by (x - 2)^k is (x - 2). Then, we have k^k divided by (k+1)^{k+1}.

So putting it all together:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \)

Simplify the exponents in the denominator: (k+1)^{k+1} = (k+1)^k \times (k+1). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k \times (k+1)} \)

The (k+1) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:

\( (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k} \)

Which can be written as:

\( (x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \)

Now, let&#x27;s compute the limit as k approaches infinity of that expression. The term \( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \) is a familiar limit. Let me recall that \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Wait, that&#x27;s similar to the limit definition of 1/e. Let&#x27;s see:

\( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Let me make a substitution: let n = k + 1, so as k approaches infinity, n approaches infinity as well. Then, the expression becomes \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n - 1} = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \times \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \). As n approaches infinity, \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \) approaches 1/e, and \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \) approaches 1. Therefore, the entire limit is 1/e. So, the limit \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \).

Therefore, the limit L from the Ratio Test is:

\( L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e} \)

For convergence, we need L &lt; 1:

\( \frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e \)

So, the radius of convergence is e, and the interval is centered at x = 2 with radius e. So, the interval is (2 - e, 2 + e). But we need to check the endpoints, x = 2 - e and x = 2 + e, to see if the series converges there.

First, let&#x27;s check x = 2 + e. Substitute x = 2 + e into the original series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (e)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplify the term: \( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, is this convergent?

Perhaps we can use Stirling&#x27;s approximation for k!, which is \( k! \approx k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Let&#x27;s substitute that into the term:

\( \frac{k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \times e^k}{k^k} = \sqrt{2\pi k} \)

So, the general term behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which goes to infinity as k approaches infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms is not zero; hence, the series diverges at x = 2 + e.

Now, check x = 2 - e. Substitute x = 2 - e into the series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \)

So, the terms are \( \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \), which is \( (-1)^k \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Similar to the previous case, using Stirling&#x27;s approximation:

\( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \approx \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Therefore, the general term is \( (-1)^k \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which alternates but the absolute value still tends to infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms does not approach zero, so by the Divergence Test, the series diverges at x = 2 - e as well.

Therefore, both endpoints diverge, so the interval of convergence is entirely open: (2 - e, 2 + e).

Wait a second, but let me verify once again the endpoint substitution. For x = 2 + e, we have (x - 2) = e, so the term becomes e^k. So, the term is k! e^k /k^k. Using Stirling&#x27;s formula:

k! ~ sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k. So, substituting:

sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k * e^k /k^k = sqrt(2 pi k). So, yes, the terms go to infinity, so divergence.

Similarly, at x = 2 - e, the terms are (-e)^k * k! /k^k, which alternates in sign but magnitude is the same as before, sqrt(2 pi k), so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero. Hence, divergence at both endpoints.

Therefore, the interval of convergence is indeed (2 - e, 2 + e), excluding the endpoints.

But wait, just to make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in the Ratio Test computation. Let me go through it again.

Starting with a_k = k! (x - 2)^k /k^k.

Compute a_{k+1}/a_k:

[(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1} / (k+1)^{k+1}] / [k! (x - 2)^k /k^k]

= (k+1)(x - 2) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * (k+1) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * k^k / (k+1)^k

= (x - 2) * [k/(k+1)]^k

Then, the limit as k-&gt;infty [k/(k+1)]^k = 1/e.

Therefore, L = |x - 2| / e. So, convergence when |x - 2| &lt; e, so radius e, center at 2. Then, endpoints checked, both diverge. So yes, the interval is open.

Therefore, the final answer is (2 - e, 2 + e). In boxed form, that&#x27;s \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.

**Final Answer**
The interval of convergence is \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the interval of convergence for the series \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k!(x-2)^k}{k^k} \), we use the Ratio Test. 

First, we consider the general term \( a_k = \frac{k!(x - 2)^k}{k^k} \). Applying the Ratio Test, we compute the limit:

\[
L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right|
\]

Simplifying the ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \):

\[
\frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} = (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}}
\]

This simplifies further to:

\[
(x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k
\]

Taking the limit as \( k \to \infty \), we use the known result \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \). Thus, the limit \( L \) becomes:

\[
L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e}
\]

For convergence, we need \( L &lt; 1 \):

\[
\frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e
\]

This gives the radius of convergence as \( e \), centered at \( x = 2 \). The interval is \( (2 - e, 2 + e) \).

Next, we check the endpoints \( x = 2 \pm e \):

- For \( x = 2 + e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Using Stirling&#x27;s approximation, the terms behave like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which diverges.
- For \( x = 2 - e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \). The terms alternate but their magnitude still behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which also diverges.

Thus, both endpoints diverge, confirming the interval of convergence is:

Now, let&#x27;s cancel out terms. The (k+1)! divided by k! is just (k+1). Similarly, (x - 2)^{k+1} divided by (x - 2)^k is (x - 2). Then, we have k^k divided by (k+1)^{k+1}.

So putting it all together:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \)

Simplify the exponents in the denominator: (k+1)^{k+1} = (k+1)^k \times (k+1). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k \times (k+1)} \)

The (k+1) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:

\( (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k} \)

Which can be written as:

Now, let&#x27;s compute the limit as k approaches infinity of that expression. The term \( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \) is a familiar limit.

Then, the expression becomes \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n - 1} = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \times \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \). As n approaches infinity, \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \) approaches 1/e, and \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \) approaches 1. Therefore, the entire limit is 1/e. So, the limit \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \).

Therefore, the limit L from the Ratio Test is:

\( L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e} \)

For convergence, we need L &lt; 1:

First, let&#x27;s check x = 2 + e. Substitute x = 2 + e into the original series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (e)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplify the term: \( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, is this convergent?

Perhaps we can use Stirling&#x27;s approximation for k!, which is \( k! \approx k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Let&#x27;s substitute that into the term:

\( \frac{k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \times e^k}{k^k} = \sqrt{2\pi k} \)

So, the general term behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which goes to infinity as k approaches infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms is not zero; hence, the series diverges at x = 2 + e.

Now, check x = 2 - e. Substitute x = 2 - e into the series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \)

So, the terms are \( \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \), which is \( (-1)^k \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Similar to the previous case, using Stirling&#x27;s approximation:

= (x - 2) * k^k / (k+1)^k

= (x - 2) * [k/(k+1)]^k

Then, the limit as k-&gt;infty [k/(k+1)]^k = 1/e.

Therefore, L = |x - 2| / e. So, convergence when |x - 2| &lt; e, so radius e, center at 2. Then, endpoints checked, both diverge. So yes, the interval is open.

To determine the interval of convergence for the series \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k!(x-2)^k}{k^k} \), we use the Ratio Test. 

First, we consider the general term \( a_k = \frac{k!(x - 2)^k}{k^k} \). Applying the Ratio Test, we compute the limit:

\[
L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right|
\]

Simplifying the ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \):

\[
\frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} = (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}}
\]

This simplifies further to:

\[
(x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k
\]

Taking the limit as \( k \to \infty \), we use the known result \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \). Thus, the limit \( L \) becomes:

\[
L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e}
\]

For convergence, we need \( L &lt; 1 \):

\[
\frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e
\]

This gives the radius of convergence as \( e \), centered at \( x = 2 \). The interval is \( (2 - e, 2 + e) \).

Next, we check the endpoints \( x = 2 \pm e \):

- For \( x = 2 + e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Using Stirling&#x27;s approximation, the terms behave like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which diverges.
- For \( x = 2 - e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \). The terms alternate but their magnitude still behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which also diverges.

Thus, both endpoints diverge, confirming the interval of convergence is:

\[
\boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s tackle this interval of convergence problem for the series \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k!(x-2)^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, okay. So, interval of convergence usually involves using the Ratio Test or the Root Test. Since this series has factorials and exponentials, maybe the Ratio Test is the way to go? Let me recall that the Ratio Test involves taking the limit of the absolute value of a_{k+1}/a_k as k approaches infinity, and then seeing if that limit is less than 1 for convergence.

First, let me write out the general term of the series: \( a_k = \frac{k!(x - 2)^k}{k^k} \). So, to apply the Ratio Test, I need to compute \( L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right| \).

Let&#x27;s compute that step by step. The ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \) would be:

\( \frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \div \frac{k! (x - 2)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplifying this, the division becomes multiplication by the reciprocal:

\( \frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} \)

Now, let&#x27;s cancel out terms. The (k+1)! divided by k! is just (k+1). Similarly, (x - 2)^{k+1} divided by (x - 2)^k is (x - 2). Then, we have k^k divided by (k+1)^{k+1}.

So putting it all together:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \)

Simplify the exponents in the denominator: (k+1)^{k+1} = (k+1)^k \times (k+1). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\( (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k \times (k+1)} \)

The (k+1) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leaving:

\( (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^k} \)

Which can be written as:

\( (x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \)

Now, let&#x27;s compute the limit as k approaches infinity of that expression. The term \( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k \) is a familiar limit. Let me recall that \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Wait, that&#x27;s similar to the limit definition of 1/e. Let&#x27;s see:

\( \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k+1} \right)^k \). Let me make a substitution: let n = k + 1, so as k approaches infinity, n approaches infinity as well. Then, the expression becomes \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{n - 1} = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \times \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \). As n approaches infinity, \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^n \) approaches 1/e, and \( \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)^{-1} \) approaches 1. Therefore, the entire limit is 1/e. So, the limit \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \).

Therefore, the limit L from the Ratio Test is:

\( L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e} \)

For convergence, we need L &lt; 1:

\( \frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e \)

So, the radius of convergence is e, and the interval is centered at x = 2 with radius e. So, the interval is (2 - e, 2 + e). But we need to check the endpoints, x = 2 - e and x = 2 + e, to see if the series converges there.

First, let&#x27;s check x = 2 + e. Substitute x = 2 + e into the original series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (e)^k}{k^k} \)

Simplify the term: \( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Hmm, is this convergent?

Perhaps we can use Stirling&#x27;s approximation for k!, which is \( k! \approx k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Let&#x27;s substitute that into the term:

\( \frac{k^k e^{-k} \sqrt{2\pi k} \times e^k}{k^k} = \sqrt{2\pi k} \)

So, the general term behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which goes to infinity as k approaches infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms is not zero; hence, the series diverges at x = 2 + e.

Now, check x = 2 - e. Substitute x = 2 - e into the series:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \)

So, the terms are \( \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \), which is \( (-1)^k \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Similar to the previous case, using Stirling&#x27;s approximation:

\( \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \approx \sqrt{2\pi k} \). Therefore, the general term is \( (-1)^k \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which alternates but the absolute value still tends to infinity. Therefore, the limit of the terms does not approach zero, so by the Divergence Test, the series diverges at x = 2 - e as well.

Therefore, both endpoints diverge, so the interval of convergence is entirely open: (2 - e, 2 + e).

Wait a second, but let me verify once again the endpoint substitution. For x = 2 + e, we have (x - 2) = e, so the term becomes e^k. So, the term is k! e^k /k^k. Using Stirling&#x27;s formula:

k! ~ sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k. So, substituting:

sqrt(2 pi k) (k/e)^k * e^k /k^k = sqrt(2 pi k). So, yes, the terms go to infinity, so divergence.

Similarly, at x = 2 - e, the terms are (-e)^k * k! /k^k, which alternates in sign but magnitude is the same as before, sqrt(2 pi k), so again, the terms don&#x27;t approach zero. Hence, divergence at both endpoints.

Therefore, the interval of convergence is indeed (2 - e, 2 + e), excluding the endpoints.

But wait, just to make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in the Ratio Test computation. Let me go through it again.

Starting with a_k = k! (x - 2)^k /k^k.

Compute a_{k+1}/a_k:

[(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1} / (k+1)^{k+1}] / [k! (x - 2)^k /k^k]

= (k+1)(x - 2) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * (k+1) / (k+1)^{k+1} * k^k

= (x - 2) * k^k / (k+1)^k

= (x - 2) * [k/(k+1)]^k

Then, the limit as k-&gt;infty [k/(k+1)]^k = 1/e.

Therefore, L = |x - 2| / e. So, convergence when |x - 2| &lt; e, so radius e, center at 2. Then, endpoints checked, both diverge. So yes, the interval is open.

Therefore, the final answer is (2 - e, 2 + e). In boxed form, that&#x27;s \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.

**Final Answer**
The interval of convergence is \boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To determine the interval of convergence for the series \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k!(x-2)^k}{k^k} \), we use the Ratio Test. 

First, we consider the general term \( a_k = \frac{k!(x - 2)^k}{k^k} \). Applying the Ratio Test, we compute the limit:

\[
L = \lim_{k \to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \right|
\]

Simplifying the ratio \( \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \):

\[
\frac{(k+1)! (x - 2)^{k+1}}{(k+1)^{k+1}} \times \frac{k^k}{k! (x - 2)^k} = (k+1) \times (x - 2) \times \frac{k^k}{(k+1)^{k+1}}
\]

This simplifies further to:

\[
(x - 2) \times \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k
\]

Taking the limit as \( k \to \infty \), we use the known result \( \lim_{k \to \infty} \left( \frac{k}{k+1} \right)^k = \frac{1}{e} \). Thus, the limit \( L \) becomes:

\[
L = |x - 2| \times \frac{1}{e}
\]

For convergence, we need \( L &lt; 1 \):

\[
\frac{|x - 2|}{e} &lt; 1 \implies |x - 2| &lt; e
\]

This gives the radius of convergence as \( e \), centered at \( x = 2 \). The interval is \( (2 - e, 2 + e) \).

Next, we check the endpoints \( x = 2 \pm e \):

- For \( x = 2 + e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! e^k}{k^k} \). Using Stirling&#x27;s approximation, the terms behave like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which diverges.
- For \( x = 2 - e \), the series becomes \( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k! (-e)^k}{k^k} \). The terms alternate but their magnitude still behaves like \( \sqrt{2\pi k} \), which also diverges.

Thus, both endpoints diverge, confirming the interval of convergence is:

\[
\boxed{(2 - e, 2 + e)}

Reference Answer: We expand each product separately: \begin{align*}
(2x-5)(x+7) &amp;= 2x(x) + 2x(7) -5(x) -5(7)\\
&amp;=2x^2 +14x - 5x -35\\
&amp;= 2x^2 +9x - 35
\end{align*}and \begin{align*}
(x+5)(2x-1) &amp;=x(2x) + x(-1) +5(2x) + 5(-1)\\
&amp;=2x^2 -x + 10x -5\\
&amp;=2x^2 +9x - 5.
\end{align*}So, we have  \begin{align*}&amp;\ \ \ \ (2x-5)(x+7) - (x+5)(2x-1) \\&amp;= 2x^2+9x -35 - (2x^2 +9x -5) = \boxed{-30}.\end{align*}          </p>

Reference Answer: Let $\alpha = a + bi$ and $\gamma = c + di,$ where $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d$ are real numbers.  Then
\begin{align*}
f(1) &amp;= (4 + i) + \alpha + \gamma = (a + c + 4) + (b + d + 1)i, \\
f(i) &amp;= (4 + i)(-1) + \alpha i + \gamma = (-b + c - 4) + (a + d - 1)i.
\end{align*}Since $f(1)$ and $f(i)$ are both real, $b + d + 1 = 0$ and $a + d - 1 = 0,$ so $a = -d + 1$ and $b = -d - 1.$  Then
\begin{align*}
|\alpha| + |\gamma| &amp;= \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} + \sqrt{c^2 + d^2} \\

Reference Answer: Let $\alpha = a + bi$ and $\gamma = c + di,$ where $a,$ $b,$ $c,$ and $d$ are real numbers.  Then
\begin{align*}
f(1) &amp;= (4 + i) + \alpha + \gamma = (a + c + 4) + (b + d + 1)i, \\
f(i) &amp;= (4 + i)(-1) + \alpha i + \gamma = (-b + c - 4) + (a + d - 1)i.
\end{align*}Since $f(1)$ and $f(i)$ are both real, $b + d + 1 = 0$ and $a + d - 1 = 0,$ so $a = -d + 1$ and $b = -d - 1.$  Then

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to compute the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ, denoted as E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and figure out the structure of this set. Hmm, extensions of groups, right? I remember that in group theory, an extension of a group Q by a group N is a group G such that N is a normal subgroup of G and G/N is isomorphic to Q. So in this case, we&#x27;re looking at extensions where the quotient group is ℤ_p and the normal subgroup is ℤ. 

First, let me recall the general theory of group extensions. Extensions are classified by the second cohomology group H²(Q, N), where the action of Q on N is given by some module structure. But here, both N and Q are abelian groups, so the extensions should also be abelian. Wait, is that right? If both groups are abelian, then the extension is also abelian if the action is trivial? Maybe I need to be careful here.

Let me double-check. For abelian extensions, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N is isomorphic to Ext¹(Q, N). But in general, group extensions (not necessarily abelian) are classified by H²(Q, N). But since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, maybe we&#x27;re dealing with abelian extensions here. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify whether the extensions are required to be abelian, but since both groups are abelian, it&#x27;s possible that we are considering central extensions, which would be classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But I need to verify this.

Wait, Ext¹ is for abelian extensions, right? Let me recall: For abelian groups, the Ext functor in homological algebra classifies extensions. Specifically, Ext¹(Q, N) corresponds to the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N. So if we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions, then we need to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). However, if we consider arbitrary group extensions, then it would be H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But since ℤ is a trivial ℤ_p-module in the case of group cohomology? Wait, but ℤ_p acts on ℤ? How?

Wait, in group cohomology, the coefficients have to be a module over the group. So ℤ here would need to be a ℤ_p-module. If the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) would classify central extensions. But ℤ_p is cyclic of order p, and ℤ is torsion-free. So maybe the only action possible is trivial. Because any automorphism of ℤ is multiplication by ±1, but since ℤ_p is a cyclic group of order p, the action has to satisfy that applying the automorphism p times is the identity. But if we have multiplication by -1, then applying it p times would be multiplication by (-1)^p. If p is odd, this is -1, which is not the identity. If p=2, then it&#x27;s 1. So for p=2, a nontrivial action is possible, but for odd p, only the trivial action is possible. Wait, so maybe for p=2, ℤ could have a nontrivial ℤ_2 module structure where the generator acts as multiplication by -1. But ℤ is written additively, so the action would be x ↦ -x. Then, applying it twice would give the identity, which works for ℤ_2.

But in the problem statement, are we considering arbitrary extensions, or central extensions? The notation E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a bit ambiguous. In the literature, sometimes E(G, A) denotes equivalence classes of extensions of G by A, which could be nonabelian. But given that both ℤ_p and ℤ are abelian, if we consider abelian extensions, then the extensions would also be abelian groups. Alternatively, if we allow nonabelian extensions, even with abelian kernel and quotient, the set might be larger. But in general, I think that when dealing with abelian groups, people often consider abelian extensions, so perhaps the question is about abelian extensions. Let me check.

If we are to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ), then since Ext¹ is the derived functor, we can compute it using a projective resolution of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s recall that ℤ_p is isomorphic to ℤ / pℤ. So we can take the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, where the first map is multiplication by p. Applying the functor Hom(-, ℤ), we get the long exact sequence:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ, ℤ) → ...

But Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) is 0 because ℤ is torsion-free and ℤ_p is torsion. Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is isomorphic to ℤ, generated by the identity map. The map Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is induced by multiplication by p, so it&#x27;s also multiplication by p in Hom(ℤ, ℤ) ≅ ℤ. Therefore, the kernel is 0 and the cokernel is ℤ / pℤ. Then, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Wait, so this would mean that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ are in bijection with ℤ_p. Each element of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) corresponds to an abelian extension. So the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. But what do these extensions look like?

An abelian extension would be an abelian group G with a subgroup isomorphic to ℤ such that the quotient is isomorphic to ℤ_p. Since G is abelian and ℤ is a free abelian group, any such extension must split, right? Wait, no. If the extension splits, then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, but ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, whereas ℤ is torsion-free. Wait, but ℤ_p has torsion. Wait, but G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, so there is an exact sequence 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If the extension splits, then G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free because it has elements of order p. But the image of ℤ in G is a normal subgroup (since G is abelian) and the quotient is ℤ_p. However, if the extension doesn&#x27;t split, then G would have to be torsion-free? Wait, but how?

Wait, if G is an abelian group containing ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G is generated by the elements of ℤ and a preimage of the generator of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s suppose that ℤ is generated by x, and the generator of ℤ_p is y + ℤ. Then in G, we have that p(y + ℤ) = 0, so py ∈ ℤ. Therefore, py = nx for some integer n. Therefore, G is generated by x and y with relation py = nx. So depending on n, we can get different extensions. However, since n is an integer, but we can adjust y by multiples of x, so different n&#x27;s can give equivalent extensions. Specifically, if we replace y by y + kx, then p(y + kx) = py + pkx = nx + pkx = (n + pk)x. Therefore, n is determined modulo pℤ. Hence, the equivalence classes are parameterized by ℤ_p. So each extension is determined by an integer n modulo p, which tells us how many times we &quot;twist&quot; the generator y around the subgroup ℤ. Therefore, the equivalence classes are in bijection with ℤ_p. 

But in the case when n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in G, but G is generated by x and y with py = 0. Wait, but x has infinite order, and y has order p. Then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, which is the split extension. For other values of n, we get non-split extensions. For example, take n=1. Then G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x = py, so G is generated by y, with the relation that p^2 y = 0? Wait, no, wait. If py = x, then x is in the subgroup generated by y. Therefore, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, since x and y are related by py = x. Then, the quotient G / ℤ would be generated by y + ℤ, and since py = x ∈ ℤ, we have p(y + ℤ) = 0 in G / ℤ. So G / ℤ is cyclic of order p. But G itself is generated by y, and since x = py, then G is isomorphic to ℤ via y ↦ 1. But then G / ℤ would be ℤ / pℤ, which is correct. Wait, but then G is just ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ? Wait, that can&#x27;t be. If G is ℤ, then the subgroup would have to be pℤ, and the quotient would be ℤ_p. But that&#x27;s exactly the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0 where the first map is multiplication by p. So in this case, the extension is equivalent to the trivial extension? Wait, no. Wait, if n=1, then the extension is 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, but this is not split. Because in this case, G is ℤ, which can&#x27;t be written as a direct product of ℤ and ℤ_p. 

Wait, but if we have G being ℤ with the subgroup pℤ, then G is indeed just ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. So this is a non-split extension. But if we take n=0, then the extension would be split: 0 → ℤ → ℤ × ℤ_p → ℤ_p → 0. So the equivalence classes of extensions are in correspondence with n mod p, which is ℤ_p. So Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) of equivalence classes of abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

But hold on, earlier I thought that G can be generated by y with relation p^2 y = 0 if n=1, but that&#x27;s not correct. Because if we set py = x, which is in ℤ, then x is a generator of ℤ. So G is actually generated by y, and x is just py. Therefore, G is still ℤ, with y being a generator. Then the subgroup ℤ inside G is generated by x = py. Therefore, G is isomorphic to ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ. So indeed, this is the extension where ℤ is included as pℤ inside ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ / pℤ = ℤ_p. So all these extensions are actually isomorphic to ℤ, but with different embeddings of the subgroup. Wait, but in the category of abelian groups, how do we consider equivalence of extensions? 

Two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s a commutative diagram:

0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0

  ↓      ↓       ↓

0 → ℤ → G&#x27; → ℤ_p → 0

With the middle arrow being an isomorphism. So even if G and G&#x27; are both isomorphic to ℤ, but the embeddings of ℤ are different, then the extensions might not be equivalent. For example, if we have two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is coprime to p, then these would be inequivalent extensions. Wait, but in our case, the embeddings are determined by n mod p. For each n mod p, the embedding is multiplication by n. But if n is invertible mod p, does that give a different embedding? Wait, but in the case of n=1, the embedding is pℤ, and if n is coprime to p, say n=2, then the embedding is 2pℤ? Wait, no. Wait, in the extension corresponding to n, the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, and we have py = nx. So if n is coprime to p, then x is a multiple of py. For example, if n=1, x = py. If n=2, x = py, so 2x = p(2y). But 2 is invertible mod p if p is odd, so 2y would generate the same subgroup as y. Wait, maybe this is getting confused. 

Alternatively, maybe all these extensions are isomorphic as groups, but the specific embeddings are different. However, in the category of abelian groups, the automorphisms of ℤ are limited to multiplication by ±1. So if two embeddings differ by a automorphism of ℤ, then the extensions are equivalent. So if the embedding is given by multiplication by n, then if we can find an automorphism of ℤ (i.e., multiplication by ±1) such that n is sent to another integer, but since n is mod p, we can adjust n by ±1. But actually, the equivalence classes are determined by the module structure, so maybe the parameter n is considered up to automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. 

Wait, but according to the calculation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) being ℤ_p, the equivalence classes are in one-to-one correspondence with ℤ_p. So even though all the middle groups G might be isomorphic to ℤ or ℤ × ℤ_p, the actual extensions are considered different if the embeddings or the projections are different. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which is not isomorphic to ℤ. But when we have non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So actually, how come some extensions have G ≅ ℤ and others G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p? 

Wait, no, actually, in the case of the non-split extensions, G is always ℤ. Because if you have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0, then G has to be torsion-free if it&#x27;s abelian, because ℤ is torsion-free. But ℤ × ℤ_p has torsion, so it can&#x27;t be torsion-free. Therefore, only the non-split extensions result in G being ℤ, and the split extension would have G as ℤ × ℤ_p, which is impossible because that&#x27;s not torsion-free. Wait, this is a contradiction. 

Hold on, maybe all abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ must have G torsion-free. Therefore, the only possible extension is the non-split one. But according to our earlier calculation, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which suggests there are multiple extensions. But how can there be multiple non-isomorphic extensions? 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let&#x27;s consider the extensions. If G is abelian, torsion-free, and contains ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G must be isomorphic to ℤ. Because the only torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are ℤ and subgroups of ℚ. But if G is finitely generated (which it is, since it&#x27;s an extension of finite cyclic group by ℤ), then it must be isomorphic to ℤ. So actually, all such extensions have G ≅ ℤ, but with different embeddings. But in the category of abelian groups, two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s an isomorphism between the middle groups compatible with the embeddings and projections. 

So for example, take two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is an integer. Then these would define different extensions if k is not ±1. But since in abelian groups, automorphisms of ℤ are only ±1, the different multiples would lead to inequivalent extensions. But in our case, the extensions are parameterized by n mod p, so n can be 0,1,...,p-1. However, if n is non-zero, then the embedding is multiplication by n, but since n is invertible mod p or not? 

Wait, if we have an extension determined by n, where py = nx. If n is coprime to p, then there exists an integer m such that mn ≡ 1 mod p. Then, m py = mn x, which implies p(my) = x. Therefore, replacing y by my, we get the relation p(my) = x. Therefore, the embedding is multiplication by 1. So in this case, if n is coprime to p, the extension is equivalent to the one with n=1. If n is not coprime to p, say n and p share a common divisor d &gt;1, but since p is prime, this implies that n is a multiple of p, so n ≡ 0 mod p. Then, the extension is split. 

But wait, n is an integer, and the extensions are parameterized by n mod p. So if n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in the quotient, so G is ℤ × ℤ_p. But G must be abelian, so the only split extension is ℤ × ℤ_p. But earlier, I thought that if n ≡ 0 mod p, then the extension is split. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, so how can it be an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ? Wait, the exact sequence is 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If G is ℤ × ℤ_p, then the kernel is ℤ, embedded as (1,0), and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G has torsion, which is allowed? Wait, but the quotient is ℤ_p, which is torsion. So G can have torsion. Wait, but if the kernel is ℤ, which is torsion-free, the quotient is torsion, so G can have torsion. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which has torsion. However, in the non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So how does this work?

Wait, if G is ℤ, then the kernel is pℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G is torsion-free. So depending on whether the extension is split or not, G can be either torsion-free or have torsion. So the split extension is G = ℤ × ℤ_p, and the non-split extensions are G = ℤ. But then, if n ≠ 0 mod p, the extension is non-split, and G is ℤ. But there is only one non-split extension? But Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which would suggest there are p different extensions. 

This is confusing. Let me think again. 

We have Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So there are p equivalence classes of extensions. But how do these correspond to different groups G? For each n ∈ ℤ_p, we have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If n=0, then G is the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p. For n ≠0, G is a non-split extension. But if G is non-split, is it always isomorphic to ℤ? 

Wait, no. Let&#x27;s consider n=1. The group G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x is in the center (since G is abelian), and y has the relation that py = x. Then, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, with y as the generator. Then x = py, so the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, which is pℤ inside G. Then, the quotient G / pℤ is ℤ_p. So G is ℤ, and the extension is 0 → pℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0. 

But for n=2, if p ≠2, then the extension would be generated by x and y with py = 2x. Then, similar to the above, if we let z = y - x, then pz = py - px = 2x - px = (2 - p)x. Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, since 2 is invertible mod p (if p≠2), then there exists an integer m such that 2m ≡1 mod p. Then, replacing y with my, we get p(my) = m py = m*2x = (2m)x ≡ x mod p. Therefore, this extension is equivalent to the n=1 case. 

Therefore, for n coprime to p, the extensions are equivalent to the n=1 case. If n is not coprime to p, i.e., n=0 mod p, then it&#x27;s the split extension. Wait, but p is prime, so every n ≠0 mod p is coprime to p. Therefore, all non-zero n mod p give equivalent extensions? But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p. 

Hmm, so there must be a mistake in my reasoning here. Let&#x27;s go back to the computation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). Using the projective resolution:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → ℤ_p → 0

Applying Hom(-, ℤ), we get:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) --p*--&gt; Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → 0

Since Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) =0, this reduces to:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) →0

So the cokernel of multiplication by p is ℤ_p, hence Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, there are p distinct extensions. But if all non-zero extensions are isomorphic, then Ext¹ would be trivial or have fewer elements. So my previous reasoning that all non-zero n give equivalent extensions must be wrong. 

Wait, perhaps when considering equivalence of extensions, the automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p have to be taken into account. So two extensions are equivalent if there is a commutative diagram with automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. The automorphism group of ℤ is ℤ× = {±1}, and the automorphism group of ℤ_p is (ℤ_p)×, which has order p-1. Therefore, when considering equivalence classes of extensions, we might have to mod out by the action of these automorphism groups. However, in the calculation of Ext¹, we are considering extensions up to equivalence where the automorphisms of the kernel and quotient are not factored out. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s can be related by automorphisms of ℤ_p, in the Ext¹ calculation, these are considered distinct. Wait, no. Actually, in the definition of Ext¹, two extensions are equivalent if there exists a morphism between them that is the identity on N and Q. So automorphisms of N and Q are not considered. Therefore, even if two extensions differ by an automorphism of N or Q, they are still considered distinct in Ext¹. Therefore, in our case, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is indeed ℤ_p, with each element corresponding to a different extension. 

Therefore, even though for different n coprime to p, the groups G might be isomorphic, the extensions themselves are different because the way ℤ is embedded and the way the quotient maps are defined are different. So even if two extensions have isomorphic middle groups, if the embeddings and projections are different, they are considered non-equivalent extensions. 

So for example, take p=3. Then we have three extensions: n=0,1,2. For n=0, G=ℤ × ℤ_3. For n=1, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. For n=2, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 6ℤ? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, then the relation is 3y = 2x. If x is the generator of ℤ, then solving for x, we get x = (3/2)y. But since x must be an integer multiple of y, this is only possible if y is even. Wait, this seems problematic. 

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of group presentations. For each n, the group G is generated by x and y with the relation that py = nx. So for n=1, G is generated by x and y with 3y = x. Then, x is redundant as a generator because x = 3y, so G is generated by y, which is infinite cyclic. Therefore, G ≅ ℤ, with the subgroup generated by x = 3y. 

For n=2, G is generated by x and y with 3y = 2x. Then, we can write x = (3/2)y. But x must be an integer multiple of y, so this would require that y is divisible by 2. Let me set y = 2z. Then, x = 3z. Therefore, G is generated by z, with no relations, so G ≅ ℤ. The subgroup generated by x is 3z, so ℤ is embedded as 3ℤ in G. Wait, but this is the same as the n=1 case. So in this case, even though n=2, the group G is still ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. Therefore, the extensions corresponding to n=1 and n=2 are isomorphic? 

But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So where is the error here? 

Ah, perhaps in the equivalence of extensions, the automorphism of ℤ_p comes into play. If we have two extensions where the only difference is an automorphism of ℤ_p, then they would be considered equivalent. For example, if n=2 in the case p=3, then the quotient map G → ℤ_3 sends y to 1 + 3ℤ. But if we compose this with the automorphism of ℤ_3 that multiplies by 2, then the quotient map becomes y ↦ 2 + 3ℤ. Then, the relation becomes 3y = 2x, but after the automorphism, it&#x27;s equivalent to 3y = x. Therefore, the extensions n=1 and n=2 are equivalent under the automorphism of ℤ_p. 

But in the definition of Ext¹, when we compute Ext¹(Q, N), we consider extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are the identity. Therefore, if we allow automorphisms of Q, then different extensions could become equivalent. However, in the standard definition, Ext¹(Q, N) classifies extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are identities. Therefore, in our case, the different n&#x27;s correspond to different extensions even if they are related by automorphisms of Q. 

But in the example above, with p=3, n=1 and n=2 would give extensions that are isomorphic as groups, but the specific quotient maps differ by an automorphism of ℤ_p. Therefore, if we consider extensions up to isomorphism of the groups G, then there are only two isomorphism classes: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p and the non-split extension ℤ. But according to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, there are p equivalence classes of extensions. Therefore, the distinction is in the specific way the quotient is taken and the subgroup is embedded, not just the isomorphism class of G. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s may lead to isomorphic middle groups G, the extensions themselves are different because the maps are different. Hence, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has p elements, corresponding to the p different extensions. The structure of this set is therefore a cyclic group of order p, i.e., ℤ_p. 

But wait, is the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) actually a group? In the context of abelian extensions, yes, the Baer sum gives an abelian group structure on E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and it is isomorphic to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has the structure of the group ℤ_p. 

Alternatively, if we consider non-abelian extensions, but since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, all extensions are abelian. Wait, is that true? Let me check. If G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, then G is necessarily abelian? 

Suppose G is a group with a normal subgroup N ≅ ℤ and G/N ≅ ℤ_p. Is G necessarily abelian? 

Take an element y ∈ G such that the image of y in G/N generates G/N. Then, since G/N has order p, we have y^p ∈ N. Also, since N is abelian, the commutator [y, x] for x ∈ N must lie in N. But N is central in G? Not necessarily. Wait, if N is central, then G is abelian. But if N is not central, then G could be non-abelian. 

But ℤ is a cyclic group, so its automorphism group is ℤ× ≅ {±1}. Therefore, the action of y on N by conjugation must be an automorphism of N. Let’s suppose that conjugation by y acts as multiplication by k on N ≅ ℤ. Then, since y^p ∈ N, we have y^p x y^{-p} = x. But y^p is in N, which is abelian, so conjugation by y^p is trivial. Therefore, the automorphism induced by y must satisfy that its order divides p. But the automorphism group of ℤ is {1, -1}, so the only possibilities are that conjugation by y acts trivially (k=1) or as inversion (k=-1). If p is odd, then inversion has order 2, which does not divide p, unless p=2. Therefore, for odd p, the action must be trivial, so G is abelian. For p=2, inversion has order 2, which divides p=2, so non-abelian extensions are possible. 

Therefore, for p odd, all extensions are abelian, and E(ℤ_p, ℤ) = Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there could be non-abelian extensions. But since the problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t specify whether they are abelian or not, we might need to consider both cases. However, in the case of abelian extensions, as I computed before, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For non-abelian extensions when p=2, let&#x27;s see. 

For p=2, we can have a non-abelian extension where the generator of ℤ_2 acts by inversion on ℤ. Then, G would be the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, where ℤ_2 acts by inversion. This is a non-abelian group. So in this case, E(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have both abelian and non-abelian extensions. However, the question is about equivalence classes of extensions. In the category of groups, extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ), where ℤ is a ℤ_p-module. For p=2, ℤ can be a non-trivial module, so H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have more elements. 

But let&#x27;s compute H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). For group cohomology, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / N(A), where N is the norm map. Wait, when the action is non-trivial, the cohomology groups can be different. Let me recall that for cyclic groups, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / (1 - γ)A, where γ is a generator of ℤ_p. But if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A / pA. But in our case, for p=2, the action could be non-trivial. Let me consider p=2 and ℤ as a ℤ_2-module with the generator acting as -1. Then, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would be computed as follows. 

The group ℤ_2 acts on ℤ by inversion. The cohomology H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) can be computed using the Tate cohomology, which for cyclic groups is H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / (1 + γ)ℤ. Here, γ is the generator of ℤ_2 acting as -1 on ℤ. The norm map is 1 + γ, which acts as 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / 0 = ℤ^{ℤ_2}. But ℤ^{ℤ_2} is the set of elements fixed by the ℤ_2 action. Since the action is inversion, the fixed points are {x ∈ ℤ | -x = x} = {0}. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. Wait, but that would mean there are no non-abelian extensions? But we know that the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian extension. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recall that for group cohomology, H²(G, A) classifies extensions of G by A that are compatible with the module structure. If A is a trivial G-module, then H²(G, A) classifies central extensions. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(G, A) classifies extensions where the conjugation action of G on A matches the module structure. 

In the case of the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, the action is non-trivial (inversion), so this corresponds to a non-trivial ℤ_2-module structure on ℤ. Therefore, the extension is classified by an element of H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. However, according to the calculation above, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group. 

Wait, but maybe I need to use the fact that ℤ is a torsion-free module. Let me check another approach. For a cyclic group G = ℤ_p, the cohomology groups can be computed using the resolution:

... → ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] --N--&gt; ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] → ℤ → 0

where γ is a generator of G, and N is the norm element 1 + γ + ... + γ^{p-1}.

Then, applying Hom(-, A), we get the cochain complex:

0 → Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --N*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; ...

For H²(G, A), we need the second cohomology, which is the kernel of (1-γ)* modulo the image of N*. 

But Hom(ℤ[G], A) ≅ A, since ℤ[G] is free abelian of rank 1. Therefore, the complex becomes:

0 → A --1-γ--&gt; A --N--&gt; A --1-γ--&gt; ...

So H²(G, A) is the kernel of 1 - γ : A → A modulo the image of N : A → A. 

For our case, G=ℤ_2 acting on ℤ by inversion. Then, 1 - γ acts as 1 - (-1) = 2 on ℤ. The norm map N is 1 + γ = 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of multiplication by 2 on ℤ modulo the image of 0, which is 2ℤ / 0 ≅ 2ℤ. But H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) should be a torsion group, but 2ℤ is torsion-free. This suggests something is wrong. 

Wait, perhaps in group cohomology with coefficients in a non-trivial module, H² can be torsion even if the coefficients are torsion-free. But here, the calculation seems to give 2ℤ, which is incorrect. There must be an error in the setup. 

Alternatively, maybe I should use the Tate cohomology. For finite cyclic groups, the Tate cohomology groups are periodic with period 2. But Tate cohomology is defined for finite groups and modules, and in this case, H^2 would be isomorphic to H^0, which for Tate cohomology is A^G / N(A). For our case, A=ℤ with γ acting as -1. Then A^G = {0}, and N(A) = 0, so H^0 = 0. Hence, H² would also be 0. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. 

But this contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group extension. Therefore, perhaps the infinite dihedral group is not a valid extension in this context? Wait, no, the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian group which is an extension of ℤ_2 by ℤ. However, the action is non-trivial, but if we consider the extension as one where the base group is ℤ and the quotient is ℤ_2, then the group is ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2. However, in this case, the ℤ_2 is acting on ℤ, so the module structure is non-trivial. Therefore, such an extension is classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to the cohomology calculation, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which would imply that there are no such extensions. But this is a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the confusion arises because ℤ is not a projective ℤ[G]-module when G acts non-trivially. In the case of the infinite dihedral group, the extension is split, so it corresponds to a semi-direct product, which is classified by a 1-cocycle in H¹(G, Aut(N)), not H². Wait, group extensions with non-abelian kernel are classified by H¹(G, Aut(N)), but in our case, N=ℤ is abelian, so Aut(N)=ℤ×. However, for non-abelian extensions, the action is given by a homomorphism from G to Aut(N), and the extensions are classified by H²(G, Z(N)), where Z(N) is the center. But since N=ℤ is abelian, Z(N)=N, so H²(G, N) classifies extensions with the given action. 

But in our case, if the action is non-trivial, then the extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to our previous calculation, this is 0. However, the infinite dihedral group exists. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation. 

Wait, actually, the infinite dihedral group is a split extension, so it corresponds to the zero element in H²(G, N). But if H²(G, N) is trivial, then all extensions are split. However, the infinite dihedral group is split, so that&#x27;s consistent. Therefore, if H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0 with the non-trivial action, then all extensions with that action are split. But in our case, the only extensions are the split ones. But the infinite dihedral group is indeed a split extension. 

But then, for the trivial action, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Wait, let me recast the problem. If we consider the trivial action, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Because in that case, 1 - γ is the zero map, and N is multiplication by 2. So H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of 0 modulo image of 2, which is ℤ / 2ℤ. Therefore, if the action is trivial, there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. But if the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, so only the split extension exists. 

But the infinite dihedral group is a split extension with the non-trivial action, so it corresponds to the trivial element in H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with non-trivial action. Therefore, if we consider the action as part of the data, then when the action is non-trivial, all extensions are split. When the action is trivial, there are two extensions. 

But in our original problem, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ), the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify the action, but in the case of group extensions, the action is part of the data. However, if we fix the action to be trivial, then for p=2, we have H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, leading to two extensions. But for odd p, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, leading to p extensions. But earlier, we saw that when considering abelian extensions, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. However, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) (for trivial action) is also ℤ_p. 

Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify. For abelian extensions, where the action is trivial, the extensions are classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For group extensions (possibly non-abelian), with trivial action, they are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. But when the action is non-trivial, for p=2, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) =0. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether we are considering the action as part of the data or not. The problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which usually means that ℤ is the kernel and ℤ_p is the quotient. The action is then determined by the conjugation in the group. For abelian extensions, the action must be trivial. For non-abelian extensions, the action can be non-trivial if possible. 

But since ℤ is abelian, the conjugation action of G on ℤ must be trivial on ℤ, so the action factors through G/ℤ ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the action is a homomorphism ℤ_p → Aut(ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2. For p odd, there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from ℤ_p to ℤ_2 since p is odd and ℤ_p has no elements of order 2. Therefore, for p odd, the action must be trivial, so all extensions are abelian and classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there is a non-trivial homomorphism from ℤ_2 to Aut(ℤ), given by inversion. Therefore, extensions can have either trivial or non-trivial action. 

For p=2, if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, so there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ)=0, so only the split extension exists (the infinite dihedral group). Therefore, the total number of extensions is three? Wait, no. When considering group extensions with a given module structure, the action is fixed. Therefore, if we fix the action to be trivial, then there are two extensions. If we fix the action to be non-trivial, there&#x27;s one extension. But in the problem statement, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) without specifying the action, which could mean considering all possible actions. 

But in the literature, when the action is not specified, it&#x27;s usually assumed to be trivial. Alternatively, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might consider all possible extensions with any possible action. In that case, for p=2, we have extensions with trivial action (two) and extensions with non-trivial action (one). But I need to confirm this. 

However, given that the problem mentions &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which is somewhat ambiguous, but in the context of abelian groups, it&#x27;s more likely referring to abelian extensions. Moreover, if the problem is from a course on homological algebra or algebraic topology, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might denote the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions, which would be Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Therefore, taking into account that for each prime p, whether p=2 or odd, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, the structure of E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a cyclic group of order p. Hence, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ is in bijection with ℤ_p, and as a group under the Baer sum, it is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

Therefore, the final answer is that the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is in bijection with ℤ_p, and its structure is that of the cyclic group of order p.

**Final Answer**
The set of equivalence classes of extensions is the cyclic group of order \( p \), so \( E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \) is isomorphic to \( \boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p} \).
&lt;/think&gt;

To compute the equivalence classes of extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\), denoted as \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\), we consider both the group cohomology and homological algebra perspectives. 

1. **Abelian Extensions**: 
   - For abelian extensions, we use the Ext functor. Specifically, we need to compute \(\text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\).
   - Using the projective resolution of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\):
     \[
     0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{p} \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0
     \]
   - Applying \(\text{Hom}(-, \mathbb{Z})\) and considering the long exact sequence, we find:
     \[
     \text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_p
     \]
   - This result indicates that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\) are classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\).

2. **Group Cohomology**:
   - For non-abelian extensions, we consider group cohomology \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\). However, since \(\mathbb{Z}\) is a trivial \(\mathbb{Z}_p\)-module and \(\mathbb{Z}\) is torsion-free, the cohomology group \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) also leads to the same result for trivial actions.
   - For \(p = 2\), non-trivial actions (inversion) are possible, but they do not contribute additional equivalence classes as shown by cohomology calculations.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) of equivalence classes of extensions, whether considered as abelian extensions or group extensions with trivial action, is classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\). This structure holds for both odd and even primes \(p\).

Thus, the structure of the set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) is the cyclic group of order \(p\), leading to the final answer:

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to compute the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ, denoted as E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and figure out the structure of this set. Hmm, extensions of groups, right? I remember that in group theory, an extension of a group Q by a group N is a group G such that N is a normal subgroup of G and G/N is isomorphic to Q. So in this case, we&#x27;re looking at extensions where the quotient group is ℤ_p and the normal subgroup is ℤ. 

First, let me recall the general theory of group extensions. Extensions are classified by the second cohomology group H²(Q, N), where the action of Q on N is given by some module structure. But here, both N and Q are abelian groups, so the extensions should also be abelian. Wait, is that right? If both groups are abelian, then the extension is also abelian if the action is trivial? Maybe I need to be careful here.

Let me double-check. For abelian extensions, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N is isomorphic to Ext¹(Q, N). But in general, group extensions (not necessarily abelian) are classified by H²(Q, N). But since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, maybe we&#x27;re dealing with abelian extensions here. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify whether the extensions are required to be abelian, but since both groups are abelian, it&#x27;s possible that we are considering central extensions, which would be classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But I need to verify this.

Wait, Ext¹ is for abelian extensions, right? Let me recall: For abelian groups, the Ext functor in homological algebra classifies extensions. Specifically, Ext¹(Q, N) corresponds to the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N. So if we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions, then we need to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). However, if we consider arbitrary group extensions, then it would be H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But since ℤ is a trivial ℤ_p-module in the case of group cohomology? Wait, but ℤ_p acts on ℤ? How?

Wait, in group cohomology, the coefficients have to be a module over the group. So ℤ here would need to be a ℤ_p-module. If the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) would classify central extensions. But ℤ_p is cyclic of order p, and ℤ is torsion-free. So maybe the only action possible is trivial. Because any automorphism of ℤ is multiplication by ±1, but since ℤ_p is a cyclic group of order p, the action has to satisfy that applying the automorphism p times is the identity. But if we have multiplication by -1, then applying it p times would be multiplication by (-1)^p. If p is odd, this is -1, which is not the identity. If p=2, then it&#x27;s 1. So for p=2, a nontrivial action is possible, but for odd p, only the trivial action is possible. Wait, so maybe for p=2, ℤ could have a nontrivial ℤ_2 module structure where the generator acts as multiplication by -1. But ℤ is written additively, so the action would be x ↦ -x. Then, applying it twice would give the identity, which works for ℤ_2.

But in the problem statement, are we considering arbitrary extensions, or central extensions? The notation E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a bit ambiguous. In the literature, sometimes E(G, A) denotes equivalence classes of extensions of G by A, which could be nonabelian. But given that both ℤ_p and ℤ are abelian, if we consider abelian extensions, then the extensions would also be abelian groups. Alternatively, if we allow nonabelian extensions, even with abelian kernel and quotient, the set might be larger. But in general, I think that when dealing with abelian groups, people often consider abelian extensions, so perhaps the question is about abelian extensions. Let me check.

If we are to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ), then since Ext¹ is the derived functor, we can compute it using a projective resolution of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s recall that ℤ_p is isomorphic to ℤ / pℤ. So we can take the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, where the first map is multiplication by p. Applying the functor Hom(-, ℤ), we get the long exact sequence:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ, ℤ) → ...

But Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) is 0 because ℤ is torsion-free and ℤ_p is torsion. Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is isomorphic to ℤ, generated by the identity map. The map Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is induced by multiplication by p, so it&#x27;s also multiplication by p in Hom(ℤ, ℤ) ≅ ℤ. Therefore, the kernel is 0 and the cokernel is ℤ / pℤ. Then, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Wait, so this would mean that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ are in bijection with ℤ_p. Each element of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) corresponds to an abelian extension. So the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. But what do these extensions look like?

An abelian extension would be an abelian group G with a subgroup isomorphic to ℤ such that the quotient is isomorphic to ℤ_p. Since G is abelian and ℤ is a free abelian group, any such extension must split, right? Wait, no. If the extension splits, then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, but ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, whereas ℤ is torsion-free. Wait, but ℤ_p has torsion. Wait, but G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, so there is an exact sequence 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If the extension splits, then G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free because it has elements of order p. But the image of ℤ in G is a normal subgroup (since G is abelian) and the quotient is ℤ_p. However, if the extension doesn&#x27;t split, then G would have to be torsion-free? Wait, but how?

Wait, if G is an abelian group containing ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G is generated by the elements of ℤ and a preimage of the generator of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s suppose that ℤ is generated by x, and the generator of ℤ_p is y + ℤ. Then in G, we have that p(y + ℤ) = 0, so py ∈ ℤ. Therefore, py = nx for some integer n. Therefore, G is generated by x and y with relation py = nx. So depending on n, we can get different extensions. However, since n is an integer, but we can adjust y by multiples of x, so different n&#x27;s can give equivalent extensions. Specifically, if we replace y by y + kx, then p(y + kx) = py + pkx = nx + pkx = (n + pk)x. Therefore, n is determined modulo pℤ. Hence, the equivalence classes are parameterized by ℤ_p. So each extension is determined by an integer n modulo p, which tells us how many times we &quot;twist&quot; the generator y around the subgroup ℤ. Therefore, the equivalence classes are in bijection with ℤ_p. 

But in the case when n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in G, but G is generated by x and y with py = 0. Wait, but x has infinite order, and y has order p. Then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, which is the split extension. For other values of n, we get non-split extensions. For example, take n=1. Then G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x = py, so G is generated by y, with the relation that p^2 y = 0? Wait, no, wait. If py = x, then x is in the subgroup generated by y. Therefore, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, since x and y are related by py = x. Then, the quotient G / ℤ would be generated by y + ℤ, and since py = x ∈ ℤ, we have p(y + ℤ) = 0 in G / ℤ. So G / ℤ is cyclic of order p. But G itself is generated by y, and since x = py, then G is isomorphic to ℤ via y ↦ 1. But then G / ℤ would be ℤ / pℤ, which is correct. Wait, but then G is just ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ? Wait, that can&#x27;t be. If G is ℤ, then the subgroup would have to be pℤ, and the quotient would be ℤ_p. But that&#x27;s exactly the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0 where the first map is multiplication by p. So in this case, the extension is equivalent to the trivial extension? Wait, no. Wait, if n=1, then the extension is 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, but this is not split. Because in this case, G is ℤ, which can&#x27;t be written as a direct product of ℤ and ℤ_p. 

Wait, but if we have G being ℤ with the subgroup pℤ, then G is indeed just ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. So this is a non-split extension. But if we take n=0, then the extension would be split: 0 → ℤ → ℤ × ℤ_p → ℤ_p → 0. So the equivalence classes of extensions are in correspondence with n mod p, which is ℤ_p. So Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) of equivalence classes of abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

But hold on, earlier I thought that G can be generated by y with relation p^2 y = 0 if n=1, but that&#x27;s not correct. Because if we set py = x, which is in ℤ, then x is a generator of ℤ. So G is actually generated by y, and x is just py. Therefore, G is still ℤ, with y being a generator. Then the subgroup ℤ inside G is generated by x = py. Therefore, G is isomorphic to ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ. So indeed, this is the extension where ℤ is included as pℤ inside ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ / pℤ = ℤ_p. So all these extensions are actually isomorphic to ℤ, but with different embeddings of the subgroup. Wait, but in the category of abelian groups, how do we consider equivalence of extensions? 

Two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s a commutative diagram:

0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0

  ↓      ↓       ↓

0 → ℤ → G&#x27; → ℤ_p → 0

With the middle arrow being an isomorphism. So even if G and G&#x27; are both isomorphic to ℤ, but the embeddings of ℤ are different, then the extensions might not be equivalent. For example, if we have two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is coprime to p, then these would be inequivalent extensions. Wait, but in our case, the embeddings are determined by n mod p. For each n mod p, the embedding is multiplication by n. But if n is invertible mod p, does that give a different embedding? Wait, but in the case of n=1, the embedding is pℤ, and if n is coprime to p, say n=2, then the embedding is 2pℤ? Wait, no. Wait, in the extension corresponding to n, the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, and we have py = nx. So if n is coprime to p, then x is a multiple of py. For example, if n=1, x = py. If n=2, x = py, so 2x = p(2y). But 2 is invertible mod p if p is odd, so 2y would generate the same subgroup as y. Wait, maybe this is getting confused. 

Alternatively, maybe all these extensions are isomorphic as groups, but the specific embeddings are different. However, in the category of abelian groups, the automorphisms of ℤ are limited to multiplication by ±1. So if two embeddings differ by a automorphism of ℤ, then the extensions are equivalent. So if the embedding is given by multiplication by n, then if we can find an automorphism of ℤ (i.e., multiplication by ±1) such that n is sent to another integer, but since n is mod p, we can adjust n by ±1. But actually, the equivalence classes are determined by the module structure, so maybe the parameter n is considered up to automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. 

Wait, but according to the calculation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) being ℤ_p, the equivalence classes are in one-to-one correspondence with ℤ_p. So even though all the middle groups G might be isomorphic to ℤ or ℤ × ℤ_p, the actual extensions are considered different if the embeddings or the projections are different. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which is not isomorphic to ℤ. But when we have non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So actually, how come some extensions have G ≅ ℤ and others G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p? 

Wait, no, actually, in the case of the non-split extensions, G is always ℤ. Because if you have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0, then G has to be torsion-free if it&#x27;s abelian, because ℤ is torsion-free. But ℤ × ℤ_p has torsion, so it can&#x27;t be torsion-free. Therefore, only the non-split extensions result in G being ℤ, and the split extension would have G as ℤ × ℤ_p, which is impossible because that&#x27;s not torsion-free. Wait, this is a contradiction. 

Hold on, maybe all abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ must have G torsion-free. Therefore, the only possible extension is the non-split one. But according to our earlier calculation, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which suggests there are multiple extensions. But how can there be multiple non-isomorphic extensions? 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let&#x27;s consider the extensions. If G is abelian, torsion-free, and contains ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G must be isomorphic to ℤ. Because the only torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are ℤ and subgroups of ℚ. But if G is finitely generated (which it is, since it&#x27;s an extension of finite cyclic group by ℤ), then it must be isomorphic to ℤ. So actually, all such extensions have G ≅ ℤ, but with different embeddings. But in the category of abelian groups, two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s an isomorphism between the middle groups compatible with the embeddings and projections. 

So for example, take two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is an integer. Then these would define different extensions if k is not ±1. But since in abelian groups, automorphisms of ℤ are only ±1, the different multiples would lead to inequivalent extensions. But in our case, the extensions are parameterized by n mod p, so n can be 0,1,...,p-1. However, if n is non-zero, then the embedding is multiplication by n, but since n is invertible mod p or not? 

Wait, if we have an extension determined by n, where py = nx. If n is coprime to p, then there exists an integer m such that mn ≡ 1 mod p. Then, m py = mn x, which implies p(my) = x. Therefore, replacing y by my, we get the relation p(my) = x. Therefore, the embedding is multiplication by 1. So in this case, if n is coprime to p, the extension is equivalent to the one with n=1. If n is not coprime to p, say n and p share a common divisor d &gt;1, but since p is prime, this implies that n is a multiple of p, so n ≡ 0 mod p. Then, the extension is split. 

But wait, n is an integer, and the extensions are parameterized by n mod p. So if n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in the quotient, so G is ℤ × ℤ_p. But G must be abelian, so the only split extension is ℤ × ℤ_p. But earlier, I thought that if n ≡ 0 mod p, then the extension is split. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, so how can it be an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ? Wait, the exact sequence is 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If G is ℤ × ℤ_p, then the kernel is ℤ, embedded as (1,0), and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G has torsion, which is allowed? Wait, but the quotient is ℤ_p, which is torsion. So G can have torsion. Wait, but if the kernel is ℤ, which is torsion-free, the quotient is torsion, so G can have torsion. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which has torsion. However, in the non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So how does this work?

Wait, if G is ℤ, then the kernel is pℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G is torsion-free. So depending on whether the extension is split or not, G can be either torsion-free or have torsion. So the split extension is G = ℤ × ℤ_p, and the non-split extensions are G = ℤ. But then, if n ≠ 0 mod p, the extension is non-split, and G is ℤ. But there is only one non-split extension? But Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which would suggest there are p different extensions. 

This is confusing. Let me think again. 

We have Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So there are p equivalence classes of extensions. But how do these correspond to different groups G? For each n ∈ ℤ_p, we have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If n=0, then G is the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p. For n ≠0, G is a non-split extension. But if G is non-split, is it always isomorphic to ℤ? 

Wait, no. Let&#x27;s consider n=1. The group G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x is in the center (since G is abelian), and y has the relation that py = x. Then, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, with y as the generator. Then x = py, so the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, which is pℤ inside G. Then, the quotient G / pℤ is ℤ_p. So G is ℤ, and the extension is 0 → pℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0. 

But for n=2, if p ≠2, then the extension would be generated by x and y with py = 2x. Then, similar to the above, if we let z = y - x, then pz = py - px = 2x - px = (2 - p)x. Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, since 2 is invertible mod p (if p≠2), then there exists an integer m such that 2m ≡1 mod p. Then, replacing y with my, we get p(my) = m py = m*2x = (2m)x ≡ x mod p. Therefore, this extension is equivalent to the n=1 case. 

Therefore, for n coprime to p, the extensions are equivalent to the n=1 case. If n is not coprime to p, i.e., n=0 mod p, then it&#x27;s the split extension. Wait, but p is prime, so every n ≠0 mod p is coprime to p. Therefore, all non-zero n mod p give equivalent extensions? But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p. 

Hmm, so there must be a mistake in my reasoning here. Let&#x27;s go back to the computation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). Using the projective resolution:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → ℤ_p → 0

Applying Hom(-, ℤ), we get:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) --p*--&gt; Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → 0

Since Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) =0, this reduces to:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) →0

So the cokernel of multiplication by p is ℤ_p, hence Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, there are p distinct extensions. But if all non-zero extensions are isomorphic, then Ext¹ would be trivial or have fewer elements. So my previous reasoning that all non-zero n give equivalent extensions must be wrong. 

Wait, perhaps when considering equivalence of extensions, the automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p have to be taken into account. So two extensions are equivalent if there is a commutative diagram with automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. The automorphism group of ℤ is ℤ× = {±1}, and the automorphism group of ℤ_p is (ℤ_p)×, which has order p-1. Therefore, when considering equivalence classes of extensions, we might have to mod out by the action of these automorphism groups. However, in the calculation of Ext¹, we are considering extensions up to equivalence where the automorphisms of the kernel and quotient are not factored out. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s can be related by automorphisms of ℤ_p, in the Ext¹ calculation, these are considered distinct. Wait, no. Actually, in the definition of Ext¹, two extensions are equivalent if there exists a morphism between them that is the identity on N and Q. So automorphisms of N and Q are not considered. Therefore, even if two extensions differ by an automorphism of N or Q, they are still considered distinct in Ext¹. Therefore, in our case, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is indeed ℤ_p, with each element corresponding to a different extension. 

Therefore, even though for different n coprime to p, the groups G might be isomorphic, the extensions themselves are different because the way ℤ is embedded and the way the quotient maps are defined are different. So even if two extensions have isomorphic middle groups, if the embeddings and projections are different, they are considered non-equivalent extensions. 

So for example, take p=3. Then we have three extensions: n=0,1,2. For n=0, G=ℤ × ℤ_3. For n=1, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. For n=2, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 6ℤ? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, then the relation is 3y = 2x. If x is the generator of ℤ, then solving for x, we get x = (3/2)y. But since x must be an integer multiple of y, this is only possible if y is even. Wait, this seems problematic. 

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of group presentations. For each n, the group G is generated by x and y with the relation that py = nx. So for n=1, G is generated by x and y with 3y = x. Then, x is redundant as a generator because x = 3y, so G is generated by y, which is infinite cyclic. Therefore, G ≅ ℤ, with the subgroup generated by x = 3y. 

For n=2, G is generated by x and y with 3y = 2x. Then, we can write x = (3/2)y. But x must be an integer multiple of y, so this would require that y is divisible by 2. Let me set y = 2z. Then, x = 3z. Therefore, G is generated by z, with no relations, so G ≅ ℤ. The subgroup generated by x is 3z, so ℤ is embedded as 3ℤ in G. Wait, but this is the same as the n=1 case. So in this case, even though n=2, the group G is still ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. Therefore, the extensions corresponding to n=1 and n=2 are isomorphic? 

But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So where is the error here? 

Ah, perhaps in the equivalence of extensions, the automorphism of ℤ_p comes into play. If we have two extensions where the only difference is an automorphism of ℤ_p, then they would be considered equivalent. For example, if n=2 in the case p=3, then the quotient map G → ℤ_3 sends y to 1 + 3ℤ. But if we compose this with the automorphism of ℤ_3 that multiplies by 2, then the quotient map becomes y ↦ 2 + 3ℤ. Then, the relation becomes 3y = 2x, but after the automorphism, it&#x27;s equivalent to 3y = x. Therefore, the extensions n=1 and n=2 are equivalent under the automorphism of ℤ_p. 

But in the definition of Ext¹, when we compute Ext¹(Q, N), we consider extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are the identity. Therefore, if we allow automorphisms of Q, then different extensions could become equivalent. However, in the standard definition, Ext¹(Q, N) classifies extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are identities. Therefore, in our case, the different n&#x27;s correspond to different extensions even if they are related by automorphisms of Q. 

But in the example above, with p=3, n=1 and n=2 would give extensions that are isomorphic as groups, but the specific quotient maps differ by an automorphism of ℤ_p. Therefore, if we consider extensions up to isomorphism of the groups G, then there are only two isomorphism classes: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p and the non-split extension ℤ. But according to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, there are p equivalence classes of extensions. Therefore, the distinction is in the specific way the quotient is taken and the subgroup is embedded, not just the isomorphism class of G. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s may lead to isomorphic middle groups G, the extensions themselves are different because the maps are different. Hence, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has p elements, corresponding to the p different extensions. The structure of this set is therefore a cyclic group of order p, i.e., ℤ_p. 

But wait, is the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) actually a group? In the context of abelian extensions, yes, the Baer sum gives an abelian group structure on E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and it is isomorphic to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has the structure of the group ℤ_p. 

Alternatively, if we consider non-abelian extensions, but since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, all extensions are abelian. Wait, is that true? Let me check. If G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, then G is necessarily abelian? 

Suppose G is a group with a normal subgroup N ≅ ℤ and G/N ≅ ℤ_p. Is G necessarily abelian? 

Take an element y ∈ G such that the image of y in G/N generates G/N. Then, since G/N has order p, we have y^p ∈ N. Also, since N is abelian, the commutator [y, x] for x ∈ N must lie in N. But N is central in G? Not necessarily. Wait, if N is central, then G is abelian. But if N is not central, then G could be non-abelian. 

But ℤ is a cyclic group, so its automorphism group is ℤ× ≅ {±1}. Therefore, the action of y on N by conjugation must be an automorphism of N. Let’s suppose that conjugation by y acts as multiplication by k on N ≅ ℤ. Then, since y^p ∈ N, we have y^p x y^{-p} = x. But y^p is in N, which is abelian, so conjugation by y^p is trivial. Therefore, the automorphism induced by y must satisfy that its order divides p. But the automorphism group of ℤ is {1, -1}, so the only possibilities are that conjugation by y acts trivially (k=1) or as inversion (k=-1). If p is odd, then inversion has order 2, which does not divide p, unless p=2. Therefore, for odd p, the action must be trivial, so G is abelian. For p=2, inversion has order 2, which divides p=2, so non-abelian extensions are possible. 

Therefore, for p odd, all extensions are abelian, and E(ℤ_p, ℤ) = Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there could be non-abelian extensions. But since the problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t specify whether they are abelian or not, we might need to consider both cases. However, in the case of abelian extensions, as I computed before, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For non-abelian extensions when p=2, let&#x27;s see. 

For p=2, we can have a non-abelian extension where the generator of ℤ_2 acts by inversion on ℤ. Then, G would be the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, where ℤ_2 acts by inversion. This is a non-abelian group. So in this case, E(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have both abelian and non-abelian extensions. However, the question is about equivalence classes of extensions. In the category of groups, extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ), where ℤ is a ℤ_p-module. For p=2, ℤ can be a non-trivial module, so H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have more elements. 

But let&#x27;s compute H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). For group cohomology, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / N(A), where N is the norm map. Wait, when the action is non-trivial, the cohomology groups can be different. Let me recall that for cyclic groups, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / (1 - γ)A, where γ is a generator of ℤ_p. But if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A / pA. But in our case, for p=2, the action could be non-trivial. Let me consider p=2 and ℤ as a ℤ_2-module with the generator acting as -1. Then, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would be computed as follows. 

The group ℤ_2 acts on ℤ by inversion. The cohomology H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) can be computed using the Tate cohomology, which for cyclic groups is H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / (1 + γ)ℤ. Here, γ is the generator of ℤ_2 acting as -1 on ℤ. The norm map is 1 + γ, which acts as 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / 0 = ℤ^{ℤ_2}. But ℤ^{ℤ_2} is the set of elements fixed by the ℤ_2 action. Since the action is inversion, the fixed points are {x ∈ ℤ | -x = x} = {0}. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. Wait, but that would mean there are no non-abelian extensions? But we know that the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian extension. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recall that for group cohomology, H²(G, A) classifies extensions of G by A that are compatible with the module structure. If A is a trivial G-module, then H²(G, A) classifies central extensions. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(G, A) classifies extensions where the conjugation action of G on A matches the module structure. 

In the case of the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, the action is non-trivial (inversion), so this corresponds to a non-trivial ℤ_2-module structure on ℤ. Therefore, the extension is classified by an element of H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. However, according to the calculation above, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group. 

Wait, but maybe I need to use the fact that ℤ is a torsion-free module. Let me check another approach. For a cyclic group G = ℤ_p, the cohomology groups can be computed using the resolution:

... → ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] --N--&gt; ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] → ℤ → 0

where γ is a generator of G, and N is the norm element 1 + γ + ... + γ^{p-1}.

Then, applying Hom(-, A), we get the cochain complex:

0 → Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --N*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; ...

For H²(G, A), we need the second cohomology, which is the kernel of (1-γ)* modulo the image of N*. 

But Hom(ℤ[G], A) ≅ A, since ℤ[G] is free abelian of rank 1. Therefore, the complex becomes:

0 → A --1-γ--&gt; A --N--&gt; A --1-γ--&gt; ...

So H²(G, A) is the kernel of 1 - γ : A → A modulo the image of N : A → A. 

For our case, G=ℤ_2 acting on ℤ by inversion. Then, 1 - γ acts as 1 - (-1) = 2 on ℤ. The norm map N is 1 + γ = 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of multiplication by 2 on ℤ modulo the image of 0, which is 2ℤ / 0 ≅ 2ℤ. But H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) should be a torsion group, but 2ℤ is torsion-free. This suggests something is wrong. 

Wait, perhaps in group cohomology with coefficients in a non-trivial module, H² can be torsion even if the coefficients are torsion-free. But here, the calculation seems to give 2ℤ, which is incorrect. There must be an error in the setup. 

Alternatively, maybe I should use the Tate cohomology. For finite cyclic groups, the Tate cohomology groups are periodic with period 2. But Tate cohomology is defined for finite groups and modules, and in this case, H^2 would be isomorphic to H^0, which for Tate cohomology is A^G / N(A). For our case, A=ℤ with γ acting as -1. Then A^G = {0}, and N(A) = 0, so H^0 = 0. Hence, H² would also be 0. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. 

But this contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group extension. Therefore, perhaps the infinite dihedral group is not a valid extension in this context? Wait, no, the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian group which is an extension of ℤ_2 by ℤ. However, the action is non-trivial, but if we consider the extension as one where the base group is ℤ and the quotient is ℤ_2, then the group is ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2. However, in this case, the ℤ_2 is acting on ℤ, so the module structure is non-trivial. Therefore, such an extension is classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to the cohomology calculation, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which would imply that there are no such extensions. But this is a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the confusion arises because ℤ is not a projective ℤ[G]-module when G acts non-trivially. In the case of the infinite dihedral group, the extension is split, so it corresponds to a semi-direct product, which is classified by a 1-cocycle in H¹(G, Aut(N)), not H². Wait, group extensions with non-abelian kernel are classified by H¹(G, Aut(N)), but in our case, N=ℤ is abelian, so Aut(N)=ℤ×. However, for non-abelian extensions, the action is given by a homomorphism from G to Aut(N), and the extensions are classified by H²(G, Z(N)), where Z(N) is the center. But since N=ℤ is abelian, Z(N)=N, so H²(G, N) classifies extensions with the given action. 

But in our case, if the action is non-trivial, then the extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to our previous calculation, this is 0. However, the infinite dihedral group exists. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation. 

Wait, actually, the infinite dihedral group is a split extension, so it corresponds to the zero element in H²(G, N). But if H²(G, N) is trivial, then all extensions are split. However, the infinite dihedral group is split, so that&#x27;s consistent. Therefore, if H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0 with the non-trivial action, then all extensions with that action are split. But in our case, the only extensions are the split ones. But the infinite dihedral group is indeed a split extension. 

But then, for the trivial action, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Wait, let me recast the problem. If we consider the trivial action, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Because in that case, 1 - γ is the zero map, and N is multiplication by 2. So H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of 0 modulo image of 2, which is ℤ / 2ℤ. Therefore, if the action is trivial, there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. But if the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, so only the split extension exists. 

But the infinite dihedral group is a split extension with the non-trivial action, so it corresponds to the trivial element in H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with non-trivial action. Therefore, if we consider the action as part of the data, then when the action is non-trivial, all extensions are split. When the action is trivial, there are two extensions. 

But in our original problem, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ), the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify the action, but in the case of group extensions, the action is part of the data. However, if we fix the action to be trivial, then for p=2, we have H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, leading to two extensions. But for odd p, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, leading to p extensions. But earlier, we saw that when considering abelian extensions, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. However, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) (for trivial action) is also ℤ_p. 

Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify. For abelian extensions, where the action is trivial, the extensions are classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For group extensions (possibly non-abelian), with trivial action, they are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. But when the action is non-trivial, for p=2, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) =0. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether we are considering the action as part of the data or not. The problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which usually means that ℤ is the kernel and ℤ_p is the quotient. The action is then determined by the conjugation in the group. For abelian extensions, the action must be trivial. For non-abelian extensions, the action can be non-trivial if possible. 

But since ℤ is abelian, the conjugation action of G on ℤ must be trivial on ℤ, so the action factors through G/ℤ ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the action is a homomorphism ℤ_p → Aut(ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2. For p odd, there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from ℤ_p to ℤ_2 since p is odd and ℤ_p has no elements of order 2. Therefore, for p odd, the action must be trivial, so all extensions are abelian and classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there is a non-trivial homomorphism from ℤ_2 to Aut(ℤ), given by inversion. Therefore, extensions can have either trivial or non-trivial action. 

For p=2, if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, so there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ)=0, so only the split extension exists (the infinite dihedral group). Therefore, the total number of extensions is three? Wait, no. When considering group extensions with a given module structure, the action is fixed. Therefore, if we fix the action to be trivial, then there are two extensions. If we fix the action to be non-trivial, there&#x27;s one extension. But in the problem statement, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) without specifying the action, which could mean considering all possible actions. 

But in the literature, when the action is not specified, it&#x27;s usually assumed to be trivial. Alternatively, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might consider all possible extensions with any possible action. In that case, for p=2, we have extensions with trivial action (two) and extensions with non-trivial action (one). But I need to confirm this. 

However, given that the problem mentions &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which is somewhat ambiguous, but in the context of abelian groups, it&#x27;s more likely referring to abelian extensions. Moreover, if the problem is from a course on homological algebra or algebraic topology, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might denote the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions, which would be Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Therefore, taking into account that for each prime p, whether p=2 or odd, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, the structure of E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a cyclic group of order p. Hence, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ is in bijection with ℤ_p, and as a group under the Baer sum, it is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

Therefore, the final answer is that the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is in bijection with ℤ_p, and its structure is that of the cyclic group of order p.

**Final Answer**
The set of equivalence classes of extensions is the cyclic group of order \( p \), so \( E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \) is isomorphic to \( \boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p} \).
&lt;/think&gt;

To compute the equivalence classes of extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\), denoted as \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\), we consider both the group cohomology and homological algebra perspectives. 

1. **Abelian Extensions**: 
   - For abelian extensions, we use the Ext functor. Specifically, we need to compute \(\text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\).
   - Using the projective resolution of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\):
     \[
     0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{p} \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0
     \]
   - Applying \(\text{Hom}(-, \mathbb{Z})\) and considering the long exact sequence, we find:
     \[
     \text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_p
     \]
   - This result indicates that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\) are classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\).

2. **Group Cohomology**:
   - For non-abelian extensions, we consider group cohomology \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\). However, since \(\mathbb{Z}\) is a trivial \(\mathbb{Z}_p\)-module and \(\mathbb{Z}\) is torsion-free, the cohomology group \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) also leads to the same result for trivial actions.
   - For \(p = 2\), non-trivial actions (inversion) are possible, but they do not contribute additional equivalence classes as shown by cohomology calculations.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) of equivalence classes of extensions, whether considered as abelian extensions or group extensions with trivial action, is classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\). This structure holds for both odd and even primes \(p\).

Thus, the structure of the set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) is the cyclic group of order \(p\), leading to the final answer:

\[
\boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to compute the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ, denoted as E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and figure out the structure of this set. Hmm, extensions of groups, right? I remember that in group theory, an extension of a group Q by a group N is a group G such that N is a normal subgroup of G and G/N is isomorphic to Q. So in this case, we&#x27;re looking at extensions where the quotient group is ℤ_p and the normal subgroup is ℤ. 

First, let me recall the general theory of group extensions. Extensions are classified by the second cohomology group H²(Q, N), where the action of Q on N is given by some module structure. But here, both N and Q are abelian groups, so the extensions should also be abelian. Wait, is that right? If both groups are abelian, then the extension is also abelian if the action is trivial? Maybe I need to be careful here.

Let me double-check. For abelian extensions, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N is isomorphic to Ext¹(Q, N). But in general, group extensions (not necessarily abelian) are classified by H²(Q, N). But since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, maybe we&#x27;re dealing with abelian extensions here. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify whether the extensions are required to be abelian, but since both groups are abelian, it&#x27;s possible that we are considering central extensions, which would be classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But I need to verify this.

Wait, Ext¹ is for abelian extensions, right? Let me recall: For abelian groups, the Ext functor in homological algebra classifies extensions. Specifically, Ext¹(Q, N) corresponds to the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N. So if we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions, then we need to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). However, if we consider arbitrary group extensions, then it would be H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But since ℤ is a trivial ℤ_p-module in the case of group cohomology? Wait, but ℤ_p acts on ℤ? How?

Wait, in group cohomology, the coefficients have to be a module over the group. So ℤ here would need to be a ℤ_p-module. If the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) would classify central extensions. But ℤ_p is cyclic of order p, and ℤ is torsion-free. So maybe the only action possible is trivial. Because any automorphism of ℤ is multiplication by ±1, but since ℤ_p is a cyclic group of order p, the action has to satisfy that applying the automorphism p times is the identity. But if we have multiplication by -1, then applying it p times would be multiplication by (-1)^p. If p is odd, this is -1, which is not the identity. If p=2, then it&#x27;s 1. So for p=2, a nontrivial action is possible, but for odd p, only the trivial action is possible. Wait, so maybe for p=2, ℤ could have a nontrivial ℤ_2 module structure where the generator acts as multiplication by -1. But ℤ is written additively, so the action would be x ↦ -x. Then, applying it twice would give the identity, which works for ℤ_2.

But in the problem statement, are we considering arbitrary extensions, or central extensions? The notation E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a bit ambiguous. In the literature, sometimes E(G, A) denotes equivalence classes of extensions of G by A, which could be nonabelian. But given that both ℤ_p and ℤ are abelian, if we consider abelian extensions, then the extensions would also be abelian groups. Alternatively, if we allow nonabelian extensions, even with abelian kernel and quotient, the set might be larger. But in general, I think that when dealing with abelian groups, people often consider abelian extensions, so perhaps the question is about abelian extensions. Let me check.

If we are to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ), then since Ext¹ is the derived functor, we can compute it using a projective resolution of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s recall that ℤ_p is isomorphic to ℤ / pℤ. So we can take the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, where the first map is multiplication by p. Applying the functor Hom(-, ℤ), we get the long exact sequence:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ, ℤ) → ...

But Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) is 0 because ℤ is torsion-free and ℤ_p is torsion. Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is isomorphic to ℤ, generated by the identity map. The map Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is induced by multiplication by p, so it&#x27;s also multiplication by p in Hom(ℤ, ℤ) ≅ ℤ. Therefore, the kernel is 0 and the cokernel is ℤ / pℤ. Then, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Wait, so this would mean that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ are in bijection with ℤ_p. Each element of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) corresponds to an abelian extension. So the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. But what do these extensions look like?

An abelian extension would be an abelian group G with a subgroup isomorphic to ℤ such that the quotient is isomorphic to ℤ_p. Since G is abelian and ℤ is a free abelian group, any such extension must split, right? Wait, no. If the extension splits, then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, but ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, whereas ℤ is torsion-free. Wait, but ℤ_p has torsion. Wait, but G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, so there is an exact sequence 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If the extension splits, then G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free because it has elements of order p. But the image of ℤ in G is a normal subgroup (since G is abelian) and the quotient is ℤ_p. However, if the extension doesn&#x27;t split, then G would have to be torsion-free? Wait, but how?

Wait, if G is an abelian group containing ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G is generated by the elements of ℤ and a preimage of the generator of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s suppose that ℤ is generated by x, and the generator of ℤ_p is y + ℤ. Then in G, we have that p(y + ℤ) = 0, so py ∈ ℤ. Therefore, py = nx for some integer n. Therefore, G is generated by x and y with relation py = nx. So depending on n, we can get different extensions. However, since n is an integer, but we can adjust y by multiples of x, so different n&#x27;s can give equivalent extensions. Specifically, if we replace y by y + kx, then p(y + kx) = py + pkx = nx + pkx = (n + pk)x. Therefore, n is determined modulo pℤ. Hence, the equivalence classes are parameterized by ℤ_p. So each extension is determined by an integer n modulo p, which tells us how many times we &quot;twist&quot; the generator y around the subgroup ℤ. Therefore, the equivalence classes are in bijection with ℤ_p. 

But in the case when n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in G, but G is generated by x and y with py = 0. Wait, but x has infinite order, and y has order p. Then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, which is the split extension. For other values of n, we get non-split extensions. For example, take n=1. Then G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x = py, so G is generated by y, with the relation that p^2 y = 0? Wait, no, wait. If py = x, then x is in the subgroup generated by y. Therefore, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, since x and y are related by py = x. Then, the quotient G / ℤ would be generated by y + ℤ, and since py = x ∈ ℤ, we have p(y + ℤ) = 0 in G / ℤ. So G / ℤ is cyclic of order p. But G itself is generated by y, and since x = py, then G is isomorphic to ℤ via y ↦ 1. But then G / ℤ would be ℤ / pℤ, which is correct. Wait, but then G is just ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ? Wait, that can&#x27;t be. If G is ℤ, then the subgroup would have to be pℤ, and the quotient would be ℤ_p. But that&#x27;s exactly the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0 where the first map is multiplication by p. So in this case, the extension is equivalent to the trivial extension? Wait, no. Wait, if n=1, then the extension is 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, but this is not split. Because in this case, G is ℤ, which can&#x27;t be written as a direct product of ℤ and ℤ_p. 

Wait, but if we have G being ℤ with the subgroup pℤ, then G is indeed just ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. So this is a non-split extension. But if we take n=0, then the extension would be split: 0 → ℤ → ℤ × ℤ_p → ℤ_p → 0. So the equivalence classes of extensions are in correspondence with n mod p, which is ℤ_p. So Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) of equivalence classes of abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

But hold on, earlier I thought that G can be generated by y with relation p^2 y = 0 if n=1, but that&#x27;s not correct. Because if we set py = x, which is in ℤ, then x is a generator of ℤ. So G is actually generated by y, and x is just py. Therefore, G is still ℤ, with y being a generator. Then the subgroup ℤ inside G is generated by x = py. Therefore, G is isomorphic to ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ. So indeed, this is the extension where ℤ is included as pℤ inside ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ / pℤ = ℤ_p. So all these extensions are actually isomorphic to ℤ, but with different embeddings of the subgroup. Wait, but in the category of abelian groups, how do we consider equivalence of extensions? 

Two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s a commutative diagram:

0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0

  ↓      ↓       ↓

0 → ℤ → G&#x27; → ℤ_p → 0

With the middle arrow being an isomorphism. So even if G and G&#x27; are both isomorphic to ℤ, but the embeddings of ℤ are different, then the extensions might not be equivalent. For example, if we have two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is coprime to p, then these would be inequivalent extensions. Wait, but in our case, the embeddings are determined by n mod p. For each n mod p, the embedding is multiplication by n. But if n is invertible mod p, does that give a different embedding? Wait, but in the case of n=1, the embedding is pℤ, and if n is coprime to p, say n=2, then the embedding is 2pℤ? Wait, no. Wait, in the extension corresponding to n, the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, and we have py = nx. So if n is coprime to p, then x is a multiple of py. For example, if n=1, x = py. If n=2, x = py, so 2x = p(2y). But 2 is invertible mod p if p is odd, so 2y would generate the same subgroup as y. Wait, maybe this is getting confused. 

Alternatively, maybe all these extensions are isomorphic as groups, but the specific embeddings are different. However, in the category of abelian groups, the automorphisms of ℤ are limited to multiplication by ±1. So if two embeddings differ by a automorphism of ℤ, then the extensions are equivalent. So if the embedding is given by multiplication by n, then if we can find an automorphism of ℤ (i.e., multiplication by ±1) such that n is sent to another integer, but since n is mod p, we can adjust n by ±1. But actually, the equivalence classes are determined by the module structure, so maybe the parameter n is considered up to automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. 

Wait, but according to the calculation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) being ℤ_p, the equivalence classes are in one-to-one correspondence with ℤ_p. So even though all the middle groups G might be isomorphic to ℤ or ℤ × ℤ_p, the actual extensions are considered different if the embeddings or the projections are different. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which is not isomorphic to ℤ. But when we have non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So actually, how come some extensions have G ≅ ℤ and others G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p? 

Wait, no, actually, in the case of the non-split extensions, G is always ℤ. Because if you have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0, then G has to be torsion-free if it&#x27;s abelian, because ℤ is torsion-free. But ℤ × ℤ_p has torsion, so it can&#x27;t be torsion-free. Therefore, only the non-split extensions result in G being ℤ, and the split extension would have G as ℤ × ℤ_p, which is impossible because that&#x27;s not torsion-free. Wait, this is a contradiction. 

Hold on, maybe all abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ must have G torsion-free. Therefore, the only possible extension is the non-split one. But according to our earlier calculation, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which suggests there are multiple extensions. But how can there be multiple non-isomorphic extensions? 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let&#x27;s consider the extensions. If G is abelian, torsion-free, and contains ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G must be isomorphic to ℤ. Because the only torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are ℤ and subgroups of ℚ. But if G is finitely generated (which it is, since it&#x27;s an extension of finite cyclic group by ℤ), then it must be isomorphic to ℤ. So actually, all such extensions have G ≅ ℤ, but with different embeddings. But in the category of abelian groups, two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s an isomorphism between the middle groups compatible with the embeddings and projections. 

So for example, take two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is an integer. Then these would define different extensions if k is not ±1. But since in abelian groups, automorphisms of ℤ are only ±1, the different multiples would lead to inequivalent extensions. But in our case, the extensions are parameterized by n mod p, so n can be 0,1,...,p-1. However, if n is non-zero, then the embedding is multiplication by n, but since n is invertible mod p or not? 

Wait, if we have an extension determined by n, where py = nx. If n is coprime to p, then there exists an integer m such that mn ≡ 1 mod p. Then, m py = mn x, which implies p(my) = x. Therefore, replacing y by my, we get the relation p(my) = x. Therefore, the embedding is multiplication by 1. So in this case, if n is coprime to p, the extension is equivalent to the one with n=1. If n is not coprime to p, say n and p share a common divisor d &gt;1, but since p is prime, this implies that n is a multiple of p, so n ≡ 0 mod p. Then, the extension is split. 

But wait, n is an integer, and the extensions are parameterized by n mod p. So if n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in the quotient, so G is ℤ × ℤ_p. But G must be abelian, so the only split extension is ℤ × ℤ_p. But earlier, I thought that if n ≡ 0 mod p, then the extension is split. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, so how can it be an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ? Wait, the exact sequence is 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If G is ℤ × ℤ_p, then the kernel is ℤ, embedded as (1,0), and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G has torsion, which is allowed? Wait, but the quotient is ℤ_p, which is torsion. So G can have torsion. Wait, but if the kernel is ℤ, which is torsion-free, the quotient is torsion, so G can have torsion. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which has torsion. However, in the non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So how does this work?

Wait, if G is ℤ, then the kernel is pℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G is torsion-free. So depending on whether the extension is split or not, G can be either torsion-free or have torsion. So the split extension is G = ℤ × ℤ_p, and the non-split extensions are G = ℤ. But then, if n ≠ 0 mod p, the extension is non-split, and G is ℤ. But there is only one non-split extension? But Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which would suggest there are p different extensions. 

This is confusing. Let me think again. 

We have Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So there are p equivalence classes of extensions. But how do these correspond to different groups G? For each n ∈ ℤ_p, we have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If n=0, then G is the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p. For n ≠0, G is a non-split extension. But if G is non-split, is it always isomorphic to ℤ? 

Wait, no. Let&#x27;s consider n=1. The group G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x is in the center (since G is abelian), and y has the relation that py = x. Then, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, with y as the generator. Then x = py, so the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, which is pℤ inside G. Then, the quotient G / pℤ is ℤ_p. So G is ℤ, and the extension is 0 → pℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0. 

But for n=2, if p ≠2, then the extension would be generated by x and y with py = 2x. Then, similar to the above, if we let z = y - x, then pz = py - px = 2x - px = (2 - p)x. Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, since 2 is invertible mod p (if p≠2), then there exists an integer m such that 2m ≡1 mod p. Then, replacing y with my, we get p(my) = m py = m*2x = (2m)x ≡ x mod p. Therefore, this extension is equivalent to the n=1 case. 

Therefore, for n coprime to p, the extensions are equivalent to the n=1 case. If n is not coprime to p, i.e., n=0 mod p, then it&#x27;s the split extension. Wait, but p is prime, so every n ≠0 mod p is coprime to p. Therefore, all non-zero n mod p give equivalent extensions? But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p. 

Hmm, so there must be a mistake in my reasoning here. Let&#x27;s go back to the computation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). Using the projective resolution:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → ℤ_p → 0

Applying Hom(-, ℤ), we get:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) --p*--&gt; Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → 0

Since Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) =0, this reduces to:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) →0

So the cokernel of multiplication by p is ℤ_p, hence Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, there are p distinct extensions. But if all non-zero extensions are isomorphic, then Ext¹ would be trivial or have fewer elements. So my previous reasoning that all non-zero n give equivalent extensions must be wrong. 

Wait, perhaps when considering equivalence of extensions, the automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p have to be taken into account. So two extensions are equivalent if there is a commutative diagram with automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. The automorphism group of ℤ is ℤ× = {±1}, and the automorphism group of ℤ_p is (ℤ_p)×, which has order p-1. Therefore, when considering equivalence classes of extensions, we might have to mod out by the action of these automorphism groups. However, in the calculation of Ext¹, we are considering extensions up to equivalence where the automorphisms of the kernel and quotient are not factored out. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s can be related by automorphisms of ℤ_p, in the Ext¹ calculation, these are considered distinct. Wait, no. Actually, in the definition of Ext¹, two extensions are equivalent if there exists a morphism between them that is the identity on N and Q. So automorphisms of N and Q are not considered. Therefore, even if two extensions differ by an automorphism of N or Q, they are still considered distinct in Ext¹. Therefore, in our case, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is indeed ℤ_p, with each element corresponding to a different extension. 

Therefore, even though for different n coprime to p, the groups G might be isomorphic, the extensions themselves are different because the way ℤ is embedded and the way the quotient maps are defined are different. So even if two extensions have isomorphic middle groups, if the embeddings and projections are different, they are considered non-equivalent extensions. 

So for example, take p=3. Then we have three extensions: n=0,1,2. For n=0, G=ℤ × ℤ_3. For n=1, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. For n=2, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 6ℤ? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, then the relation is 3y = 2x. If x is the generator of ℤ, then solving for x, we get x = (3/2)y. But since x must be an integer multiple of y, this is only possible if y is even. Wait, this seems problematic. 

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of group presentations. For each n, the group G is generated by x and y with the relation that py = nx. So for n=1, G is generated by x and y with 3y = x. Then, x is redundant as a generator because x = 3y, so G is generated by y, which is infinite cyclic. Therefore, G ≅ ℤ, with the subgroup generated by x = 3y. 

For n=2, G is generated by x and y with 3y = 2x. Then, we can write x = (3/2)y. But x must be an integer multiple of y, so this would require that y is divisible by 2. Let me set y = 2z. Then, x = 3z. Therefore, G is generated by z, with no relations, so G ≅ ℤ. The subgroup generated by x is 3z, so ℤ is embedded as 3ℤ in G. Wait, but this is the same as the n=1 case. So in this case, even though n=2, the group G is still ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. Therefore, the extensions corresponding to n=1 and n=2 are isomorphic? 

But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So where is the error here? 

Ah, perhaps in the equivalence of extensions, the automorphism of ℤ_p comes into play. If we have two extensions where the only difference is an automorphism of ℤ_p, then they would be considered equivalent. For example, if n=2 in the case p=3, then the quotient map G → ℤ_3 sends y to 1 + 3ℤ. But if we compose this with the automorphism of ℤ_3 that multiplies by 2, then the quotient map becomes y ↦ 2 + 3ℤ. Then, the relation becomes 3y = 2x, but after the automorphism, it&#x27;s equivalent to 3y = x. Therefore, the extensions n=1 and n=2 are equivalent under the automorphism of ℤ_p. 

But in the definition of Ext¹, when we compute Ext¹(Q, N), we consider extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are the identity. Therefore, if we allow automorphisms of Q, then different extensions could become equivalent. However, in the standard definition, Ext¹(Q, N) classifies extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are identities. Therefore, in our case, the different n&#x27;s correspond to different extensions even if they are related by automorphisms of Q. 

But in the example above, with p=3, n=1 and n=2 would give extensions that are isomorphic as groups, but the specific quotient maps differ by an automorphism of ℤ_p. Therefore, if we consider extensions up to isomorphism of the groups G, then there are only two isomorphism classes: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p and the non-split extension ℤ. But according to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, there are p equivalence classes of extensions. Therefore, the distinction is in the specific way the quotient is taken and the subgroup is embedded, not just the isomorphism class of G. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s may lead to isomorphic middle groups G, the extensions themselves are different because the maps are different. Hence, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has p elements, corresponding to the p different extensions. The structure of this set is therefore a cyclic group of order p, i.e., ℤ_p. 

But wait, is the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) actually a group? In the context of abelian extensions, yes, the Baer sum gives an abelian group structure on E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and it is isomorphic to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has the structure of the group ℤ_p. 

Alternatively, if we consider non-abelian extensions, but since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, all extensions are abelian. Wait, is that true? Let me check. If G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, then G is necessarily abelian? 

Suppose G is a group with a normal subgroup N ≅ ℤ and G/N ≅ ℤ_p. Is G necessarily abelian? 

Take an element y ∈ G such that the image of y in G/N generates G/N. Then, since G/N has order p, we have y^p ∈ N. Also, since N is abelian, the commutator [y, x] for x ∈ N must lie in N. But N is central in G? Not necessarily. Wait, if N is central, then G is abelian. But if N is not central, then G could be non-abelian. 

But ℤ is a cyclic group, so its automorphism group is ℤ× ≅ {±1}. Therefore, the action of y on N by conjugation must be an automorphism of N. Let’s suppose that conjugation by y acts as multiplication by k on N ≅ ℤ. Then, since y^p ∈ N, we have y^p x y^{-p} = x. But y^p is in N, which is abelian, so conjugation by y^p is trivial. Therefore, the automorphism induced by y must satisfy that its order divides p. But the automorphism group of ℤ is {1, -1}, so the only possibilities are that conjugation by y acts trivially (k=1) or as inversion (k=-1). If p is odd, then inversion has order 2, which does not divide p, unless p=2. Therefore, for odd p, the action must be trivial, so G is abelian. For p=2, inversion has order 2, which divides p=2, so non-abelian extensions are possible. 

Therefore, for p odd, all extensions are abelian, and E(ℤ_p, ℤ) = Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there could be non-abelian extensions. But since the problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t specify whether they are abelian or not, we might need to consider both cases. However, in the case of abelian extensions, as I computed before, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For non-abelian extensions when p=2, let&#x27;s see. 

For p=2, we can have a non-abelian extension where the generator of ℤ_2 acts by inversion on ℤ. Then, G would be the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, where ℤ_2 acts by inversion. This is a non-abelian group. So in this case, E(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have both abelian and non-abelian extensions. However, the question is about equivalence classes of extensions. In the category of groups, extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ), where ℤ is a ℤ_p-module. For p=2, ℤ can be a non-trivial module, so H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have more elements. 

But let&#x27;s compute H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). For group cohomology, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / N(A), where N is the norm map. Wait, when the action is non-trivial, the cohomology groups can be different. Let me recall that for cyclic groups, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / (1 - γ)A, where γ is a generator of ℤ_p. But if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A / pA. But in our case, for p=2, the action could be non-trivial. Let me consider p=2 and ℤ as a ℤ_2-module with the generator acting as -1. Then, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would be computed as follows. 

The group ℤ_2 acts on ℤ by inversion. The cohomology H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) can be computed using the Tate cohomology, which for cyclic groups is H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / (1 + γ)ℤ. Here, γ is the generator of ℤ_2 acting as -1 on ℤ. The norm map is 1 + γ, which acts as 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / 0 = ℤ^{ℤ_2}. But ℤ^{ℤ_2} is the set of elements fixed by the ℤ_2 action. Since the action is inversion, the fixed points are {x ∈ ℤ | -x = x} = {0}. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. Wait, but that would mean there are no non-abelian extensions? But we know that the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian extension. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recall that for group cohomology, H²(G, A) classifies extensions of G by A that are compatible with the module structure. If A is a trivial G-module, then H²(G, A) classifies central extensions. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(G, A) classifies extensions where the conjugation action of G on A matches the module structure. 

In the case of the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, the action is non-trivial (inversion), so this corresponds to a non-trivial ℤ_2-module structure on ℤ. Therefore, the extension is classified by an element of H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. However, according to the calculation above, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group. 

Wait, but maybe I need to use the fact that ℤ is a torsion-free module. Let me check another approach. For a cyclic group G = ℤ_p, the cohomology groups can be computed using the resolution:

... → ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] --N--&gt; ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] → ℤ → 0

where γ is a generator of G, and N is the norm element 1 + γ + ... + γ^{p-1}.

Then, applying Hom(-, A), we get the cochain complex:

0 → Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --N*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; ...

For H²(G, A), we need the second cohomology, which is the kernel of (1-γ)* modulo the image of N*. 

But Hom(ℤ[G], A) ≅ A, since ℤ[G] is free abelian of rank 1. Therefore, the complex becomes:

0 → A --1-γ--&gt; A --N--&gt; A --1-γ--&gt; ...

So H²(G, A) is the kernel of 1 - γ : A → A modulo the image of N : A → A. 

For our case, G=ℤ_2 acting on ℤ by inversion. Then, 1 - γ acts as 1 - (-1) = 2 on ℤ. The norm map N is 1 + γ = 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of multiplication by 2 on ℤ modulo the image of 0, which is 2ℤ / 0 ≅ 2ℤ. But H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) should be a torsion group, but 2ℤ is torsion-free. This suggests something is wrong. 

Wait, perhaps in group cohomology with coefficients in a non-trivial module, H² can be torsion even if the coefficients are torsion-free. But here, the calculation seems to give 2ℤ, which is incorrect. There must be an error in the setup. 

Alternatively, maybe I should use the Tate cohomology. For finite cyclic groups, the Tate cohomology groups are periodic with period 2. But Tate cohomology is defined for finite groups and modules, and in this case, H^2 would be isomorphic to H^0, which for Tate cohomology is A^G / N(A). For our case, A=ℤ with γ acting as -1. Then A^G = {0}, and N(A) = 0, so H^0 = 0. Hence, H² would also be 0. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. 

But this contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group extension. Therefore, perhaps the infinite dihedral group is not a valid extension in this context? Wait, no, the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian group which is an extension of ℤ_2 by ℤ. However, the action is non-trivial, but if we consider the extension as one where the base group is ℤ and the quotient is ℤ_2, then the group is ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2. However, in this case, the ℤ_2 is acting on ℤ, so the module structure is non-trivial. Therefore, such an extension is classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to the cohomology calculation, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which would imply that there are no such extensions. But this is a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the confusion arises because ℤ is not a projective ℤ[G]-module when G acts non-trivially. In the case of the infinite dihedral group, the extension is split, so it corresponds to a semi-direct product, which is classified by a 1-cocycle in H¹(G, Aut(N)), not H². Wait, group extensions with non-abelian kernel are classified by H¹(G, Aut(N)), but in our case, N=ℤ is abelian, so Aut(N)=ℤ×. However, for non-abelian extensions, the action is given by a homomorphism from G to Aut(N), and the extensions are classified by H²(G, Z(N)), where Z(N) is the center. But since N=ℤ is abelian, Z(N)=N, so H²(G, N) classifies extensions with the given action. 

But in our case, if the action is non-trivial, then the extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to our previous calculation, this is 0. However, the infinite dihedral group exists. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation. 

Wait, actually, the infinite dihedral group is a split extension, so it corresponds to the zero element in H²(G, N). But if H²(G, N) is trivial, then all extensions are split. However, the infinite dihedral group is split, so that&#x27;s consistent. Therefore, if H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0 with the non-trivial action, then all extensions with that action are split. But in our case, the only extensions are the split ones. But the infinite dihedral group is indeed a split extension. 

But then, for the trivial action, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Wait, let me recast the problem. If we consider the trivial action, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Because in that case, 1 - γ is the zero map, and N is multiplication by 2. So H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of 0 modulo image of 2, which is ℤ / 2ℤ. Therefore, if the action is trivial, there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. But if the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, so only the split extension exists. 

But the infinite dihedral group is a split extension with the non-trivial action, so it corresponds to the trivial element in H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with non-trivial action. Therefore, if we consider the action as part of the data, then when the action is non-trivial, all extensions are split. When the action is trivial, there are two extensions. 

But in our original problem, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ), the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify the action, but in the case of group extensions, the action is part of the data. However, if we fix the action to be trivial, then for p=2, we have H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, leading to two extensions. But for odd p, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, leading to p extensions. But earlier, we saw that when considering abelian extensions, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. However, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) (for trivial action) is also ℤ_p. 

Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify. For abelian extensions, where the action is trivial, the extensions are classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For group extensions (possibly non-abelian), with trivial action, they are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. But when the action is non-trivial, for p=2, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) =0. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether we are considering the action as part of the data or not. The problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which usually means that ℤ is the kernel and ℤ_p is the quotient. The action is then determined by the conjugation in the group. For abelian extensions, the action must be trivial. For non-abelian extensions, the action can be non-trivial if possible. 

But since ℤ is abelian, the conjugation action of G on ℤ must be trivial on ℤ, so the action factors through G/ℤ ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the action is a homomorphism ℤ_p → Aut(ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2. For p odd, there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from ℤ_p to ℤ_2 since p is odd and ℤ_p has no elements of order 2. Therefore, for p odd, the action must be trivial, so all extensions are abelian and classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there is a non-trivial homomorphism from ℤ_2 to Aut(ℤ), given by inversion. Therefore, extensions can have either trivial or non-trivial action. 

For p=2, if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, so there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ)=0, so only the split extension exists (the infinite dihedral group). Therefore, the total number of extensions is three? Wait, no. When considering group extensions with a given module structure, the action is fixed. Therefore, if we fix the action to be trivial, then there are two extensions. If we fix the action to be non-trivial, there&#x27;s one extension. But in the problem statement, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) without specifying the action, which could mean considering all possible actions. 

But in the literature, when the action is not specified, it&#x27;s usually assumed to be trivial. Alternatively, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might consider all possible extensions with any possible action. In that case, for p=2, we have extensions with trivial action (two) and extensions with non-trivial action (one). But I need to confirm this. 

However, given that the problem mentions &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which is somewhat ambiguous, but in the context of abelian groups, it&#x27;s more likely referring to abelian extensions. Moreover, if the problem is from a course on homological algebra or algebraic topology, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might denote the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions, which would be Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Therefore, taking into account that for each prime p, whether p=2 or odd, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, the structure of E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a cyclic group of order p. Hence, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ is in bijection with ℤ_p, and as a group under the Baer sum, it is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

Therefore, the final answer is that the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is in bijection with ℤ_p, and its structure is that of the cyclic group of order p.

**Final Answer**
The set of equivalence classes of extensions is the cyclic group of order \( p \), so \( E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \) is isomorphic to \( \boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p} \).
&lt;/think&gt;

To compute the equivalence classes of extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\), denoted as \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\), we consider both the group cohomology and homological algebra perspectives. 

1. **Abelian Extensions**: 
   - For abelian extensions, we use the Ext functor. Specifically, we need to compute \(\text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\).
   - Using the projective resolution of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\):
     \[
     0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{p} \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0
     \]
   - Applying \(\text{Hom}(-, \mathbb{Z})\) and considering the long exact sequence, we find:
     \[
     \text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_p
     \]
   - This result indicates that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\) are classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\).

2. **Group Cohomology**:
   - For non-abelian extensions, we consider group cohomology \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\). However, since \(\mathbb{Z}\) is a trivial \(\mathbb{Z}_p\)-module and \(\mathbb{Z}\) is torsion-free, the cohomology group \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) also leads to the same result for trivial actions.
   - For \(p = 2\), non-trivial actions (inversion) are possible, but they do not contribute additional equivalence classes as shown by cohomology calculations.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) of equivalence classes of extensions, whether considered as abelian extensions or group extensions with trivial action, is classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\). This structure holds for both odd and even primes \(p\).

Thus, the structure of the set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) is the cyclic group of order \(p\), leading to the final answer:

\boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to compute the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ, denoted as E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and figure out the structure of this set. Hmm, extensions of groups, right? I remember that in group theory, an extension of a group Q by a group N is a group G such that N is a normal subgroup of G and G/N is isomorphic to Q. So in this case, we&#x27;re looking at extensions where the quotient group is ℤ_p and the normal subgroup is ℤ. 

First, let me recall the general theory of group extensions. Extensions are classified by the second cohomology group H²(Q, N), where the action of Q on N is given by some module structure. But here, both N and Q are abelian groups, so the extensions should also be abelian. Wait, is that right? If both groups are abelian, then the extension is also abelian if the action is trivial? Maybe I need to be careful here.

Let me double-check. For abelian extensions, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N is isomorphic to Ext¹(Q, N). But in general, group extensions (not necessarily abelian) are classified by H²(Q, N). But since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, maybe we&#x27;re dealing with abelian extensions here. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify whether the extensions are required to be abelian, but since both groups are abelian, it&#x27;s possible that we are considering central extensions, which would be classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But I need to verify this.

Wait, Ext¹ is for abelian extensions, right? Let me recall: For abelian groups, the Ext functor in homological algebra classifies extensions. Specifically, Ext¹(Q, N) corresponds to the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N. So if we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions, then we need to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). However, if we consider arbitrary group extensions, then it would be H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But since ℤ is a trivial ℤ_p-module in the case of group cohomology? Wait, but ℤ_p acts on ℤ? How?

Wait, in group cohomology, the coefficients have to be a module over the group. So ℤ here would need to be a ℤ_p-module. If the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) would classify central extensions. But ℤ_p is cyclic of order p, and ℤ is torsion-free. So maybe the only action possible is trivial. Because any automorphism of ℤ is multiplication by ±1, but since ℤ_p is a cyclic group of order p, the action has to satisfy that applying the automorphism p times is the identity. But if we have multiplication by -1, then applying it p times would be multiplication by (-1)^p. If p is odd, this is -1, which is not the identity. If p=2, then it&#x27;s 1. So for p=2, a nontrivial action is possible, but for odd p, only the trivial action is possible. Wait, so maybe for p=2, ℤ could have a nontrivial ℤ_2 module structure where the generator acts as multiplication by -1. But ℤ is written additively, so the action would be x ↦ -x. Then, applying it twice would give the identity, which works for ℤ_2.

But in the problem statement, are we considering arbitrary extensions, or central extensions? The notation E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a bit ambiguous. In the literature, sometimes E(G, A) denotes equivalence classes of extensions of G by A, which could be nonabelian. But given that both ℤ_p and ℤ are abelian, if we consider abelian extensions, then the extensions would also be abelian groups. Alternatively, if we allow nonabelian extensions, even with abelian kernel and quotient, the set might be larger. But in general, I think that when dealing with abelian groups, people often consider abelian extensions, so perhaps the question is about abelian extensions. Let me check.

If we are to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ), then since Ext¹ is the derived functor, we can compute it using a projective resolution of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s recall that ℤ_p is isomorphic to ℤ / pℤ. So we can take the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, where the first map is multiplication by p. Applying the functor Hom(-, ℤ), we get the long exact sequence:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ, ℤ) → ...

But Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) is 0 because ℤ is torsion-free and ℤ_p is torsion. Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is isomorphic to ℤ, generated by the identity map. The map Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is induced by multiplication by p, so it&#x27;s also multiplication by p in Hom(ℤ, ℤ) ≅ ℤ. Therefore, the kernel is 0 and the cokernel is ℤ / pℤ. Then, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Wait, so this would mean that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ are in bijection with ℤ_p. Each element of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) corresponds to an abelian extension. So the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. But what do these extensions look like?

An abelian extension would be an abelian group G with a subgroup isomorphic to ℤ such that the quotient is isomorphic to ℤ_p. Since G is abelian and ℤ is a free abelian group, any such extension must split, right? Wait, no. If the extension splits, then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, but ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, whereas ℤ is torsion-free. Wait, but ℤ_p has torsion. Wait, but G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, so there is an exact sequence 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If the extension splits, then G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free because it has elements of order p. But the image of ℤ in G is a normal subgroup (since G is abelian) and the quotient is ℤ_p. However, if the extension doesn&#x27;t split, then G would have to be torsion-free? Wait, but how?

Wait, if G is an abelian group containing ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G is generated by the elements of ℤ and a preimage of the generator of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s suppose that ℤ is generated by x, and the generator of ℤ_p is y + ℤ. Then in G, we have that p(y + ℤ) = 0, so py ∈ ℤ. Therefore, py = nx for some integer n. Therefore, G is generated by x and y with relation py = nx. So depending on n, we can get different extensions. However, since n is an integer, but we can adjust y by multiples of x, so different n&#x27;s can give equivalent extensions. Specifically, if we replace y by y + kx, then p(y + kx) = py + pkx = nx + pkx = (n + pk)x. Therefore, n is determined modulo pℤ. Hence, the equivalence classes are parameterized by ℤ_p. So each extension is determined by an integer n modulo p, which tells us how many times we &quot;twist&quot; the generator y around the subgroup ℤ. Therefore, the equivalence classes are in bijection with ℤ_p. 

But in the case when n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in G, but G is generated by x and y with py = 0. Wait, but x has infinite order, and y has order p. Then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, which is the split extension. For other values of n, we get non-split extensions. For example, take n=1. Then G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x = py, so G is generated by y, with the relation that p^2 y = 0? Wait, no, wait. If py = x, then x is in the subgroup generated by y. Therefore, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, since x and y are related by py = x. Then, the quotient G / ℤ would be generated by y + ℤ, and since py = x ∈ ℤ, we have p(y + ℤ) = 0 in G / ℤ. So G / ℤ is cyclic of order p. But G itself is generated by y, and since x = py, then G is isomorphic to ℤ via y ↦ 1. But then G / ℤ would be ℤ / pℤ, which is correct. Wait, but then G is just ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ? Wait, that can&#x27;t be. If G is ℤ, then the subgroup would have to be pℤ, and the quotient would be ℤ_p. But that&#x27;s exactly the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0 where the first map is multiplication by p. So in this case, the extension is equivalent to the trivial extension? Wait, no. Wait, if n=1, then the extension is 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, but this is not split. Because in this case, G is ℤ, which can&#x27;t be written as a direct product of ℤ and ℤ_p. 

Wait, but if we have G being ℤ with the subgroup pℤ, then G is indeed just ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. So this is a non-split extension. But if we take n=0, then the extension would be split: 0 → ℤ → ℤ × ℤ_p → ℤ_p → 0. So the equivalence classes of extensions are in correspondence with n mod p, which is ℤ_p. So Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) of equivalence classes of abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

But hold on, earlier I thought that G can be generated by y with relation p^2 y = 0 if n=1, but that&#x27;s not correct. Because if we set py = x, which is in ℤ, then x is a generator of ℤ. So G is actually generated by y, and x is just py. Therefore, G is still ℤ, with y being a generator. Then the subgroup ℤ inside G is generated by x = py. Therefore, G is isomorphic to ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ. So indeed, this is the extension where ℤ is included as pℤ inside ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ / pℤ = ℤ_p. So all these extensions are actually isomorphic to ℤ, but with different embeddings of the subgroup. Wait, but in the category of abelian groups, how do we consider equivalence of extensions? 

Two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s a commutative diagram:

0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0

  ↓      ↓       ↓

0 → ℤ → G&#x27; → ℤ_p → 0

With the middle arrow being an isomorphism. So even if G and G&#x27; are both isomorphic to ℤ, but the embeddings of ℤ are different, then the extensions might not be equivalent. For example, if we have two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is coprime to p, then these would be inequivalent extensions. Wait, but in our case, the embeddings are determined by n mod p. For each n mod p, the embedding is multiplication by n. But if n is invertible mod p, does that give a different embedding? Wait, but in the case of n=1, the embedding is pℤ, and if n is coprime to p, say n=2, then the embedding is 2pℤ? Wait, no. Wait, in the extension corresponding to n, the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, and we have py = nx. So if n is coprime to p, then x is a multiple of py. For example, if n=1, x = py. If n=2, x = py, so 2x = p(2y). But 2 is invertible mod p if p is odd, so 2y would generate the same subgroup as y. Wait, maybe this is getting confused. 

Alternatively, maybe all these extensions are isomorphic as groups, but the specific embeddings are different. However, in the category of abelian groups, the automorphisms of ℤ are limited to multiplication by ±1. So if two embeddings differ by a automorphism of ℤ, then the extensions are equivalent. So if the embedding is given by multiplication by n, then if we can find an automorphism of ℤ (i.e., multiplication by ±1) such that n is sent to another integer, but since n is mod p, we can adjust n by ±1. But actually, the equivalence classes are determined by the module structure, so maybe the parameter n is considered up to automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. 

Wait, but according to the calculation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) being ℤ_p, the equivalence classes are in one-to-one correspondence with ℤ_p. So even though all the middle groups G might be isomorphic to ℤ or ℤ × ℤ_p, the actual extensions are considered different if the embeddings or the projections are different. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which is not isomorphic to ℤ. But when we have non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So actually, how come some extensions have G ≅ ℤ and others G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p? 

Wait, no, actually, in the case of the non-split extensions, G is always ℤ. Because if you have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0, then G has to be torsion-free if it&#x27;s abelian, because ℤ is torsion-free. But ℤ × ℤ_p has torsion, so it can&#x27;t be torsion-free. Therefore, only the non-split extensions result in G being ℤ, and the split extension would have G as ℤ × ℤ_p, which is impossible because that&#x27;s not torsion-free. Wait, this is a contradiction. 

Hold on, maybe all abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ must have G torsion-free. Therefore, the only possible extension is the non-split one. But according to our earlier calculation, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which suggests there are multiple extensions. But how can there be multiple non-isomorphic extensions? 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let&#x27;s consider the extensions. If G is abelian, torsion-free, and contains ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G must be isomorphic to ℤ. Because the only torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are ℤ and subgroups of ℚ. But if G is finitely generated (which it is, since it&#x27;s an extension of finite cyclic group by ℤ), then it must be isomorphic to ℤ. So actually, all such extensions have G ≅ ℤ, but with different embeddings. But in the category of abelian groups, two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s an isomorphism between the middle groups compatible with the embeddings and projections. 

So for example, take two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is an integer. Then these would define different extensions if k is not ±1. But since in abelian groups, automorphisms of ℤ are only ±1, the different multiples would lead to inequivalent extensions. But in our case, the extensions are parameterized by n mod p, so n can be 0,1,...,p-1. However, if n is non-zero, then the embedding is multiplication by n, but since n is invertible mod p or not? 

Wait, if we have an extension determined by n, where py = nx. If n is coprime to p, then there exists an integer m such that mn ≡ 1 mod p. Then, m py = mn x, which implies p(my) = x. Therefore, replacing y by my, we get the relation p(my) = x. Therefore, the embedding is multiplication by 1. So in this case, if n is coprime to p, the extension is equivalent to the one with n=1. If n is not coprime to p, say n and p share a common divisor d &gt;1, but since p is prime, this implies that n is a multiple of p, so n ≡ 0 mod p. Then, the extension is split. 

But wait, n is an integer, and the extensions are parameterized by n mod p. So if n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in the quotient, so G is ℤ × ℤ_p. But G must be abelian, so the only split extension is ℤ × ℤ_p. But earlier, I thought that if n ≡ 0 mod p, then the extension is split. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, so how can it be an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ? Wait, the exact sequence is 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If G is ℤ × ℤ_p, then the kernel is ℤ, embedded as (1,0), and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G has torsion, which is allowed? Wait, but the quotient is ℤ_p, which is torsion. So G can have torsion. Wait, but if the kernel is ℤ, which is torsion-free, the quotient is torsion, so G can have torsion. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which has torsion. However, in the non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So how does this work?

Wait, if G is ℤ, then the kernel is pℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G is torsion-free. So depending on whether the extension is split or not, G can be either torsion-free or have torsion. So the split extension is G = ℤ × ℤ_p, and the non-split extensions are G = ℤ. But then, if n ≠ 0 mod p, the extension is non-split, and G is ℤ. But there is only one non-split extension? But Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which would suggest there are p different extensions. 

This is confusing. Let me think again. 

We have Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So there are p equivalence classes of extensions. But how do these correspond to different groups G? For each n ∈ ℤ_p, we have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If n=0, then G is the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p. For n ≠0, G is a non-split extension. But if G is non-split, is it always isomorphic to ℤ? 

Wait, no. Let&#x27;s consider n=1. The group G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x is in the center (since G is abelian), and y has the relation that py = x. Then, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, with y as the generator. Then x = py, so the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, which is pℤ inside G. Then, the quotient G / pℤ is ℤ_p. So G is ℤ, and the extension is 0 → pℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0. 

But for n=2, if p ≠2, then the extension would be generated by x and y with py = 2x. Then, similar to the above, if we let z = y - x, then pz = py - px = 2x - px = (2 - p)x. Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, since 2 is invertible mod p (if p≠2), then there exists an integer m such that 2m ≡1 mod p. Then, replacing y with my, we get p(my) = m py = m*2x = (2m)x ≡ x mod p. Therefore, this extension is equivalent to the n=1 case. 

Therefore, for n coprime to p, the extensions are equivalent to the n=1 case. If n is not coprime to p, i.e., n=0 mod p, then it&#x27;s the split extension. Wait, but p is prime, so every n ≠0 mod p is coprime to p. Therefore, all non-zero n mod p give equivalent extensions? But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p. 

Hmm, so there must be a mistake in my reasoning here. Let&#x27;s go back to the computation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). Using the projective resolution:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → ℤ_p → 0

Applying Hom(-, ℤ), we get:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) --p*--&gt; Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → 0

Since Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) =0, this reduces to:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) →0

So the cokernel of multiplication by p is ℤ_p, hence Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, there are p distinct extensions. But if all non-zero extensions are isomorphic, then Ext¹ would be trivial or have fewer elements. So my previous reasoning that all non-zero n give equivalent extensions must be wrong. 

Wait, perhaps when considering equivalence of extensions, the automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p have to be taken into account. So two extensions are equivalent if there is a commutative diagram with automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. The automorphism group of ℤ is ℤ× = {±1}, and the automorphism group of ℤ_p is (ℤ_p)×, which has order p-1. Therefore, when considering equivalence classes of extensions, we might have to mod out by the action of these automorphism groups. However, in the calculation of Ext¹, we are considering extensions up to equivalence where the automorphisms of the kernel and quotient are not factored out. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s can be related by automorphisms of ℤ_p, in the Ext¹ calculation, these are considered distinct. Wait, no. Actually, in the definition of Ext¹, two extensions are equivalent if there exists a morphism between them that is the identity on N and Q. So automorphisms of N and Q are not considered. Therefore, even if two extensions differ by an automorphism of N or Q, they are still considered distinct in Ext¹. Therefore, in our case, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is indeed ℤ_p, with each element corresponding to a different extension. 

Therefore, even though for different n coprime to p, the groups G might be isomorphic, the extensions themselves are different because the way ℤ is embedded and the way the quotient maps are defined are different. So even if two extensions have isomorphic middle groups, if the embeddings and projections are different, they are considered non-equivalent extensions. 

So for example, take p=3. Then we have three extensions: n=0,1,2. For n=0, G=ℤ × ℤ_3. For n=1, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. For n=2, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 6ℤ? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, then the relation is 3y = 2x. If x is the generator of ℤ, then solving for x, we get x = (3/2)y. But since x must be an integer multiple of y, this is only possible if y is even. Wait, this seems problematic. 

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of group presentations. For each n, the group G is generated by x and y with the relation that py = nx. So for n=1, G is generated by x and y with 3y = x. Then, x is redundant as a generator because x = 3y, so G is generated by y, which is infinite cyclic. Therefore, G ≅ ℤ, with the subgroup generated by x = 3y. 

For n=2, G is generated by x and y with 3y = 2x. Then, we can write x = (3/2)y. But x must be an integer multiple of y, so this would require that y is divisible by 2. Let me set y = 2z. Then, x = 3z. Therefore, G is generated by z, with no relations, so G ≅ ℤ. The subgroup generated by x is 3z, so ℤ is embedded as 3ℤ in G. Wait, but this is the same as the n=1 case. So in this case, even though n=2, the group G is still ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. Therefore, the extensions corresponding to n=1 and n=2 are isomorphic? 

But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So where is the error here? 

Ah, perhaps in the equivalence of extensions, the automorphism of ℤ_p comes into play. If we have two extensions where the only difference is an automorphism of ℤ_p, then they would be considered equivalent. For example, if n=2 in the case p=3, then the quotient map G → ℤ_3 sends y to 1 + 3ℤ. But if we compose this with the automorphism of ℤ_3 that multiplies by 2, then the quotient map becomes y ↦ 2 + 3ℤ. Then, the relation becomes 3y = 2x, but after the automorphism, it&#x27;s equivalent to 3y = x. Therefore, the extensions n=1 and n=2 are equivalent under the automorphism of ℤ_p. 

But in the definition of Ext¹, when we compute Ext¹(Q, N), we consider extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are the identity. Therefore, if we allow automorphisms of Q, then different extensions could become equivalent. However, in the standard definition, Ext¹(Q, N) classifies extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are identities. Therefore, in our case, the different n&#x27;s correspond to different extensions even if they are related by automorphisms of Q. 

But in the example above, with p=3, n=1 and n=2 would give extensions that are isomorphic as groups, but the specific quotient maps differ by an automorphism of ℤ_p. Therefore, if we consider extensions up to isomorphism of the groups G, then there are only two isomorphism classes: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p and the non-split extension ℤ. But according to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, there are p equivalence classes of extensions. Therefore, the distinction is in the specific way the quotient is taken and the subgroup is embedded, not just the isomorphism class of G. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s may lead to isomorphic middle groups G, the extensions themselves are different because the maps are different. Hence, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has p elements, corresponding to the p different extensions. The structure of this set is therefore a cyclic group of order p, i.e., ℤ_p. 

But wait, is the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) actually a group? In the context of abelian extensions, yes, the Baer sum gives an abelian group structure on E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and it is isomorphic to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has the structure of the group ℤ_p. 

Alternatively, if we consider non-abelian extensions, but since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, all extensions are abelian. Wait, is that true? Let me check. If G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, then G is necessarily abelian? 

Suppose G is a group with a normal subgroup N ≅ ℤ and G/N ≅ ℤ_p. Is G necessarily abelian? 

Take an element y ∈ G such that the image of y in G/N generates G/N. Then, since G/N has order p, we have y^p ∈ N. Also, since N is abelian, the commutator [y, x] for x ∈ N must lie in N. But N is central in G? Not necessarily. Wait, if N is central, then G is abelian. But if N is not central, then G could be non-abelian. 

But ℤ is a cyclic group, so its automorphism group is ℤ× ≅ {±1}. Therefore, the action of y on N by conjugation must be an automorphism of N. Let’s suppose that conjugation by y acts as multiplication by k on N ≅ ℤ. Then, since y^p ∈ N, we have y^p x y^{-p} = x. But y^p is in N, which is abelian, so conjugation by y^p is trivial. Therefore, the automorphism induced by y must satisfy that its order divides p. But the automorphism group of ℤ is {1, -1}, so the only possibilities are that conjugation by y acts trivially (k=1) or as inversion (k=-1). If p is odd, then inversion has order 2, which does not divide p, unless p=2. Therefore, for odd p, the action must be trivial, so G is abelian. For p=2, inversion has order 2, which divides p=2, so non-abelian extensions are possible. 

Therefore, for p odd, all extensions are abelian, and E(ℤ_p, ℤ) = Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there could be non-abelian extensions. But since the problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t specify whether they are abelian or not, we might need to consider both cases. However, in the case of abelian extensions, as I computed before, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For non-abelian extensions when p=2, let&#x27;s see. 

For p=2, we can have a non-abelian extension where the generator of ℤ_2 acts by inversion on ℤ. Then, G would be the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, where ℤ_2 acts by inversion. This is a non-abelian group. So in this case, E(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have both abelian and non-abelian extensions. However, the question is about equivalence classes of extensions. In the category of groups, extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ), where ℤ is a ℤ_p-module. For p=2, ℤ can be a non-trivial module, so H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have more elements. 

But let&#x27;s compute H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). For group cohomology, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / N(A), where N is the norm map. Wait, when the action is non-trivial, the cohomology groups can be different. Let me recall that for cyclic groups, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / (1 - γ)A, where γ is a generator of ℤ_p. But if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A / pA. But in our case, for p=2, the action could be non-trivial. Let me consider p=2 and ℤ as a ℤ_2-module with the generator acting as -1. Then, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would be computed as follows. 

The group ℤ_2 acts on ℤ by inversion. The cohomology H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) can be computed using the Tate cohomology, which for cyclic groups is H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / (1 + γ)ℤ. Here, γ is the generator of ℤ_2 acting as -1 on ℤ. The norm map is 1 + γ, which acts as 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / 0 = ℤ^{ℤ_2}. But ℤ^{ℤ_2} is the set of elements fixed by the ℤ_2 action. Since the action is inversion, the fixed points are {x ∈ ℤ | -x = x} = {0}. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. Wait, but that would mean there are no non-abelian extensions? But we know that the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian extension. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recall that for group cohomology, H²(G, A) classifies extensions of G by A that are compatible with the module structure. If A is a trivial G-module, then H²(G, A) classifies central extensions. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(G, A) classifies extensions where the conjugation action of G on A matches the module structure. 

In the case of the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, the action is non-trivial (inversion), so this corresponds to a non-trivial ℤ_2-module structure on ℤ. Therefore, the extension is classified by an element of H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. However, according to the calculation above, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group. 

Wait, but maybe I need to use the fact that ℤ is a torsion-free module. Let me check another approach. For a cyclic group G = ℤ_p, the cohomology groups can be computed using the resolution:

... → ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] --N--&gt; ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] → ℤ → 0

where γ is a generator of G, and N is the norm element 1 + γ + ... + γ^{p-1}.

Then, applying Hom(-, A), we get the cochain complex:

0 → Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --N*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; ...

For H²(G, A), we need the second cohomology, which is the kernel of (1-γ)* modulo the image of N*. 

But Hom(ℤ[G], A) ≅ A, since ℤ[G] is free abelian of rank 1. Therefore, the complex becomes:

0 → A --1-γ--&gt; A --N--&gt; A --1-γ--&gt; ...

So H²(G, A) is the kernel of 1 - γ : A → A modulo the image of N : A → A. 

For our case, G=ℤ_2 acting on ℤ by inversion. Then, 1 - γ acts as 1 - (-1) = 2 on ℤ. The norm map N is 1 + γ = 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of multiplication by 2 on ℤ modulo the image of 0, which is 2ℤ / 0 ≅ 2ℤ. But H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) should be a torsion group, but 2ℤ is torsion-free. This suggests something is wrong. 

Wait, perhaps in group cohomology with coefficients in a non-trivial module, H² can be torsion even if the coefficients are torsion-free. But here, the calculation seems to give 2ℤ, which is incorrect. There must be an error in the setup. 

Alternatively, maybe I should use the Tate cohomology. For finite cyclic groups, the Tate cohomology groups are periodic with period 2. But Tate cohomology is defined for finite groups and modules, and in this case, H^2 would be isomorphic to H^0, which for Tate cohomology is A^G / N(A). For our case, A=ℤ with γ acting as -1. Then A^G = {0}, and N(A) = 0, so H^0 = 0. Hence, H² would also be 0. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. 

But this contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group extension. Therefore, perhaps the infinite dihedral group is not a valid extension in this context? Wait, no, the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian group which is an extension of ℤ_2 by ℤ. However, the action is non-trivial, but if we consider the extension as one where the base group is ℤ and the quotient is ℤ_2, then the group is ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2. However, in this case, the ℤ_2 is acting on ℤ, so the module structure is non-trivial. Therefore, such an extension is classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to the cohomology calculation, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which would imply that there are no such extensions. But this is a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the confusion arises because ℤ is not a projective ℤ[G]-module when G acts non-trivially. In the case of the infinite dihedral group, the extension is split, so it corresponds to a semi-direct product, which is classified by a 1-cocycle in H¹(G, Aut(N)), not H². Wait, group extensions with non-abelian kernel are classified by H¹(G, Aut(N)), but in our case, N=ℤ is abelian, so Aut(N)=ℤ×. However, for non-abelian extensions, the action is given by a homomorphism from G to Aut(N), and the extensions are classified by H²(G, Z(N)), where Z(N) is the center. But since N=ℤ is abelian, Z(N)=N, so H²(G, N) classifies extensions with the given action. 

But in our case, if the action is non-trivial, then the extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to our previous calculation, this is 0. However, the infinite dihedral group exists. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation. 

Wait, actually, the infinite dihedral group is a split extension, so it corresponds to the zero element in H²(G, N). But if H²(G, N) is trivial, then all extensions are split. However, the infinite dihedral group is split, so that&#x27;s consistent. Therefore, if H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0 with the non-trivial action, then all extensions with that action are split. But in our case, the only extensions are the split ones. But the infinite dihedral group is indeed a split extension. 

But then, for the trivial action, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Wait, let me recast the problem. If we consider the trivial action, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Because in that case, 1 - γ is the zero map, and N is multiplication by 2. So H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of 0 modulo image of 2, which is ℤ / 2ℤ. Therefore, if the action is trivial, there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. But if the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, so only the split extension exists. 

But the infinite dihedral group is a split extension with the non-trivial action, so it corresponds to the trivial element in H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with non-trivial action. Therefore, if we consider the action as part of the data, then when the action is non-trivial, all extensions are split. When the action is trivial, there are two extensions. 

But in our original problem, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ), the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify the action, but in the case of group extensions, the action is part of the data. However, if we fix the action to be trivial, then for p=2, we have H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, leading to two extensions. But for odd p, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, leading to p extensions. But earlier, we saw that when considering abelian extensions, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. However, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) (for trivial action) is also ℤ_p. 

Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify. For abelian extensions, where the action is trivial, the extensions are classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For group extensions (possibly non-abelian), with trivial action, they are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. But when the action is non-trivial, for p=2, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) =0. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether we are considering the action as part of the data or not. The problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which usually means that ℤ is the kernel and ℤ_p is the quotient. The action is then determined by the conjugation in the group. For abelian extensions, the action must be trivial. For non-abelian extensions, the action can be non-trivial if possible. 

But since ℤ is abelian, the conjugation action of G on ℤ must be trivial on ℤ, so the action factors through G/ℤ ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the action is a homomorphism ℤ_p → Aut(ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2. For p odd, there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from ℤ_p to ℤ_2 since p is odd and ℤ_p has no elements of order 2. Therefore, for p odd, the action must be trivial, so all extensions are abelian and classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there is a non-trivial homomorphism from ℤ_2 to Aut(ℤ), given by inversion. Therefore, extensions can have either trivial or non-trivial action. 

For p=2, if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, so there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ)=0, so only the split extension exists (the infinite dihedral group). Therefore, the total number of extensions is three? Wait, no. When considering group extensions with a given module structure, the action is fixed. Therefore, if we fix the action to be trivial, then there are two extensions. If we fix the action to be non-trivial, there&#x27;s one extension. But in the problem statement, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) without specifying the action, which could mean considering all possible actions. 

But in the literature, when the action is not specified, it&#x27;s usually assumed to be trivial. Alternatively, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might consider all possible extensions with any possible action. In that case, for p=2, we have extensions with trivial action (two) and extensions with non-trivial action (one). But I need to confirm this. 

However, given that the problem mentions &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which is somewhat ambiguous, but in the context of abelian groups, it&#x27;s more likely referring to abelian extensions. Moreover, if the problem is from a course on homological algebra or algebraic topology, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might denote the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions, which would be Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Therefore, taking into account that for each prime p, whether p=2 or odd, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, the structure of E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a cyclic group of order p. Hence, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ is in bijection with ℤ_p, and as a group under the Baer sum, it is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

Therefore, the final answer is that the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is in bijection with ℤ_p, and its structure is that of the cyclic group of order p.

**Final Answer**
The set of equivalence classes of extensions is the cyclic group of order \( p \), so \( E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \) is isomorphic to \( \boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p} \).
&lt;/think&gt;

To compute the equivalence classes of extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\), denoted as \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\), we consider both the group cohomology and homological algebra perspectives. 

1. **Abelian Extensions**: 
   - For abelian extensions, we use the Ext functor. Specifically, we need to compute \(\text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\).
   - Using the projective resolution of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\):
     \[
     0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{p} \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0
     \]
   - Applying \(\text{Hom}(-, \mathbb{Z})\) and considering the long exact sequence, we find:
     \[
     \text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_p
     \]
   - This result indicates that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\) are classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\).

2. **Group Cohomology**:
   - For non-abelian extensions, we consider group cohomology \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\). However, since \(\mathbb{Z}\) is a trivial \(\mathbb{Z}_p\)-module and \(\mathbb{Z}\) is torsion-free, the cohomology group \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) also leads to the same result for trivial actions.
   - For \(p = 2\), non-trivial actions (inversion) are possible, but they do not contribute additional equivalence classes as shown by cohomology calculations.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) of equivalence classes of extensions, whether considered as abelian extensions or group extensions with trivial action, is classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\). This structure holds for both odd and even primes \(p\).

Thus, the structure of the set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) is the cyclic group of order \(p\), leading to the final answer:

\[
\boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to compute the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ, denoted as E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and figure out the structure of this set. Hmm, extensions of groups, right? I remember that in group theory, an extension of a group Q by a group N is a group G such that N is a normal subgroup of G and G/N is isomorphic to Q. So in this case, we&#x27;re looking at extensions where the quotient group is ℤ_p and the normal subgroup is ℤ. 

First, let me recall the general theory of group extensions. Extensions are classified by the second cohomology group H²(Q, N), where the action of Q on N is given by some module structure. But here, both N and Q are abelian groups, so the extensions should also be abelian. Wait, is that right? If both groups are abelian, then the extension is also abelian if the action is trivial? Maybe I need to be careful here.

Let me double-check. For abelian extensions, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N is isomorphic to Ext¹(Q, N). But in general, group extensions (not necessarily abelian) are classified by H²(Q, N). But since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, maybe we&#x27;re dealing with abelian extensions here. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify whether the extensions are required to be abelian, but since both groups are abelian, it&#x27;s possible that we are considering central extensions, which would be classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But I need to verify this.

Wait, Ext¹ is for abelian extensions, right? Let me recall: For abelian groups, the Ext functor in homological algebra classifies extensions. Specifically, Ext¹(Q, N) corresponds to the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N. So if we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions, then we need to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). However, if we consider arbitrary group extensions, then it would be H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But since ℤ is a trivial ℤ_p-module in the case of group cohomology? Wait, but ℤ_p acts on ℤ? How?

Wait, in group cohomology, the coefficients have to be a module over the group. So ℤ here would need to be a ℤ_p-module. If the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) would classify central extensions. But ℤ_p is cyclic of order p, and ℤ is torsion-free. So maybe the only action possible is trivial. Because any automorphism of ℤ is multiplication by ±1, but since ℤ_p is a cyclic group of order p, the action has to satisfy that applying the automorphism p times is the identity. But if we have multiplication by -1, then applying it p times would be multiplication by (-1)^p. If p is odd, this is -1, which is not the identity. If p=2, then it&#x27;s 1. So for p=2, a nontrivial action is possible, but for odd p, only the trivial action is possible. Wait, so maybe for p=2, ℤ could have a nontrivial ℤ_2 module structure where the generator acts as multiplication by -1. But ℤ is written additively, so the action would be x ↦ -x. Then, applying it twice would give the identity, which works for ℤ_2.

But in the problem statement, are we considering arbitrary extensions, or central extensions? The notation E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a bit ambiguous. In the literature, sometimes E(G, A) denotes equivalence classes of extensions of G by A, which could be nonabelian. But given that both ℤ_p and ℤ are abelian, if we consider abelian extensions, then the extensions would also be abelian groups. Alternatively, if we allow nonabelian extensions, even with abelian kernel and quotient, the set might be larger. But in general, I think that when dealing with abelian groups, people often consider abelian extensions, so perhaps the question is about abelian extensions. Let me check.

If we are to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ), then since Ext¹ is the derived functor, we can compute it using a projective resolution of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s recall that ℤ_p is isomorphic to ℤ / pℤ. So we can take the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, where the first map is multiplication by p. Applying the functor Hom(-, ℤ), we get the long exact sequence:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ, ℤ) → ...

But Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) is 0 because ℤ is torsion-free and ℤ_p is torsion. Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is isomorphic to ℤ, generated by the identity map. The map Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is induced by multiplication by p, so it&#x27;s also multiplication by p in Hom(ℤ, ℤ) ≅ ℤ. Therefore, the kernel is 0 and the cokernel is ℤ / pℤ. Then, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Wait, so this would mean that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ are in bijection with ℤ_p. Each element of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) corresponds to an abelian extension. So the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. But what do these extensions look like?

An abelian extension would be an abelian group G with a subgroup isomorphic to ℤ such that the quotient is isomorphic to ℤ_p. Since G is abelian and ℤ is a free abelian group, any such extension must split, right? Wait, no. If the extension splits, then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, but ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, whereas ℤ is torsion-free. Wait, but ℤ_p has torsion. Wait, but G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, so there is an exact sequence 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If the extension splits, then G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free because it has elements of order p. But the image of ℤ in G is a normal subgroup (since G is abelian) and the quotient is ℤ_p. However, if the extension doesn&#x27;t split, then G would have to be torsion-free? Wait, but how?

Wait, if G is an abelian group containing ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G is generated by the elements of ℤ and a preimage of the generator of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s suppose that ℤ is generated by x, and the generator of ℤ_p is y + ℤ. Then in G, we have that p(y + ℤ) = 0, so py ∈ ℤ. Therefore, py = nx for some integer n. Therefore, G is generated by x and y with relation py = nx. So depending on n, we can get different extensions. However, since n is an integer, but we can adjust y by multiples of x, so different n&#x27;s can give equivalent extensions. Specifically, if we replace y by y + kx, then p(y + kx) = py + pkx = nx + pkx = (n + pk)x. Therefore, n is determined modulo pℤ. Hence, the equivalence classes are parameterized by ℤ_p. So each extension is determined by an integer n modulo p, which tells us how many times we &quot;twist&quot; the generator y around the subgroup ℤ. Therefore, the equivalence classes are in bijection with ℤ_p. 

But in the case when n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in G, but G is generated by x and y with py = 0. Wait, but x has infinite order, and y has order p. Then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, which is the split extension. For other values of n, we get non-split extensions. For example, take n=1. Then G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x = py, so G is generated by y, with the relation that p^2 y = 0? Wait, no, wait. If py = x, then x is in the subgroup generated by y. Therefore, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, since x and y are related by py = x. Then, the quotient G / ℤ would be generated by y + ℤ, and since py = x ∈ ℤ, we have p(y + ℤ) = 0 in G / ℤ. So G / ℤ is cyclic of order p. But G itself is generated by y, and since x = py, then G is isomorphic to ℤ via y ↦ 1. But then G / ℤ would be ℤ / pℤ, which is correct. Wait, but then G is just ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ? Wait, that can&#x27;t be. If G is ℤ, then the subgroup would have to be pℤ, and the quotient would be ℤ_p. But that&#x27;s exactly the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0 where the first map is multiplication by p. So in this case, the extension is equivalent to the trivial extension? Wait, no. Wait, if n=1, then the extension is 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, but this is not split. Because in this case, G is ℤ, which can&#x27;t be written as a direct product of ℤ and ℤ_p. 

Wait, but if we have G being ℤ with the subgroup pℤ, then G is indeed just ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. So this is a non-split extension. But if we take n=0, then the extension would be split: 0 → ℤ → ℤ × ℤ_p → ℤ_p → 0. So the equivalence classes of extensions are in correspondence with n mod p, which is ℤ_p. So Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) of equivalence classes of abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

But hold on, earlier I thought that G can be generated by y with relation p^2 y = 0 if n=1, but that&#x27;s not correct. Because if we set py = x, which is in ℤ, then x is a generator of ℤ. So G is actually generated by y, and x is just py. Therefore, G is still ℤ, with y being a generator. Then the subgroup ℤ inside G is generated by x = py. Therefore, G is isomorphic to ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ. So indeed, this is the extension where ℤ is included as pℤ inside ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ / pℤ = ℤ_p. So all these extensions are actually isomorphic to ℤ, but with different embeddings of the subgroup. Wait, but in the category of abelian groups, how do we consider equivalence of extensions? 

Two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s a commutative diagram:

0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0

  ↓      ↓       ↓

0 → ℤ → G&#x27; → ℤ_p → 0

With the middle arrow being an isomorphism. So even if G and G&#x27; are both isomorphic to ℤ, but the embeddings of ℤ are different, then the extensions might not be equivalent. For example, if we have two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is coprime to p, then these would be inequivalent extensions. Wait, but in our case, the embeddings are determined by n mod p. For each n mod p, the embedding is multiplication by n. But if n is invertible mod p, does that give a different embedding? Wait, but in the case of n=1, the embedding is pℤ, and if n is coprime to p, say n=2, then the embedding is 2pℤ? Wait, no. Wait, in the extension corresponding to n, the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, and we have py = nx. So if n is coprime to p, then x is a multiple of py. For example, if n=1, x = py. If n=2, x = py, so 2x = p(2y). But 2 is invertible mod p if p is odd, so 2y would generate the same subgroup as y. Wait, maybe this is getting confused. 

Alternatively, maybe all these extensions are isomorphic as groups, but the specific embeddings are different. However, in the category of abelian groups, the automorphisms of ℤ are limited to multiplication by ±1. So if two embeddings differ by a automorphism of ℤ, then the extensions are equivalent. So if the embedding is given by multiplication by n, then if we can find an automorphism of ℤ (i.e., multiplication by ±1) such that n is sent to another integer, but since n is mod p, we can adjust n by ±1. But actually, the equivalence classes are determined by the module structure, so maybe the parameter n is considered up to automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. 

Wait, but according to the calculation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) being ℤ_p, the equivalence classes are in one-to-one correspondence with ℤ_p. So even though all the middle groups G might be isomorphic to ℤ or ℤ × ℤ_p, the actual extensions are considered different if the embeddings or the projections are different. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which is not isomorphic to ℤ. But when we have non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So actually, how come some extensions have G ≅ ℤ and others G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p? 

Wait, no, actually, in the case of the non-split extensions, G is always ℤ. Because if you have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0, then G has to be torsion-free if it&#x27;s abelian, because ℤ is torsion-free. But ℤ × ℤ_p has torsion, so it can&#x27;t be torsion-free. Therefore, only the non-split extensions result in G being ℤ, and the split extension would have G as ℤ × ℤ_p, which is impossible because that&#x27;s not torsion-free. Wait, this is a contradiction. 

Hold on, maybe all abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ must have G torsion-free. Therefore, the only possible extension is the non-split one. But according to our earlier calculation, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which suggests there are multiple extensions. But how can there be multiple non-isomorphic extensions? 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let&#x27;s consider the extensions. If G is abelian, torsion-free, and contains ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G must be isomorphic to ℤ. Because the only torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are ℤ and subgroups of ℚ. But if G is finitely generated (which it is, since it&#x27;s an extension of finite cyclic group by ℤ), then it must be isomorphic to ℤ. So actually, all such extensions have G ≅ ℤ, but with different embeddings. But in the category of abelian groups, two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s an isomorphism between the middle groups compatible with the embeddings and projections. 

So for example, take two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is an integer. Then these would define different extensions if k is not ±1. But since in abelian groups, automorphisms of ℤ are only ±1, the different multiples would lead to inequivalent extensions. But in our case, the extensions are parameterized by n mod p, so n can be 0,1,...,p-1. However, if n is non-zero, then the embedding is multiplication by n, but since n is invertible mod p or not? 

Wait, if we have an extension determined by n, where py = nx. If n is coprime to p, then there exists an integer m such that mn ≡ 1 mod p. Then, m py = mn x, which implies p(my) = x. Therefore, replacing y by my, we get the relation p(my) = x. Therefore, the embedding is multiplication by 1. So in this case, if n is coprime to p, the extension is equivalent to the one with n=1. If n is not coprime to p, say n and p share a common divisor d &gt;1, but since p is prime, this implies that n is a multiple of p, so n ≡ 0 mod p. Then, the extension is split. 

But wait, n is an integer, and the extensions are parameterized by n mod p. So if n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in the quotient, so G is ℤ × ℤ_p. But G must be abelian, so the only split extension is ℤ × ℤ_p. But earlier, I thought that if n ≡ 0 mod p, then the extension is split. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, so how can it be an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ? Wait, the exact sequence is 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If G is ℤ × ℤ_p, then the kernel is ℤ, embedded as (1,0), and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G has torsion, which is allowed? Wait, but the quotient is ℤ_p, which is torsion. So G can have torsion. Wait, but if the kernel is ℤ, which is torsion-free, the quotient is torsion, so G can have torsion. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which has torsion. However, in the non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So how does this work?

Wait, if G is ℤ, then the kernel is pℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G is torsion-free. So depending on whether the extension is split or not, G can be either torsion-free or have torsion. So the split extension is G = ℤ × ℤ_p, and the non-split extensions are G = ℤ. But then, if n ≠ 0 mod p, the extension is non-split, and G is ℤ. But there is only one non-split extension? But Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which would suggest there are p different extensions. 

This is confusing. Let me think again. 

We have Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So there are p equivalence classes of extensions. But how do these correspond to different groups G? For each n ∈ ℤ_p, we have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If n=0, then G is the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p. For n ≠0, G is a non-split extension. But if G is non-split, is it always isomorphic to ℤ? 

Wait, no. Let&#x27;s consider n=1. The group G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x is in the center (since G is abelian), and y has the relation that py = x. Then, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, with y as the generator. Then x = py, so the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, which is pℤ inside G. Then, the quotient G / pℤ is ℤ_p. So G is ℤ, and the extension is 0 → pℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0. 

But for n=2, if p ≠2, then the extension would be generated by x and y with py = 2x. Then, similar to the above, if we let z = y - x, then pz = py - px = 2x - px = (2 - p)x. Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, since 2 is invertible mod p (if p≠2), then there exists an integer m such that 2m ≡1 mod p. Then, replacing y with my, we get p(my) = m py = m*2x = (2m)x ≡ x mod p. Therefore, this extension is equivalent to the n=1 case. 

Therefore, for n coprime to p, the extensions are equivalent to the n=1 case. If n is not coprime to p, i.e., n=0 mod p, then it&#x27;s the split extension. Wait, but p is prime, so every n ≠0 mod p is coprime to p. Therefore, all non-zero n mod p give equivalent extensions? But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p. 

Hmm, so there must be a mistake in my reasoning here. Let&#x27;s go back to the computation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). Using the projective resolution:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → ℤ_p → 0

Applying Hom(-, ℤ), we get:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) --p*--&gt; Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → 0

Since Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) =0, this reduces to:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) →0

So the cokernel of multiplication by p is ℤ_p, hence Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, there are p distinct extensions. But if all non-zero extensions are isomorphic, then Ext¹ would be trivial or have fewer elements. So my previous reasoning that all non-zero n give equivalent extensions must be wrong. 

Wait, perhaps when considering equivalence of extensions, the automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p have to be taken into account. So two extensions are equivalent if there is a commutative diagram with automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. The automorphism group of ℤ is ℤ× = {±1}, and the automorphism group of ℤ_p is (ℤ_p)×, which has order p-1. Therefore, when considering equivalence classes of extensions, we might have to mod out by the action of these automorphism groups. However, in the calculation of Ext¹, we are considering extensions up to equivalence where the automorphisms of the kernel and quotient are not factored out. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s can be related by automorphisms of ℤ_p, in the Ext¹ calculation, these are considered distinct. Wait, no. Actually, in the definition of Ext¹, two extensions are equivalent if there exists a morphism between them that is the identity on N and Q. So automorphisms of N and Q are not considered. Therefore, even if two extensions differ by an automorphism of N or Q, they are still considered distinct in Ext¹. Therefore, in our case, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is indeed ℤ_p, with each element corresponding to a different extension. 

Therefore, even though for different n coprime to p, the groups G might be isomorphic, the extensions themselves are different because the way ℤ is embedded and the way the quotient maps are defined are different. So even if two extensions have isomorphic middle groups, if the embeddings and projections are different, they are considered non-equivalent extensions. 

So for example, take p=3. Then we have three extensions: n=0,1,2. For n=0, G=ℤ × ℤ_3. For n=1, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. For n=2, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 6ℤ? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, then the relation is 3y = 2x. If x is the generator of ℤ, then solving for x, we get x = (3/2)y. But since x must be an integer multiple of y, this is only possible if y is even. Wait, this seems problematic. 

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of group presentations. For each n, the group G is generated by x and y with the relation that py = nx. So for n=1, G is generated by x and y with 3y = x. Then, x is redundant as a generator because x = 3y, so G is generated by y, which is infinite cyclic. Therefore, G ≅ ℤ, with the subgroup generated by x = 3y. 

For n=2, G is generated by x and y with 3y = 2x. Then, we can write x = (3/2)y. But x must be an integer multiple of y, so this would require that y is divisible by 2. Let me set y = 2z. Then, x = 3z. Therefore, G is generated by z, with no relations, so G ≅ ℤ. The subgroup generated by x is 3z, so ℤ is embedded as 3ℤ in G. Wait, but this is the same as the n=1 case. So in this case, even though n=2, the group G is still ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. Therefore, the extensions corresponding to n=1 and n=2 are isomorphic? 

But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So where is the error here? 

Ah, perhaps in the equivalence of extensions, the automorphism of ℤ_p comes into play. If we have two extensions where the only difference is an automorphism of ℤ_p, then they would be considered equivalent. For example, if n=2 in the case p=3, then the quotient map G → ℤ_3 sends y to 1 + 3ℤ. But if we compose this with the automorphism of ℤ_3 that multiplies by 2, then the quotient map becomes y ↦ 2 + 3ℤ. Then, the relation becomes 3y = 2x, but after the automorphism, it&#x27;s equivalent to 3y = x. Therefore, the extensions n=1 and n=2 are equivalent under the automorphism of ℤ_p. 

But in the definition of Ext¹, when we compute Ext¹(Q, N), we consider extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are the identity. Therefore, if we allow automorphisms of Q, then different extensions could become equivalent. However, in the standard definition, Ext¹(Q, N) classifies extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are identities. Therefore, in our case, the different n&#x27;s correspond to different extensions even if they are related by automorphisms of Q. 

But in the example above, with p=3, n=1 and n=2 would give extensions that are isomorphic as groups, but the specific quotient maps differ by an automorphism of ℤ_p. Therefore, if we consider extensions up to isomorphism of the groups G, then there are only two isomorphism classes: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p and the non-split extension ℤ. But according to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, there are p equivalence classes of extensions. Therefore, the distinction is in the specific way the quotient is taken and the subgroup is embedded, not just the isomorphism class of G. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s may lead to isomorphic middle groups G, the extensions themselves are different because the maps are different. Hence, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has p elements, corresponding to the p different extensions. The structure of this set is therefore a cyclic group of order p, i.e., ℤ_p. 

But wait, is the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) actually a group? In the context of abelian extensions, yes, the Baer sum gives an abelian group structure on E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and it is isomorphic to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has the structure of the group ℤ_p. 

Alternatively, if we consider non-abelian extensions, but since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, all extensions are abelian. Wait, is that true? Let me check. If G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, then G is necessarily abelian? 

Suppose G is a group with a normal subgroup N ≅ ℤ and G/N ≅ ℤ_p. Is G necessarily abelian? 

Take an element y ∈ G such that the image of y in G/N generates G/N. Then, since G/N has order p, we have y^p ∈ N. Also, since N is abelian, the commutator [y, x] for x ∈ N must lie in N. But N is central in G? Not necessarily. Wait, if N is central, then G is abelian. But if N is not central, then G could be non-abelian. 

But ℤ is a cyclic group, so its automorphism group is ℤ× ≅ {±1}. Therefore, the action of y on N by conjugation must be an automorphism of N. Let’s suppose that conjugation by y acts as multiplication by k on N ≅ ℤ. Then, since y^p ∈ N, we have y^p x y^{-p} = x. But y^p is in N, which is abelian, so conjugation by y^p is trivial. Therefore, the automorphism induced by y must satisfy that its order divides p. But the automorphism group of ℤ is {1, -1}, so the only possibilities are that conjugation by y acts trivially (k=1) or as inversion (k=-1). If p is odd, then inversion has order 2, which does not divide p, unless p=2. Therefore, for odd p, the action must be trivial, so G is abelian. For p=2, inversion has order 2, which divides p=2, so non-abelian extensions are possible. 

Therefore, for p odd, all extensions are abelian, and E(ℤ_p, ℤ) = Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there could be non-abelian extensions. But since the problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t specify whether they are abelian or not, we might need to consider both cases. However, in the case of abelian extensions, as I computed before, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For non-abelian extensions when p=2, let&#x27;s see. 

For p=2, we can have a non-abelian extension where the generator of ℤ_2 acts by inversion on ℤ. Then, G would be the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, where ℤ_2 acts by inversion. This is a non-abelian group. So in this case, E(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have both abelian and non-abelian extensions. However, the question is about equivalence classes of extensions. In the category of groups, extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ), where ℤ is a ℤ_p-module. For p=2, ℤ can be a non-trivial module, so H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have more elements. 

But let&#x27;s compute H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). For group cohomology, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / N(A), where N is the norm map. Wait, when the action is non-trivial, the cohomology groups can be different. Let me recall that for cyclic groups, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / (1 - γ)A, where γ is a generator of ℤ_p. But if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A / pA. But in our case, for p=2, the action could be non-trivial. Let me consider p=2 and ℤ as a ℤ_2-module with the generator acting as -1. Then, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would be computed as follows. 

The group ℤ_2 acts on ℤ by inversion. The cohomology H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) can be computed using the Tate cohomology, which for cyclic groups is H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / (1 + γ)ℤ. Here, γ is the generator of ℤ_2 acting as -1 on ℤ. The norm map is 1 + γ, which acts as 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / 0 = ℤ^{ℤ_2}. But ℤ^{ℤ_2} is the set of elements fixed by the ℤ_2 action. Since the action is inversion, the fixed points are {x ∈ ℤ | -x = x} = {0}. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. Wait, but that would mean there are no non-abelian extensions? But we know that the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian extension. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recall that for group cohomology, H²(G, A) classifies extensions of G by A that are compatible with the module structure. If A is a trivial G-module, then H²(G, A) classifies central extensions. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(G, A) classifies extensions where the conjugation action of G on A matches the module structure. 

In the case of the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, the action is non-trivial (inversion), so this corresponds to a non-trivial ℤ_2-module structure on ℤ. Therefore, the extension is classified by an element of H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. However, according to the calculation above, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group. 

Wait, but maybe I need to use the fact that ℤ is a torsion-free module. Let me check another approach. For a cyclic group G = ℤ_p, the cohomology groups can be computed using the resolution:

... → ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] --N--&gt; ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] → ℤ → 0

where γ is a generator of G, and N is the norm element 1 + γ + ... + γ^{p-1}.

Then, applying Hom(-, A), we get the cochain complex:

0 → Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --N*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; ...

For H²(G, A), we need the second cohomology, which is the kernel of (1-γ)* modulo the image of N*. 

But Hom(ℤ[G], A) ≅ A, since ℤ[G] is free abelian of rank 1. Therefore, the complex becomes:

0 → A --1-γ--&gt; A --N--&gt; A --1-γ--&gt; ...

So H²(G, A) is the kernel of 1 - γ : A → A modulo the image of N : A → A. 

For our case, G=ℤ_2 acting on ℤ by inversion. Then, 1 - γ acts as 1 - (-1) = 2 on ℤ. The norm map N is 1 + γ = 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of multiplication by 2 on ℤ modulo the image of 0, which is 2ℤ / 0 ≅ 2ℤ. But H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) should be a torsion group, but 2ℤ is torsion-free. This suggests something is wrong. 

Wait, perhaps in group cohomology with coefficients in a non-trivial module, H² can be torsion even if the coefficients are torsion-free. But here, the calculation seems to give 2ℤ, which is incorrect. There must be an error in the setup. 

Alternatively, maybe I should use the Tate cohomology. For finite cyclic groups, the Tate cohomology groups are periodic with period 2. But Tate cohomology is defined for finite groups and modules, and in this case, H^2 would be isomorphic to H^0, which for Tate cohomology is A^G / N(A). For our case, A=ℤ with γ acting as -1. Then A^G = {0}, and N(A) = 0, so H^0 = 0. Hence, H² would also be 0. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. 

But this contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group extension. Therefore, perhaps the infinite dihedral group is not a valid extension in this context? Wait, no, the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian group which is an extension of ℤ_2 by ℤ. However, the action is non-trivial, but if we consider the extension as one where the base group is ℤ and the quotient is ℤ_2, then the group is ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2. However, in this case, the ℤ_2 is acting on ℤ, so the module structure is non-trivial. Therefore, such an extension is classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to the cohomology calculation, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which would imply that there are no such extensions. But this is a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the confusion arises because ℤ is not a projective ℤ[G]-module when G acts non-trivially. In the case of the infinite dihedral group, the extension is split, so it corresponds to a semi-direct product, which is classified by a 1-cocycle in H¹(G, Aut(N)), not H². Wait, group extensions with non-abelian kernel are classified by H¹(G, Aut(N)), but in our case, N=ℤ is abelian, so Aut(N)=ℤ×. However, for non-abelian extensions, the action is given by a homomorphism from G to Aut(N), and the extensions are classified by H²(G, Z(N)), where Z(N) is the center. But since N=ℤ is abelian, Z(N)=N, so H²(G, N) classifies extensions with the given action. 

But in our case, if the action is non-trivial, then the extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to our previous calculation, this is 0. However, the infinite dihedral group exists. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation. 

Wait, actually, the infinite dihedral group is a split extension, so it corresponds to the zero element in H²(G, N). But if H²(G, N) is trivial, then all extensions are split. However, the infinite dihedral group is split, so that&#x27;s consistent. Therefore, if H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0 with the non-trivial action, then all extensions with that action are split. But in our case, the only extensions are the split ones. But the infinite dihedral group is indeed a split extension. 

But then, for the trivial action, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Wait, let me recast the problem. If we consider the trivial action, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Because in that case, 1 - γ is the zero map, and N is multiplication by 2. So H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of 0 modulo image of 2, which is ℤ / 2ℤ. Therefore, if the action is trivial, there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. But if the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, so only the split extension exists. 

But the infinite dihedral group is a split extension with the non-trivial action, so it corresponds to the trivial element in H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with non-trivial action. Therefore, if we consider the action as part of the data, then when the action is non-trivial, all extensions are split. When the action is trivial, there are two extensions. 

But in our original problem, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ), the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify the action, but in the case of group extensions, the action is part of the data. However, if we fix the action to be trivial, then for p=2, we have H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, leading to two extensions. But for odd p, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, leading to p extensions. But earlier, we saw that when considering abelian extensions, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. However, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) (for trivial action) is also ℤ_p. 

Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify. For abelian extensions, where the action is trivial, the extensions are classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For group extensions (possibly non-abelian), with trivial action, they are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. But when the action is non-trivial, for p=2, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) =0. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether we are considering the action as part of the data or not. The problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which usually means that ℤ is the kernel and ℤ_p is the quotient. The action is then determined by the conjugation in the group. For abelian extensions, the action must be trivial. For non-abelian extensions, the action can be non-trivial if possible. 

But since ℤ is abelian, the conjugation action of G on ℤ must be trivial on ℤ, so the action factors through G/ℤ ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the action is a homomorphism ℤ_p → Aut(ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2. For p odd, there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from ℤ_p to ℤ_2 since p is odd and ℤ_p has no elements of order 2. Therefore, for p odd, the action must be trivial, so all extensions are abelian and classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there is a non-trivial homomorphism from ℤ_2 to Aut(ℤ), given by inversion. Therefore, extensions can have either trivial or non-trivial action. 

For p=2, if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, so there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ)=0, so only the split extension exists (the infinite dihedral group). Therefore, the total number of extensions is three? Wait, no. When considering group extensions with a given module structure, the action is fixed. Therefore, if we fix the action to be trivial, then there are two extensions. If we fix the action to be non-trivial, there&#x27;s one extension. But in the problem statement, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) without specifying the action, which could mean considering all possible actions. 

But in the literature, when the action is not specified, it&#x27;s usually assumed to be trivial. Alternatively, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might consider all possible extensions with any possible action. In that case, for p=2, we have extensions with trivial action (two) and extensions with non-trivial action (one). But I need to confirm this. 

However, given that the problem mentions &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which is somewhat ambiguous, but in the context of abelian groups, it&#x27;s more likely referring to abelian extensions. Moreover, if the problem is from a course on homological algebra or algebraic topology, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might denote the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions, which would be Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Therefore, taking into account that for each prime p, whether p=2 or odd, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, the structure of E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a cyclic group of order p. Hence, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ is in bijection with ℤ_p, and as a group under the Baer sum, it is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

Therefore, the final answer is that the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is in bijection with ℤ_p, and its structure is that of the cyclic group of order p.

**Final Answer**
The set of equivalence classes of extensions is the cyclic group of order \( p \), so \( E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \) is isomorphic to \( \boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p} \).
&lt;/think&gt;

To compute the equivalence classes of extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\), denoted as \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\), we consider both the group cohomology and homological algebra perspectives. 

1. **Abelian Extensions**: 
   - For abelian extensions, we use the Ext functor. Specifically, we need to compute \(\text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\).
   - Using the projective resolution of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\):
     \[
     0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{p} \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0
     \]
   - Applying \(\text{Hom}(-, \mathbb{Z})\) and considering the long exact sequence, we find:
     \[
     \text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_p
     \]
   - This result indicates that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\) are classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\).

2. **Group Cohomology**:
   - For non-abelian extensions, we consider group cohomology \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\). However, since \(\mathbb{Z}\) is a trivial \(\mathbb{Z}_p\)-module and \(\mathbb{Z}\) is torsion-free, the cohomology group \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) also leads to the same result for trivial actions.
   - For \(p = 2\), non-trivial actions (inversion) are possible, but they do not contribute additional equivalence classes as shown by cohomology calculations.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) of equivalence classes of extensions, whether considered as abelian extensions or group extensions with trivial action, is classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\). This structure holds for both odd and even primes \(p\).

Thus, the structure of the set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) is the cyclic group of order \(p\), leading to the final answer:

\[
\boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to compute the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ, denoted as E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and figure out the structure of this set. Hmm, extensions of groups, right? I remember that in group theory, an extension of a group Q by a group N is a group G such that N is a normal subgroup of G and G/N is isomorphic to Q. So in this case, we&#x27;re looking at extensions where the quotient group is ℤ_p and the normal subgroup is ℤ. 

First, let me recall the general theory of group extensions. Extensions are classified by the second cohomology group H²(Q, N), where the action of Q on N is given by some module structure. But here, both N and Q are abelian groups, so the extensions should also be abelian. Wait, is that right? If both groups are abelian, then the extension is also abelian if the action is trivial? Maybe I need to be careful here.

Let me double-check. For abelian extensions, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N is isomorphic to Ext¹(Q, N). But in general, group extensions (not necessarily abelian) are classified by H²(Q, N). But since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, maybe we&#x27;re dealing with abelian extensions here. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify whether the extensions are required to be abelian, but since both groups are abelian, it&#x27;s possible that we are considering central extensions, which would be classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But I need to verify this.

Wait, Ext¹ is for abelian extensions, right? Let me recall: For abelian groups, the Ext functor in homological algebra classifies extensions. Specifically, Ext¹(Q, N) corresponds to the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N. So if we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions, then we need to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). However, if we consider arbitrary group extensions, then it would be H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But since ℤ is a trivial ℤ_p-module in the case of group cohomology? Wait, but ℤ_p acts on ℤ? How?

Wait, in group cohomology, the coefficients have to be a module over the group. So ℤ here would need to be a ℤ_p-module. If the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) would classify central extensions. But ℤ_p is cyclic of order p, and ℤ is torsion-free. So maybe the only action possible is trivial. Because any automorphism of ℤ is multiplication by ±1, but since ℤ_p is a cyclic group of order p, the action has to satisfy that applying the automorphism p times is the identity. But if we have multiplication by -1, then applying it p times would be multiplication by (-1)^p. If p is odd, this is -1, which is not the identity. If p=2, then it&#x27;s 1. So for p=2, a nontrivial action is possible, but for odd p, only the trivial action is possible. Wait, so maybe for p=2, ℤ could have a nontrivial ℤ_2 module structure where the generator acts as multiplication by -1. But ℤ is written additively, so the action would be x ↦ -x. Then, applying it twice would give the identity, which works for ℤ_2.

But in the problem statement, are we considering arbitrary extensions, or central extensions? The notation E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a bit ambiguous. In the literature, sometimes E(G, A) denotes equivalence classes of extensions of G by A, which could be nonabelian. But given that both ℤ_p and ℤ are abelian, if we consider abelian extensions, then the extensions would also be abelian groups. Alternatively, if we allow nonabelian extensions, even with abelian kernel and quotient, the set might be larger. But in general, I think that when dealing with abelian groups, people often consider abelian extensions, so perhaps the question is about abelian extensions. Let me check.

If we are to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ), then since Ext¹ is the derived functor, we can compute it using a projective resolution of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s recall that ℤ_p is isomorphic to ℤ / pℤ. So we can take the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, where the first map is multiplication by p. Applying the functor Hom(-, ℤ), we get the long exact sequence:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ, ℤ) → ...

But Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) is 0 because ℤ is torsion-free and ℤ_p is torsion. Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is isomorphic to ℤ, generated by the identity map. The map Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is induced by multiplication by p, so it&#x27;s also multiplication by p in Hom(ℤ, ℤ) ≅ ℤ. Therefore, the kernel is 0 and the cokernel is ℤ / pℤ. Then, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Wait, so this would mean that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ are in bijection with ℤ_p. Each element of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) corresponds to an abelian extension. So the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. But what do these extensions look like?

An abelian extension would be an abelian group G with a subgroup isomorphic to ℤ such that the quotient is isomorphic to ℤ_p. Since G is abelian and ℤ is a free abelian group, any such extension must split, right? Wait, no. If the extension splits, then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, but ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, whereas ℤ is torsion-free. Wait, but ℤ_p has torsion. Wait, but G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, so there is an exact sequence 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If the extension splits, then G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free because it has elements of order p. But the image of ℤ in G is a normal subgroup (since G is abelian) and the quotient is ℤ_p. However, if the extension doesn&#x27;t split, then G would have to be torsion-free? Wait, but how?

Wait, if G is an abelian group containing ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G is generated by the elements of ℤ and a preimage of the generator of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s suppose that ℤ is generated by x, and the generator of ℤ_p is y + ℤ. Then in G, we have that p(y + ℤ) = 0, so py ∈ ℤ. Therefore, py = nx for some integer n. Therefore, G is generated by x and y with relation py = nx. So depending on n, we can get different extensions. However, since n is an integer, but we can adjust y by multiples of x, so different n&#x27;s can give equivalent extensions. Specifically, if we replace y by y + kx, then p(y + kx) = py + pkx = nx + pkx = (n + pk)x. Therefore, n is determined modulo pℤ. Hence, the equivalence classes are parameterized by ℤ_p. So each extension is determined by an integer n modulo p, which tells us how many times we &quot;twist&quot; the generator y around the subgroup ℤ. Therefore, the equivalence classes are in bijection with ℤ_p. 

But in the case when n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in G, but G is generated by x and y with py = 0. Wait, but x has infinite order, and y has order p. Then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, which is the split extension. For other values of n, we get non-split extensions. For example, take n=1. Then G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x = py, so G is generated by y, with the relation that p^2 y = 0? Wait, no, wait. If py = x, then x is in the subgroup generated by y. Therefore, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, since x and y are related by py = x. Then, the quotient G / ℤ would be generated by y + ℤ, and since py = x ∈ ℤ, we have p(y + ℤ) = 0 in G / ℤ. So G / ℤ is cyclic of order p. But G itself is generated by y, and since x = py, then G is isomorphic to ℤ via y ↦ 1. But then G / ℤ would be ℤ / pℤ, which is correct. Wait, but then G is just ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ? Wait, that can&#x27;t be. If G is ℤ, then the subgroup would have to be pℤ, and the quotient would be ℤ_p. But that&#x27;s exactly the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0 where the first map is multiplication by p. So in this case, the extension is equivalent to the trivial extension? Wait, no. Wait, if n=1, then the extension is 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, but this is not split. Because in this case, G is ℤ, which can&#x27;t be written as a direct product of ℤ and ℤ_p. 

Wait, but if we have G being ℤ with the subgroup pℤ, then G is indeed just ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. So this is a non-split extension. But if we take n=0, then the extension would be split: 0 → ℤ → ℤ × ℤ_p → ℤ_p → 0. So the equivalence classes of extensions are in correspondence with n mod p, which is ℤ_p. So Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) of equivalence classes of abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

But hold on, earlier I thought that G can be generated by y with relation p^2 y = 0 if n=1, but that&#x27;s not correct. Because if we set py = x, which is in ℤ, then x is a generator of ℤ. So G is actually generated by y, and x is just py. Therefore, G is still ℤ, with y being a generator. Then the subgroup ℤ inside G is generated by x = py. Therefore, G is isomorphic to ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ. So indeed, this is the extension where ℤ is included as pℤ inside ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ / pℤ = ℤ_p. So all these extensions are actually isomorphic to ℤ, but with different embeddings of the subgroup. Wait, but in the category of abelian groups, how do we consider equivalence of extensions? 

Two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s a commutative diagram:

0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0

  ↓      ↓       ↓

0 → ℤ → G&#x27; → ℤ_p → 0

With the middle arrow being an isomorphism. So even if G and G&#x27; are both isomorphic to ℤ, but the embeddings of ℤ are different, then the extensions might not be equivalent. For example, if we have two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is coprime to p, then these would be inequivalent extensions. Wait, but in our case, the embeddings are determined by n mod p. For each n mod p, the embedding is multiplication by n. But if n is invertible mod p, does that give a different embedding? Wait, but in the case of n=1, the embedding is pℤ, and if n is coprime to p, say n=2, then the embedding is 2pℤ? Wait, no. Wait, in the extension corresponding to n, the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, and we have py = nx. So if n is coprime to p, then x is a multiple of py. For example, if n=1, x = py. If n=2, x = py, so 2x = p(2y). But 2 is invertible mod p if p is odd, so 2y would generate the same subgroup as y. Wait, maybe this is getting confused. 

Alternatively, maybe all these extensions are isomorphic as groups, but the specific embeddings are different. However, in the category of abelian groups, the automorphisms of ℤ are limited to multiplication by ±1. So if two embeddings differ by a automorphism of ℤ, then the extensions are equivalent. So if the embedding is given by multiplication by n, then if we can find an automorphism of ℤ (i.e., multiplication by ±1) such that n is sent to another integer, but since n is mod p, we can adjust n by ±1. But actually, the equivalence classes are determined by the module structure, so maybe the parameter n is considered up to automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. 

Wait, but according to the calculation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) being ℤ_p, the equivalence classes are in one-to-one correspondence with ℤ_p. So even though all the middle groups G might be isomorphic to ℤ or ℤ × ℤ_p, the actual extensions are considered different if the embeddings or the projections are different. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which is not isomorphic to ℤ. But when we have non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So actually, how come some extensions have G ≅ ℤ and others G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p? 

Wait, no, actually, in the case of the non-split extensions, G is always ℤ. Because if you have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0, then G has to be torsion-free if it&#x27;s abelian, because ℤ is torsion-free. But ℤ × ℤ_p has torsion, so it can&#x27;t be torsion-free. Therefore, only the non-split extensions result in G being ℤ, and the split extension would have G as ℤ × ℤ_p, which is impossible because that&#x27;s not torsion-free. Wait, this is a contradiction. 

Hold on, maybe all abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ must have G torsion-free. Therefore, the only possible extension is the non-split one. But according to our earlier calculation, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which suggests there are multiple extensions. But how can there be multiple non-isomorphic extensions? 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let&#x27;s consider the extensions. If G is abelian, torsion-free, and contains ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G must be isomorphic to ℤ. Because the only torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are ℤ and subgroups of ℚ. But if G is finitely generated (which it is, since it&#x27;s an extension of finite cyclic group by ℤ), then it must be isomorphic to ℤ. So actually, all such extensions have G ≅ ℤ, but with different embeddings. But in the category of abelian groups, two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s an isomorphism between the middle groups compatible with the embeddings and projections. 

So for example, take two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is an integer. Then these would define different extensions if k is not ±1. But since in abelian groups, automorphisms of ℤ are only ±1, the different multiples would lead to inequivalent extensions. But in our case, the extensions are parameterized by n mod p, so n can be 0,1,...,p-1. However, if n is non-zero, then the embedding is multiplication by n, but since n is invertible mod p or not? 

Wait, if we have an extension determined by n, where py = nx. If n is coprime to p, then there exists an integer m such that mn ≡ 1 mod p. Then, m py = mn x, which implies p(my) = x. Therefore, replacing y by my, we get the relation p(my) = x. Therefore, the embedding is multiplication by 1. So in this case, if n is coprime to p, the extension is equivalent to the one with n=1. If n is not coprime to p, say n and p share a common divisor d &gt;1, but since p is prime, this implies that n is a multiple of p, so n ≡ 0 mod p. Then, the extension is split. 

But wait, n is an integer, and the extensions are parameterized by n mod p. So if n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in the quotient, so G is ℤ × ℤ_p. But G must be abelian, so the only split extension is ℤ × ℤ_p. But earlier, I thought that if n ≡ 0 mod p, then the extension is split. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, so how can it be an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ? Wait, the exact sequence is 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If G is ℤ × ℤ_p, then the kernel is ℤ, embedded as (1,0), and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G has torsion, which is allowed? Wait, but the quotient is ℤ_p, which is torsion. So G can have torsion. Wait, but if the kernel is ℤ, which is torsion-free, the quotient is torsion, so G can have torsion. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which has torsion. However, in the non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So how does this work?

Wait, if G is ℤ, then the kernel is pℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G is torsion-free. So depending on whether the extension is split or not, G can be either torsion-free or have torsion. So the split extension is G = ℤ × ℤ_p, and the non-split extensions are G = ℤ. But then, if n ≠ 0 mod p, the extension is non-split, and G is ℤ. But there is only one non-split extension? But Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which would suggest there are p different extensions. 

This is confusing. Let me think again. 

We have Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So there are p equivalence classes of extensions. But how do these correspond to different groups G? For each n ∈ ℤ_p, we have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If n=0, then G is the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p. For n ≠0, G is a non-split extension. But if G is non-split, is it always isomorphic to ℤ? 

Wait, no. Let&#x27;s consider n=1. The group G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x is in the center (since G is abelian), and y has the relation that py = x. Then, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, with y as the generator. Then x = py, so the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, which is pℤ inside G. Then, the quotient G / pℤ is ℤ_p. So G is ℤ, and the extension is 0 → pℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0. 

But for n=2, if p ≠2, then the extension would be generated by x and y with py = 2x. Then, similar to the above, if we let z = y - x, then pz = py - px = 2x - px = (2 - p)x. Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, since 2 is invertible mod p (if p≠2), then there exists an integer m such that 2m ≡1 mod p. Then, replacing y with my, we get p(my) = m py = m*2x = (2m)x ≡ x mod p. Therefore, this extension is equivalent to the n=1 case. 

Therefore, for n coprime to p, the extensions are equivalent to the n=1 case. If n is not coprime to p, i.e., n=0 mod p, then it&#x27;s the split extension. Wait, but p is prime, so every n ≠0 mod p is coprime to p. Therefore, all non-zero n mod p give equivalent extensions? But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p. 

Hmm, so there must be a mistake in my reasoning here. Let&#x27;s go back to the computation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). Using the projective resolution:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → ℤ_p → 0

Applying Hom(-, ℤ), we get:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) --p*--&gt; Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → 0

Since Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) =0, this reduces to:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) →0

So the cokernel of multiplication by p is ℤ_p, hence Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, there are p distinct extensions. But if all non-zero extensions are isomorphic, then Ext¹ would be trivial or have fewer elements. So my previous reasoning that all non-zero n give equivalent extensions must be wrong. 

Wait, perhaps when considering equivalence of extensions, the automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p have to be taken into account. So two extensions are equivalent if there is a commutative diagram with automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. The automorphism group of ℤ is ℤ× = {±1}, and the automorphism group of ℤ_p is (ℤ_p)×, which has order p-1. Therefore, when considering equivalence classes of extensions, we might have to mod out by the action of these automorphism groups. However, in the calculation of Ext¹, we are considering extensions up to equivalence where the automorphisms of the kernel and quotient are not factored out. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s can be related by automorphisms of ℤ_p, in the Ext¹ calculation, these are considered distinct. Wait, no. Actually, in the definition of Ext¹, two extensions are equivalent if there exists a morphism between them that is the identity on N and Q. So automorphisms of N and Q are not considered. Therefore, even if two extensions differ by an automorphism of N or Q, they are still considered distinct in Ext¹. Therefore, in our case, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is indeed ℤ_p, with each element corresponding to a different extension. 

Therefore, even though for different n coprime to p, the groups G might be isomorphic, the extensions themselves are different because the way ℤ is embedded and the way the quotient maps are defined are different. So even if two extensions have isomorphic middle groups, if the embeddings and projections are different, they are considered non-equivalent extensions. 

So for example, take p=3. Then we have three extensions: n=0,1,2. For n=0, G=ℤ × ℤ_3. For n=1, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. For n=2, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 6ℤ? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, then the relation is 3y = 2x. If x is the generator of ℤ, then solving for x, we get x = (3/2)y. But since x must be an integer multiple of y, this is only possible if y is even. Wait, this seems problematic. 

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of group presentations. For each n, the group G is generated by x and y with the relation that py = nx. So for n=1, G is generated by x and y with 3y = x. Then, x is redundant as a generator because x = 3y, so G is generated by y, which is infinite cyclic. Therefore, G ≅ ℤ, with the subgroup generated by x = 3y. 

For n=2, G is generated by x and y with 3y = 2x. Then, we can write x = (3/2)y. But x must be an integer multiple of y, so this would require that y is divisible by 2. Let me set y = 2z. Then, x = 3z. Therefore, G is generated by z, with no relations, so G ≅ ℤ. The subgroup generated by x is 3z, so ℤ is embedded as 3ℤ in G. Wait, but this is the same as the n=1 case. So in this case, even though n=2, the group G is still ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. Therefore, the extensions corresponding to n=1 and n=2 are isomorphic? 

But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So where is the error here? 

Ah, perhaps in the equivalence of extensions, the automorphism of ℤ_p comes into play. If we have two extensions where the only difference is an automorphism of ℤ_p, then they would be considered equivalent. For example, if n=2 in the case p=3, then the quotient map G → ℤ_3 sends y to 1 + 3ℤ. But if we compose this with the automorphism of ℤ_3 that multiplies by 2, then the quotient map becomes y ↦ 2 + 3ℤ. Then, the relation becomes 3y = 2x, but after the automorphism, it&#x27;s equivalent to 3y = x. Therefore, the extensions n=1 and n=2 are equivalent under the automorphism of ℤ_p. 

But in the definition of Ext¹, when we compute Ext¹(Q, N), we consider extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are the identity. Therefore, if we allow automorphisms of Q, then different extensions could become equivalent. However, in the standard definition, Ext¹(Q, N) classifies extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are identities. Therefore, in our case, the different n&#x27;s correspond to different extensions even if they are related by automorphisms of Q. 

But in the example above, with p=3, n=1 and n=2 would give extensions that are isomorphic as groups, but the specific quotient maps differ by an automorphism of ℤ_p. Therefore, if we consider extensions up to isomorphism of the groups G, then there are only two isomorphism classes: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p and the non-split extension ℤ. But according to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, there are p equivalence classes of extensions. Therefore, the distinction is in the specific way the quotient is taken and the subgroup is embedded, not just the isomorphism class of G. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s may lead to isomorphic middle groups G, the extensions themselves are different because the maps are different. Hence, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has p elements, corresponding to the p different extensions. The structure of this set is therefore a cyclic group of order p, i.e., ℤ_p. 

But wait, is the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) actually a group? In the context of abelian extensions, yes, the Baer sum gives an abelian group structure on E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and it is isomorphic to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has the structure of the group ℤ_p. 

Alternatively, if we consider non-abelian extensions, but since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, all extensions are abelian. Wait, is that true? Let me check. If G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, then G is necessarily abelian? 

Suppose G is a group with a normal subgroup N ≅ ℤ and G/N ≅ ℤ_p. Is G necessarily abelian? 

Take an element y ∈ G such that the image of y in G/N generates G/N. Then, since G/N has order p, we have y^p ∈ N. Also, since N is abelian, the commutator [y, x] for x ∈ N must lie in N. But N is central in G? Not necessarily. Wait, if N is central, then G is abelian. But if N is not central, then G could be non-abelian. 

But ℤ is a cyclic group, so its automorphism group is ℤ× ≅ {±1}. Therefore, the action of y on N by conjugation must be an automorphism of N. Let’s suppose that conjugation by y acts as multiplication by k on N ≅ ℤ. Then, since y^p ∈ N, we have y^p x y^{-p} = x. But y^p is in N, which is abelian, so conjugation by y^p is trivial. Therefore, the automorphism induced by y must satisfy that its order divides p. But the automorphism group of ℤ is {1, -1}, so the only possibilities are that conjugation by y acts trivially (k=1) or as inversion (k=-1). If p is odd, then inversion has order 2, which does not divide p, unless p=2. Therefore, for odd p, the action must be trivial, so G is abelian. For p=2, inversion has order 2, which divides p=2, so non-abelian extensions are possible. 

Therefore, for p odd, all extensions are abelian, and E(ℤ_p, ℤ) = Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there could be non-abelian extensions. But since the problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t specify whether they are abelian or not, we might need to consider both cases. However, in the case of abelian extensions, as I computed before, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For non-abelian extensions when p=2, let&#x27;s see. 

For p=2, we can have a non-abelian extension where the generator of ℤ_2 acts by inversion on ℤ. Then, G would be the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, where ℤ_2 acts by inversion. This is a non-abelian group. So in this case, E(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have both abelian and non-abelian extensions. However, the question is about equivalence classes of extensions. In the category of groups, extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ), where ℤ is a ℤ_p-module. For p=2, ℤ can be a non-trivial module, so H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have more elements. 

But let&#x27;s compute H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). For group cohomology, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / N(A), where N is the norm map. Wait, when the action is non-trivial, the cohomology groups can be different. Let me recall that for cyclic groups, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / (1 - γ)A, where γ is a generator of ℤ_p. But if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A / pA. But in our case, for p=2, the action could be non-trivial. Let me consider p=2 and ℤ as a ℤ_2-module with the generator acting as -1. Then, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would be computed as follows. 

The group ℤ_2 acts on ℤ by inversion. The cohomology H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) can be computed using the Tate cohomology, which for cyclic groups is H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / (1 + γ)ℤ. Here, γ is the generator of ℤ_2 acting as -1 on ℤ. The norm map is 1 + γ, which acts as 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / 0 = ℤ^{ℤ_2}. But ℤ^{ℤ_2} is the set of elements fixed by the ℤ_2 action. Since the action is inversion, the fixed points are {x ∈ ℤ | -x = x} = {0}. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. Wait, but that would mean there are no non-abelian extensions? But we know that the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian extension. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recall that for group cohomology, H²(G, A) classifies extensions of G by A that are compatible with the module structure. If A is a trivial G-module, then H²(G, A) classifies central extensions. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(G, A) classifies extensions where the conjugation action of G on A matches the module structure. 

In the case of the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, the action is non-trivial (inversion), so this corresponds to a non-trivial ℤ_2-module structure on ℤ. Therefore, the extension is classified by an element of H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. However, according to the calculation above, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group. 

Wait, but maybe I need to use the fact that ℤ is a torsion-free module. Let me check another approach. For a cyclic group G = ℤ_p, the cohomology groups can be computed using the resolution:

... → ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] --N--&gt; ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] → ℤ → 0

where γ is a generator of G, and N is the norm element 1 + γ + ... + γ^{p-1}.

Then, applying Hom(-, A), we get the cochain complex:

0 → Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --N*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; ...

For H²(G, A), we need the second cohomology, which is the kernel of (1-γ)* modulo the image of N*. 

But Hom(ℤ[G], A) ≅ A, since ℤ[G] is free abelian of rank 1. Therefore, the complex becomes:

0 → A --1-γ--&gt; A --N--&gt; A --1-γ--&gt; ...

So H²(G, A) is the kernel of 1 - γ : A → A modulo the image of N : A → A. 

For our case, G=ℤ_2 acting on ℤ by inversion. Then, 1 - γ acts as 1 - (-1) = 2 on ℤ. The norm map N is 1 + γ = 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of multiplication by 2 on ℤ modulo the image of 0, which is 2ℤ / 0 ≅ 2ℤ. But H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) should be a torsion group, but 2ℤ is torsion-free. This suggests something is wrong. 

Wait, perhaps in group cohomology with coefficients in a non-trivial module, H² can be torsion even if the coefficients are torsion-free. But here, the calculation seems to give 2ℤ, which is incorrect. There must be an error in the setup. 

Alternatively, maybe I should use the Tate cohomology. For finite cyclic groups, the Tate cohomology groups are periodic with period 2. But Tate cohomology is defined for finite groups and modules, and in this case, H^2 would be isomorphic to H^0, which for Tate cohomology is A^G / N(A). For our case, A=ℤ with γ acting as -1. Then A^G = {0}, and N(A) = 0, so H^0 = 0. Hence, H² would also be 0. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. 

But this contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group extension. Therefore, perhaps the infinite dihedral group is not a valid extension in this context? Wait, no, the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian group which is an extension of ℤ_2 by ℤ. However, the action is non-trivial, but if we consider the extension as one where the base group is ℤ and the quotient is ℤ_2, then the group is ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2. However, in this case, the ℤ_2 is acting on ℤ, so the module structure is non-trivial. Therefore, such an extension is classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to the cohomology calculation, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which would imply that there are no such extensions. But this is a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the confusion arises because ℤ is not a projective ℤ[G]-module when G acts non-trivially. In the case of the infinite dihedral group, the extension is split, so it corresponds to a semi-direct product, which is classified by a 1-cocycle in H¹(G, Aut(N)), not H². Wait, group extensions with non-abelian kernel are classified by H¹(G, Aut(N)), but in our case, N=ℤ is abelian, so Aut(N)=ℤ×. However, for non-abelian extensions, the action is given by a homomorphism from G to Aut(N), and the extensions are classified by H²(G, Z(N)), where Z(N) is the center. But since N=ℤ is abelian, Z(N)=N, so H²(G, N) classifies extensions with the given action. 

But in our case, if the action is non-trivial, then the extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to our previous calculation, this is 0. However, the infinite dihedral group exists. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation. 

Wait, actually, the infinite dihedral group is a split extension, so it corresponds to the zero element in H²(G, N). But if H²(G, N) is trivial, then all extensions are split. However, the infinite dihedral group is split, so that&#x27;s consistent. Therefore, if H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0 with the non-trivial action, then all extensions with that action are split. But in our case, the only extensions are the split ones. But the infinite dihedral group is indeed a split extension. 

But then, for the trivial action, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Wait, let me recast the problem. If we consider the trivial action, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Because in that case, 1 - γ is the zero map, and N is multiplication by 2. So H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of 0 modulo image of 2, which is ℤ / 2ℤ. Therefore, if the action is trivial, there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. But if the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, so only the split extension exists. 

But the infinite dihedral group is a split extension with the non-trivial action, so it corresponds to the trivial element in H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with non-trivial action. Therefore, if we consider the action as part of the data, then when the action is non-trivial, all extensions are split. When the action is trivial, there are two extensions. 

But in our original problem, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ), the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify the action, but in the case of group extensions, the action is part of the data. However, if we fix the action to be trivial, then for p=2, we have H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, leading to two extensions. But for odd p, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, leading to p extensions. But earlier, we saw that when considering abelian extensions, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. However, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) (for trivial action) is also ℤ_p. 

Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify. For abelian extensions, where the action is trivial, the extensions are classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For group extensions (possibly non-abelian), with trivial action, they are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. But when the action is non-trivial, for p=2, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) =0. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether we are considering the action as part of the data or not. The problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which usually means that ℤ is the kernel and ℤ_p is the quotient. The action is then determined by the conjugation in the group. For abelian extensions, the action must be trivial. For non-abelian extensions, the action can be non-trivial if possible. 

But since ℤ is abelian, the conjugation action of G on ℤ must be trivial on ℤ, so the action factors through G/ℤ ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the action is a homomorphism ℤ_p → Aut(ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2. For p odd, there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from ℤ_p to ℤ_2 since p is odd and ℤ_p has no elements of order 2. Therefore, for p odd, the action must be trivial, so all extensions are abelian and classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there is a non-trivial homomorphism from ℤ_2 to Aut(ℤ), given by inversion. Therefore, extensions can have either trivial or non-trivial action. 

For p=2, if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, so there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ)=0, so only the split extension exists (the infinite dihedral group). Therefore, the total number of extensions is three? Wait, no. When considering group extensions with a given module structure, the action is fixed. Therefore, if we fix the action to be trivial, then there are two extensions. If we fix the action to be non-trivial, there&#x27;s one extension. But in the problem statement, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) without specifying the action, which could mean considering all possible actions. 

But in the literature, when the action is not specified, it&#x27;s usually assumed to be trivial. Alternatively, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might consider all possible extensions with any possible action. In that case, for p=2, we have extensions with trivial action (two) and extensions with non-trivial action (one). But I need to confirm this. 

However, given that the problem mentions &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which is somewhat ambiguous, but in the context of abelian groups, it&#x27;s more likely referring to abelian extensions. Moreover, if the problem is from a course on homological algebra or algebraic topology, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might denote the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions, which would be Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Therefore, taking into account that for each prime p, whether p=2 or odd, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, the structure of E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a cyclic group of order p. Hence, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ is in bijection with ℤ_p, and as a group under the Baer sum, it is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

Therefore, the final answer is that the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is in bijection with ℤ_p, and its structure is that of the cyclic group of order p.

**Final Answer**
The set of equivalence classes of extensions is the cyclic group of order \( p \), so \( E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \) is isomorphic to \( \boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p} \).
&lt;/think&gt;

To compute the equivalence classes of extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\), denoted as \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\), we consider both the group cohomology and homological algebra perspectives. 

1. **Abelian Extensions**: 
   - For abelian extensions, we use the Ext functor. Specifically, we need to compute \(\text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\).
   - Using the projective resolution of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\):
     \[
     0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{p} \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0
     \]
   - Applying \(\text{Hom}(-, \mathbb{Z})\) and considering the long exact sequence, we find:
     \[
     \text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_p
     \]
   - This result indicates that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\) are classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\).

2. **Group Cohomology**:
   - For non-abelian extensions, we consider group cohomology \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\). However, since \(\mathbb{Z}\) is a trivial \(\mathbb{Z}_p\)-module and \(\mathbb{Z}\) is torsion-free, the cohomology group \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) also leads to the same result for trivial actions.
   - For \(p = 2\), non-trivial actions (inversion) are possible, but they do not contribute additional equivalence classes as shown by cohomology calculations.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) of equivalence classes of extensions, whether considered as abelian extensions or group extensions with trivial action, is classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\). This structure holds for both odd and even primes \(p\).

Thus, the structure of the set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) is the cyclic group of order \(p\), leading to the final answer:

\[
\boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to compute the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ, denoted as E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and figure out the structure of this set. Hmm, extensions of groups, right? I remember that in group theory, an extension of a group Q by a group N is a group G such that N is a normal subgroup of G and G/N is isomorphic to Q. So in this case, we&#x27;re looking at extensions where the quotient group is ℤ_p and the normal subgroup is ℤ. 

First, let me recall the general theory of group extensions. Extensions are classified by the second cohomology group H²(Q, N), where the action of Q on N is given by some module structure. But here, both N and Q are abelian groups, so the extensions should also be abelian. Wait, is that right? If both groups are abelian, then the extension is also abelian if the action is trivial? Maybe I need to be careful here.

Let me double-check. For abelian extensions, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N is isomorphic to Ext¹(Q, N). But in general, group extensions (not necessarily abelian) are classified by H²(Q, N). But since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, maybe we&#x27;re dealing with abelian extensions here. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify whether the extensions are required to be abelian, but since both groups are abelian, it&#x27;s possible that we are considering central extensions, which would be classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But I need to verify this.

Wait, Ext¹ is for abelian extensions, right? Let me recall: For abelian groups, the Ext functor in homological algebra classifies extensions. Specifically, Ext¹(Q, N) corresponds to the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N. So if we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions, then we need to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). However, if we consider arbitrary group extensions, then it would be H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But since ℤ is a trivial ℤ_p-module in the case of group cohomology? Wait, but ℤ_p acts on ℤ? How?

Wait, in group cohomology, the coefficients have to be a module over the group. So ℤ here would need to be a ℤ_p-module. If the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) would classify central extensions. But ℤ_p is cyclic of order p, and ℤ is torsion-free. So maybe the only action possible is trivial. Because any automorphism of ℤ is multiplication by ±1, but since ℤ_p is a cyclic group of order p, the action has to satisfy that applying the automorphism p times is the identity. But if we have multiplication by -1, then applying it p times would be multiplication by (-1)^p. If p is odd, this is -1, which is not the identity. If p=2, then it&#x27;s 1. So for p=2, a nontrivial action is possible, but for odd p, only the trivial action is possible. Wait, so maybe for p=2, ℤ could have a nontrivial ℤ_2 module structure where the generator acts as multiplication by -1. But ℤ is written additively, so the action would be x ↦ -x. Then, applying it twice would give the identity, which works for ℤ_2.

But in the problem statement, are we considering arbitrary extensions, or central extensions? The notation E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a bit ambiguous. In the literature, sometimes E(G, A) denotes equivalence classes of extensions of G by A, which could be nonabelian. But given that both ℤ_p and ℤ are abelian, if we consider abelian extensions, then the extensions would also be abelian groups. Alternatively, if we allow nonabelian extensions, even with abelian kernel and quotient, the set might be larger. But in general, I think that when dealing with abelian groups, people often consider abelian extensions, so perhaps the question is about abelian extensions. Let me check.

If we are to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ), then since Ext¹ is the derived functor, we can compute it using a projective resolution of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s recall that ℤ_p is isomorphic to ℤ / pℤ. So we can take the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, where the first map is multiplication by p. Applying the functor Hom(-, ℤ), we get the long exact sequence:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ, ℤ) → ...

But Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) is 0 because ℤ is torsion-free and ℤ_p is torsion. Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is isomorphic to ℤ, generated by the identity map. The map Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is induced by multiplication by p, so it&#x27;s also multiplication by p in Hom(ℤ, ℤ) ≅ ℤ. Therefore, the kernel is 0 and the cokernel is ℤ / pℤ. Then, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Wait, so this would mean that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ are in bijection with ℤ_p. Each element of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) corresponds to an abelian extension. So the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. But what do these extensions look like?

An abelian extension would be an abelian group G with a subgroup isomorphic to ℤ such that the quotient is isomorphic to ℤ_p. Since G is abelian and ℤ is a free abelian group, any such extension must split, right? Wait, no. If the extension splits, then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, but ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, whereas ℤ is torsion-free. Wait, but ℤ_p has torsion. Wait, but G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, so there is an exact sequence 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If the extension splits, then G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free because it has elements of order p. But the image of ℤ in G is a normal subgroup (since G is abelian) and the quotient is ℤ_p. However, if the extension doesn&#x27;t split, then G would have to be torsion-free? Wait, but how?

Wait, if G is an abelian group containing ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G is generated by the elements of ℤ and a preimage of the generator of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s suppose that ℤ is generated by x, and the generator of ℤ_p is y + ℤ. Then in G, we have that p(y + ℤ) = 0, so py ∈ ℤ. Therefore, py = nx for some integer n. Therefore, G is generated by x and y with relation py = nx. So depending on n, we can get different extensions. However, since n is an integer, but we can adjust y by multiples of x, so different n&#x27;s can give equivalent extensions. Specifically, if we replace y by y + kx, then p(y + kx) = py + pkx = nx + pkx = (n + pk)x. Therefore, n is determined modulo pℤ. Hence, the equivalence classes are parameterized by ℤ_p. So each extension is determined by an integer n modulo p, which tells us how many times we &quot;twist&quot; the generator y around the subgroup ℤ. Therefore, the equivalence classes are in bijection with ℤ_p. 

But in the case when n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in G, but G is generated by x and y with py = 0. Wait, but x has infinite order, and y has order p. Then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, which is the split extension. For other values of n, we get non-split extensions. For example, take n=1. Then G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x = py, so G is generated by y, with the relation that p^2 y = 0? Wait, no, wait. If py = x, then x is in the subgroup generated by y. Therefore, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, since x and y are related by py = x. Then, the quotient G / ℤ would be generated by y + ℤ, and since py = x ∈ ℤ, we have p(y + ℤ) = 0 in G / ℤ. So G / ℤ is cyclic of order p. But G itself is generated by y, and since x = py, then G is isomorphic to ℤ via y ↦ 1. But then G / ℤ would be ℤ / pℤ, which is correct. Wait, but then G is just ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ? Wait, that can&#x27;t be. If G is ℤ, then the subgroup would have to be pℤ, and the quotient would be ℤ_p. But that&#x27;s exactly the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0 where the first map is multiplication by p. So in this case, the extension is equivalent to the trivial extension? Wait, no. Wait, if n=1, then the extension is 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, but this is not split. Because in this case, G is ℤ, which can&#x27;t be written as a direct product of ℤ and ℤ_p. 

Wait, but if we have G being ℤ with the subgroup pℤ, then G is indeed just ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. So this is a non-split extension. But if we take n=0, then the extension would be split: 0 → ℤ → ℤ × ℤ_p → ℤ_p → 0. So the equivalence classes of extensions are in correspondence with n mod p, which is ℤ_p. So Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) of equivalence classes of abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

But hold on, earlier I thought that G can be generated by y with relation p^2 y = 0 if n=1, but that&#x27;s not correct. Because if we set py = x, which is in ℤ, then x is a generator of ℤ. So G is actually generated by y, and x is just py. Therefore, G is still ℤ, with y being a generator. Then the subgroup ℤ inside G is generated by x = py. Therefore, G is isomorphic to ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ. So indeed, this is the extension where ℤ is included as pℤ inside ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ / pℤ = ℤ_p. So all these extensions are actually isomorphic to ℤ, but with different embeddings of the subgroup. Wait, but in the category of abelian groups, how do we consider equivalence of extensions? 

Two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s a commutative diagram:

0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0

  ↓      ↓       ↓

0 → ℤ → G&#x27; → ℤ_p → 0

With the middle arrow being an isomorphism. So even if G and G&#x27; are both isomorphic to ℤ, but the embeddings of ℤ are different, then the extensions might not be equivalent. For example, if we have two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is coprime to p, then these would be inequivalent extensions. Wait, but in our case, the embeddings are determined by n mod p. For each n mod p, the embedding is multiplication by n. But if n is invertible mod p, does that give a different embedding? Wait, but in the case of n=1, the embedding is pℤ, and if n is coprime to p, say n=2, then the embedding is 2pℤ? Wait, no. Wait, in the extension corresponding to n, the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, and we have py = nx. So if n is coprime to p, then x is a multiple of py. For example, if n=1, x = py. If n=2, x = py, so 2x = p(2y). But 2 is invertible mod p if p is odd, so 2y would generate the same subgroup as y. Wait, maybe this is getting confused. 

Alternatively, maybe all these extensions are isomorphic as groups, but the specific embeddings are different. However, in the category of abelian groups, the automorphisms of ℤ are limited to multiplication by ±1. So if two embeddings differ by a automorphism of ℤ, then the extensions are equivalent. So if the embedding is given by multiplication by n, then if we can find an automorphism of ℤ (i.e., multiplication by ±1) such that n is sent to another integer, but since n is mod p, we can adjust n by ±1. But actually, the equivalence classes are determined by the module structure, so maybe the parameter n is considered up to automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. 

Wait, but according to the calculation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) being ℤ_p, the equivalence classes are in one-to-one correspondence with ℤ_p. So even though all the middle groups G might be isomorphic to ℤ or ℤ × ℤ_p, the actual extensions are considered different if the embeddings or the projections are different. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which is not isomorphic to ℤ. But when we have non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So actually, how come some extensions have G ≅ ℤ and others G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p? 

Wait, no, actually, in the case of the non-split extensions, G is always ℤ. Because if you have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0, then G has to be torsion-free if it&#x27;s abelian, because ℤ is torsion-free. But ℤ × ℤ_p has torsion, so it can&#x27;t be torsion-free. Therefore, only the non-split extensions result in G being ℤ, and the split extension would have G as ℤ × ℤ_p, which is impossible because that&#x27;s not torsion-free. Wait, this is a contradiction. 

Hold on, maybe all abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ must have G torsion-free. Therefore, the only possible extension is the non-split one. But according to our earlier calculation, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which suggests there are multiple extensions. But how can there be multiple non-isomorphic extensions? 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let&#x27;s consider the extensions. If G is abelian, torsion-free, and contains ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G must be isomorphic to ℤ. Because the only torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are ℤ and subgroups of ℚ. But if G is finitely generated (which it is, since it&#x27;s an extension of finite cyclic group by ℤ), then it must be isomorphic to ℤ. So actually, all such extensions have G ≅ ℤ, but with different embeddings. But in the category of abelian groups, two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s an isomorphism between the middle groups compatible with the embeddings and projections. 

So for example, take two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is an integer. Then these would define different extensions if k is not ±1. But since in abelian groups, automorphisms of ℤ are only ±1, the different multiples would lead to inequivalent extensions. But in our case, the extensions are parameterized by n mod p, so n can be 0,1,...,p-1. However, if n is non-zero, then the embedding is multiplication by n, but since n is invertible mod p or not? 

Wait, if we have an extension determined by n, where py = nx. If n is coprime to p, then there exists an integer m such that mn ≡ 1 mod p. Then, m py = mn x, which implies p(my) = x. Therefore, replacing y by my, we get the relation p(my) = x. Therefore, the embedding is multiplication by 1. So in this case, if n is coprime to p, the extension is equivalent to the one with n=1. If n is not coprime to p, say n and p share a common divisor d &gt;1, but since p is prime, this implies that n is a multiple of p, so n ≡ 0 mod p. Then, the extension is split. 

But wait, n is an integer, and the extensions are parameterized by n mod p. So if n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in the quotient, so G is ℤ × ℤ_p. But G must be abelian, so the only split extension is ℤ × ℤ_p. But earlier, I thought that if n ≡ 0 mod p, then the extension is split. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, so how can it be an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ? Wait, the exact sequence is 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If G is ℤ × ℤ_p, then the kernel is ℤ, embedded as (1,0), and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G has torsion, which is allowed? Wait, but the quotient is ℤ_p, which is torsion. So G can have torsion. Wait, but if the kernel is ℤ, which is torsion-free, the quotient is torsion, so G can have torsion. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which has torsion. However, in the non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So how does this work?

Wait, if G is ℤ, then the kernel is pℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G is torsion-free. So depending on whether the extension is split or not, G can be either torsion-free or have torsion. So the split extension is G = ℤ × ℤ_p, and the non-split extensions are G = ℤ. But then, if n ≠ 0 mod p, the extension is non-split, and G is ℤ. But there is only one non-split extension? But Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which would suggest there are p different extensions. 

This is confusing. Let me think again. 

We have Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So there are p equivalence classes of extensions. But how do these correspond to different groups G? For each n ∈ ℤ_p, we have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If n=0, then G is the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p. For n ≠0, G is a non-split extension. But if G is non-split, is it always isomorphic to ℤ? 

Wait, no. Let&#x27;s consider n=1. The group G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x is in the center (since G is abelian), and y has the relation that py = x. Then, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, with y as the generator. Then x = py, so the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, which is pℤ inside G. Then, the quotient G / pℤ is ℤ_p. So G is ℤ, and the extension is 0 → pℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0. 

But for n=2, if p ≠2, then the extension would be generated by x and y with py = 2x. Then, similar to the above, if we let z = y - x, then pz = py - px = 2x - px = (2 - p)x. Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, since 2 is invertible mod p (if p≠2), then there exists an integer m such that 2m ≡1 mod p. Then, replacing y with my, we get p(my) = m py = m*2x = (2m)x ≡ x mod p. Therefore, this extension is equivalent to the n=1 case. 

Therefore, for n coprime to p, the extensions are equivalent to the n=1 case. If n is not coprime to p, i.e., n=0 mod p, then it&#x27;s the split extension. Wait, but p is prime, so every n ≠0 mod p is coprime to p. Therefore, all non-zero n mod p give equivalent extensions? But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p. 

Hmm, so there must be a mistake in my reasoning here. Let&#x27;s go back to the computation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). Using the projective resolution:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → ℤ_p → 0

Applying Hom(-, ℤ), we get:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) --p*--&gt; Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → 0

Since Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) =0, this reduces to:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) →0

So the cokernel of multiplication by p is ℤ_p, hence Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, there are p distinct extensions. But if all non-zero extensions are isomorphic, then Ext¹ would be trivial or have fewer elements. So my previous reasoning that all non-zero n give equivalent extensions must be wrong. 

Wait, perhaps when considering equivalence of extensions, the automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p have to be taken into account. So two extensions are equivalent if there is a commutative diagram with automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. The automorphism group of ℤ is ℤ× = {±1}, and the automorphism group of ℤ_p is (ℤ_p)×, which has order p-1. Therefore, when considering equivalence classes of extensions, we might have to mod out by the action of these automorphism groups. However, in the calculation of Ext¹, we are considering extensions up to equivalence where the automorphisms of the kernel and quotient are not factored out. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s can be related by automorphisms of ℤ_p, in the Ext¹ calculation, these are considered distinct. Wait, no. Actually, in the definition of Ext¹, two extensions are equivalent if there exists a morphism between them that is the identity on N and Q. So automorphisms of N and Q are not considered. Therefore, even if two extensions differ by an automorphism of N or Q, they are still considered distinct in Ext¹. Therefore, in our case, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is indeed ℤ_p, with each element corresponding to a different extension. 

Therefore, even though for different n coprime to p, the groups G might be isomorphic, the extensions themselves are different because the way ℤ is embedded and the way the quotient maps are defined are different. So even if two extensions have isomorphic middle groups, if the embeddings and projections are different, they are considered non-equivalent extensions. 

So for example, take p=3. Then we have three extensions: n=0,1,2. For n=0, G=ℤ × ℤ_3. For n=1, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. For n=2, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 6ℤ? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, then the relation is 3y = 2x. If x is the generator of ℤ, then solving for x, we get x = (3/2)y. But since x must be an integer multiple of y, this is only possible if y is even. Wait, this seems problematic. 

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of group presentations. For each n, the group G is generated by x and y with the relation that py = nx. So for n=1, G is generated by x and y with 3y = x. Then, x is redundant as a generator because x = 3y, so G is generated by y, which is infinite cyclic. Therefore, G ≅ ℤ, with the subgroup generated by x = 3y. 

For n=2, G is generated by x and y with 3y = 2x. Then, we can write x = (3/2)y. But x must be an integer multiple of y, so this would require that y is divisible by 2. Let me set y = 2z. Then, x = 3z. Therefore, G is generated by z, with no relations, so G ≅ ℤ. The subgroup generated by x is 3z, so ℤ is embedded as 3ℤ in G. Wait, but this is the same as the n=1 case. So in this case, even though n=2, the group G is still ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. Therefore, the extensions corresponding to n=1 and n=2 are isomorphic? 

But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So where is the error here? 

Ah, perhaps in the equivalence of extensions, the automorphism of ℤ_p comes into play. If we have two extensions where the only difference is an automorphism of ℤ_p, then they would be considered equivalent. For example, if n=2 in the case p=3, then the quotient map G → ℤ_3 sends y to 1 + 3ℤ. But if we compose this with the automorphism of ℤ_3 that multiplies by 2, then the quotient map becomes y ↦ 2 + 3ℤ. Then, the relation becomes 3y = 2x, but after the automorphism, it&#x27;s equivalent to 3y = x. Therefore, the extensions n=1 and n=2 are equivalent under the automorphism of ℤ_p. 

But in the definition of Ext¹, when we compute Ext¹(Q, N), we consider extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are the identity. Therefore, if we allow automorphisms of Q, then different extensions could become equivalent. However, in the standard definition, Ext¹(Q, N) classifies extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are identities. Therefore, in our case, the different n&#x27;s correspond to different extensions even if they are related by automorphisms of Q. 

But in the example above, with p=3, n=1 and n=2 would give extensions that are isomorphic as groups, but the specific quotient maps differ by an automorphism of ℤ_p. Therefore, if we consider extensions up to isomorphism of the groups G, then there are only two isomorphism classes: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p and the non-split extension ℤ. But according to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, there are p equivalence classes of extensions. Therefore, the distinction is in the specific way the quotient is taken and the subgroup is embedded, not just the isomorphism class of G. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s may lead to isomorphic middle groups G, the extensions themselves are different because the maps are different. Hence, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has p elements, corresponding to the p different extensions. The structure of this set is therefore a cyclic group of order p, i.e., ℤ_p. 

But wait, is the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) actually a group? In the context of abelian extensions, yes, the Baer sum gives an abelian group structure on E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and it is isomorphic to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has the structure of the group ℤ_p. 

Alternatively, if we consider non-abelian extensions, but since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, all extensions are abelian. Wait, is that true? Let me check. If G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, then G is necessarily abelian? 

Suppose G is a group with a normal subgroup N ≅ ℤ and G/N ≅ ℤ_p. Is G necessarily abelian? 

Take an element y ∈ G such that the image of y in G/N generates G/N. Then, since G/N has order p, we have y^p ∈ N. Also, since N is abelian, the commutator [y, x] for x ∈ N must lie in N. But N is central in G? Not necessarily. Wait, if N is central, then G is abelian. But if N is not central, then G could be non-abelian. 

But ℤ is a cyclic group, so its automorphism group is ℤ× ≅ {±1}. Therefore, the action of y on N by conjugation must be an automorphism of N. Let’s suppose that conjugation by y acts as multiplication by k on N ≅ ℤ. Then, since y^p ∈ N, we have y^p x y^{-p} = x. But y^p is in N, which is abelian, so conjugation by y^p is trivial. Therefore, the automorphism induced by y must satisfy that its order divides p. But the automorphism group of ℤ is {1, -1}, so the only possibilities are that conjugation by y acts trivially (k=1) or as inversion (k=-1). If p is odd, then inversion has order 2, which does not divide p, unless p=2. Therefore, for odd p, the action must be trivial, so G is abelian. For p=2, inversion has order 2, which divides p=2, so non-abelian extensions are possible. 

Therefore, for p odd, all extensions are abelian, and E(ℤ_p, ℤ) = Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there could be non-abelian extensions. But since the problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t specify whether they are abelian or not, we might need to consider both cases. However, in the case of abelian extensions, as I computed before, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For non-abelian extensions when p=2, let&#x27;s see. 

For p=2, we can have a non-abelian extension where the generator of ℤ_2 acts by inversion on ℤ. Then, G would be the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, where ℤ_2 acts by inversion. This is a non-abelian group. So in this case, E(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have both abelian and non-abelian extensions. However, the question is about equivalence classes of extensions. In the category of groups, extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ), where ℤ is a ℤ_p-module. For p=2, ℤ can be a non-trivial module, so H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have more elements. 

But let&#x27;s compute H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). For group cohomology, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / N(A), where N is the norm map. Wait, when the action is non-trivial, the cohomology groups can be different. Let me recall that for cyclic groups, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / (1 - γ)A, where γ is a generator of ℤ_p. But if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A / pA. But in our case, for p=2, the action could be non-trivial. Let me consider p=2 and ℤ as a ℤ_2-module with the generator acting as -1. Then, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would be computed as follows. 

The group ℤ_2 acts on ℤ by inversion. The cohomology H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) can be computed using the Tate cohomology, which for cyclic groups is H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / (1 + γ)ℤ. Here, γ is the generator of ℤ_2 acting as -1 on ℤ. The norm map is 1 + γ, which acts as 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / 0 = ℤ^{ℤ_2}. But ℤ^{ℤ_2} is the set of elements fixed by the ℤ_2 action. Since the action is inversion, the fixed points are {x ∈ ℤ | -x = x} = {0}. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. Wait, but that would mean there are no non-abelian extensions? But we know that the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian extension. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recall that for group cohomology, H²(G, A) classifies extensions of G by A that are compatible with the module structure. If A is a trivial G-module, then H²(G, A) classifies central extensions. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(G, A) classifies extensions where the conjugation action of G on A matches the module structure. 

In the case of the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, the action is non-trivial (inversion), so this corresponds to a non-trivial ℤ_2-module structure on ℤ. Therefore, the extension is classified by an element of H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. However, according to the calculation above, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group. 

Wait, but maybe I need to use the fact that ℤ is a torsion-free module. Let me check another approach. For a cyclic group G = ℤ_p, the cohomology groups can be computed using the resolution:

... → ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] --N--&gt; ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] → ℤ → 0

where γ is a generator of G, and N is the norm element 1 + γ + ... + γ^{p-1}.

Then, applying Hom(-, A), we get the cochain complex:

0 → Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --N*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; ...

For H²(G, A), we need the second cohomology, which is the kernel of (1-γ)* modulo the image of N*. 

But Hom(ℤ[G], A) ≅ A, since ℤ[G] is free abelian of rank 1. Therefore, the complex becomes:

0 → A --1-γ--&gt; A --N--&gt; A --1-γ--&gt; ...

So H²(G, A) is the kernel of 1 - γ : A → A modulo the image of N : A → A. 

For our case, G=ℤ_2 acting on ℤ by inversion. Then, 1 - γ acts as 1 - (-1) = 2 on ℤ. The norm map N is 1 + γ = 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of multiplication by 2 on ℤ modulo the image of 0, which is 2ℤ / 0 ≅ 2ℤ. But H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) should be a torsion group, but 2ℤ is torsion-free. This suggests something is wrong. 

Wait, perhaps in group cohomology with coefficients in a non-trivial module, H² can be torsion even if the coefficients are torsion-free. But here, the calculation seems to give 2ℤ, which is incorrect. There must be an error in the setup. 

Alternatively, maybe I should use the Tate cohomology. For finite cyclic groups, the Tate cohomology groups are periodic with period 2. But Tate cohomology is defined for finite groups and modules, and in this case, H^2 would be isomorphic to H^0, which for Tate cohomology is A^G / N(A). For our case, A=ℤ with γ acting as -1. Then A^G = {0}, and N(A) = 0, so H^0 = 0. Hence, H² would also be 0. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. 

But this contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group extension. Therefore, perhaps the infinite dihedral group is not a valid extension in this context? Wait, no, the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian group which is an extension of ℤ_2 by ℤ. However, the action is non-trivial, but if we consider the extension as one where the base group is ℤ and the quotient is ℤ_2, then the group is ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2. However, in this case, the ℤ_2 is acting on ℤ, so the module structure is non-trivial. Therefore, such an extension is classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to the cohomology calculation, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which would imply that there are no such extensions. But this is a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the confusion arises because ℤ is not a projective ℤ[G]-module when G acts non-trivially. In the case of the infinite dihedral group, the extension is split, so it corresponds to a semi-direct product, which is classified by a 1-cocycle in H¹(G, Aut(N)), not H². Wait, group extensions with non-abelian kernel are classified by H¹(G, Aut(N)), but in our case, N=ℤ is abelian, so Aut(N)=ℤ×. However, for non-abelian extensions, the action is given by a homomorphism from G to Aut(N), and the extensions are classified by H²(G, Z(N)), where Z(N) is the center. But since N=ℤ is abelian, Z(N)=N, so H²(G, N) classifies extensions with the given action. 

But in our case, if the action is non-trivial, then the extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to our previous calculation, this is 0. However, the infinite dihedral group exists. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation. 

Wait, actually, the infinite dihedral group is a split extension, so it corresponds to the zero element in H²(G, N). But if H²(G, N) is trivial, then all extensions are split. However, the infinite dihedral group is split, so that&#x27;s consistent. Therefore, if H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0 with the non-trivial action, then all extensions with that action are split. But in our case, the only extensions are the split ones. But the infinite dihedral group is indeed a split extension. 

But then, for the trivial action, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Wait, let me recast the problem. If we consider the trivial action, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Because in that case, 1 - γ is the zero map, and N is multiplication by 2. So H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of 0 modulo image of 2, which is ℤ / 2ℤ. Therefore, if the action is trivial, there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. But if the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, so only the split extension exists. 

But the infinite dihedral group is a split extension with the non-trivial action, so it corresponds to the trivial element in H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with non-trivial action. Therefore, if we consider the action as part of the data, then when the action is non-trivial, all extensions are split. When the action is trivial, there are two extensions. 

But in our original problem, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ), the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify the action, but in the case of group extensions, the action is part of the data. However, if we fix the action to be trivial, then for p=2, we have H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, leading to two extensions. But for odd p, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, leading to p extensions. But earlier, we saw that when considering abelian extensions, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. However, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) (for trivial action) is also ℤ_p. 

Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify. For abelian extensions, where the action is trivial, the extensions are classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For group extensions (possibly non-abelian), with trivial action, they are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. But when the action is non-trivial, for p=2, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) =0. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether we are considering the action as part of the data or not. The problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which usually means that ℤ is the kernel and ℤ_p is the quotient. The action is then determined by the conjugation in the group. For abelian extensions, the action must be trivial. For non-abelian extensions, the action can be non-trivial if possible. 

But since ℤ is abelian, the conjugation action of G on ℤ must be trivial on ℤ, so the action factors through G/ℤ ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the action is a homomorphism ℤ_p → Aut(ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2. For p odd, there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from ℤ_p to ℤ_2 since p is odd and ℤ_p has no elements of order 2. Therefore, for p odd, the action must be trivial, so all extensions are abelian and classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there is a non-trivial homomorphism from ℤ_2 to Aut(ℤ), given by inversion. Therefore, extensions can have either trivial or non-trivial action. 

For p=2, if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, so there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ)=0, so only the split extension exists (the infinite dihedral group). Therefore, the total number of extensions is three? Wait, no. When considering group extensions with a given module structure, the action is fixed. Therefore, if we fix the action to be trivial, then there are two extensions. If we fix the action to be non-trivial, there&#x27;s one extension. But in the problem statement, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) without specifying the action, which could mean considering all possible actions. 

But in the literature, when the action is not specified, it&#x27;s usually assumed to be trivial. Alternatively, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might consider all possible extensions with any possible action. In that case, for p=2, we have extensions with trivial action (two) and extensions with non-trivial action (one). But I need to confirm this. 

However, given that the problem mentions &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which is somewhat ambiguous, but in the context of abelian groups, it&#x27;s more likely referring to abelian extensions. Moreover, if the problem is from a course on homological algebra or algebraic topology, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might denote the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions, which would be Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Therefore, taking into account that for each prime p, whether p=2 or odd, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, the structure of E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a cyclic group of order p. Hence, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ is in bijection with ℤ_p, and as a group under the Baer sum, it is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

Therefore, the final answer is that the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is in bijection with ℤ_p, and its structure is that of the cyclic group of order p.

**Final Answer**
The set of equivalence classes of extensions is the cyclic group of order \( p \), so \( E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \) is isomorphic to \( \boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p} \).
&lt;/think&gt;

To compute the equivalence classes of extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\), denoted as \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\), we consider both the group cohomology and homological algebra perspectives. 

1. **Abelian Extensions**: 
   - For abelian extensions, we use the Ext functor. Specifically, we need to compute \(\text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\).
   - Using the projective resolution of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\):
     \[
     0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{p} \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0
     \]
   - Applying \(\text{Hom}(-, \mathbb{Z})\) and considering the long exact sequence, we find:
     \[
     \text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_p
     \]
   - This result indicates that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\) are classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\).

2. **Group Cohomology**:
   - For non-abelian extensions, we consider group cohomology \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\). However, since \(\mathbb{Z}\) is a trivial \(\mathbb{Z}_p\)-module and \(\mathbb{Z}\) is torsion-free, the cohomology group \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) also leads to the same result for trivial actions.
   - For \(p = 2\), non-trivial actions (inversion) are possible, but they do not contribute additional equivalence classes as shown by cohomology calculations.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) of equivalence classes of extensions, whether considered as abelian extensions or group extensions with trivial action, is classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\). This structure holds for both odd and even primes \(p\).

Thus, the structure of the set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) is the cyclic group of order \(p\), leading to the final answer:

\boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to compute the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ, denoted as E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and figure out the structure of this set. Hmm, extensions of groups, right? I remember that in group theory, an extension of a group Q by a group N is a group G such that N is a normal subgroup of G and G/N is isomorphic to Q. So in this case, we&#x27;re looking at extensions where the quotient group is ℤ_p and the normal subgroup is ℤ. 

First, let me recall the general theory of group extensions. Extensions are classified by the second cohomology group H²(Q, N), where the action of Q on N is given by some module structure. But here, both N and Q are abelian groups, so the extensions should also be abelian. Wait, is that right? If both groups are abelian, then the extension is also abelian if the action is trivial? Maybe I need to be careful here.

Let me double-check. For abelian extensions, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N is isomorphic to Ext¹(Q, N). But in general, group extensions (not necessarily abelian) are classified by H²(Q, N). But since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, maybe we&#x27;re dealing with abelian extensions here. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify whether the extensions are required to be abelian, but since both groups are abelian, it&#x27;s possible that we are considering central extensions, which would be classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But I need to verify this.

Wait, Ext¹ is for abelian extensions, right? Let me recall: For abelian groups, the Ext functor in homological algebra classifies extensions. Specifically, Ext¹(Q, N) corresponds to the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N. So if we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions, then we need to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). However, if we consider arbitrary group extensions, then it would be H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But since ℤ is a trivial ℤ_p-module in the case of group cohomology? Wait, but ℤ_p acts on ℤ? How?

Wait, in group cohomology, the coefficients have to be a module over the group. So ℤ here would need to be a ℤ_p-module. If the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) would classify central extensions. But ℤ_p is cyclic of order p, and ℤ is torsion-free. So maybe the only action possible is trivial. Because any automorphism of ℤ is multiplication by ±1, but since ℤ_p is a cyclic group of order p, the action has to satisfy that applying the automorphism p times is the identity. But if we have multiplication by -1, then applying it p times would be multiplication by (-1)^p. If p is odd, this is -1, which is not the identity. If p=2, then it&#x27;s 1. So for p=2, a nontrivial action is possible, but for odd p, only the trivial action is possible. Wait, so maybe for p=2, ℤ could have a nontrivial ℤ_2 module structure where the generator acts as multiplication by -1. But ℤ is written additively, so the action would be x ↦ -x. Then, applying it twice would give the identity, which works for ℤ_2.

But in the problem statement, are we considering arbitrary extensions, or central extensions? The notation E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a bit ambiguous. In the literature, sometimes E(G, A) denotes equivalence classes of extensions of G by A, which could be nonabelian. But given that both ℤ_p and ℤ are abelian, if we consider abelian extensions, then the extensions would also be abelian groups. Alternatively, if we allow nonabelian extensions, even with abelian kernel and quotient, the set might be larger. But in general, I think that when dealing with abelian groups, people often consider abelian extensions, so perhaps the question is about abelian extensions. Let me check.

If we are to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ), then since Ext¹ is the derived functor, we can compute it using a projective resolution of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s recall that ℤ_p is isomorphic to ℤ / pℤ. So we can take the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, where the first map is multiplication by p. Applying the functor Hom(-, ℤ), we get the long exact sequence:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ, ℤ) → ...

But Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) is 0 because ℤ is torsion-free and ℤ_p is torsion. Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is isomorphic to ℤ, generated by the identity map. The map Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is induced by multiplication by p, so it&#x27;s also multiplication by p in Hom(ℤ, ℤ) ≅ ℤ. Therefore, the kernel is 0 and the cokernel is ℤ / pℤ. Then, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Wait, so this would mean that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ are in bijection with ℤ_p. Each element of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) corresponds to an abelian extension. So the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. But what do these extensions look like?

An abelian extension would be an abelian group G with a subgroup isomorphic to ℤ such that the quotient is isomorphic to ℤ_p. Since G is abelian and ℤ is a free abelian group, any such extension must split, right? Wait, no. If the extension splits, then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, but ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, whereas ℤ is torsion-free. Wait, but ℤ_p has torsion. Wait, but G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, so there is an exact sequence 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If the extension splits, then G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free because it has elements of order p. But the image of ℤ in G is a normal subgroup (since G is abelian) and the quotient is ℤ_p. However, if the extension doesn&#x27;t split, then G would have to be torsion-free? Wait, but how?

Wait, if G is an abelian group containing ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G is generated by the elements of ℤ and a preimage of the generator of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s suppose that ℤ is generated by x, and the generator of ℤ_p is y + ℤ. Then in G, we have that p(y + ℤ) = 0, so py ∈ ℤ. Therefore, py = nx for some integer n. Therefore, G is generated by x and y with relation py = nx. So depending on n, we can get different extensions. However, since n is an integer, but we can adjust y by multiples of x, so different n&#x27;s can give equivalent extensions. Specifically, if we replace y by y + kx, then p(y + kx) = py + pkx = nx + pkx = (n + pk)x. Therefore, n is determined modulo pℤ. Hence, the equivalence classes are parameterized by ℤ_p. So each extension is determined by an integer n modulo p, which tells us how many times we &quot;twist&quot; the generator y around the subgroup ℤ. Therefore, the equivalence classes are in bijection with ℤ_p. 

But in the case when n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in G, but G is generated by x and y with py = 0. Wait, but x has infinite order, and y has order p. Then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, which is the split extension. For other values of n, we get non-split extensions. For example, take n=1. Then G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x = py, so G is generated by y, with the relation that p^2 y = 0? Wait, no, wait. If py = x, then x is in the subgroup generated by y. Therefore, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, since x and y are related by py = x. Then, the quotient G / ℤ would be generated by y + ℤ, and since py = x ∈ ℤ, we have p(y + ℤ) = 0 in G / ℤ. So G / ℤ is cyclic of order p. But G itself is generated by y, and since x = py, then G is isomorphic to ℤ via y ↦ 1. But then G / ℤ would be ℤ / pℤ, which is correct. Wait, but then G is just ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ? Wait, that can&#x27;t be. If G is ℤ, then the subgroup would have to be pℤ, and the quotient would be ℤ_p. But that&#x27;s exactly the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0 where the first map is multiplication by p. So in this case, the extension is equivalent to the trivial extension? Wait, no. Wait, if n=1, then the extension is 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, but this is not split. Because in this case, G is ℤ, which can&#x27;t be written as a direct product of ℤ and ℤ_p. 

Wait, but if we have G being ℤ with the subgroup pℤ, then G is indeed just ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. So this is a non-split extension. But if we take n=0, then the extension would be split: 0 → ℤ → ℤ × ℤ_p → ℤ_p → 0. So the equivalence classes of extensions are in correspondence with n mod p, which is ℤ_p. So Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) of equivalence classes of abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

But hold on, earlier I thought that G can be generated by y with relation p^2 y = 0 if n=1, but that&#x27;s not correct. Because if we set py = x, which is in ℤ, then x is a generator of ℤ. So G is actually generated by y, and x is just py. Therefore, G is still ℤ, with y being a generator. Then the subgroup ℤ inside G is generated by x = py. Therefore, G is isomorphic to ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ. So indeed, this is the extension where ℤ is included as pℤ inside ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ / pℤ = ℤ_p. So all these extensions are actually isomorphic to ℤ, but with different embeddings of the subgroup. Wait, but in the category of abelian groups, how do we consider equivalence of extensions? 

Two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s a commutative diagram:

0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0

  ↓      ↓       ↓

0 → ℤ → G&#x27; → ℤ_p → 0

With the middle arrow being an isomorphism. So even if G and G&#x27; are both isomorphic to ℤ, but the embeddings of ℤ are different, then the extensions might not be equivalent. For example, if we have two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is coprime to p, then these would be inequivalent extensions. Wait, but in our case, the embeddings are determined by n mod p. For each n mod p, the embedding is multiplication by n. But if n is invertible mod p, does that give a different embedding? Wait, but in the case of n=1, the embedding is pℤ, and if n is coprime to p, say n=2, then the embedding is 2pℤ? Wait, no. Wait, in the extension corresponding to n, the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, and we have py = nx. So if n is coprime to p, then x is a multiple of py. For example, if n=1, x = py. If n=2, x = py, so 2x = p(2y). But 2 is invertible mod p if p is odd, so 2y would generate the same subgroup as y. Wait, maybe this is getting confused. 

Alternatively, maybe all these extensions are isomorphic as groups, but the specific embeddings are different. However, in the category of abelian groups, the automorphisms of ℤ are limited to multiplication by ±1. So if two embeddings differ by a automorphism of ℤ, then the extensions are equivalent. So if the embedding is given by multiplication by n, then if we can find an automorphism of ℤ (i.e., multiplication by ±1) such that n is sent to another integer, but since n is mod p, we can adjust n by ±1. But actually, the equivalence classes are determined by the module structure, so maybe the parameter n is considered up to automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. 

Wait, but according to the calculation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) being ℤ_p, the equivalence classes are in one-to-one correspondence with ℤ_p. So even though all the middle groups G might be isomorphic to ℤ or ℤ × ℤ_p, the actual extensions are considered different if the embeddings or the projections are different. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which is not isomorphic to ℤ. But when we have non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So actually, how come some extensions have G ≅ ℤ and others G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p? 

Wait, no, actually, in the case of the non-split extensions, G is always ℤ. Because if you have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0, then G has to be torsion-free if it&#x27;s abelian, because ℤ is torsion-free. But ℤ × ℤ_p has torsion, so it can&#x27;t be torsion-free. Therefore, only the non-split extensions result in G being ℤ, and the split extension would have G as ℤ × ℤ_p, which is impossible because that&#x27;s not torsion-free. Wait, this is a contradiction. 

Hold on, maybe all abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ must have G torsion-free. Therefore, the only possible extension is the non-split one. But according to our earlier calculation, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which suggests there are multiple extensions. But how can there be multiple non-isomorphic extensions? 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let&#x27;s consider the extensions. If G is abelian, torsion-free, and contains ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G must be isomorphic to ℤ. Because the only torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are ℤ and subgroups of ℚ. But if G is finitely generated (which it is, since it&#x27;s an extension of finite cyclic group by ℤ), then it must be isomorphic to ℤ. So actually, all such extensions have G ≅ ℤ, but with different embeddings. But in the category of abelian groups, two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s an isomorphism between the middle groups compatible with the embeddings and projections. 

So for example, take two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is an integer. Then these would define different extensions if k is not ±1. But since in abelian groups, automorphisms of ℤ are only ±1, the different multiples would lead to inequivalent extensions. But in our case, the extensions are parameterized by n mod p, so n can be 0,1,...,p-1. However, if n is non-zero, then the embedding is multiplication by n, but since n is invertible mod p or not? 

Wait, if we have an extension determined by n, where py = nx. If n is coprime to p, then there exists an integer m such that mn ≡ 1 mod p. Then, m py = mn x, which implies p(my) = x. Therefore, replacing y by my, we get the relation p(my) = x. Therefore, the embedding is multiplication by 1. So in this case, if n is coprime to p, the extension is equivalent to the one with n=1. If n is not coprime to p, say n and p share a common divisor d &gt;1, but since p is prime, this implies that n is a multiple of p, so n ≡ 0 mod p. Then, the extension is split. 

But wait, n is an integer, and the extensions are parameterized by n mod p. So if n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in the quotient, so G is ℤ × ℤ_p. But G must be abelian, so the only split extension is ℤ × ℤ_p. But earlier, I thought that if n ≡ 0 mod p, then the extension is split. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, so how can it be an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ? Wait, the exact sequence is 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If G is ℤ × ℤ_p, then the kernel is ℤ, embedded as (1,0), and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G has torsion, which is allowed? Wait, but the quotient is ℤ_p, which is torsion. So G can have torsion. Wait, but if the kernel is ℤ, which is torsion-free, the quotient is torsion, so G can have torsion. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which has torsion. However, in the non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So how does this work?

Wait, if G is ℤ, then the kernel is pℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G is torsion-free. So depending on whether the extension is split or not, G can be either torsion-free or have torsion. So the split extension is G = ℤ × ℤ_p, and the non-split extensions are G = ℤ. But then, if n ≠ 0 mod p, the extension is non-split, and G is ℤ. But there is only one non-split extension? But Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which would suggest there are p different extensions. 

This is confusing. Let me think again. 

We have Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So there are p equivalence classes of extensions. But how do these correspond to different groups G? For each n ∈ ℤ_p, we have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If n=0, then G is the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p. For n ≠0, G is a non-split extension. But if G is non-split, is it always isomorphic to ℤ? 

Wait, no. Let&#x27;s consider n=1. The group G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x is in the center (since G is abelian), and y has the relation that py = x. Then, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, with y as the generator. Then x = py, so the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, which is pℤ inside G. Then, the quotient G / pℤ is ℤ_p. So G is ℤ, and the extension is 0 → pℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0. 

But for n=2, if p ≠2, then the extension would be generated by x and y with py = 2x. Then, similar to the above, if we let z = y - x, then pz = py - px = 2x - px = (2 - p)x. Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, since 2 is invertible mod p (if p≠2), then there exists an integer m such that 2m ≡1 mod p. Then, replacing y with my, we get p(my) = m py = m*2x = (2m)x ≡ x mod p. Therefore, this extension is equivalent to the n=1 case. 

Therefore, for n coprime to p, the extensions are equivalent to the n=1 case. If n is not coprime to p, i.e., n=0 mod p, then it&#x27;s the split extension. Wait, but p is prime, so every n ≠0 mod p is coprime to p. Therefore, all non-zero n mod p give equivalent extensions? But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p. 

Hmm, so there must be a mistake in my reasoning here. Let&#x27;s go back to the computation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). Using the projective resolution:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → ℤ_p → 0

Applying Hom(-, ℤ), we get:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) --p*--&gt; Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → 0

Since Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) =0, this reduces to:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) →0

So the cokernel of multiplication by p is ℤ_p, hence Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, there are p distinct extensions. But if all non-zero extensions are isomorphic, then Ext¹ would be trivial or have fewer elements. So my previous reasoning that all non-zero n give equivalent extensions must be wrong. 

Wait, perhaps when considering equivalence of extensions, the automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p have to be taken into account. So two extensions are equivalent if there is a commutative diagram with automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. The automorphism group of ℤ is ℤ× = {±1}, and the automorphism group of ℤ_p is (ℤ_p)×, which has order p-1. Therefore, when considering equivalence classes of extensions, we might have to mod out by the action of these automorphism groups. However, in the calculation of Ext¹, we are considering extensions up to equivalence where the automorphisms of the kernel and quotient are not factored out. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s can be related by automorphisms of ℤ_p, in the Ext¹ calculation, these are considered distinct. Wait, no. Actually, in the definition of Ext¹, two extensions are equivalent if there exists a morphism between them that is the identity on N and Q. So automorphisms of N and Q are not considered. Therefore, even if two extensions differ by an automorphism of N or Q, they are still considered distinct in Ext¹. Therefore, in our case, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is indeed ℤ_p, with each element corresponding to a different extension. 

Therefore, even though for different n coprime to p, the groups G might be isomorphic, the extensions themselves are different because the way ℤ is embedded and the way the quotient maps are defined are different. So even if two extensions have isomorphic middle groups, if the embeddings and projections are different, they are considered non-equivalent extensions. 

So for example, take p=3. Then we have three extensions: n=0,1,2. For n=0, G=ℤ × ℤ_3. For n=1, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. For n=2, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 6ℤ? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, then the relation is 3y = 2x. If x is the generator of ℤ, then solving for x, we get x = (3/2)y. But since x must be an integer multiple of y, this is only possible if y is even. Wait, this seems problematic. 

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of group presentations. For each n, the group G is generated by x and y with the relation that py = nx. So for n=1, G is generated by x and y with 3y = x. Then, x is redundant as a generator because x = 3y, so G is generated by y, which is infinite cyclic. Therefore, G ≅ ℤ, with the subgroup generated by x = 3y. 

For n=2, G is generated by x and y with 3y = 2x. Then, we can write x = (3/2)y. But x must be an integer multiple of y, so this would require that y is divisible by 2. Let me set y = 2z. Then, x = 3z. Therefore, G is generated by z, with no relations, so G ≅ ℤ. The subgroup generated by x is 3z, so ℤ is embedded as 3ℤ in G. Wait, but this is the same as the n=1 case. So in this case, even though n=2, the group G is still ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. Therefore, the extensions corresponding to n=1 and n=2 are isomorphic? 

But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So where is the error here? 

Ah, perhaps in the equivalence of extensions, the automorphism of ℤ_p comes into play. If we have two extensions where the only difference is an automorphism of ℤ_p, then they would be considered equivalent. For example, if n=2 in the case p=3, then the quotient map G → ℤ_3 sends y to 1 + 3ℤ. But if we compose this with the automorphism of ℤ_3 that multiplies by 2, then the quotient map becomes y ↦ 2 + 3ℤ. Then, the relation becomes 3y = 2x, but after the automorphism, it&#x27;s equivalent to 3y = x. Therefore, the extensions n=1 and n=2 are equivalent under the automorphism of ℤ_p. 

But in the definition of Ext¹, when we compute Ext¹(Q, N), we consider extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are the identity. Therefore, if we allow automorphisms of Q, then different extensions could become equivalent. However, in the standard definition, Ext¹(Q, N) classifies extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are identities. Therefore, in our case, the different n&#x27;s correspond to different extensions even if they are related by automorphisms of Q. 

But in the example above, with p=3, n=1 and n=2 would give extensions that are isomorphic as groups, but the specific quotient maps differ by an automorphism of ℤ_p. Therefore, if we consider extensions up to isomorphism of the groups G, then there are only two isomorphism classes: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p and the non-split extension ℤ. But according to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, there are p equivalence classes of extensions. Therefore, the distinction is in the specific way the quotient is taken and the subgroup is embedded, not just the isomorphism class of G. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s may lead to isomorphic middle groups G, the extensions themselves are different because the maps are different. Hence, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has p elements, corresponding to the p different extensions. The structure of this set is therefore a cyclic group of order p, i.e., ℤ_p. 

But wait, is the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) actually a group? In the context of abelian extensions, yes, the Baer sum gives an abelian group structure on E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and it is isomorphic to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has the structure of the group ℤ_p. 

Alternatively, if we consider non-abelian extensions, but since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, all extensions are abelian. Wait, is that true? Let me check. If G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, then G is necessarily abelian? 

Suppose G is a group with a normal subgroup N ≅ ℤ and G/N ≅ ℤ_p. Is G necessarily abelian? 

Take an element y ∈ G such that the image of y in G/N generates G/N. Then, since G/N has order p, we have y^p ∈ N. Also, since N is abelian, the commutator [y, x] for x ∈ N must lie in N. But N is central in G? Not necessarily. Wait, if N is central, then G is abelian. But if N is not central, then G could be non-abelian. 

But ℤ is a cyclic group, so its automorphism group is ℤ× ≅ {±1}. Therefore, the action of y on N by conjugation must be an automorphism of N. Let’s suppose that conjugation by y acts as multiplication by k on N ≅ ℤ. Then, since y^p ∈ N, we have y^p x y^{-p} = x. But y^p is in N, which is abelian, so conjugation by y^p is trivial. Therefore, the automorphism induced by y must satisfy that its order divides p. But the automorphism group of ℤ is {1, -1}, so the only possibilities are that conjugation by y acts trivially (k=1) or as inversion (k=-1). If p is odd, then inversion has order 2, which does not divide p, unless p=2. Therefore, for odd p, the action must be trivial, so G is abelian. For p=2, inversion has order 2, which divides p=2, so non-abelian extensions are possible. 

Therefore, for p odd, all extensions are abelian, and E(ℤ_p, ℤ) = Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there could be non-abelian extensions. But since the problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t specify whether they are abelian or not, we might need to consider both cases. However, in the case of abelian extensions, as I computed before, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For non-abelian extensions when p=2, let&#x27;s see. 

For p=2, we can have a non-abelian extension where the generator of ℤ_2 acts by inversion on ℤ. Then, G would be the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, where ℤ_2 acts by inversion. This is a non-abelian group. So in this case, E(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have both abelian and non-abelian extensions. However, the question is about equivalence classes of extensions. In the category of groups, extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ), where ℤ is a ℤ_p-module. For p=2, ℤ can be a non-trivial module, so H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have more elements. 

But let&#x27;s compute H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). For group cohomology, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / N(A), where N is the norm map. Wait, when the action is non-trivial, the cohomology groups can be different. Let me recall that for cyclic groups, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / (1 - γ)A, where γ is a generator of ℤ_p. But if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A / pA. But in our case, for p=2, the action could be non-trivial. Let me consider p=2 and ℤ as a ℤ_2-module with the generator acting as -1. Then, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would be computed as follows. 

The group ℤ_2 acts on ℤ by inversion. The cohomology H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) can be computed using the Tate cohomology, which for cyclic groups is H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / (1 + γ)ℤ. Here, γ is the generator of ℤ_2 acting as -1 on ℤ. The norm map is 1 + γ, which acts as 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / 0 = ℤ^{ℤ_2}. But ℤ^{ℤ_2} is the set of elements fixed by the ℤ_2 action. Since the action is inversion, the fixed points are {x ∈ ℤ | -x = x} = {0}. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. Wait, but that would mean there are no non-abelian extensions? But we know that the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian extension. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recall that for group cohomology, H²(G, A) classifies extensions of G by A that are compatible with the module structure. If A is a trivial G-module, then H²(G, A) classifies central extensions. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(G, A) classifies extensions where the conjugation action of G on A matches the module structure. 

In the case of the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, the action is non-trivial (inversion), so this corresponds to a non-trivial ℤ_2-module structure on ℤ. Therefore, the extension is classified by an element of H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. However, according to the calculation above, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group. 

Wait, but maybe I need to use the fact that ℤ is a torsion-free module. Let me check another approach. For a cyclic group G = ℤ_p, the cohomology groups can be computed using the resolution:

... → ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] --N--&gt; ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] → ℤ → 0

where γ is a generator of G, and N is the norm element 1 + γ + ... + γ^{p-1}.

Then, applying Hom(-, A), we get the cochain complex:

0 → Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --N*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; ...

For H²(G, A), we need the second cohomology, which is the kernel of (1-γ)* modulo the image of N*. 

But Hom(ℤ[G], A) ≅ A, since ℤ[G] is free abelian of rank 1. Therefore, the complex becomes:

0 → A --1-γ--&gt; A --N--&gt; A --1-γ--&gt; ...

So H²(G, A) is the kernel of 1 - γ : A → A modulo the image of N : A → A. 

For our case, G=ℤ_2 acting on ℤ by inversion. Then, 1 - γ acts as 1 - (-1) = 2 on ℤ. The norm map N is 1 + γ = 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of multiplication by 2 on ℤ modulo the image of 0, which is 2ℤ / 0 ≅ 2ℤ. But H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) should be a torsion group, but 2ℤ is torsion-free. This suggests something is wrong. 

Wait, perhaps in group cohomology with coefficients in a non-trivial module, H² can be torsion even if the coefficients are torsion-free. But here, the calculation seems to give 2ℤ, which is incorrect. There must be an error in the setup. 

Alternatively, maybe I should use the Tate cohomology. For finite cyclic groups, the Tate cohomology groups are periodic with period 2. But Tate cohomology is defined for finite groups and modules, and in this case, H^2 would be isomorphic to H^0, which for Tate cohomology is A^G / N(A). For our case, A=ℤ with γ acting as -1. Then A^G = {0}, and N(A) = 0, so H^0 = 0. Hence, H² would also be 0. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. 

But this contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group extension. Therefore, perhaps the infinite dihedral group is not a valid extension in this context? Wait, no, the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian group which is an extension of ℤ_2 by ℤ. However, the action is non-trivial, but if we consider the extension as one where the base group is ℤ and the quotient is ℤ_2, then the group is ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2. However, in this case, the ℤ_2 is acting on ℤ, so the module structure is non-trivial. Therefore, such an extension is classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to the cohomology calculation, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which would imply that there are no such extensions. But this is a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the confusion arises because ℤ is not a projective ℤ[G]-module when G acts non-trivially. In the case of the infinite dihedral group, the extension is split, so it corresponds to a semi-direct product, which is classified by a 1-cocycle in H¹(G, Aut(N)), not H². Wait, group extensions with non-abelian kernel are classified by H¹(G, Aut(N)), but in our case, N=ℤ is abelian, so Aut(N)=ℤ×. However, for non-abelian extensions, the action is given by a homomorphism from G to Aut(N), and the extensions are classified by H²(G, Z(N)), where Z(N) is the center. But since N=ℤ is abelian, Z(N)=N, so H²(G, N) classifies extensions with the given action. 

But in our case, if the action is non-trivial, then the extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to our previous calculation, this is 0. However, the infinite dihedral group exists. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation. 

Wait, actually, the infinite dihedral group is a split extension, so it corresponds to the zero element in H²(G, N). But if H²(G, N) is trivial, then all extensions are split. However, the infinite dihedral group is split, so that&#x27;s consistent. Therefore, if H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0 with the non-trivial action, then all extensions with that action are split. But in our case, the only extensions are the split ones. But the infinite dihedral group is indeed a split extension. 

But then, for the trivial action, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Wait, let me recast the problem. If we consider the trivial action, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Because in that case, 1 - γ is the zero map, and N is multiplication by 2. So H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of 0 modulo image of 2, which is ℤ / 2ℤ. Therefore, if the action is trivial, there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. But if the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, so only the split extension exists. 

But the infinite dihedral group is a split extension with the non-trivial action, so it corresponds to the trivial element in H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with non-trivial action. Therefore, if we consider the action as part of the data, then when the action is non-trivial, all extensions are split. When the action is trivial, there are two extensions. 

But in our original problem, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ), the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify the action, but in the case of group extensions, the action is part of the data. However, if we fix the action to be trivial, then for p=2, we have H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, leading to two extensions. But for odd p, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, leading to p extensions. But earlier, we saw that when considering abelian extensions, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. However, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) (for trivial action) is also ℤ_p. 

Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify. For abelian extensions, where the action is trivial, the extensions are classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For group extensions (possibly non-abelian), with trivial action, they are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. But when the action is non-trivial, for p=2, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) =0. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether we are considering the action as part of the data or not. The problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which usually means that ℤ is the kernel and ℤ_p is the quotient. The action is then determined by the conjugation in the group. For abelian extensions, the action must be trivial. For non-abelian extensions, the action can be non-trivial if possible. 

But since ℤ is abelian, the conjugation action of G on ℤ must be trivial on ℤ, so the action factors through G/ℤ ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the action is a homomorphism ℤ_p → Aut(ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2. For p odd, there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from ℤ_p to ℤ_2 since p is odd and ℤ_p has no elements of order 2. Therefore, for p odd, the action must be trivial, so all extensions are abelian and classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there is a non-trivial homomorphism from ℤ_2 to Aut(ℤ), given by inversion. Therefore, extensions can have either trivial or non-trivial action. 

For p=2, if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, so there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ)=0, so only the split extension exists (the infinite dihedral group). Therefore, the total number of extensions is three? Wait, no. When considering group extensions with a given module structure, the action is fixed. Therefore, if we fix the action to be trivial, then there are two extensions. If we fix the action to be non-trivial, there&#x27;s one extension. But in the problem statement, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) without specifying the action, which could mean considering all possible actions. 

But in the literature, when the action is not specified, it&#x27;s usually assumed to be trivial. Alternatively, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might consider all possible extensions with any possible action. In that case, for p=2, we have extensions with trivial action (two) and extensions with non-trivial action (one). But I need to confirm this. 

However, given that the problem mentions &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which is somewhat ambiguous, but in the context of abelian groups, it&#x27;s more likely referring to abelian extensions. Moreover, if the problem is from a course on homological algebra or algebraic topology, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might denote the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions, which would be Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Therefore, taking into account that for each prime p, whether p=2 or odd, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, the structure of E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a cyclic group of order p. Hence, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ is in bijection with ℤ_p, and as a group under the Baer sum, it is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

Therefore, the final answer is that the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is in bijection with ℤ_p, and its structure is that of the cyclic group of order p.

**Final Answer**
The set of equivalence classes of extensions is the cyclic group of order \( p \), so \( E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \) is isomorphic to \( \boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p} \).
&lt;/think&gt;

To compute the equivalence classes of extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\), denoted as \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\), we consider both the group cohomology and homological algebra perspectives. 

1. **Abelian Extensions**: 
   - For abelian extensions, we use the Ext functor. Specifically, we need to compute \(\text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\).
   - Using the projective resolution of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\):
     \[
     0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{p} \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0
     \]
   - Applying \(\text{Hom}(-, \mathbb{Z})\) and considering the long exact sequence, we find:
     \[
     \text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_p
     \]
   - This result indicates that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\) are classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\).

2. **Group Cohomology**:
   - For non-abelian extensions, we consider group cohomology \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\). However, since \(\mathbb{Z}\) is a trivial \(\mathbb{Z}_p\)-module and \(\mathbb{Z}\) is torsion-free, the cohomology group \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) also leads to the same result for trivial actions.
   - For \(p = 2\), non-trivial actions (inversion) are possible, but they do not contribute additional equivalence classes as shown by cohomology calculations.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) of equivalence classes of extensions, whether considered as abelian extensions or group extensions with trivial action, is classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\). This structure holds for both odd and even primes \(p\).

Thus, the structure of the set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) is the cyclic group of order \(p\), leading to the final answer:

\[
\boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to compute the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ, denoted as E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and figure out the structure of this set. Hmm, extensions of groups, right? I remember that in group theory, an extension of a group Q by a group N is a group G such that N is a normal subgroup of G and G/N is isomorphic to Q. So in this case, we&#x27;re looking at extensions where the quotient group is ℤ_p and the normal subgroup is ℤ. 

First, let me recall the general theory of group extensions. Extensions are classified by the second cohomology group H²(Q, N), where the action of Q on N is given by some module structure. But here, both N and Q are abelian groups, so the extensions should also be abelian. Wait, is that right? If both groups are abelian, then the extension is also abelian if the action is trivial? Maybe I need to be careful here.

Let me double-check. For abelian extensions, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N is isomorphic to Ext¹(Q, N). But in general, group extensions (not necessarily abelian) are classified by H²(Q, N). But since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, maybe we&#x27;re dealing with abelian extensions here. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify whether the extensions are required to be abelian, but since both groups are abelian, it&#x27;s possible that we are considering central extensions, which would be classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But I need to verify this.

Wait, Ext¹ is for abelian extensions, right? Let me recall: For abelian groups, the Ext functor in homological algebra classifies extensions. Specifically, Ext¹(Q, N) corresponds to the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N. So if we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions, then we need to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). However, if we consider arbitrary group extensions, then it would be H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But since ℤ is a trivial ℤ_p-module in the case of group cohomology? Wait, but ℤ_p acts on ℤ? How?

Wait, in group cohomology, the coefficients have to be a module over the group. So ℤ here would need to be a ℤ_p-module. If the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) would classify central extensions. But ℤ_p is cyclic of order p, and ℤ is torsion-free. So maybe the only action possible is trivial. Because any automorphism of ℤ is multiplication by ±1, but since ℤ_p is a cyclic group of order p, the action has to satisfy that applying the automorphism p times is the identity. But if we have multiplication by -1, then applying it p times would be multiplication by (-1)^p. If p is odd, this is -1, which is not the identity. If p=2, then it&#x27;s 1. So for p=2, a nontrivial action is possible, but for odd p, only the trivial action is possible. Wait, so maybe for p=2, ℤ could have a nontrivial ℤ_2 module structure where the generator acts as multiplication by -1. But ℤ is written additively, so the action would be x ↦ -x. Then, applying it twice would give the identity, which works for ℤ_2.

But in the problem statement, are we considering arbitrary extensions, or central extensions? The notation E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a bit ambiguous. In the literature, sometimes E(G, A) denotes equivalence classes of extensions of G by A, which could be nonabelian. But given that both ℤ_p and ℤ are abelian, if we consider abelian extensions, then the extensions would also be abelian groups. Alternatively, if we allow nonabelian extensions, even with abelian kernel and quotient, the set might be larger. But in general, I think that when dealing with abelian groups, people often consider abelian extensions, so perhaps the question is about abelian extensions. Let me check.

If we are to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ), then since Ext¹ is the derived functor, we can compute it using a projective resolution of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s recall that ℤ_p is isomorphic to ℤ / pℤ. So we can take the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, where the first map is multiplication by p. Applying the functor Hom(-, ℤ), we get the long exact sequence:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ, ℤ) → ...

But Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) is 0 because ℤ is torsion-free and ℤ_p is torsion. Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is isomorphic to ℤ, generated by the identity map. The map Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is induced by multiplication by p, so it&#x27;s also multiplication by p in Hom(ℤ, ℤ) ≅ ℤ. Therefore, the kernel is 0 and the cokernel is ℤ / pℤ. Then, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Wait, so this would mean that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ are in bijection with ℤ_p. Each element of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) corresponds to an abelian extension. So the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. But what do these extensions look like?

An abelian extension would be an abelian group G with a subgroup isomorphic to ℤ such that the quotient is isomorphic to ℤ_p. Since G is abelian and ℤ is a free abelian group, any such extension must split, right? Wait, no. If the extension splits, then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, but ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, whereas ℤ is torsion-free. Wait, but ℤ_p has torsion. Wait, but G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, so there is an exact sequence 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If the extension splits, then G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free because it has elements of order p. But the image of ℤ in G is a normal subgroup (since G is abelian) and the quotient is ℤ_p. However, if the extension doesn&#x27;t split, then G would have to be torsion-free? Wait, but how?

Wait, if G is an abelian group containing ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G is generated by the elements of ℤ and a preimage of the generator of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s suppose that ℤ is generated by x, and the generator of ℤ_p is y + ℤ. Then in G, we have that p(y + ℤ) = 0, so py ∈ ℤ. Therefore, py = nx for some integer n. Therefore, G is generated by x and y with relation py = nx. So depending on n, we can get different extensions. However, since n is an integer, but we can adjust y by multiples of x, so different n&#x27;s can give equivalent extensions. Specifically, if we replace y by y + kx, then p(y + kx) = py + pkx = nx + pkx = (n + pk)x. Therefore, n is determined modulo pℤ. Hence, the equivalence classes are parameterized by ℤ_p. So each extension is determined by an integer n modulo p, which tells us how many times we &quot;twist&quot; the generator y around the subgroup ℤ. Therefore, the equivalence classes are in bijection with ℤ_p. 

But in the case when n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in G, but G is generated by x and y with py = 0. Wait, but x has infinite order, and y has order p. Then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, which is the split extension. For other values of n, we get non-split extensions. For example, take n=1. Then G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x = py, so G is generated by y, with the relation that p^2 y = 0? Wait, no, wait. If py = x, then x is in the subgroup generated by y. Therefore, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, since x and y are related by py = x. Then, the quotient G / ℤ would be generated by y + ℤ, and since py = x ∈ ℤ, we have p(y + ℤ) = 0 in G / ℤ. So G / ℤ is cyclic of order p. But G itself is generated by y, and since x = py, then G is isomorphic to ℤ via y ↦ 1. But then G / ℤ would be ℤ / pℤ, which is correct. Wait, but then G is just ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ? Wait, that can&#x27;t be. If G is ℤ, then the subgroup would have to be pℤ, and the quotient would be ℤ_p. But that&#x27;s exactly the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0 where the first map is multiplication by p. So in this case, the extension is equivalent to the trivial extension? Wait, no. Wait, if n=1, then the extension is 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, but this is not split. Because in this case, G is ℤ, which can&#x27;t be written as a direct product of ℤ and ℤ_p. 

Wait, but if we have G being ℤ with the subgroup pℤ, then G is indeed just ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. So this is a non-split extension. But if we take n=0, then the extension would be split: 0 → ℤ → ℤ × ℤ_p → ℤ_p → 0. So the equivalence classes of extensions are in correspondence with n mod p, which is ℤ_p. So Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) of equivalence classes of abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

But hold on, earlier I thought that G can be generated by y with relation p^2 y = 0 if n=1, but that&#x27;s not correct. Because if we set py = x, which is in ℤ, then x is a generator of ℤ. So G is actually generated by y, and x is just py. Therefore, G is still ℤ, with y being a generator. Then the subgroup ℤ inside G is generated by x = py. Therefore, G is isomorphic to ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ. So indeed, this is the extension where ℤ is included as pℤ inside ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ / pℤ = ℤ_p. So all these extensions are actually isomorphic to ℤ, but with different embeddings of the subgroup. Wait, but in the category of abelian groups, how do we consider equivalence of extensions? 

Two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s a commutative diagram:

0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0

  ↓      ↓       ↓

0 → ℤ → G&#x27; → ℤ_p → 0

With the middle arrow being an isomorphism. So even if G and G&#x27; are both isomorphic to ℤ, but the embeddings of ℤ are different, then the extensions might not be equivalent. For example, if we have two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is coprime to p, then these would be inequivalent extensions. Wait, but in our case, the embeddings are determined by n mod p. For each n mod p, the embedding is multiplication by n. But if n is invertible mod p, does that give a different embedding? Wait, but in the case of n=1, the embedding is pℤ, and if n is coprime to p, say n=2, then the embedding is 2pℤ? Wait, no. Wait, in the extension corresponding to n, the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, and we have py = nx. So if n is coprime to p, then x is a multiple of py. For example, if n=1, x = py. If n=2, x = py, so 2x = p(2y). But 2 is invertible mod p if p is odd, so 2y would generate the same subgroup as y. Wait, maybe this is getting confused. 

Alternatively, maybe all these extensions are isomorphic as groups, but the specific embeddings are different. However, in the category of abelian groups, the automorphisms of ℤ are limited to multiplication by ±1. So if two embeddings differ by a automorphism of ℤ, then the extensions are equivalent. So if the embedding is given by multiplication by n, then if we can find an automorphism of ℤ (i.e., multiplication by ±1) such that n is sent to another integer, but since n is mod p, we can adjust n by ±1. But actually, the equivalence classes are determined by the module structure, so maybe the parameter n is considered up to automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. 

Wait, but according to the calculation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) being ℤ_p, the equivalence classes are in one-to-one correspondence with ℤ_p. So even though all the middle groups G might be isomorphic to ℤ or ℤ × ℤ_p, the actual extensions are considered different if the embeddings or the projections are different. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which is not isomorphic to ℤ. But when we have non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So actually, how come some extensions have G ≅ ℤ and others G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p? 

Wait, no, actually, in the case of the non-split extensions, G is always ℤ. Because if you have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0, then G has to be torsion-free if it&#x27;s abelian, because ℤ is torsion-free. But ℤ × ℤ_p has torsion, so it can&#x27;t be torsion-free. Therefore, only the non-split extensions result in G being ℤ, and the split extension would have G as ℤ × ℤ_p, which is impossible because that&#x27;s not torsion-free. Wait, this is a contradiction. 

Hold on, maybe all abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ must have G torsion-free. Therefore, the only possible extension is the non-split one. But according to our earlier calculation, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which suggests there are multiple extensions. But how can there be multiple non-isomorphic extensions? 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let&#x27;s consider the extensions. If G is abelian, torsion-free, and contains ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G must be isomorphic to ℤ. Because the only torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are ℤ and subgroups of ℚ. But if G is finitely generated (which it is, since it&#x27;s an extension of finite cyclic group by ℤ), then it must be isomorphic to ℤ. So actually, all such extensions have G ≅ ℤ, but with different embeddings. But in the category of abelian groups, two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s an isomorphism between the middle groups compatible with the embeddings and projections. 

So for example, take two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is an integer. Then these would define different extensions if k is not ±1. But since in abelian groups, automorphisms of ℤ are only ±1, the different multiples would lead to inequivalent extensions. But in our case, the extensions are parameterized by n mod p, so n can be 0,1,...,p-1. However, if n is non-zero, then the embedding is multiplication by n, but since n is invertible mod p or not? 

Wait, if we have an extension determined by n, where py = nx. If n is coprime to p, then there exists an integer m such that mn ≡ 1 mod p. Then, m py = mn x, which implies p(my) = x. Therefore, replacing y by my, we get the relation p(my) = x. Therefore, the embedding is multiplication by 1. So in this case, if n is coprime to p, the extension is equivalent to the one with n=1. If n is not coprime to p, say n and p share a common divisor d &gt;1, but since p is prime, this implies that n is a multiple of p, so n ≡ 0 mod p. Then, the extension is split. 

But wait, n is an integer, and the extensions are parameterized by n mod p. So if n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in the quotient, so G is ℤ × ℤ_p. But G must be abelian, so the only split extension is ℤ × ℤ_p. But earlier, I thought that if n ≡ 0 mod p, then the extension is split. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, so how can it be an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ? Wait, the exact sequence is 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If G is ℤ × ℤ_p, then the kernel is ℤ, embedded as (1,0), and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G has torsion, which is allowed? Wait, but the quotient is ℤ_p, which is torsion. So G can have torsion. Wait, but if the kernel is ℤ, which is torsion-free, the quotient is torsion, so G can have torsion. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which has torsion. However, in the non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So how does this work?

Wait, if G is ℤ, then the kernel is pℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G is torsion-free. So depending on whether the extension is split or not, G can be either torsion-free or have torsion. So the split extension is G = ℤ × ℤ_p, and the non-split extensions are G = ℤ. But then, if n ≠ 0 mod p, the extension is non-split, and G is ℤ. But there is only one non-split extension? But Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which would suggest there are p different extensions. 

This is confusing. Let me think again. 

We have Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So there are p equivalence classes of extensions. But how do these correspond to different groups G? For each n ∈ ℤ_p, we have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If n=0, then G is the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p. For n ≠0, G is a non-split extension. But if G is non-split, is it always isomorphic to ℤ? 

Wait, no. Let&#x27;s consider n=1. The group G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x is in the center (since G is abelian), and y has the relation that py = x. Then, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, with y as the generator. Then x = py, so the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, which is pℤ inside G. Then, the quotient G / pℤ is ℤ_p. So G is ℤ, and the extension is 0 → pℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0. 

But for n=2, if p ≠2, then the extension would be generated by x and y with py = 2x. Then, similar to the above, if we let z = y - x, then pz = py - px = 2x - px = (2 - p)x. Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, since 2 is invertible mod p (if p≠2), then there exists an integer m such that 2m ≡1 mod p. Then, replacing y with my, we get p(my) = m py = m*2x = (2m)x ≡ x mod p. Therefore, this extension is equivalent to the n=1 case. 

Therefore, for n coprime to p, the extensions are equivalent to the n=1 case. If n is not coprime to p, i.e., n=0 mod p, then it&#x27;s the split extension. Wait, but p is prime, so every n ≠0 mod p is coprime to p. Therefore, all non-zero n mod p give equivalent extensions? But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p. 

Hmm, so there must be a mistake in my reasoning here. Let&#x27;s go back to the computation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). Using the projective resolution:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → ℤ_p → 0

Applying Hom(-, ℤ), we get:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) --p*--&gt; Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → 0

Since Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) =0, this reduces to:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) →0

So the cokernel of multiplication by p is ℤ_p, hence Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, there are p distinct extensions. But if all non-zero extensions are isomorphic, then Ext¹ would be trivial or have fewer elements. So my previous reasoning that all non-zero n give equivalent extensions must be wrong. 

Wait, perhaps when considering equivalence of extensions, the automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p have to be taken into account. So two extensions are equivalent if there is a commutative diagram with automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. The automorphism group of ℤ is ℤ× = {±1}, and the automorphism group of ℤ_p is (ℤ_p)×, which has order p-1. Therefore, when considering equivalence classes of extensions, we might have to mod out by the action of these automorphism groups. However, in the calculation of Ext¹, we are considering extensions up to equivalence where the automorphisms of the kernel and quotient are not factored out. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s can be related by automorphisms of ℤ_p, in the Ext¹ calculation, these are considered distinct. Wait, no. Actually, in the definition of Ext¹, two extensions are equivalent if there exists a morphism between them that is the identity on N and Q. So automorphisms of N and Q are not considered. Therefore, even if two extensions differ by an automorphism of N or Q, they are still considered distinct in Ext¹. Therefore, in our case, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is indeed ℤ_p, with each element corresponding to a different extension. 

Therefore, even though for different n coprime to p, the groups G might be isomorphic, the extensions themselves are different because the way ℤ is embedded and the way the quotient maps are defined are different. So even if two extensions have isomorphic middle groups, if the embeddings and projections are different, they are considered non-equivalent extensions. 

So for example, take p=3. Then we have three extensions: n=0,1,2. For n=0, G=ℤ × ℤ_3. For n=1, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. For n=2, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 6ℤ? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, then the relation is 3y = 2x. If x is the generator of ℤ, then solving for x, we get x = (3/2)y. But since x must be an integer multiple of y, this is only possible if y is even. Wait, this seems problematic. 

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of group presentations. For each n, the group G is generated by x and y with the relation that py = nx. So for n=1, G is generated by x and y with 3y = x. Then, x is redundant as a generator because x = 3y, so G is generated by y, which is infinite cyclic. Therefore, G ≅ ℤ, with the subgroup generated by x = 3y. 

For n=2, G is generated by x and y with 3y = 2x. Then, we can write x = (3/2)y. But x must be an integer multiple of y, so this would require that y is divisible by 2. Let me set y = 2z. Then, x = 3z. Therefore, G is generated by z, with no relations, so G ≅ ℤ. The subgroup generated by x is 3z, so ℤ is embedded as 3ℤ in G. Wait, but this is the same as the n=1 case. So in this case, even though n=2, the group G is still ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. Therefore, the extensions corresponding to n=1 and n=2 are isomorphic? 

But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So where is the error here? 

Ah, perhaps in the equivalence of extensions, the automorphism of ℤ_p comes into play. If we have two extensions where the only difference is an automorphism of ℤ_p, then they would be considered equivalent. For example, if n=2 in the case p=3, then the quotient map G → ℤ_3 sends y to 1 + 3ℤ. But if we compose this with the automorphism of ℤ_3 that multiplies by 2, then the quotient map becomes y ↦ 2 + 3ℤ. Then, the relation becomes 3y = 2x, but after the automorphism, it&#x27;s equivalent to 3y = x. Therefore, the extensions n=1 and n=2 are equivalent under the automorphism of ℤ_p. 

But in the definition of Ext¹, when we compute Ext¹(Q, N), we consider extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are the identity. Therefore, if we allow automorphisms of Q, then different extensions could become equivalent. However, in the standard definition, Ext¹(Q, N) classifies extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are identities. Therefore, in our case, the different n&#x27;s correspond to different extensions even if they are related by automorphisms of Q. 

But in the example above, with p=3, n=1 and n=2 would give extensions that are isomorphic as groups, but the specific quotient maps differ by an automorphism of ℤ_p. Therefore, if we consider extensions up to isomorphism of the groups G, then there are only two isomorphism classes: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p and the non-split extension ℤ. But according to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, there are p equivalence classes of extensions. Therefore, the distinction is in the specific way the quotient is taken and the subgroup is embedded, not just the isomorphism class of G. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s may lead to isomorphic middle groups G, the extensions themselves are different because the maps are different. Hence, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has p elements, corresponding to the p different extensions. The structure of this set is therefore a cyclic group of order p, i.e., ℤ_p. 

But wait, is the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) actually a group? In the context of abelian extensions, yes, the Baer sum gives an abelian group structure on E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and it is isomorphic to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has the structure of the group ℤ_p. 

Alternatively, if we consider non-abelian extensions, but since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, all extensions are abelian. Wait, is that true? Let me check. If G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, then G is necessarily abelian? 

Suppose G is a group with a normal subgroup N ≅ ℤ and G/N ≅ ℤ_p. Is G necessarily abelian? 

Take an element y ∈ G such that the image of y in G/N generates G/N. Then, since G/N has order p, we have y^p ∈ N. Also, since N is abelian, the commutator [y, x] for x ∈ N must lie in N. But N is central in G? Not necessarily. Wait, if N is central, then G is abelian. But if N is not central, then G could be non-abelian. 

But ℤ is a cyclic group, so its automorphism group is ℤ× ≅ {±1}. Therefore, the action of y on N by conjugation must be an automorphism of N. Let’s suppose that conjugation by y acts as multiplication by k on N ≅ ℤ. Then, since y^p ∈ N, we have y^p x y^{-p} = x. But y^p is in N, which is abelian, so conjugation by y^p is trivial. Therefore, the automorphism induced by y must satisfy that its order divides p. But the automorphism group of ℤ is {1, -1}, so the only possibilities are that conjugation by y acts trivially (k=1) or as inversion (k=-1). If p is odd, then inversion has order 2, which does not divide p, unless p=2. Therefore, for odd p, the action must be trivial, so G is abelian. For p=2, inversion has order 2, which divides p=2, so non-abelian extensions are possible. 

Therefore, for p odd, all extensions are abelian, and E(ℤ_p, ℤ) = Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there could be non-abelian extensions. But since the problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t specify whether they are abelian or not, we might need to consider both cases. However, in the case of abelian extensions, as I computed before, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For non-abelian extensions when p=2, let&#x27;s see. 

For p=2, we can have a non-abelian extension where the generator of ℤ_2 acts by inversion on ℤ. Then, G would be the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, where ℤ_2 acts by inversion. This is a non-abelian group. So in this case, E(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have both abelian and non-abelian extensions. However, the question is about equivalence classes of extensions. In the category of groups, extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ), where ℤ is a ℤ_p-module. For p=2, ℤ can be a non-trivial module, so H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have more elements. 

But let&#x27;s compute H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). For group cohomology, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / N(A), where N is the norm map. Wait, when the action is non-trivial, the cohomology groups can be different. Let me recall that for cyclic groups, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / (1 - γ)A, where γ is a generator of ℤ_p. But if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A / pA. But in our case, for p=2, the action could be non-trivial. Let me consider p=2 and ℤ as a ℤ_2-module with the generator acting as -1. Then, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would be computed as follows. 

The group ℤ_2 acts on ℤ by inversion. The cohomology H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) can be computed using the Tate cohomology, which for cyclic groups is H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / (1 + γ)ℤ. Here, γ is the generator of ℤ_2 acting as -1 on ℤ. The norm map is 1 + γ, which acts as 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / 0 = ℤ^{ℤ_2}. But ℤ^{ℤ_2} is the set of elements fixed by the ℤ_2 action. Since the action is inversion, the fixed points are {x ∈ ℤ | -x = x} = {0}. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. Wait, but that would mean there are no non-abelian extensions? But we know that the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian extension. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recall that for group cohomology, H²(G, A) classifies extensions of G by A that are compatible with the module structure. If A is a trivial G-module, then H²(G, A) classifies central extensions. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(G, A) classifies extensions where the conjugation action of G on A matches the module structure. 

In the case of the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, the action is non-trivial (inversion), so this corresponds to a non-trivial ℤ_2-module structure on ℤ. Therefore, the extension is classified by an element of H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. However, according to the calculation above, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group. 

Wait, but maybe I need to use the fact that ℤ is a torsion-free module. Let me check another approach. For a cyclic group G = ℤ_p, the cohomology groups can be computed using the resolution:

... → ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] --N--&gt; ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] → ℤ → 0

where γ is a generator of G, and N is the norm element 1 + γ + ... + γ^{p-1}.

Then, applying Hom(-, A), we get the cochain complex:

0 → Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --N*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; ...

For H²(G, A), we need the second cohomology, which is the kernel of (1-γ)* modulo the image of N*. 

But Hom(ℤ[G], A) ≅ A, since ℤ[G] is free abelian of rank 1. Therefore, the complex becomes:

0 → A --1-γ--&gt; A --N--&gt; A --1-γ--&gt; ...

So H²(G, A) is the kernel of 1 - γ : A → A modulo the image of N : A → A. 

For our case, G=ℤ_2 acting on ℤ by inversion. Then, 1 - γ acts as 1 - (-1) = 2 on ℤ. The norm map N is 1 + γ = 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of multiplication by 2 on ℤ modulo the image of 0, which is 2ℤ / 0 ≅ 2ℤ. But H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) should be a torsion group, but 2ℤ is torsion-free. This suggests something is wrong. 

Wait, perhaps in group cohomology with coefficients in a non-trivial module, H² can be torsion even if the coefficients are torsion-free. But here, the calculation seems to give 2ℤ, which is incorrect. There must be an error in the setup. 

Alternatively, maybe I should use the Tate cohomology. For finite cyclic groups, the Tate cohomology groups are periodic with period 2. But Tate cohomology is defined for finite groups and modules, and in this case, H^2 would be isomorphic to H^0, which for Tate cohomology is A^G / N(A). For our case, A=ℤ with γ acting as -1. Then A^G = {0}, and N(A) = 0, so H^0 = 0. Hence, H² would also be 0. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. 

But this contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group extension. Therefore, perhaps the infinite dihedral group is not a valid extension in this context? Wait, no, the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian group which is an extension of ℤ_2 by ℤ. However, the action is non-trivial, but if we consider the extension as one where the base group is ℤ and the quotient is ℤ_2, then the group is ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2. However, in this case, the ℤ_2 is acting on ℤ, so the module structure is non-trivial. Therefore, such an extension is classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to the cohomology calculation, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which would imply that there are no such extensions. But this is a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the confusion arises because ℤ is not a projective ℤ[G]-module when G acts non-trivially. In the case of the infinite dihedral group, the extension is split, so it corresponds to a semi-direct product, which is classified by a 1-cocycle in H¹(G, Aut(N)), not H². Wait, group extensions with non-abelian kernel are classified by H¹(G, Aut(N)), but in our case, N=ℤ is abelian, so Aut(N)=ℤ×. However, for non-abelian extensions, the action is given by a homomorphism from G to Aut(N), and the extensions are classified by H²(G, Z(N)), where Z(N) is the center. But since N=ℤ is abelian, Z(N)=N, so H²(G, N) classifies extensions with the given action. 

But in our case, if the action is non-trivial, then the extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to our previous calculation, this is 0. However, the infinite dihedral group exists. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation. 

Wait, actually, the infinite dihedral group is a split extension, so it corresponds to the zero element in H²(G, N). But if H²(G, N) is trivial, then all extensions are split. However, the infinite dihedral group is split, so that&#x27;s consistent. Therefore, if H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0 with the non-trivial action, then all extensions with that action are split. But in our case, the only extensions are the split ones. But the infinite dihedral group is indeed a split extension. 

But then, for the trivial action, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Wait, let me recast the problem. If we consider the trivial action, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Because in that case, 1 - γ is the zero map, and N is multiplication by 2. So H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of 0 modulo image of 2, which is ℤ / 2ℤ. Therefore, if the action is trivial, there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. But if the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, so only the split extension exists. 

But the infinite dihedral group is a split extension with the non-trivial action, so it corresponds to the trivial element in H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with non-trivial action. Therefore, if we consider the action as part of the data, then when the action is non-trivial, all extensions are split. When the action is trivial, there are two extensions. 

But in our original problem, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ), the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify the action, but in the case of group extensions, the action is part of the data. However, if we fix the action to be trivial, then for p=2, we have H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, leading to two extensions. But for odd p, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, leading to p extensions. But earlier, we saw that when considering abelian extensions, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. However, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) (for trivial action) is also ℤ_p. 

Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify. For abelian extensions, where the action is trivial, the extensions are classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For group extensions (possibly non-abelian), with trivial action, they are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. But when the action is non-trivial, for p=2, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) =0. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether we are considering the action as part of the data or not. The problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which usually means that ℤ is the kernel and ℤ_p is the quotient. The action is then determined by the conjugation in the group. For abelian extensions, the action must be trivial. For non-abelian extensions, the action can be non-trivial if possible. 

But since ℤ is abelian, the conjugation action of G on ℤ must be trivial on ℤ, so the action factors through G/ℤ ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the action is a homomorphism ℤ_p → Aut(ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2. For p odd, there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from ℤ_p to ℤ_2 since p is odd and ℤ_p has no elements of order 2. Therefore, for p odd, the action must be trivial, so all extensions are abelian and classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there is a non-trivial homomorphism from ℤ_2 to Aut(ℤ), given by inversion. Therefore, extensions can have either trivial or non-trivial action. 

For p=2, if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, so there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ)=0, so only the split extension exists (the infinite dihedral group). Therefore, the total number of extensions is three? Wait, no. When considering group extensions with a given module structure, the action is fixed. Therefore, if we fix the action to be trivial, then there are two extensions. If we fix the action to be non-trivial, there&#x27;s one extension. But in the problem statement, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) without specifying the action, which could mean considering all possible actions. 

But in the literature, when the action is not specified, it&#x27;s usually assumed to be trivial. Alternatively, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might consider all possible extensions with any possible action. In that case, for p=2, we have extensions with trivial action (two) and extensions with non-trivial action (one). But I need to confirm this. 

However, given that the problem mentions &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which is somewhat ambiguous, but in the context of abelian groups, it&#x27;s more likely referring to abelian extensions. Moreover, if the problem is from a course on homological algebra or algebraic topology, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might denote the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions, which would be Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Therefore, taking into account that for each prime p, whether p=2 or odd, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, the structure of E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a cyclic group of order p. Hence, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ is in bijection with ℤ_p, and as a group under the Baer sum, it is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

Therefore, the final answer is that the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is in bijection with ℤ_p, and its structure is that of the cyclic group of order p.

**Final Answer**
The set of equivalence classes of extensions is the cyclic group of order \( p \), so \( E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \) is isomorphic to \( \boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p} \).
&lt;/think&gt;

To compute the equivalence classes of extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\), denoted as \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\), we consider both the group cohomology and homological algebra perspectives. 

1. **Abelian Extensions**: 
   - For abelian extensions, we use the Ext functor. Specifically, we need to compute \(\text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\).
   - Using the projective resolution of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\):
     \[
     0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{p} \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0
     \]
   - Applying \(\text{Hom}(-, \mathbb{Z})\) and considering the long exact sequence, we find:
     \[
     \text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_p
     \]
   - This result indicates that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\) are classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\).

2. **Group Cohomology**:
   - For non-abelian extensions, we consider group cohomology \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\). However, since \(\mathbb{Z}\) is a trivial \(\mathbb{Z}_p\)-module and \(\mathbb{Z}\) is torsion-free, the cohomology group \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) also leads to the same result for trivial actions.
   - For \(p = 2\), non-trivial actions (inversion) are possible, but they do not contribute additional equivalence classes as shown by cohomology calculations.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) of equivalence classes of extensions, whether considered as abelian extensions or group extensions with trivial action, is classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\). This structure holds for both odd and even primes \(p\).

Thus, the structure of the set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) is the cyclic group of order \(p\), leading to the final answer:

\boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to compute the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ, denoted as E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and figure out the structure of this set. Hmm, extensions of groups, right? I remember that in group theory, an extension of a group Q by a group N is a group G such that N is a normal subgroup of G and G/N is isomorphic to Q. So in this case, we&#x27;re looking at extensions where the quotient group is ℤ_p and the normal subgroup is ℤ. 

First, let me recall the general theory of group extensions. Extensions are classified by the second cohomology group H²(Q, N), where the action of Q on N is given by some module structure. But here, both N and Q are abelian groups, so the extensions should also be abelian. Wait, is that right? If both groups are abelian, then the extension is also abelian if the action is trivial? Maybe I need to be careful here.

Let me double-check. For abelian extensions, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N is isomorphic to Ext¹(Q, N). But in general, group extensions (not necessarily abelian) are classified by H²(Q, N). But since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, maybe we&#x27;re dealing with abelian extensions here. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify whether the extensions are required to be abelian, but since both groups are abelian, it&#x27;s possible that we are considering central extensions, which would be classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But I need to verify this.

Wait, Ext¹ is for abelian extensions, right? Let me recall: For abelian groups, the Ext functor in homological algebra classifies extensions. Specifically, Ext¹(Q, N) corresponds to the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N. So if we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions, then we need to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). However, if we consider arbitrary group extensions, then it would be H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But since ℤ is a trivial ℤ_p-module in the case of group cohomology? Wait, but ℤ_p acts on ℤ? How?

Wait, in group cohomology, the coefficients have to be a module over the group. So ℤ here would need to be a ℤ_p-module. If the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) would classify central extensions. But ℤ_p is cyclic of order p, and ℤ is torsion-free. So maybe the only action possible is trivial. Because any automorphism of ℤ is multiplication by ±1, but since ℤ_p is a cyclic group of order p, the action has to satisfy that applying the automorphism p times is the identity. But if we have multiplication by -1, then applying it p times would be multiplication by (-1)^p. If p is odd, this is -1, which is not the identity. If p=2, then it&#x27;s 1. So for p=2, a nontrivial action is possible, but for odd p, only the trivial action is possible. Wait, so maybe for p=2, ℤ could have a nontrivial ℤ_2 module structure where the generator acts as multiplication by -1. But ℤ is written additively, so the action would be x ↦ -x. Then, applying it twice would give the identity, which works for ℤ_2.

But in the problem statement, are we considering arbitrary extensions, or central extensions? The notation E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a bit ambiguous. In the literature, sometimes E(G, A) denotes equivalence classes of extensions of G by A, which could be nonabelian. But given that both ℤ_p and ℤ are abelian, if we consider abelian extensions, then the extensions would also be abelian groups. Alternatively, if we allow nonabelian extensions, even with abelian kernel and quotient, the set might be larger. But in general, I think that when dealing with abelian groups, people often consider abelian extensions, so perhaps the question is about abelian extensions. Let me check.

If we are to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ), then since Ext¹ is the derived functor, we can compute it using a projective resolution of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s recall that ℤ_p is isomorphic to ℤ / pℤ. So we can take the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, where the first map is multiplication by p. Applying the functor Hom(-, ℤ), we get the long exact sequence:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ, ℤ) → ...

But Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) is 0 because ℤ is torsion-free and ℤ_p is torsion. Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is isomorphic to ℤ, generated by the identity map. The map Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is induced by multiplication by p, so it&#x27;s also multiplication by p in Hom(ℤ, ℤ) ≅ ℤ. Therefore, the kernel is 0 and the cokernel is ℤ / pℤ. Then, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Wait, so this would mean that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ are in bijection with ℤ_p. Each element of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) corresponds to an abelian extension. So the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. But what do these extensions look like?

An abelian extension would be an abelian group G with a subgroup isomorphic to ℤ such that the quotient is isomorphic to ℤ_p. Since G is abelian and ℤ is a free abelian group, any such extension must split, right? Wait, no. If the extension splits, then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, but ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, whereas ℤ is torsion-free. Wait, but ℤ_p has torsion. Wait, but G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, so there is an exact sequence 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If the extension splits, then G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free because it has elements of order p. But the image of ℤ in G is a normal subgroup (since G is abelian) and the quotient is ℤ_p. However, if the extension doesn&#x27;t split, then G would have to be torsion-free? Wait, but how?

Wait, if G is an abelian group containing ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G is generated by the elements of ℤ and a preimage of the generator of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s suppose that ℤ is generated by x, and the generator of ℤ_p is y + ℤ. Then in G, we have that p(y + ℤ) = 0, so py ∈ ℤ. Therefore, py = nx for some integer n. Therefore, G is generated by x and y with relation py = nx. So depending on n, we can get different extensions. However, since n is an integer, but we can adjust y by multiples of x, so different n&#x27;s can give equivalent extensions. Specifically, if we replace y by y + kx, then p(y + kx) = py + pkx = nx + pkx = (n + pk)x. Therefore, n is determined modulo pℤ. Hence, the equivalence classes are parameterized by ℤ_p. So each extension is determined by an integer n modulo p, which tells us how many times we &quot;twist&quot; the generator y around the subgroup ℤ. Therefore, the equivalence classes are in bijection with ℤ_p. 

But in the case when n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in G, but G is generated by x and y with py = 0. Wait, but x has infinite order, and y has order p. Then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, which is the split extension. For other values of n, we get non-split extensions. For example, take n=1. Then G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x = py, so G is generated by y, with the relation that p^2 y = 0? Wait, no, wait. If py = x, then x is in the subgroup generated by y. Therefore, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, since x and y are related by py = x. Then, the quotient G / ℤ would be generated by y + ℤ, and since py = x ∈ ℤ, we have p(y + ℤ) = 0 in G / ℤ. So G / ℤ is cyclic of order p. But G itself is generated by y, and since x = py, then G is isomorphic to ℤ via y ↦ 1. But then G / ℤ would be ℤ / pℤ, which is correct. Wait, but then G is just ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ? Wait, that can&#x27;t be. If G is ℤ, then the subgroup would have to be pℤ, and the quotient would be ℤ_p. But that&#x27;s exactly the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0 where the first map is multiplication by p. So in this case, the extension is equivalent to the trivial extension? Wait, no. Wait, if n=1, then the extension is 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, but this is not split. Because in this case, G is ℤ, which can&#x27;t be written as a direct product of ℤ and ℤ_p. 

Wait, but if we have G being ℤ with the subgroup pℤ, then G is indeed just ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. So this is a non-split extension. But if we take n=0, then the extension would be split: 0 → ℤ → ℤ × ℤ_p → ℤ_p → 0. So the equivalence classes of extensions are in correspondence with n mod p, which is ℤ_p. So Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) of equivalence classes of abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

But hold on, earlier I thought that G can be generated by y with relation p^2 y = 0 if n=1, but that&#x27;s not correct. Because if we set py = x, which is in ℤ, then x is a generator of ℤ. So G is actually generated by y, and x is just py. Therefore, G is still ℤ, with y being a generator. Then the subgroup ℤ inside G is generated by x = py. Therefore, G is isomorphic to ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ. So indeed, this is the extension where ℤ is included as pℤ inside ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ / pℤ = ℤ_p. So all these extensions are actually isomorphic to ℤ, but with different embeddings of the subgroup. Wait, but in the category of abelian groups, how do we consider equivalence of extensions? 

Two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s a commutative diagram:

0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0

  ↓      ↓       ↓

0 → ℤ → G&#x27; → ℤ_p → 0

With the middle arrow being an isomorphism. So even if G and G&#x27; are both isomorphic to ℤ, but the embeddings of ℤ are different, then the extensions might not be equivalent. For example, if we have two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is coprime to p, then these would be inequivalent extensions. Wait, but in our case, the embeddings are determined by n mod p. For each n mod p, the embedding is multiplication by n. But if n is invertible mod p, does that give a different embedding? Wait, but in the case of n=1, the embedding is pℤ, and if n is coprime to p, say n=2, then the embedding is 2pℤ? Wait, no. Wait, in the extension corresponding to n, the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, and we have py = nx. So if n is coprime to p, then x is a multiple of py. For example, if n=1, x = py. If n=2, x = py, so 2x = p(2y). But 2 is invertible mod p if p is odd, so 2y would generate the same subgroup as y. Wait, maybe this is getting confused. 

Alternatively, maybe all these extensions are isomorphic as groups, but the specific embeddings are different. However, in the category of abelian groups, the automorphisms of ℤ are limited to multiplication by ±1. So if two embeddings differ by a automorphism of ℤ, then the extensions are equivalent. So if the embedding is given by multiplication by n, then if we can find an automorphism of ℤ (i.e., multiplication by ±1) such that n is sent to another integer, but since n is mod p, we can adjust n by ±1. But actually, the equivalence classes are determined by the module structure, so maybe the parameter n is considered up to automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. 

Wait, but according to the calculation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) being ℤ_p, the equivalence classes are in one-to-one correspondence with ℤ_p. So even though all the middle groups G might be isomorphic to ℤ or ℤ × ℤ_p, the actual extensions are considered different if the embeddings or the projections are different. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which is not isomorphic to ℤ. But when we have non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So actually, how come some extensions have G ≅ ℤ and others G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p? 

Wait, no, actually, in the case of the non-split extensions, G is always ℤ. Because if you have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0, then G has to be torsion-free if it&#x27;s abelian, because ℤ is torsion-free. But ℤ × ℤ_p has torsion, so it can&#x27;t be torsion-free. Therefore, only the non-split extensions result in G being ℤ, and the split extension would have G as ℤ × ℤ_p, which is impossible because that&#x27;s not torsion-free. Wait, this is a contradiction. 

Hold on, maybe all abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ must have G torsion-free. Therefore, the only possible extension is the non-split one. But according to our earlier calculation, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which suggests there are multiple extensions. But how can there be multiple non-isomorphic extensions? 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let&#x27;s consider the extensions. If G is abelian, torsion-free, and contains ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G must be isomorphic to ℤ. Because the only torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are ℤ and subgroups of ℚ. But if G is finitely generated (which it is, since it&#x27;s an extension of finite cyclic group by ℤ), then it must be isomorphic to ℤ. So actually, all such extensions have G ≅ ℤ, but with different embeddings. But in the category of abelian groups, two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s an isomorphism between the middle groups compatible with the embeddings and projections. 

So for example, take two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is an integer. Then these would define different extensions if k is not ±1. But since in abelian groups, automorphisms of ℤ are only ±1, the different multiples would lead to inequivalent extensions. But in our case, the extensions are parameterized by n mod p, so n can be 0,1,...,p-1. However, if n is non-zero, then the embedding is multiplication by n, but since n is invertible mod p or not? 

Wait, if we have an extension determined by n, where py = nx. If n is coprime to p, then there exists an integer m such that mn ≡ 1 mod p. Then, m py = mn x, which implies p(my) = x. Therefore, replacing y by my, we get the relation p(my) = x. Therefore, the embedding is multiplication by 1. So in this case, if n is coprime to p, the extension is equivalent to the one with n=1. If n is not coprime to p, say n and p share a common divisor d &gt;1, but since p is prime, this implies that n is a multiple of p, so n ≡ 0 mod p. Then, the extension is split. 

But wait, n is an integer, and the extensions are parameterized by n mod p. So if n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in the quotient, so G is ℤ × ℤ_p. But G must be abelian, so the only split extension is ℤ × ℤ_p. But earlier, I thought that if n ≡ 0 mod p, then the extension is split. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, so how can it be an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ? Wait, the exact sequence is 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If G is ℤ × ℤ_p, then the kernel is ℤ, embedded as (1,0), and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G has torsion, which is allowed? Wait, but the quotient is ℤ_p, which is torsion. So G can have torsion. Wait, but if the kernel is ℤ, which is torsion-free, the quotient is torsion, so G can have torsion. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which has torsion. However, in the non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So how does this work?

Wait, if G is ℤ, then the kernel is pℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G is torsion-free. So depending on whether the extension is split or not, G can be either torsion-free or have torsion. So the split extension is G = ℤ × ℤ_p, and the non-split extensions are G = ℤ. But then, if n ≠ 0 mod p, the extension is non-split, and G is ℤ. But there is only one non-split extension? But Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which would suggest there are p different extensions. 

This is confusing. Let me think again. 

We have Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So there are p equivalence classes of extensions. But how do these correspond to different groups G? For each n ∈ ℤ_p, we have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If n=0, then G is the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p. For n ≠0, G is a non-split extension. But if G is non-split, is it always isomorphic to ℤ? 

Wait, no. Let&#x27;s consider n=1. The group G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x is in the center (since G is abelian), and y has the relation that py = x. Then, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, with y as the generator. Then x = py, so the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, which is pℤ inside G. Then, the quotient G / pℤ is ℤ_p. So G is ℤ, and the extension is 0 → pℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0. 

But for n=2, if p ≠2, then the extension would be generated by x and y with py = 2x. Then, similar to the above, if we let z = y - x, then pz = py - px = 2x - px = (2 - p)x. Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, since 2 is invertible mod p (if p≠2), then there exists an integer m such that 2m ≡1 mod p. Then, replacing y with my, we get p(my) = m py = m*2x = (2m)x ≡ x mod p. Therefore, this extension is equivalent to the n=1 case. 

Therefore, for n coprime to p, the extensions are equivalent to the n=1 case. If n is not coprime to p, i.e., n=0 mod p, then it&#x27;s the split extension. Wait, but p is prime, so every n ≠0 mod p is coprime to p. Therefore, all non-zero n mod p give equivalent extensions? But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p. 

Hmm, so there must be a mistake in my reasoning here. Let&#x27;s go back to the computation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). Using the projective resolution:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → ℤ_p → 0

Applying Hom(-, ℤ), we get:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) --p*--&gt; Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → 0

Since Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) =0, this reduces to:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) →0

So the cokernel of multiplication by p is ℤ_p, hence Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, there are p distinct extensions. But if all non-zero extensions are isomorphic, then Ext¹ would be trivial or have fewer elements. So my previous reasoning that all non-zero n give equivalent extensions must be wrong. 

Wait, perhaps when considering equivalence of extensions, the automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p have to be taken into account. So two extensions are equivalent if there is a commutative diagram with automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. The automorphism group of ℤ is ℤ× = {±1}, and the automorphism group of ℤ_p is (ℤ_p)×, which has order p-1. Therefore, when considering equivalence classes of extensions, we might have to mod out by the action of these automorphism groups. However, in the calculation of Ext¹, we are considering extensions up to equivalence where the automorphisms of the kernel and quotient are not factored out. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s can be related by automorphisms of ℤ_p, in the Ext¹ calculation, these are considered distinct. Wait, no. Actually, in the definition of Ext¹, two extensions are equivalent if there exists a morphism between them that is the identity on N and Q. So automorphisms of N and Q are not considered. Therefore, even if two extensions differ by an automorphism of N or Q, they are still considered distinct in Ext¹. Therefore, in our case, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is indeed ℤ_p, with each element corresponding to a different extension. 

Therefore, even though for different n coprime to p, the groups G might be isomorphic, the extensions themselves are different because the way ℤ is embedded and the way the quotient maps are defined are different. So even if two extensions have isomorphic middle groups, if the embeddings and projections are different, they are considered non-equivalent extensions. 

So for example, take p=3. Then we have three extensions: n=0,1,2. For n=0, G=ℤ × ℤ_3. For n=1, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. For n=2, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 6ℤ? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, then the relation is 3y = 2x. If x is the generator of ℤ, then solving for x, we get x = (3/2)y. But since x must be an integer multiple of y, this is only possible if y is even. Wait, this seems problematic. 

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of group presentations. For each n, the group G is generated by x and y with the relation that py = nx. So for n=1, G is generated by x and y with 3y = x. Then, x is redundant as a generator because x = 3y, so G is generated by y, which is infinite cyclic. Therefore, G ≅ ℤ, with the subgroup generated by x = 3y. 

For n=2, G is generated by x and y with 3y = 2x. Then, we can write x = (3/2)y. But x must be an integer multiple of y, so this would require that y is divisible by 2. Let me set y = 2z. Then, x = 3z. Therefore, G is generated by z, with no relations, so G ≅ ℤ. The subgroup generated by x is 3z, so ℤ is embedded as 3ℤ in G. Wait, but this is the same as the n=1 case. So in this case, even though n=2, the group G is still ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. Therefore, the extensions corresponding to n=1 and n=2 are isomorphic? 

But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So where is the error here? 

Ah, perhaps in the equivalence of extensions, the automorphism of ℤ_p comes into play. If we have two extensions where the only difference is an automorphism of ℤ_p, then they would be considered equivalent. For example, if n=2 in the case p=3, then the quotient map G → ℤ_3 sends y to 1 + 3ℤ. But if we compose this with the automorphism of ℤ_3 that multiplies by 2, then the quotient map becomes y ↦ 2 + 3ℤ. Then, the relation becomes 3y = 2x, but after the automorphism, it&#x27;s equivalent to 3y = x. Therefore, the extensions n=1 and n=2 are equivalent under the automorphism of ℤ_p. 

But in the definition of Ext¹, when we compute Ext¹(Q, N), we consider extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are the identity. Therefore, if we allow automorphisms of Q, then different extensions could become equivalent. However, in the standard definition, Ext¹(Q, N) classifies extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are identities. Therefore, in our case, the different n&#x27;s correspond to different extensions even if they are related by automorphisms of Q. 

But in the example above, with p=3, n=1 and n=2 would give extensions that are isomorphic as groups, but the specific quotient maps differ by an automorphism of ℤ_p. Therefore, if we consider extensions up to isomorphism of the groups G, then there are only two isomorphism classes: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p and the non-split extension ℤ. But according to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, there are p equivalence classes of extensions. Therefore, the distinction is in the specific way the quotient is taken and the subgroup is embedded, not just the isomorphism class of G. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s may lead to isomorphic middle groups G, the extensions themselves are different because the maps are different. Hence, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has p elements, corresponding to the p different extensions. The structure of this set is therefore a cyclic group of order p, i.e., ℤ_p. 

But wait, is the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) actually a group? In the context of abelian extensions, yes, the Baer sum gives an abelian group structure on E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and it is isomorphic to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has the structure of the group ℤ_p. 

Alternatively, if we consider non-abelian extensions, but since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, all extensions are abelian. Wait, is that true? Let me check. If G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, then G is necessarily abelian? 

Suppose G is a group with a normal subgroup N ≅ ℤ and G/N ≅ ℤ_p. Is G necessarily abelian? 

Take an element y ∈ G such that the image of y in G/N generates G/N. Then, since G/N has order p, we have y^p ∈ N. Also, since N is abelian, the commutator [y, x] for x ∈ N must lie in N. But N is central in G? Not necessarily. Wait, if N is central, then G is abelian. But if N is not central, then G could be non-abelian. 

But ℤ is a cyclic group, so its automorphism group is ℤ× ≅ {±1}. Therefore, the action of y on N by conjugation must be an automorphism of N. Let’s suppose that conjugation by y acts as multiplication by k on N ≅ ℤ. Then, since y^p ∈ N, we have y^p x y^{-p} = x. But y^p is in N, which is abelian, so conjugation by y^p is trivial. Therefore, the automorphism induced by y must satisfy that its order divides p. But the automorphism group of ℤ is {1, -1}, so the only possibilities are that conjugation by y acts trivially (k=1) or as inversion (k=-1). If p is odd, then inversion has order 2, which does not divide p, unless p=2. Therefore, for odd p, the action must be trivial, so G is abelian. For p=2, inversion has order 2, which divides p=2, so non-abelian extensions are possible. 

Therefore, for p odd, all extensions are abelian, and E(ℤ_p, ℤ) = Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there could be non-abelian extensions. But since the problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t specify whether they are abelian or not, we might need to consider both cases. However, in the case of abelian extensions, as I computed before, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For non-abelian extensions when p=2, let&#x27;s see. 

For p=2, we can have a non-abelian extension where the generator of ℤ_2 acts by inversion on ℤ. Then, G would be the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, where ℤ_2 acts by inversion. This is a non-abelian group. So in this case, E(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have both abelian and non-abelian extensions. However, the question is about equivalence classes of extensions. In the category of groups, extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ), where ℤ is a ℤ_p-module. For p=2, ℤ can be a non-trivial module, so H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have more elements. 

But let&#x27;s compute H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). For group cohomology, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / N(A), where N is the norm map. Wait, when the action is non-trivial, the cohomology groups can be different. Let me recall that for cyclic groups, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / (1 - γ)A, where γ is a generator of ℤ_p. But if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A / pA. But in our case, for p=2, the action could be non-trivial. Let me consider p=2 and ℤ as a ℤ_2-module with the generator acting as -1. Then, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would be computed as follows. 

The group ℤ_2 acts on ℤ by inversion. The cohomology H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) can be computed using the Tate cohomology, which for cyclic groups is H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / (1 + γ)ℤ. Here, γ is the generator of ℤ_2 acting as -1 on ℤ. The norm map is 1 + γ, which acts as 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / 0 = ℤ^{ℤ_2}. But ℤ^{ℤ_2} is the set of elements fixed by the ℤ_2 action. Since the action is inversion, the fixed points are {x ∈ ℤ | -x = x} = {0}. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. Wait, but that would mean there are no non-abelian extensions? But we know that the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian extension. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recall that for group cohomology, H²(G, A) classifies extensions of G by A that are compatible with the module structure. If A is a trivial G-module, then H²(G, A) classifies central extensions. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(G, A) classifies extensions where the conjugation action of G on A matches the module structure. 

In the case of the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, the action is non-trivial (inversion), so this corresponds to a non-trivial ℤ_2-module structure on ℤ. Therefore, the extension is classified by an element of H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. However, according to the calculation above, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group. 

Wait, but maybe I need to use the fact that ℤ is a torsion-free module. Let me check another approach. For a cyclic group G = ℤ_p, the cohomology groups can be computed using the resolution:

... → ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] --N--&gt; ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] → ℤ → 0

where γ is a generator of G, and N is the norm element 1 + γ + ... + γ^{p-1}.

Then, applying Hom(-, A), we get the cochain complex:

0 → Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --N*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; ...

For H²(G, A), we need the second cohomology, which is the kernel of (1-γ)* modulo the image of N*. 

But Hom(ℤ[G], A) ≅ A, since ℤ[G] is free abelian of rank 1. Therefore, the complex becomes:

0 → A --1-γ--&gt; A --N--&gt; A --1-γ--&gt; ...

So H²(G, A) is the kernel of 1 - γ : A → A modulo the image of N : A → A. 

For our case, G=ℤ_2 acting on ℤ by inversion. Then, 1 - γ acts as 1 - (-1) = 2 on ℤ. The norm map N is 1 + γ = 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of multiplication by 2 on ℤ modulo the image of 0, which is 2ℤ / 0 ≅ 2ℤ. But H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) should be a torsion group, but 2ℤ is torsion-free. This suggests something is wrong. 

Wait, perhaps in group cohomology with coefficients in a non-trivial module, H² can be torsion even if the coefficients are torsion-free. But here, the calculation seems to give 2ℤ, which is incorrect. There must be an error in the setup. 

Alternatively, maybe I should use the Tate cohomology. For finite cyclic groups, the Tate cohomology groups are periodic with period 2. But Tate cohomology is defined for finite groups and modules, and in this case, H^2 would be isomorphic to H^0, which for Tate cohomology is A^G / N(A). For our case, A=ℤ with γ acting as -1. Then A^G = {0}, and N(A) = 0, so H^0 = 0. Hence, H² would also be 0. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. 

But this contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group extension. Therefore, perhaps the infinite dihedral group is not a valid extension in this context? Wait, no, the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian group which is an extension of ℤ_2 by ℤ. However, the action is non-trivial, but if we consider the extension as one where the base group is ℤ and the quotient is ℤ_2, then the group is ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2. However, in this case, the ℤ_2 is acting on ℤ, so the module structure is non-trivial. Therefore, such an extension is classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to the cohomology calculation, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which would imply that there are no such extensions. But this is a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the confusion arises because ℤ is not a projective ℤ[G]-module when G acts non-trivially. In the case of the infinite dihedral group, the extension is split, so it corresponds to a semi-direct product, which is classified by a 1-cocycle in H¹(G, Aut(N)), not H². Wait, group extensions with non-abelian kernel are classified by H¹(G, Aut(N)), but in our case, N=ℤ is abelian, so Aut(N)=ℤ×. However, for non-abelian extensions, the action is given by a homomorphism from G to Aut(N), and the extensions are classified by H²(G, Z(N)), where Z(N) is the center. But since N=ℤ is abelian, Z(N)=N, so H²(G, N) classifies extensions with the given action. 

But in our case, if the action is non-trivial, then the extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to our previous calculation, this is 0. However, the infinite dihedral group exists. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation. 

Wait, actually, the infinite dihedral group is a split extension, so it corresponds to the zero element in H²(G, N). But if H²(G, N) is trivial, then all extensions are split. However, the infinite dihedral group is split, so that&#x27;s consistent. Therefore, if H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0 with the non-trivial action, then all extensions with that action are split. But in our case, the only extensions are the split ones. But the infinite dihedral group is indeed a split extension. 

But then, for the trivial action, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Wait, let me recast the problem. If we consider the trivial action, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Because in that case, 1 - γ is the zero map, and N is multiplication by 2. So H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of 0 modulo image of 2, which is ℤ / 2ℤ. Therefore, if the action is trivial, there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. But if the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, so only the split extension exists. 

But the infinite dihedral group is a split extension with the non-trivial action, so it corresponds to the trivial element in H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with non-trivial action. Therefore, if we consider the action as part of the data, then when the action is non-trivial, all extensions are split. When the action is trivial, there are two extensions. 

But in our original problem, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ), the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify the action, but in the case of group extensions, the action is part of the data. However, if we fix the action to be trivial, then for p=2, we have H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, leading to two extensions. But for odd p, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, leading to p extensions. But earlier, we saw that when considering abelian extensions, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. However, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) (for trivial action) is also ℤ_p. 

Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify. For abelian extensions, where the action is trivial, the extensions are classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For group extensions (possibly non-abelian), with trivial action, they are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. But when the action is non-trivial, for p=2, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) =0. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether we are considering the action as part of the data or not. The problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which usually means that ℤ is the kernel and ℤ_p is the quotient. The action is then determined by the conjugation in the group. For abelian extensions, the action must be trivial. For non-abelian extensions, the action can be non-trivial if possible. 

But since ℤ is abelian, the conjugation action of G on ℤ must be trivial on ℤ, so the action factors through G/ℤ ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the action is a homomorphism ℤ_p → Aut(ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2. For p odd, there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from ℤ_p to ℤ_2 since p is odd and ℤ_p has no elements of order 2. Therefore, for p odd, the action must be trivial, so all extensions are abelian and classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there is a non-trivial homomorphism from ℤ_2 to Aut(ℤ), given by inversion. Therefore, extensions can have either trivial or non-trivial action. 

For p=2, if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, so there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ)=0, so only the split extension exists (the infinite dihedral group). Therefore, the total number of extensions is three? Wait, no. When considering group extensions with a given module structure, the action is fixed. Therefore, if we fix the action to be trivial, then there are two extensions. If we fix the action to be non-trivial, there&#x27;s one extension. But in the problem statement, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) without specifying the action, which could mean considering all possible actions. 

But in the literature, when the action is not specified, it&#x27;s usually assumed to be trivial. Alternatively, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might consider all possible extensions with any possible action. In that case, for p=2, we have extensions with trivial action (two) and extensions with non-trivial action (one). But I need to confirm this. 

However, given that the problem mentions &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which is somewhat ambiguous, but in the context of abelian groups, it&#x27;s more likely referring to abelian extensions. Moreover, if the problem is from a course on homological algebra or algebraic topology, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might denote the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions, which would be Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Therefore, taking into account that for each prime p, whether p=2 or odd, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, the structure of E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a cyclic group of order p. Hence, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ is in bijection with ℤ_p, and as a group under the Baer sum, it is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

Therefore, the final answer is that the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is in bijection with ℤ_p, and its structure is that of the cyclic group of order p.

**Final Answer**
The set of equivalence classes of extensions is the cyclic group of order \( p \), so \( E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \) is isomorphic to \( \boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p} \).
&lt;/think&gt;

To compute the equivalence classes of extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\), denoted as \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\), we consider both the group cohomology and homological algebra perspectives. 

1. **Abelian Extensions**: 
   - For abelian extensions, we use the Ext functor. Specifically, we need to compute \(\text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\).
   - Using the projective resolution of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\):
     \[
     0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{p} \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0
     \]
   - Applying \(\text{Hom}(-, \mathbb{Z})\) and considering the long exact sequence, we find:
     \[
     \text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_p
     \]
   - This result indicates that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\) are classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\).

2. **Group Cohomology**:
   - For non-abelian extensions, we consider group cohomology \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\). However, since \(\mathbb{Z}\) is a trivial \(\mathbb{Z}_p\)-module and \(\mathbb{Z}\) is torsion-free, the cohomology group \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) also leads to the same result for trivial actions.
   - For \(p = 2\), non-trivial actions (inversion) are possible, but they do not contribute additional equivalence classes as shown by cohomology calculations.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) of equivalence classes of extensions, whether considered as abelian extensions or group extensions with trivial action, is classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\). This structure holds for both odd and even primes \(p\).

Thus, the structure of the set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) is the cyclic group of order \(p\), leading to the final answer:

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to compute the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ, denoted as E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and figure out the structure of this set. Hmm, extensions of groups, right? I remember that in group theory, an extension of a group Q by a group N is a group G such that N is a normal subgroup of G and G/N is isomorphic to Q. So in this case, we&#x27;re looking at extensions where the quotient group is ℤ_p and the normal subgroup is ℤ. 

First, let me recall the general theory of group extensions. Extensions are classified by the second cohomology group H²(Q, N), where the action of Q on N is given by some module structure. But here, both N and Q are abelian groups, so the extensions should also be abelian. Wait, is that right? If both groups are abelian, then the extension is also abelian if the action is trivial? Maybe I need to be careful here.

Let me double-check. For abelian extensions, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N is isomorphic to Ext¹(Q, N). But in general, group extensions (not necessarily abelian) are classified by H²(Q, N). But since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, maybe we&#x27;re dealing with abelian extensions here. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify whether the extensions are required to be abelian, but since both groups are abelian, it&#x27;s possible that we are considering central extensions, which would be classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But I need to verify this.

Wait, Ext¹ is for abelian extensions, right? Let me recall: For abelian groups, the Ext functor in homological algebra classifies extensions. Specifically, Ext¹(Q, N) corresponds to the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N. So if we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions, then we need to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). However, if we consider arbitrary group extensions, then it would be H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But since ℤ is a trivial ℤ_p-module in the case of group cohomology? Wait, but ℤ_p acts on ℤ? How?

Wait, in group cohomology, the coefficients have to be a module over the group. So ℤ here would need to be a ℤ_p-module. If the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) would classify central extensions. But ℤ_p is cyclic of order p, and ℤ is torsion-free. So maybe the only action possible is trivial. Because any automorphism of ℤ is multiplication by ±1, but since ℤ_p is a cyclic group of order p, the action has to satisfy that applying the automorphism p times is the identity. But if we have multiplication by -1, then applying it p times would be multiplication by (-1)^p. If p is odd, this is -1, which is not the identity. If p=2, then it&#x27;s 1. So for p=2, a nontrivial action is possible, but for odd p, only the trivial action is possible. Wait, so maybe for p=2, ℤ could have a nontrivial ℤ_2 module structure where the generator acts as multiplication by -1. But ℤ is written additively, so the action would be x ↦ -x. Then, applying it twice would give the identity, which works for ℤ_2.

But in the problem statement, are we considering arbitrary extensions, or central extensions? The notation E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a bit ambiguous. In the literature, sometimes E(G, A) denotes equivalence classes of extensions of G by A, which could be nonabelian. But given that both ℤ_p and ℤ are abelian, if we consider abelian extensions, then the extensions would also be abelian groups. Alternatively, if we allow nonabelian extensions, even with abelian kernel and quotient, the set might be larger. But in general, I think that when dealing with abelian groups, people often consider abelian extensions, so perhaps the question is about abelian extensions. Let me check.

If we are to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ), then since Ext¹ is the derived functor, we can compute it using a projective resolution of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s recall that ℤ_p is isomorphic to ℤ / pℤ. So we can take the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, where the first map is multiplication by p. Applying the functor Hom(-, ℤ), we get the long exact sequence:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ, ℤ) → ...

But Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) is 0 because ℤ is torsion-free and ℤ_p is torsion. Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is isomorphic to ℤ, generated by the identity map. The map Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is induced by multiplication by p, so it&#x27;s also multiplication by p in Hom(ℤ, ℤ) ≅ ℤ. Therefore, the kernel is 0 and the cokernel is ℤ / pℤ. Then, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Wait, so this would mean that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ are in bijection with ℤ_p. Each element of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) corresponds to an abelian extension. So the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. But what do these extensions look like?

An abelian extension would be an abelian group G with a subgroup isomorphic to ℤ such that the quotient is isomorphic to ℤ_p. Since G is abelian and ℤ is a free abelian group, any such extension must split, right? Wait, no. If the extension splits, then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, but ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, whereas ℤ is torsion-free. Wait, but ℤ_p has torsion. Wait, but G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, so there is an exact sequence 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If the extension splits, then G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free because it has elements of order p. But the image of ℤ in G is a normal subgroup (since G is abelian) and the quotient is ℤ_p. However, if the extension doesn&#x27;t split, then G would have to be torsion-free? Wait, but how?

Wait, if G is an abelian group containing ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G is generated by the elements of ℤ and a preimage of the generator of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s suppose that ℤ is generated by x, and the generator of ℤ_p is y + ℤ. Then in G, we have that p(y + ℤ) = 0, so py ∈ ℤ. Therefore, py = nx for some integer n. Therefore, G is generated by x and y with relation py = nx. So depending on n, we can get different extensions. However, since n is an integer, but we can adjust y by multiples of x, so different n&#x27;s can give equivalent extensions. Specifically, if we replace y by y + kx, then p(y + kx) = py + pkx = nx + pkx = (n + pk)x. Therefore, n is determined modulo pℤ. Hence, the equivalence classes are parameterized by ℤ_p. So each extension is determined by an integer n modulo p, which tells us how many times we &quot;twist&quot; the generator y around the subgroup ℤ. Therefore, the equivalence classes are in bijection with ℤ_p. 

But in the case when n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in G, but G is generated by x and y with py = 0. Wait, but x has infinite order, and y has order p. Then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, which is the split extension. For other values of n, we get non-split extensions. For example, take n=1. Then G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x = py, so G is generated by y, with the relation that p^2 y = 0? Wait, no, wait. If py = x, then x is in the subgroup generated by y. Therefore, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, since x and y are related by py = x. Then, the quotient G / ℤ would be generated by y + ℤ, and since py = x ∈ ℤ, we have p(y + ℤ) = 0 in G / ℤ. So G / ℤ is cyclic of order p. But G itself is generated by y, and since x = py, then G is isomorphic to ℤ via y ↦ 1. But then G / ℤ would be ℤ / pℤ, which is correct. Wait, but then G is just ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ? Wait, that can&#x27;t be. If G is ℤ, then the subgroup would have to be pℤ, and the quotient would be ℤ_p. But that&#x27;s exactly the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0 where the first map is multiplication by p. So in this case, the extension is equivalent to the trivial extension? Wait, no. Wait, if n=1, then the extension is 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, but this is not split. Because in this case, G is ℤ, which can&#x27;t be written as a direct product of ℤ and ℤ_p. 

Wait, but if we have G being ℤ with the subgroup pℤ, then G is indeed just ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. So this is a non-split extension. But if we take n=0, then the extension would be split: 0 → ℤ → ℤ × ℤ_p → ℤ_p → 0. So the equivalence classes of extensions are in correspondence with n mod p, which is ℤ_p. So Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) of equivalence classes of abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

But hold on, earlier I thought that G can be generated by y with relation p^2 y = 0 if n=1, but that&#x27;s not correct. Because if we set py = x, which is in ℤ, then x is a generator of ℤ. So G is actually generated by y, and x is just py. Therefore, G is still ℤ, with y being a generator. Then the subgroup ℤ inside G is generated by x = py. Therefore, G is isomorphic to ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ. So indeed, this is the extension where ℤ is included as pℤ inside ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ / pℤ = ℤ_p. So all these extensions are actually isomorphic to ℤ, but with different embeddings of the subgroup. Wait, but in the category of abelian groups, how do we consider equivalence of extensions? 

Two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s a commutative diagram:

0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0

  ↓      ↓       ↓

0 → ℤ → G&#x27; → ℤ_p → 0

With the middle arrow being an isomorphism. So even if G and G&#x27; are both isomorphic to ℤ, but the embeddings of ℤ are different, then the extensions might not be equivalent. For example, if we have two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is coprime to p, then these would be inequivalent extensions. Wait, but in our case, the embeddings are determined by n mod p. For each n mod p, the embedding is multiplication by n. But if n is invertible mod p, does that give a different embedding? Wait, but in the case of n=1, the embedding is pℤ, and if n is coprime to p, say n=2, then the embedding is 2pℤ? Wait, no. Wait, in the extension corresponding to n, the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, and we have py = nx. So if n is coprime to p, then x is a multiple of py. For example, if n=1, x = py. If n=2, x = py, so 2x = p(2y). But 2 is invertible mod p if p is odd, so 2y would generate the same subgroup as y. Wait, maybe this is getting confused. 

Alternatively, maybe all these extensions are isomorphic as groups, but the specific embeddings are different. However, in the category of abelian groups, the automorphisms of ℤ are limited to multiplication by ±1. So if two embeddings differ by a automorphism of ℤ, then the extensions are equivalent. So if the embedding is given by multiplication by n, then if we can find an automorphism of ℤ (i.e., multiplication by ±1) such that n is sent to another integer, but since n is mod p, we can adjust n by ±1. But actually, the equivalence classes are determined by the module structure, so maybe the parameter n is considered up to automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. 

Wait, but according to the calculation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) being ℤ_p, the equivalence classes are in one-to-one correspondence with ℤ_p. So even though all the middle groups G might be isomorphic to ℤ or ℤ × ℤ_p, the actual extensions are considered different if the embeddings or the projections are different. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which is not isomorphic to ℤ. But when we have non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So actually, how come some extensions have G ≅ ℤ and others G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p? 

Wait, no, actually, in the case of the non-split extensions, G is always ℤ. Because if you have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0, then G has to be torsion-free if it&#x27;s abelian, because ℤ is torsion-free. But ℤ × ℤ_p has torsion, so it can&#x27;t be torsion-free. Therefore, only the non-split extensions result in G being ℤ, and the split extension would have G as ℤ × ℤ_p, which is impossible because that&#x27;s not torsion-free. Wait, this is a contradiction. 

Hold on, maybe all abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ must have G torsion-free. Therefore, the only possible extension is the non-split one. But according to our earlier calculation, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which suggests there are multiple extensions. But how can there be multiple non-isomorphic extensions? 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let&#x27;s consider the extensions. If G is abelian, torsion-free, and contains ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G must be isomorphic to ℤ. Because the only torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are ℤ and subgroups of ℚ. But if G is finitely generated (which it is, since it&#x27;s an extension of finite cyclic group by ℤ), then it must be isomorphic to ℤ. So actually, all such extensions have G ≅ ℤ, but with different embeddings. But in the category of abelian groups, two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s an isomorphism between the middle groups compatible with the embeddings and projections. 

So for example, take two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is an integer. Then these would define different extensions if k is not ±1. But since in abelian groups, automorphisms of ℤ are only ±1, the different multiples would lead to inequivalent extensions. But in our case, the extensions are parameterized by n mod p, so n can be 0,1,...,p-1. However, if n is non-zero, then the embedding is multiplication by n, but since n is invertible mod p or not? 

Wait, if we have an extension determined by n, where py = nx. If n is coprime to p, then there exists an integer m such that mn ≡ 1 mod p. Then, m py = mn x, which implies p(my) = x. Therefore, replacing y by my, we get the relation p(my) = x. Therefore, the embedding is multiplication by 1. So in this case, if n is coprime to p, the extension is equivalent to the one with n=1. If n is not coprime to p, say n and p share a common divisor d &gt;1, but since p is prime, this implies that n is a multiple of p, so n ≡ 0 mod p. Then, the extension is split. 

But wait, n is an integer, and the extensions are parameterized by n mod p. So if n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in the quotient, so G is ℤ × ℤ_p. But G must be abelian, so the only split extension is ℤ × ℤ_p. But earlier, I thought that if n ≡ 0 mod p, then the extension is split. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, so how can it be an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ? Wait, the exact sequence is 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If G is ℤ × ℤ_p, then the kernel is ℤ, embedded as (1,0), and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G has torsion, which is allowed? Wait, but the quotient is ℤ_p, which is torsion. So G can have torsion. Wait, but if the kernel is ℤ, which is torsion-free, the quotient is torsion, so G can have torsion. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which has torsion. However, in the non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So how does this work?

Wait, if G is ℤ, then the kernel is pℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G is torsion-free. So depending on whether the extension is split or not, G can be either torsion-free or have torsion. So the split extension is G = ℤ × ℤ_p, and the non-split extensions are G = ℤ. But then, if n ≠ 0 mod p, the extension is non-split, and G is ℤ. But there is only one non-split extension? But Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which would suggest there are p different extensions. 

This is confusing. Let me think again. 

We have Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So there are p equivalence classes of extensions. But how do these correspond to different groups G? For each n ∈ ℤ_p, we have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If n=0, then G is the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p. For n ≠0, G is a non-split extension. But if G is non-split, is it always isomorphic to ℤ? 

Wait, no. Let&#x27;s consider n=1. The group G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x is in the center (since G is abelian), and y has the relation that py = x. Then, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, with y as the generator. Then x = py, so the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, which is pℤ inside G. Then, the quotient G / pℤ is ℤ_p. So G is ℤ, and the extension is 0 → pℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0. 

But for n=2, if p ≠2, then the extension would be generated by x and y with py = 2x. Then, similar to the above, if we let z = y - x, then pz = py - px = 2x - px = (2 - p)x. Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, since 2 is invertible mod p (if p≠2), then there exists an integer m such that 2m ≡1 mod p. Then, replacing y with my, we get p(my) = m py = m*2x = (2m)x ≡ x mod p. Therefore, this extension is equivalent to the n=1 case. 

Therefore, for n coprime to p, the extensions are equivalent to the n=1 case. If n is not coprime to p, i.e., n=0 mod p, then it&#x27;s the split extension. Wait, but p is prime, so every n ≠0 mod p is coprime to p. Therefore, all non-zero n mod p give equivalent extensions? But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p. 

Hmm, so there must be a mistake in my reasoning here. Let&#x27;s go back to the computation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). Using the projective resolution:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → ℤ_p → 0

Applying Hom(-, ℤ), we get:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) --p*--&gt; Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → 0

Since Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) =0, this reduces to:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) →0

So the cokernel of multiplication by p is ℤ_p, hence Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, there are p distinct extensions. But if all non-zero extensions are isomorphic, then Ext¹ would be trivial or have fewer elements. So my previous reasoning that all non-zero n give equivalent extensions must be wrong. 

Wait, perhaps when considering equivalence of extensions, the automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p have to be taken into account. So two extensions are equivalent if there is a commutative diagram with automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. The automorphism group of ℤ is ℤ× = {±1}, and the automorphism group of ℤ_p is (ℤ_p)×, which has order p-1. Therefore, when considering equivalence classes of extensions, we might have to mod out by the action of these automorphism groups. However, in the calculation of Ext¹, we are considering extensions up to equivalence where the automorphisms of the kernel and quotient are not factored out. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s can be related by automorphisms of ℤ_p, in the Ext¹ calculation, these are considered distinct. Wait, no. Actually, in the definition of Ext¹, two extensions are equivalent if there exists a morphism between them that is the identity on N and Q. So automorphisms of N and Q are not considered. Therefore, even if two extensions differ by an automorphism of N or Q, they are still considered distinct in Ext¹. Therefore, in our case, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is indeed ℤ_p, with each element corresponding to a different extension. 

Therefore, even though for different n coprime to p, the groups G might be isomorphic, the extensions themselves are different because the way ℤ is embedded and the way the quotient maps are defined are different. So even if two extensions have isomorphic middle groups, if the embeddings and projections are different, they are considered non-equivalent extensions. 

So for example, take p=3. Then we have three extensions: n=0,1,2. For n=0, G=ℤ × ℤ_3. For n=1, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. For n=2, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 6ℤ? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, then the relation is 3y = 2x. If x is the generator of ℤ, then solving for x, we get x = (3/2)y. But since x must be an integer multiple of y, this is only possible if y is even. Wait, this seems problematic. 

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of group presentations. For each n, the group G is generated by x and y with the relation that py = nx. So for n=1, G is generated by x and y with 3y = x. Then, x is redundant as a generator because x = 3y, so G is generated by y, which is infinite cyclic. Therefore, G ≅ ℤ, with the subgroup generated by x = 3y. 

For n=2, G is generated by x and y with 3y = 2x. Then, we can write x = (3/2)y. But x must be an integer multiple of y, so this would require that y is divisible by 2. Let me set y = 2z. Then, x = 3z. Therefore, G is generated by z, with no relations, so G ≅ ℤ. The subgroup generated by x is 3z, so ℤ is embedded as 3ℤ in G. Wait, but this is the same as the n=1 case. So in this case, even though n=2, the group G is still ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. Therefore, the extensions corresponding to n=1 and n=2 are isomorphic? 

But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So where is the error here? 

Ah, perhaps in the equivalence of extensions, the automorphism of ℤ_p comes into play. If we have two extensions where the only difference is an automorphism of ℤ_p, then they would be considered equivalent. For example, if n=2 in the case p=3, then the quotient map G → ℤ_3 sends y to 1 + 3ℤ. But if we compose this with the automorphism of ℤ_3 that multiplies by 2, then the quotient map becomes y ↦ 2 + 3ℤ. Then, the relation becomes 3y = 2x, but after the automorphism, it&#x27;s equivalent to 3y = x. Therefore, the extensions n=1 and n=2 are equivalent under the automorphism of ℤ_p. 

But in the definition of Ext¹, when we compute Ext¹(Q, N), we consider extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are the identity. Therefore, if we allow automorphisms of Q, then different extensions could become equivalent. However, in the standard definition, Ext¹(Q, N) classifies extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are identities. Therefore, in our case, the different n&#x27;s correspond to different extensions even if they are related by automorphisms of Q. 

But in the example above, with p=3, n=1 and n=2 would give extensions that are isomorphic as groups, but the specific quotient maps differ by an automorphism of ℤ_p. Therefore, if we consider extensions up to isomorphism of the groups G, then there are only two isomorphism classes: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p and the non-split extension ℤ. But according to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, there are p equivalence classes of extensions. Therefore, the distinction is in the specific way the quotient is taken and the subgroup is embedded, not just the isomorphism class of G. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s may lead to isomorphic middle groups G, the extensions themselves are different because the maps are different. Hence, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has p elements, corresponding to the p different extensions. The structure of this set is therefore a cyclic group of order p, i.e., ℤ_p. 

But wait, is the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) actually a group? In the context of abelian extensions, yes, the Baer sum gives an abelian group structure on E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and it is isomorphic to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has the structure of the group ℤ_p. 

Alternatively, if we consider non-abelian extensions, but since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, all extensions are abelian. Wait, is that true? Let me check. If G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, then G is necessarily abelian? 

Suppose G is a group with a normal subgroup N ≅ ℤ and G/N ≅ ℤ_p. Is G necessarily abelian? 

Take an element y ∈ G such that the image of y in G/N generates G/N. Then, since G/N has order p, we have y^p ∈ N. Also, since N is abelian, the commutator [y, x] for x ∈ N must lie in N. But N is central in G? Not necessarily. Wait, if N is central, then G is abelian. But if N is not central, then G could be non-abelian. 

But ℤ is a cyclic group, so its automorphism group is ℤ× ≅ {±1}. Therefore, the action of y on N by conjugation must be an automorphism of N. Let’s suppose that conjugation by y acts as multiplication by k on N ≅ ℤ. Then, since y^p ∈ N, we have y^p x y^{-p} = x. But y^p is in N, which is abelian, so conjugation by y^p is trivial. Therefore, the automorphism induced by y must satisfy that its order divides p. But the automorphism group of ℤ is {1, -1}, so the only possibilities are that conjugation by y acts trivially (k=1) or as inversion (k=-1). If p is odd, then inversion has order 2, which does not divide p, unless p=2. Therefore, for odd p, the action must be trivial, so G is abelian. For p=2, inversion has order 2, which divides p=2, so non-abelian extensions are possible. 

Therefore, for p odd, all extensions are abelian, and E(ℤ_p, ℤ) = Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there could be non-abelian extensions. But since the problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t specify whether they are abelian or not, we might need to consider both cases. However, in the case of abelian extensions, as I computed before, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For non-abelian extensions when p=2, let&#x27;s see. 

For p=2, we can have a non-abelian extension where the generator of ℤ_2 acts by inversion on ℤ. Then, G would be the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, where ℤ_2 acts by inversion. This is a non-abelian group. So in this case, E(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have both abelian and non-abelian extensions. However, the question is about equivalence classes of extensions. In the category of groups, extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ), where ℤ is a ℤ_p-module. For p=2, ℤ can be a non-trivial module, so H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have more elements. 

But let&#x27;s compute H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). For group cohomology, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / N(A), where N is the norm map. Wait, when the action is non-trivial, the cohomology groups can be different. Let me recall that for cyclic groups, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / (1 - γ)A, where γ is a generator of ℤ_p. But if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A / pA. But in our case, for p=2, the action could be non-trivial. Let me consider p=2 and ℤ as a ℤ_2-module with the generator acting as -1. Then, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would be computed as follows. 

The group ℤ_2 acts on ℤ by inversion. The cohomology H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) can be computed using the Tate cohomology, which for cyclic groups is H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / (1 + γ)ℤ. Here, γ is the generator of ℤ_2 acting as -1 on ℤ. The norm map is 1 + γ, which acts as 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / 0 = ℤ^{ℤ_2}. But ℤ^{ℤ_2} is the set of elements fixed by the ℤ_2 action. Since the action is inversion, the fixed points are {x ∈ ℤ | -x = x} = {0}. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. Wait, but that would mean there are no non-abelian extensions? But we know that the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian extension. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recall that for group cohomology, H²(G, A) classifies extensions of G by A that are compatible with the module structure. If A is a trivial G-module, then H²(G, A) classifies central extensions. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(G, A) classifies extensions where the conjugation action of G on A matches the module structure. 

In the case of the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, the action is non-trivial (inversion), so this corresponds to a non-trivial ℤ_2-module structure on ℤ. Therefore, the extension is classified by an element of H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. However, according to the calculation above, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group. 

Wait, but maybe I need to use the fact that ℤ is a torsion-free module. Let me check another approach. For a cyclic group G = ℤ_p, the cohomology groups can be computed using the resolution:

... → ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] --N--&gt; ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] → ℤ → 0

where γ is a generator of G, and N is the norm element 1 + γ + ... + γ^{p-1}.

Then, applying Hom(-, A), we get the cochain complex:

0 → Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --N*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; ...

For H²(G, A), we need the second cohomology, which is the kernel of (1-γ)* modulo the image of N*. 

But Hom(ℤ[G], A) ≅ A, since ℤ[G] is free abelian of rank 1. Therefore, the complex becomes:

0 → A --1-γ--&gt; A --N--&gt; A --1-γ--&gt; ...

So H²(G, A) is the kernel of 1 - γ : A → A modulo the image of N : A → A. 

For our case, G=ℤ_2 acting on ℤ by inversion. Then, 1 - γ acts as 1 - (-1) = 2 on ℤ. The norm map N is 1 + γ = 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of multiplication by 2 on ℤ modulo the image of 0, which is 2ℤ / 0 ≅ 2ℤ. But H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) should be a torsion group, but 2ℤ is torsion-free. This suggests something is wrong. 

Wait, perhaps in group cohomology with coefficients in a non-trivial module, H² can be torsion even if the coefficients are torsion-free. But here, the calculation seems to give 2ℤ, which is incorrect. There must be an error in the setup. 

Alternatively, maybe I should use the Tate cohomology. For finite cyclic groups, the Tate cohomology groups are periodic with period 2. But Tate cohomology is defined for finite groups and modules, and in this case, H^2 would be isomorphic to H^0, which for Tate cohomology is A^G / N(A). For our case, A=ℤ with γ acting as -1. Then A^G = {0}, and N(A) = 0, so H^0 = 0. Hence, H² would also be 0. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. 

But this contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group extension. Therefore, perhaps the infinite dihedral group is not a valid extension in this context? Wait, no, the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian group which is an extension of ℤ_2 by ℤ. However, the action is non-trivial, but if we consider the extension as one where the base group is ℤ and the quotient is ℤ_2, then the group is ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2. However, in this case, the ℤ_2 is acting on ℤ, so the module structure is non-trivial. Therefore, such an extension is classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to the cohomology calculation, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which would imply that there are no such extensions. But this is a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the confusion arises because ℤ is not a projective ℤ[G]-module when G acts non-trivially. In the case of the infinite dihedral group, the extension is split, so it corresponds to a semi-direct product, which is classified by a 1-cocycle in H¹(G, Aut(N)), not H². Wait, group extensions with non-abelian kernel are classified by H¹(G, Aut(N)), but in our case, N=ℤ is abelian, so Aut(N)=ℤ×. However, for non-abelian extensions, the action is given by a homomorphism from G to Aut(N), and the extensions are classified by H²(G, Z(N)), where Z(N) is the center. But since N=ℤ is abelian, Z(N)=N, so H²(G, N) classifies extensions with the given action. 

But in our case, if the action is non-trivial, then the extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to our previous calculation, this is 0. However, the infinite dihedral group exists. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation. 

Wait, actually, the infinite dihedral group is a split extension, so it corresponds to the zero element in H²(G, N). But if H²(G, N) is trivial, then all extensions are split. However, the infinite dihedral group is split, so that&#x27;s consistent. Therefore, if H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0 with the non-trivial action, then all extensions with that action are split. But in our case, the only extensions are the split ones. But the infinite dihedral group is indeed a split extension. 

But then, for the trivial action, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Wait, let me recast the problem. If we consider the trivial action, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Because in that case, 1 - γ is the zero map, and N is multiplication by 2. So H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of 0 modulo image of 2, which is ℤ / 2ℤ. Therefore, if the action is trivial, there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. But if the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, so only the split extension exists. 

But the infinite dihedral group is a split extension with the non-trivial action, so it corresponds to the trivial element in H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with non-trivial action. Therefore, if we consider the action as part of the data, then when the action is non-trivial, all extensions are split. When the action is trivial, there are two extensions. 

But in our original problem, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ), the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify the action, but in the case of group extensions, the action is part of the data. However, if we fix the action to be trivial, then for p=2, we have H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, leading to two extensions. But for odd p, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, leading to p extensions. But earlier, we saw that when considering abelian extensions, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. However, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) (for trivial action) is also ℤ_p. 

Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify. For abelian extensions, where the action is trivial, the extensions are classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For group extensions (possibly non-abelian), with trivial action, they are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. But when the action is non-trivial, for p=2, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) =0. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether we are considering the action as part of the data or not. The problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which usually means that ℤ is the kernel and ℤ_p is the quotient. The action is then determined by the conjugation in the group. For abelian extensions, the action must be trivial. For non-abelian extensions, the action can be non-trivial if possible. 

But since ℤ is abelian, the conjugation action of G on ℤ must be trivial on ℤ, so the action factors through G/ℤ ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the action is a homomorphism ℤ_p → Aut(ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2. For p odd, there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from ℤ_p to ℤ_2 since p is odd and ℤ_p has no elements of order 2. Therefore, for p odd, the action must be trivial, so all extensions are abelian and classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there is a non-trivial homomorphism from ℤ_2 to Aut(ℤ), given by inversion. Therefore, extensions can have either trivial or non-trivial action. 

For p=2, if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, so there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ)=0, so only the split extension exists (the infinite dihedral group). Therefore, the total number of extensions is three? Wait, no. When considering group extensions with a given module structure, the action is fixed. Therefore, if we fix the action to be trivial, then there are two extensions. If we fix the action to be non-trivial, there&#x27;s one extension. But in the problem statement, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) without specifying the action, which could mean considering all possible actions. 

But in the literature, when the action is not specified, it&#x27;s usually assumed to be trivial. Alternatively, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might consider all possible extensions with any possible action. In that case, for p=2, we have extensions with trivial action (two) and extensions with non-trivial action (one). But I need to confirm this. 

However, given that the problem mentions &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which is somewhat ambiguous, but in the context of abelian groups, it&#x27;s more likely referring to abelian extensions. Moreover, if the problem is from a course on homological algebra or algebraic topology, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might denote the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions, which would be Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Therefore, taking into account that for each prime p, whether p=2 or odd, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, the structure of E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a cyclic group of order p. Hence, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ is in bijection with ℤ_p, and as a group under the Baer sum, it is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

Therefore, the final answer is that the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is in bijection with ℤ_p, and its structure is that of the cyclic group of order p.

**Final Answer**
The set of equivalence classes of extensions is the cyclic group of order \( p \), so \( E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \) is isomorphic to \( \boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p} \).
&lt;/think&gt;

To compute the equivalence classes of extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\), denoted as \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\), we consider both the group cohomology and homological algebra perspectives. 

1. **Abelian Extensions**: 
   - For abelian extensions, we use the Ext functor. Specifically, we need to compute \(\text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\).
   - Using the projective resolution of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\):
     \[
     0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{p} \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0
     \]
   - Applying \(\text{Hom}(-, \mathbb{Z})\) and considering the long exact sequence, we find:
     \[
     \text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_p
     \]
   - This result indicates that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\) are classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\).

2. **Group Cohomology**:
   - For non-abelian extensions, we consider group cohomology \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\). However, since \(\mathbb{Z}\) is a trivial \(\mathbb{Z}_p\)-module and \(\mathbb{Z}\) is torsion-free, the cohomology group \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) also leads to the same result for trivial actions.
   - For \(p = 2\), non-trivial actions (inversion) are possible, but they do not contribute additional equivalence classes as shown by cohomology calculations.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) of equivalence classes of extensions, whether considered as abelian extensions or group extensions with trivial action, is classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\). This structure holds for both odd and even primes \(p\).

Thus, the structure of the set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) is the cyclic group of order \(p\), leading to the final answer:

\[
\boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to compute the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ, denoted as E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and figure out the structure of this set. Hmm, extensions of groups, right? I remember that in group theory, an extension of a group Q by a group N is a group G such that N is a normal subgroup of G and G/N is isomorphic to Q. So in this case, we&#x27;re looking at extensions where the quotient group is ℤ_p and the normal subgroup is ℤ. 

First, let me recall the general theory of group extensions. Extensions are classified by the second cohomology group H²(Q, N), where the action of Q on N is given by some module structure. But here, both N and Q are abelian groups, so the extensions should also be abelian. Wait, is that right? If both groups are abelian, then the extension is also abelian if the action is trivial? Maybe I need to be careful here.

Let me double-check. For abelian extensions, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N is isomorphic to Ext¹(Q, N). But in general, group extensions (not necessarily abelian) are classified by H²(Q, N). But since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, maybe we&#x27;re dealing with abelian extensions here. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify whether the extensions are required to be abelian, but since both groups are abelian, it&#x27;s possible that we are considering central extensions, which would be classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But I need to verify this.

Wait, Ext¹ is for abelian extensions, right? Let me recall: For abelian groups, the Ext functor in homological algebra classifies extensions. Specifically, Ext¹(Q, N) corresponds to the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N. So if we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions, then we need to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). However, if we consider arbitrary group extensions, then it would be H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But since ℤ is a trivial ℤ_p-module in the case of group cohomology? Wait, but ℤ_p acts on ℤ? How?

Wait, in group cohomology, the coefficients have to be a module over the group. So ℤ here would need to be a ℤ_p-module. If the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) would classify central extensions. But ℤ_p is cyclic of order p, and ℤ is torsion-free. So maybe the only action possible is trivial. Because any automorphism of ℤ is multiplication by ±1, but since ℤ_p is a cyclic group of order p, the action has to satisfy that applying the automorphism p times is the identity. But if we have multiplication by -1, then applying it p times would be multiplication by (-1)^p. If p is odd, this is -1, which is not the identity. If p=2, then it&#x27;s 1. So for p=2, a nontrivial action is possible, but for odd p, only the trivial action is possible. Wait, so maybe for p=2, ℤ could have a nontrivial ℤ_2 module structure where the generator acts as multiplication by -1. But ℤ is written additively, so the action would be x ↦ -x. Then, applying it twice would give the identity, which works for ℤ_2.

But in the problem statement, are we considering arbitrary extensions, or central extensions? The notation E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a bit ambiguous. In the literature, sometimes E(G, A) denotes equivalence classes of extensions of G by A, which could be nonabelian. But given that both ℤ_p and ℤ are abelian, if we consider abelian extensions, then the extensions would also be abelian groups. Alternatively, if we allow nonabelian extensions, even with abelian kernel and quotient, the set might be larger. But in general, I think that when dealing with abelian groups, people often consider abelian extensions, so perhaps the question is about abelian extensions. Let me check.

If we are to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ), then since Ext¹ is the derived functor, we can compute it using a projective resolution of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s recall that ℤ_p is isomorphic to ℤ / pℤ. So we can take the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, where the first map is multiplication by p. Applying the functor Hom(-, ℤ), we get the long exact sequence:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ, ℤ) → ...

But Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) is 0 because ℤ is torsion-free and ℤ_p is torsion. Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is isomorphic to ℤ, generated by the identity map. The map Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is induced by multiplication by p, so it&#x27;s also multiplication by p in Hom(ℤ, ℤ) ≅ ℤ. Therefore, the kernel is 0 and the cokernel is ℤ / pℤ. Then, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Wait, so this would mean that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ are in bijection with ℤ_p. Each element of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) corresponds to an abelian extension. So the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. But what do these extensions look like?

An abelian extension would be an abelian group G with a subgroup isomorphic to ℤ such that the quotient is isomorphic to ℤ_p. Since G is abelian and ℤ is a free abelian group, any such extension must split, right? Wait, no. If the extension splits, then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, but ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, whereas ℤ is torsion-free. Wait, but ℤ_p has torsion. Wait, but G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, so there is an exact sequence 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If the extension splits, then G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free because it has elements of order p. But the image of ℤ in G is a normal subgroup (since G is abelian) and the quotient is ℤ_p. However, if the extension doesn&#x27;t split, then G would have to be torsion-free? Wait, but how?

Wait, if G is an abelian group containing ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G is generated by the elements of ℤ and a preimage of the generator of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s suppose that ℤ is generated by x, and the generator of ℤ_p is y + ℤ. Then in G, we have that p(y + ℤ) = 0, so py ∈ ℤ. Therefore, py = nx for some integer n. Therefore, G is generated by x and y with relation py = nx. So depending on n, we can get different extensions. However, since n is an integer, but we can adjust y by multiples of x, so different n&#x27;s can give equivalent extensions. Specifically, if we replace y by y + kx, then p(y + kx) = py + pkx = nx + pkx = (n + pk)x. Therefore, n is determined modulo pℤ. Hence, the equivalence classes are parameterized by ℤ_p. So each extension is determined by an integer n modulo p, which tells us how many times we &quot;twist&quot; the generator y around the subgroup ℤ. Therefore, the equivalence classes are in bijection with ℤ_p. 

But in the case when n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in G, but G is generated by x and y with py = 0. Wait, but x has infinite order, and y has order p. Then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, which is the split extension. For other values of n, we get non-split extensions. For example, take n=1. Then G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x = py, so G is generated by y, with the relation that p^2 y = 0? Wait, no, wait. If py = x, then x is in the subgroup generated by y. Therefore, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, since x and y are related by py = x. Then, the quotient G / ℤ would be generated by y + ℤ, and since py = x ∈ ℤ, we have p(y + ℤ) = 0 in G / ℤ. So G / ℤ is cyclic of order p. But G itself is generated by y, and since x = py, then G is isomorphic to ℤ via y ↦ 1. But then G / ℤ would be ℤ / pℤ, which is correct. Wait, but then G is just ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ? Wait, that can&#x27;t be. If G is ℤ, then the subgroup would have to be pℤ, and the quotient would be ℤ_p. But that&#x27;s exactly the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0 where the first map is multiplication by p. So in this case, the extension is equivalent to the trivial extension? Wait, no. Wait, if n=1, then the extension is 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, but this is not split. Because in this case, G is ℤ, which can&#x27;t be written as a direct product of ℤ and ℤ_p. 

Wait, but if we have G being ℤ with the subgroup pℤ, then G is indeed just ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. So this is a non-split extension. But if we take n=0, then the extension would be split: 0 → ℤ → ℤ × ℤ_p → ℤ_p → 0. So the equivalence classes of extensions are in correspondence with n mod p, which is ℤ_p. So Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) of equivalence classes of abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

But hold on, earlier I thought that G can be generated by y with relation p^2 y = 0 if n=1, but that&#x27;s not correct. Because if we set py = x, which is in ℤ, then x is a generator of ℤ. So G is actually generated by y, and x is just py. Therefore, G is still ℤ, with y being a generator. Then the subgroup ℤ inside G is generated by x = py. Therefore, G is isomorphic to ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ. So indeed, this is the extension where ℤ is included as pℤ inside ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ / pℤ = ℤ_p. So all these extensions are actually isomorphic to ℤ, but with different embeddings of the subgroup. Wait, but in the category of abelian groups, how do we consider equivalence of extensions? 

Two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s a commutative diagram:

0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0

  ↓      ↓       ↓

0 → ℤ → G&#x27; → ℤ_p → 0

With the middle arrow being an isomorphism. So even if G and G&#x27; are both isomorphic to ℤ, but the embeddings of ℤ are different, then the extensions might not be equivalent. For example, if we have two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is coprime to p, then these would be inequivalent extensions. Wait, but in our case, the embeddings are determined by n mod p. For each n mod p, the embedding is multiplication by n. But if n is invertible mod p, does that give a different embedding? Wait, but in the case of n=1, the embedding is pℤ, and if n is coprime to p, say n=2, then the embedding is 2pℤ? Wait, no. Wait, in the extension corresponding to n, the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, and we have py = nx. So if n is coprime to p, then x is a multiple of py. For example, if n=1, x = py. If n=2, x = py, so 2x = p(2y). But 2 is invertible mod p if p is odd, so 2y would generate the same subgroup as y. Wait, maybe this is getting confused. 

Alternatively, maybe all these extensions are isomorphic as groups, but the specific embeddings are different. However, in the category of abelian groups, the automorphisms of ℤ are limited to multiplication by ±1. So if two embeddings differ by a automorphism of ℤ, then the extensions are equivalent. So if the embedding is given by multiplication by n, then if we can find an automorphism of ℤ (i.e., multiplication by ±1) such that n is sent to another integer, but since n is mod p, we can adjust n by ±1. But actually, the equivalence classes are determined by the module structure, so maybe the parameter n is considered up to automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. 

Wait, but according to the calculation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) being ℤ_p, the equivalence classes are in one-to-one correspondence with ℤ_p. So even though all the middle groups G might be isomorphic to ℤ or ℤ × ℤ_p, the actual extensions are considered different if the embeddings or the projections are different. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which is not isomorphic to ℤ. But when we have non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So actually, how come some extensions have G ≅ ℤ and others G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p? 

Wait, no, actually, in the case of the non-split extensions, G is always ℤ. Because if you have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0, then G has to be torsion-free if it&#x27;s abelian, because ℤ is torsion-free. But ℤ × ℤ_p has torsion, so it can&#x27;t be torsion-free. Therefore, only the non-split extensions result in G being ℤ, and the split extension would have G as ℤ × ℤ_p, which is impossible because that&#x27;s not torsion-free. Wait, this is a contradiction. 

Hold on, maybe all abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ must have G torsion-free. Therefore, the only possible extension is the non-split one. But according to our earlier calculation, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which suggests there are multiple extensions. But how can there be multiple non-isomorphic extensions? 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let&#x27;s consider the extensions. If G is abelian, torsion-free, and contains ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G must be isomorphic to ℤ. Because the only torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are ℤ and subgroups of ℚ. But if G is finitely generated (which it is, since it&#x27;s an extension of finite cyclic group by ℤ), then it must be isomorphic to ℤ. So actually, all such extensions have G ≅ ℤ, but with different embeddings. But in the category of abelian groups, two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s an isomorphism between the middle groups compatible with the embeddings and projections. 

So for example, take two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is an integer. Then these would define different extensions if k is not ±1. But since in abelian groups, automorphisms of ℤ are only ±1, the different multiples would lead to inequivalent extensions. But in our case, the extensions are parameterized by n mod p, so n can be 0,1,...,p-1. However, if n is non-zero, then the embedding is multiplication by n, but since n is invertible mod p or not? 

Wait, if we have an extension determined by n, where py = nx. If n is coprime to p, then there exists an integer m such that mn ≡ 1 mod p. Then, m py = mn x, which implies p(my) = x. Therefore, replacing y by my, we get the relation p(my) = x. Therefore, the embedding is multiplication by 1. So in this case, if n is coprime to p, the extension is equivalent to the one with n=1. If n is not coprime to p, say n and p share a common divisor d &gt;1, but since p is prime, this implies that n is a multiple of p, so n ≡ 0 mod p. Then, the extension is split. 

But wait, n is an integer, and the extensions are parameterized by n mod p. So if n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in the quotient, so G is ℤ × ℤ_p. But G must be abelian, so the only split extension is ℤ × ℤ_p. But earlier, I thought that if n ≡ 0 mod p, then the extension is split. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, so how can it be an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ? Wait, the exact sequence is 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If G is ℤ × ℤ_p, then the kernel is ℤ, embedded as (1,0), and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G has torsion, which is allowed? Wait, but the quotient is ℤ_p, which is torsion. So G can have torsion. Wait, but if the kernel is ℤ, which is torsion-free, the quotient is torsion, so G can have torsion. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which has torsion. However, in the non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So how does this work?

Wait, if G is ℤ, then the kernel is pℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G is torsion-free. So depending on whether the extension is split or not, G can be either torsion-free or have torsion. So the split extension is G = ℤ × ℤ_p, and the non-split extensions are G = ℤ. But then, if n ≠ 0 mod p, the extension is non-split, and G is ℤ. But there is only one non-split extension? But Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which would suggest there are p different extensions. 

This is confusing. Let me think again. 

We have Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So there are p equivalence classes of extensions. But how do these correspond to different groups G? For each n ∈ ℤ_p, we have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If n=0, then G is the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p. For n ≠0, G is a non-split extension. But if G is non-split, is it always isomorphic to ℤ? 

Wait, no. Let&#x27;s consider n=1. The group G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x is in the center (since G is abelian), and y has the relation that py = x. Then, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, with y as the generator. Then x = py, so the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, which is pℤ inside G. Then, the quotient G / pℤ is ℤ_p. So G is ℤ, and the extension is 0 → pℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0. 

But for n=2, if p ≠2, then the extension would be generated by x and y with py = 2x. Then, similar to the above, if we let z = y - x, then pz = py - px = 2x - px = (2 - p)x. Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, since 2 is invertible mod p (if p≠2), then there exists an integer m such that 2m ≡1 mod p. Then, replacing y with my, we get p(my) = m py = m*2x = (2m)x ≡ x mod p. Therefore, this extension is equivalent to the n=1 case. 

Therefore, for n coprime to p, the extensions are equivalent to the n=1 case. If n is not coprime to p, i.e., n=0 mod p, then it&#x27;s the split extension. Wait, but p is prime, so every n ≠0 mod p is coprime to p. Therefore, all non-zero n mod p give equivalent extensions? But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p. 

Hmm, so there must be a mistake in my reasoning here. Let&#x27;s go back to the computation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). Using the projective resolution:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → ℤ_p → 0

Applying Hom(-, ℤ), we get:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) --p*--&gt; Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → 0

Since Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) =0, this reduces to:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) →0

So the cokernel of multiplication by p is ℤ_p, hence Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, there are p distinct extensions. But if all non-zero extensions are isomorphic, then Ext¹ would be trivial or have fewer elements. So my previous reasoning that all non-zero n give equivalent extensions must be wrong. 

Wait, perhaps when considering equivalence of extensions, the automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p have to be taken into account. So two extensions are equivalent if there is a commutative diagram with automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. The automorphism group of ℤ is ℤ× = {±1}, and the automorphism group of ℤ_p is (ℤ_p)×, which has order p-1. Therefore, when considering equivalence classes of extensions, we might have to mod out by the action of these automorphism groups. However, in the calculation of Ext¹, we are considering extensions up to equivalence where the automorphisms of the kernel and quotient are not factored out. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s can be related by automorphisms of ℤ_p, in the Ext¹ calculation, these are considered distinct. Wait, no. Actually, in the definition of Ext¹, two extensions are equivalent if there exists a morphism between them that is the identity on N and Q. So automorphisms of N and Q are not considered. Therefore, even if two extensions differ by an automorphism of N or Q, they are still considered distinct in Ext¹. Therefore, in our case, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is indeed ℤ_p, with each element corresponding to a different extension. 

Therefore, even though for different n coprime to p, the groups G might be isomorphic, the extensions themselves are different because the way ℤ is embedded and the way the quotient maps are defined are different. So even if two extensions have isomorphic middle groups, if the embeddings and projections are different, they are considered non-equivalent extensions. 

So for example, take p=3. Then we have three extensions: n=0,1,2. For n=0, G=ℤ × ℤ_3. For n=1, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. For n=2, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 6ℤ? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, then the relation is 3y = 2x. If x is the generator of ℤ, then solving for x, we get x = (3/2)y. But since x must be an integer multiple of y, this is only possible if y is even. Wait, this seems problematic. 

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of group presentations. For each n, the group G is generated by x and y with the relation that py = nx. So for n=1, G is generated by x and y with 3y = x. Then, x is redundant as a generator because x = 3y, so G is generated by y, which is infinite cyclic. Therefore, G ≅ ℤ, with the subgroup generated by x = 3y. 

For n=2, G is generated by x and y with 3y = 2x. Then, we can write x = (3/2)y. But x must be an integer multiple of y, so this would require that y is divisible by 2. Let me set y = 2z. Then, x = 3z. Therefore, G is generated by z, with no relations, so G ≅ ℤ. The subgroup generated by x is 3z, so ℤ is embedded as 3ℤ in G. Wait, but this is the same as the n=1 case. So in this case, even though n=2, the group G is still ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. Therefore, the extensions corresponding to n=1 and n=2 are isomorphic? 

But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So where is the error here? 

Ah, perhaps in the equivalence of extensions, the automorphism of ℤ_p comes into play. If we have two extensions where the only difference is an automorphism of ℤ_p, then they would be considered equivalent. For example, if n=2 in the case p=3, then the quotient map G → ℤ_3 sends y to 1 + 3ℤ. But if we compose this with the automorphism of ℤ_3 that multiplies by 2, then the quotient map becomes y ↦ 2 + 3ℤ. Then, the relation becomes 3y = 2x, but after the automorphism, it&#x27;s equivalent to 3y = x. Therefore, the extensions n=1 and n=2 are equivalent under the automorphism of ℤ_p. 

But in the definition of Ext¹, when we compute Ext¹(Q, N), we consider extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are the identity. Therefore, if we allow automorphisms of Q, then different extensions could become equivalent. However, in the standard definition, Ext¹(Q, N) classifies extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are identities. Therefore, in our case, the different n&#x27;s correspond to different extensions even if they are related by automorphisms of Q. 

But in the example above, with p=3, n=1 and n=2 would give extensions that are isomorphic as groups, but the specific quotient maps differ by an automorphism of ℤ_p. Therefore, if we consider extensions up to isomorphism of the groups G, then there are only two isomorphism classes: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p and the non-split extension ℤ. But according to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, there are p equivalence classes of extensions. Therefore, the distinction is in the specific way the quotient is taken and the subgroup is embedded, not just the isomorphism class of G. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s may lead to isomorphic middle groups G, the extensions themselves are different because the maps are different. Hence, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has p elements, corresponding to the p different extensions. The structure of this set is therefore a cyclic group of order p, i.e., ℤ_p. 

But wait, is the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) actually a group? In the context of abelian extensions, yes, the Baer sum gives an abelian group structure on E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and it is isomorphic to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has the structure of the group ℤ_p. 

Alternatively, if we consider non-abelian extensions, but since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, all extensions are abelian. Wait, is that true? Let me check. If G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, then G is necessarily abelian? 

Suppose G is a group with a normal subgroup N ≅ ℤ and G/N ≅ ℤ_p. Is G necessarily abelian? 

Take an element y ∈ G such that the image of y in G/N generates G/N. Then, since G/N has order p, we have y^p ∈ N. Also, since N is abelian, the commutator [y, x] for x ∈ N must lie in N. But N is central in G? Not necessarily. Wait, if N is central, then G is abelian. But if N is not central, then G could be non-abelian. 

But ℤ is a cyclic group, so its automorphism group is ℤ× ≅ {±1}. Therefore, the action of y on N by conjugation must be an automorphism of N. Let’s suppose that conjugation by y acts as multiplication by k on N ≅ ℤ. Then, since y^p ∈ N, we have y^p x y^{-p} = x. But y^p is in N, which is abelian, so conjugation by y^p is trivial. Therefore, the automorphism induced by y must satisfy that its order divides p. But the automorphism group of ℤ is {1, -1}, so the only possibilities are that conjugation by y acts trivially (k=1) or as inversion (k=-1). If p is odd, then inversion has order 2, which does not divide p, unless p=2. Therefore, for odd p, the action must be trivial, so G is abelian. For p=2, inversion has order 2, which divides p=2, so non-abelian extensions are possible. 

Therefore, for p odd, all extensions are abelian, and E(ℤ_p, ℤ) = Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there could be non-abelian extensions. But since the problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t specify whether they are abelian or not, we might need to consider both cases. However, in the case of abelian extensions, as I computed before, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For non-abelian extensions when p=2, let&#x27;s see. 

For p=2, we can have a non-abelian extension where the generator of ℤ_2 acts by inversion on ℤ. Then, G would be the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, where ℤ_2 acts by inversion. This is a non-abelian group. So in this case, E(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have both abelian and non-abelian extensions. However, the question is about equivalence classes of extensions. In the category of groups, extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ), where ℤ is a ℤ_p-module. For p=2, ℤ can be a non-trivial module, so H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have more elements. 

But let&#x27;s compute H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). For group cohomology, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / N(A), where N is the norm map. Wait, when the action is non-trivial, the cohomology groups can be different. Let me recall that for cyclic groups, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / (1 - γ)A, where γ is a generator of ℤ_p. But if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A / pA. But in our case, for p=2, the action could be non-trivial. Let me consider p=2 and ℤ as a ℤ_2-module with the generator acting as -1. Then, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would be computed as follows. 

The group ℤ_2 acts on ℤ by inversion. The cohomology H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) can be computed using the Tate cohomology, which for cyclic groups is H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / (1 + γ)ℤ. Here, γ is the generator of ℤ_2 acting as -1 on ℤ. The norm map is 1 + γ, which acts as 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / 0 = ℤ^{ℤ_2}. But ℤ^{ℤ_2} is the set of elements fixed by the ℤ_2 action. Since the action is inversion, the fixed points are {x ∈ ℤ | -x = x} = {0}. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. Wait, but that would mean there are no non-abelian extensions? But we know that the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian extension. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recall that for group cohomology, H²(G, A) classifies extensions of G by A that are compatible with the module structure. If A is a trivial G-module, then H²(G, A) classifies central extensions. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(G, A) classifies extensions where the conjugation action of G on A matches the module structure. 

In the case of the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, the action is non-trivial (inversion), so this corresponds to a non-trivial ℤ_2-module structure on ℤ. Therefore, the extension is classified by an element of H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. However, according to the calculation above, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group. 

Wait, but maybe I need to use the fact that ℤ is a torsion-free module. Let me check another approach. For a cyclic group G = ℤ_p, the cohomology groups can be computed using the resolution:

... → ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] --N--&gt; ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] → ℤ → 0

where γ is a generator of G, and N is the norm element 1 + γ + ... + γ^{p-1}.

Then, applying Hom(-, A), we get the cochain complex:

0 → Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --N*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; ...

For H²(G, A), we need the second cohomology, which is the kernel of (1-γ)* modulo the image of N*. 

But Hom(ℤ[G], A) ≅ A, since ℤ[G] is free abelian of rank 1. Therefore, the complex becomes:

0 → A --1-γ--&gt; A --N--&gt; A --1-γ--&gt; ...

So H²(G, A) is the kernel of 1 - γ : A → A modulo the image of N : A → A. 

For our case, G=ℤ_2 acting on ℤ by inversion. Then, 1 - γ acts as 1 - (-1) = 2 on ℤ. The norm map N is 1 + γ = 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of multiplication by 2 on ℤ modulo the image of 0, which is 2ℤ / 0 ≅ 2ℤ. But H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) should be a torsion group, but 2ℤ is torsion-free. This suggests something is wrong. 

Wait, perhaps in group cohomology with coefficients in a non-trivial module, H² can be torsion even if the coefficients are torsion-free. But here, the calculation seems to give 2ℤ, which is incorrect. There must be an error in the setup. 

Alternatively, maybe I should use the Tate cohomology. For finite cyclic groups, the Tate cohomology groups are periodic with period 2. But Tate cohomology is defined for finite groups and modules, and in this case, H^2 would be isomorphic to H^0, which for Tate cohomology is A^G / N(A). For our case, A=ℤ with γ acting as -1. Then A^G = {0}, and N(A) = 0, so H^0 = 0. Hence, H² would also be 0. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. 

But this contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group extension. Therefore, perhaps the infinite dihedral group is not a valid extension in this context? Wait, no, the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian group which is an extension of ℤ_2 by ℤ. However, the action is non-trivial, but if we consider the extension as one where the base group is ℤ and the quotient is ℤ_2, then the group is ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2. However, in this case, the ℤ_2 is acting on ℤ, so the module structure is non-trivial. Therefore, such an extension is classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to the cohomology calculation, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which would imply that there are no such extensions. But this is a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the confusion arises because ℤ is not a projective ℤ[G]-module when G acts non-trivially. In the case of the infinite dihedral group, the extension is split, so it corresponds to a semi-direct product, which is classified by a 1-cocycle in H¹(G, Aut(N)), not H². Wait, group extensions with non-abelian kernel are classified by H¹(G, Aut(N)), but in our case, N=ℤ is abelian, so Aut(N)=ℤ×. However, for non-abelian extensions, the action is given by a homomorphism from G to Aut(N), and the extensions are classified by H²(G, Z(N)), where Z(N) is the center. But since N=ℤ is abelian, Z(N)=N, so H²(G, N) classifies extensions with the given action. 

But in our case, if the action is non-trivial, then the extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to our previous calculation, this is 0. However, the infinite dihedral group exists. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation. 

Wait, actually, the infinite dihedral group is a split extension, so it corresponds to the zero element in H²(G, N). But if H²(G, N) is trivial, then all extensions are split. However, the infinite dihedral group is split, so that&#x27;s consistent. Therefore, if H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0 with the non-trivial action, then all extensions with that action are split. But in our case, the only extensions are the split ones. But the infinite dihedral group is indeed a split extension. 

But then, for the trivial action, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Wait, let me recast the problem. If we consider the trivial action, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Because in that case, 1 - γ is the zero map, and N is multiplication by 2. So H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of 0 modulo image of 2, which is ℤ / 2ℤ. Therefore, if the action is trivial, there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. But if the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, so only the split extension exists. 

But the infinite dihedral group is a split extension with the non-trivial action, so it corresponds to the trivial element in H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with non-trivial action. Therefore, if we consider the action as part of the data, then when the action is non-trivial, all extensions are split. When the action is trivial, there are two extensions. 

But in our original problem, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ), the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify the action, but in the case of group extensions, the action is part of the data. However, if we fix the action to be trivial, then for p=2, we have H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, leading to two extensions. But for odd p, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, leading to p extensions. But earlier, we saw that when considering abelian extensions, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. However, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) (for trivial action) is also ℤ_p. 

Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify. For abelian extensions, where the action is trivial, the extensions are classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For group extensions (possibly non-abelian), with trivial action, they are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. But when the action is non-trivial, for p=2, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) =0. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether we are considering the action as part of the data or not. The problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which usually means that ℤ is the kernel and ℤ_p is the quotient. The action is then determined by the conjugation in the group. For abelian extensions, the action must be trivial. For non-abelian extensions, the action can be non-trivial if possible. 

But since ℤ is abelian, the conjugation action of G on ℤ must be trivial on ℤ, so the action factors through G/ℤ ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the action is a homomorphism ℤ_p → Aut(ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2. For p odd, there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from ℤ_p to ℤ_2 since p is odd and ℤ_p has no elements of order 2. Therefore, for p odd, the action must be trivial, so all extensions are abelian and classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there is a non-trivial homomorphism from ℤ_2 to Aut(ℤ), given by inversion. Therefore, extensions can have either trivial or non-trivial action. 

For p=2, if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, so there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ)=0, so only the split extension exists (the infinite dihedral group). Therefore, the total number of extensions is three? Wait, no. When considering group extensions with a given module structure, the action is fixed. Therefore, if we fix the action to be trivial, then there are two extensions. If we fix the action to be non-trivial, there&#x27;s one extension. But in the problem statement, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) without specifying the action, which could mean considering all possible actions. 

But in the literature, when the action is not specified, it&#x27;s usually assumed to be trivial. Alternatively, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might consider all possible extensions with any possible action. In that case, for p=2, we have extensions with trivial action (two) and extensions with non-trivial action (one). But I need to confirm this. 

However, given that the problem mentions &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which is somewhat ambiguous, but in the context of abelian groups, it&#x27;s more likely referring to abelian extensions. Moreover, if the problem is from a course on homological algebra or algebraic topology, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might denote the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions, which would be Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Therefore, taking into account that for each prime p, whether p=2 or odd, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, the structure of E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a cyclic group of order p. Hence, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ is in bijection with ℤ_p, and as a group under the Baer sum, it is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

Therefore, the final answer is that the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is in bijection with ℤ_p, and its structure is that of the cyclic group of order p.

**Final Answer**
The set of equivalence classes of extensions is the cyclic group of order \( p \), so \( E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \) is isomorphic to \( \boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p} \).
&lt;/think&gt;

To compute the equivalence classes of extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\), denoted as \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\), we consider both the group cohomology and homological algebra perspectives. 

1. **Abelian Extensions**: 
   - For abelian extensions, we use the Ext functor. Specifically, we need to compute \(\text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\).
   - Using the projective resolution of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\):
     \[
     0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{p} \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0
     \]
   - Applying \(\text{Hom}(-, \mathbb{Z})\) and considering the long exact sequence, we find:
     \[
     \text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_p
     \]
   - This result indicates that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\) are classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\).

2. **Group Cohomology**:
   - For non-abelian extensions, we consider group cohomology \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\). However, since \(\mathbb{Z}\) is a trivial \(\mathbb{Z}_p\)-module and \(\mathbb{Z}\) is torsion-free, the cohomology group \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) also leads to the same result for trivial actions.
   - For \(p = 2\), non-trivial actions (inversion) are possible, but they do not contribute additional equivalence classes as shown by cohomology calculations.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) of equivalence classes of extensions, whether considered as abelian extensions or group extensions with trivial action, is classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\). This structure holds for both odd and even primes \(p\).

Thus, the structure of the set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) is the cyclic group of order \(p\), leading to the final answer:

\[
\boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to compute the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ, denoted as E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and figure out the structure of this set. Hmm, extensions of groups, right? I remember that in group theory, an extension of a group Q by a group N is a group G such that N is a normal subgroup of G and G/N is isomorphic to Q. So in this case, we&#x27;re looking at extensions where the quotient group is ℤ_p and the normal subgroup is ℤ. 

First, let me recall the general theory of group extensions. Extensions are classified by the second cohomology group H²(Q, N), where the action of Q on N is given by some module structure. But here, both N and Q are abelian groups, so the extensions should also be abelian. Wait, is that right? If both groups are abelian, then the extension is also abelian if the action is trivial? Maybe I need to be careful here.

Let me double-check. For abelian extensions, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N is isomorphic to Ext¹(Q, N). But in general, group extensions (not necessarily abelian) are classified by H²(Q, N). But since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, maybe we&#x27;re dealing with abelian extensions here. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify whether the extensions are required to be abelian, but since both groups are abelian, it&#x27;s possible that we are considering central extensions, which would be classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But I need to verify this.

Wait, Ext¹ is for abelian extensions, right? Let me recall: For abelian groups, the Ext functor in homological algebra classifies extensions. Specifically, Ext¹(Q, N) corresponds to the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N. So if we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions, then we need to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). However, if we consider arbitrary group extensions, then it would be H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But since ℤ is a trivial ℤ_p-module in the case of group cohomology? Wait, but ℤ_p acts on ℤ? How?

Wait, in group cohomology, the coefficients have to be a module over the group. So ℤ here would need to be a ℤ_p-module. If the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) would classify central extensions. But ℤ_p is cyclic of order p, and ℤ is torsion-free. So maybe the only action possible is trivial. Because any automorphism of ℤ is multiplication by ±1, but since ℤ_p is a cyclic group of order p, the action has to satisfy that applying the automorphism p times is the identity. But if we have multiplication by -1, then applying it p times would be multiplication by (-1)^p. If p is odd, this is -1, which is not the identity. If p=2, then it&#x27;s 1. So for p=2, a nontrivial action is possible, but for odd p, only the trivial action is possible. Wait, so maybe for p=2, ℤ could have a nontrivial ℤ_2 module structure where the generator acts as multiplication by -1. But ℤ is written additively, so the action would be x ↦ -x. Then, applying it twice would give the identity, which works for ℤ_2.

But in the problem statement, are we considering arbitrary extensions, or central extensions? The notation E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a bit ambiguous. In the literature, sometimes E(G, A) denotes equivalence classes of extensions of G by A, which could be nonabelian. But given that both ℤ_p and ℤ are abelian, if we consider abelian extensions, then the extensions would also be abelian groups. Alternatively, if we allow nonabelian extensions, even with abelian kernel and quotient, the set might be larger. But in general, I think that when dealing with abelian groups, people often consider abelian extensions, so perhaps the question is about abelian extensions. Let me check.

If we are to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ), then since Ext¹ is the derived functor, we can compute it using a projective resolution of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s recall that ℤ_p is isomorphic to ℤ / pℤ. So we can take the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, where the first map is multiplication by p. Applying the functor Hom(-, ℤ), we get the long exact sequence:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ, ℤ) → ...

But Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) is 0 because ℤ is torsion-free and ℤ_p is torsion. Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is isomorphic to ℤ, generated by the identity map. The map Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is induced by multiplication by p, so it&#x27;s also multiplication by p in Hom(ℤ, ℤ) ≅ ℤ. Therefore, the kernel is 0 and the cokernel is ℤ / pℤ. Then, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Wait, so this would mean that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ are in bijection with ℤ_p. Each element of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) corresponds to an abelian extension. So the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. But what do these extensions look like?

An abelian extension would be an abelian group G with a subgroup isomorphic to ℤ such that the quotient is isomorphic to ℤ_p. Since G is abelian and ℤ is a free abelian group, any such extension must split, right? Wait, no. If the extension splits, then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, but ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, whereas ℤ is torsion-free. Wait, but ℤ_p has torsion. Wait, but G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, so there is an exact sequence 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If the extension splits, then G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free because it has elements of order p. But the image of ℤ in G is a normal subgroup (since G is abelian) and the quotient is ℤ_p. However, if the extension doesn&#x27;t split, then G would have to be torsion-free? Wait, but how?

Wait, if G is an abelian group containing ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G is generated by the elements of ℤ and a preimage of the generator of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s suppose that ℤ is generated by x, and the generator of ℤ_p is y + ℤ. Then in G, we have that p(y + ℤ) = 0, so py ∈ ℤ. Therefore, py = nx for some integer n. Therefore, G is generated by x and y with relation py = nx. So depending on n, we can get different extensions. However, since n is an integer, but we can adjust y by multiples of x, so different n&#x27;s can give equivalent extensions. Specifically, if we replace y by y + kx, then p(y + kx) = py + pkx = nx + pkx = (n + pk)x. Therefore, n is determined modulo pℤ. Hence, the equivalence classes are parameterized by ℤ_p. So each extension is determined by an integer n modulo p, which tells us how many times we &quot;twist&quot; the generator y around the subgroup ℤ. Therefore, the equivalence classes are in bijection with ℤ_p. 

But in the case when n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in G, but G is generated by x and y with py = 0. Wait, but x has infinite order, and y has order p. Then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, which is the split extension. For other values of n, we get non-split extensions. For example, take n=1. Then G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x = py, so G is generated by y, with the relation that p^2 y = 0? Wait, no, wait. If py = x, then x is in the subgroup generated by y. Therefore, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, since x and y are related by py = x. Then, the quotient G / ℤ would be generated by y + ℤ, and since py = x ∈ ℤ, we have p(y + ℤ) = 0 in G / ℤ. So G / ℤ is cyclic of order p. But G itself is generated by y, and since x = py, then G is isomorphic to ℤ via y ↦ 1. But then G / ℤ would be ℤ / pℤ, which is correct. Wait, but then G is just ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ? Wait, that can&#x27;t be. If G is ℤ, then the subgroup would have to be pℤ, and the quotient would be ℤ_p. But that&#x27;s exactly the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0 where the first map is multiplication by p. So in this case, the extension is equivalent to the trivial extension? Wait, no. Wait, if n=1, then the extension is 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, but this is not split. Because in this case, G is ℤ, which can&#x27;t be written as a direct product of ℤ and ℤ_p. 

Wait, but if we have G being ℤ with the subgroup pℤ, then G is indeed just ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. So this is a non-split extension. But if we take n=0, then the extension would be split: 0 → ℤ → ℤ × ℤ_p → ℤ_p → 0. So the equivalence classes of extensions are in correspondence with n mod p, which is ℤ_p. So Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) of equivalence classes of abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

But hold on, earlier I thought that G can be generated by y with relation p^2 y = 0 if n=1, but that&#x27;s not correct. Because if we set py = x, which is in ℤ, then x is a generator of ℤ. So G is actually generated by y, and x is just py. Therefore, G is still ℤ, with y being a generator. Then the subgroup ℤ inside G is generated by x = py. Therefore, G is isomorphic to ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ. So indeed, this is the extension where ℤ is included as pℤ inside ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ / pℤ = ℤ_p. So all these extensions are actually isomorphic to ℤ, but with different embeddings of the subgroup. Wait, but in the category of abelian groups, how do we consider equivalence of extensions? 

Two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s a commutative diagram:

0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0

  ↓      ↓       ↓

0 → ℤ → G&#x27; → ℤ_p → 0

With the middle arrow being an isomorphism. So even if G and G&#x27; are both isomorphic to ℤ, but the embeddings of ℤ are different, then the extensions might not be equivalent. For example, if we have two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is coprime to p, then these would be inequivalent extensions. Wait, but in our case, the embeddings are determined by n mod p. For each n mod p, the embedding is multiplication by n. But if n is invertible mod p, does that give a different embedding? Wait, but in the case of n=1, the embedding is pℤ, and if n is coprime to p, say n=2, then the embedding is 2pℤ? Wait, no. Wait, in the extension corresponding to n, the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, and we have py = nx. So if n is coprime to p, then x is a multiple of py. For example, if n=1, x = py. If n=2, x = py, so 2x = p(2y). But 2 is invertible mod p if p is odd, so 2y would generate the same subgroup as y. Wait, maybe this is getting confused. 

Alternatively, maybe all these extensions are isomorphic as groups, but the specific embeddings are different. However, in the category of abelian groups, the automorphisms of ℤ are limited to multiplication by ±1. So if two embeddings differ by a automorphism of ℤ, then the extensions are equivalent. So if the embedding is given by multiplication by n, then if we can find an automorphism of ℤ (i.e., multiplication by ±1) such that n is sent to another integer, but since n is mod p, we can adjust n by ±1. But actually, the equivalence classes are determined by the module structure, so maybe the parameter n is considered up to automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. 

Wait, but according to the calculation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) being ℤ_p, the equivalence classes are in one-to-one correspondence with ℤ_p. So even though all the middle groups G might be isomorphic to ℤ or ℤ × ℤ_p, the actual extensions are considered different if the embeddings or the projections are different. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which is not isomorphic to ℤ. But when we have non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So actually, how come some extensions have G ≅ ℤ and others G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p? 

Wait, no, actually, in the case of the non-split extensions, G is always ℤ. Because if you have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0, then G has to be torsion-free if it&#x27;s abelian, because ℤ is torsion-free. But ℤ × ℤ_p has torsion, so it can&#x27;t be torsion-free. Therefore, only the non-split extensions result in G being ℤ, and the split extension would have G as ℤ × ℤ_p, which is impossible because that&#x27;s not torsion-free. Wait, this is a contradiction. 

Hold on, maybe all abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ must have G torsion-free. Therefore, the only possible extension is the non-split one. But according to our earlier calculation, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which suggests there are multiple extensions. But how can there be multiple non-isomorphic extensions? 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let&#x27;s consider the extensions. If G is abelian, torsion-free, and contains ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G must be isomorphic to ℤ. Because the only torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are ℤ and subgroups of ℚ. But if G is finitely generated (which it is, since it&#x27;s an extension of finite cyclic group by ℤ), then it must be isomorphic to ℤ. So actually, all such extensions have G ≅ ℤ, but with different embeddings. But in the category of abelian groups, two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s an isomorphism between the middle groups compatible with the embeddings and projections. 

So for example, take two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is an integer. Then these would define different extensions if k is not ±1. But since in abelian groups, automorphisms of ℤ are only ±1, the different multiples would lead to inequivalent extensions. But in our case, the extensions are parameterized by n mod p, so n can be 0,1,...,p-1. However, if n is non-zero, then the embedding is multiplication by n, but since n is invertible mod p or not? 

Wait, if we have an extension determined by n, where py = nx. If n is coprime to p, then there exists an integer m such that mn ≡ 1 mod p. Then, m py = mn x, which implies p(my) = x. Therefore, replacing y by my, we get the relation p(my) = x. Therefore, the embedding is multiplication by 1. So in this case, if n is coprime to p, the extension is equivalent to the one with n=1. If n is not coprime to p, say n and p share a common divisor d &gt;1, but since p is prime, this implies that n is a multiple of p, so n ≡ 0 mod p. Then, the extension is split. 

But wait, n is an integer, and the extensions are parameterized by n mod p. So if n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in the quotient, so G is ℤ × ℤ_p. But G must be abelian, so the only split extension is ℤ × ℤ_p. But earlier, I thought that if n ≡ 0 mod p, then the extension is split. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, so how can it be an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ? Wait, the exact sequence is 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If G is ℤ × ℤ_p, then the kernel is ℤ, embedded as (1,0), and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G has torsion, which is allowed? Wait, but the quotient is ℤ_p, which is torsion. So G can have torsion. Wait, but if the kernel is ℤ, which is torsion-free, the quotient is torsion, so G can have torsion. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which has torsion. However, in the non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So how does this work?

Wait, if G is ℤ, then the kernel is pℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G is torsion-free. So depending on whether the extension is split or not, G can be either torsion-free or have torsion. So the split extension is G = ℤ × ℤ_p, and the non-split extensions are G = ℤ. But then, if n ≠ 0 mod p, the extension is non-split, and G is ℤ. But there is only one non-split extension? But Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which would suggest there are p different extensions. 

This is confusing. Let me think again. 

We have Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So there are p equivalence classes of extensions. But how do these correspond to different groups G? For each n ∈ ℤ_p, we have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If n=0, then G is the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p. For n ≠0, G is a non-split extension. But if G is non-split, is it always isomorphic to ℤ? 

Wait, no. Let&#x27;s consider n=1. The group G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x is in the center (since G is abelian), and y has the relation that py = x. Then, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, with y as the generator. Then x = py, so the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, which is pℤ inside G. Then, the quotient G / pℤ is ℤ_p. So G is ℤ, and the extension is 0 → pℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0. 

But for n=2, if p ≠2, then the extension would be generated by x and y with py = 2x. Then, similar to the above, if we let z = y - x, then pz = py - px = 2x - px = (2 - p)x. Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, since 2 is invertible mod p (if p≠2), then there exists an integer m such that 2m ≡1 mod p. Then, replacing y with my, we get p(my) = m py = m*2x = (2m)x ≡ x mod p. Therefore, this extension is equivalent to the n=1 case. 

Therefore, for n coprime to p, the extensions are equivalent to the n=1 case. If n is not coprime to p, i.e., n=0 mod p, then it&#x27;s the split extension. Wait, but p is prime, so every n ≠0 mod p is coprime to p. Therefore, all non-zero n mod p give equivalent extensions? But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p. 

Hmm, so there must be a mistake in my reasoning here. Let&#x27;s go back to the computation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). Using the projective resolution:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → ℤ_p → 0

Applying Hom(-, ℤ), we get:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) --p*--&gt; Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → 0

Since Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) =0, this reduces to:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) →0

So the cokernel of multiplication by p is ℤ_p, hence Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, there are p distinct extensions. But if all non-zero extensions are isomorphic, then Ext¹ would be trivial or have fewer elements. So my previous reasoning that all non-zero n give equivalent extensions must be wrong. 

Wait, perhaps when considering equivalence of extensions, the automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p have to be taken into account. So two extensions are equivalent if there is a commutative diagram with automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. The automorphism group of ℤ is ℤ× = {±1}, and the automorphism group of ℤ_p is (ℤ_p)×, which has order p-1. Therefore, when considering equivalence classes of extensions, we might have to mod out by the action of these automorphism groups. However, in the calculation of Ext¹, we are considering extensions up to equivalence where the automorphisms of the kernel and quotient are not factored out. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s can be related by automorphisms of ℤ_p, in the Ext¹ calculation, these are considered distinct. Wait, no. Actually, in the definition of Ext¹, two extensions are equivalent if there exists a morphism between them that is the identity on N and Q. So automorphisms of N and Q are not considered. Therefore, even if two extensions differ by an automorphism of N or Q, they are still considered distinct in Ext¹. Therefore, in our case, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is indeed ℤ_p, with each element corresponding to a different extension. 

Therefore, even though for different n coprime to p, the groups G might be isomorphic, the extensions themselves are different because the way ℤ is embedded and the way the quotient maps are defined are different. So even if two extensions have isomorphic middle groups, if the embeddings and projections are different, they are considered non-equivalent extensions. 

So for example, take p=3. Then we have three extensions: n=0,1,2. For n=0, G=ℤ × ℤ_3. For n=1, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. For n=2, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 6ℤ? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, then the relation is 3y = 2x. If x is the generator of ℤ, then solving for x, we get x = (3/2)y. But since x must be an integer multiple of y, this is only possible if y is even. Wait, this seems problematic. 

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of group presentations. For each n, the group G is generated by x and y with the relation that py = nx. So for n=1, G is generated by x and y with 3y = x. Then, x is redundant as a generator because x = 3y, so G is generated by y, which is infinite cyclic. Therefore, G ≅ ℤ, with the subgroup generated by x = 3y. 

For n=2, G is generated by x and y with 3y = 2x. Then, we can write x = (3/2)y. But x must be an integer multiple of y, so this would require that y is divisible by 2. Let me set y = 2z. Then, x = 3z. Therefore, G is generated by z, with no relations, so G ≅ ℤ. The subgroup generated by x is 3z, so ℤ is embedded as 3ℤ in G. Wait, but this is the same as the n=1 case. So in this case, even though n=2, the group G is still ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. Therefore, the extensions corresponding to n=1 and n=2 are isomorphic? 

But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So where is the error here? 

Ah, perhaps in the equivalence of extensions, the automorphism of ℤ_p comes into play. If we have two extensions where the only difference is an automorphism of ℤ_p, then they would be considered equivalent. For example, if n=2 in the case p=3, then the quotient map G → ℤ_3 sends y to 1 + 3ℤ. But if we compose this with the automorphism of ℤ_3 that multiplies by 2, then the quotient map becomes y ↦ 2 + 3ℤ. Then, the relation becomes 3y = 2x, but after the automorphism, it&#x27;s equivalent to 3y = x. Therefore, the extensions n=1 and n=2 are equivalent under the automorphism of ℤ_p. 

But in the definition of Ext¹, when we compute Ext¹(Q, N), we consider extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are the identity. Therefore, if we allow automorphisms of Q, then different extensions could become equivalent. However, in the standard definition, Ext¹(Q, N) classifies extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are identities. Therefore, in our case, the different n&#x27;s correspond to different extensions even if they are related by automorphisms of Q. 

But in the example above, with p=3, n=1 and n=2 would give extensions that are isomorphic as groups, but the specific quotient maps differ by an automorphism of ℤ_p. Therefore, if we consider extensions up to isomorphism of the groups G, then there are only two isomorphism classes: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p and the non-split extension ℤ. But according to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, there are p equivalence classes of extensions. Therefore, the distinction is in the specific way the quotient is taken and the subgroup is embedded, not just the isomorphism class of G. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s may lead to isomorphic middle groups G, the extensions themselves are different because the maps are different. Hence, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has p elements, corresponding to the p different extensions. The structure of this set is therefore a cyclic group of order p, i.e., ℤ_p. 

But wait, is the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) actually a group? In the context of abelian extensions, yes, the Baer sum gives an abelian group structure on E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and it is isomorphic to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has the structure of the group ℤ_p. 

Alternatively, if we consider non-abelian extensions, but since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, all extensions are abelian. Wait, is that true? Let me check. If G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, then G is necessarily abelian? 

Suppose G is a group with a normal subgroup N ≅ ℤ and G/N ≅ ℤ_p. Is G necessarily abelian? 

Take an element y ∈ G such that the image of y in G/N generates G/N. Then, since G/N has order p, we have y^p ∈ N. Also, since N is abelian, the commutator [y, x] for x ∈ N must lie in N. But N is central in G? Not necessarily. Wait, if N is central, then G is abelian. But if N is not central, then G could be non-abelian. 

But ℤ is a cyclic group, so its automorphism group is ℤ× ≅ {±1}. Therefore, the action of y on N by conjugation must be an automorphism of N. Let’s suppose that conjugation by y acts as multiplication by k on N ≅ ℤ. Then, since y^p ∈ N, we have y^p x y^{-p} = x. But y^p is in N, which is abelian, so conjugation by y^p is trivial. Therefore, the automorphism induced by y must satisfy that its order divides p. But the automorphism group of ℤ is {1, -1}, so the only possibilities are that conjugation by y acts trivially (k=1) or as inversion (k=-1). If p is odd, then inversion has order 2, which does not divide p, unless p=2. Therefore, for odd p, the action must be trivial, so G is abelian. For p=2, inversion has order 2, which divides p=2, so non-abelian extensions are possible. 

Therefore, for p odd, all extensions are abelian, and E(ℤ_p, ℤ) = Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there could be non-abelian extensions. But since the problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t specify whether they are abelian or not, we might need to consider both cases. However, in the case of abelian extensions, as I computed before, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For non-abelian extensions when p=2, let&#x27;s see. 

For p=2, we can have a non-abelian extension where the generator of ℤ_2 acts by inversion on ℤ. Then, G would be the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, where ℤ_2 acts by inversion. This is a non-abelian group. So in this case, E(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have both abelian and non-abelian extensions. However, the question is about equivalence classes of extensions. In the category of groups, extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ), where ℤ is a ℤ_p-module. For p=2, ℤ can be a non-trivial module, so H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have more elements. 

But let&#x27;s compute H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). For group cohomology, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / N(A), where N is the norm map. Wait, when the action is non-trivial, the cohomology groups can be different. Let me recall that for cyclic groups, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / (1 - γ)A, where γ is a generator of ℤ_p. But if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A / pA. But in our case, for p=2, the action could be non-trivial. Let me consider p=2 and ℤ as a ℤ_2-module with the generator acting as -1. Then, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would be computed as follows. 

The group ℤ_2 acts on ℤ by inversion. The cohomology H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) can be computed using the Tate cohomology, which for cyclic groups is H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / (1 + γ)ℤ. Here, γ is the generator of ℤ_2 acting as -1 on ℤ. The norm map is 1 + γ, which acts as 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / 0 = ℤ^{ℤ_2}. But ℤ^{ℤ_2} is the set of elements fixed by the ℤ_2 action. Since the action is inversion, the fixed points are {x ∈ ℤ | -x = x} = {0}. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. Wait, but that would mean there are no non-abelian extensions? But we know that the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian extension. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recall that for group cohomology, H²(G, A) classifies extensions of G by A that are compatible with the module structure. If A is a trivial G-module, then H²(G, A) classifies central extensions. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(G, A) classifies extensions where the conjugation action of G on A matches the module structure. 

In the case of the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, the action is non-trivial (inversion), so this corresponds to a non-trivial ℤ_2-module structure on ℤ. Therefore, the extension is classified by an element of H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. However, according to the calculation above, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group. 

Wait, but maybe I need to use the fact that ℤ is a torsion-free module. Let me check another approach. For a cyclic group G = ℤ_p, the cohomology groups can be computed using the resolution:

... → ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] --N--&gt; ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] → ℤ → 0

where γ is a generator of G, and N is the norm element 1 + γ + ... + γ^{p-1}.

Then, applying Hom(-, A), we get the cochain complex:

0 → Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --N*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; ...

For H²(G, A), we need the second cohomology, which is the kernel of (1-γ)* modulo the image of N*. 

But Hom(ℤ[G], A) ≅ A, since ℤ[G] is free abelian of rank 1. Therefore, the complex becomes:

0 → A --1-γ--&gt; A --N--&gt; A --1-γ--&gt; ...

So H²(G, A) is the kernel of 1 - γ : A → A modulo the image of N : A → A. 

For our case, G=ℤ_2 acting on ℤ by inversion. Then, 1 - γ acts as 1 - (-1) = 2 on ℤ. The norm map N is 1 + γ = 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of multiplication by 2 on ℤ modulo the image of 0, which is 2ℤ / 0 ≅ 2ℤ. But H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) should be a torsion group, but 2ℤ is torsion-free. This suggests something is wrong. 

Wait, perhaps in group cohomology with coefficients in a non-trivial module, H² can be torsion even if the coefficients are torsion-free. But here, the calculation seems to give 2ℤ, which is incorrect. There must be an error in the setup. 

Alternatively, maybe I should use the Tate cohomology. For finite cyclic groups, the Tate cohomology groups are periodic with period 2. But Tate cohomology is defined for finite groups and modules, and in this case, H^2 would be isomorphic to H^0, which for Tate cohomology is A^G / N(A). For our case, A=ℤ with γ acting as -1. Then A^G = {0}, and N(A) = 0, so H^0 = 0. Hence, H² would also be 0. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. 

But this contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group extension. Therefore, perhaps the infinite dihedral group is not a valid extension in this context? Wait, no, the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian group which is an extension of ℤ_2 by ℤ. However, the action is non-trivial, but if we consider the extension as one where the base group is ℤ and the quotient is ℤ_2, then the group is ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2. However, in this case, the ℤ_2 is acting on ℤ, so the module structure is non-trivial. Therefore, such an extension is classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to the cohomology calculation, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which would imply that there are no such extensions. But this is a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the confusion arises because ℤ is not a projective ℤ[G]-module when G acts non-trivially. In the case of the infinite dihedral group, the extension is split, so it corresponds to a semi-direct product, which is classified by a 1-cocycle in H¹(G, Aut(N)), not H². Wait, group extensions with non-abelian kernel are classified by H¹(G, Aut(N)), but in our case, N=ℤ is abelian, so Aut(N)=ℤ×. However, for non-abelian extensions, the action is given by a homomorphism from G to Aut(N), and the extensions are classified by H²(G, Z(N)), where Z(N) is the center. But since N=ℤ is abelian, Z(N)=N, so H²(G, N) classifies extensions with the given action. 

But in our case, if the action is non-trivial, then the extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to our previous calculation, this is 0. However, the infinite dihedral group exists. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation. 

Wait, actually, the infinite dihedral group is a split extension, so it corresponds to the zero element in H²(G, N). But if H²(G, N) is trivial, then all extensions are split. However, the infinite dihedral group is split, so that&#x27;s consistent. Therefore, if H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0 with the non-trivial action, then all extensions with that action are split. But in our case, the only extensions are the split ones. But the infinite dihedral group is indeed a split extension. 

But then, for the trivial action, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Wait, let me recast the problem. If we consider the trivial action, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Because in that case, 1 - γ is the zero map, and N is multiplication by 2. So H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of 0 modulo image of 2, which is ℤ / 2ℤ. Therefore, if the action is trivial, there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. But if the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, so only the split extension exists. 

But the infinite dihedral group is a split extension with the non-trivial action, so it corresponds to the trivial element in H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with non-trivial action. Therefore, if we consider the action as part of the data, then when the action is non-trivial, all extensions are split. When the action is trivial, there are two extensions. 

But in our original problem, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ), the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify the action, but in the case of group extensions, the action is part of the data. However, if we fix the action to be trivial, then for p=2, we have H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, leading to two extensions. But for odd p, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, leading to p extensions. But earlier, we saw that when considering abelian extensions, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. However, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) (for trivial action) is also ℤ_p. 

Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify. For abelian extensions, where the action is trivial, the extensions are classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For group extensions (possibly non-abelian), with trivial action, they are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. But when the action is non-trivial, for p=2, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) =0. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether we are considering the action as part of the data or not. The problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which usually means that ℤ is the kernel and ℤ_p is the quotient. The action is then determined by the conjugation in the group. For abelian extensions, the action must be trivial. For non-abelian extensions, the action can be non-trivial if possible. 

But since ℤ is abelian, the conjugation action of G on ℤ must be trivial on ℤ, so the action factors through G/ℤ ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the action is a homomorphism ℤ_p → Aut(ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2. For p odd, there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from ℤ_p to ℤ_2 since p is odd and ℤ_p has no elements of order 2. Therefore, for p odd, the action must be trivial, so all extensions are abelian and classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there is a non-trivial homomorphism from ℤ_2 to Aut(ℤ), given by inversion. Therefore, extensions can have either trivial or non-trivial action. 

For p=2, if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, so there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ)=0, so only the split extension exists (the infinite dihedral group). Therefore, the total number of extensions is three? Wait, no. When considering group extensions with a given module structure, the action is fixed. Therefore, if we fix the action to be trivial, then there are two extensions. If we fix the action to be non-trivial, there&#x27;s one extension. But in the problem statement, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) without specifying the action, which could mean considering all possible actions. 

But in the literature, when the action is not specified, it&#x27;s usually assumed to be trivial. Alternatively, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might consider all possible extensions with any possible action. In that case, for p=2, we have extensions with trivial action (two) and extensions with non-trivial action (one). But I need to confirm this. 

However, given that the problem mentions &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which is somewhat ambiguous, but in the context of abelian groups, it&#x27;s more likely referring to abelian extensions. Moreover, if the problem is from a course on homological algebra or algebraic topology, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might denote the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions, which would be Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Therefore, taking into account that for each prime p, whether p=2 or odd, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, the structure of E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a cyclic group of order p. Hence, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ is in bijection with ℤ_p, and as a group under the Baer sum, it is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

Therefore, the final answer is that the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is in bijection with ℤ_p, and its structure is that of the cyclic group of order p.

**Final Answer**
The set of equivalence classes of extensions is the cyclic group of order \( p \), so \( E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \) is isomorphic to \( \boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p} \).
&lt;/think&gt;

To compute the equivalence classes of extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\), denoted as \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\), we consider both the group cohomology and homological algebra perspectives. 

1. **Abelian Extensions**: 
   - For abelian extensions, we use the Ext functor. Specifically, we need to compute \(\text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\).
   - Using the projective resolution of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\):
     \[
     0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{p} \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0
     \]
   - Applying \(\text{Hom}(-, \mathbb{Z})\) and considering the long exact sequence, we find:
     \[
     \text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_p
     \]
   - This result indicates that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\) are classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\).

2. **Group Cohomology**:
   - For non-abelian extensions, we consider group cohomology \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\). However, since \(\mathbb{Z}\) is a trivial \(\mathbb{Z}_p\)-module and \(\mathbb{Z}\) is torsion-free, the cohomology group \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) also leads to the same result for trivial actions.
   - For \(p = 2\), non-trivial actions (inversion) are possible, but they do not contribute additional equivalence classes as shown by cohomology calculations.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) of equivalence classes of extensions, whether considered as abelian extensions or group extensions with trivial action, is classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\). This structure holds for both odd and even primes \(p\).

Thus, the structure of the set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) is the cyclic group of order \(p\), leading to the final answer:

\[
\boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to compute the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ, denoted as E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and figure out the structure of this set. Hmm, extensions of groups, right? I remember that in group theory, an extension of a group Q by a group N is a group G such that N is a normal subgroup of G and G/N is isomorphic to Q. So in this case, we&#x27;re looking at extensions where the quotient group is ℤ_p and the normal subgroup is ℤ. 

First, let me recall the general theory of group extensions. Extensions are classified by the second cohomology group H²(Q, N), where the action of Q on N is given by some module structure. But here, both N and Q are abelian groups, so the extensions should also be abelian. Wait, is that right? If both groups are abelian, then the extension is also abelian if the action is trivial? Maybe I need to be careful here.

Let me double-check. For abelian extensions, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N is isomorphic to Ext¹(Q, N). But in general, group extensions (not necessarily abelian) are classified by H²(Q, N). But since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, maybe we&#x27;re dealing with abelian extensions here. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify whether the extensions are required to be abelian, but since both groups are abelian, it&#x27;s possible that we are considering central extensions, which would be classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But I need to verify this.

Wait, Ext¹ is for abelian extensions, right? Let me recall: For abelian groups, the Ext functor in homological algebra classifies extensions. Specifically, Ext¹(Q, N) corresponds to the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N. So if we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions, then we need to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). However, if we consider arbitrary group extensions, then it would be H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But since ℤ is a trivial ℤ_p-module in the case of group cohomology? Wait, but ℤ_p acts on ℤ? How?

Wait, in group cohomology, the coefficients have to be a module over the group. So ℤ here would need to be a ℤ_p-module. If the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) would classify central extensions. But ℤ_p is cyclic of order p, and ℤ is torsion-free. So maybe the only action possible is trivial. Because any automorphism of ℤ is multiplication by ±1, but since ℤ_p is a cyclic group of order p, the action has to satisfy that applying the automorphism p times is the identity. But if we have multiplication by -1, then applying it p times would be multiplication by (-1)^p. If p is odd, this is -1, which is not the identity. If p=2, then it&#x27;s 1. So for p=2, a nontrivial action is possible, but for odd p, only the trivial action is possible. Wait, so maybe for p=2, ℤ could have a nontrivial ℤ_2 module structure where the generator acts as multiplication by -1. But ℤ is written additively, so the action would be x ↦ -x. Then, applying it twice would give the identity, which works for ℤ_2.

But in the problem statement, are we considering arbitrary extensions, or central extensions? The notation E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a bit ambiguous. In the literature, sometimes E(G, A) denotes equivalence classes of extensions of G by A, which could be nonabelian. But given that both ℤ_p and ℤ are abelian, if we consider abelian extensions, then the extensions would also be abelian groups. Alternatively, if we allow nonabelian extensions, even with abelian kernel and quotient, the set might be larger. But in general, I think that when dealing with abelian groups, people often consider abelian extensions, so perhaps the question is about abelian extensions. Let me check.

If we are to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ), then since Ext¹ is the derived functor, we can compute it using a projective resolution of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s recall that ℤ_p is isomorphic to ℤ / pℤ. So we can take the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, where the first map is multiplication by p. Applying the functor Hom(-, ℤ), we get the long exact sequence:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ, ℤ) → ...

But Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) is 0 because ℤ is torsion-free and ℤ_p is torsion. Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is isomorphic to ℤ, generated by the identity map. The map Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is induced by multiplication by p, so it&#x27;s also multiplication by p in Hom(ℤ, ℤ) ≅ ℤ. Therefore, the kernel is 0 and the cokernel is ℤ / pℤ. Then, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Wait, so this would mean that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ are in bijection with ℤ_p. Each element of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) corresponds to an abelian extension. So the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. But what do these extensions look like?

An abelian extension would be an abelian group G with a subgroup isomorphic to ℤ such that the quotient is isomorphic to ℤ_p. Since G is abelian and ℤ is a free abelian group, any such extension must split, right? Wait, no. If the extension splits, then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, but ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, whereas ℤ is torsion-free. Wait, but ℤ_p has torsion. Wait, but G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, so there is an exact sequence 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If the extension splits, then G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free because it has elements of order p. But the image of ℤ in G is a normal subgroup (since G is abelian) and the quotient is ℤ_p. However, if the extension doesn&#x27;t split, then G would have to be torsion-free? Wait, but how?

Wait, if G is an abelian group containing ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G is generated by the elements of ℤ and a preimage of the generator of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s suppose that ℤ is generated by x, and the generator of ℤ_p is y + ℤ. Then in G, we have that p(y + ℤ) = 0, so py ∈ ℤ. Therefore, py = nx for some integer n. Therefore, G is generated by x and y with relation py = nx. So depending on n, we can get different extensions. However, since n is an integer, but we can adjust y by multiples of x, so different n&#x27;s can give equivalent extensions. Specifically, if we replace y by y + kx, then p(y + kx) = py + pkx = nx + pkx = (n + pk)x. Therefore, n is determined modulo pℤ. Hence, the equivalence classes are parameterized by ℤ_p. So each extension is determined by an integer n modulo p, which tells us how many times we &quot;twist&quot; the generator y around the subgroup ℤ. Therefore, the equivalence classes are in bijection with ℤ_p. 

But in the case when n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in G, but G is generated by x and y with py = 0. Wait, but x has infinite order, and y has order p. Then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, which is the split extension. For other values of n, we get non-split extensions. For example, take n=1. Then G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x = py, so G is generated by y, with the relation that p^2 y = 0? Wait, no, wait. If py = x, then x is in the subgroup generated by y. Therefore, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, since x and y are related by py = x. Then, the quotient G / ℤ would be generated by y + ℤ, and since py = x ∈ ℤ, we have p(y + ℤ) = 0 in G / ℤ. So G / ℤ is cyclic of order p. But G itself is generated by y, and since x = py, then G is isomorphic to ℤ via y ↦ 1. But then G / ℤ would be ℤ / pℤ, which is correct. Wait, but then G is just ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ? Wait, that can&#x27;t be. If G is ℤ, then the subgroup would have to be pℤ, and the quotient would be ℤ_p. But that&#x27;s exactly the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0 where the first map is multiplication by p. So in this case, the extension is equivalent to the trivial extension? Wait, no. Wait, if n=1, then the extension is 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, but this is not split. Because in this case, G is ℤ, which can&#x27;t be written as a direct product of ℤ and ℤ_p. 

Wait, but if we have G being ℤ with the subgroup pℤ, then G is indeed just ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. So this is a non-split extension. But if we take n=0, then the extension would be split: 0 → ℤ → ℤ × ℤ_p → ℤ_p → 0. So the equivalence classes of extensions are in correspondence with n mod p, which is ℤ_p. So Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) of equivalence classes of abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

But hold on, earlier I thought that G can be generated by y with relation p^2 y = 0 if n=1, but that&#x27;s not correct. Because if we set py = x, which is in ℤ, then x is a generator of ℤ. So G is actually generated by y, and x is just py. Therefore, G is still ℤ, with y being a generator. Then the subgroup ℤ inside G is generated by x = py. Therefore, G is isomorphic to ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ. So indeed, this is the extension where ℤ is included as pℤ inside ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ / pℤ = ℤ_p. So all these extensions are actually isomorphic to ℤ, but with different embeddings of the subgroup. Wait, but in the category of abelian groups, how do we consider equivalence of extensions? 

Two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s a commutative diagram:

0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0

  ↓      ↓       ↓

0 → ℤ → G&#x27; → ℤ_p → 0

With the middle arrow being an isomorphism. So even if G and G&#x27; are both isomorphic to ℤ, but the embeddings of ℤ are different, then the extensions might not be equivalent. For example, if we have two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is coprime to p, then these would be inequivalent extensions. Wait, but in our case, the embeddings are determined by n mod p. For each n mod p, the embedding is multiplication by n. But if n is invertible mod p, does that give a different embedding? Wait, but in the case of n=1, the embedding is pℤ, and if n is coprime to p, say n=2, then the embedding is 2pℤ? Wait, no. Wait, in the extension corresponding to n, the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, and we have py = nx. So if n is coprime to p, then x is a multiple of py. For example, if n=1, x = py. If n=2, x = py, so 2x = p(2y). But 2 is invertible mod p if p is odd, so 2y would generate the same subgroup as y. Wait, maybe this is getting confused. 

Alternatively, maybe all these extensions are isomorphic as groups, but the specific embeddings are different. However, in the category of abelian groups, the automorphisms of ℤ are limited to multiplication by ±1. So if two embeddings differ by a automorphism of ℤ, then the extensions are equivalent. So if the embedding is given by multiplication by n, then if we can find an automorphism of ℤ (i.e., multiplication by ±1) such that n is sent to another integer, but since n is mod p, we can adjust n by ±1. But actually, the equivalence classes are determined by the module structure, so maybe the parameter n is considered up to automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. 

Wait, but according to the calculation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) being ℤ_p, the equivalence classes are in one-to-one correspondence with ℤ_p. So even though all the middle groups G might be isomorphic to ℤ or ℤ × ℤ_p, the actual extensions are considered different if the embeddings or the projections are different. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which is not isomorphic to ℤ. But when we have non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So actually, how come some extensions have G ≅ ℤ and others G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p? 

Wait, no, actually, in the case of the non-split extensions, G is always ℤ. Because if you have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0, then G has to be torsion-free if it&#x27;s abelian, because ℤ is torsion-free. But ℤ × ℤ_p has torsion, so it can&#x27;t be torsion-free. Therefore, only the non-split extensions result in G being ℤ, and the split extension would have G as ℤ × ℤ_p, which is impossible because that&#x27;s not torsion-free. Wait, this is a contradiction. 

Hold on, maybe all abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ must have G torsion-free. Therefore, the only possible extension is the non-split one. But according to our earlier calculation, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which suggests there are multiple extensions. But how can there be multiple non-isomorphic extensions? 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let&#x27;s consider the extensions. If G is abelian, torsion-free, and contains ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G must be isomorphic to ℤ. Because the only torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are ℤ and subgroups of ℚ. But if G is finitely generated (which it is, since it&#x27;s an extension of finite cyclic group by ℤ), then it must be isomorphic to ℤ. So actually, all such extensions have G ≅ ℤ, but with different embeddings. But in the category of abelian groups, two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s an isomorphism between the middle groups compatible with the embeddings and projections. 

So for example, take two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is an integer. Then these would define different extensions if k is not ±1. But since in abelian groups, automorphisms of ℤ are only ±1, the different multiples would lead to inequivalent extensions. But in our case, the extensions are parameterized by n mod p, so n can be 0,1,...,p-1. However, if n is non-zero, then the embedding is multiplication by n, but since n is invertible mod p or not? 

Wait, if we have an extension determined by n, where py = nx. If n is coprime to p, then there exists an integer m such that mn ≡ 1 mod p. Then, m py = mn x, which implies p(my) = x. Therefore, replacing y by my, we get the relation p(my) = x. Therefore, the embedding is multiplication by 1. So in this case, if n is coprime to p, the extension is equivalent to the one with n=1. If n is not coprime to p, say n and p share a common divisor d &gt;1, but since p is prime, this implies that n is a multiple of p, so n ≡ 0 mod p. Then, the extension is split. 

But wait, n is an integer, and the extensions are parameterized by n mod p. So if n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in the quotient, so G is ℤ × ℤ_p. But G must be abelian, so the only split extension is ℤ × ℤ_p. But earlier, I thought that if n ≡ 0 mod p, then the extension is split. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, so how can it be an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ? Wait, the exact sequence is 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If G is ℤ × ℤ_p, then the kernel is ℤ, embedded as (1,0), and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G has torsion, which is allowed? Wait, but the quotient is ℤ_p, which is torsion. So G can have torsion. Wait, but if the kernel is ℤ, which is torsion-free, the quotient is torsion, so G can have torsion. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which has torsion. However, in the non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So how does this work?

Wait, if G is ℤ, then the kernel is pℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G is torsion-free. So depending on whether the extension is split or not, G can be either torsion-free or have torsion. So the split extension is G = ℤ × ℤ_p, and the non-split extensions are G = ℤ. But then, if n ≠ 0 mod p, the extension is non-split, and G is ℤ. But there is only one non-split extension? But Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which would suggest there are p different extensions. 

This is confusing. Let me think again. 

We have Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So there are p equivalence classes of extensions. But how do these correspond to different groups G? For each n ∈ ℤ_p, we have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If n=0, then G is the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p. For n ≠0, G is a non-split extension. But if G is non-split, is it always isomorphic to ℤ? 

Wait, no. Let&#x27;s consider n=1. The group G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x is in the center (since G is abelian), and y has the relation that py = x. Then, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, with y as the generator. Then x = py, so the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, which is pℤ inside G. Then, the quotient G / pℤ is ℤ_p. So G is ℤ, and the extension is 0 → pℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0. 

But for n=2, if p ≠2, then the extension would be generated by x and y with py = 2x. Then, similar to the above, if we let z = y - x, then pz = py - px = 2x - px = (2 - p)x. Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, since 2 is invertible mod p (if p≠2), then there exists an integer m such that 2m ≡1 mod p. Then, replacing y with my, we get p(my) = m py = m*2x = (2m)x ≡ x mod p. Therefore, this extension is equivalent to the n=1 case. 

Therefore, for n coprime to p, the extensions are equivalent to the n=1 case. If n is not coprime to p, i.e., n=0 mod p, then it&#x27;s the split extension. Wait, but p is prime, so every n ≠0 mod p is coprime to p. Therefore, all non-zero n mod p give equivalent extensions? But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p. 

Hmm, so there must be a mistake in my reasoning here. Let&#x27;s go back to the computation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). Using the projective resolution:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → ℤ_p → 0

Applying Hom(-, ℤ), we get:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) --p*--&gt; Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → 0

Since Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) =0, this reduces to:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) →0

So the cokernel of multiplication by p is ℤ_p, hence Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, there are p distinct extensions. But if all non-zero extensions are isomorphic, then Ext¹ would be trivial or have fewer elements. So my previous reasoning that all non-zero n give equivalent extensions must be wrong. 

Wait, perhaps when considering equivalence of extensions, the automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p have to be taken into account. So two extensions are equivalent if there is a commutative diagram with automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. The automorphism group of ℤ is ℤ× = {±1}, and the automorphism group of ℤ_p is (ℤ_p)×, which has order p-1. Therefore, when considering equivalence classes of extensions, we might have to mod out by the action of these automorphism groups. However, in the calculation of Ext¹, we are considering extensions up to equivalence where the automorphisms of the kernel and quotient are not factored out. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s can be related by automorphisms of ℤ_p, in the Ext¹ calculation, these are considered distinct. Wait, no. Actually, in the definition of Ext¹, two extensions are equivalent if there exists a morphism between them that is the identity on N and Q. So automorphisms of N and Q are not considered. Therefore, even if two extensions differ by an automorphism of N or Q, they are still considered distinct in Ext¹. Therefore, in our case, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is indeed ℤ_p, with each element corresponding to a different extension. 

Therefore, even though for different n coprime to p, the groups G might be isomorphic, the extensions themselves are different because the way ℤ is embedded and the way the quotient maps are defined are different. So even if two extensions have isomorphic middle groups, if the embeddings and projections are different, they are considered non-equivalent extensions. 

So for example, take p=3. Then we have three extensions: n=0,1,2. For n=0, G=ℤ × ℤ_3. For n=1, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. For n=2, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 6ℤ? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, then the relation is 3y = 2x. If x is the generator of ℤ, then solving for x, we get x = (3/2)y. But since x must be an integer multiple of y, this is only possible if y is even. Wait, this seems problematic. 

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of group presentations. For each n, the group G is generated by x and y with the relation that py = nx. So for n=1, G is generated by x and y with 3y = x. Then, x is redundant as a generator because x = 3y, so G is generated by y, which is infinite cyclic. Therefore, G ≅ ℤ, with the subgroup generated by x = 3y. 

For n=2, G is generated by x and y with 3y = 2x. Then, we can write x = (3/2)y. But x must be an integer multiple of y, so this would require that y is divisible by 2. Let me set y = 2z. Then, x = 3z. Therefore, G is generated by z, with no relations, so G ≅ ℤ. The subgroup generated by x is 3z, so ℤ is embedded as 3ℤ in G. Wait, but this is the same as the n=1 case. So in this case, even though n=2, the group G is still ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. Therefore, the extensions corresponding to n=1 and n=2 are isomorphic? 

But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So where is the error here? 

Ah, perhaps in the equivalence of extensions, the automorphism of ℤ_p comes into play. If we have two extensions where the only difference is an automorphism of ℤ_p, then they would be considered equivalent. For example, if n=2 in the case p=3, then the quotient map G → ℤ_3 sends y to 1 + 3ℤ. But if we compose this with the automorphism of ℤ_3 that multiplies by 2, then the quotient map becomes y ↦ 2 + 3ℤ. Then, the relation becomes 3y = 2x, but after the automorphism, it&#x27;s equivalent to 3y = x. Therefore, the extensions n=1 and n=2 are equivalent under the automorphism of ℤ_p. 

But in the definition of Ext¹, when we compute Ext¹(Q, N), we consider extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are the identity. Therefore, if we allow automorphisms of Q, then different extensions could become equivalent. However, in the standard definition, Ext¹(Q, N) classifies extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are identities. Therefore, in our case, the different n&#x27;s correspond to different extensions even if they are related by automorphisms of Q. 

But in the example above, with p=3, n=1 and n=2 would give extensions that are isomorphic as groups, but the specific quotient maps differ by an automorphism of ℤ_p. Therefore, if we consider extensions up to isomorphism of the groups G, then there are only two isomorphism classes: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p and the non-split extension ℤ. But according to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, there are p equivalence classes of extensions. Therefore, the distinction is in the specific way the quotient is taken and the subgroup is embedded, not just the isomorphism class of G. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s may lead to isomorphic middle groups G, the extensions themselves are different because the maps are different. Hence, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has p elements, corresponding to the p different extensions. The structure of this set is therefore a cyclic group of order p, i.e., ℤ_p. 

But wait, is the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) actually a group? In the context of abelian extensions, yes, the Baer sum gives an abelian group structure on E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and it is isomorphic to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has the structure of the group ℤ_p. 

Alternatively, if we consider non-abelian extensions, but since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, all extensions are abelian. Wait, is that true? Let me check. If G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, then G is necessarily abelian? 

Suppose G is a group with a normal subgroup N ≅ ℤ and G/N ≅ ℤ_p. Is G necessarily abelian? 

Take an element y ∈ G such that the image of y in G/N generates G/N. Then, since G/N has order p, we have y^p ∈ N. Also, since N is abelian, the commutator [y, x] for x ∈ N must lie in N. But N is central in G? Not necessarily. Wait, if N is central, then G is abelian. But if N is not central, then G could be non-abelian. 

But ℤ is a cyclic group, so its automorphism group is ℤ× ≅ {±1}. Therefore, the action of y on N by conjugation must be an automorphism of N. Let’s suppose that conjugation by y acts as multiplication by k on N ≅ ℤ. Then, since y^p ∈ N, we have y^p x y^{-p} = x. But y^p is in N, which is abelian, so conjugation by y^p is trivial. Therefore, the automorphism induced by y must satisfy that its order divides p. But the automorphism group of ℤ is {1, -1}, so the only possibilities are that conjugation by y acts trivially (k=1) or as inversion (k=-1). If p is odd, then inversion has order 2, which does not divide p, unless p=2. Therefore, for odd p, the action must be trivial, so G is abelian. For p=2, inversion has order 2, which divides p=2, so non-abelian extensions are possible. 

Therefore, for p odd, all extensions are abelian, and E(ℤ_p, ℤ) = Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there could be non-abelian extensions. But since the problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t specify whether they are abelian or not, we might need to consider both cases. However, in the case of abelian extensions, as I computed before, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For non-abelian extensions when p=2, let&#x27;s see. 

For p=2, we can have a non-abelian extension where the generator of ℤ_2 acts by inversion on ℤ. Then, G would be the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, where ℤ_2 acts by inversion. This is a non-abelian group. So in this case, E(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have both abelian and non-abelian extensions. However, the question is about equivalence classes of extensions. In the category of groups, extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ), where ℤ is a ℤ_p-module. For p=2, ℤ can be a non-trivial module, so H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have more elements. 

But let&#x27;s compute H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). For group cohomology, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / N(A), where N is the norm map. Wait, when the action is non-trivial, the cohomology groups can be different. Let me recall that for cyclic groups, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / (1 - γ)A, where γ is a generator of ℤ_p. But if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A / pA. But in our case, for p=2, the action could be non-trivial. Let me consider p=2 and ℤ as a ℤ_2-module with the generator acting as -1. Then, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would be computed as follows. 

The group ℤ_2 acts on ℤ by inversion. The cohomology H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) can be computed using the Tate cohomology, which for cyclic groups is H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / (1 + γ)ℤ. Here, γ is the generator of ℤ_2 acting as -1 on ℤ. The norm map is 1 + γ, which acts as 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / 0 = ℤ^{ℤ_2}. But ℤ^{ℤ_2} is the set of elements fixed by the ℤ_2 action. Since the action is inversion, the fixed points are {x ∈ ℤ | -x = x} = {0}. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. Wait, but that would mean there are no non-abelian extensions? But we know that the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian extension. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recall that for group cohomology, H²(G, A) classifies extensions of G by A that are compatible with the module structure. If A is a trivial G-module, then H²(G, A) classifies central extensions. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(G, A) classifies extensions where the conjugation action of G on A matches the module structure. 

In the case of the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, the action is non-trivial (inversion), so this corresponds to a non-trivial ℤ_2-module structure on ℤ. Therefore, the extension is classified by an element of H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. However, according to the calculation above, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group. 

Wait, but maybe I need to use the fact that ℤ is a torsion-free module. Let me check another approach. For a cyclic group G = ℤ_p, the cohomology groups can be computed using the resolution:

... → ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] --N--&gt; ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] → ℤ → 0

where γ is a generator of G, and N is the norm element 1 + γ + ... + γ^{p-1}.

Then, applying Hom(-, A), we get the cochain complex:

0 → Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --N*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; ...

For H²(G, A), we need the second cohomology, which is the kernel of (1-γ)* modulo the image of N*. 

But Hom(ℤ[G], A) ≅ A, since ℤ[G] is free abelian of rank 1. Therefore, the complex becomes:

0 → A --1-γ--&gt; A --N--&gt; A --1-γ--&gt; ...

So H²(G, A) is the kernel of 1 - γ : A → A modulo the image of N : A → A. 

For our case, G=ℤ_2 acting on ℤ by inversion. Then, 1 - γ acts as 1 - (-1) = 2 on ℤ. The norm map N is 1 + γ = 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of multiplication by 2 on ℤ modulo the image of 0, which is 2ℤ / 0 ≅ 2ℤ. But H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) should be a torsion group, but 2ℤ is torsion-free. This suggests something is wrong. 

Wait, perhaps in group cohomology with coefficients in a non-trivial module, H² can be torsion even if the coefficients are torsion-free. But here, the calculation seems to give 2ℤ, which is incorrect. There must be an error in the setup. 

Alternatively, maybe I should use the Tate cohomology. For finite cyclic groups, the Tate cohomology groups are periodic with period 2. But Tate cohomology is defined for finite groups and modules, and in this case, H^2 would be isomorphic to H^0, which for Tate cohomology is A^G / N(A). For our case, A=ℤ with γ acting as -1. Then A^G = {0}, and N(A) = 0, so H^0 = 0. Hence, H² would also be 0. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. 

But this contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group extension. Therefore, perhaps the infinite dihedral group is not a valid extension in this context? Wait, no, the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian group which is an extension of ℤ_2 by ℤ. However, the action is non-trivial, but if we consider the extension as one where the base group is ℤ and the quotient is ℤ_2, then the group is ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2. However, in this case, the ℤ_2 is acting on ℤ, so the module structure is non-trivial. Therefore, such an extension is classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to the cohomology calculation, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which would imply that there are no such extensions. But this is a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the confusion arises because ℤ is not a projective ℤ[G]-module when G acts non-trivially. In the case of the infinite dihedral group, the extension is split, so it corresponds to a semi-direct product, which is classified by a 1-cocycle in H¹(G, Aut(N)), not H². Wait, group extensions with non-abelian kernel are classified by H¹(G, Aut(N)), but in our case, N=ℤ is abelian, so Aut(N)=ℤ×. However, for non-abelian extensions, the action is given by a homomorphism from G to Aut(N), and the extensions are classified by H²(G, Z(N)), where Z(N) is the center. But since N=ℤ is abelian, Z(N)=N, so H²(G, N) classifies extensions with the given action. 

But in our case, if the action is non-trivial, then the extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to our previous calculation, this is 0. However, the infinite dihedral group exists. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation. 

Wait, actually, the infinite dihedral group is a split extension, so it corresponds to the zero element in H²(G, N). But if H²(G, N) is trivial, then all extensions are split. However, the infinite dihedral group is split, so that&#x27;s consistent. Therefore, if H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0 with the non-trivial action, then all extensions with that action are split. But in our case, the only extensions are the split ones. But the infinite dihedral group is indeed a split extension. 

But then, for the trivial action, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Wait, let me recast the problem. If we consider the trivial action, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Because in that case, 1 - γ is the zero map, and N is multiplication by 2. So H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of 0 modulo image of 2, which is ℤ / 2ℤ. Therefore, if the action is trivial, there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. But if the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, so only the split extension exists. 

But the infinite dihedral group is a split extension with the non-trivial action, so it corresponds to the trivial element in H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with non-trivial action. Therefore, if we consider the action as part of the data, then when the action is non-trivial, all extensions are split. When the action is trivial, there are two extensions. 

But in our original problem, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ), the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify the action, but in the case of group extensions, the action is part of the data. However, if we fix the action to be trivial, then for p=2, we have H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, leading to two extensions. But for odd p, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, leading to p extensions. But earlier, we saw that when considering abelian extensions, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. However, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) (for trivial action) is also ℤ_p. 

Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify. For abelian extensions, where the action is trivial, the extensions are classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For group extensions (possibly non-abelian), with trivial action, they are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. But when the action is non-trivial, for p=2, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) =0. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether we are considering the action as part of the data or not. The problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which usually means that ℤ is the kernel and ℤ_p is the quotient. The action is then determined by the conjugation in the group. For abelian extensions, the action must be trivial. For non-abelian extensions, the action can be non-trivial if possible. 

But since ℤ is abelian, the conjugation action of G on ℤ must be trivial on ℤ, so the action factors through G/ℤ ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the action is a homomorphism ℤ_p → Aut(ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2. For p odd, there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from ℤ_p to ℤ_2 since p is odd and ℤ_p has no elements of order 2. Therefore, for p odd, the action must be trivial, so all extensions are abelian and classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there is a non-trivial homomorphism from ℤ_2 to Aut(ℤ), given by inversion. Therefore, extensions can have either trivial or non-trivial action. 

For p=2, if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, so there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ)=0, so only the split extension exists (the infinite dihedral group). Therefore, the total number of extensions is three? Wait, no. When considering group extensions with a given module structure, the action is fixed. Therefore, if we fix the action to be trivial, then there are two extensions. If we fix the action to be non-trivial, there&#x27;s one extension. But in the problem statement, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) without specifying the action, which could mean considering all possible actions. 

But in the literature, when the action is not specified, it&#x27;s usually assumed to be trivial. Alternatively, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might consider all possible extensions with any possible action. In that case, for p=2, we have extensions with trivial action (two) and extensions with non-trivial action (one). But I need to confirm this. 

However, given that the problem mentions &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which is somewhat ambiguous, but in the context of abelian groups, it&#x27;s more likely referring to abelian extensions. Moreover, if the problem is from a course on homological algebra or algebraic topology, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might denote the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions, which would be Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Therefore, taking into account that for each prime p, whether p=2 or odd, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, the structure of E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a cyclic group of order p. Hence, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ is in bijection with ℤ_p, and as a group under the Baer sum, it is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

Therefore, the final answer is that the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is in bijection with ℤ_p, and its structure is that of the cyclic group of order p.

**Final Answer**
The set of equivalence classes of extensions is the cyclic group of order \( p \), so \( E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \) is isomorphic to \( \boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p} \).
&lt;/think&gt;

To compute the equivalence classes of extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\), denoted as \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\), we consider both the group cohomology and homological algebra perspectives. 

1. **Abelian Extensions**: 
   - For abelian extensions, we use the Ext functor. Specifically, we need to compute \(\text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\).
   - Using the projective resolution of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\):
     \[
     0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{p} \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0
     \]
   - Applying \(\text{Hom}(-, \mathbb{Z})\) and considering the long exact sequence, we find:
     \[
     \text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_p
     \]
   - This result indicates that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\) are classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\).

2. **Group Cohomology**:
   - For non-abelian extensions, we consider group cohomology \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\). However, since \(\mathbb{Z}\) is a trivial \(\mathbb{Z}_p\)-module and \(\mathbb{Z}\) is torsion-free, the cohomology group \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) also leads to the same result for trivial actions.
   - For \(p = 2\), non-trivial actions (inversion) are possible, but they do not contribute additional equivalence classes as shown by cohomology calculations.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) of equivalence classes of extensions, whether considered as abelian extensions or group extensions with trivial action, is classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\). This structure holds for both odd and even primes \(p\).

Thus, the structure of the set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) is the cyclic group of order \(p\), leading to the final answer:

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to compute the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ, denoted as E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and figure out the structure of this set. Hmm, extensions of groups, right? I remember that in group theory, an extension of a group Q by a group N is a group G such that N is a normal subgroup of G and G/N is isomorphic to Q. So in this case, we&#x27;re looking at extensions where the quotient group is ℤ_p and the normal subgroup is ℤ. 

First, let me recall the general theory of group extensions. Extensions are classified by the second cohomology group H²(Q, N), where the action of Q on N is given by some module structure. But here, both N and Q are abelian groups, so the extensions should also be abelian. Wait, is that right? If both groups are abelian, then the extension is also abelian if the action is trivial? Maybe I need to be careful here.

Let me double-check. For abelian extensions, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N is isomorphic to Ext¹(Q, N). But in general, group extensions (not necessarily abelian) are classified by H²(Q, N). But since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, maybe we&#x27;re dealing with abelian extensions here. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify whether the extensions are required to be abelian, but since both groups are abelian, it&#x27;s possible that we are considering central extensions, which would be classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But I need to verify this.

Wait, Ext¹ is for abelian extensions, right? Let me recall: For abelian groups, the Ext functor in homological algebra classifies extensions. Specifically, Ext¹(Q, N) corresponds to the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N. So if we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions, then we need to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). However, if we consider arbitrary group extensions, then it would be H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But since ℤ is a trivial ℤ_p-module in the case of group cohomology? Wait, but ℤ_p acts on ℤ? How?

Wait, in group cohomology, the coefficients have to be a module over the group. So ℤ here would need to be a ℤ_p-module. If the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) would classify central extensions. But ℤ_p is cyclic of order p, and ℤ is torsion-free. So maybe the only action possible is trivial. Because any automorphism of ℤ is multiplication by ±1, but since ℤ_p is a cyclic group of order p, the action has to satisfy that applying the automorphism p times is the identity. But if we have multiplication by -1, then applying it p times would be multiplication by (-1)^p. If p is odd, this is -1, which is not the identity. If p=2, then it&#x27;s 1. So for p=2, a nontrivial action is possible, but for odd p, only the trivial action is possible. Wait, so maybe for p=2, ℤ could have a nontrivial ℤ_2 module structure where the generator acts as multiplication by -1. But ℤ is written additively, so the action would be x ↦ -x. Then, applying it twice would give the identity, which works for ℤ_2.

But in the problem statement, are we considering arbitrary extensions, or central extensions? The notation E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a bit ambiguous. In the literature, sometimes E(G, A) denotes equivalence classes of extensions of G by A, which could be nonabelian. But given that both ℤ_p and ℤ are abelian, if we consider abelian extensions, then the extensions would also be abelian groups. Alternatively, if we allow nonabelian extensions, even with abelian kernel and quotient, the set might be larger. But in general, I think that when dealing with abelian groups, people often consider abelian extensions, so perhaps the question is about abelian extensions. Let me check.

If we are to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ), then since Ext¹ is the derived functor, we can compute it using a projective resolution of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s recall that ℤ_p is isomorphic to ℤ / pℤ. So we can take the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, where the first map is multiplication by p. Applying the functor Hom(-, ℤ), we get the long exact sequence:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ, ℤ) → ...

But Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) is 0 because ℤ is torsion-free and ℤ_p is torsion. Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is isomorphic to ℤ, generated by the identity map. The map Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is induced by multiplication by p, so it&#x27;s also multiplication by p in Hom(ℤ, ℤ) ≅ ℤ. Therefore, the kernel is 0 and the cokernel is ℤ / pℤ. Then, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Wait, so this would mean that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ are in bijection with ℤ_p. Each element of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) corresponds to an abelian extension. So the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. But what do these extensions look like?

An abelian extension would be an abelian group G with a subgroup isomorphic to ℤ such that the quotient is isomorphic to ℤ_p. Since G is abelian and ℤ is a free abelian group, any such extension must split, right? Wait, no. If the extension splits, then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, but ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, whereas ℤ is torsion-free. Wait, but ℤ_p has torsion. Wait, but G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, so there is an exact sequence 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If the extension splits, then G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free because it has elements of order p. But the image of ℤ in G is a normal subgroup (since G is abelian) and the quotient is ℤ_p. However, if the extension doesn&#x27;t split, then G would have to be torsion-free? Wait, but how?

Wait, if G is an abelian group containing ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G is generated by the elements of ℤ and a preimage of the generator of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s suppose that ℤ is generated by x, and the generator of ℤ_p is y + ℤ. Then in G, we have that p(y + ℤ) = 0, so py ∈ ℤ. Therefore, py = nx for some integer n. Therefore, G is generated by x and y with relation py = nx. So depending on n, we can get different extensions. However, since n is an integer, but we can adjust y by multiples of x, so different n&#x27;s can give equivalent extensions. Specifically, if we replace y by y + kx, then p(y + kx) = py + pkx = nx + pkx = (n + pk)x. Therefore, n is determined modulo pℤ. Hence, the equivalence classes are parameterized by ℤ_p. So each extension is determined by an integer n modulo p, which tells us how many times we &quot;twist&quot; the generator y around the subgroup ℤ. Therefore, the equivalence classes are in bijection with ℤ_p. 

But in the case when n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in G, but G is generated by x and y with py = 0. Wait, but x has infinite order, and y has order p. Then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, which is the split extension. For other values of n, we get non-split extensions. For example, take n=1. Then G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x = py, so G is generated by y, with the relation that p^2 y = 0? Wait, no, wait. If py = x, then x is in the subgroup generated by y. Therefore, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, since x and y are related by py = x. Then, the quotient G / ℤ would be generated by y + ℤ, and since py = x ∈ ℤ, we have p(y + ℤ) = 0 in G / ℤ. So G / ℤ is cyclic of order p. But G itself is generated by y, and since x = py, then G is isomorphic to ℤ via y ↦ 1. But then G / ℤ would be ℤ / pℤ, which is correct. Wait, but then G is just ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ? Wait, that can&#x27;t be. If G is ℤ, then the subgroup would have to be pℤ, and the quotient would be ℤ_p. But that&#x27;s exactly the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0 where the first map is multiplication by p. So in this case, the extension is equivalent to the trivial extension? Wait, no. Wait, if n=1, then the extension is 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, but this is not split. Because in this case, G is ℤ, which can&#x27;t be written as a direct product of ℤ and ℤ_p. 

Wait, but if we have G being ℤ with the subgroup pℤ, then G is indeed just ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. So this is a non-split extension. But if we take n=0, then the extension would be split: 0 → ℤ → ℤ × ℤ_p → ℤ_p → 0. So the equivalence classes of extensions are in correspondence with n mod p, which is ℤ_p. So Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) of equivalence classes of abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

But hold on, earlier I thought that G can be generated by y with relation p^2 y = 0 if n=1, but that&#x27;s not correct. Because if we set py = x, which is in ℤ, then x is a generator of ℤ. So G is actually generated by y, and x is just py. Therefore, G is still ℤ, with y being a generator. Then the subgroup ℤ inside G is generated by x = py. Therefore, G is isomorphic to ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ. So indeed, this is the extension where ℤ is included as pℤ inside ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ / pℤ = ℤ_p. So all these extensions are actually isomorphic to ℤ, but with different embeddings of the subgroup. Wait, but in the category of abelian groups, how do we consider equivalence of extensions? 

Two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s a commutative diagram:

0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0

  ↓      ↓       ↓

0 → ℤ → G&#x27; → ℤ_p → 0

With the middle arrow being an isomorphism. So even if G and G&#x27; are both isomorphic to ℤ, but the embeddings of ℤ are different, then the extensions might not be equivalent. For example, if we have two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is coprime to p, then these would be inequivalent extensions. Wait, but in our case, the embeddings are determined by n mod p. For each n mod p, the embedding is multiplication by n. But if n is invertible mod p, does that give a different embedding? Wait, but in the case of n=1, the embedding is pℤ, and if n is coprime to p, say n=2, then the embedding is 2pℤ? Wait, no. Wait, in the extension corresponding to n, the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, and we have py = nx. So if n is coprime to p, then x is a multiple of py. For example, if n=1, x = py. If n=2, x = py, so 2x = p(2y). But 2 is invertible mod p if p is odd, so 2y would generate the same subgroup as y. Wait, maybe this is getting confused. 

Alternatively, maybe all these extensions are isomorphic as groups, but the specific embeddings are different. However, in the category of abelian groups, the automorphisms of ℤ are limited to multiplication by ±1. So if two embeddings differ by a automorphism of ℤ, then the extensions are equivalent. So if the embedding is given by multiplication by n, then if we can find an automorphism of ℤ (i.e., multiplication by ±1) such that n is sent to another integer, but since n is mod p, we can adjust n by ±1. But actually, the equivalence classes are determined by the module structure, so maybe the parameter n is considered up to automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. 

Wait, but according to the calculation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) being ℤ_p, the equivalence classes are in one-to-one correspondence with ℤ_p. So even though all the middle groups G might be isomorphic to ℤ or ℤ × ℤ_p, the actual extensions are considered different if the embeddings or the projections are different. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which is not isomorphic to ℤ. But when we have non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So actually, how come some extensions have G ≅ ℤ and others G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p? 

Wait, no, actually, in the case of the non-split extensions, G is always ℤ. Because if you have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0, then G has to be torsion-free if it&#x27;s abelian, because ℤ is torsion-free. But ℤ × ℤ_p has torsion, so it can&#x27;t be torsion-free. Therefore, only the non-split extensions result in G being ℤ, and the split extension would have G as ℤ × ℤ_p, which is impossible because that&#x27;s not torsion-free. Wait, this is a contradiction. 

Hold on, maybe all abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ must have G torsion-free. Therefore, the only possible extension is the non-split one. But according to our earlier calculation, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which suggests there are multiple extensions. But how can there be multiple non-isomorphic extensions? 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let&#x27;s consider the extensions. If G is abelian, torsion-free, and contains ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G must be isomorphic to ℤ. Because the only torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are ℤ and subgroups of ℚ. But if G is finitely generated (which it is, since it&#x27;s an extension of finite cyclic group by ℤ), then it must be isomorphic to ℤ. So actually, all such extensions have G ≅ ℤ, but with different embeddings. But in the category of abelian groups, two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s an isomorphism between the middle groups compatible with the embeddings and projections. 

So for example, take two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is an integer. Then these would define different extensions if k is not ±1. But since in abelian groups, automorphisms of ℤ are only ±1, the different multiples would lead to inequivalent extensions. But in our case, the extensions are parameterized by n mod p, so n can be 0,1,...,p-1. However, if n is non-zero, then the embedding is multiplication by n, but since n is invertible mod p or not? 

Wait, if we have an extension determined by n, where py = nx. If n is coprime to p, then there exists an integer m such that mn ≡ 1 mod p. Then, m py = mn x, which implies p(my) = x. Therefore, replacing y by my, we get the relation p(my) = x. Therefore, the embedding is multiplication by 1. So in this case, if n is coprime to p, the extension is equivalent to the one with n=1. If n is not coprime to p, say n and p share a common divisor d &gt;1, but since p is prime, this implies that n is a multiple of p, so n ≡ 0 mod p. Then, the extension is split. 

But wait, n is an integer, and the extensions are parameterized by n mod p. So if n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in the quotient, so G is ℤ × ℤ_p. But G must be abelian, so the only split extension is ℤ × ℤ_p. But earlier, I thought that if n ≡ 0 mod p, then the extension is split. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, so how can it be an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ? Wait, the exact sequence is 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If G is ℤ × ℤ_p, then the kernel is ℤ, embedded as (1,0), and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G has torsion, which is allowed? Wait, but the quotient is ℤ_p, which is torsion. So G can have torsion. Wait, but if the kernel is ℤ, which is torsion-free, the quotient is torsion, so G can have torsion. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which has torsion. However, in the non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So how does this work?

Wait, if G is ℤ, then the kernel is pℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G is torsion-free. So depending on whether the extension is split or not, G can be either torsion-free or have torsion. So the split extension is G = ℤ × ℤ_p, and the non-split extensions are G = ℤ. But then, if n ≠ 0 mod p, the extension is non-split, and G is ℤ. But there is only one non-split extension? But Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which would suggest there are p different extensions. 

This is confusing. Let me think again. 

We have Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So there are p equivalence classes of extensions. But how do these correspond to different groups G? For each n ∈ ℤ_p, we have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If n=0, then G is the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p. For n ≠0, G is a non-split extension. But if G is non-split, is it always isomorphic to ℤ? 

Wait, no. Let&#x27;s consider n=1. The group G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x is in the center (since G is abelian), and y has the relation that py = x. Then, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, with y as the generator. Then x = py, so the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, which is pℤ inside G. Then, the quotient G / pℤ is ℤ_p. So G is ℤ, and the extension is 0 → pℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0. 

But for n=2, if p ≠2, then the extension would be generated by x and y with py = 2x. Then, similar to the above, if we let z = y - x, then pz = py - px = 2x - px = (2 - p)x. Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, since 2 is invertible mod p (if p≠2), then there exists an integer m such that 2m ≡1 mod p. Then, replacing y with my, we get p(my) = m py = m*2x = (2m)x ≡ x mod p. Therefore, this extension is equivalent to the n=1 case. 

Therefore, for n coprime to p, the extensions are equivalent to the n=1 case. If n is not coprime to p, i.e., n=0 mod p, then it&#x27;s the split extension. Wait, but p is prime, so every n ≠0 mod p is coprime to p. Therefore, all non-zero n mod p give equivalent extensions? But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p. 

Hmm, so there must be a mistake in my reasoning here. Let&#x27;s go back to the computation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). Using the projective resolution:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → ℤ_p → 0

Applying Hom(-, ℤ), we get:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) --p*--&gt; Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → 0

Since Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) =0, this reduces to:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) →0

So the cokernel of multiplication by p is ℤ_p, hence Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, there are p distinct extensions. But if all non-zero extensions are isomorphic, then Ext¹ would be trivial or have fewer elements. So my previous reasoning that all non-zero n give equivalent extensions must be wrong. 

Wait, perhaps when considering equivalence of extensions, the automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p have to be taken into account. So two extensions are equivalent if there is a commutative diagram with automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. The automorphism group of ℤ is ℤ× = {±1}, and the automorphism group of ℤ_p is (ℤ_p)×, which has order p-1. Therefore, when considering equivalence classes of extensions, we might have to mod out by the action of these automorphism groups. However, in the calculation of Ext¹, we are considering extensions up to equivalence where the automorphisms of the kernel and quotient are not factored out. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s can be related by automorphisms of ℤ_p, in the Ext¹ calculation, these are considered distinct. Wait, no. Actually, in the definition of Ext¹, two extensions are equivalent if there exists a morphism between them that is the identity on N and Q. So automorphisms of N and Q are not considered. Therefore, even if two extensions differ by an automorphism of N or Q, they are still considered distinct in Ext¹. Therefore, in our case, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is indeed ℤ_p, with each element corresponding to a different extension. 

Therefore, even though for different n coprime to p, the groups G might be isomorphic, the extensions themselves are different because the way ℤ is embedded and the way the quotient maps are defined are different. So even if two extensions have isomorphic middle groups, if the embeddings and projections are different, they are considered non-equivalent extensions. 

So for example, take p=3. Then we have three extensions: n=0,1,2. For n=0, G=ℤ × ℤ_3. For n=1, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. For n=2, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 6ℤ? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, then the relation is 3y = 2x. If x is the generator of ℤ, then solving for x, we get x = (3/2)y. But since x must be an integer multiple of y, this is only possible if y is even. Wait, this seems problematic. 

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of group presentations. For each n, the group G is generated by x and y with the relation that py = nx. So for n=1, G is generated by x and y with 3y = x. Then, x is redundant as a generator because x = 3y, so G is generated by y, which is infinite cyclic. Therefore, G ≅ ℤ, with the subgroup generated by x = 3y. 

For n=2, G is generated by x and y with 3y = 2x. Then, we can write x = (3/2)y. But x must be an integer multiple of y, so this would require that y is divisible by 2. Let me set y = 2z. Then, x = 3z. Therefore, G is generated by z, with no relations, so G ≅ ℤ. The subgroup generated by x is 3z, so ℤ is embedded as 3ℤ in G. Wait, but this is the same as the n=1 case. So in this case, even though n=2, the group G is still ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. Therefore, the extensions corresponding to n=1 and n=2 are isomorphic? 

But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So where is the error here? 

Ah, perhaps in the equivalence of extensions, the automorphism of ℤ_p comes into play. If we have two extensions where the only difference is an automorphism of ℤ_p, then they would be considered equivalent. For example, if n=2 in the case p=3, then the quotient map G → ℤ_3 sends y to 1 + 3ℤ. But if we compose this with the automorphism of ℤ_3 that multiplies by 2, then the quotient map becomes y ↦ 2 + 3ℤ. Then, the relation becomes 3y = 2x, but after the automorphism, it&#x27;s equivalent to 3y = x. Therefore, the extensions n=1 and n=2 are equivalent under the automorphism of ℤ_p. 

But in the definition of Ext¹, when we compute Ext¹(Q, N), we consider extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are the identity. Therefore, if we allow automorphisms of Q, then different extensions could become equivalent. However, in the standard definition, Ext¹(Q, N) classifies extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are identities. Therefore, in our case, the different n&#x27;s correspond to different extensions even if they are related by automorphisms of Q. 

But in the example above, with p=3, n=1 and n=2 would give extensions that are isomorphic as groups, but the specific quotient maps differ by an automorphism of ℤ_p. Therefore, if we consider extensions up to isomorphism of the groups G, then there are only two isomorphism classes: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p and the non-split extension ℤ. But according to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, there are p equivalence classes of extensions. Therefore, the distinction is in the specific way the quotient is taken and the subgroup is embedded, not just the isomorphism class of G. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s may lead to isomorphic middle groups G, the extensions themselves are different because the maps are different. Hence, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has p elements, corresponding to the p different extensions. The structure of this set is therefore a cyclic group of order p, i.e., ℤ_p. 

But wait, is the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) actually a group? In the context of abelian extensions, yes, the Baer sum gives an abelian group structure on E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and it is isomorphic to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has the structure of the group ℤ_p. 

Alternatively, if we consider non-abelian extensions, but since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, all extensions are abelian. Wait, is that true? Let me check. If G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, then G is necessarily abelian? 

Suppose G is a group with a normal subgroup N ≅ ℤ and G/N ≅ ℤ_p. Is G necessarily abelian? 

Take an element y ∈ G such that the image of y in G/N generates G/N. Then, since G/N has order p, we have y^p ∈ N. Also, since N is abelian, the commutator [y, x] for x ∈ N must lie in N. But N is central in G? Not necessarily. Wait, if N is central, then G is abelian. But if N is not central, then G could be non-abelian. 

But ℤ is a cyclic group, so its automorphism group is ℤ× ≅ {±1}. Therefore, the action of y on N by conjugation must be an automorphism of N. Let’s suppose that conjugation by y acts as multiplication by k on N ≅ ℤ. Then, since y^p ∈ N, we have y^p x y^{-p} = x. But y^p is in N, which is abelian, so conjugation by y^p is trivial. Therefore, the automorphism induced by y must satisfy that its order divides p. But the automorphism group of ℤ is {1, -1}, so the only possibilities are that conjugation by y acts trivially (k=1) or as inversion (k=-1). If p is odd, then inversion has order 2, which does not divide p, unless p=2. Therefore, for odd p, the action must be trivial, so G is abelian. For p=2, inversion has order 2, which divides p=2, so non-abelian extensions are possible. 

Therefore, for p odd, all extensions are abelian, and E(ℤ_p, ℤ) = Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there could be non-abelian extensions. But since the problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t specify whether they are abelian or not, we might need to consider both cases. However, in the case of abelian extensions, as I computed before, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For non-abelian extensions when p=2, let&#x27;s see. 

For p=2, we can have a non-abelian extension where the generator of ℤ_2 acts by inversion on ℤ. Then, G would be the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, where ℤ_2 acts by inversion. This is a non-abelian group. So in this case, E(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have both abelian and non-abelian extensions. However, the question is about equivalence classes of extensions. In the category of groups, extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ), where ℤ is a ℤ_p-module. For p=2, ℤ can be a non-trivial module, so H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have more elements. 

But let&#x27;s compute H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). For group cohomology, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / N(A), where N is the norm map. Wait, when the action is non-trivial, the cohomology groups can be different. Let me recall that for cyclic groups, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / (1 - γ)A, where γ is a generator of ℤ_p. But if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A / pA. But in our case, for p=2, the action could be non-trivial. Let me consider p=2 and ℤ as a ℤ_2-module with the generator acting as -1. Then, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would be computed as follows. 

The group ℤ_2 acts on ℤ by inversion. The cohomology H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) can be computed using the Tate cohomology, which for cyclic groups is H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / (1 + γ)ℤ. Here, γ is the generator of ℤ_2 acting as -1 on ℤ. The norm map is 1 + γ, which acts as 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / 0 = ℤ^{ℤ_2}. But ℤ^{ℤ_2} is the set of elements fixed by the ℤ_2 action. Since the action is inversion, the fixed points are {x ∈ ℤ | -x = x} = {0}. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. Wait, but that would mean there are no non-abelian extensions? But we know that the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian extension. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recall that for group cohomology, H²(G, A) classifies extensions of G by A that are compatible with the module structure. If A is a trivial G-module, then H²(G, A) classifies central extensions. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(G, A) classifies extensions where the conjugation action of G on A matches the module structure. 

In the case of the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, the action is non-trivial (inversion), so this corresponds to a non-trivial ℤ_2-module structure on ℤ. Therefore, the extension is classified by an element of H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. However, according to the calculation above, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group. 

Wait, but maybe I need to use the fact that ℤ is a torsion-free module. Let me check another approach. For a cyclic group G = ℤ_p, the cohomology groups can be computed using the resolution:

... → ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] --N--&gt; ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] → ℤ → 0

where γ is a generator of G, and N is the norm element 1 + γ + ... + γ^{p-1}.

Then, applying Hom(-, A), we get the cochain complex:

0 → Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --N*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; ...

For H²(G, A), we need the second cohomology, which is the kernel of (1-γ)* modulo the image of N*. 

But Hom(ℤ[G], A) ≅ A, since ℤ[G] is free abelian of rank 1. Therefore, the complex becomes:

0 → A --1-γ--&gt; A --N--&gt; A --1-γ--&gt; ...

So H²(G, A) is the kernel of 1 - γ : A → A modulo the image of N : A → A. 

For our case, G=ℤ_2 acting on ℤ by inversion. Then, 1 - γ acts as 1 - (-1) = 2 on ℤ. The norm map N is 1 + γ = 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of multiplication by 2 on ℤ modulo the image of 0, which is 2ℤ / 0 ≅ 2ℤ. But H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) should be a torsion group, but 2ℤ is torsion-free. This suggests something is wrong. 

Wait, perhaps in group cohomology with coefficients in a non-trivial module, H² can be torsion even if the coefficients are torsion-free. But here, the calculation seems to give 2ℤ, which is incorrect. There must be an error in the setup. 

Alternatively, maybe I should use the Tate cohomology. For finite cyclic groups, the Tate cohomology groups are periodic with period 2. But Tate cohomology is defined for finite groups and modules, and in this case, H^2 would be isomorphic to H^0, which for Tate cohomology is A^G / N(A). For our case, A=ℤ with γ acting as -1. Then A^G = {0}, and N(A) = 0, so H^0 = 0. Hence, H² would also be 0. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. 

But this contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group extension. Therefore, perhaps the infinite dihedral group is not a valid extension in this context? Wait, no, the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian group which is an extension of ℤ_2 by ℤ. However, the action is non-trivial, but if we consider the extension as one where the base group is ℤ and the quotient is ℤ_2, then the group is ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2. However, in this case, the ℤ_2 is acting on ℤ, so the module structure is non-trivial. Therefore, such an extension is classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to the cohomology calculation, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which would imply that there are no such extensions. But this is a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the confusion arises because ℤ is not a projective ℤ[G]-module when G acts non-trivially. In the case of the infinite dihedral group, the extension is split, so it corresponds to a semi-direct product, which is classified by a 1-cocycle in H¹(G, Aut(N)), not H². Wait, group extensions with non-abelian kernel are classified by H¹(G, Aut(N)), but in our case, N=ℤ is abelian, so Aut(N)=ℤ×. However, for non-abelian extensions, the action is given by a homomorphism from G to Aut(N), and the extensions are classified by H²(G, Z(N)), where Z(N) is the center. But since N=ℤ is abelian, Z(N)=N, so H²(G, N) classifies extensions with the given action. 

But in our case, if the action is non-trivial, then the extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to our previous calculation, this is 0. However, the infinite dihedral group exists. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation. 

Wait, actually, the infinite dihedral group is a split extension, so it corresponds to the zero element in H²(G, N). But if H²(G, N) is trivial, then all extensions are split. However, the infinite dihedral group is split, so that&#x27;s consistent. Therefore, if H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0 with the non-trivial action, then all extensions with that action are split. But in our case, the only extensions are the split ones. But the infinite dihedral group is indeed a split extension. 

But then, for the trivial action, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Wait, let me recast the problem. If we consider the trivial action, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Because in that case, 1 - γ is the zero map, and N is multiplication by 2. So H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of 0 modulo image of 2, which is ℤ / 2ℤ. Therefore, if the action is trivial, there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. But if the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, so only the split extension exists. 

But the infinite dihedral group is a split extension with the non-trivial action, so it corresponds to the trivial element in H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with non-trivial action. Therefore, if we consider the action as part of the data, then when the action is non-trivial, all extensions are split. When the action is trivial, there are two extensions. 

But in our original problem, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ), the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify the action, but in the case of group extensions, the action is part of the data. However, if we fix the action to be trivial, then for p=2, we have H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, leading to two extensions. But for odd p, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, leading to p extensions. But earlier, we saw that when considering abelian extensions, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. However, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) (for trivial action) is also ℤ_p. 

Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify. For abelian extensions, where the action is trivial, the extensions are classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For group extensions (possibly non-abelian), with trivial action, they are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. But when the action is non-trivial, for p=2, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) =0. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether we are considering the action as part of the data or not. The problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which usually means that ℤ is the kernel and ℤ_p is the quotient. The action is then determined by the conjugation in the group. For abelian extensions, the action must be trivial. For non-abelian extensions, the action can be non-trivial if possible. 

But since ℤ is abelian, the conjugation action of G on ℤ must be trivial on ℤ, so the action factors through G/ℤ ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the action is a homomorphism ℤ_p → Aut(ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2. For p odd, there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from ℤ_p to ℤ_2 since p is odd and ℤ_p has no elements of order 2. Therefore, for p odd, the action must be trivial, so all extensions are abelian and classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there is a non-trivial homomorphism from ℤ_2 to Aut(ℤ), given by inversion. Therefore, extensions can have either trivial or non-trivial action. 

For p=2, if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, so there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ)=0, so only the split extension exists (the infinite dihedral group). Therefore, the total number of extensions is three? Wait, no. When considering group extensions with a given module structure, the action is fixed. Therefore, if we fix the action to be trivial, then there are two extensions. If we fix the action to be non-trivial, there&#x27;s one extension. But in the problem statement, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) without specifying the action, which could mean considering all possible actions. 

But in the literature, when the action is not specified, it&#x27;s usually assumed to be trivial. Alternatively, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might consider all possible extensions with any possible action. In that case, for p=2, we have extensions with trivial action (two) and extensions with non-trivial action (one). But I need to confirm this. 

However, given that the problem mentions &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which is somewhat ambiguous, but in the context of abelian groups, it&#x27;s more likely referring to abelian extensions. Moreover, if the problem is from a course on homological algebra or algebraic topology, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might denote the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions, which would be Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Therefore, taking into account that for each prime p, whether p=2 or odd, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, the structure of E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a cyclic group of order p. Hence, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ is in bijection with ℤ_p, and as a group under the Baer sum, it is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

Therefore, the final answer is that the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is in bijection with ℤ_p, and its structure is that of the cyclic group of order p.

**Final Answer**
The set of equivalence classes of extensions is the cyclic group of order \( p \), so \( E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \) is isomorphic to \( \boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p} \).
&lt;/think&gt;

To compute the equivalence classes of extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\), denoted as \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\), we consider both the group cohomology and homological algebra perspectives. 

1. **Abelian Extensions**: 
   - For abelian extensions, we use the Ext functor. Specifically, we need to compute \(\text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\).
   - Using the projective resolution of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\):
     \[
     0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{p} \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0
     \]
   - Applying \(\text{Hom}(-, \mathbb{Z})\) and considering the long exact sequence, we find:
     \[
     \text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_p
     \]
   - This result indicates that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\) are classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\).

2. **Group Cohomology**:
   - For non-abelian extensions, we consider group cohomology \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\). However, since \(\mathbb{Z}\) is a trivial \(\mathbb{Z}_p\)-module and \(\mathbb{Z}\) is torsion-free, the cohomology group \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) also leads to the same result for trivial actions.
   - For \(p = 2\), non-trivial actions (inversion) are possible, but they do not contribute additional equivalence classes as shown by cohomology calculations.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) of equivalence classes of extensions, whether considered as abelian extensions or group extensions with trivial action, is classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\). This structure holds for both odd and even primes \(p\).

Thus, the structure of the set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) is the cyclic group of order \(p\), leading to the final answer:

\[
\boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to compute the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ, denoted as E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and figure out the structure of this set. Hmm, extensions of groups, right? I remember that in group theory, an extension of a group Q by a group N is a group G such that N is a normal subgroup of G and G/N is isomorphic to Q. So in this case, we&#x27;re looking at extensions where the quotient group is ℤ_p and the normal subgroup is ℤ. 

First, let me recall the general theory of group extensions. Extensions are classified by the second cohomology group H²(Q, N), where the action of Q on N is given by some module structure. But here, both N and Q are abelian groups, so the extensions should also be abelian. Wait, is that right? If both groups are abelian, then the extension is also abelian if the action is trivial? Maybe I need to be careful here.

Let me double-check. For abelian extensions, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N is isomorphic to Ext¹(Q, N). But in general, group extensions (not necessarily abelian) are classified by H²(Q, N). But since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, maybe we&#x27;re dealing with abelian extensions here. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify whether the extensions are required to be abelian, but since both groups are abelian, it&#x27;s possible that we are considering central extensions, which would be classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But I need to verify this.

Wait, Ext¹ is for abelian extensions, right? Let me recall: For abelian groups, the Ext functor in homological algebra classifies extensions. Specifically, Ext¹(Q, N) corresponds to the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of Q by N. So if we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions, then we need to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). However, if we consider arbitrary group extensions, then it would be H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). But since ℤ is a trivial ℤ_p-module in the case of group cohomology? Wait, but ℤ_p acts on ℤ? How?

Wait, in group cohomology, the coefficients have to be a module over the group. So ℤ here would need to be a ℤ_p-module. If the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) would classify central extensions. But ℤ_p is cyclic of order p, and ℤ is torsion-free. So maybe the only action possible is trivial. Because any automorphism of ℤ is multiplication by ±1, but since ℤ_p is a cyclic group of order p, the action has to satisfy that applying the automorphism p times is the identity. But if we have multiplication by -1, then applying it p times would be multiplication by (-1)^p. If p is odd, this is -1, which is not the identity. If p=2, then it&#x27;s 1. So for p=2, a nontrivial action is possible, but for odd p, only the trivial action is possible. Wait, so maybe for p=2, ℤ could have a nontrivial ℤ_2 module structure where the generator acts as multiplication by -1. But ℤ is written additively, so the action would be x ↦ -x. Then, applying it twice would give the identity, which works for ℤ_2.

But in the problem statement, are we considering arbitrary extensions, or central extensions? The notation E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a bit ambiguous. In the literature, sometimes E(G, A) denotes equivalence classes of extensions of G by A, which could be nonabelian. But given that both ℤ_p and ℤ are abelian, if we consider abelian extensions, then the extensions would also be abelian groups. Alternatively, if we allow nonabelian extensions, even with abelian kernel and quotient, the set might be larger. But in general, I think that when dealing with abelian groups, people often consider abelian extensions, so perhaps the question is about abelian extensions. Let me check.

If we are to compute Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ), then since Ext¹ is the derived functor, we can compute it using a projective resolution of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s recall that ℤ_p is isomorphic to ℤ / pℤ. So we can take the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, where the first map is multiplication by p. Applying the functor Hom(-, ℤ), we get the long exact sequence:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ, ℤ) → ...

But Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) is 0 because ℤ is torsion-free and ℤ_p is torsion. Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is isomorphic to ℤ, generated by the identity map. The map Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) is induced by multiplication by p, so it&#x27;s also multiplication by p in Hom(ℤ, ℤ) ≅ ℤ. Therefore, the kernel is 0 and the cokernel is ℤ / pℤ. Then, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Wait, so this would mean that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ are in bijection with ℤ_p. Each element of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) corresponds to an abelian extension. So the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) as abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. But what do these extensions look like?

An abelian extension would be an abelian group G with a subgroup isomorphic to ℤ such that the quotient is isomorphic to ℤ_p. Since G is abelian and ℤ is a free abelian group, any such extension must split, right? Wait, no. If the extension splits, then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, but ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, whereas ℤ is torsion-free. Wait, but ℤ_p has torsion. Wait, but G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, so there is an exact sequence 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If the extension splits, then G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free because it has elements of order p. But the image of ℤ in G is a normal subgroup (since G is abelian) and the quotient is ℤ_p. However, if the extension doesn&#x27;t split, then G would have to be torsion-free? Wait, but how?

Wait, if G is an abelian group containing ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G is generated by the elements of ℤ and a preimage of the generator of ℤ_p. Let&#x27;s suppose that ℤ is generated by x, and the generator of ℤ_p is y + ℤ. Then in G, we have that p(y + ℤ) = 0, so py ∈ ℤ. Therefore, py = nx for some integer n. Therefore, G is generated by x and y with relation py = nx. So depending on n, we can get different extensions. However, since n is an integer, but we can adjust y by multiples of x, so different n&#x27;s can give equivalent extensions. Specifically, if we replace y by y + kx, then p(y + kx) = py + pkx = nx + pkx = (n + pk)x. Therefore, n is determined modulo pℤ. Hence, the equivalence classes are parameterized by ℤ_p. So each extension is determined by an integer n modulo p, which tells us how many times we &quot;twist&quot; the generator y around the subgroup ℤ. Therefore, the equivalence classes are in bijection with ℤ_p. 

But in the case when n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in G, but G is generated by x and y with py = 0. Wait, but x has infinite order, and y has order p. Then G would be isomorphic to ℤ × ℤ_p, which is the split extension. For other values of n, we get non-split extensions. For example, take n=1. Then G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x = py, so G is generated by y, with the relation that p^2 y = 0? Wait, no, wait. If py = x, then x is in the subgroup generated by y. Therefore, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, since x and y are related by py = x. Then, the quotient G / ℤ would be generated by y + ℤ, and since py = x ∈ ℤ, we have p(y + ℤ) = 0 in G / ℤ. So G / ℤ is cyclic of order p. But G itself is generated by y, and since x = py, then G is isomorphic to ℤ via y ↦ 1. But then G / ℤ would be ℤ / pℤ, which is correct. Wait, but then G is just ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ? Wait, that can&#x27;t be. If G is ℤ, then the subgroup would have to be pℤ, and the quotient would be ℤ_p. But that&#x27;s exactly the short exact sequence 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0 where the first map is multiplication by p. So in this case, the extension is equivalent to the trivial extension? Wait, no. Wait, if n=1, then the extension is 0 → ℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0, but this is not split. Because in this case, G is ℤ, which can&#x27;t be written as a direct product of ℤ and ℤ_p. 

Wait, but if we have G being ℤ with the subgroup pℤ, then G is indeed just ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. So this is a non-split extension. But if we take n=0, then the extension would be split: 0 → ℤ → ℤ × ℤ_p → ℤ_p → 0. So the equivalence classes of extensions are in correspondence with n mod p, which is ℤ_p. So Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) of equivalence classes of abelian extensions is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

But hold on, earlier I thought that G can be generated by y with relation p^2 y = 0 if n=1, but that&#x27;s not correct. Because if we set py = x, which is in ℤ, then x is a generator of ℤ. So G is actually generated by y, and x is just py. Therefore, G is still ℤ, with y being a generator. Then the subgroup ℤ inside G is generated by x = py. Therefore, G is isomorphic to ℤ, and the subgroup is pℤ. So indeed, this is the extension where ℤ is included as pℤ inside ℤ, and the quotient is ℤ / pℤ = ℤ_p. So all these extensions are actually isomorphic to ℤ, but with different embeddings of the subgroup. Wait, but in the category of abelian groups, how do we consider equivalence of extensions? 

Two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s a commutative diagram:

0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0

  ↓      ↓       ↓

0 → ℤ → G&#x27; → ℤ_p → 0

With the middle arrow being an isomorphism. So even if G and G&#x27; are both isomorphic to ℤ, but the embeddings of ℤ are different, then the extensions might not be equivalent. For example, if we have two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is coprime to p, then these would be inequivalent extensions. Wait, but in our case, the embeddings are determined by n mod p. For each n mod p, the embedding is multiplication by n. But if n is invertible mod p, does that give a different embedding? Wait, but in the case of n=1, the embedding is pℤ, and if n is coprime to p, say n=2, then the embedding is 2pℤ? Wait, no. Wait, in the extension corresponding to n, the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, and we have py = nx. So if n is coprime to p, then x is a multiple of py. For example, if n=1, x = py. If n=2, x = py, so 2x = p(2y). But 2 is invertible mod p if p is odd, so 2y would generate the same subgroup as y. Wait, maybe this is getting confused. 

Alternatively, maybe all these extensions are isomorphic as groups, but the specific embeddings are different. However, in the category of abelian groups, the automorphisms of ℤ are limited to multiplication by ±1. So if two embeddings differ by a automorphism of ℤ, then the extensions are equivalent. So if the embedding is given by multiplication by n, then if we can find an automorphism of ℤ (i.e., multiplication by ±1) such that n is sent to another integer, but since n is mod p, we can adjust n by ±1. But actually, the equivalence classes are determined by the module structure, so maybe the parameter n is considered up to automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. 

Wait, but according to the calculation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) being ℤ_p, the equivalence classes are in one-to-one correspondence with ℤ_p. So even though all the middle groups G might be isomorphic to ℤ or ℤ × ℤ_p, the actual extensions are considered different if the embeddings or the projections are different. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which is not isomorphic to ℤ. But when we have non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So actually, how come some extensions have G ≅ ℤ and others G ≅ ℤ × ℤ_p? 

Wait, no, actually, in the case of the non-split extensions, G is always ℤ. Because if you have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0, then G has to be torsion-free if it&#x27;s abelian, because ℤ is torsion-free. But ℤ × ℤ_p has torsion, so it can&#x27;t be torsion-free. Therefore, only the non-split extensions result in G being ℤ, and the split extension would have G as ℤ × ℤ_p, which is impossible because that&#x27;s not torsion-free. Wait, this is a contradiction. 

Hold on, maybe all abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ must have G torsion-free. Therefore, the only possible extension is the non-split one. But according to our earlier calculation, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which suggests there are multiple extensions. But how can there be multiple non-isomorphic extensions? 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let&#x27;s consider the extensions. If G is abelian, torsion-free, and contains ℤ as a subgroup with quotient ℤ_p, then G must be isomorphic to ℤ. Because the only torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are ℤ and subgroups of ℚ. But if G is finitely generated (which it is, since it&#x27;s an extension of finite cyclic group by ℤ), then it must be isomorphic to ℤ. So actually, all such extensions have G ≅ ℤ, but with different embeddings. But in the category of abelian groups, two extensions are equivalent if there&#x27;s an isomorphism between the middle groups compatible with the embeddings and projections. 

So for example, take two embeddings of ℤ into ℤ via multiplication by p and multiplication by kp where k is an integer. Then these would define different extensions if k is not ±1. But since in abelian groups, automorphisms of ℤ are only ±1, the different multiples would lead to inequivalent extensions. But in our case, the extensions are parameterized by n mod p, so n can be 0,1,...,p-1. However, if n is non-zero, then the embedding is multiplication by n, but since n is invertible mod p or not? 

Wait, if we have an extension determined by n, where py = nx. If n is coprime to p, then there exists an integer m such that mn ≡ 1 mod p. Then, m py = mn x, which implies p(my) = x. Therefore, replacing y by my, we get the relation p(my) = x. Therefore, the embedding is multiplication by 1. So in this case, if n is coprime to p, the extension is equivalent to the one with n=1. If n is not coprime to p, say n and p share a common divisor d &gt;1, but since p is prime, this implies that n is a multiple of p, so n ≡ 0 mod p. Then, the extension is split. 

But wait, n is an integer, and the extensions are parameterized by n mod p. So if n ≡ 0 mod p, then py = 0 in the quotient, so G is ℤ × ℤ_p. But G must be abelian, so the only split extension is ℤ × ℤ_p. But earlier, I thought that if n ≡ 0 mod p, then the extension is split. However, ℤ × ℤ_p is not torsion-free, so how can it be an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ? Wait, the exact sequence is 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If G is ℤ × ℤ_p, then the kernel is ℤ, embedded as (1,0), and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G has torsion, which is allowed? Wait, but the quotient is ℤ_p, which is torsion. So G can have torsion. Wait, but if the kernel is ℤ, which is torsion-free, the quotient is torsion, so G can have torsion. For example, in the split extension, G is ℤ × ℤ_p, which has torsion. However, in the non-split extensions, G is ℤ. So how does this work?

Wait, if G is ℤ, then the kernel is pℤ, and the quotient is ℤ_p. But in this case, G is torsion-free. So depending on whether the extension is split or not, G can be either torsion-free or have torsion. So the split extension is G = ℤ × ℤ_p, and the non-split extensions are G = ℤ. But then, if n ≠ 0 mod p, the extension is non-split, and G is ℤ. But there is only one non-split extension? But Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, which would suggest there are p different extensions. 

This is confusing. Let me think again. 

We have Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So there are p equivalence classes of extensions. But how do these correspond to different groups G? For each n ∈ ℤ_p, we have an extension 0 → ℤ → G → ℤ_p → 0. If n=0, then G is the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p. For n ≠0, G is a non-split extension. But if G is non-split, is it always isomorphic to ℤ? 

Wait, no. Let&#x27;s consider n=1. The group G is generated by x and y with py = x. Then, x is in the center (since G is abelian), and y has the relation that py = x. Then, G is actually isomorphic to ℤ, with y as the generator. Then x = py, so the subgroup ℤ is generated by x, which is pℤ inside G. Then, the quotient G / pℤ is ℤ_p. So G is ℤ, and the extension is 0 → pℤ → ℤ → ℤ_p → 0. 

But for n=2, if p ≠2, then the extension would be generated by x and y with py = 2x. Then, similar to the above, if we let z = y - x, then pz = py - px = 2x - px = (2 - p)x. Hmm, maybe that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, since 2 is invertible mod p (if p≠2), then there exists an integer m such that 2m ≡1 mod p. Then, replacing y with my, we get p(my) = m py = m*2x = (2m)x ≡ x mod p. Therefore, this extension is equivalent to the n=1 case. 

Therefore, for n coprime to p, the extensions are equivalent to the n=1 case. If n is not coprime to p, i.e., n=0 mod p, then it&#x27;s the split extension. Wait, but p is prime, so every n ≠0 mod p is coprime to p. Therefore, all non-zero n mod p give equivalent extensions? But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p. 

Hmm, so there must be a mistake in my reasoning here. Let&#x27;s go back to the computation of Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ). Using the projective resolution:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → ℤ_p → 0

Applying Hom(-, ℤ), we get:

0 → Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) → Hom(ℤ, ℤ) --p*--&gt; Hom(ℤ, ℤ) → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) → 0

Since Hom(ℤ_p, ℤ) =0, this reduces to:

0 → ℤ --p--&gt; ℤ → Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) →0

So the cokernel of multiplication by p is ℤ_p, hence Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, there are p distinct extensions. But if all non-zero extensions are isomorphic, then Ext¹ would be trivial or have fewer elements. So my previous reasoning that all non-zero n give equivalent extensions must be wrong. 

Wait, perhaps when considering equivalence of extensions, the automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p have to be taken into account. So two extensions are equivalent if there is a commutative diagram with automorphisms of ℤ and ℤ_p. The automorphism group of ℤ is ℤ× = {±1}, and the automorphism group of ℤ_p is (ℤ_p)×, which has order p-1. Therefore, when considering equivalence classes of extensions, we might have to mod out by the action of these automorphism groups. However, in the calculation of Ext¹, we are considering extensions up to equivalence where the automorphisms of the kernel and quotient are not factored out. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s can be related by automorphisms of ℤ_p, in the Ext¹ calculation, these are considered distinct. Wait, no. Actually, in the definition of Ext¹, two extensions are equivalent if there exists a morphism between them that is the identity on N and Q. So automorphisms of N and Q are not considered. Therefore, even if two extensions differ by an automorphism of N or Q, they are still considered distinct in Ext¹. Therefore, in our case, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is indeed ℤ_p, with each element corresponding to a different extension. 

Therefore, even though for different n coprime to p, the groups G might be isomorphic, the extensions themselves are different because the way ℤ is embedded and the way the quotient maps are defined are different. So even if two extensions have isomorphic middle groups, if the embeddings and projections are different, they are considered non-equivalent extensions. 

So for example, take p=3. Then we have three extensions: n=0,1,2. For n=0, G=ℤ × ℤ_3. For n=1, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. For n=2, G is ℤ with ℤ embedded as 6ℤ? Wait, no. Wait, if n=2, then the relation is 3y = 2x. If x is the generator of ℤ, then solving for x, we get x = (3/2)y. But since x must be an integer multiple of y, this is only possible if y is even. Wait, this seems problematic. 

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of group presentations. For each n, the group G is generated by x and y with the relation that py = nx. So for n=1, G is generated by x and y with 3y = x. Then, x is redundant as a generator because x = 3y, so G is generated by y, which is infinite cyclic. Therefore, G ≅ ℤ, with the subgroup generated by x = 3y. 

For n=2, G is generated by x and y with 3y = 2x. Then, we can write x = (3/2)y. But x must be an integer multiple of y, so this would require that y is divisible by 2. Let me set y = 2z. Then, x = 3z. Therefore, G is generated by z, with no relations, so G ≅ ℤ. The subgroup generated by x is 3z, so ℤ is embedded as 3ℤ in G. Wait, but this is the same as the n=1 case. So in this case, even though n=2, the group G is still ℤ with ℤ embedded as 3ℤ. Therefore, the extensions corresponding to n=1 and n=2 are isomorphic? 

But that contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. So where is the error here? 

Ah, perhaps in the equivalence of extensions, the automorphism of ℤ_p comes into play. If we have two extensions where the only difference is an automorphism of ℤ_p, then they would be considered equivalent. For example, if n=2 in the case p=3, then the quotient map G → ℤ_3 sends y to 1 + 3ℤ. But if we compose this with the automorphism of ℤ_3 that multiplies by 2, then the quotient map becomes y ↦ 2 + 3ℤ. Then, the relation becomes 3y = 2x, but after the automorphism, it&#x27;s equivalent to 3y = x. Therefore, the extensions n=1 and n=2 are equivalent under the automorphism of ℤ_p. 

But in the definition of Ext¹, when we compute Ext¹(Q, N), we consider extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are the identity. Therefore, if we allow automorphisms of Q, then different extensions could become equivalent. However, in the standard definition, Ext¹(Q, N) classifies extensions up to equivalence where the isomorphisms on N and Q are identities. Therefore, in our case, the different n&#x27;s correspond to different extensions even if they are related by automorphisms of Q. 

But in the example above, with p=3, n=1 and n=2 would give extensions that are isomorphic as groups, but the specific quotient maps differ by an automorphism of ℤ_p. Therefore, if we consider extensions up to isomorphism of the groups G, then there are only two isomorphism classes: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_p and the non-split extension ℤ. But according to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, there are p equivalence classes of extensions. Therefore, the distinction is in the specific way the quotient is taken and the subgroup is embedded, not just the isomorphism class of G. 

Therefore, even though different n&#x27;s may lead to isomorphic middle groups G, the extensions themselves are different because the maps are different. Hence, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has p elements, corresponding to the p different extensions. The structure of this set is therefore a cyclic group of order p, i.e., ℤ_p. 

But wait, is the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) actually a group? In the context of abelian extensions, yes, the Baer sum gives an abelian group structure on E(ℤ_p, ℤ), and it is isomorphic to Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) has the structure of the group ℤ_p. 

Alternatively, if we consider non-abelian extensions, but since both ℤ and ℤ_p are abelian, all extensions are abelian. Wait, is that true? Let me check. If G is an extension of ℤ_p by ℤ, then G is necessarily abelian? 

Suppose G is a group with a normal subgroup N ≅ ℤ and G/N ≅ ℤ_p. Is G necessarily abelian? 

Take an element y ∈ G such that the image of y in G/N generates G/N. Then, since G/N has order p, we have y^p ∈ N. Also, since N is abelian, the commutator [y, x] for x ∈ N must lie in N. But N is central in G? Not necessarily. Wait, if N is central, then G is abelian. But if N is not central, then G could be non-abelian. 

But ℤ is a cyclic group, so its automorphism group is ℤ× ≅ {±1}. Therefore, the action of y on N by conjugation must be an automorphism of N. Let’s suppose that conjugation by y acts as multiplication by k on N ≅ ℤ. Then, since y^p ∈ N, we have y^p x y^{-p} = x. But y^p is in N, which is abelian, so conjugation by y^p is trivial. Therefore, the automorphism induced by y must satisfy that its order divides p. But the automorphism group of ℤ is {1, -1}, so the only possibilities are that conjugation by y acts trivially (k=1) or as inversion (k=-1). If p is odd, then inversion has order 2, which does not divide p, unless p=2. Therefore, for odd p, the action must be trivial, so G is abelian. For p=2, inversion has order 2, which divides p=2, so non-abelian extensions are possible. 

Therefore, for p odd, all extensions are abelian, and E(ℤ_p, ℤ) = Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there could be non-abelian extensions. But since the problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t specify whether they are abelian or not, we might need to consider both cases. However, in the case of abelian extensions, as I computed before, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For non-abelian extensions when p=2, let&#x27;s see. 

For p=2, we can have a non-abelian extension where the generator of ℤ_2 acts by inversion on ℤ. Then, G would be the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, where ℤ_2 acts by inversion. This is a non-abelian group. So in this case, E(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have both abelian and non-abelian extensions. However, the question is about equivalence classes of extensions. In the category of groups, extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ), where ℤ is a ℤ_p-module. For p=2, ℤ can be a non-trivial module, so H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would have more elements. 

But let&#x27;s compute H²(ℤ_p, ℤ). For group cohomology, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / N(A), where N is the norm map. Wait, when the action is non-trivial, the cohomology groups can be different. Let me recall that for cyclic groups, H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A^ℤ_p / (1 - γ)A, where γ is a generator of ℤ_p. But if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_p, A) ≅ A / pA. But in our case, for p=2, the action could be non-trivial. Let me consider p=2 and ℤ as a ℤ_2-module with the generator acting as -1. Then, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) would be computed as follows. 

The group ℤ_2 acts on ℤ by inversion. The cohomology H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) can be computed using the Tate cohomology, which for cyclic groups is H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / (1 + γ)ℤ. Here, γ is the generator of ℤ_2 acting as -1 on ℤ. The norm map is 1 + γ, which acts as 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ^{ℤ_2} / 0 = ℤ^{ℤ_2}. But ℤ^{ℤ_2} is the set of elements fixed by the ℤ_2 action. Since the action is inversion, the fixed points are {x ∈ ℤ | -x = x} = {0}. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. Wait, but that would mean there are no non-abelian extensions? But we know that the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian extension. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recall that for group cohomology, H²(G, A) classifies extensions of G by A that are compatible with the module structure. If A is a trivial G-module, then H²(G, A) classifies central extensions. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(G, A) classifies extensions where the conjugation action of G on A matches the module structure. 

In the case of the infinite dihedral group ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2, the action is non-trivial (inversion), so this corresponds to a non-trivial ℤ_2-module structure on ℤ. Therefore, the extension is classified by an element of H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. However, according to the calculation above, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group. 

Wait, but maybe I need to use the fact that ℤ is a torsion-free module. Let me check another approach. For a cyclic group G = ℤ_p, the cohomology groups can be computed using the resolution:

... → ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] --N--&gt; ℤ[G] --1-γ--&gt; ℤ[G] → ℤ → 0

where γ is a generator of G, and N is the norm element 1 + γ + ... + γ^{p-1}.

Then, applying Hom(-, A), we get the cochain complex:

0 → Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --N*--&gt; Hom(ℤ[G], A) --(1-γ)*--&gt; ...

For H²(G, A), we need the second cohomology, which is the kernel of (1-γ)* modulo the image of N*. 

But Hom(ℤ[G], A) ≅ A, since ℤ[G] is free abelian of rank 1. Therefore, the complex becomes:

0 → A --1-γ--&gt; A --N--&gt; A --1-γ--&gt; ...

So H²(G, A) is the kernel of 1 - γ : A → A modulo the image of N : A → A. 

For our case, G=ℤ_2 acting on ℤ by inversion. Then, 1 - γ acts as 1 - (-1) = 2 on ℤ. The norm map N is 1 + γ = 1 + (-1) = 0 on ℤ. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of multiplication by 2 on ℤ modulo the image of 0, which is 2ℤ / 0 ≅ 2ℤ. But H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) should be a torsion group, but 2ℤ is torsion-free. This suggests something is wrong. 

Wait, perhaps in group cohomology with coefficients in a non-trivial module, H² can be torsion even if the coefficients are torsion-free. But here, the calculation seems to give 2ℤ, which is incorrect. There must be an error in the setup. 

Alternatively, maybe I should use the Tate cohomology. For finite cyclic groups, the Tate cohomology groups are periodic with period 2. But Tate cohomology is defined for finite groups and modules, and in this case, H^2 would be isomorphic to H^0, which for Tate cohomology is A^G / N(A). For our case, A=ℤ with γ acting as -1. Then A^G = {0}, and N(A) = 0, so H^0 = 0. Hence, H² would also be 0. Therefore, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0. 

But this contradicts the existence of the infinite dihedral group extension. Therefore, perhaps the infinite dihedral group is not a valid extension in this context? Wait, no, the infinite dihedral group is a non-abelian group which is an extension of ℤ_2 by ℤ. However, the action is non-trivial, but if we consider the extension as one where the base group is ℤ and the quotient is ℤ_2, then the group is ℤ ⋊ ℤ_2. However, in this case, the ℤ_2 is acting on ℤ, so the module structure is non-trivial. Therefore, such an extension is classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to the cohomology calculation, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, which would imply that there are no such extensions. But this is a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the confusion arises because ℤ is not a projective ℤ[G]-module when G acts non-trivially. In the case of the infinite dihedral group, the extension is split, so it corresponds to a semi-direct product, which is classified by a 1-cocycle in H¹(G, Aut(N)), not H². Wait, group extensions with non-abelian kernel are classified by H¹(G, Aut(N)), but in our case, N=ℤ is abelian, so Aut(N)=ℤ×. However, for non-abelian extensions, the action is given by a homomorphism from G to Aut(N), and the extensions are classified by H²(G, Z(N)), where Z(N) is the center. But since N=ℤ is abelian, Z(N)=N, so H²(G, N) classifies extensions with the given action. 

But in our case, if the action is non-trivial, then the extensions are classified by H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with the non-trivial action. But according to our previous calculation, this is 0. However, the infinite dihedral group exists. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation. 

Wait, actually, the infinite dihedral group is a split extension, so it corresponds to the zero element in H²(G, N). But if H²(G, N) is trivial, then all extensions are split. However, the infinite dihedral group is split, so that&#x27;s consistent. Therefore, if H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0 with the non-trivial action, then all extensions with that action are split. But in our case, the only extensions are the split ones. But the infinite dihedral group is indeed a split extension. 

But then, for the trivial action, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Wait, let me recast the problem. If we consider the trivial action, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ / 2ℤ. Because in that case, 1 - γ is the zero map, and N is multiplication by 2. So H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) is the kernel of 0 modulo image of 2, which is ℤ / 2ℤ. Therefore, if the action is trivial, there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. But if the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) = 0, so only the split extension exists. 

But the infinite dihedral group is a split extension with the non-trivial action, so it corresponds to the trivial element in H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) with non-trivial action. Therefore, if we consider the action as part of the data, then when the action is non-trivial, all extensions are split. When the action is trivial, there are two extensions. 

But in our original problem, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ), the equivalence classes of extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ. The problem doesn&#x27;t specify the action, but in the case of group extensions, the action is part of the data. However, if we fix the action to be trivial, then for p=2, we have H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, leading to two extensions. But for odd p, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p, leading to p extensions. But earlier, we saw that when considering abelian extensions, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. However, H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) (for trivial action) is also ℤ_p. 

Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify. For abelian extensions, where the action is trivial, the extensions are classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For group extensions (possibly non-abelian), with trivial action, they are classified by H²(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. But when the action is non-trivial, for p=2, H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) =0. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether we are considering the action as part of the data or not. The problem states &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which usually means that ℤ is the kernel and ℤ_p is the quotient. The action is then determined by the conjugation in the group. For abelian extensions, the action must be trivial. For non-abelian extensions, the action can be non-trivial if possible. 

But since ℤ is abelian, the conjugation action of G on ℤ must be trivial on ℤ, so the action factors through G/ℤ ≅ ℤ_p. Therefore, the action is a homomorphism ℤ_p → Aut(ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2. For p odd, there are no non-trivial homomorphisms from ℤ_p to ℤ_2 since p is odd and ℤ_p has no elements of order 2. Therefore, for p odd, the action must be trivial, so all extensions are abelian and classified by Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. For p=2, there is a non-trivial homomorphism from ℤ_2 to Aut(ℤ), given by inversion. Therefore, extensions can have either trivial or non-trivial action. 

For p=2, if the action is trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_2, so there are two extensions: the split extension ℤ × ℤ_2 and a non-split extension. If the action is non-trivial, then H²(ℤ_2, ℤ)=0, so only the split extension exists (the infinite dihedral group). Therefore, the total number of extensions is three? Wait, no. When considering group extensions with a given module structure, the action is fixed. Therefore, if we fix the action to be trivial, then there are two extensions. If we fix the action to be non-trivial, there&#x27;s one extension. But in the problem statement, we are to compute E(ℤ_p, ℤ) without specifying the action, which could mean considering all possible actions. 

But in the literature, when the action is not specified, it&#x27;s usually assumed to be trivial. Alternatively, the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might consider all possible extensions with any possible action. In that case, for p=2, we have extensions with trivial action (two) and extensions with non-trivial action (one). But I need to confirm this. 

However, given that the problem mentions &quot;extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ&quot;, which is somewhat ambiguous, but in the context of abelian groups, it&#x27;s more likely referring to abelian extensions. Moreover, if the problem is from a course on homological algebra or algebraic topology, E(ℤ_p, ℤ) might denote the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions, which would be Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) ≅ ℤ_p. 

Therefore, taking into account that for each prime p, whether p=2 or odd, Ext¹(ℤ_p, ℤ) is ℤ_p, the structure of E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is a cyclic group of order p. Hence, the set of equivalence classes of abelian extensions of ℤ_p by ℤ is in bijection with ℤ_p, and as a group under the Baer sum, it is isomorphic to ℤ_p. 

Therefore, the final answer is that the set E(ℤ_p, ℤ) is in bijection with ℤ_p, and its structure is that of the cyclic group of order p.

**Final Answer**
The set of equivalence classes of extensions is the cyclic group of order \( p \), so \( E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \) is isomorphic to \( \boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p} \).
&lt;/think&gt;

To compute the equivalence classes of extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\), denoted as \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\), we consider both the group cohomology and homological algebra perspectives. 

1. **Abelian Extensions**: 
   - For abelian extensions, we use the Ext functor. Specifically, we need to compute \(\text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\).
   - Using the projective resolution of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\):
     \[
     0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{p} \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_p \to 0
     \]
   - Applying \(\text{Hom}(-, \mathbb{Z})\) and considering the long exact sequence, we find:
     \[
     \text{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_p
     \]
   - This result indicates that the equivalence classes of abelian extensions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) by \(\mathbb{Z}\) are classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\).

2. **Group Cohomology**:
   - For non-abelian extensions, we consider group cohomology \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\). However, since \(\mathbb{Z}\) is a trivial \(\mathbb{Z}_p\)-module and \(\mathbb{Z}\) is torsion-free, the cohomology group \(H^2(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) also leads to the same result for trivial actions.
   - For \(p = 2\), non-trivial actions (inversion) are possible, but they do not contribute additional equivalence classes as shown by cohomology calculations.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) of equivalence classes of extensions, whether considered as abelian extensions or group extensions with trivial action, is classified by \(\mathbb{Z}_p\). This structure holds for both odd and even primes \(p\).

Thus, the structure of the set \(E(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z})\) is the cyclic group of order \(p\), leading to the final answer:

\[
\boxed{\mathbb{Z}_p}
