Reference Answer: You get a digit $0$ on the end of a number whenever it has a factor of $10$, so the question is really asking, how many $10$s are in the prime factorization of $1000!$. Since $10=2\cdot5$, we need to count how many of each there are. We&#x27;re going to have more $2$s than $5$s, so we actually only need to count how many times $5$ appears in the prime factorization.

To count how many times a number is divisible by $5$, we divide $1000$ by $5$ to get $200$. Each of those two hundred numbers has a factor of $5$.

Next, how many of the numbers are divisible by $5^2=25$? Dividing $1000$ by $25$, we get $40$. Each of them has two factors of $5$. We&#x27;ve already counted one of them for each number, so for these forty multiples of $25$, we need to add a factor for each to our count.

Next, we need to look at numbers that have $5^3=125$ in them. Eight of our numbers are divisible by $125$, so we count $8$ more factors of $5$.

Finally, we look at $5^4=625$. There is only one number among $1$ through $1000$ divisible by $625$, and that number is $625$, so we only need to count one more factor of $5$. Since $5^5$ is too big, we can stop here.

This gives a total of $200+40+8+1=249$ factors of $5$ in $1000!$, so it has $\boxed{249}$ zeroes on the end.          </p>

Next, how many of the numbers are divisible by $5^2=25$? Dividing $1000$ by $25$, we get $40$. Each of them has two factors of $5$. We&#x27;ve already counted one of them for each number, so for these forty multiples of $25$, we need to add a factor for each to our count.

Next, we need to look at numbers that have $5^3=125$ in them. Eight of our numbers are divisible by $125$, so we count $8$ more factors of $5$.

Finally, we look at $5^4=625$. There is only one number among $1$ through $1000$ divisible by $625$, and that number is $625$, so we only need to count one more factor of $5$. Since $5^5$ is too big, we can stop here.

This gives a total of $200+40+8+1=249$ factors of $5$ in $1000!$, so it has $\boxed{249}$ zeroes on the end.          </p>

Reference Answer: You get a digit $0$ on the end of a number whenever it has a factor of $10$, so the question is really asking, how many $10$s are in the prime factorization of $1000!$.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First off, since n is going to infinity, the floor(n/2) is going to be roughly n/2. So maybe I can approximate the upper limit as n/2 instead of floor(n/2) for large n? I think that should be okay because as n becomes very large, the difference between floor(n/2) and n/2 becomes negligible relative to n. So that simplifies the problem a bit.

So, now the expression is approximately (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to n/2 of cos(kπ/n). Wait, but n is going to infinity, so maybe I can turn this sum into a Riemann sum? Because Riemann sums involve sums that approximate integrals when the number of terms goes to infinity, and here we have a sum with terms that could be seen as function evaluations at points spaced by 1/n apart. Let me check.

Let&#x27;s consider the sum (1/n) * sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). If I let x_k = k/n, then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(x_k π) * (1/n). So x_k ranges from 1/n to (n/2)/n = 1/2 as k goes from 1 to n/2. As n approaches infinity, the spacing between consecutive x_k&#x27;s is 1/n, which tends to zero. Therefore, this sum should approximate the integral of cos(πx) from x=0 to x=1/2.

Wait, but the sum starts at k=1, so x starts at 1/n, which approaches 0 as n becomes large. So the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx. Then the limit should be equal to that integral. Let me verify this intuition.

The Riemann sum for a function f(x) over [a, b] is given by sum_{k=1}^n f(a + kΔx) Δx, where Δx = (b - a)/n. In our case, if we consider the interval from 0 to 1/2, then Δx would be (1/2 - 0)/n = 1/(2n), but our sum is (1/n) sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). Wait, maybe I need to adjust variables here.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s make a substitution. Let’s set x = k/n, so when k=1, x=1/n, and when k= n/2, x=1/2. The spacing between consecutive x’s is 1/n. So the sum is sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(πx) * (1/n). This is like a Riemann sum with sample points at the right endpoints of each subinterval. But the interval of integration would be from x=0 to x=1/2. However, the first term is at x=1/n, so as n approaches infinity, the difference between the sum and the integral from 0 to 1/2 would go to zero. Therefore, the limit should indeed be the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx.

Let me compute that integral. The integral of cos(πx) dx is (1/π) sin(πx) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 1/2, we get (1/π)[sin(π*(1/2)) - sin(0)] = (1/π)[sin(π/2) - 0] = (1/π)(1) = 1/π. Therefore, the limit should be 1/π. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check the setup. The original problem is the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n), multiplied by 1/n. As n approaches infinity, floor(n/2) is approximately n/2, but for even and odd n, floor(n/2) is either exactly n/2 or (n-1)/2. However, as n becomes large, the difference between n/2 and (n-1)/2 is negligible. So treating the upper limit as n/2 is acceptable. 

But to be precise, when n is even, floor(n/2) = n/2, and when n is odd, floor(n/2) = (n-1)/2. However, in both cases, as n tends to infinity, floor(n/2)/n tends to 1/2. So whether we use n/2 or (n-1)/2, the upper limit of the sum divided by n approaches 1/2. Therefore, the approximation as a Riemann sum over the interval [0, 1/2] should hold.

Therefore, the original limit is equal to the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx, which is 1/π. So the answer should be 1/π, which is approximately 0.318... But let me confirm once again.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the sum explicitly and then take the limit. However, that might be more complicated. Let me recall that the sum of cosines can sometimes be expressed in closed form. The formula for the sum of cos(kθ) from k=1 to m is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m+1)θ/2). Let me check that formula.

Yes, the formula for the sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2). So maybe I can use this formula here. Let&#x27;s set θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s first handle the case when n is even. Let n = 2m. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Applying the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)) = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2)

Wait, maybe let me plug into the formula correctly. The formula is:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) = [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So here θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s take n even first: n = 2m. Then θ = π/(2m), and the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Then applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2). Wait, no, that&#x27;s not correct. Let me be precise.

Wait, in the formula, θ is the common difference. So in our case, θ = π/n. For n even, m = n/2. So the sum is from k=1 to m of cos(kθ) where θ = π/n. Therefore, applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

Substituting m = n/2, θ = π/n:

Sum = [sin((n/2)(π/n)/2) / sin((π/n)/2)] * cos(((n/2 + 1)(π/n))/2)

Simplify each part:

First, mθ/2 = (n/2)(π/n)/2 = (π/2)/2 = π/4

Denominator sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2n))

Second part: ((m + 1)θ)/2 = ((n/2 + 1)π/n)/2 = (π/2 + π/n)/2 = π/4 + π/(2n)

Therefore, Sum = [sin(π/4)/sin(π/(2n))] * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

So, sin(π/4) is √2/2, so:

Sum = (√2/2) / sin(π/(2n)) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

Therefore, the original expression is (1/n) * Sum = (1/n) * [√2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))]

Now, as n approaches infinity, π/(2n) approaches 0, so sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n). Therefore, sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n) - (π/(2n))^3/6 + ... So, 1/sin(π/(2n)) ≈ 2n/π (1 + (π^2)/(24n^2) + ... )

Therefore, √2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) ≈ √2/(2) * (2n/π) (1 + ...) = √2 n / π (1 + ...)

Then, cos(π/4 + π/(2n)) = cos(π/4)cos(π/(2n)) - sin(π/4)sin(π/(2n)) ≈ (√2/2)(1 - (π/(2n))^2/2) - (√2/2)(π/(2n)) ≈ √2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n) - higher order terms.

Multiplying these together:

[√2 n / π] * [√2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n)] ≈ (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) - (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) * π/(2n) + ... = (2n / (2π)) - (2n / (2π)) * π/(2n) + ... = n/π - (1/2) + ...

Then, multiplying by (1/n):

(1/n) * [n/π - 1/2 + ...] = 1/π - 1/(2n) + ... 

So as n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/π. So that checks out for even n.

Now, let&#x27;s check when n is odd. Let n = 2m + 1. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m + 1)). Applying the same formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2), where θ = π/(2m + 1)

So, substituting:

Sum = [sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) / sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ] * cos( (m + 1) * π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Simplify:

First term in numerator: sin(mπ/(2(2m + 1))) = sin( (2m^2 + m)π / (2(2m + 1)) )? Wait, no, wait: m * π / (2(2m + 1)) is just mπ/(2(2m + 1)).

Similarly, denominator: sin(π/(2(2m + 1)))

Second term: cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Let me see if as m becomes large (since n = 2m + 1 approaches infinity), we can approximate this.

Let me set m large, so n = 2m + 1 ≈ 2m. Then θ = π/(2m + 1) ≈ π/(2m). Let&#x27;s see:

Numerator: sin(mθ/2) = sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ sin(m * π/(4m)) = sin(π/4) = √2/2.

Denominator: sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ π/(4m).

Similarly, the cosine term: cos( (m + 1)θ/2 ) = cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ cos( (m)π/(4m) ) = cos(π/4) = √2/2.

Therefore, Sum ≈ [√2/2 / (π/(4m))] * √2/2 = [ (√2/2) * (4m/π) ) ] * (√2/2 ) = ( (4m/π) * (√2/2) ) * (√2/2 ) = (4m/π) * (2/4) ) = (4m/π) * (1/2) ) = 2m/π.

Then, since n ≈ 2m, m ≈ n/2, so Sum ≈ 2*(n/2)/π = n/π. Therefore, (1/n)*Sum ≈ 1/π, same as before. Therefore, whether n is even or odd, as n becomes large, the sum divided by n tends to 1/π. Therefore, the limit is 1/π. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 1/π.

But just to be thorough, let me check with specific large n. Let&#x27;s take n = 1000 (even). Then floor(n/2) = 500. The sum is sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000). Then (1/1000)*sum ≈ integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx = 1/π ≈ 0.318. Let me compute the sum numerically. 

Alternatively, using the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000) = [sin(500*(π/1000)/2)/sin(π/(2000))] * cos((500 + 1)*(π/1000)/2)

Wait, using the formula again. Let me compute this. So m = 500, θ = π/1000.

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So mθ/2 = 500*(π/1000)/2 = π/4, same as before. sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071.

sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2000)) ≈ π/2000 - (π/2000)^3/6. Let&#x27;s compute sin(π/2000): π ≈ 3.1416, so π/2000 ≈ 0.0015708. sin(0.0015708) ≈ 0.0015708 - (0.0015708)^3/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - (3.875e-9)/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - 6.458e-10 ≈ 0.0015708. So sin(π/2000) ≈ 0.0015708.

Then, [sin(π/4)/sin(π/2000)] ≈ (0.7071)/(0.0015708) ≈ 450. 

Then, cos((m + 1)θ/2) = cos(501*(π/1000)/2) = cos(501π/2000). 501π/2000 ≈ (500π + π)/2000 = π/4 + π/2000 ≈ 0.7854 + 0.0015708 ≈ 0.7870 radians. cos(0.7870) ≈ 0.7071 (since π/4 is 0.7854, cos(π/4) ≈ 0.7071). So cos(501π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - sin(π/4)*(π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - 0.7071*0.0015708 ≈ 0.7071 - 0.001111 ≈ 0.7060.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7.

Then, (1/1000)*Sum ≈ 0.3177. And 1/π ≈ 0.3183, so that&#x27;s very close. So that checks out.

Similarly, for n = 1001 (odd), floor(n/2) = 500. Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1001). Let&#x27;s use the formula again.

θ = π/1001, m = 500.

Sum = [sin(500*(π/1001)/2)/sin(π/(2002))] * cos(501*(π/1001)/2)

Compute:

500*(π/1001)/2 ≈ (500/1001)*(π/2) ≈ 0.4995*(1.5708) ≈ 0.7841 radians.

sin(0.7841) ≈ sin(π/4 + a little) ≈ 0.7071 + something. Wait, 0.7841 radians is approximately 45 degrees + 0.7841 - 0.7854 ≈ 45 degrees - 0.0013 radians, so very close to π/4. So sin(0.7841) ≈ 0.7071.

Similarly, sin(π/(2002)) ≈ π/2002 ≈ 0.001570. 

Then, [sin(0.7841)/sin(0.001570)] ≈ 0.7071 / 0.001570 ≈ 450. 

Then, cos(501*(π/1001)/2) = cos(501π/2002). 501/2002 ≈ 0.25025. 0.25025*π ≈ 0.786 radians. So cos(0.786) ≈ 0.7060, similar to before.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7. Then (1/1001)*317.7 ≈ 0.3175, again close to 1/π ≈ 0.3183. So that also checks out.

Therefore, both even and odd cases give results approaching 1/π. So I can be confident that the limit is indeed 1/π. 

Just to recap, the key idea was recognizing that the given sum is a Riemann sum approximating the integral of cos(πx) from 0 to 1/2, which evaluates to 1/π. Additionally, verifying with the summation formula for cosines and checking specific numerical cases supported this conclusion. Therefore, the final answer is 1/π.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{\pi}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\; \frac{1}{n}\;\sum_{k=1}^{\Big\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\Big\rfloor} \cos\Big(\frac{k\pi}{n}\Big), \] we recognize that as \( n \) approaches infinity, the upper limit \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \) can be approximated by \( \frac{n}{2} \). This allows us to consider the sum as a Riemann sum approximation of an integral.

The sum \( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) can be approximated by the integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \). This is because the terms \( \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) with \( x_k = \frac{k}{n} \) approximate the function \( \cos(\pi x) \) over the interval \( [0, \frac{1}{2}] \) with spacing \( \frac{1}{n} \).

The integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \) is computed as follows:
\[
\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} \cos(\pi x) \, dx = \left[ \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi} \right]_0^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - \sin(0)}{\pi} = \frac{1 - 0}{\pi} = \frac{1}{\\pi}.
\]

Thus, the limit is evaluated to be \( \frac{1}{\pi} \).

\[

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First off, since n is going to infinity, the floor(n/2) is going to be roughly n/2. So maybe I can approximate the upper limit as n/2 instead of floor(n/2) for large n? I think that should be okay because as n becomes very large, the difference between floor(n/2) and n/2 becomes negligible relative to n. So that simplifies the problem a bit.

So, now the expression is approximately (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to n/2 of cos(kπ/n). Wait, but n is going to infinity, so maybe I can turn this sum into a Riemann sum? Because Riemann sums involve sums that approximate integrals when the number of terms goes to infinity, and here we have a sum with terms that could be seen as function evaluations at points spaced by 1/n apart. Let me check.

Let&#x27;s consider the sum (1/n) * sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). If I let x_k = k/n, then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(x_k π) * (1/n). So x_k ranges from 1/n to (n/2)/n = 1/2 as k goes from 1 to n/2. As n approaches infinity, the spacing between consecutive x_k&#x27;s is 1/n, which tends to zero. Therefore, this sum should approximate the integral of cos(πx) from x=0 to x=1/2.

Wait, but the sum starts at k=1, so x starts at 1/n, which approaches 0 as n becomes large. So the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx. Then the limit should be equal to that integral. Let me verify this intuition.

The Riemann sum for a function f(x) over [a, b] is given by sum_{k=1}^n f(a + kΔx) Δx, where Δx = (b - a)/n. In our case, if we consider the interval from 0 to 1/2, then Δx would be (1/2 - 0)/n = 1/(2n), but our sum is (1/n) sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). Wait, maybe I need to adjust variables here.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s make a substitution. Let’s set x = k/n, so when k=1, x=1/n, and when k= n/2, x=1/2. The spacing between consecutive x’s is 1/n. So the sum is sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(πx) * (1/n). This is like a Riemann sum with sample points at the right endpoints of each subinterval. But the interval of integration would be from x=0 to x=1/2. However, the first term is at x=1/n, so as n approaches infinity, the difference between the sum and the integral from 0 to 1/2 would go to zero. Therefore, the limit should indeed be the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx.

Let me compute that integral. The integral of cos(πx) dx is (1/π) sin(πx) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 1/2, we get (1/π)[sin(π*(1/2)) - sin(0)] = (1/π)[sin(π/2) - 0] = (1/π)(1) = 1/π. Therefore, the limit should be 1/π. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check the setup. The original problem is the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n), multiplied by 1/n. As n approaches infinity, floor(n/2) is approximately n/2, but for even and odd n, floor(n/2) is either exactly n/2 or (n-1)/2. However, as n becomes large, the difference between n/2 and (n-1)/2 is negligible. So treating the upper limit as n/2 is acceptable. 

But to be precise, when n is even, floor(n/2) = n/2, and when n is odd, floor(n/2) = (n-1)/2. However, in both cases, as n tends to infinity, floor(n/2)/n tends to 1/2. So whether we use n/2 or (n-1)/2, the upper limit of the sum divided by n approaches 1/2. Therefore, the approximation as a Riemann sum over the interval [0, 1/2] should hold.

Therefore, the original limit is equal to the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx, which is 1/π. So the answer should be 1/π, which is approximately 0.318... But let me confirm once again.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the sum explicitly and then take the limit. However, that might be more complicated. Let me recall that the sum of cosines can sometimes be expressed in closed form. The formula for the sum of cos(kθ) from k=1 to m is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m+1)θ/2). Let me check that formula.

Yes, the formula for the sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2). So maybe I can use this formula here. Let&#x27;s set θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s first handle the case when n is even. Let n = 2m. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Applying the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)) = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2)

Wait, maybe let me plug into the formula correctly. The formula is:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) = [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So here θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s take n even first: n = 2m. Then θ = π/(2m), and the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Then applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2). Wait, no, that&#x27;s not correct. Let me be precise.

Wait, in the formula, θ is the common difference. So in our case, θ = π/n. For n even, m = n/2. So the sum is from k=1 to m of cos(kθ) where θ = π/n. Therefore, applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

Substituting m = n/2, θ = π/n:

Sum = [sin((n/2)(π/n)/2) / sin((π/n)/2)] * cos(((n/2 + 1)(π/n))/2)

Simplify each part:

First, mθ/2 = (n/2)(π/n)/2 = (π/2)/2 = π/4

Denominator sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2n))

Second part: ((m + 1)θ)/2 = ((n/2 + 1)π/n)/2 = (π/2 + π/n)/2 = π/4 + π/(2n)

Therefore, Sum = [sin(π/4)/sin(π/(2n))] * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

So, sin(π/4) is √2/2, so:

Sum = (√2/2) / sin(π/(2n)) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

Therefore, the original expression is (1/n) * Sum = (1/n) * [√2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))]

Now, as n approaches infinity, π/(2n) approaches 0, so sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n). Therefore, sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n) - (π/(2n))^3/6 + ... So, 1/sin(π/(2n)) ≈ 2n/π (1 + (π^2)/(24n^2) + ... )

Therefore, √2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) ≈ √2/(2) * (2n/π) (1 + ...) = √2 n / π (1 + ...)

Then, cos(π/4 + π/(2n)) = cos(π/4)cos(π/(2n)) - sin(π/4)sin(π/(2n)) ≈ (√2/2)(1 - (π/(2n))^2/2) - (√2/2)(π/(2n)) ≈ √2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n) - higher order terms.

Multiplying these together:

[√2 n / π] * [√2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n)] ≈ (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) - (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) * π/(2n) + ... = (2n / (2π)) - (2n / (2π)) * π/(2n) + ... = n/π - (1/2) + ...

Then, multiplying by (1/n):

(1/n) * [n/π - 1/2 + ...] = 1/π - 1/(2n) + ... 

So as n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/π. So that checks out for even n.

Now, let&#x27;s check when n is odd. Let n = 2m + 1. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m + 1)). Applying the same formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2), where θ = π/(2m + 1)

So, substituting:

Sum = [sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) / sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ] * cos( (m + 1) * π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Simplify:

First term in numerator: sin(mπ/(2(2m + 1))) = sin( (2m^2 + m)π / (2(2m + 1)) )? Wait, no, wait: m * π / (2(2m + 1)) is just mπ/(2(2m + 1)).

Similarly, denominator: sin(π/(2(2m + 1)))

Second term: cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Let me see if as m becomes large (since n = 2m + 1 approaches infinity), we can approximate this.

Let me set m large, so n = 2m + 1 ≈ 2m. Then θ = π/(2m + 1) ≈ π/(2m). Let&#x27;s see:

Numerator: sin(mθ/2) = sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ sin(m * π/(4m)) = sin(π/4) = √2/2.

Denominator: sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ π/(4m).

Similarly, the cosine term: cos( (m + 1)θ/2 ) = cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ cos( (m)π/(4m) ) = cos(π/4) = √2/2.

Therefore, Sum ≈ [√2/2 / (π/(4m))] * √2/2 = [ (√2/2) * (4m/π) ) ] * (√2/2 ) = ( (4m/π) * (√2/2) ) * (√2/2 ) = (4m/π) * (2/4) ) = (4m/π) * (1/2) ) = 2m/π.

Then, since n ≈ 2m, m ≈ n/2, so Sum ≈ 2*(n/2)/π = n/π. Therefore, (1/n)*Sum ≈ 1/π, same as before. Therefore, whether n is even or odd, as n becomes large, the sum divided by n tends to 1/π. Therefore, the limit is 1/π. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 1/π.

But just to be thorough, let me check with specific large n. Let&#x27;s take n = 1000 (even). Then floor(n/2) = 500. The sum is sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000). Then (1/1000)*sum ≈ integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx = 1/π ≈ 0.318. Let me compute the sum numerically. 

Alternatively, using the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000) = [sin(500*(π/1000)/2)/sin(π/(2000))] * cos((500 + 1)*(π/1000)/2)

Wait, using the formula again. Let me compute this. So m = 500, θ = π/1000.

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So mθ/2 = 500*(π/1000)/2 = π/4, same as before. sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071.

sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2000)) ≈ π/2000 - (π/2000)^3/6. Let&#x27;s compute sin(π/2000): π ≈ 3.1416, so π/2000 ≈ 0.0015708. sin(0.0015708) ≈ 0.0015708 - (0.0015708)^3/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - (3.875e-9)/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - 6.458e-10 ≈ 0.0015708. So sin(π/2000) ≈ 0.0015708.

Then, [sin(π/4)/sin(π/2000)] ≈ (0.7071)/(0.0015708) ≈ 450. 

Then, cos((m + 1)θ/2) = cos(501*(π/1000)/2) = cos(501π/2000). 501π/2000 ≈ (500π + π)/2000 = π/4 + π/2000 ≈ 0.7854 + 0.0015708 ≈ 0.7870 radians. cos(0.7870) ≈ 0.7071 (since π/4 is 0.7854, cos(π/4) ≈ 0.7071). So cos(501π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - sin(π/4)*(π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - 0.7071*0.0015708 ≈ 0.7071 - 0.001111 ≈ 0.7060.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7.

Then, (1/1000)*Sum ≈ 0.3177. And 1/π ≈ 0.3183, so that&#x27;s very close. So that checks out.

Similarly, for n = 1001 (odd), floor(n/2) = 500. Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1001). Let&#x27;s use the formula again.

θ = π/1001, m = 500.

Sum = [sin(500*(π/1001)/2)/sin(π/(2002))] * cos(501*(π/1001)/2)

Compute:

500*(π/1001)/2 ≈ (500/1001)*(π/2) ≈ 0.4995*(1.5708) ≈ 0.7841 radians.

sin(0.7841) ≈ sin(π/4 + a little) ≈ 0.7071 + something. Wait, 0.7841 radians is approximately 45 degrees + 0.7841 - 0.7854 ≈ 45 degrees - 0.0013 radians, so very close to π/4. So sin(0.7841) ≈ 0.7071.

Similarly, sin(π/(2002)) ≈ π/2002 ≈ 0.001570. 

Then, [sin(0.7841)/sin(0.001570)] ≈ 0.7071 / 0.001570 ≈ 450. 

Then, cos(501*(π/1001)/2) = cos(501π/2002). 501/2002 ≈ 0.25025. 0.25025*π ≈ 0.786 radians. So cos(0.786) ≈ 0.7060, similar to before.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7. Then (1/1001)*317.7 ≈ 0.3175, again close to 1/π ≈ 0.3183. So that also checks out.

Therefore, both even and odd cases give results approaching 1/π. So I can be confident that the limit is indeed 1/π. 

Just to recap, the key idea was recognizing that the given sum is a Riemann sum approximating the integral of cos(πx) from 0 to 1/2, which evaluates to 1/π. Additionally, verifying with the summation formula for cosines and checking specific numerical cases supported this conclusion. Therefore, the final answer is 1/π.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{\pi}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\; \frac{1}{n}\;\sum_{k=1}^{\Big\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\Big\rfloor} \cos\Big(\frac{k\pi}{n}\Big), \] we recognize that as \( n \) approaches infinity, the upper limit \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \) can be approximated by \( \frac{n}{2} \). This allows us to consider the sum as a Riemann sum approximation of an integral.

The sum \( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) can be approximated by the integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \). This is because the terms \( \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) with \( x_k = \frac{k}{n} \) approximate the function \( \cos(\pi x) \) over the interval \( [0, \frac{1}{2}] \) with spacing \( \frac{1}{n} \).

The integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \) is computed as follows:
\[
\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} \cos(\pi x) \, dx = \left[ \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi} \right]_0^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - \sin(0)}{\pi} = \frac{1 - 0}{\pi} = \frac{1}{\\pi}.
\]

Thus, the limit is evaluated to be \( \frac{1}{\pi} \).

So x_k ranges from 1/n to (n/2)/n = 1/2 as k goes from 1 to n/2. As n approaches infinity, the spacing between consecutive x_k&#x27;s is 1/n, which tends to zero. Therefore, this sum should approximate the integral of cos(πx) from x=0 to x=1/2.

Wait, but the sum starts at k=1, so x starts at 1/n, which approaches 0 as n becomes large. So the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx. Then the limit should be equal to that integral. Let me verify this intuition.

The Riemann sum for a function f(x) over [a, b] is given by sum_{k=1}^n f(a + kΔx) Δx, where Δx = (b - a)/n. In our case, if we consider the interval from 0 to 1/2, then Δx would be (1/2 - 0)/n = 1/(2n), but our sum is (1/n) sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). Wait, maybe I need to adjust variables here.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s make a substitution. Let’s set x = k/n, so when k=1, x=1/n, and when k= n/2, x=1/2. The spacing between consecutive x’s is 1/n. So the sum is sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(πx) * (1/n). This is like a Riemann sum with sample points at the right endpoints of each subinterval. But the interval of integration would be from x=0 to x=1/2. However, the first term is at x=1/n, so as n approaches infinity, the difference between the sum and the integral from 0 to 1/2 would go to zero. Therefore, the limit should indeed be the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx.

Let me compute that integral. The integral of cos(πx) dx is (1/π) sin(πx) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 1/2, we get (1/π)[sin(π*(1/2)) - sin(0)] = (1/π)[sin(π/2) - 0] = (1/π)(1) = 1/π. Therefore, the limit should be 1/π. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check the setup. The original problem is the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n), multiplied by 1/n. As n approaches infinity, floor(n/2) is approximately n/2, but for even and odd n, floor(n/2) is either exactly n/2 or (n-1)/2. However, as n becomes large, the difference between n/2 and (n-1)/2 is negligible. So treating the upper limit as n/2 is acceptable. 

But to be precise, when n is even, floor(n/2) = n/2, and when n is odd, floor(n/2) = (n-1)/2. However, in both cases, as n tends to infinity, floor(n/2)/n tends to 1/2. So whether we use n/2 or (n-1)/2, the upper limit of the sum divided by n approaches 1/2. Therefore, the approximation as a Riemann sum over the interval [0, 1/2] should hold.

Therefore, the original limit is equal to the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx, which is 1/π. So the answer should be 1/π, which is approximately 0.318... But let me confirm once again.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the sum explicitly and then take the limit. However, that might be more complicated. Let me recall that the sum of cosines can sometimes be expressed in closed form. The formula for the sum of cos(kθ) from k=1 to m is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m+1)θ/2). Let me check that formula.

Yes, the formula for the sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2). So maybe I can use this formula here. Let&#x27;s set θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s first handle the case when n is even. Let n = 2m. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Applying the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)) = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2)

Wait, maybe let me plug into the formula correctly. The formula is:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) = [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So here θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s take n even first: n = 2m. Then θ = π/(2m), and the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Then applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2). Wait, no, that&#x27;s not correct. Let me be precise.

Wait, in the formula, θ is the common difference. So in our case, θ = π/n. For n even, m = n/2. So the sum is from k=1 to m of cos(kθ) where θ = π/n. Therefore, applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

Substituting m = n/2, θ = π/n:

Sum = [sin((n/2)(π/n)/2) / sin((π/n)/2)] * cos(((n/2 + 1)(π/n))/2)

Simplify each part:

First, mθ/2 = (n/2)(π/n)/2 = (π/2)/2 = π/4

Denominator sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2n))

Second part: ((m + 1)θ)/2 = ((n/2 + 1)π/n)/2 = (π/2 + π/n)/2 = π/4 + π/(2n)

Therefore, Sum = [sin(π/4)/sin(π/(2n))] * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

So, sin(π/4) is √2/2, so:

Sum = (√2/2) / sin(π/(2n)) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

Therefore, the original expression is (1/n) * Sum = (1/n) * [√2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))]

Now, as n approaches infinity, π/(2n) approaches 0, so sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n). Therefore, sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n) - (π/(2n))^3/6 + ... So, 1/sin(π/(2n)) ≈ 2n/π (1 + (π^2)/(24n^2) + ... )

Therefore, √2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) ≈ √2/(2) * (2n/π) (1 + ...) = √2 n / π (1 + ...)

Then, cos(π/4 + π/(2n)) = cos(π/4)cos(π/(2n)) - sin(π/4)sin(π/(2n)) ≈ (√2/2)(1 - (π/(2n))^2/2) - (√2/2)(π/(2n)) ≈ √2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n) - higher order terms.

Multiplying these together:

[√2 n / π] * [√2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n)] ≈ (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) - (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) * π/(2n) + ... = (2n / (2π)) - (2n / (2π)) * π/(2n) + ... = n/π - (1/2) + ...

Then, multiplying by (1/n):

(1/n) * [n/π - 1/2 + ...] = 1/π - 1/(2n) + ... 

So as n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/π. So that checks out for even n.

Now, let&#x27;s check when n is odd. Let n = 2m + 1. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m + 1)). Applying the same formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2), where θ = π/(2m + 1)

So, substituting:

Sum = [sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) / sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ] * cos( (m + 1) * π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Simplify:

First term in numerator: sin(mπ/(2(2m + 1))) = sin( (2m^2 + m)π / (2(2m + 1)) )? Wait, no, wait: m * π / (2(2m + 1)) is just mπ/(2(2m + 1)).

Similarly, denominator: sin(π/(2(2m + 1)))

Second term: cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Let me see if as m becomes large (since n = 2m + 1 approaches infinity), we can approximate this.

Let me set m large, so n = 2m + 1 ≈ 2m. Then θ = π/(2m + 1) ≈ π/(2m). Let&#x27;s see:

Numerator: sin(mθ/2) = sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ sin(m * π/(4m)) = sin(π/4) = √2/2.

Denominator: sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ π/(4m).

Similarly, the cosine term: cos( (m + 1)θ/2 ) = cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ cos( (m)π/(4m) ) = cos(π/4) = √2/2.

Therefore, Sum ≈ [√2/2 / (π/(4m))] * √2/2 = [ (√2/2) * (4m/π) ) ] * (√2/2 ) = ( (4m/π) * (√2/2) ) * (√2/2 ) = (4m/π) * (2/4) ) = (4m/π) * (1/2) ) = 2m/π.

Then, since n ≈ 2m, m ≈ n/2, so Sum ≈ 2*(n/2)/π = n/π. Therefore, (1/n)*Sum ≈ 1/π, same as before. Therefore, whether n is even or odd, as n becomes large, the sum divided by n tends to 1/π. Therefore, the limit is 1/π. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 1/π.

But just to be thorough, let me check with specific large n. Let&#x27;s take n = 1000 (even). Then floor(n/2) = 500. The sum is sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000). Then (1/1000)*sum ≈ integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx = 1/π ≈ 0.318. Let me compute the sum numerically. 

Alternatively, using the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000) = [sin(500*(π/1000)/2)/sin(π/(2000))] * cos((500 + 1)*(π/1000)/2)

Wait, using the formula again. Let me compute this. So m = 500, θ = π/1000.

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So mθ/2 = 500*(π/1000)/2 = π/4, same as before. sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071.

sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2000)) ≈ π/2000 - (π/2000)^3/6. Let&#x27;s compute sin(π/2000): π ≈ 3.1416, so π/2000 ≈ 0.0015708. sin(0.0015708) ≈ 0.0015708 - (0.0015708)^3/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - (3.875e-9)/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - 6.458e-10 ≈ 0.0015708. So sin(π/2000) ≈ 0.0015708.

Then, [sin(π/4)/sin(π/2000)] ≈ (0.7071)/(0.0015708) ≈ 450. 

Then, cos((m + 1)θ/2) = cos(501*(π/1000)/2) = cos(501π/2000). 501π/2000 ≈ (500π + π)/2000 = π/4 + π/2000 ≈ 0.7854 + 0.0015708 ≈ 0.7870 radians. cos(0.7870) ≈ 0.7071 (since π/4 is 0.7854, cos(π/4) ≈ 0.7071). So cos(501π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - sin(π/4)*(π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - 0.7071*0.0015708 ≈ 0.7071 - 0.001111 ≈ 0.7060.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7.

Then, (1/1000)*Sum ≈ 0.3177. And 1/π ≈ 0.3183, so that&#x27;s very close. So that checks out.

Similarly, for n = 1001 (odd), floor(n/2) = 500. Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1001). Let&#x27;s use the formula again.

θ = π/1001, m = 500.

Sum = [sin(500*(π/1001)/2)/sin(π/(2002))] * cos(501*(π/1001)/2)

Compute:

500*(π/1001)/2 ≈ (500/1001)*(π/2) ≈ 0.4995*(1.5708) ≈ 0.7841 radians.

sin(0.7841) ≈ sin(π/4 + a little) ≈ 0.7071 + something. Wait, 0.7841 radians is approximately 45 degrees + 0.7841 - 0.7854 ≈ 45 degrees - 0.0013 radians, so very close to π/4. So sin(0.7841) ≈ 0.7071.

Similarly, sin(π/(2002)) ≈ π/2002 ≈ 0.001570. 

Then, [sin(0.7841)/sin(0.001570)] ≈ 0.7071 / 0.001570 ≈ 450. 

Then, cos(501*(π/1001)/2) = cos(501π/2002). 501/2002 ≈ 0.25025. 0.25025*π ≈ 0.786 radians. So cos(0.786) ≈ 0.7060, similar to before.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7. Then (1/1001)*317.7 ≈ 0.3175, again close to 1/π ≈ 0.3183. So that also checks out.

Therefore, both even and odd cases give results approaching 1/π. So I can be confident that the limit is indeed 1/π. 

Just to recap, the key idea was recognizing that the given sum is a Riemann sum approximating the integral of cos(πx) from 0 to 1/2, which evaluates to 1/π. Additionally, verifying with the summation formula for cosines and checking specific numerical cases supported this conclusion. Therefore, the final answer is 1/π.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{\pi}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\; \frac{1}{n}\;\sum_{k=1}^{\Big\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\Big\rfloor} \cos\Big(\frac{k\pi}{n}\Big), \] we recognize that as \( n \) approaches infinity, the upper limit \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \) can be approximated by \( \frac{n}{2} \). This allows us to consider the sum as a Riemann sum approximation of an integral.

The sum \( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) can be approximated by the integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \). This is because the terms \( \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) with \( x_k = \frac{k}{n} \) approximate the function \( \cos(\pi x) \) over the interval \( [0, \frac{1}{2}] \) with spacing \( \frac{1}{n} \).

The integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \) is computed as follows:
\[
\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} \cos(\pi x) \, dx = \left[ \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi} \right]_0^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - \sin(0)}{\pi} = \frac{1 - 0}{\pi} = \frac{1}{\\pi}.
\]

Thus, the limit is evaluated to be \( \frac{1}{\pi} \).

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{\pi}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First off, since n is going to infinity, the floor(n/2) is going to be roughly n/2. So maybe I can approximate the upper limit as n/2 instead of floor(n/2) for large n? I think that should be okay because as n becomes very large, the difference between floor(n/2) and n/2 becomes negligible relative to n. So that simplifies the problem a bit.

So, now the expression is approximately (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to n/2 of cos(kπ/n). Wait, but n is going to infinity, so maybe I can turn this sum into a Riemann sum? Because Riemann sums involve sums that approximate integrals when the number of terms goes to infinity, and here we have a sum with terms that could be seen as function evaluations at points spaced by 1/n apart. Let me check.

Let&#x27;s consider the sum (1/n) * sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). If I let x_k = k/n, then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(x_k π) * (1/n). So x_k ranges from 1/n to (n/2)/n = 1/2 as k goes from 1 to n/2. As n approaches infinity, the spacing between consecutive x_k&#x27;s is 1/n, which tends to zero. Therefore, this sum should approximate the integral of cos(πx) from x=0 to x=1/2.

Wait, but the sum starts at k=1, so x starts at 1/n, which approaches 0 as n becomes large. So the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx. Then the limit should be equal to that integral. Let me verify this intuition.

The Riemann sum for a function f(x) over [a, b] is given by sum_{k=1}^n f(a + kΔx) Δx, where Δx = (b - a)/n. In our case, if we consider the interval from 0 to 1/2, then Δx would be (1/2 - 0)/n = 1/(2n), but our sum is (1/n) sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). Wait, maybe I need to adjust variables here.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s make a substitution. Let’s set x = k/n, so when k=1, x=1/n, and when k= n/2, x=1/2. The spacing between consecutive x’s is 1/n. So the sum is sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(πx) * (1/n). This is like a Riemann sum with sample points at the right endpoints of each subinterval. But the interval of integration would be from x=0 to x=1/2. However, the first term is at x=1/n, so as n approaches infinity, the difference between the sum and the integral from 0 to 1/2 would go to zero. Therefore, the limit should indeed be the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx.

Let me compute that integral. The integral of cos(πx) dx is (1/π) sin(πx) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 1/2, we get (1/π)[sin(π*(1/2)) - sin(0)] = (1/π)[sin(π/2) - 0] = (1/π)(1) = 1/π. Therefore, the limit should be 1/π. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check the setup. The original problem is the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n), multiplied by 1/n. As n approaches infinity, floor(n/2) is approximately n/2, but for even and odd n, floor(n/2) is either exactly n/2 or (n-1)/2. However, as n becomes large, the difference between n/2 and (n-1)/2 is negligible. So treating the upper limit as n/2 is acceptable. 

But to be precise, when n is even, floor(n/2) = n/2, and when n is odd, floor(n/2) = (n-1)/2. However, in both cases, as n tends to infinity, floor(n/2)/n tends to 1/2. So whether we use n/2 or (n-1)/2, the upper limit of the sum divided by n approaches 1/2. Therefore, the approximation as a Riemann sum over the interval [0, 1/2] should hold.

Therefore, the original limit is equal to the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx, which is 1/π. So the answer should be 1/π, which is approximately 0.318... But let me confirm once again.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the sum explicitly and then take the limit. However, that might be more complicated. Let me recall that the sum of cosines can sometimes be expressed in closed form. The formula for the sum of cos(kθ) from k=1 to m is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m+1)θ/2). Let me check that formula.

Yes, the formula for the sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2). So maybe I can use this formula here. Let&#x27;s set θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s first handle the case when n is even. Let n = 2m. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Applying the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)) = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2)

Wait, maybe let me plug into the formula correctly. The formula is:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) = [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So here θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s take n even first: n = 2m. Then θ = π/(2m), and the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Then applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2). Wait, no, that&#x27;s not correct. Let me be precise.

Wait, in the formula, θ is the common difference. So in our case, θ = π/n. For n even, m = n/2. So the sum is from k=1 to m of cos(kθ) where θ = π/n. Therefore, applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

Substituting m = n/2, θ = π/n:

Sum = [sin((n/2)(π/n)/2) / sin((π/n)/2)] * cos(((n/2 + 1)(π/n))/2)

Simplify each part:

First, mθ/2 = (n/2)(π/n)/2 = (π/2)/2 = π/4

Denominator sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2n))

Second part: ((m + 1)θ)/2 = ((n/2 + 1)π/n)/2 = (π/2 + π/n)/2 = π/4 + π/(2n)

Therefore, Sum = [sin(π/4)/sin(π/(2n))] * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

So, sin(π/4) is √2/2, so:

Sum = (√2/2) / sin(π/(2n)) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

Therefore, the original expression is (1/n) * Sum = (1/n) * [√2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))]

Now, as n approaches infinity, π/(2n) approaches 0, so sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n). Therefore, sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n) - (π/(2n))^3/6 + ... So, 1/sin(π/(2n)) ≈ 2n/π (1 + (π^2)/(24n^2) + ... )

Therefore, √2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) ≈ √2/(2) * (2n/π) (1 + ...) = √2 n / π (1 + ...)

Then, cos(π/4 + π/(2n)) = cos(π/4)cos(π/(2n)) - sin(π/4)sin(π/(2n)) ≈ (√2/2)(1 - (π/(2n))^2/2) - (√2/2)(π/(2n)) ≈ √2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n) - higher order terms.

Multiplying these together:

[√2 n / π] * [√2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n)] ≈ (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) - (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) * π/(2n) + ... = (2n / (2π)) - (2n / (2π)) * π/(2n) + ... = n/π - (1/2) + ...

Then, multiplying by (1/n):

(1/n) * [n/π - 1/2 + ...] = 1/π - 1/(2n) + ... 

So as n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/π. So that checks out for even n.

Now, let&#x27;s check when n is odd. Let n = 2m + 1. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m + 1)). Applying the same formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2), where θ = π/(2m + 1)

So, substituting:

Sum = [sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) / sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ] * cos( (m + 1) * π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Simplify:

First term in numerator: sin(mπ/(2(2m + 1))) = sin( (2m^2 + m)π / (2(2m + 1)) )? Wait, no, wait: m * π / (2(2m + 1)) is just mπ/(2(2m + 1)).

Similarly, denominator: sin(π/(2(2m + 1)))

Second term: cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Let me see if as m becomes large (since n = 2m + 1 approaches infinity), we can approximate this.

Let me set m large, so n = 2m + 1 ≈ 2m. Then θ = π/(2m + 1) ≈ π/(2m). Let&#x27;s see:

Numerator: sin(mθ/2) = sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ sin(m * π/(4m)) = sin(π/4) = √2/2.

Denominator: sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ π/(4m).

Similarly, the cosine term: cos( (m + 1)θ/2 ) = cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ cos( (m)π/(4m) ) = cos(π/4) = √2/2.

Therefore, Sum ≈ [√2/2 / (π/(4m))] * √2/2 = [ (√2/2) * (4m/π) ) ] * (√2/2 ) = ( (4m/π) * (√2/2) ) * (√2/2 ) = (4m/π) * (2/4) ) = (4m/π) * (1/2) ) = 2m/π.

Then, since n ≈ 2m, m ≈ n/2, so Sum ≈ 2*(n/2)/π = n/π. Therefore, (1/n)*Sum ≈ 1/π, same as before. Therefore, whether n is even or odd, as n becomes large, the sum divided by n tends to 1/π. Therefore, the limit is 1/π. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 1/π.

But just to be thorough, let me check with specific large n. Let&#x27;s take n = 1000 (even). Then floor(n/2) = 500. The sum is sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000). Then (1/1000)*sum ≈ integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx = 1/π ≈ 0.318. Let me compute the sum numerically. 

Alternatively, using the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000) = [sin(500*(π/1000)/2)/sin(π/(2000))] * cos((500 + 1)*(π/1000)/2)

Wait, using the formula again. Let me compute this. So m = 500, θ = π/1000.

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So mθ/2 = 500*(π/1000)/2 = π/4, same as before. sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071.

sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2000)) ≈ π/2000 - (π/2000)^3/6. Let&#x27;s compute sin(π/2000): π ≈ 3.1416, so π/2000 ≈ 0.0015708. sin(0.0015708) ≈ 0.0015708 - (0.0015708)^3/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - (3.875e-9)/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - 6.458e-10 ≈ 0.0015708. So sin(π/2000) ≈ 0.0015708.

Then, [sin(π/4)/sin(π/2000)] ≈ (0.7071)/(0.0015708) ≈ 450. 

Then, cos((m + 1)θ/2) = cos(501*(π/1000)/2) = cos(501π/2000). 501π/2000 ≈ (500π + π)/2000 = π/4 + π/2000 ≈ 0.7854 + 0.0015708 ≈ 0.7870 radians. cos(0.7870) ≈ 0.7071 (since π/4 is 0.7854, cos(π/4) ≈ 0.7071). So cos(501π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - sin(π/4)*(π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - 0.7071*0.0015708 ≈ 0.7071 - 0.001111 ≈ 0.7060.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7.

Then, (1/1000)*Sum ≈ 0.3177. And 1/π ≈ 0.3183, so that&#x27;s very close. So that checks out.

Similarly, for n = 1001 (odd), floor(n/2) = 500. Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1001). Let&#x27;s use the formula again.

θ = π/1001, m = 500.

Sum = [sin(500*(π/1001)/2)/sin(π/(2002))] * cos(501*(π/1001)/2)

Compute:

500*(π/1001)/2 ≈ (500/1001)*(π/2) ≈ 0.4995*(1.5708) ≈ 0.7841 radians.

sin(0.7841) ≈ sin(π/4 + a little) ≈ 0.7071 + something. Wait, 0.7841 radians is approximately 45 degrees + 0.7841 - 0.7854 ≈ 45 degrees - 0.0013 radians, so very close to π/4. So sin(0.7841) ≈ 0.7071.

Similarly, sin(π/(2002)) ≈ π/2002 ≈ 0.001570. 

Then, [sin(0.7841)/sin(0.001570)] ≈ 0.7071 / 0.001570 ≈ 450. 

Then, cos(501*(π/1001)/2) = cos(501π/2002). 501/2002 ≈ 0.25025. 0.25025*π ≈ 0.786 radians. So cos(0.786) ≈ 0.7060, similar to before.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7. Then (1/1001)*317.7 ≈ 0.3175, again close to 1/π ≈ 0.3183. So that also checks out.

Therefore, both even and odd cases give results approaching 1/π. So I can be confident that the limit is indeed 1/π. 

Just to recap, the key idea was recognizing that the given sum is a Riemann sum approximating the integral of cos(πx) from 0 to 1/2, which evaluates to 1/π. Additionally, verifying with the summation formula for cosines and checking specific numerical cases supported this conclusion. Therefore, the final answer is 1/π.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{\pi}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\; \frac{1}{n}\;\sum_{k=1}^{\Big\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\Big\rfloor} \cos\Big(\frac{k\pi}{n}\Big), \] we recognize that as \( n \) approaches infinity, the upper limit \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \) can be approximated by \( \frac{n}{2} \). This allows us to consider the sum as a Riemann sum approximation of an integral.

The sum \( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) can be approximated by the integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \). This is because the terms \( \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) with \( x_k = \frac{k}{n} \) approximate the function \( \cos(\pi x) \) over the interval \( [0, \frac{1}{2}] \) with spacing \( \frac{1}{n} \).

The integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \) is computed as follows:
\[
\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} \cos(\pi x) \, dx = \left[ \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi} \right]_0^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - \sin(0)}{\pi} = \frac{1 - 0}{\pi} = \frac{1}{\\pi}.
\]

Thus, the limit is evaluated to be \( \frac{1}{\pi} \).

\[

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First off, since n is going to infinity, the floor(n/2) is going to be roughly n/2. So maybe I can approximate the upper limit as n/2 instead of floor(n/2) for large n? I think that should be okay because as n becomes very large, the difference between floor(n/2) and n/2 becomes negligible relative to n. So that simplifies the problem a bit.

So, now the expression is approximately (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to n/2 of cos(kπ/n). Wait, but n is going to infinity, so maybe I can turn this sum into a Riemann sum? Because Riemann sums involve sums that approximate integrals when the number of terms goes to infinity, and here we have a sum with terms that could be seen as function evaluations at points spaced by 1/n apart. Let me check.

Let&#x27;s consider the sum (1/n) * sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). If I let x_k = k/n, then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(x_k π) * (1/n). So x_k ranges from 1/n to (n/2)/n = 1/2 as k goes from 1 to n/2. As n approaches infinity, the spacing between consecutive x_k&#x27;s is 1/n, which tends to zero. Therefore, this sum should approximate the integral of cos(πx) from x=0 to x=1/2.

Wait, but the sum starts at k=1, so x starts at 1/n, which approaches 0 as n becomes large. So the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx. Then the limit should be equal to that integral. Let me verify this intuition.

The Riemann sum for a function f(x) over [a, b] is given by sum_{k=1}^n f(a + kΔx) Δx, where Δx = (b - a)/n. In our case, if we consider the interval from 0 to 1/2, then Δx would be (1/2 - 0)/n = 1/(2n), but our sum is (1/n) sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). Wait, maybe I need to adjust variables here.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s make a substitution. Let’s set x = k/n, so when k=1, x=1/n, and when k= n/2, x=1/2. The spacing between consecutive x’s is 1/n. So the sum is sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(πx) * (1/n). This is like a Riemann sum with sample points at the right endpoints of each subinterval. But the interval of integration would be from x=0 to x=1/2. However, the first term is at x=1/n, so as n approaches infinity, the difference between the sum and the integral from 0 to 1/2 would go to zero. Therefore, the limit should indeed be the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx.

Let me compute that integral. The integral of cos(πx) dx is (1/π) sin(πx) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 1/2, we get (1/π)[sin(π*(1/2)) - sin(0)] = (1/π)[sin(π/2) - 0] = (1/π)(1) = 1/π. Therefore, the limit should be 1/π. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check the setup. The original problem is the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n), multiplied by 1/n. As n approaches infinity, floor(n/2) is approximately n/2, but for even and odd n, floor(n/2) is either exactly n/2 or (n-1)/2. However, as n becomes large, the difference between n/2 and (n-1)/2 is negligible. So treating the upper limit as n/2 is acceptable. 

But to be precise, when n is even, floor(n/2) = n/2, and when n is odd, floor(n/2) = (n-1)/2. However, in both cases, as n tends to infinity, floor(n/2)/n tends to 1/2. So whether we use n/2 or (n-1)/2, the upper limit of the sum divided by n approaches 1/2. Therefore, the approximation as a Riemann sum over the interval [0, 1/2] should hold.

Therefore, the original limit is equal to the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx, which is 1/π. So the answer should be 1/π, which is approximately 0.318... But let me confirm once again.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the sum explicitly and then take the limit. However, that might be more complicated. Let me recall that the sum of cosines can sometimes be expressed in closed form. The formula for the sum of cos(kθ) from k=1 to m is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m+1)θ/2). Let me check that formula.

Yes, the formula for the sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2). So maybe I can use this formula here. Let&#x27;s set θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s first handle the case when n is even. Let n = 2m. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Applying the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)) = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2)

Wait, maybe let me plug into the formula correctly. The formula is:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) = [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So here θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s take n even first: n = 2m. Then θ = π/(2m), and the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Then applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2). Wait, no, that&#x27;s not correct. Let me be precise.

Wait, in the formula, θ is the common difference. So in our case, θ = π/n. For n even, m = n/2. So the sum is from k=1 to m of cos(kθ) where θ = π/n. Therefore, applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

Substituting m = n/2, θ = π/n:

Sum = [sin((n/2)(π/n)/2) / sin((π/n)/2)] * cos(((n/2 + 1)(π/n))/2)

Simplify each part:

First, mθ/2 = (n/2)(π/n)/2 = (π/2)/2 = π/4

Denominator sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2n))

Second part: ((m + 1)θ)/2 = ((n/2 + 1)π/n)/2 = (π/2 + π/n)/2 = π/4 + π/(2n)

Therefore, Sum = [sin(π/4)/sin(π/(2n))] * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

So, sin(π/4) is √2/2, so:

Sum = (√2/2) / sin(π/(2n)) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

Therefore, the original expression is (1/n) * Sum = (1/n) * [√2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))]

Now, as n approaches infinity, π/(2n) approaches 0, so sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n). Therefore, sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n) - (π/(2n))^3/6 + ... So, 1/sin(π/(2n)) ≈ 2n/π (1 + (π^2)/(24n^2) + ... )

Therefore, √2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) ≈ √2/(2) * (2n/π) (1 + ...) = √2 n / π (1 + ...)

Then, cos(π/4 + π/(2n)) = cos(π/4)cos(π/(2n)) - sin(π/4)sin(π/(2n)) ≈ (√2/2)(1 - (π/(2n))^2/2) - (√2/2)(π/(2n)) ≈ √2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n) - higher order terms.

Multiplying these together:

[√2 n / π] * [√2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n)] ≈ (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) - (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) * π/(2n) + ... = (2n / (2π)) - (2n / (2π)) * π/(2n) + ... = n/π - (1/2) + ...

Then, multiplying by (1/n):

(1/n) * [n/π - 1/2 + ...] = 1/π - 1/(2n) + ... 

So as n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/π. So that checks out for even n.

Now, let&#x27;s check when n is odd. Let n = 2m + 1. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m + 1)). Applying the same formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2), where θ = π/(2m + 1)

So, substituting:

Sum = [sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) / sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ] * cos( (m + 1) * π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Simplify:

First term in numerator: sin(mπ/(2(2m + 1))) = sin( (2m^2 + m)π / (2(2m + 1)) )? Wait, no, wait: m * π / (2(2m + 1)) is just mπ/(2(2m + 1)).

Similarly, denominator: sin(π/(2(2m + 1)))

Second term: cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Let me see if as m becomes large (since n = 2m + 1 approaches infinity), we can approximate this.

Let me set m large, so n = 2m + 1 ≈ 2m. Then θ = π/(2m + 1) ≈ π/(2m). Let&#x27;s see:

Numerator: sin(mθ/2) = sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ sin(m * π/(4m)) = sin(π/4) = √2/2.

Denominator: sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ π/(4m).

Similarly, the cosine term: cos( (m + 1)θ/2 ) = cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ cos( (m)π/(4m) ) = cos(π/4) = √2/2.

Therefore, Sum ≈ [√2/2 / (π/(4m))] * √2/2 = [ (√2/2) * (4m/π) ) ] * (√2/2 ) = ( (4m/π) * (√2/2) ) * (√2/2 ) = (4m/π) * (2/4) ) = (4m/π) * (1/2) ) = 2m/π.

Then, since n ≈ 2m, m ≈ n/2, so Sum ≈ 2*(n/2)/π = n/π. Therefore, (1/n)*Sum ≈ 1/π, same as before. Therefore, whether n is even or odd, as n becomes large, the sum divided by n tends to 1/π. Therefore, the limit is 1/π. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 1/π.

But just to be thorough, let me check with specific large n. Let&#x27;s take n = 1000 (even). Then floor(n/2) = 500. The sum is sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000). Then (1/1000)*sum ≈ integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx = 1/π ≈ 0.318. Let me compute the sum numerically. 

Alternatively, using the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000) = [sin(500*(π/1000)/2)/sin(π/(2000))] * cos((500 + 1)*(π/1000)/2)

Wait, using the formula again. Let me compute this. So m = 500, θ = π/1000.

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So mθ/2 = 500*(π/1000)/2 = π/4, same as before. sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071.

sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2000)) ≈ π/2000 - (π/2000)^3/6. Let&#x27;s compute sin(π/2000): π ≈ 3.1416, so π/2000 ≈ 0.0015708. sin(0.0015708) ≈ 0.0015708 - (0.0015708)^3/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - (3.875e-9)/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - 6.458e-10 ≈ 0.0015708. So sin(π/2000) ≈ 0.0015708.

Then, [sin(π/4)/sin(π/2000)] ≈ (0.7071)/(0.0015708) ≈ 450. 

Then, cos((m + 1)θ/2) = cos(501*(π/1000)/2) = cos(501π/2000). 501π/2000 ≈ (500π + π)/2000 = π/4 + π/2000 ≈ 0.7854 + 0.0015708 ≈ 0.7870 radians. cos(0.7870) ≈ 0.7071 (since π/4 is 0.7854, cos(π/4) ≈ 0.7071). So cos(501π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - sin(π/4)*(π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - 0.7071*0.0015708 ≈ 0.7071 - 0.001111 ≈ 0.7060.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7.

Then, (1/1000)*Sum ≈ 0.3177. And 1/π ≈ 0.3183, so that&#x27;s very close. So that checks out.

Similarly, for n = 1001 (odd), floor(n/2) = 500. Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1001). Let&#x27;s use the formula again.

θ = π/1001, m = 500.

Sum = [sin(500*(π/1001)/2)/sin(π/(2002))] * cos(501*(π/1001)/2)

Compute:

500*(π/1001)/2 ≈ (500/1001)*(π/2) ≈ 0.4995*(1.5708) ≈ 0.7841 radians.

sin(0.7841) ≈ sin(π/4 + a little) ≈ 0.7071 + something. Wait, 0.7841 radians is approximately 45 degrees + 0.7841 - 0.7854 ≈ 45 degrees - 0.0013 radians, so very close to π/4. So sin(0.7841) ≈ 0.7071.

Similarly, sin(π/(2002)) ≈ π/2002 ≈ 0.001570. 

Then, [sin(0.7841)/sin(0.001570)] ≈ 0.7071 / 0.001570 ≈ 450. 

Then, cos(501*(π/1001)/2) = cos(501π/2002). 501/2002 ≈ 0.25025. 0.25025*π ≈ 0.786 radians. So cos(0.786) ≈ 0.7060, similar to before.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7. Then (1/1001)*317.7 ≈ 0.3175, again close to 1/π ≈ 0.3183. So that also checks out.

Therefore, both even and odd cases give results approaching 1/π. So I can be confident that the limit is indeed 1/π. 

Just to recap, the key idea was recognizing that the given sum is a Riemann sum approximating the integral of cos(πx) from 0 to 1/2, which evaluates to 1/π. Additionally, verifying with the summation formula for cosines and checking specific numerical cases supported this conclusion. Therefore, the final answer is 1/π.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{\pi}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\; \frac{1}{n}\;\sum_{k=1}^{\Big\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\Big\rfloor} \cos\Big(\frac{k\pi}{n}\Big), \] we recognize that as \( n \) approaches infinity, the upper limit \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \) can be approximated by \( \frac{n}{2} \). This allows us to consider the sum as a Riemann sum approximation of an integral.

The sum \( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) can be approximated by the integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \). This is because the terms \( \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) with \( x_k = \frac{k}{n} \) approximate the function \( \cos(\pi x) \) over the interval \( [0, \frac{1}{2}] \) with spacing \( \frac{1}{n} \).

The integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \) is computed as follows:
\[
\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} \cos(\pi x) \, dx = \left[ \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi} \right]_0^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - \sin(0)}{\pi} = \frac{1 - 0}{\pi} = \frac{1}{\\pi}.
\]

Thus, the limit is evaluated to be \( \frac{1}{\pi} \).

First off, since n is going to infinity, the floor(n/2) is going to be roughly n/2. So maybe I can approximate the upper limit as n/2 instead of floor(n/2) for large n? I think that should be okay because as n becomes very large, the difference between floor(n/2) and n/2 becomes negligible relative to n. So that simplifies the problem a bit.

So, now the expression is approximately (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to n/2 of cos(kπ/n). Wait, but n is going to infinity, so maybe I can turn this sum into a Riemann sum? Because Riemann sums involve sums that approximate integrals when the number of terms goes to infinity, and here we have a sum with terms that could be seen as function evaluations at points spaced by 1/n apart. Let me check.

Let&#x27;s consider the sum (1/n) * sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). If I let x_k = k/n, then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(x_k π) * (1/n). So x_k ranges from 1/n to (n/2)/n = 1/2 as k goes from 1 to n/2. As n approaches infinity, the spacing between consecutive x_k&#x27;s is 1/n, which tends to zero. Therefore, this sum should approximate the integral of cos(πx) from x=0 to x=1/2.

Wait, but the sum starts at k=1, so x starts at 1/n, which approaches 0 as n becomes large. So the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx. Then the limit should be equal to that integral. Let me verify this intuition.

The Riemann sum for a function f(x) over [a, b] is given by sum_{k=1}^n f(a + kΔx) Δx, where Δx = (b - a)/n. In our case, if we consider the interval from 0 to 1/2, then Δx would be (1/2 - 0)/n = 1/(2n), but our sum is (1/n) sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). Wait, maybe I need to adjust variables here.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s make a substitution. Let’s set x = k/n, so when k=1, x=1/n, and when k= n/2, x=1/2. The spacing between consecutive x’s is 1/n. So the sum is sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(πx) * (1/n). This is like a Riemann sum with sample points at the right endpoints of each subinterval. But the interval of integration would be from x=0 to x=1/2. However, the first term is at x=1/n, so as n approaches infinity, the difference between the sum and the integral from 0 to 1/2 would go to zero. Therefore, the limit should indeed be the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx.

Let me compute that integral. The integral of cos(πx) dx is (1/π) sin(πx) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 1/2, we get (1/π)[sin(π*(1/2)) - sin(0)] = (1/π)[sin(π/2) - 0] = (1/π)(1) = 1/π. Therefore, the limit should be 1/π. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check the setup. The original problem is the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n), multiplied by 1/n. As n approaches infinity, floor(n/2) is approximately n/2, but for even and odd n, floor(n/2) is either exactly n/2 or (n-1)/2. However, as n becomes large, the difference between n/2 and (n-1)/2 is negligible. So treating the upper limit as n/2 is acceptable. 

But to be precise, when n is even, floor(n/2) = n/2, and when n is odd, floor(n/2) = (n-1)/2. However, in both cases, as n tends to infinity, floor(n/2)/n tends to 1/2. So whether we use n/2 or (n-1)/2, the upper limit of the sum divided by n approaches 1/2. Therefore, the approximation as a Riemann sum over the interval [0, 1/2] should hold.

Therefore, the original limit is equal to the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx, which is 1/π. So the answer should be 1/π, which is approximately 0.318... But let me confirm once again.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the sum explicitly and then take the limit. However, that might be more complicated. Let me recall that the sum of cosines can sometimes be expressed in closed form. The formula for the sum of cos(kθ) from k=1 to m is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m+1)θ/2). Let me check that formula.

Yes, the formula for the sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2). So maybe I can use this formula here. Let&#x27;s set θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s first handle the case when n is even. Let n = 2m. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Applying the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)) = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2)

Wait, maybe let me plug into the formula correctly. The formula is:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) = [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So here θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s take n even first: n = 2m. Then θ = π/(2m), and the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Then applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2). Wait, no, that&#x27;s not correct. Let me be precise.

Wait, in the formula, θ is the common difference. So in our case, θ = π/n. For n even, m = n/2. So the sum is from k=1 to m of cos(kθ) where θ = π/n. Therefore, applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

Substituting m = n/2, θ = π/n:

Sum = [sin((n/2)(π/n)/2) / sin((π/n)/2)] * cos(((n/2 + 1)(π/n))/2)

Simplify each part:

First, mθ/2 = (n/2)(π/n)/2 = (π/2)/2 = π/4

Denominator sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2n))

Second part: ((m + 1)θ)/2 = ((n/2 + 1)π/n)/2 = (π/2 + π/n)/2 = π/4 + π/(2n)

Therefore, Sum = [sin(π/4)/sin(π/(2n))] * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

So, sin(π/4) is √2/2, so:

Sum = (√2/2) / sin(π/(2n)) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

Therefore, the original expression is (1/n) * Sum = (1/n) * [√2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))]

Now, as n approaches infinity, π/(2n) approaches 0, so sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n). Therefore, sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n) - (π/(2n))^3/6 + ... So, 1/sin(π/(2n)) ≈ 2n/π (1 + (π^2)/(24n^2) + ... )

Therefore, √2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) ≈ √2/(2) * (2n/π) (1 + ...) = √2 n / π (1 + ...)

Then, cos(π/4 + π/(2n)) = cos(π/4)cos(π/(2n)) - sin(π/4)sin(π/(2n)) ≈ (√2/2)(1 - (π/(2n))^2/2) - (√2/2)(π/(2n)) ≈ √2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n) - higher order terms.

Multiplying these together:

[√2 n / π] * [√2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n)] ≈ (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) - (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) * π/(2n) + ... = (2n / (2π)) - (2n / (2π)) * π/(2n) + ... = n/π - (1/2) + ...

Then, multiplying by (1/n):

(1/n) * [n/π - 1/2 + ...] = 1/π - 1/(2n) + ... 

So as n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/π. So that checks out for even n.

Now, let&#x27;s check when n is odd. Let n = 2m + 1. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m + 1)). Applying the same formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2), where θ = π/(2m + 1)

So, substituting:

Sum = [sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) / sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ] * cos( (m + 1) * π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Simplify:

First term in numerator: sin(mπ/(2(2m + 1))) = sin( (2m^2 + m)π / (2(2m + 1)) )? Wait, no, wait: m * π / (2(2m + 1)) is just mπ/(2(2m + 1)).

Similarly, denominator: sin(π/(2(2m + 1)))

Second term: cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Let me see if as m becomes large (since n = 2m + 1 approaches infinity), we can approximate this.

Let me set m large, so n = 2m + 1 ≈ 2m. Then θ = π/(2m + 1) ≈ π/(2m). Let&#x27;s see:

Numerator: sin(mθ/2) = sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ sin(m * π/(4m)) = sin(π/4) = √2/2.

Denominator: sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ π/(4m).

Similarly, the cosine term: cos( (m + 1)θ/2 ) = cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ cos( (m)π/(4m) ) = cos(π/4) = √2/2.

Therefore, Sum ≈ [√2/2 / (π/(4m))] * √2/2 = [ (√2/2) * (4m/π) ) ] * (√2/2 ) = ( (4m/π) * (√2/2) ) * (√2/2 ) = (4m/π) * (2/4) ) = (4m/π) * (1/2) ) = 2m/π.

Then, since n ≈ 2m, m ≈ n/2, so Sum ≈ 2*(n/2)/π = n/π. Therefore, (1/n)*Sum ≈ 1/π, same as before. Therefore, whether n is even or odd, as n becomes large, the sum divided by n tends to 1/π. Therefore, the limit is 1/π. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 1/π.

But just to be thorough, let me check with specific large n. Let&#x27;s take n = 1000 (even). Then floor(n/2) = 500. The sum is sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000). Then (1/1000)*sum ≈ integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx = 1/π ≈ 0.318. Let me compute the sum numerically. 

Alternatively, using the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000) = [sin(500*(π/1000)/2)/sin(π/(2000))] * cos((500 + 1)*(π/1000)/2)

Wait, using the formula again. Let me compute this. So m = 500, θ = π/1000.

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So mθ/2 = 500*(π/1000)/2 = π/4, same as before. sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071.

sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2000)) ≈ π/2000 - (π/2000)^3/6. Let&#x27;s compute sin(π/2000): π ≈ 3.1416, so π/2000 ≈ 0.0015708. sin(0.0015708) ≈ 0.0015708 - (0.0015708)^3/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - (3.875e-9)/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - 6.458e-10 ≈ 0.0015708. So sin(π/2000) ≈ 0.0015708.

Then, [sin(π/4)/sin(π/2000)] ≈ (0.7071)/(0.0015708) ≈ 450. 

Then, cos((m + 1)θ/2) = cos(501*(π/1000)/2) = cos(501π/2000). 501π/2000 ≈ (500π + π)/2000 = π/4 + π/2000 ≈ 0.7854 + 0.0015708 ≈ 0.7870 radians. cos(0.7870) ≈ 0.7071 (since π/4 is 0.7854, cos(π/4) ≈ 0.7071). So cos(501π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - sin(π/4)*(π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - 0.7071*0.0015708 ≈ 0.7071 - 0.001111 ≈ 0.7060.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7.

Then, (1/1000)*Sum ≈ 0.3177. And 1/π ≈ 0.3183, so that&#x27;s very close. So that checks out.

Similarly, for n = 1001 (odd), floor(n/2) = 500. Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1001). Let&#x27;s use the formula again.

θ = π/1001, m = 500.

Sum = [sin(500*(π/1001)/2)/sin(π/(2002))] * cos(501*(π/1001)/2)

Compute:

500*(π/1001)/2 ≈ (500/1001)*(π/2) ≈ 0.4995*(1.5708) ≈ 0.7841 radians.

sin(0.7841) ≈ sin(π/4 + a little) ≈ 0.7071 + something. Wait, 0.7841 radians is approximately 45 degrees + 0.7841 - 0.7854 ≈ 45 degrees - 0.0013 radians, so very close to π/4. So sin(0.7841) ≈ 0.7071.

Similarly, sin(π/(2002)) ≈ π/2002 ≈ 0.001570. 

Then, [sin(0.7841)/sin(0.001570)] ≈ 0.7071 / 0.001570 ≈ 450. 

Then, cos(501*(π/1001)/2) = cos(501π/2002). 501/2002 ≈ 0.25025. 0.25025*π ≈ 0.786 radians. So cos(0.786) ≈ 0.7060, similar to before.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7. Then (1/1001)*317.7 ≈ 0.3175, again close to 1/π ≈ 0.3183. So that also checks out.

Therefore, both even and odd cases give results approaching 1/π. So I can be confident that the limit is indeed 1/π. 

Just to recap, the key idea was recognizing that the given sum is a Riemann sum approximating the integral of cos(πx) from 0 to 1/2, which evaluates to 1/π. Additionally, verifying with the summation formula for cosines and checking specific numerical cases supported this conclusion. Therefore, the final answer is 1/π.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{\pi}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\; \frac{1}{n}\;\sum_{k=1}^{\Big\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\Big\rfloor} \cos\Big(\frac{k\pi}{n}\Big), \] we recognize that as \( n \) approaches infinity, the upper limit \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \) can be approximated by \( \frac{n}{2} \). This allows us to consider the sum as a Riemann sum approximation of an integral.

The sum \( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) can be approximated by the integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \). This is because the terms \( \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) with \( x_k = \frac{k}{n} \) approximate the function \( \cos(\pi x) \) over the interval \( [0, \frac{1}{2}] \) with spacing \( \frac{1}{n} \).

The integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \) is computed as follows:
\[
\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} \cos(\pi x) \, dx = \left[ \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi} \right]_0^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - \sin(0)}{\pi} = \frac{1 - 0}{\pi} = \frac{1}{\\pi}.
\]

Thus, the limit is evaluated to be \( \frac{1}{\pi} \).

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{\pi}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First off, since n is going to infinity, the floor(n/2) is going to be roughly n/2. So maybe I can approximate the upper limit as n/2 instead of floor(n/2) for large n? I think that should be okay because as n becomes very large, the difference between floor(n/2) and n/2 becomes negligible relative to n. So that simplifies the problem a bit.

So, now the expression is approximately (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to n/2 of cos(kπ/n). Wait, but n is going to infinity, so maybe I can turn this sum into a Riemann sum? Because Riemann sums involve sums that approximate integrals when the number of terms goes to infinity, and here we have a sum with terms that could be seen as function evaluations at points spaced by 1/n apart. Let me check.

Let&#x27;s consider the sum (1/n) * sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). If I let x_k = k/n, then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(x_k π) * (1/n). So x_k ranges from 1/n to (n/2)/n = 1/2 as k goes from 1 to n/2. As n approaches infinity, the spacing between consecutive x_k&#x27;s is 1/n, which tends to zero. Therefore, this sum should approximate the integral of cos(πx) from x=0 to x=1/2.

Wait, but the sum starts at k=1, so x starts at 1/n, which approaches 0 as n becomes large. So the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx. Then the limit should be equal to that integral. Let me verify this intuition.

The Riemann sum for a function f(x) over [a, b] is given by sum_{k=1}^n f(a + kΔx) Δx, where Δx = (b - a)/n. In our case, if we consider the interval from 0 to 1/2, then Δx would be (1/2 - 0)/n = 1/(2n), but our sum is (1/n) sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). Wait, maybe I need to adjust variables here.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s make a substitution. Let’s set x = k/n, so when k=1, x=1/n, and when k= n/2, x=1/2. The spacing between consecutive x’s is 1/n. So the sum is sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(πx) * (1/n). This is like a Riemann sum with sample points at the right endpoints of each subinterval. But the interval of integration would be from x=0 to x=1/2. However, the first term is at x=1/n, so as n approaches infinity, the difference between the sum and the integral from 0 to 1/2 would go to zero. Therefore, the limit should indeed be the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx.

Let me compute that integral. The integral of cos(πx) dx is (1/π) sin(πx) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 1/2, we get (1/π)[sin(π*(1/2)) - sin(0)] = (1/π)[sin(π/2) - 0] = (1/π)(1) = 1/π. Therefore, the limit should be 1/π. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check the setup. The original problem is the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n), multiplied by 1/n. As n approaches infinity, floor(n/2) is approximately n/2, but for even and odd n, floor(n/2) is either exactly n/2 or (n-1)/2. However, as n becomes large, the difference between n/2 and (n-1)/2 is negligible. So treating the upper limit as n/2 is acceptable. 

But to be precise, when n is even, floor(n/2) = n/2, and when n is odd, floor(n/2) = (n-1)/2. However, in both cases, as n tends to infinity, floor(n/2)/n tends to 1/2. So whether we use n/2 or (n-1)/2, the upper limit of the sum divided by n approaches 1/2. Therefore, the approximation as a Riemann sum over the interval [0, 1/2] should hold.

Therefore, the original limit is equal to the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx, which is 1/π. So the answer should be 1/π, which is approximately 0.318... But let me confirm once again.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the sum explicitly and then take the limit. However, that might be more complicated. Let me recall that the sum of cosines can sometimes be expressed in closed form. The formula for the sum of cos(kθ) from k=1 to m is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m+1)θ/2). Let me check that formula.

Yes, the formula for the sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2). So maybe I can use this formula here. Let&#x27;s set θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s first handle the case when n is even. Let n = 2m. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Applying the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)) = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2)

Wait, maybe let me plug into the formula correctly. The formula is:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) = [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So here θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s take n even first: n = 2m. Then θ = π/(2m), and the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Then applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2). Wait, no, that&#x27;s not correct. Let me be precise.

Wait, in the formula, θ is the common difference. So in our case, θ = π/n. For n even, m = n/2. So the sum is from k=1 to m of cos(kθ) where θ = π/n. Therefore, applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

Substituting m = n/2, θ = π/n:

Sum = [sin((n/2)(π/n)/2) / sin((π/n)/2)] * cos(((n/2 + 1)(π/n))/2)

Simplify each part:

First, mθ/2 = (n/2)(π/n)/2 = (π/2)/2 = π/4

Denominator sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2n))

Second part: ((m + 1)θ)/2 = ((n/2 + 1)π/n)/2 = (π/2 + π/n)/2 = π/4 + π/(2n)

Therefore, Sum = [sin(π/4)/sin(π/(2n))] * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

So, sin(π/4) is √2/2, so:

Sum = (√2/2) / sin(π/(2n)) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

Therefore, the original expression is (1/n) * Sum = (1/n) * [√2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))]

Now, as n approaches infinity, π/(2n) approaches 0, so sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n). Therefore, sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n) - (π/(2n))^3/6 + ... So, 1/sin(π/(2n)) ≈ 2n/π (1 + (π^2)/(24n^2) + ... )

Therefore, √2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) ≈ √2/(2) * (2n/π) (1 + ...) = √2 n / π (1 + ...)

Then, cos(π/4 + π/(2n)) = cos(π/4)cos(π/(2n)) - sin(π/4)sin(π/(2n)) ≈ (√2/2)(1 - (π/(2n))^2/2) - (√2/2)(π/(2n)) ≈ √2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n) - higher order terms.

Multiplying these together:

[√2 n / π] * [√2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n)] ≈ (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) - (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) * π/(2n) + ... = (2n / (2π)) - (2n / (2π)) * π/(2n) + ... = n/π - (1/2) + ...

Then, multiplying by (1/n):

(1/n) * [n/π - 1/2 + ...] = 1/π - 1/(2n) + ... 

So as n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/π. So that checks out for even n.

Now, let&#x27;s check when n is odd. Let n = 2m + 1. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m + 1)). Applying the same formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2), where θ = π/(2m + 1)

So, substituting:

Sum = [sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) / sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ] * cos( (m + 1) * π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Simplify:

First term in numerator: sin(mπ/(2(2m + 1))) = sin( (2m^2 + m)π / (2(2m + 1)) )? Wait, no, wait: m * π / (2(2m + 1)) is just mπ/(2(2m + 1)).

Similarly, denominator: sin(π/(2(2m + 1)))

Second term: cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Let me see if as m becomes large (since n = 2m + 1 approaches infinity), we can approximate this.

Let me set m large, so n = 2m + 1 ≈ 2m. Then θ = π/(2m + 1) ≈ π/(2m). Let&#x27;s see:

Numerator: sin(mθ/2) = sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ sin(m * π/(4m)) = sin(π/4) = √2/2.

Denominator: sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ π/(4m).

Similarly, the cosine term: cos( (m + 1)θ/2 ) = cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ cos( (m)π/(4m) ) = cos(π/4) = √2/2.

Therefore, Sum ≈ [√2/2 / (π/(4m))] * √2/2 = [ (√2/2) * (4m/π) ) ] * (√2/2 ) = ( (4m/π) * (√2/2) ) * (√2/2 ) = (4m/π) * (2/4) ) = (4m/π) * (1/2) ) = 2m/π.

Then, since n ≈ 2m, m ≈ n/2, so Sum ≈ 2*(n/2)/π = n/π. Therefore, (1/n)*Sum ≈ 1/π, same as before. Therefore, whether n is even or odd, as n becomes large, the sum divided by n tends to 1/π. Therefore, the limit is 1/π. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 1/π.

But just to be thorough, let me check with specific large n. Let&#x27;s take n = 1000 (even). Then floor(n/2) = 500. The sum is sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000). Then (1/1000)*sum ≈ integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx = 1/π ≈ 0.318. Let me compute the sum numerically. 

Alternatively, using the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000) = [sin(500*(π/1000)/2)/sin(π/(2000))] * cos((500 + 1)*(π/1000)/2)

Wait, using the formula again. Let me compute this. So m = 500, θ = π/1000.

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So mθ/2 = 500*(π/1000)/2 = π/4, same as before. sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071.

sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2000)) ≈ π/2000 - (π/2000)^3/6. Let&#x27;s compute sin(π/2000): π ≈ 3.1416, so π/2000 ≈ 0.0015708. sin(0.0015708) ≈ 0.0015708 - (0.0015708)^3/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - (3.875e-9)/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - 6.458e-10 ≈ 0.0015708. So sin(π/2000) ≈ 0.0015708.

Then, [sin(π/4)/sin(π/2000)] ≈ (0.7071)/(0.0015708) ≈ 450. 

Then, cos((m + 1)θ/2) = cos(501*(π/1000)/2) = cos(501π/2000). 501π/2000 ≈ (500π + π)/2000 = π/4 + π/2000 ≈ 0.7854 + 0.0015708 ≈ 0.7870 radians. cos(0.7870) ≈ 0.7071 (since π/4 is 0.7854, cos(π/4) ≈ 0.7071). So cos(501π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - sin(π/4)*(π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - 0.7071*0.0015708 ≈ 0.7071 - 0.001111 ≈ 0.7060.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7.

Then, (1/1000)*Sum ≈ 0.3177. And 1/π ≈ 0.3183, so that&#x27;s very close. So that checks out.

Similarly, for n = 1001 (odd), floor(n/2) = 500. Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1001). Let&#x27;s use the formula again.

θ = π/1001, m = 500.

Sum = [sin(500*(π/1001)/2)/sin(π/(2002))] * cos(501*(π/1001)/2)

Compute:

500*(π/1001)/2 ≈ (500/1001)*(π/2) ≈ 0.4995*(1.5708) ≈ 0.7841 radians.

sin(0.7841) ≈ sin(π/4 + a little) ≈ 0.7071 + something. Wait, 0.7841 radians is approximately 45 degrees + 0.7841 - 0.7854 ≈ 45 degrees - 0.0013 radians, so very close to π/4. So sin(0.7841) ≈ 0.7071.

Similarly, sin(π/(2002)) ≈ π/2002 ≈ 0.001570. 

Then, [sin(0.7841)/sin(0.001570)] ≈ 0.7071 / 0.001570 ≈ 450. 

Then, cos(501*(π/1001)/2) = cos(501π/2002). 501/2002 ≈ 0.25025. 0.25025*π ≈ 0.786 radians. So cos(0.786) ≈ 0.7060, similar to before.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7. Then (1/1001)*317.7 ≈ 0.3175, again close to 1/π ≈ 0.3183. So that also checks out.

Therefore, both even and odd cases give results approaching 1/π. So I can be confident that the limit is indeed 1/π. 

Just to recap, the key idea was recognizing that the given sum is a Riemann sum approximating the integral of cos(πx) from 0 to 1/2, which evaluates to 1/π. Additionally, verifying with the summation formula for cosines and checking specific numerical cases supported this conclusion. Therefore, the final answer is 1/π.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{\pi}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\; \frac{1}{n}\;\sum_{k=1}^{\Big\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\Big\rfloor} \cos\Big(\frac{k\pi}{n}\Big), \] we recognize that as \( n \) approaches infinity, the upper limit \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \) can be approximated by \( \frac{n}{2} \). This allows us to consider the sum as a Riemann sum approximation of an integral.

The sum \( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) can be approximated by the integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \). This is because the terms \( \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) with \( x_k = \frac{k}{n} \) approximate the function \( \cos(\pi x) \) over the interval \( [0, \frac{1}{2}] \) with spacing \( \frac{1}{n} \).

The integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \) is computed as follows:
\[
\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} \cos(\pi x) \, dx = \left[ \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi} \right]_0^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - \sin(0)}{\pi} = \frac{1 - 0}{\pi} = \frac{1}{\\pi}.
\]

Thus, the limit is evaluated to be \( \frac{1}{\pi} \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First off, since n is going to infinity, the floor(n/2) is going to be roughly n/2. So maybe I can approximate the upper limit as n/2 instead of floor(n/2) for large n? I think that should be okay because as n becomes very large, the difference between floor(n/2) and n/2 becomes negligible relative to n. So that simplifies the problem a bit.

So, now the expression is approximately (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to n/2 of cos(kπ/n). Wait, but n is going to infinity, so maybe I can turn this sum into a Riemann sum? Because Riemann sums involve sums that approximate integrals when the number of terms goes to infinity, and here we have a sum with terms that could be seen as function evaluations at points spaced by 1/n apart. Let me check.

Let&#x27;s consider the sum (1/n) * sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). If I let x_k = k/n, then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(x_k π) * (1/n). So x_k ranges from 1/n to (n/2)/n = 1/2 as k goes from 1 to n/2. As n approaches infinity, the spacing between consecutive x_k&#x27;s is 1/n, which tends to zero. Therefore, this sum should approximate the integral of cos(πx) from x=0 to x=1/2.

Wait, but the sum starts at k=1, so x starts at 1/n, which approaches 0 as n becomes large. So the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx. Then the limit should be equal to that integral. Let me verify this intuition.

The Riemann sum for a function f(x) over [a, b] is given by sum_{k=1}^n f(a + kΔx) Δx, where Δx = (b - a)/n. In our case, if we consider the interval from 0 to 1/2, then Δx would be (1/2 - 0)/n = 1/(2n), but our sum is (1/n) sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). Wait, maybe I need to adjust variables here.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s make a substitution. Let’s set x = k/n, so when k=1, x=1/n, and when k= n/2, x=1/2. The spacing between consecutive x’s is 1/n. So the sum is sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(πx) * (1/n). This is like a Riemann sum with sample points at the right endpoints of each subinterval. But the interval of integration would be from x=0 to x=1/2. However, the first term is at x=1/n, so as n approaches infinity, the difference between the sum and the integral from 0 to 1/2 would go to zero. Therefore, the limit should indeed be the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx.

Let me compute that integral. The integral of cos(πx) dx is (1/π) sin(πx) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 1/2, we get (1/π)[sin(π*(1/2)) - sin(0)] = (1/π)[sin(π/2) - 0] = (1/π)(1) = 1/π. Therefore, the limit should be 1/π. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check the setup. The original problem is the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n), multiplied by 1/n. As n approaches infinity, floor(n/2) is approximately n/2, but for even and odd n, floor(n/2) is either exactly n/2 or (n-1)/2. However, as n becomes large, the difference between n/2 and (n-1)/2 is negligible. So treating the upper limit as n/2 is acceptable. 

But to be precise, when n is even, floor(n/2) = n/2, and when n is odd, floor(n/2) = (n-1)/2. However, in both cases, as n tends to infinity, floor(n/2)/n tends to 1/2. So whether we use n/2 or (n-1)/2, the upper limit of the sum divided by n approaches 1/2. Therefore, the approximation as a Riemann sum over the interval [0, 1/2] should hold.

Therefore, the original limit is equal to the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx, which is 1/π. So the answer should be 1/π, which is approximately 0.318... But let me confirm once again.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the sum explicitly and then take the limit. However, that might be more complicated. Let me recall that the sum of cosines can sometimes be expressed in closed form. The formula for the sum of cos(kθ) from k=1 to m is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m+1)θ/2). Let me check that formula.

Yes, the formula for the sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2). So maybe I can use this formula here. Let&#x27;s set θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s first handle the case when n is even. Let n = 2m. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Applying the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)) = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2)

Wait, maybe let me plug into the formula correctly. The formula is:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) = [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So here θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s take n even first: n = 2m. Then θ = π/(2m), and the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Then applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2). Wait, no, that&#x27;s not correct. Let me be precise.

Wait, in the formula, θ is the common difference. So in our case, θ = π/n. For n even, m = n/2. So the sum is from k=1 to m of cos(kθ) where θ = π/n. Therefore, applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

Substituting m = n/2, θ = π/n:

Sum = [sin((n/2)(π/n)/2) / sin((π/n)/2)] * cos(((n/2 + 1)(π/n))/2)

Simplify each part:

First, mθ/2 = (n/2)(π/n)/2 = (π/2)/2 = π/4

Denominator sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2n))

Second part: ((m + 1)θ)/2 = ((n/2 + 1)π/n)/2 = (π/2 + π/n)/2 = π/4 + π/(2n)

Therefore, Sum = [sin(π/4)/sin(π/(2n))] * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

So, sin(π/4) is √2/2, so:

Sum = (√2/2) / sin(π/(2n)) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

Therefore, the original expression is (1/n) * Sum = (1/n) * [√2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))]

Now, as n approaches infinity, π/(2n) approaches 0, so sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n). Therefore, sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n) - (π/(2n))^3/6 + ... So, 1/sin(π/(2n)) ≈ 2n/π (1 + (π^2)/(24n^2) + ... )

Therefore, √2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) ≈ √2/(2) * (2n/π) (1 + ...) = √2 n / π (1 + ...)

Then, cos(π/4 + π/(2n)) = cos(π/4)cos(π/(2n)) - sin(π/4)sin(π/(2n)) ≈ (√2/2)(1 - (π/(2n))^2/2) - (√2/2)(π/(2n)) ≈ √2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n) - higher order terms.

Multiplying these together:

[√2 n / π] * [√2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n)] ≈ (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) - (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) * π/(2n) + ... = (2n / (2π)) - (2n / (2π)) * π/(2n) + ... = n/π - (1/2) + ...

Then, multiplying by (1/n):

(1/n) * [n/π - 1/2 + ...] = 1/π - 1/(2n) + ... 

So as n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/π. So that checks out for even n.

Now, let&#x27;s check when n is odd. Let n = 2m + 1. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m + 1)). Applying the same formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2), where θ = π/(2m + 1)

So, substituting:

Sum = [sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) / sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ] * cos( (m + 1) * π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Simplify:

First term in numerator: sin(mπ/(2(2m + 1))) = sin( (2m^2 + m)π / (2(2m + 1)) )? Wait, no, wait: m * π / (2(2m + 1)) is just mπ/(2(2m + 1)).

Similarly, denominator: sin(π/(2(2m + 1)))

Second term: cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Let me see if as m becomes large (since n = 2m + 1 approaches infinity), we can approximate this.

Let me set m large, so n = 2m + 1 ≈ 2m. Then θ = π/(2m + 1) ≈ π/(2m). Let&#x27;s see:

Numerator: sin(mθ/2) = sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ sin(m * π/(4m)) = sin(π/4) = √2/2.

Denominator: sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ π/(4m).

Similarly, the cosine term: cos( (m + 1)θ/2 ) = cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ cos( (m)π/(4m) ) = cos(π/4) = √2/2.

Therefore, Sum ≈ [√2/2 / (π/(4m))] * √2/2 = [ (√2/2) * (4m/π) ) ] * (√2/2 ) = ( (4m/π) * (√2/2) ) * (√2/2 ) = (4m/π) * (2/4) ) = (4m/π) * (1/2) ) = 2m/π.

Then, since n ≈ 2m, m ≈ n/2, so Sum ≈ 2*(n/2)/π = n/π. Therefore, (1/n)*Sum ≈ 1/π, same as before. Therefore, whether n is even or odd, as n becomes large, the sum divided by n tends to 1/π. Therefore, the limit is 1/π. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 1/π.

But just to be thorough, let me check with specific large n. Let&#x27;s take n = 1000 (even). Then floor(n/2) = 500. The sum is sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000). Then (1/1000)*sum ≈ integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx = 1/π ≈ 0.318. Let me compute the sum numerically. 

Alternatively, using the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000) = [sin(500*(π/1000)/2)/sin(π/(2000))] * cos((500 + 1)*(π/1000)/2)

Wait, using the formula again. Let me compute this. So m = 500, θ = π/1000.

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So mθ/2 = 500*(π/1000)/2 = π/4, same as before. sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071.

sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2000)) ≈ π/2000 - (π/2000)^3/6. Let&#x27;s compute sin(π/2000): π ≈ 3.1416, so π/2000 ≈ 0.0015708. sin(0.0015708) ≈ 0.0015708 - (0.0015708)^3/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - (3.875e-9)/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - 6.458e-10 ≈ 0.0015708. So sin(π/2000) ≈ 0.0015708.

Then, [sin(π/4)/sin(π/2000)] ≈ (0.7071)/(0.0015708) ≈ 450. 

Then, cos((m + 1)θ/2) = cos(501*(π/1000)/2) = cos(501π/2000). 501π/2000 ≈ (500π + π)/2000 = π/4 + π/2000 ≈ 0.7854 + 0.0015708 ≈ 0.7870 radians. cos(0.7870) ≈ 0.7071 (since π/4 is 0.7854, cos(π/4) ≈ 0.7071). So cos(501π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - sin(π/4)*(π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - 0.7071*0.0015708 ≈ 0.7071 - 0.001111 ≈ 0.7060.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7.

Then, (1/1000)*Sum ≈ 0.3177. And 1/π ≈ 0.3183, so that&#x27;s very close. So that checks out.

Similarly, for n = 1001 (odd), floor(n/2) = 500. Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1001). Let&#x27;s use the formula again.

θ = π/1001, m = 500.

Sum = [sin(500*(π/1001)/2)/sin(π/(2002))] * cos(501*(π/1001)/2)

Compute:

500*(π/1001)/2 ≈ (500/1001)*(π/2) ≈ 0.4995*(1.5708) ≈ 0.7841 radians.

sin(0.7841) ≈ sin(π/4 + a little) ≈ 0.7071 + something. Wait, 0.7841 radians is approximately 45 degrees + 0.7841 - 0.7854 ≈ 45 degrees - 0.0013 radians, so very close to π/4. So sin(0.7841) ≈ 0.7071.

Similarly, sin(π/(2002)) ≈ π/2002 ≈ 0.001570. 

Then, [sin(0.7841)/sin(0.001570)] ≈ 0.7071 / 0.001570 ≈ 450. 

Then, cos(501*(π/1001)/2) = cos(501π/2002). 501/2002 ≈ 0.25025. 0.25025*π ≈ 0.786 radians. So cos(0.786) ≈ 0.7060, similar to before.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7. Then (1/1001)*317.7 ≈ 0.3175, again close to 1/π ≈ 0.3183. So that also checks out.

Therefore, both even and odd cases give results approaching 1/π. So I can be confident that the limit is indeed 1/π. 

Just to recap, the key idea was recognizing that the given sum is a Riemann sum approximating the integral of cos(πx) from 0 to 1/2, which evaluates to 1/π. Additionally, verifying with the summation formula for cosines and checking specific numerical cases supported this conclusion. Therefore, the final answer is 1/π.

\boxed{\dfrac{1}{\pi}}

To evaluate the limit \[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\; \frac{1}{n}\;\sum_{k=1}^{\Big\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\Big\rfloor} \cos\Big(\frac{k\pi}{n}\Big), \] we recognize that as \( n \) approaches infinity, the upper limit \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \) can be approximated by \( \frac{n}{2} \). This allows us to consider the sum as a Riemann sum approximation of an integral.

The sum \( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) can be approximated by the integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \). This is because the terms \( \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) with \( x_k = \frac{k}{n} \) approximate the function \( \cos(\pi x) \) over the interval \( [0, \frac{1}{2}] \) with spacing \( \frac{1}{n} \).

The integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \) is computed as follows:
\[
\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} \cos(\pi x) \, dx = \left[ \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi} \right]_0^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - \sin(0)}{\pi} = \frac{1 - 0}{\pi} = \frac{1}{\\pi}.
\]

Thus, the limit is evaluated to be \( \frac{1}{\pi} \).

\[

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First off, since n is going to infinity, the floor(n/2) is going to be roughly n/2. So maybe I can approximate the upper limit as n/2 instead of floor(n/2) for large n? I think that should be okay because as n becomes very large, the difference between floor(n/2) and n/2 becomes negligible relative to n. So that simplifies the problem a bit.

So, now the expression is approximately (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to n/2 of cos(kπ/n). Wait, but n is going to infinity, so maybe I can turn this sum into a Riemann sum? Because Riemann sums involve sums that approximate integrals when the number of terms goes to infinity, and here we have a sum with terms that could be seen as function evaluations at points spaced by 1/n apart. Let me check.

Let&#x27;s consider the sum (1/n) * sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). If I let x_k = k/n, then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(x_k π) * (1/n). So x_k ranges from 1/n to (n/2)/n = 1/2 as k goes from 1 to n/2. As n approaches infinity, the spacing between consecutive x_k&#x27;s is 1/n, which tends to zero. Therefore, this sum should approximate the integral of cos(πx) from x=0 to x=1/2.

Wait, but the sum starts at k=1, so x starts at 1/n, which approaches 0 as n becomes large. So the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx. Then the limit should be equal to that integral. Let me verify this intuition.

The Riemann sum for a function f(x) over [a, b] is given by sum_{k=1}^n f(a + kΔx) Δx, where Δx = (b - a)/n. In our case, if we consider the interval from 0 to 1/2, then Δx would be (1/2 - 0)/n = 1/(2n), but our sum is (1/n) sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). Wait, maybe I need to adjust variables here.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s make a substitution. Let’s set x = k/n, so when k=1, x=1/n, and when k= n/2, x=1/2. The spacing between consecutive x’s is 1/n. So the sum is sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(πx) * (1/n). This is like a Riemann sum with sample points at the right endpoints of each subinterval. But the interval of integration would be from x=0 to x=1/2. However, the first term is at x=1/n, so as n approaches infinity, the difference between the sum and the integral from 0 to 1/2 would go to zero. Therefore, the limit should indeed be the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx.

Let me compute that integral. The integral of cos(πx) dx is (1/π) sin(πx) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 1/2, we get (1/π)[sin(π*(1/2)) - sin(0)] = (1/π)[sin(π/2) - 0] = (1/π)(1) = 1/π. Therefore, the limit should be 1/π. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check the setup. The original problem is the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n), multiplied by 1/n. As n approaches infinity, floor(n/2) is approximately n/2, but for even and odd n, floor(n/2) is either exactly n/2 or (n-1)/2. However, as n becomes large, the difference between n/2 and (n-1)/2 is negligible. So treating the upper limit as n/2 is acceptable. 

But to be precise, when n is even, floor(n/2) = n/2, and when n is odd, floor(n/2) = (n-1)/2. However, in both cases, as n tends to infinity, floor(n/2)/n tends to 1/2. So whether we use n/2 or (n-1)/2, the upper limit of the sum divided by n approaches 1/2. Therefore, the approximation as a Riemann sum over the interval [0, 1/2] should hold.

Therefore, the original limit is equal to the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx, which is 1/π. So the answer should be 1/π, which is approximately 0.318... But let me confirm once again.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the sum explicitly and then take the limit. However, that might be more complicated. Let me recall that the sum of cosines can sometimes be expressed in closed form. The formula for the sum of cos(kθ) from k=1 to m is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m+1)θ/2). Let me check that formula.

Yes, the formula for the sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2). So maybe I can use this formula here. Let&#x27;s set θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s first handle the case when n is even. Let n = 2m. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Applying the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)) = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2)

Wait, maybe let me plug into the formula correctly. The formula is:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) = [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So here θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s take n even first: n = 2m. Then θ = π/(2m), and the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Then applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2). Wait, no, that&#x27;s not correct. Let me be precise.

Wait, in the formula, θ is the common difference. So in our case, θ = π/n. For n even, m = n/2. So the sum is from k=1 to m of cos(kθ) where θ = π/n. Therefore, applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

Substituting m = n/2, θ = π/n:

Sum = [sin((n/2)(π/n)/2) / sin((π/n)/2)] * cos(((n/2 + 1)(π/n))/2)

Simplify each part:

First, mθ/2 = (n/2)(π/n)/2 = (π/2)/2 = π/4

Denominator sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2n))

Second part: ((m + 1)θ)/2 = ((n/2 + 1)π/n)/2 = (π/2 + π/n)/2 = π/4 + π/(2n)

Therefore, Sum = [sin(π/4)/sin(π/(2n))] * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

So, sin(π/4) is √2/2, so:

Sum = (√2/2) / sin(π/(2n)) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

Therefore, the original expression is (1/n) * Sum = (1/n) * [√2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))]

Now, as n approaches infinity, π/(2n) approaches 0, so sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n). Therefore, sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n) - (π/(2n))^3/6 + ... So, 1/sin(π/(2n)) ≈ 2n/π (1 + (π^2)/(24n^2) + ... )

Therefore, √2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) ≈ √2/(2) * (2n/π) (1 + ...) = √2 n / π (1 + ...)

Then, cos(π/4 + π/(2n)) = cos(π/4)cos(π/(2n)) - sin(π/4)sin(π/(2n)) ≈ (√2/2)(1 - (π/(2n))^2/2) - (√2/2)(π/(2n)) ≈ √2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n) - higher order terms.

Multiplying these together:

[√2 n / π] * [√2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n)] ≈ (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) - (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) * π/(2n) + ... = (2n / (2π)) - (2n / (2π)) * π/(2n) + ... = n/π - (1/2) + ...

Then, multiplying by (1/n):

(1/n) * [n/π - 1/2 + ...] = 1/π - 1/(2n) + ... 

So as n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/π. So that checks out for even n.

Now, let&#x27;s check when n is odd. Let n = 2m + 1. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m + 1)). Applying the same formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2), where θ = π/(2m + 1)

So, substituting:

Sum = [sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) / sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ] * cos( (m + 1) * π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Simplify:

First term in numerator: sin(mπ/(2(2m + 1))) = sin( (2m^2 + m)π / (2(2m + 1)) )? Wait, no, wait: m * π / (2(2m + 1)) is just mπ/(2(2m + 1)).

Similarly, denominator: sin(π/(2(2m + 1)))

Second term: cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Let me see if as m becomes large (since n = 2m + 1 approaches infinity), we can approximate this.

Let me set m large, so n = 2m + 1 ≈ 2m. Then θ = π/(2m + 1) ≈ π/(2m). Let&#x27;s see:

Numerator: sin(mθ/2) = sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ sin(m * π/(4m)) = sin(π/4) = √2/2.

Denominator: sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ π/(4m).

Similarly, the cosine term: cos( (m + 1)θ/2 ) = cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ cos( (m)π/(4m) ) = cos(π/4) = √2/2.

Therefore, Sum ≈ [√2/2 / (π/(4m))] * √2/2 = [ (√2/2) * (4m/π) ) ] * (√2/2 ) = ( (4m/π) * (√2/2) ) * (√2/2 ) = (4m/π) * (2/4) ) = (4m/π) * (1/2) ) = 2m/π.

Then, since n ≈ 2m, m ≈ n/2, so Sum ≈ 2*(n/2)/π = n/π. Therefore, (1/n)*Sum ≈ 1/π, same as before. Therefore, whether n is even or odd, as n becomes large, the sum divided by n tends to 1/π. Therefore, the limit is 1/π. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 1/π.

But just to be thorough, let me check with specific large n. Let&#x27;s take n = 1000 (even). Then floor(n/2) = 500. The sum is sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000). Then (1/1000)*sum ≈ integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx = 1/π ≈ 0.318. Let me compute the sum numerically. 

Alternatively, using the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000) = [sin(500*(π/1000)/2)/sin(π/(2000))] * cos((500 + 1)*(π/1000)/2)

Wait, using the formula again. Let me compute this. So m = 500, θ = π/1000.

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So mθ/2 = 500*(π/1000)/2 = π/4, same as before. sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071.

sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2000)) ≈ π/2000 - (π/2000)^3/6. Let&#x27;s compute sin(π/2000): π ≈ 3.1416, so π/2000 ≈ 0.0015708. sin(0.0015708) ≈ 0.0015708 - (0.0015708)^3/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - (3.875e-9)/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - 6.458e-10 ≈ 0.0015708. So sin(π/2000) ≈ 0.0015708.

Then, [sin(π/4)/sin(π/2000)] ≈ (0.7071)/(0.0015708) ≈ 450. 

Then, cos((m + 1)θ/2) = cos(501*(π/1000)/2) = cos(501π/2000). 501π/2000 ≈ (500π + π)/2000 = π/4 + π/2000 ≈ 0.7854 + 0.0015708 ≈ 0.7870 radians. cos(0.7870) ≈ 0.7071 (since π/4 is 0.7854, cos(π/4) ≈ 0.7071). So cos(501π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - sin(π/4)*(π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - 0.7071*0.0015708 ≈ 0.7071 - 0.001111 ≈ 0.7060.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7.

Then, (1/1000)*Sum ≈ 0.3177. And 1/π ≈ 0.3183, so that&#x27;s very close. So that checks out.

Similarly, for n = 1001 (odd), floor(n/2) = 500. Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1001). Let&#x27;s use the formula again.

θ = π/1001, m = 500.

Sum = [sin(500*(π/1001)/2)/sin(π/(2002))] * cos(501*(π/1001)/2)

Compute:

500*(π/1001)/2 ≈ (500/1001)*(π/2) ≈ 0.4995*(1.5708) ≈ 0.7841 radians.

sin(0.7841) ≈ sin(π/4 + a little) ≈ 0.7071 + something. Wait, 0.7841 radians is approximately 45 degrees + 0.7841 - 0.7854 ≈ 45 degrees - 0.0013 radians, so very close to π/4. So sin(0.7841) ≈ 0.7071.

Similarly, sin(π/(2002)) ≈ π/2002 ≈ 0.001570. 

Then, [sin(0.7841)/sin(0.001570)] ≈ 0.7071 / 0.001570 ≈ 450. 

Then, cos(501*(π/1001)/2) = cos(501π/2002). 501/2002 ≈ 0.25025. 0.25025*π ≈ 0.786 radians. So cos(0.786) ≈ 0.7060, similar to before.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7. Then (1/1001)*317.7 ≈ 0.3175, again close to 1/π ≈ 0.3183. So that also checks out.

Therefore, both even and odd cases give results approaching 1/π. So I can be confident that the limit is indeed 1/π. 

Just to recap, the key idea was recognizing that the given sum is a Riemann sum approximating the integral of cos(πx) from 0 to 1/2, which evaluates to 1/π. Additionally, verifying with the summation formula for cosines and checking specific numerical cases supported this conclusion. Therefore, the final answer is 1/π.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{\pi}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\; \frac{1}{n}\;\sum_{k=1}^{\Big\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\Big\rfloor} \cos\Big(\frac{k\pi}{n}\Big), \] we recognize that as \( n \) approaches infinity, the upper limit \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \) can be approximated by \( \frac{n}{2} \). This allows us to consider the sum as a Riemann sum approximation of an integral.

The sum \( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) can be approximated by the integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \). This is because the terms \( \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) with \( x_k = \frac{k}{n} \) approximate the function \( \cos(\pi x) \) over the interval \( [0, \frac{1}{2}] \) with spacing \( \frac{1}{n} \).

The integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \) is computed as follows:
\[
\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} \cos(\pi x) \, dx = \left[ \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi} \right]_0^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - \sin(0)}{\pi} = \frac{1 - 0}{\pi} = \frac{1}{\\pi}.
\]

Thus, the limit is evaluated to be \( \frac{1}{\pi} \).

\[

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First off, since n is going to infinity, the floor(n/2) is going to be roughly n/2. So maybe I can approximate the upper limit as n/2 instead of floor(n/2) for large n? I think that should be okay because as n becomes very large, the difference between floor(n/2) and n/2 becomes negligible relative to n. So that simplifies the problem a bit.

So, now the expression is approximately (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to n/2 of cos(kπ/n). Wait, but n is going to infinity, so maybe I can turn this sum into a Riemann sum? Because Riemann sums involve sums that approximate integrals when the number of terms goes to infinity, and here we have a sum with terms that could be seen as function evaluations at points spaced by 1/n apart. Let me check.

Let&#x27;s consider the sum (1/n) * sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). If I let x_k = k/n, then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(x_k π) * (1/n). So x_k ranges from 1/n to (n/2)/n = 1/2 as k goes from 1 to n/2. As n approaches infinity, the spacing between consecutive x_k&#x27;s is 1/n, which tends to zero. Therefore, this sum should approximate the integral of cos(πx) from x=0 to x=1/2.

Wait, but the sum starts at k=1, so x starts at 1/n, which approaches 0 as n becomes large. So the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx. Then the limit should be equal to that integral. Let me verify this intuition.

The Riemann sum for a function f(x) over [a, b] is given by sum_{k=1}^n f(a + kΔx) Δx, where Δx = (b - a)/n. In our case, if we consider the interval from 0 to 1/2, then Δx would be (1/2 - 0)/n = 1/(2n), but our sum is (1/n) sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). Wait, maybe I need to adjust variables here.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s make a substitution. Let’s set x = k/n, so when k=1, x=1/n, and when k= n/2, x=1/2. The spacing between consecutive x’s is 1/n. So the sum is sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(πx) * (1/n). This is like a Riemann sum with sample points at the right endpoints of each subinterval. But the interval of integration would be from x=0 to x=1/2. However, the first term is at x=1/n, so as n approaches infinity, the difference between the sum and the integral from 0 to 1/2 would go to zero. Therefore, the limit should indeed be the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx.

Let me compute that integral. The integral of cos(πx) dx is (1/π) sin(πx) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 1/2, we get (1/π)[sin(π*(1/2)) - sin(0)] = (1/π)[sin(π/2) - 0] = (1/π)(1) = 1/π. Therefore, the limit should be 1/π. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check the setup. The original problem is the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n), multiplied by 1/n. As n approaches infinity, floor(n/2) is approximately n/2, but for even and odd n, floor(n/2) is either exactly n/2 or (n-1)/2. However, as n becomes large, the difference between n/2 and (n-1)/2 is negligible. So treating the upper limit as n/2 is acceptable. 

But to be precise, when n is even, floor(n/2) = n/2, and when n is odd, floor(n/2) = (n-1)/2. However, in both cases, as n tends to infinity, floor(n/2)/n tends to 1/2. So whether we use n/2 or (n-1)/2, the upper limit of the sum divided by n approaches 1/2. Therefore, the approximation as a Riemann sum over the interval [0, 1/2] should hold.

Therefore, the original limit is equal to the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx, which is 1/π. So the answer should be 1/π, which is approximately 0.318... But let me confirm once again.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the sum explicitly and then take the limit. However, that might be more complicated. Let me recall that the sum of cosines can sometimes be expressed in closed form. The formula for the sum of cos(kθ) from k=1 to m is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m+1)θ/2). Let me check that formula.

Yes, the formula for the sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2). So maybe I can use this formula here. Let&#x27;s set θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s first handle the case when n is even. Let n = 2m. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Applying the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)) = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2)

Wait, maybe let me plug into the formula correctly. The formula is:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) = [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So here θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s take n even first: n = 2m. Then θ = π/(2m), and the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Then applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2). Wait, no, that&#x27;s not correct. Let me be precise.

Wait, in the formula, θ is the common difference. So in our case, θ = π/n. For n even, m = n/2. So the sum is from k=1 to m of cos(kθ) where θ = π/n. Therefore, applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

Substituting m = n/2, θ = π/n:

Sum = [sin((n/2)(π/n)/2) / sin((π/n)/2)] * cos(((n/2 + 1)(π/n))/2)

Simplify each part:

First, mθ/2 = (n/2)(π/n)/2 = (π/2)/2 = π/4

Denominator sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2n))

Second part: ((m + 1)θ)/2 = ((n/2 + 1)π/n)/2 = (π/2 + π/n)/2 = π/4 + π/(2n)

Therefore, Sum = [sin(π/4)/sin(π/(2n))] * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

So, sin(π/4) is √2/2, so:

Sum = (√2/2) / sin(π/(2n)) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

Therefore, the original expression is (1/n) * Sum = (1/n) * [√2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))]

Now, as n approaches infinity, π/(2n) approaches 0, so sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n). Therefore, sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n) - (π/(2n))^3/6 + ... So, 1/sin(π/(2n)) ≈ 2n/π (1 + (π^2)/(24n^2) + ... )

Therefore, √2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) ≈ √2/(2) * (2n/π) (1 + ...) = √2 n / π (1 + ...)

Then, cos(π/4 + π/(2n)) = cos(π/4)cos(π/(2n)) - sin(π/4)sin(π/(2n)) ≈ (√2/2)(1 - (π/(2n))^2/2) - (√2/2)(π/(2n)) ≈ √2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n) - higher order terms.

Multiplying these together:

[√2 n / π] * [√2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n)] ≈ (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) - (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) * π/(2n) + ... = (2n / (2π)) - (2n / (2π)) * π/(2n) + ... = n/π - (1/2) + ...

Then, multiplying by (1/n):

(1/n) * [n/π - 1/2 + ...] = 1/π - 1/(2n) + ... 

So as n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/π. So that checks out for even n.

Now, let&#x27;s check when n is odd. Let n = 2m + 1. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m + 1)). Applying the same formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2), where θ = π/(2m + 1)

So, substituting:

Sum = [sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) / sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ] * cos( (m + 1) * π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Simplify:

First term in numerator: sin(mπ/(2(2m + 1))) = sin( (2m^2 + m)π / (2(2m + 1)) )? Wait, no, wait: m * π / (2(2m + 1)) is just mπ/(2(2m + 1)).

Similarly, denominator: sin(π/(2(2m + 1)))

Second term: cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Let me see if as m becomes large (since n = 2m + 1 approaches infinity), we can approximate this.

Let me set m large, so n = 2m + 1 ≈ 2m. Then θ = π/(2m + 1) ≈ π/(2m). Let&#x27;s see:

Numerator: sin(mθ/2) = sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ sin(m * π/(4m)) = sin(π/4) = √2/2.

Denominator: sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ π/(4m).

Similarly, the cosine term: cos( (m + 1)θ/2 ) = cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ cos( (m)π/(4m) ) = cos(π/4) = √2/2.

Therefore, Sum ≈ [√2/2 / (π/(4m))] * √2/2 = [ (√2/2) * (4m/π) ) ] * (√2/2 ) = ( (4m/π) * (√2/2) ) * (√2/2 ) = (4m/π) * (2/4) ) = (4m/π) * (1/2) ) = 2m/π.

Then, since n ≈ 2m, m ≈ n/2, so Sum ≈ 2*(n/2)/π = n/π. Therefore, (1/n)*Sum ≈ 1/π, same as before. Therefore, whether n is even or odd, as n becomes large, the sum divided by n tends to 1/π. Therefore, the limit is 1/π. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 1/π.

But just to be thorough, let me check with specific large n. Let&#x27;s take n = 1000 (even). Then floor(n/2) = 500. The sum is sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000). Then (1/1000)*sum ≈ integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx = 1/π ≈ 0.318. Let me compute the sum numerically. 

Alternatively, using the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000) = [sin(500*(π/1000)/2)/sin(π/(2000))] * cos((500 + 1)*(π/1000)/2)

Wait, using the formula again. Let me compute this. So m = 500, θ = π/1000.

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So mθ/2 = 500*(π/1000)/2 = π/4, same as before. sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071.

sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2000)) ≈ π/2000 - (π/2000)^3/6. Let&#x27;s compute sin(π/2000): π ≈ 3.1416, so π/2000 ≈ 0.0015708. sin(0.0015708) ≈ 0.0015708 - (0.0015708)^3/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - (3.875e-9)/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - 6.458e-10 ≈ 0.0015708. So sin(π/2000) ≈ 0.0015708.

Then, [sin(π/4)/sin(π/2000)] ≈ (0.7071)/(0.0015708) ≈ 450. 

Then, cos((m + 1)θ/2) = cos(501*(π/1000)/2) = cos(501π/2000). 501π/2000 ≈ (500π + π)/2000 = π/4 + π/2000 ≈ 0.7854 + 0.0015708 ≈ 0.7870 radians. cos(0.7870) ≈ 0.7071 (since π/4 is 0.7854, cos(π/4) ≈ 0.7071). So cos(501π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - sin(π/4)*(π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - 0.7071*0.0015708 ≈ 0.7071 - 0.001111 ≈ 0.7060.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7.

Then, (1/1000)*Sum ≈ 0.3177. And 1/π ≈ 0.3183, so that&#x27;s very close. So that checks out.

Similarly, for n = 1001 (odd), floor(n/2) = 500. Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1001). Let&#x27;s use the formula again.

θ = π/1001, m = 500.

Sum = [sin(500*(π/1001)/2)/sin(π/(2002))] * cos(501*(π/1001)/2)

Compute:

500*(π/1001)/2 ≈ (500/1001)*(π/2) ≈ 0.4995*(1.5708) ≈ 0.7841 radians.

sin(0.7841) ≈ sin(π/4 + a little) ≈ 0.7071 + something. Wait, 0.7841 radians is approximately 45 degrees + 0.7841 - 0.7854 ≈ 45 degrees - 0.0013 radians, so very close to π/4. So sin(0.7841) ≈ 0.7071.

Similarly, sin(π/(2002)) ≈ π/2002 ≈ 0.001570. 

Then, [sin(0.7841)/sin(0.001570)] ≈ 0.7071 / 0.001570 ≈ 450. 

Then, cos(501*(π/1001)/2) = cos(501π/2002). 501/2002 ≈ 0.25025. 0.25025*π ≈ 0.786 radians. So cos(0.786) ≈ 0.7060, similar to before.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7. Then (1/1001)*317.7 ≈ 0.3175, again close to 1/π ≈ 0.3183. So that also checks out.

Therefore, both even and odd cases give results approaching 1/π. So I can be confident that the limit is indeed 1/π. 

Just to recap, the key idea was recognizing that the given sum is a Riemann sum approximating the integral of cos(πx) from 0 to 1/2, which evaluates to 1/π. Additionally, verifying with the summation formula for cosines and checking specific numerical cases supported this conclusion. Therefore, the final answer is 1/π.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{\pi}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\; \frac{1}{n}\;\sum_{k=1}^{\Big\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\Big\rfloor} \cos\Big(\frac{k\pi}{n}\Big), \] we recognize that as \( n \) approaches infinity, the upper limit \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \) can be approximated by \( \frac{n}{2} \). This allows us to consider the sum as a Riemann sum approximation of an integral.

The sum \( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) can be approximated by the integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \). This is because the terms \( \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) with \( x_k = \frac{k}{n} \) approximate the function \( \cos(\pi x) \) over the interval \( [0, \frac{1}{2}] \) with spacing \( \frac{1}{n} \).

The integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \) is computed as follows:
\[
\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} \cos(\pi x) \, dx = \left[ \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi} \right]_0^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - \sin(0)}{\pi} = \frac{1 - 0}{\pi} = \frac{1}{\\pi}.
\]

Thus, the limit is evaluated to be \( \frac{1}{\pi} \).

\[

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First off, since n is going to infinity, the floor(n/2) is going to be roughly n/2. So maybe I can approximate the upper limit as n/2 instead of floor(n/2) for large n? I think that should be okay because as n becomes very large, the difference between floor(n/2) and n/2 becomes negligible relative to n. So that simplifies the problem a bit.

So, now the expression is approximately (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to n/2 of cos(kπ/n). Wait, but n is going to infinity, so maybe I can turn this sum into a Riemann sum? Because Riemann sums involve sums that approximate integrals when the number of terms goes to infinity, and here we have a sum with terms that could be seen as function evaluations at points spaced by 1/n apart. Let me check.

Let&#x27;s consider the sum (1/n) * sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). If I let x_k = k/n, then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(x_k π) * (1/n). So x_k ranges from 1/n to (n/2)/n = 1/2 as k goes from 1 to n/2. As n approaches infinity, the spacing between consecutive x_k&#x27;s is 1/n, which tends to zero. Therefore, this sum should approximate the integral of cos(πx) from x=0 to x=1/2.

Wait, but the sum starts at k=1, so x starts at 1/n, which approaches 0 as n becomes large. So the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx. Then the limit should be equal to that integral. Let me verify this intuition.

The Riemann sum for a function f(x) over [a, b] is given by sum_{k=1}^n f(a + kΔx) Δx, where Δx = (b - a)/n. In our case, if we consider the interval from 0 to 1/2, then Δx would be (1/2 - 0)/n = 1/(2n), but our sum is (1/n) sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). Wait, maybe I need to adjust variables here.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s make a substitution. Let’s set x = k/n, so when k=1, x=1/n, and when k= n/2, x=1/2. The spacing between consecutive x’s is 1/n. So the sum is sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(πx) * (1/n). This is like a Riemann sum with sample points at the right endpoints of each subinterval. But the interval of integration would be from x=0 to x=1/2. However, the first term is at x=1/n, so as n approaches infinity, the difference between the sum and the integral from 0 to 1/2 would go to zero. Therefore, the limit should indeed be the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx.

Let me compute that integral. The integral of cos(πx) dx is (1/π) sin(πx) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 1/2, we get (1/π)[sin(π*(1/2)) - sin(0)] = (1/π)[sin(π/2) - 0] = (1/π)(1) = 1/π. Therefore, the limit should be 1/π. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check the setup. The original problem is the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n), multiplied by 1/n. As n approaches infinity, floor(n/2) is approximately n/2, but for even and odd n, floor(n/2) is either exactly n/2 or (n-1)/2. However, as n becomes large, the difference between n/2 and (n-1)/2 is negligible. So treating the upper limit as n/2 is acceptable. 

But to be precise, when n is even, floor(n/2) = n/2, and when n is odd, floor(n/2) = (n-1)/2. However, in both cases, as n tends to infinity, floor(n/2)/n tends to 1/2. So whether we use n/2 or (n-1)/2, the upper limit of the sum divided by n approaches 1/2. Therefore, the approximation as a Riemann sum over the interval [0, 1/2] should hold.

Therefore, the original limit is equal to the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx, which is 1/π. So the answer should be 1/π, which is approximately 0.318... But let me confirm once again.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the sum explicitly and then take the limit. However, that might be more complicated. Let me recall that the sum of cosines can sometimes be expressed in closed form. The formula for the sum of cos(kθ) from k=1 to m is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m+1)θ/2). Let me check that formula.

Yes, the formula for the sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2). So maybe I can use this formula here. Let&#x27;s set θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s first handle the case when n is even. Let n = 2m. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Applying the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)) = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2)

Wait, maybe let me plug into the formula correctly. The formula is:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) = [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So here θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s take n even first: n = 2m. Then θ = π/(2m), and the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Then applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2). Wait, no, that&#x27;s not correct. Let me be precise.

Wait, in the formula, θ is the common difference. So in our case, θ = π/n. For n even, m = n/2. So the sum is from k=1 to m of cos(kθ) where θ = π/n. Therefore, applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

Substituting m = n/2, θ = π/n:

Sum = [sin((n/2)(π/n)/2) / sin((π/n)/2)] * cos(((n/2 + 1)(π/n))/2)

Simplify each part:

First, mθ/2 = (n/2)(π/n)/2 = (π/2)/2 = π/4

Denominator sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2n))

Second part: ((m + 1)θ)/2 = ((n/2 + 1)π/n)/2 = (π/2 + π/n)/2 = π/4 + π/(2n)

Therefore, Sum = [sin(π/4)/sin(π/(2n))] * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

So, sin(π/4) is √2/2, so:

Sum = (√2/2) / sin(π/(2n)) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

Therefore, the original expression is (1/n) * Sum = (1/n) * [√2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))]

Now, as n approaches infinity, π/(2n) approaches 0, so sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n). Therefore, sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n) - (π/(2n))^3/6 + ... So, 1/sin(π/(2n)) ≈ 2n/π (1 + (π^2)/(24n^2) + ... )

Therefore, √2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) ≈ √2/(2) * (2n/π) (1 + ...) = √2 n / π (1 + ...)

Then, cos(π/4 + π/(2n)) = cos(π/4)cos(π/(2n)) - sin(π/4)sin(π/(2n)) ≈ (√2/2)(1 - (π/(2n))^2/2) - (√2/2)(π/(2n)) ≈ √2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n) - higher order terms.

Multiplying these together:

[√2 n / π] * [√2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n)] ≈ (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) - (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) * π/(2n) + ... = (2n / (2π)) - (2n / (2π)) * π/(2n) + ... = n/π - (1/2) + ...

Then, multiplying by (1/n):

(1/n) * [n/π - 1/2 + ...] = 1/π - 1/(2n) + ... 

So as n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/π. So that checks out for even n.

Now, let&#x27;s check when n is odd. Let n = 2m + 1. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m + 1)). Applying the same formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2), where θ = π/(2m + 1)

So, substituting:

Sum = [sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) / sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ] * cos( (m + 1) * π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Simplify:

First term in numerator: sin(mπ/(2(2m + 1))) = sin( (2m^2 + m)π / (2(2m + 1)) )? Wait, no, wait: m * π / (2(2m + 1)) is just mπ/(2(2m + 1)).

Similarly, denominator: sin(π/(2(2m + 1)))

Second term: cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Let me see if as m becomes large (since n = 2m + 1 approaches infinity), we can approximate this.

Let me set m large, so n = 2m + 1 ≈ 2m. Then θ = π/(2m + 1) ≈ π/(2m). Let&#x27;s see:

Numerator: sin(mθ/2) = sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ sin(m * π/(4m)) = sin(π/4) = √2/2.

Denominator: sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ π/(4m).

Similarly, the cosine term: cos( (m + 1)θ/2 ) = cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ cos( (m)π/(4m) ) = cos(π/4) = √2/2.

Therefore, Sum ≈ [√2/2 / (π/(4m))] * √2/2 = [ (√2/2) * (4m/π) ) ] * (√2/2 ) = ( (4m/π) * (√2/2) ) * (√2/2 ) = (4m/π) * (2/4) ) = (4m/π) * (1/2) ) = 2m/π.

Then, since n ≈ 2m, m ≈ n/2, so Sum ≈ 2*(n/2)/π = n/π. Therefore, (1/n)*Sum ≈ 1/π, same as before. Therefore, whether n is even or odd, as n becomes large, the sum divided by n tends to 1/π. Therefore, the limit is 1/π. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 1/π.

But just to be thorough, let me check with specific large n. Let&#x27;s take n = 1000 (even). Then floor(n/2) = 500. The sum is sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000). Then (1/1000)*sum ≈ integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx = 1/π ≈ 0.318. Let me compute the sum numerically. 

Alternatively, using the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000) = [sin(500*(π/1000)/2)/sin(π/(2000))] * cos((500 + 1)*(π/1000)/2)

Wait, using the formula again. Let me compute this. So m = 500, θ = π/1000.

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So mθ/2 = 500*(π/1000)/2 = π/4, same as before. sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071.

sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2000)) ≈ π/2000 - (π/2000)^3/6. Let&#x27;s compute sin(π/2000): π ≈ 3.1416, so π/2000 ≈ 0.0015708. sin(0.0015708) ≈ 0.0015708 - (0.0015708)^3/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - (3.875e-9)/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - 6.458e-10 ≈ 0.0015708. So sin(π/2000) ≈ 0.0015708.

Then, [sin(π/4)/sin(π/2000)] ≈ (0.7071)/(0.0015708) ≈ 450. 

Then, cos((m + 1)θ/2) = cos(501*(π/1000)/2) = cos(501π/2000). 501π/2000 ≈ (500π + π)/2000 = π/4 + π/2000 ≈ 0.7854 + 0.0015708 ≈ 0.7870 radians. cos(0.7870) ≈ 0.7071 (since π/4 is 0.7854, cos(π/4) ≈ 0.7071). So cos(501π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - sin(π/4)*(π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - 0.7071*0.0015708 ≈ 0.7071 - 0.001111 ≈ 0.7060.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7.

Then, (1/1000)*Sum ≈ 0.3177. And 1/π ≈ 0.3183, so that&#x27;s very close. So that checks out.

Similarly, for n = 1001 (odd), floor(n/2) = 500. Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1001). Let&#x27;s use the formula again.

θ = π/1001, m = 500.

Sum = [sin(500*(π/1001)/2)/sin(π/(2002))] * cos(501*(π/1001)/2)

Compute:

500*(π/1001)/2 ≈ (500/1001)*(π/2) ≈ 0.4995*(1.5708) ≈ 0.7841 radians.

sin(0.7841) ≈ sin(π/4 + a little) ≈ 0.7071 + something. Wait, 0.7841 radians is approximately 45 degrees + 0.7841 - 0.7854 ≈ 45 degrees - 0.0013 radians, so very close to π/4. So sin(0.7841) ≈ 0.7071.

Similarly, sin(π/(2002)) ≈ π/2002 ≈ 0.001570. 

Then, [sin(0.7841)/sin(0.001570)] ≈ 0.7071 / 0.001570 ≈ 450. 

Then, cos(501*(π/1001)/2) = cos(501π/2002). 501/2002 ≈ 0.25025. 0.25025*π ≈ 0.786 radians. So cos(0.786) ≈ 0.7060, similar to before.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7. Then (1/1001)*317.7 ≈ 0.3175, again close to 1/π ≈ 0.3183. So that also checks out.

Therefore, both even and odd cases give results approaching 1/π. So I can be confident that the limit is indeed 1/π. 

Just to recap, the key idea was recognizing that the given sum is a Riemann sum approximating the integral of cos(πx) from 0 to 1/2, which evaluates to 1/π. Additionally, verifying with the summation formula for cosines and checking specific numerical cases supported this conclusion. Therefore, the final answer is 1/π.

To evaluate the limit \[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\; \frac{1}{n}\;\sum_{k=1}^{\Big\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\Big\rfloor} \cos\Big(\frac{k\pi}{n}\Big), \] we recognize that as \( n \) approaches infinity, the upper limit \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \) can be approximated by \( \frac{n}{2} \). This allows us to consider the sum as a Riemann sum approximation of an integral.

The sum \( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) can be approximated by the integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \). This is because the terms \( \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) with \( x_k = \frac{k}{n} \) approximate the function \( \cos(\pi x) \) over the interval \( [0, \frac{1}{2}] \) with spacing \( \frac{1}{n} \).

The integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \) is computed as follows:
\[
\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} \cos(\pi x) \, dx = \left[ \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi} \right]_0^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - \sin(0)}{\pi} = \frac{1 - 0}{\pi} = \frac{1}{\\pi}.
\]

Thus, the limit is evaluated to be \( \frac{1}{\pi} \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First off, since n is going to infinity, the floor(n/2) is going to be roughly n/2. So maybe I can approximate the upper limit as n/2 instead of floor(n/2) for large n? I think that should be okay because as n becomes very large, the difference between floor(n/2) and n/2 becomes negligible relative to n. So that simplifies the problem a bit.

So, now the expression is approximately (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to n/2 of cos(kπ/n). Wait, but n is going to infinity, so maybe I can turn this sum into a Riemann sum? Because Riemann sums involve sums that approximate integrals when the number of terms goes to infinity, and here we have a sum with terms that could be seen as function evaluations at points spaced by 1/n apart. Let me check.

Let&#x27;s consider the sum (1/n) * sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). If I let x_k = k/n, then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(x_k π) * (1/n). So x_k ranges from 1/n to (n/2)/n = 1/2 as k goes from 1 to n/2. As n approaches infinity, the spacing between consecutive x_k&#x27;s is 1/n, which tends to zero. Therefore, this sum should approximate the integral of cos(πx) from x=0 to x=1/2.

Wait, but the sum starts at k=1, so x starts at 1/n, which approaches 0 as n becomes large. So the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx. Then the limit should be equal to that integral. Let me verify this intuition.

The Riemann sum for a function f(x) over [a, b] is given by sum_{k=1}^n f(a + kΔx) Δx, where Δx = (b - a)/n. In our case, if we consider the interval from 0 to 1/2, then Δx would be (1/2 - 0)/n = 1/(2n), but our sum is (1/n) sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). Wait, maybe I need to adjust variables here.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s make a substitution. Let’s set x = k/n, so when k=1, x=1/n, and when k= n/2, x=1/2. The spacing between consecutive x’s is 1/n. So the sum is sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(πx) * (1/n). This is like a Riemann sum with sample points at the right endpoints of each subinterval. But the interval of integration would be from x=0 to x=1/2. However, the first term is at x=1/n, so as n approaches infinity, the difference between the sum and the integral from 0 to 1/2 would go to zero. Therefore, the limit should indeed be the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx.

Let me compute that integral. The integral of cos(πx) dx is (1/π) sin(πx) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 1/2, we get (1/π)[sin(π*(1/2)) - sin(0)] = (1/π)[sin(π/2) - 0] = (1/π)(1) = 1/π. Therefore, the limit should be 1/π. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check the setup. The original problem is the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n), multiplied by 1/n. As n approaches infinity, floor(n/2) is approximately n/2, but for even and odd n, floor(n/2) is either exactly n/2 or (n-1)/2. However, as n becomes large, the difference between n/2 and (n-1)/2 is negligible. So treating the upper limit as n/2 is acceptable. 

But to be precise, when n is even, floor(n/2) = n/2, and when n is odd, floor(n/2) = (n-1)/2. However, in both cases, as n tends to infinity, floor(n/2)/n tends to 1/2. So whether we use n/2 or (n-1)/2, the upper limit of the sum divided by n approaches 1/2. Therefore, the approximation as a Riemann sum over the interval [0, 1/2] should hold.

Therefore, the original limit is equal to the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx, which is 1/π. So the answer should be 1/π, which is approximately 0.318... But let me confirm once again.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the sum explicitly and then take the limit. However, that might be more complicated. Let me recall that the sum of cosines can sometimes be expressed in closed form. The formula for the sum of cos(kθ) from k=1 to m is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m+1)θ/2). Let me check that formula.

Yes, the formula for the sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2). So maybe I can use this formula here. Let&#x27;s set θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s first handle the case when n is even. Let n = 2m. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Applying the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)) = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2)

Wait, maybe let me plug into the formula correctly. The formula is:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) = [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So here θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s take n even first: n = 2m. Then θ = π/(2m), and the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Then applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2). Wait, no, that&#x27;s not correct. Let me be precise.

Wait, in the formula, θ is the common difference. So in our case, θ = π/n. For n even, m = n/2. So the sum is from k=1 to m of cos(kθ) where θ = π/n. Therefore, applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

Substituting m = n/2, θ = π/n:

Sum = [sin((n/2)(π/n)/2) / sin((π/n)/2)] * cos(((n/2 + 1)(π/n))/2)

Simplify each part:

First, mθ/2 = (n/2)(π/n)/2 = (π/2)/2 = π/4

Denominator sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2n))

Second part: ((m + 1)θ)/2 = ((n/2 + 1)π/n)/2 = (π/2 + π/n)/2 = π/4 + π/(2n)

Therefore, Sum = [sin(π/4)/sin(π/(2n))] * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

So, sin(π/4) is √2/2, so:

Sum = (√2/2) / sin(π/(2n)) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

Therefore, the original expression is (1/n) * Sum = (1/n) * [√2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))]

Now, as n approaches infinity, π/(2n) approaches 0, so sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n). Therefore, sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n) - (π/(2n))^3/6 + ... So, 1/sin(π/(2n)) ≈ 2n/π (1 + (π^2)/(24n^2) + ... )

Therefore, √2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) ≈ √2/(2) * (2n/π) (1 + ...) = √2 n / π (1 + ...)

Then, cos(π/4 + π/(2n)) = cos(π/4)cos(π/(2n)) - sin(π/4)sin(π/(2n)) ≈ (√2/2)(1 - (π/(2n))^2/2) - (√2/2)(π/(2n)) ≈ √2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n) - higher order terms.

Multiplying these together:

[√2 n / π] * [√2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n)] ≈ (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) - (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) * π/(2n) + ... = (2n / (2π)) - (2n / (2π)) * π/(2n) + ... = n/π - (1/2) + ...

Then, multiplying by (1/n):

(1/n) * [n/π - 1/2 + ...] = 1/π - 1/(2n) + ... 

So as n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/π. So that checks out for even n.

Now, let&#x27;s check when n is odd. Let n = 2m + 1. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m + 1)). Applying the same formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2), where θ = π/(2m + 1)

So, substituting:

Sum = [sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) / sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ] * cos( (m + 1) * π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Simplify:

First term in numerator: sin(mπ/(2(2m + 1))) = sin( (2m^2 + m)π / (2(2m + 1)) )? Wait, no, wait: m * π / (2(2m + 1)) is just mπ/(2(2m + 1)).

Similarly, denominator: sin(π/(2(2m + 1)))

Second term: cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Let me see if as m becomes large (since n = 2m + 1 approaches infinity), we can approximate this.

Let me set m large, so n = 2m + 1 ≈ 2m. Then θ = π/(2m + 1) ≈ π/(2m). Let&#x27;s see:

Numerator: sin(mθ/2) = sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ sin(m * π/(4m)) = sin(π/4) = √2/2.

Denominator: sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ π/(4m).

Similarly, the cosine term: cos( (m + 1)θ/2 ) = cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ cos( (m)π/(4m) ) = cos(π/4) = √2/2.

Therefore, Sum ≈ [√2/2 / (π/(4m))] * √2/2 = [ (√2/2) * (4m/π) ) ] * (√2/2 ) = ( (4m/π) * (√2/2) ) * (√2/2 ) = (4m/π) * (2/4) ) = (4m/π) * (1/2) ) = 2m/π.

Then, since n ≈ 2m, m ≈ n/2, so Sum ≈ 2*(n/2)/π = n/π. Therefore, (1/n)*Sum ≈ 1/π, same as before. Therefore, whether n is even or odd, as n becomes large, the sum divided by n tends to 1/π. Therefore, the limit is 1/π. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 1/π.

But just to be thorough, let me check with specific large n. Let&#x27;s take n = 1000 (even). Then floor(n/2) = 500. The sum is sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000). Then (1/1000)*sum ≈ integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx = 1/π ≈ 0.318. Let me compute the sum numerically. 

Alternatively, using the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000) = [sin(500*(π/1000)/2)/sin(π/(2000))] * cos((500 + 1)*(π/1000)/2)

Wait, using the formula again. Let me compute this. So m = 500, θ = π/1000.

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So mθ/2 = 500*(π/1000)/2 = π/4, same as before. sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071.

sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2000)) ≈ π/2000 - (π/2000)^3/6. Let&#x27;s compute sin(π/2000): π ≈ 3.1416, so π/2000 ≈ 0.0015708. sin(0.0015708) ≈ 0.0015708 - (0.0015708)^3/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - (3.875e-9)/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - 6.458e-10 ≈ 0.0015708. So sin(π/2000) ≈ 0.0015708.

Then, [sin(π/4)/sin(π/2000)] ≈ (0.7071)/(0.0015708) ≈ 450. 

Then, cos((m + 1)θ/2) = cos(501*(π/1000)/2) = cos(501π/2000). 501π/2000 ≈ (500π + π)/2000 = π/4 + π/2000 ≈ 0.7854 + 0.0015708 ≈ 0.7870 radians. cos(0.7870) ≈ 0.7071 (since π/4 is 0.7854, cos(π/4) ≈ 0.7071). So cos(501π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - sin(π/4)*(π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - 0.7071*0.0015708 ≈ 0.7071 - 0.001111 ≈ 0.7060.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7.

Then, (1/1000)*Sum ≈ 0.3177. And 1/π ≈ 0.3183, so that&#x27;s very close. So that checks out.

Similarly, for n = 1001 (odd), floor(n/2) = 500. Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1001). Let&#x27;s use the formula again.

θ = π/1001, m = 500.

Sum = [sin(500*(π/1001)/2)/sin(π/(2002))] * cos(501*(π/1001)/2)

Compute:

500*(π/1001)/2 ≈ (500/1001)*(π/2) ≈ 0.4995*(1.5708) ≈ 0.7841 radians.

sin(0.7841) ≈ sin(π/4 + a little) ≈ 0.7071 + something. Wait, 0.7841 radians is approximately 45 degrees + 0.7841 - 0.7854 ≈ 45 degrees - 0.0013 radians, so very close to π/4. So sin(0.7841) ≈ 0.7071.

Similarly, sin(π/(2002)) ≈ π/2002 ≈ 0.001570. 

Then, [sin(0.7841)/sin(0.001570)] ≈ 0.7071 / 0.001570 ≈ 450. 

Then, cos(501*(π/1001)/2) = cos(501π/2002). 501/2002 ≈ 0.25025. 0.25025*π ≈ 0.786 radians. So cos(0.786) ≈ 0.7060, similar to before.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7. Then (1/1001)*317.7 ≈ 0.3175, again close to 1/π ≈ 0.3183. So that also checks out.

Therefore, both even and odd cases give results approaching 1/π. So I can be confident that the limit is indeed 1/π. 

Just to recap, the key idea was recognizing that the given sum is a Riemann sum approximating the integral of cos(πx) from 0 to 1/2, which evaluates to 1/π. Additionally, verifying with the summation formula for cosines and checking specific numerical cases supported this conclusion. Therefore, the final answer is 1/π.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{\pi}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\; \frac{1}{n}\;\sum_{k=1}^{\Big\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\Big\rfloor} \cos\Big(\frac{k\pi}{n}\Big), \] we recognize that as \( n \) approaches infinity, the upper limit \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \) can be approximated by \( \frac{n}{2} \). This allows us to consider the sum as a Riemann sum approximation of an integral.

The sum \( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) can be approximated by the integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \). This is because the terms \( \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) with \( x_k = \frac{k}{n} \) approximate the function \( \cos(\pi x) \) over the interval \( [0, \frac{1}{2}] \) with spacing \( \frac{1}{n} \).

The integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \) is computed as follows:
\[
\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} \cos(\pi x) \, dx = \left[ \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi} \right]_0^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - \sin(0)}{\pi} = \frac{1 - 0}{\pi} = \frac{1}{\\pi}.
\]

Thus, the limit is evaluated to be \( \frac{1}{\pi} \).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Let&#x27;s consider the sum (1/n) * sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). If I let x_k = k/n, then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(x_k π) * (1/n). So x_k ranges from 1/n to (n/2)/n = 1/2 as k goes from 1 to n/2. As n approaches infinity, the spacing between consecutive x_k&#x27;s is 1/n, which tends to zero. Therefore, this sum should approximate the integral of cos(πx) from x=0 to x=1/2.

Wait, but the sum starts at k=1, so x starts at 1/n, which approaches 0 as n becomes large. So the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx. Then the limit should be equal to that integral. Let me verify this intuition.

The Riemann sum for a function f(x) over [a, b] is given by sum_{k=1}^n f(a + kΔx) Δx, where Δx = (b - a)/n. In our case, if we consider the interval from 0 to 1/2, then Δx would be (1/2 - 0)/n = 1/(2n), but our sum is (1/n) sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). Wait, maybe I need to adjust variables here.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s make a substitution. Let’s set x = k/n, so when k=1, x=1/n, and when k= n/2, x=1/2. The spacing between consecutive x’s is 1/n.

Let me compute that integral. The integral of cos(πx) dx is (1/π) sin(πx) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 1/2, we get (1/π)[sin(π*(1/2)) - sin(0)] = (1/π)[sin(π/2) - 0] = (1/π)(1) = 1/π. Therefore, the limit should be 1/π.

So whether we use n/2 or (n-1)/2, the upper limit of the sum divided by n approaches 1/2. Therefore, the approximation as a Riemann sum over the interval [0, 1/2] should hold.

Therefore, the original limit is equal to the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx, which is 1/π. So the answer should be 1/π, which is approximately 0.318... But let me confirm once again.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the sum explicitly and then take the limit. However, that might be more complicated. Let me recall that the sum of cosines can sometimes be expressed in closed form. The formula for the sum of cos(kθ) from k=1 to m is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m+1)θ/2). Let me check that formula.

Let&#x27;s first handle the case when n is even. Let n = 2m. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Applying the formula:

Wait, maybe let me plug into the formula correctly. The formula is:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) = [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So here θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s take n even first: n = 2m. Then θ = π/(2m), and the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Then applying the formula:

Substituting m = n/2, θ = π/n:

Simplify each part:

First, mθ/2 = (n/2)(π/n)/2 = (π/2)/2 = π/4

Denominator sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2n))

Second part: ((m + 1)θ)/2 = ((n/2 + 1)π/n)/2 = (π/2 + π/n)/2 = π/4 + π/(2n)

Therefore, Sum = [sin(π/4)/sin(π/(2n))] * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

So, sin(π/4) is √2/2, so:

Sum = (√2/2) / sin(π/(2n)) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

Therefore, the original expression is (1/n) * Sum = (1/n) * [√2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))]

Now, as n approaches infinity, π/(2n) approaches 0, so sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n). Therefore, sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n) - (π/(2n))^3/6 + ... So, 1/sin(π/(2n)) ≈ 2n/π (1 + (π^2)/(24n^2) + ... )

Therefore, √2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) ≈ √2/(2) * (2n/π) (1 + ...) = √2 n / π (1 + ...)

Then, cos(π/4 + π/(2n)) = cos(π/4)cos(π/(2n)) - sin(π/4)sin(π/(2n)) ≈ (√2/2)(1 - (π/(2n))^2/2) - (√2/2)(π/(2n)) ≈ √2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n) - higher order terms.

Multiplying these together:

[√2 n / π] * [√2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n)] ≈ (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) - (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) * π/(2n) + ... = (2n / (2π)) - (2n / (2π)) * π/(2n) + ... = n/π - (1/2) + ...

Then, multiplying by (1/n):

(1/n) * [n/π - 1/2 + ...] = 1/π - 1/(2n) + ... 

So as n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/π. So that checks out for even n.

Now, let&#x27;s check when n is odd. Let n = 2m + 1. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m + 1)). Applying the same formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2), where θ = π/(2m + 1)

So, substituting:

Sum = [sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) / sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ] * cos( (m + 1) * π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Simplify:

First term in numerator: sin(mπ/(2(2m + 1))) = sin( (2m^2 + m)π / (2(2m + 1)) )? Wait, no, wait: m * π / (2(2m + 1)) is just mπ/(2(2m + 1)).

Similarly, denominator: sin(π/(2(2m + 1)))

Second term: cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Let me see if as m becomes large (since n = 2m + 1 approaches infinity), we can approximate this.

Let me set m large, so n = 2m + 1 ≈ 2m. Then θ = π/(2m + 1) ≈ π/(2m). Let&#x27;s see:

Numerator: sin(mθ/2) = sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ sin(m * π/(4m)) = sin(π/4) = √2/2.

Denominator: sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ π/(4m).

Similarly, the cosine term: cos( (m + 1)θ/2 ) = cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ cos( (m)π/(4m) ) = cos(π/4) = √2/2.

Therefore, Sum ≈ [√2/2 / (π/(4m))] * √2/2 = [ (√2/2) * (4m/π) ) ] * (√2/2 ) = ( (4m/π) * (√2/2) ) * (√2/2 ) = (4m/π) * (2/4) ) = (4m/π) * (1/2) ) = 2m/π.

Then, since n ≈ 2m, m ≈ n/2, so Sum ≈ 2*(n/2)/π = n/π. Therefore, (1/n)*Sum ≈ 1/π, same as before. Therefore, whether n is even or odd, as n becomes large, the sum divided by n tends to 1/π. Therefore, the limit is 1/π. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 1/π.

But just to be thorough, let me check with specific large n. Let&#x27;s take n = 1000 (even). Then floor(n/2) = 500. The sum is sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000). Then (1/1000)*sum ≈ integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx = 1/π ≈ 0.318. Let me compute the sum numerically. 

Alternatively, using the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000) = [sin(500*(π/1000)/2)/sin(π/(2000))] * cos((500 + 1)*(π/1000)/2)

Wait, using the formula again. Let me compute this. So m = 500, θ = π/1000.

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So mθ/2 = 500*(π/1000)/2 = π/4, same as before. sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071.

sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2000)) ≈ π/2000 - (π/2000)^3/6. Let&#x27;s compute sin(π/2000): π ≈ 3.1416, so π/2000 ≈ 0.0015708. sin(0.0015708) ≈ 0.0015708 - (0.0015708)^3/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - (3.875e-9)/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - 6.458e-10 ≈ 0.0015708. So sin(π/2000) ≈ 0.0015708.

Then, [sin(π/4)/sin(π/2000)] ≈ (0.7071)/(0.0015708) ≈ 450. 

Then, cos((m + 1)θ/2) = cos(501*(π/1000)/2) = cos(501π/2000). 501π/2000 ≈ (500π + π)/2000 = π/4 + π/2000 ≈ 0.7854 + 0.0015708 ≈ 0.7870 radians. cos(0.7870) ≈ 0.7071 (since π/4 is 0.7854, cos(π/4) ≈ 0.7071). So cos(501π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - sin(π/4)*(π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - 0.7071*0.0015708 ≈ 0.7071 - 0.001111 ≈ 0.7060.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7.

Then, (1/1000)*Sum ≈ 0.3177. And 1/π ≈ 0.3183, so that&#x27;s very close. So that checks out.

Similarly, for n = 1001 (odd), floor(n/2) = 500. Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1001). Let&#x27;s use the formula again.

θ = π/1001, m = 500.

Sum = [sin(500*(π/1001)/2)/sin(π/(2002))] * cos(501*(π/1001)/2)

Compute:

500*(π/1001)/2 ≈ (500/1001)*(π/2) ≈ 0.4995*(1.5708) ≈ 0.7841 radians.

sin(0.7841) ≈ sin(π/4 + a little) ≈ 0.7071 + something. Wait, 0.7841 radians is approximately 45 degrees + 0.7841 - 0.7854 ≈ 45 degrees - 0.0013 radians, so very close to π/4. So sin(0.7841) ≈ 0.7071.

Similarly, sin(π/(2002)) ≈ π/2002 ≈ 0.001570. 

Then, [sin(0.7841)/sin(0.001570)] ≈ 0.7071 / 0.001570 ≈ 450. 

Then, cos(501*(π/1001)/2) = cos(501π/2002). 501/2002 ≈ 0.25025. 0.25025*π ≈ 0.786 radians. So cos(0.786) ≈ 0.7060, similar to before.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7. Then (1/1001)*317.7 ≈ 0.3175, again close to 1/π ≈ 0.3183. So that also checks out.

Therefore, both even and odd cases give results approaching 1/π. So I can be confident that the limit is indeed 1/π. 

Just to recap, the key idea was recognizing that the given sum is a Riemann sum approximating the integral of cos(πx) from 0 to 1/2, which evaluates to 1/π. Additionally, verifying with the summation formula for cosines and checking specific numerical cases supported this conclusion. Therefore, the final answer is 1/π.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{\pi}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\; \frac{1}{n}\;\sum_{k=1}^{\Big\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\Big\rfloor} \cos\Big(\frac{k\pi}{n}\Big), \] we recognize that as \( n \) approaches infinity, the upper limit \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \) can be approximated by \( \frac{n}{2} \). This allows us to consider the sum as a Riemann sum approximation of an integral.

The sum \( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) can be approximated by the integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \). This is because the terms \( \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) with \( x_k = \frac{k}{n} \) approximate the function \( \cos(\pi x) \) over the interval \( [0, \frac{1}{2}] \) with spacing \( \frac{1}{n} \).

The integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \) is computed as follows:
\[
\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} \cos(\pi x) \, dx = \left[ \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi} \right]_0^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - \sin(0)}{\pi} = \frac{1 - 0}{\pi} = \frac{1}{\\pi}.
\]

Thus, the limit is evaluated to be \( \frac{1}{\pi} \).

\[

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First off, since n is going to infinity, the floor(n/2) is going to be roughly n/2. So maybe I can approximate the upper limit as n/2 instead of floor(n/2) for large n? I think that should be okay because as n becomes very large, the difference between floor(n/2) and n/2 becomes negligible relative to n. So that simplifies the problem a bit.

So, now the expression is approximately (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to n/2 of cos(kπ/n). Wait, but n is going to infinity, so maybe I can turn this sum into a Riemann sum? Because Riemann sums involve sums that approximate integrals when the number of terms goes to infinity, and here we have a sum with terms that could be seen as function evaluations at points spaced by 1/n apart. Let me check.

Let&#x27;s consider the sum (1/n) * sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). If I let x_k = k/n, then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(x_k π) * (1/n). So x_k ranges from 1/n to (n/2)/n = 1/2 as k goes from 1 to n/2. As n approaches infinity, the spacing between consecutive x_k&#x27;s is 1/n, which tends to zero. Therefore, this sum should approximate the integral of cos(πx) from x=0 to x=1/2.

Wait, but the sum starts at k=1, so x starts at 1/n, which approaches 0 as n becomes large. So the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx. Then the limit should be equal to that integral. Let me verify this intuition.

The Riemann sum for a function f(x) over [a, b] is given by sum_{k=1}^n f(a + kΔx) Δx, where Δx = (b - a)/n. In our case, if we consider the interval from 0 to 1/2, then Δx would be (1/2 - 0)/n = 1/(2n), but our sum is (1/n) sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). Wait, maybe I need to adjust variables here.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s make a substitution. Let’s set x = k/n, so when k=1, x=1/n, and when k= n/2, x=1/2. The spacing between consecutive x’s is 1/n. So the sum is sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(πx) * (1/n). This is like a Riemann sum with sample points at the right endpoints of each subinterval. But the interval of integration would be from x=0 to x=1/2. However, the first term is at x=1/n, so as n approaches infinity, the difference between the sum and the integral from 0 to 1/2 would go to zero. Therefore, the limit should indeed be the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx.

Let me compute that integral. The integral of cos(πx) dx is (1/π) sin(πx) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 1/2, we get (1/π)[sin(π*(1/2)) - sin(0)] = (1/π)[sin(π/2) - 0] = (1/π)(1) = 1/π. Therefore, the limit should be 1/π. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check the setup. The original problem is the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n), multiplied by 1/n. As n approaches infinity, floor(n/2) is approximately n/2, but for even and odd n, floor(n/2) is either exactly n/2 or (n-1)/2. However, as n becomes large, the difference between n/2 and (n-1)/2 is negligible. So treating the upper limit as n/2 is acceptable. 

But to be precise, when n is even, floor(n/2) = n/2, and when n is odd, floor(n/2) = (n-1)/2. However, in both cases, as n tends to infinity, floor(n/2)/n tends to 1/2. So whether we use n/2 or (n-1)/2, the upper limit of the sum divided by n approaches 1/2. Therefore, the approximation as a Riemann sum over the interval [0, 1/2] should hold.

Therefore, the original limit is equal to the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx, which is 1/π. So the answer should be 1/π, which is approximately 0.318... But let me confirm once again.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the sum explicitly and then take the limit. However, that might be more complicated. Let me recall that the sum of cosines can sometimes be expressed in closed form. The formula for the sum of cos(kθ) from k=1 to m is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m+1)θ/2). Let me check that formula.

Yes, the formula for the sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2). So maybe I can use this formula here. Let&#x27;s set θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s first handle the case when n is even. Let n = 2m. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Applying the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)) = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2)

Wait, maybe let me plug into the formula correctly. The formula is:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) = [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So here θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s take n even first: n = 2m. Then θ = π/(2m), and the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Then applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2). Wait, no, that&#x27;s not correct. Let me be precise.

Wait, in the formula, θ is the common difference. So in our case, θ = π/n. For n even, m = n/2. So the sum is from k=1 to m of cos(kθ) where θ = π/n. Therefore, applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

Substituting m = n/2, θ = π/n:

Sum = [sin((n/2)(π/n)/2) / sin((π/n)/2)] * cos(((n/2 + 1)(π/n))/2)

Simplify each part:

First, mθ/2 = (n/2)(π/n)/2 = (π/2)/2 = π/4

Denominator sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2n))

Second part: ((m + 1)θ)/2 = ((n/2 + 1)π/n)/2 = (π/2 + π/n)/2 = π/4 + π/(2n)

Therefore, Sum = [sin(π/4)/sin(π/(2n))] * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

So, sin(π/4) is √2/2, so:

Sum = (√2/2) / sin(π/(2n)) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

Therefore, the original expression is (1/n) * Sum = (1/n) * [√2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))]

Now, as n approaches infinity, π/(2n) approaches 0, so sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n). Therefore, sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n) - (π/(2n))^3/6 + ... So, 1/sin(π/(2n)) ≈ 2n/π (1 + (π^2)/(24n^2) + ... )

Therefore, √2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) ≈ √2/(2) * (2n/π) (1 + ...) = √2 n / π (1 + ...)

Then, cos(π/4 + π/(2n)) = cos(π/4)cos(π/(2n)) - sin(π/4)sin(π/(2n)) ≈ (√2/2)(1 - (π/(2n))^2/2) - (√2/2)(π/(2n)) ≈ √2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n) - higher order terms.

Multiplying these together:

[√2 n / π] * [√2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n)] ≈ (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) - (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) * π/(2n) + ... = (2n / (2π)) - (2n / (2π)) * π/(2n) + ... = n/π - (1/2) + ...

Then, multiplying by (1/n):

(1/n) * [n/π - 1/2 + ...] = 1/π - 1/(2n) + ... 

So as n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/π. So that checks out for even n.

Now, let&#x27;s check when n is odd. Let n = 2m + 1. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m + 1)). Applying the same formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2), where θ = π/(2m + 1)

So, substituting:

Sum = [sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) / sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ] * cos( (m + 1) * π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Simplify:

First term in numerator: sin(mπ/(2(2m + 1))) = sin( (2m^2 + m)π / (2(2m + 1)) )? Wait, no, wait: m * π / (2(2m + 1)) is just mπ/(2(2m + 1)).

Similarly, denominator: sin(π/(2(2m + 1)))

Second term: cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Let me see if as m becomes large (since n = 2m + 1 approaches infinity), we can approximate this.

Let me set m large, so n = 2m + 1 ≈ 2m. Then θ = π/(2m + 1) ≈ π/(2m). Let&#x27;s see:

Numerator: sin(mθ/2) = sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ sin(m * π/(4m)) = sin(π/4) = √2/2.

Denominator: sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ π/(4m).

Similarly, the cosine term: cos( (m + 1)θ/2 ) = cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ cos( (m)π/(4m) ) = cos(π/4) = √2/2.

Therefore, Sum ≈ [√2/2 / (π/(4m))] * √2/2 = [ (√2/2) * (4m/π) ) ] * (√2/2 ) = ( (4m/π) * (√2/2) ) * (√2/2 ) = (4m/π) * (2/4) ) = (4m/π) * (1/2) ) = 2m/π.

Then, since n ≈ 2m, m ≈ n/2, so Sum ≈ 2*(n/2)/π = n/π. Therefore, (1/n)*Sum ≈ 1/π, same as before. Therefore, whether n is even or odd, as n becomes large, the sum divided by n tends to 1/π. Therefore, the limit is 1/π. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 1/π.

But just to be thorough, let me check with specific large n. Let&#x27;s take n = 1000 (even). Then floor(n/2) = 500. The sum is sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000). Then (1/1000)*sum ≈ integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx = 1/π ≈ 0.318. Let me compute the sum numerically. 

Alternatively, using the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000) = [sin(500*(π/1000)/2)/sin(π/(2000))] * cos((500 + 1)*(π/1000)/2)

Wait, using the formula again. Let me compute this. So m = 500, θ = π/1000.

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So mθ/2 = 500*(π/1000)/2 = π/4, same as before. sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071.

sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2000)) ≈ π/2000 - (π/2000)^3/6. Let&#x27;s compute sin(π/2000): π ≈ 3.1416, so π/2000 ≈ 0.0015708. sin(0.0015708) ≈ 0.0015708 - (0.0015708)^3/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - (3.875e-9)/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - 6.458e-10 ≈ 0.0015708. So sin(π/2000) ≈ 0.0015708.

Then, [sin(π/4)/sin(π/2000)] ≈ (0.7071)/(0.0015708) ≈ 450. 

Then, cos((m + 1)θ/2) = cos(501*(π/1000)/2) = cos(501π/2000). 501π/2000 ≈ (500π + π)/2000 = π/4 + π/2000 ≈ 0.7854 + 0.0015708 ≈ 0.7870 radians. cos(0.7870) ≈ 0.7071 (since π/4 is 0.7854, cos(π/4) ≈ 0.7071). So cos(501π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - sin(π/4)*(π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - 0.7071*0.0015708 ≈ 0.7071 - 0.001111 ≈ 0.7060.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7.

Then, (1/1000)*Sum ≈ 0.3177. And 1/π ≈ 0.3183, so that&#x27;s very close. So that checks out.

Similarly, for n = 1001 (odd), floor(n/2) = 500. Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1001). Let&#x27;s use the formula again.

θ = π/1001, m = 500.

Sum = [sin(500*(π/1001)/2)/sin(π/(2002))] * cos(501*(π/1001)/2)

Compute:

500*(π/1001)/2 ≈ (500/1001)*(π/2) ≈ 0.4995*(1.5708) ≈ 0.7841 radians.

sin(0.7841) ≈ sin(π/4 + a little) ≈ 0.7071 + something. Wait, 0.7841 radians is approximately 45 degrees + 0.7841 - 0.7854 ≈ 45 degrees - 0.0013 radians, so very close to π/4. So sin(0.7841) ≈ 0.7071.

Similarly, sin(π/(2002)) ≈ π/2002 ≈ 0.001570. 

Then, [sin(0.7841)/sin(0.001570)] ≈ 0.7071 / 0.001570 ≈ 450. 

Then, cos(501*(π/1001)/2) = cos(501π/2002). 501/2002 ≈ 0.25025. 0.25025*π ≈ 0.786 radians. So cos(0.786) ≈ 0.7060, similar to before.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7. Then (1/1001)*317.7 ≈ 0.3175, again close to 1/π ≈ 0.3183. So that also checks out.

Therefore, both even and odd cases give results approaching 1/π. So I can be confident that the limit is indeed 1/π. 

Just to recap, the key idea was recognizing that the given sum is a Riemann sum approximating the integral of cos(πx) from 0 to 1/2, which evaluates to 1/π. Additionally, verifying with the summation formula for cosines and checking specific numerical cases supported this conclusion. Therefore, the final answer is 1/π.

\boxed{\dfrac{1}{\pi}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\; \frac{1}{n}\;\sum_{k=1}^{\Big\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\Big\rfloor} \cos\Big(\frac{k\pi}{n}\Big), \] we recognize that as \( n \) approaches infinity, the upper limit \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \) can be approximated by \( \frac{n}{2} \). This allows us to consider the sum as a Riemann sum approximation of an integral.

The sum \( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) can be approximated by the integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \). This is because the terms \( \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) with \( x_k = \frac{k}{n} \) approximate the function \( \cos(\pi x) \) over the interval \( [0, \frac{1}{2}] \) with spacing \( \frac{1}{n} \).

The integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \) is computed as follows:
\[
\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} \cos(\pi x) \, dx = \left[ \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi} \right]_0^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - \sin(0)}{\pi} = \frac{1 - 0}{\pi} = \frac{1}{\\pi}.
\]

Thus, the limit is evaluated to be \( \frac{1}{\pi} \).

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{\pi}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as n approaches infinity of (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First off, since n is going to infinity, the floor(n/2) is going to be roughly n/2. So maybe I can approximate the upper limit as n/2 instead of floor(n/2) for large n? I think that should be okay because as n becomes very large, the difference between floor(n/2) and n/2 becomes negligible relative to n. So that simplifies the problem a bit.

So, now the expression is approximately (1/n) times the sum from k=1 to n/2 of cos(kπ/n). Wait, but n is going to infinity, so maybe I can turn this sum into a Riemann sum? Because Riemann sums involve sums that approximate integrals when the number of terms goes to infinity, and here we have a sum with terms that could be seen as function evaluations at points spaced by 1/n apart. Let me check.

Let&#x27;s consider the sum (1/n) * sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). If I let x_k = k/n, then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(x_k π) * (1/n). So x_k ranges from 1/n to (n/2)/n = 1/2 as k goes from 1 to n/2. As n approaches infinity, the spacing between consecutive x_k&#x27;s is 1/n, which tends to zero. Therefore, this sum should approximate the integral of cos(πx) from x=0 to x=1/2.

Wait, but the sum starts at k=1, so x starts at 1/n, which approaches 0 as n becomes large. So the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx. Then the limit should be equal to that integral. Let me verify this intuition.

The Riemann sum for a function f(x) over [a, b] is given by sum_{k=1}^n f(a + kΔx) Δx, where Δx = (b - a)/n. In our case, if we consider the interval from 0 to 1/2, then Δx would be (1/2 - 0)/n = 1/(2n), but our sum is (1/n) sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). Wait, maybe I need to adjust variables here.

Alternatively, let&#x27;s make a substitution. Let’s set x = k/n, so when k=1, x=1/n, and when k= n/2, x=1/2. The spacing between consecutive x’s is 1/n. So the sum is sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(πx) * (1/n). This is like a Riemann sum with sample points at the right endpoints of each subinterval. But the interval of integration would be from x=0 to x=1/2. However, the first term is at x=1/n, so as n approaches infinity, the difference between the sum and the integral from 0 to 1/2 would go to zero. Therefore, the limit should indeed be the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx.

Let me compute that integral. The integral of cos(πx) dx is (1/π) sin(πx) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 1/2, we get (1/π)[sin(π*(1/2)) - sin(0)] = (1/π)[sin(π/2) - 0] = (1/π)(1) = 1/π. Therefore, the limit should be 1/π. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check the setup. The original problem is the sum from k=1 to floor(n/2) of cos(kπ/n), multiplied by 1/n. As n approaches infinity, floor(n/2) is approximately n/2, but for even and odd n, floor(n/2) is either exactly n/2 or (n-1)/2. However, as n becomes large, the difference between n/2 and (n-1)/2 is negligible. So treating the upper limit as n/2 is acceptable. 

But to be precise, when n is even, floor(n/2) = n/2, and when n is odd, floor(n/2) = (n-1)/2. However, in both cases, as n tends to infinity, floor(n/2)/n tends to 1/2. So whether we use n/2 or (n-1)/2, the upper limit of the sum divided by n approaches 1/2. Therefore, the approximation as a Riemann sum over the interval [0, 1/2] should hold.

Therefore, the original limit is equal to the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx, which is 1/π. So the answer should be 1/π, which is approximately 0.318... But let me confirm once again.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the sum explicitly and then take the limit. However, that might be more complicated. Let me recall that the sum of cosines can sometimes be expressed in closed form. The formula for the sum of cos(kθ) from k=1 to m is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m+1)θ/2). Let me check that formula.

Yes, the formula for the sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) is [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2). So maybe I can use this formula here. Let&#x27;s set θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s first handle the case when n is even. Let n = 2m. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Applying the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)) = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2)

Wait, maybe let me plug into the formula correctly. The formula is:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) = [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So here θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s take n even first: n = 2m. Then θ = π/(2m), and the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Then applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2). Wait, no, that&#x27;s not correct. Let me be precise.

Wait, in the formula, θ is the common difference. So in our case, θ = π/n. For n even, m = n/2. So the sum is from k=1 to m of cos(kθ) where θ = π/n. Therefore, applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

Substituting m = n/2, θ = π/n:

Sum = [sin((n/2)(π/n)/2) / sin((π/n)/2)] * cos(((n/2 + 1)(π/n))/2)

Simplify each part:

First, mθ/2 = (n/2)(π/n)/2 = (π/2)/2 = π/4

Denominator sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2n))

Second part: ((m + 1)θ)/2 = ((n/2 + 1)π/n)/2 = (π/2 + π/n)/2 = π/4 + π/(2n)

Therefore, Sum = [sin(π/4)/sin(π/(2n))] * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

So, sin(π/4) is √2/2, so:

Sum = (√2/2) / sin(π/(2n)) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

Therefore, the original expression is (1/n) * Sum = (1/n) * [√2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))]

Now, as n approaches infinity, π/(2n) approaches 0, so sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n). Therefore, sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n) - (π/(2n))^3/6 + ... So, 1/sin(π/(2n)) ≈ 2n/π (1 + (π^2)/(24n^2) + ... )

Therefore, √2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) ≈ √2/(2) * (2n/π) (1 + ...) = √2 n / π (1 + ...)

Then, cos(π/4 + π/(2n)) = cos(π/4)cos(π/(2n)) - sin(π/4)sin(π/(2n)) ≈ (√2/2)(1 - (π/(2n))^2/2) - (√2/2)(π/(2n)) ≈ √2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n) - higher order terms.

Multiplying these together:

[√2 n / π] * [√2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n)] ≈ (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) - (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) * π/(2n) + ... = (2n / (2π)) - (2n / (2π)) * π/(2n) + ... = n/π - (1/2) + ...

Then, multiplying by (1/n):

(1/n) * [n/π - 1/2 + ...] = 1/π - 1/(2n) + ... 

So as n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/π. So that checks out for even n.

Now, let&#x27;s check when n is odd. Let n = 2m + 1. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m + 1)). Applying the same formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2), where θ = π/(2m + 1)

So, substituting:

Sum = [sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) / sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ] * cos( (m + 1) * π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Simplify:

First term in numerator: sin(mπ/(2(2m + 1))) = sin( (2m^2 + m)π / (2(2m + 1)) )? Wait, no, wait: m * π / (2(2m + 1)) is just mπ/(2(2m + 1)).

Similarly, denominator: sin(π/(2(2m + 1)))

Second term: cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Let me see if as m becomes large (since n = 2m + 1 approaches infinity), we can approximate this.

Let me set m large, so n = 2m + 1 ≈ 2m. Then θ = π/(2m + 1) ≈ π/(2m). Let&#x27;s see:

Numerator: sin(mθ/2) = sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ sin(m * π/(4m)) = sin(π/4) = √2/2.

Denominator: sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ π/(4m).

Similarly, the cosine term: cos( (m + 1)θ/2 ) = cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ cos( (m)π/(4m) ) = cos(π/4) = √2/2.

Therefore, Sum ≈ [√2/2 / (π/(4m))] * √2/2 = [ (√2/2) * (4m/π) ) ] * (√2/2 ) = ( (4m/π) * (√2/2) ) * (√2/2 ) = (4m/π) * (2/4) ) = (4m/π) * (1/2) ) = 2m/π.

Then, since n ≈ 2m, m ≈ n/2, so Sum ≈ 2*(n/2)/π = n/π. Therefore, (1/n)*Sum ≈ 1/π, same as before. Therefore, whether n is even or odd, as n becomes large, the sum divided by n tends to 1/π. Therefore, the limit is 1/π. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 1/π.

But just to be thorough, let me check with specific large n. Let&#x27;s take n = 1000 (even). Then floor(n/2) = 500. The sum is sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000). Then (1/1000)*sum ≈ integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx = 1/π ≈ 0.318. Let me compute the sum numerically. 

Alternatively, using the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000) = [sin(500*(π/1000)/2)/sin(π/(2000))] * cos((500 + 1)*(π/1000)/2)

Wait, using the formula again. Let me compute this. So m = 500, θ = π/1000.

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So mθ/2 = 500*(π/1000)/2 = π/4, same as before. sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071.

sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2000)) ≈ π/2000 - (π/2000)^3/6. Let&#x27;s compute sin(π/2000): π ≈ 3.1416, so π/2000 ≈ 0.0015708. sin(0.0015708) ≈ 0.0015708 - (0.0015708)^3/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - (3.875e-9)/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - 6.458e-10 ≈ 0.0015708. So sin(π/2000) ≈ 0.0015708.

Then, [sin(π/4)/sin(π/2000)] ≈ (0.7071)/(0.0015708) ≈ 450. 

Then, cos((m + 1)θ/2) = cos(501*(π/1000)/2) = cos(501π/2000). 501π/2000 ≈ (500π + π)/2000 = π/4 + π/2000 ≈ 0.7854 + 0.0015708 ≈ 0.7870 radians. cos(0.7870) ≈ 0.7071 (since π/4 is 0.7854, cos(π/4) ≈ 0.7071). So cos(501π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - sin(π/4)*(π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - 0.7071*0.0015708 ≈ 0.7071 - 0.001111 ≈ 0.7060.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7.

Then, (1/1000)*Sum ≈ 0.3177. And 1/π ≈ 0.3183, so that&#x27;s very close. So that checks out.

Similarly, for n = 1001 (odd), floor(n/2) = 500. Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1001). Let&#x27;s use the formula again.

θ = π/1001, m = 500.

Sum = [sin(500*(π/1001)/2)/sin(π/(2002))] * cos(501*(π/1001)/2)

Compute:

500*(π/1001)/2 ≈ (500/1001)*(π/2) ≈ 0.4995*(1.5708) ≈ 0.7841 radians.

sin(0.7841) ≈ sin(π/4 + a little) ≈ 0.7071 + something. Wait, 0.7841 radians is approximately 45 degrees + 0.7841 - 0.7854 ≈ 45 degrees - 0.0013 radians, so very close to π/4. So sin(0.7841) ≈ 0.7071.

Similarly, sin(π/(2002)) ≈ π/2002 ≈ 0.001570. 

Then, [sin(0.7841)/sin(0.001570)] ≈ 0.7071 / 0.001570 ≈ 450. 

Then, cos(501*(π/1001)/2) = cos(501π/2002). 501/2002 ≈ 0.25025. 0.25025*π ≈ 0.786 radians. So cos(0.786) ≈ 0.7060, similar to before.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7. Then (1/1001)*317.7 ≈ 0.3175, again close to 1/π ≈ 0.3183. So that also checks out.

Therefore, both even and odd cases give results approaching 1/π. So I can be confident that the limit is indeed 1/π. 

Just to recap, the key idea was recognizing that the given sum is a Riemann sum approximating the integral of cos(πx) from 0 to 1/2, which evaluates to 1/π. Additionally, verifying with the summation formula for cosines and checking specific numerical cases supported this conclusion. Therefore, the final answer is 1/π.

\boxed{\dfrac{1}{\pi}}

To evaluate the limit \[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\; \frac{1}{n}\;\sum_{k=1}^{\Big\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\Big\rfloor} \cos\Big(\frac{k\pi}{n}\Big), \] we recognize that as \( n \) approaches infinity, the upper limit \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \) can be approximated by \( \frac{n}{2} \). This allows us to consider the sum as a Riemann sum approximation of an integral.

The sum \( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) can be approximated by the integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \). This is because the terms \( \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) with \( x_k = \frac{k}{n} \) approximate the function \( \cos(\pi x) \) over the interval \( [0, \frac{1}{2}] \) with spacing \( \frac{1}{n} \).

The integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \) is computed as follows:
\[
\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} \cos(\pi x) \, dx = \left[ \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi} \right]_0^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - \sin(0)}{\pi} = \frac{1 - 0}{\pi} = \frac{1}{\\pi}.
\]

Thus, the limit is evaluated to be \( \frac{1}{\pi} \).

Let me check.

Let&#x27;s consider the sum (1/n) * sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). If I let x_k = k/n, then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(x_k π) * (1/n). So x_k ranges from 1/n to (n/2)/n = 1/2 as k goes from 1 to n/2. As n approaches infinity, the spacing between consecutive x_k&#x27;s is 1/n, which tends to zero. Therefore, this sum should approximate the integral of cos(πx) from x=0 to x=1/2.

The Riemann sum for a function f(x) over [a, b] is given by sum_{k=1}^n f(a + kΔx) Δx, where Δx = (b - a)/n. In our case, if we consider the interval from 0 to 1/2, then Δx would be (1/2 - 0)/n = 1/(2n), but our sum is (1/n) sum_{k=1}^{n/2} cos(kπ/n). Wait, maybe I need to adjust variables here.

Let me compute that integral. The integral of cos(πx) dx is (1/π) sin(πx) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 1/2, we get (1/π)[sin(π*(1/2)) - sin(0)] = (1/π)[sin(π/2) - 0] = (1/π)(1) = 1/π. Therefore, the limit should be 1/π.

So whether we use n/2 or (n-1)/2, the upper limit of the sum divided by n approaches 1/2. Therefore, the approximation as a Riemann sum over the interval [0, 1/2] should hold.

Therefore, the original limit is equal to the integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx, which is 1/π. So the answer should be 1/π, which is approximately 0.318... But let me confirm once again.

Wait, maybe let me plug into the formula correctly. The formula is:

Sum_{k=1}^m cos(kθ) = [sin(mθ/2) / sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So here θ = π/n, and m = floor(n/2). Let&#x27;s take n even first: n = 2m. Then θ = π/(2m), and the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m)). Then applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(m*(π/(2m))/2) / sin(π/(4m))] * cos((m + 1)*(π/(2m))/2). Wait, no, that&#x27;s not correct. Let me be precise.

Wait, in the formula, θ is the common difference. So in our case, θ = π/n. For n even, m = n/2. So the sum is from k=1 to m of cos(kθ) where θ = π/n. Therefore, applying the formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

Substituting m = n/2, θ = π/n:

Sum = [sin((n/2)(π/n)/2) / sin((π/n)/2)] * cos(((n/2 + 1)(π/n))/2)

Simplify each part:

First, mθ/2 = (n/2)(π/n)/2 = (π/2)/2 = π/4

Denominator sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2n))

Second part: ((m + 1)θ)/2 = ((n/2 + 1)π/n)/2 = (π/2 + π/n)/2 = π/4 + π/(2n)

Therefore, Sum = [sin(π/4)/sin(π/(2n))] * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

So, sin(π/4) is √2/2, so:

Sum = (√2/2) / sin(π/(2n)) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))

Therefore, the original expression is (1/n) * Sum = (1/n) * [√2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) * cos(π/4 + π/(2n))]

Now, as n approaches infinity, π/(2n) approaches 0, so sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n). Therefore, sin(π/(2n)) ≈ π/(2n) - (π/(2n))^3/6 + ... So, 1/sin(π/(2n)) ≈ 2n/π (1 + (π^2)/(24n^2) + ... )

Therefore, √2/(2 sin(π/(2n))) ≈ √2/(2) * (2n/π) (1 + ...) = √2 n / π (1 + ...)

Then, cos(π/4 + π/(2n)) = cos(π/4)cos(π/(2n)) - sin(π/4)sin(π/(2n)) ≈ (√2/2)(1 - (π/(2n))^2/2) - (√2/2)(π/(2n)) ≈ √2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n) - higher order terms.

Multiplying these together:

[√2 n / π] * [√2/2 - √2/2 * π/(2n)] ≈ (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) - (√2 * √2 n / (π * 2)) * π/(2n) + ... = (2n / (2π)) - (2n / (2π)) * π/(2n) + ... = n/π - (1/2) + ...

Then, multiplying by (1/n):

(1/n) * [n/π - 1/2 + ...] = 1/π - 1/(2n) + ... 

So as n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/π. So that checks out for even n.

Now, let&#x27;s check when n is odd. Let n = 2m + 1. Then floor(n/2) = m. Then the sum is sum_{k=1}^m cos(kπ/(2m + 1)). Applying the same formula:

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2), where θ = π/(2m + 1)

So, substituting:

Sum = [sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) / sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ] * cos( (m + 1) * π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Simplify:

First term in numerator: sin(mπ/(2(2m + 1))) = sin( (2m^2 + m)π / (2(2m + 1)) )? Wait, no, wait: m * π / (2(2m + 1)) is just mπ/(2(2m + 1)).

Similarly, denominator: sin(π/(2(2m + 1)))

Second term: cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) )

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Let me see if as m becomes large (since n = 2m + 1 approaches infinity), we can approximate this.

Let me set m large, so n = 2m + 1 ≈ 2m. Then θ = π/(2m + 1) ≈ π/(2m). Let&#x27;s see:

Numerator: sin(mθ/2) = sin(m * π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ sin(m * π/(4m)) = sin(π/4) = √2/2.

Denominator: sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ π/(4m).

Similarly, the cosine term: cos( (m + 1)θ/2 ) = cos( (m + 1)π/(2(2m + 1)) ) ≈ cos( (m)π/(4m) ) = cos(π/4) = √2/2.

Therefore, Sum ≈ [√2/2 / (π/(4m))] * √2/2 = [ (√2/2) * (4m/π) ) ] * (√2/2 ) = ( (4m/π) * (√2/2) ) * (√2/2 ) = (4m/π) * (2/4) ) = (4m/π) * (1/2) ) = 2m/π.

Then, since n ≈ 2m, m ≈ n/2, so Sum ≈ 2*(n/2)/π = n/π. Therefore, (1/n)*Sum ≈ 1/π, same as before. Therefore, whether n is even or odd, as n becomes large, the sum divided by n tends to 1/π. Therefore, the limit is 1/π. 

Therefore, I think the answer is 1/π.

But just to be thorough, let me check with specific large n. Let&#x27;s take n = 1000 (even). Then floor(n/2) = 500. The sum is sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000). Then (1/1000)*sum ≈ integral from 0 to 1/2 of cos(πx) dx = 1/π ≈ 0.318. Let me compute the sum numerically. 

Alternatively, using the formula:

Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1000) = [sin(500*(π/1000)/2)/sin(π/(2000))] * cos((500 + 1)*(π/1000)/2)

Wait, using the formula again. Let me compute this. So m = 500, θ = π/1000.

Sum = [sin(mθ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * cos((m + 1)θ/2)

So mθ/2 = 500*(π/1000)/2 = π/4, same as before. sin(π/4) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071.

sin(θ/2) = sin(π/(2000)) ≈ π/2000 - (π/2000)^3/6. Let&#x27;s compute sin(π/2000): π ≈ 3.1416, so π/2000 ≈ 0.0015708. sin(0.0015708) ≈ 0.0015708 - (0.0015708)^3/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - (3.875e-9)/6 ≈ 0.0015708 - 6.458e-10 ≈ 0.0015708. So sin(π/2000) ≈ 0.0015708.

Then, [sin(π/4)/sin(π/2000)] ≈ (0.7071)/(0.0015708) ≈ 450. 

Then, cos((m + 1)θ/2) = cos(501*(π/1000)/2) = cos(501π/2000). 501π/2000 ≈ (500π + π)/2000 = π/4 + π/2000 ≈ 0.7854 + 0.0015708 ≈ 0.7870 radians. cos(0.7870) ≈ 0.7071 (since π/4 is 0.7854, cos(π/4) ≈ 0.7071). So cos(501π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - sin(π/4)*(π/2000) ≈ 0.7071 - 0.7071*0.0015708 ≈ 0.7071 - 0.001111 ≈ 0.7060.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7.

Then, (1/1000)*Sum ≈ 0.3177. And 1/π ≈ 0.3183, so that&#x27;s very close. So that checks out.

Similarly, for n = 1001 (odd), floor(n/2) = 500. Sum_{k=1}^{500} cos(kπ/1001). Let&#x27;s use the formula again.

θ = π/1001, m = 500.

Sum = [sin(500*(π/1001)/2)/sin(π/(2002))] * cos(501*(π/1001)/2)

Compute:

500*(π/1001)/2 ≈ (500/1001)*(π/2) ≈ 0.4995*(1.5708) ≈ 0.7841 radians.

sin(0.7841) ≈ sin(π/4 + a little) ≈ 0.7071 + something. Wait, 0.7841 radians is approximately 45 degrees + 0.7841 - 0.7854 ≈ 45 degrees - 0.0013 radians, so very close to π/4. So sin(0.7841) ≈ 0.7071.

Similarly, sin(π/(2002)) ≈ π/2002 ≈ 0.001570. 

Then, [sin(0.7841)/sin(0.001570)] ≈ 0.7071 / 0.001570 ≈ 450. 

Then, cos(501*(π/1001)/2) = cos(501π/2002). 501/2002 ≈ 0.25025. 0.25025*π ≈ 0.786 radians. So cos(0.786) ≈ 0.7060, similar to before.

Therefore, Sum ≈ 450 * 0.7060 ≈ 317.7. Then (1/1001)*317.7 ≈ 0.3175, again close to 1/π ≈ 0.3183. So that also checks out.

Therefore, both even and odd cases give results approaching 1/π. So I can be confident that the limit is indeed 1/π. 

Just to recap, the key idea was recognizing that the given sum is a Riemann sum approximating the integral of cos(πx) from 0 to 1/2, which evaluates to 1/π. Additionally, verifying with the summation formula for cosines and checking specific numerical cases supported this conclusion. Therefore, the final answer is 1/π.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{\pi}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \[ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\; \frac{1}{n}\;\sum_{k=1}^{\Big\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\Big\rfloor} \cos\Big(\frac{k\pi}{n}\Big), \] we recognize that as \( n \) approaches infinity, the upper limit \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \) can be approximated by \( \frac{n}{2} \). This allows us to consider the sum as a Riemann sum approximation of an integral.

The sum \( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) can be approximated by the integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \). This is because the terms \( \cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) \) with \( x_k = \frac{k}{n} \) approximate the function \( \cos(\pi x) \) over the interval \( [0, \frac{1}{2}] \) with spacing \( \frac{1}{n} \).

The integral of \( \cos(\pi x) \) from 0 to \( \frac{1}{2} \) is computed as follows:
\[
\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} \cos(\pi x) \, dx = \left[ \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi} \right]_0^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - \sin(0)}{\pi} = \frac{1 - 0}{\pi} = \frac{1}{\\pi}.
\]

Thus, the limit is evaluated to be \( \frac{1}{\pi} \).

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{\pi}}

Reference Answer: We recognize $8x^3-27$ as a difference of cubes. We can write $8x^3-27$ as $(2x)^3-3^3$. We know that $$a^3-b^3= (a-b)(a^{2}+ab+b^{2}). $$Thus, $$ (2x)^3-3^3=(2x-3)(4x^2+6x+9).$$Therefore, $a+b+c+d+e=2-3+4+6+9=\boxed{18}$.          </p>

Problem: Determine the number of real solutions for the system of equations:
\[ x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98, \]
\[ \lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05, \]
\[ -\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01. \] Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>

Response: \boxed{2}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to solve this system of equations with floor functions and fractional parts. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:

1. \( x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( \lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
3. \( -\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01 \)

Hmm, floor functions and fractional parts. Remember, for any real number \( a \), \( a = \lfloor a \rfloor + \{a\} \), where \( \lfloor a \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( a \), and \( \{a\} \) is the fractional part, so \( 0 \leq \{a\} &lt; 1 \).

Let me denote:

Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), so \( \{x\} = x - a \), where \( a \) is integer and \( 0 \leq \{x\} &lt; 1 \).

Similarly, \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \{y\} = y - b \), with \( b \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{y\} &lt; 1 \).

And \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), \( \{z\} = z - c \), \( c \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So substituting these into the equations:

1. \( x + b - (z - c) = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( x + b - z + c = 2.98 \)
   Since \( x = a + \{x\} \), and \( z = c + \{z\} \), substitute these:
   \( (a + \{x\}) + b - (c + \{z\}) + c = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{x\} + b - c - \{z\} + c = 2.98 \)
   So \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
   
2. \( a + (y - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Since \( y = b + \{y\} \), substitute:
   \( a + (b + \{y\} - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
   Again, \( z = c + \{z\} \), so:
   \( a + \{y\} - (c + \{z\}) = 4.05 \)
   Which becomes: \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)

3. \( -\{x\} + y + c = 5.01 \)
   Substitute \( y = b + \{y\} \):
   \( -\{x\} + b + \{y\} + c = 5.01 \)
   So: \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

So now, the transformed equations are:

1. \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

Additionally, we have the original variables:

- \( x = a + \{x\} \)
- \( y = b + \{y\} \)
- \( z = c + \{z\} \)

With \( a, b, c \) integers, and \( 0 \leq \{x\}, \{y\}, \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So maybe I can set variables for the fractional parts:

Let me denote:

- \( \{x\} = u \), so \( 0 \leq u &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{y\} = v \), so \( 0 \leq v &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{z\} = w \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 1 \)

So equations become:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

And variables:

- \( x = a + u \)
- \( y = b + v \)
- \( z = c + w \)

Now, the problem is to find integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \in [0,1) \) such that these equations hold.

So maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) are integers, and \( u, w \) are fractions between 0 and 1, the right-hand side (RHS) is 2.98 + (w - u). Since \( w - u \) can be between -1 and 1 (since both are less than 1), so the RHS is between 2.98 - 1 ≈ 1.98 and 2.98 + 1 ≈ 3.98. Therefore, \( a + b \) must be an integer in that interval, so possible values of \( a + b \) are 2 or 3.

Similarly, equation 3: \( b + c = 5.01 - v + u \). The RHS is 5.01 + (u - v). Since \( u - v \) is between -1 and 1, the RHS is between 4.01 and 6.01. Therefore, \( b + c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values are 5 or 6.

Equation 2: \( a - c = 4.05 - v + w \). RHS is 4.05 + (w - v). Since \( w - v \in (-1,1) \), the RHS is between 3.05 and 5.05. Therefore, \( a - c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values 4 or 5.

So let&#x27;s note the possible integer values:

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2 \) or \( 3 \)

From equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \)

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \)

So we need to find integers \( a, b, c \) such that these combinations hold. Let&#x27;s list possible cases.

Case 1: \( a + b = 2 \)

Then, equation 1 gives \( 2 + u - w = 2.98 \), so \( u - w = 0.98 \). Since \( u, w \in [0,1) \), \( u = w + 0.98 \). But since \( u &lt; 1 \), \( w + 0.98 &lt; 1 \implies w &lt; 0.02 \). Similarly, \( w = u - 0.98 \geq 0 - 0.98 = -0.98 \), but \( w \geq 0 \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 0.02 \).

So \( w \in [0, 0.02) \), and \( u = w + 0.98 \in [0.98, 1.0) \). But \( u must be less than 1, so that&#x27;s okay.

Case 1, equation 1: \( u = w + 0.98 \), \( w \in [0, 0.02) \)

Now, proceed to equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \). Let&#x27;s suppose:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then from equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v \in [0,1) \), so \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u = w + 0.98 \), and \( w &lt; 0.02 \implies u &lt; 0.98 + 0.02 = 1.0 \), so actually \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \). So for \( v = u + 0.01 \), we need \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Therefore, combining with \( u \geq 0.98 \), \( u \in [0.98, 0.99) \), which implies \( w = u - 0.98 \in [0, 0.01) \), and \( v \in [0.99, 1.0) \). But \( v must be less than 1, so okay.

Alternatively, if \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v \geq 0 \implies u - 0.99 \geq 0 \implies u \geq 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \), so \( u \geq 0.99 \implies u \in [0.99, 1.0) \). Then \( v = u - 0.99 \in [0, 0.01) \). But \( u \in [0.99, 1.0) \), so \( v \in [0, 0.01) \).

So in Case 1, equation 3 can split into two subcases: \( b + c = 5 \) leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \), or \( b + c = 6 \) leading to \( v = u - 0.99 \).

Let me hold onto that and check equation 2.

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \).

But since in Case 1, \( a + b = 2 \), and equation 3 has \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), we can express \( a - c \) in terms of \( (a + b) - (b + c) + 2c \). Wait, maybe it&#x27;s better to relate variables.

Given \( a + b = 2 \), and \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), then:

If \( a + b = 2 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtracting the first from the second: \( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 2 \implies c - a = 3 \implies c = a + 3 \)

Similarly, if \( b + c = 6 \), then \( c - a = 6 - 2 = 4 \implies c = a + 4 \)

So equation 2 is \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \). But from above:

If \( c = a + 3 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 3) = -3 \), which is not 4 or 5. So that&#x27;s impossible.

If \( c = a + 4 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 4) = -4 \), which is also not 4 or 5. So in Case 1, regardless of \( b + c = 5 \) or 6, \( a - c \) is -3 or -4, which doesn&#x27;t match the possible equation 2 values (4 or 5). Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.

Thus, there are no solutions when \( a + b = 2 \).

Proceeding to Case 2: \( a + b = 3 \)

Then equation 1: \( 3 + u - w = 2.98 \implies u - w = -0.02 \implies u = w - 0.02 \)

But \( u \geq 0 \implies w - 0.02 \geq 0 \implies w \geq 0.02 \). Also, \( w &lt; 1 \implies u = w - 0.02 &lt; 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 \). So \( u \in [0, 0.98) \), and \( w = u + 0.02 \in [0.02, 1.0) \)

So equation 1 gives \( w = u + 0.02 \), \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), \( w ∈ [0.02, 1.0) \)

Now, equation 3: \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

Again, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6 (since the RHS is 5.01 + (u - v) which is between 4.01 and 6.01, as before). So similar to before:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v &lt; 1 \implies u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Which is already true because \( u &lt; 0.98 \). So \( v = u + 0.01 \), with \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), so \( v ∈ [0.01, 0.99) \)

If \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v ≥ 0 \implies u - 0.99 ≥ 0 \implies u ≥ 0.99 \). However, from equation 1, \( u &lt; 0.98 \), which conflicts. So this is impossible. Therefore, in Case 2, equation 3 must have \( b + c = 5 \), leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \)

So now, in Case 2, equations so far:

1. \( a + b = 3 \)
2. \( u = w - 0.02 \)
3. \( v = u + 0.01 = w - 0.02 + 0.01 = w - 0.01 \)
4. \( b + c = 5 \)
5. From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We can express \( a - c \). Since \( a + b = 3 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtract the first from the second:

\( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 3 \implies c - a = 2 \implies c = a + 2 \)

So substituting into equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

But \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - (a + 2) + v - w = -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so substituting:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = 6.05 \implies -0.01 = 6.05 \implies \)

This is impossible. Contradiction. So in Case 2, even with \( b + c =5 \), we end up with a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is impossible?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We have \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - c = -2 \)

Therefore, equation 2 becomes: \( -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = -0.01 = 6.05 \)

Which is not possible. Hence, contradiction. So even though we thought maybe Case 2 could work, the equations lead to a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is also impossible?

Wait, but both cases lead to contradictions. That can&#x27;t be. Then there are no solutions? But the problem states &quot;determine the number of real solutions&quot;, so maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple possibilities for \( a, b, c \). Wait, in Case 2, we have \( a + b = 3 \), \( b + c =5 \), so \( c = a + 2 \). Then in equation 2, substituting \( a - c = -2 \), and \( v - w \), but \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). Then equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = 4.05 \implies -2.01 =4.05 \), which is false. So that&#x27;s impossible.

But maybe I made a wrong assumption when I split the equations. Let me check again.

Wait, equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \). From Case 2:

We have \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). And \( a - c = -2 \). Therefore, equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = -2.01 \), which is not equal to 4.05. So indeed, no solution here.

Hmm. So both cases when \( a + b = 2 \) and \( 3 \) lead to contradictions. Therefore, does that mean there are no solutions? But the problem is from a competition, so it&#x27;s unlikely to have no solutions. Maybe I made a wrong approach.

Wait, let me check again the equations after substitution.

Original equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Variables:

- \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z} \)
- \( u, v, w ∈ [0,1) \)

Perhaps I need to solve these three equations for integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \).

Let me try to write these equations as linear equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to combine the equations to eliminate some variables.

First, add equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w = 7.99 \)

But equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Let me subtract equation 2 from the sum:

Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99 \)
Minus equation 2: \( (a - c + v - w) =4.05 \)
Result: \( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)
Simplify: \( 2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c =1.97 \)

But \( b + c \) must be integer since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. But 1.97 is not an integer. Contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that the system is inconsistent? But that can&#x27;t be. Wait, so even if we assume that the equations hold, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 leads to a non-integer sum, which contradicts that \( b + c \) must be integer. Therefore, there are no solutions?

But this is strange. Let me verify my steps again.

Adding equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =2.98 +5.01 =7.99 \)

Equation 2: \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Subtracting equation 2 from the sum:

\( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 2b + 2c =3.94 \implies b +c =1.97 \)

But since \( b, c \) are integers, \( b +c \) must be integer, but 1.97 is not. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, the system has no solution.

Therefore, the number of real solutions is zero.

But wait, this seems to be the case. But let me check if I added the equations correctly.

Equation 1: a + b + u - w =2.98

Equation 3: b + c + v - u =5.01

Sum: a + b + u - w + b + c + v - u =2.98 +5.01

Simplifies to: a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99

Equation 2: a - c + v - w =4.05

Subtract equation 2: (a +2b + c + v -w) - (a -c +v -w) =7.99 -4.05

Left side: a +2b +c +v -w -a +c -v +w =2b +2c

Right side:3.94

Thus, 2b +2c=3.94 =&gt; b +c=1.97, which is impossible because b and c are integers. Therefore, the system is inconsistent, no solutions.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check again for possible miscalculations.

Wait, the problem says &quot;real solutions&quot;, but in the equations, floor and fractional parts are involved, so variables x, y, z are real numbers, but with their floor and fractional parts.

But according to the above, the equations lead to a contradiction, so there&#x27;s no solution.

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the thought process. Let me check with different approaches.

Suppose I take equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w =2.98 \)

2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to express variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b =2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) integers, 2.98 -u +w must be integer. Since u, w are fractional parts, 0 ≤ u, w &lt;1, so 2.98 - u + w ∈ (2.98 -1 +0, 2.98 -0 +1) = (1.98, 3.98). Thus, possible integer values 2 or3.

Similarly, from equation3: \( b +c =5.01 -v +u \). 5.01 -v +u ∈ (5.01 -1 +0, 5.01 -0 +1)= (4.01,6.01). So integers 5 or6.

From equation2: \( a -c =4.05 -v +w \). 4.05 -v +w ∈ (4.05 -1 +0,4.05 -0 +1)= (3.05,5.05). So integers4 or5.

So possible combinations:

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

So total 8 cases. Let&#x27;s check each.

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4, subtract the equations: (a -c) - (a +b)=4 -2 =&gt; -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But from b +c=5, contradiction. So invalid.

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=2 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; -(c + b)=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Similarly, a -c=5 and a +b=2. Subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

All cases lead to contradictions. Hence, there are no solutions. Therefore, the system of equations has no real solutions. Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98, \\
\lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05, \\
-\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01,
\end{cases}
\]
we start by expressing each variable in terms of its integer and fractional parts. Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), and \( \{x\} = u \), \( \{y\} = v \), \( \{z\} = w \), where \( a, b, c \) are integers and \( u, v, w \) are fractional parts such that \( 0 \leq u, v, w &lt; 1 \).

Substituting these into the equations, we get:
1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

We analyze the possible integer values for \( a + b \), \( b + c \), and \( a - c \):
- From equation 1, \( a + b \) must be 2 or 3.
- From equation 3, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6.
- From equation 2, \( a - c \) must be 4 or 5.

We check all possible combinations of these integer values and find that each leads to a contradiction. For example, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 results in:
\[
2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c = 1.97
\]
which is impossible since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. Similarly, other combinations also lead to contradictions.

Thus, the system of equations is inconsistent and has no real solutions. The number of real solutions is:
\[
\boxed{0}

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to solve this system of equations with floor functions and fractional parts. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:

1. \( x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( \lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
3. \( -\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01 \)

Hmm, floor functions and fractional parts. Remember, for any real number \( a \), \( a = \lfloor a \rfloor + \{a\} \), where \( \lfloor a \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( a \), and \( \{a\} \) is the fractional part, so \( 0 \leq \{a\} &lt; 1 \).

Let me denote:

Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), so \( \{x\} = x - a \), where \( a \) is integer and \( 0 \leq \{x\} &lt; 1 \).

Similarly, \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \{y\} = y - b \), with \( b \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{y\} &lt; 1 \).

And \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), \( \{z\} = z - c \), \( c \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So substituting these into the equations:

1. \( x + b - (z - c) = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( x + b - z + c = 2.98 \)
   Since \( x = a + \{x\} \), and \( z = c + \{z\} \), substitute these:
   \( (a + \{x\}) + b - (c + \{z\}) + c = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{x\} + b - c - \{z\} + c = 2.98 \)
   So \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
   
2. \( a + (y - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Since \( y = b + \{y\} \), substitute:
   \( a + (b + \{y\} - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
   Again, \( z = c + \{z\} \), so:
   \( a + \{y\} - (c + \{z\}) = 4.05 \)
   Which becomes: \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)

3. \( -\{x\} + y + c = 5.01 \)
   Substitute \( y = b + \{y\} \):
   \( -\{x\} + b + \{y\} + c = 5.01 \)
   So: \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

So now, the transformed equations are:

1. \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

Additionally, we have the original variables:

- \( x = a + \{x\} \)
- \( y = b + \{y\} \)
- \( z = c + \{z\} \)

With \( a, b, c \) integers, and \( 0 \leq \{x\}, \{y\}, \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So maybe I can set variables for the fractional parts:

Let me denote:

- \( \{x\} = u \), so \( 0 \leq u &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{y\} = v \), so \( 0 \leq v &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{z\} = w \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 1 \)

So equations become:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

And variables:

- \( x = a + u \)
- \( y = b + v \)
- \( z = c + w \)

Now, the problem is to find integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \in [0,1) \) such that these equations hold.

So maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) are integers, and \( u, w \) are fractions between 0 and 1, the right-hand side (RHS) is 2.98 + (w - u). Since \( w - u \) can be between -1 and 1 (since both are less than 1), so the RHS is between 2.98 - 1 ≈ 1.98 and 2.98 + 1 ≈ 3.98. Therefore, \( a + b \) must be an integer in that interval, so possible values of \( a + b \) are 2 or 3.

Similarly, equation 3: \( b + c = 5.01 - v + u \). The RHS is 5.01 + (u - v). Since \( u - v \) is between -1 and 1, the RHS is between 4.01 and 6.01. Therefore, \( b + c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values are 5 or 6.

Equation 2: \( a - c = 4.05 - v + w \). RHS is 4.05 + (w - v). Since \( w - v \in (-1,1) \), the RHS is between 3.05 and 5.05. Therefore, \( a - c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values 4 or 5.

So let&#x27;s note the possible integer values:

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2 \) or \( 3 \)

From equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \)

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \)

So we need to find integers \( a, b, c \) such that these combinations hold. Let&#x27;s list possible cases.

Case 1: \( a + b = 2 \)

Then, equation 1 gives \( 2 + u - w = 2.98 \), so \( u - w = 0.98 \). Since \( u, w \in [0,1) \), \( u = w + 0.98 \). But since \( u &lt; 1 \), \( w + 0.98 &lt; 1 \implies w &lt; 0.02 \). Similarly, \( w = u - 0.98 \geq 0 - 0.98 = -0.98 \), but \( w \geq 0 \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 0.02 \).

So \( w \in [0, 0.02) \), and \( u = w + 0.98 \in [0.98, 1.0) \). But \( u must be less than 1, so that&#x27;s okay.

Case 1, equation 1: \( u = w + 0.98 \), \( w \in [0, 0.02) \)

Now, proceed to equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \). Let&#x27;s suppose:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then from equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v \in [0,1) \), so \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u = w + 0.98 \), and \( w &lt; 0.02 \implies u &lt; 0.98 + 0.02 = 1.0 \), so actually \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \). So for \( v = u + 0.01 \), we need \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Therefore, combining with \( u \geq 0.98 \), \( u \in [0.98, 0.99) \), which implies \( w = u - 0.98 \in [0, 0.01) \), and \( v \in [0.99, 1.0) \). But \( v must be less than 1, so okay.

Alternatively, if \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v \geq 0 \implies u - 0.99 \geq 0 \implies u \geq 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \), so \( u \geq 0.99 \implies u \in [0.99, 1.0) \). Then \( v = u - 0.99 \in [0, 0.01) \). But \( u \in [0.99, 1.0) \), so \( v \in [0, 0.01) \).

So in Case 1, equation 3 can split into two subcases: \( b + c = 5 \) leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \), or \( b + c = 6 \) leading to \( v = u - 0.99 \).

Let me hold onto that and check equation 2.

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \).

But since in Case 1, \( a + b = 2 \), and equation 3 has \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), we can express \( a - c \) in terms of \( (a + b) - (b + c) + 2c \). Wait, maybe it&#x27;s better to relate variables.

Given \( a + b = 2 \), and \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), then:

If \( a + b = 2 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtracting the first from the second: \( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 2 \implies c - a = 3 \implies c = a + 3 \)

Similarly, if \( b + c = 6 \), then \( c - a = 6 - 2 = 4 \implies c = a + 4 \)

So equation 2 is \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \). But from above:

If \( c = a + 3 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 3) = -3 \), which is not 4 or 5. So that&#x27;s impossible.

If \( c = a + 4 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 4) = -4 \), which is also not 4 or 5. So in Case 1, regardless of \( b + c = 5 \) or 6, \( a - c \) is -3 or -4, which doesn&#x27;t match the possible equation 2 values (4 or 5). Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.

Thus, there are no solutions when \( a + b = 2 \).

Proceeding to Case 2: \( a + b = 3 \)

Then equation 1: \( 3 + u - w = 2.98 \implies u - w = -0.02 \implies u = w - 0.02 \)

But \( u \geq 0 \implies w - 0.02 \geq 0 \implies w \geq 0.02 \). Also, \( w &lt; 1 \implies u = w - 0.02 &lt; 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 \). So \( u \in [0, 0.98) \), and \( w = u + 0.02 \in [0.02, 1.0) \)

So equation 1 gives \( w = u + 0.02 \), \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), \( w ∈ [0.02, 1.0) \)

Now, equation 3: \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

Again, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6 (since the RHS is 5.01 + (u - v) which is between 4.01 and 6.01, as before). So similar to before:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v &lt; 1 \implies u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Which is already true because \( u &lt; 0.98 \). So \( v = u + 0.01 \), with \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), so \( v ∈ [0.01, 0.99) \)

If \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v ≥ 0 \implies u - 0.99 ≥ 0 \implies u ≥ 0.99 \). However, from equation 1, \( u &lt; 0.98 \), which conflicts. So this is impossible. Therefore, in Case 2, equation 3 must have \( b + c = 5 \), leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \)

So now, in Case 2, equations so far:

1. \( a + b = 3 \)
2. \( u = w - 0.02 \)
3. \( v = u + 0.01 = w - 0.02 + 0.01 = w - 0.01 \)
4. \( b + c = 5 \)
5. From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We can express \( a - c \). Since \( a + b = 3 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtract the first from the second:

\( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 3 \implies c - a = 2 \implies c = a + 2 \)

So substituting into equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

But \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - (a + 2) + v - w = -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so substituting:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = 6.05 \implies -0.01 = 6.05 \implies \)

This is impossible. Contradiction. So in Case 2, even with \( b + c =5 \), we end up with a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is impossible?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We have \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - c = -2 \)

Therefore, equation 2 becomes: \( -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = -0.01 = 6.05 \)

Which is not possible. Hence, contradiction. So even though we thought maybe Case 2 could work, the equations lead to a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is also impossible?

Wait, but both cases lead to contradictions. That can&#x27;t be. Then there are no solutions? But the problem states &quot;determine the number of real solutions&quot;, so maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple possibilities for \( a, b, c \). Wait, in Case 2, we have \( a + b = 3 \), \( b + c =5 \), so \( c = a + 2 \). Then in equation 2, substituting \( a - c = -2 \), and \( v - w \), but \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). Then equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = 4.05 \implies -2.01 =4.05 \), which is false. So that&#x27;s impossible.

But maybe I made a wrong assumption when I split the equations. Let me check again.

Wait, equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \). From Case 2:

We have \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). And \( a - c = -2 \). Therefore, equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = -2.01 \), which is not equal to 4.05. So indeed, no solution here.

Hmm. So both cases when \( a + b = 2 \) and \( 3 \) lead to contradictions. Therefore, does that mean there are no solutions? But the problem is from a competition, so it&#x27;s unlikely to have no solutions. Maybe I made a wrong approach.

Wait, let me check again the equations after substitution.

Original equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Variables:

- \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z} \)
- \( u, v, w ∈ [0,1) \)

Perhaps I need to solve these three equations for integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \).

Let me try to write these equations as linear equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to combine the equations to eliminate some variables.

First, add equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w = 7.99 \)

But equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Let me subtract equation 2 from the sum:

Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99 \)
Minus equation 2: \( (a - c + v - w) =4.05 \)
Result: \( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)
Simplify: \( 2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c =1.97 \)

But \( b + c \) must be integer since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. But 1.97 is not an integer. Contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that the system is inconsistent? But that can&#x27;t be. Wait, so even if we assume that the equations hold, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 leads to a non-integer sum, which contradicts that \( b + c \) must be integer. Therefore, there are no solutions?

But this is strange. Let me verify my steps again.

Adding equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =2.98 +5.01 =7.99 \)

Equation 2: \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Subtracting equation 2 from the sum:

\( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 2b + 2c =3.94 \implies b +c =1.97 \)

But since \( b, c \) are integers, \( b +c \) must be integer, but 1.97 is not. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, the system has no solution.

Therefore, the number of real solutions is zero.

But wait, this seems to be the case. But let me check if I added the equations correctly.

Equation 1: a + b + u - w =2.98

Equation 3: b + c + v - u =5.01

Sum: a + b + u - w + b + c + v - u =2.98 +5.01

Simplifies to: a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99

Equation 2: a - c + v - w =4.05

Subtract equation 2: (a +2b + c + v -w) - (a -c +v -w) =7.99 -4.05

Left side: a +2b +c +v -w -a +c -v +w =2b +2c

Right side:3.94

Thus, 2b +2c=3.94 =&gt; b +c=1.97, which is impossible because b and c are integers. Therefore, the system is inconsistent, no solutions.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check again for possible miscalculations.

Wait, the problem says &quot;real solutions&quot;, but in the equations, floor and fractional parts are involved, so variables x, y, z are real numbers, but with their floor and fractional parts.

But according to the above, the equations lead to a contradiction, so there&#x27;s no solution.

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the thought process. Let me check with different approaches.

Suppose I take equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w =2.98 \)

2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to express variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b =2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) integers, 2.98 -u +w must be integer. Since u, w are fractional parts, 0 ≤ u, w &lt;1, so 2.98 - u + w ∈ (2.98 -1 +0, 2.98 -0 +1) = (1.98, 3.98). Thus, possible integer values 2 or3.

Similarly, from equation3: \( b +c =5.01 -v +u \). 5.01 -v +u ∈ (5.01 -1 +0, 5.01 -0 +1)= (4.01,6.01). So integers 5 or6.

From equation2: \( a -c =4.05 -v +w \). 4.05 -v +w ∈ (4.05 -1 +0,4.05 -0 +1)= (3.05,5.05). So integers4 or5.

So possible combinations:

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

So total 8 cases. Let&#x27;s check each.

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4, subtract the equations: (a -c) - (a +b)=4 -2 =&gt; -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But from b +c=5, contradiction. So invalid.

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=2 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; -(c + b)=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Similarly, a -c=5 and a +b=2. Subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

All cases lead to contradictions. Hence, there are no solutions. Therefore, the system of equations has no real solutions. Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98, \\
\lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05, \\
-\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01,
\end{cases}
\]
we start by expressing each variable in terms of its integer and fractional parts. Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), and \( \{x\} = u \), \( \{y\} = v \), \( \{z\} = w \), where \( a, b, c \) are integers and \( u, v, w \) are fractional parts such that \( 0 \leq u, v, w &lt; 1 \).

Substituting these into the equations, we get:
1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

We analyze the possible integer values for \( a + b \), \( b + c \), and \( a - c \):
- From equation 1, \( a + b \) must be 2 or 3.
- From equation 3, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6.
- From equation 2, \( a - c \) must be 4 or 5.

We check all possible combinations of these integer values and find that each leads to a contradiction. For example, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 results in:
\[
2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c = 1.97
\]
which is impossible since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. Similarly, other combinations also lead to contradictions.

Thus, the system of equations is inconsistent and has no real solutions. The number of real solutions is:
\[
\boxed{0}

Response: \boxed{2}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to solve this system of equations with floor functions and fractional parts. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:

1. \( x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( \lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
3. \( -\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01 \)

Hmm, floor functions and fractional parts. Remember, for any real number \( a \), \( a = \lfloor a \rfloor + \{a\} \), where \( \lfloor a \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( a \), and \( \{a\} \) is the fractional part, so \( 0 \leq \{a\} &lt; 1 \).

Let me denote:

Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), so \( \{x\} = x - a \), where \( a \) is integer and \( 0 \leq \{x\} &lt; 1 \).

Similarly, \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \{y\} = y - b \), with \( b \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{y\} &lt; 1 \).

And \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), \( \{z\} = z - c \), \( c \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So substituting these into the equations:

1. \( x + b - (z - c) = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( x + b - z + c = 2.98 \)
   Since \( x = a + \{x\} \), and \( z = c + \{z\} \), substitute these:
   \( (a + \{x\}) + b - (c + \{z\}) + c = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{x\} + b - c - \{z\} + c = 2.98 \)
   So \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
   
2. \( a + (y - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Since \( y = b + \{y\} \), substitute:
   \( a + (b + \{y\} - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
   Again, \( z = c + \{z\} \), so:
   \( a + \{y\} - (c + \{z\}) = 4.05 \)
   Which becomes: \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)

3. \( -\{x\} + y + c = 5.01 \)
   Substitute \( y = b + \{y\} \):
   \( -\{x\} + b + \{y\} + c = 5.01 \)
   So: \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

So now, the transformed equations are:

1. \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

Additionally, we have the original variables:

- \( x = a + \{x\} \)
- \( y = b + \{y\} \)
- \( z = c + \{z\} \)

With \( a, b, c \) integers, and \( 0 \leq \{x\}, \{y\}, \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So maybe I can set variables for the fractional parts:

Let me denote:

- \( \{x\} = u \), so \( 0 \leq u &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{y\} = v \), so \( 0 \leq v &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{z\} = w \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 1 \)

So equations become:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

And variables:

- \( x = a + u \)
- \( y = b + v \)
- \( z = c + w \)

Now, the problem is to find integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \in [0,1) \) such that these equations hold.

So maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) are integers, and \( u, w \) are fractions between 0 and 1, the right-hand side (RHS) is 2.98 + (w - u). Since \( w - u \) can be between -1 and 1 (since both are less than 1), so the RHS is between 2.98 - 1 ≈ 1.98 and 2.98 + 1 ≈ 3.98. Therefore, \( a + b \) must be an integer in that interval, so possible values of \( a + b \) are 2 or 3.

Similarly, equation 3: \( b + c = 5.01 - v + u \). The RHS is 5.01 + (u - v). Since \( u - v \) is between -1 and 1, the RHS is between 4.01 and 6.01. Therefore, \( b + c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values are 5 or 6.

Equation 2: \( a - c = 4.05 - v + w \). RHS is 4.05 + (w - v). Since \( w - v \in (-1,1) \), the RHS is between 3.05 and 5.05. Therefore, \( a - c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values 4 or 5.

So let&#x27;s note the possible integer values:

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2 \) or \( 3 \)

From equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \)

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \)

So we need to find integers \( a, b, c \) such that these combinations hold. Let&#x27;s list possible cases.

Case 1: \( a + b = 2 \)

Then, equation 1 gives \( 2 + u - w = 2.98 \), so \( u - w = 0.98 \). Since \( u, w \in [0,1) \), \( u = w + 0.98 \). But since \( u &lt; 1 \), \( w + 0.98 &lt; 1 \implies w &lt; 0.02 \). Similarly, \( w = u - 0.98 \geq 0 - 0.98 = -0.98 \), but \( w \geq 0 \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 0.02 \).

So \( w \in [0, 0.02) \), and \( u = w + 0.98 \in [0.98, 1.0) \). But \( u must be less than 1, so that&#x27;s okay.

Case 1, equation 1: \( u = w + 0.98 \), \( w \in [0, 0.02) \)

Now, proceed to equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \). Let&#x27;s suppose:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then from equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v \in [0,1) \), so \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u = w + 0.98 \), and \( w &lt; 0.02 \implies u &lt; 0.98 + 0.02 = 1.0 \), so actually \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \). So for \( v = u + 0.01 \), we need \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Therefore, combining with \( u \geq 0.98 \), \( u \in [0.98, 0.99) \), which implies \( w = u - 0.98 \in [0, 0.01) \), and \( v \in [0.99, 1.0) \). But \( v must be less than 1, so okay.

Alternatively, if \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v \geq 0 \implies u - 0.99 \geq 0 \implies u \geq 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \), so \( u \geq 0.99 \implies u \in [0.99, 1.0) \). Then \( v = u - 0.99 \in [0, 0.01) \). But \( u \in [0.99, 1.0) \), so \( v \in [0, 0.01) \).

So in Case 1, equation 3 can split into two subcases: \( b + c = 5 \) leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \), or \( b + c = 6 \) leading to \( v = u - 0.99 \).

Let me hold onto that and check equation 2.

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \).

But since in Case 1, \( a + b = 2 \), and equation 3 has \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), we can express \( a - c \) in terms of \( (a + b) - (b + c) + 2c \). Wait, maybe it&#x27;s better to relate variables.

Given \( a + b = 2 \), and \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), then:

If \( a + b = 2 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtracting the first from the second: \( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 2 \implies c - a = 3 \implies c = a + 3 \)

Similarly, if \( b + c = 6 \), then \( c - a = 6 - 2 = 4 \implies c = a + 4 \)

So equation 2 is \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \). But from above:

If \( c = a + 3 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 3) = -3 \), which is not 4 or 5. So that&#x27;s impossible.

If \( c = a + 4 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 4) = -4 \), which is also not 4 or 5. So in Case 1, regardless of \( b + c = 5 \) or 6, \( a - c \) is -3 or -4, which doesn&#x27;t match the possible equation 2 values (4 or 5). Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.

Thus, there are no solutions when \( a + b = 2 \).

Proceeding to Case 2: \( a + b = 3 \)

Then equation 1: \( 3 + u - w = 2.98 \implies u - w = -0.02 \implies u = w - 0.02 \)

But \( u \geq 0 \implies w - 0.02 \geq 0 \implies w \geq 0.02 \). Also, \( w &lt; 1 \implies u = w - 0.02 &lt; 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 \). So \( u \in [0, 0.98) \), and \( w = u + 0.02 \in [0.02, 1.0) \)

So equation 1 gives \( w = u + 0.02 \), \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), \( w ∈ [0.02, 1.0) \)

Now, equation 3: \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

Again, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6 (since the RHS is 5.01 + (u - v) which is between 4.01 and 6.01, as before). So similar to before:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v &lt; 1 \implies u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Which is already true because \( u &lt; 0.98 \). So \( v = u + 0.01 \), with \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), so \( v ∈ [0.01, 0.99) \)

If \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v ≥ 0 \implies u - 0.99 ≥ 0 \implies u ≥ 0.99 \). However, from equation 1, \( u &lt; 0.98 \), which conflicts. So this is impossible. Therefore, in Case 2, equation 3 must have \( b + c = 5 \), leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \)

So now, in Case 2, equations so far:

1. \( a + b = 3 \)
2. \( u = w - 0.02 \)
3. \( v = u + 0.01 = w - 0.02 + 0.01 = w - 0.01 \)
4. \( b + c = 5 \)
5. From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We can express \( a - c \). Since \( a + b = 3 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtract the first from the second:

\( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 3 \implies c - a = 2 \implies c = a + 2 \)

So substituting into equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

But \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - (a + 2) + v - w = -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so substituting:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = 6.05 \implies -0.01 = 6.05 \implies \)

This is impossible. Contradiction. So in Case 2, even with \( b + c =5 \), we end up with a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is impossible?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We have \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - c = -2 \)

Therefore, equation 2 becomes: \( -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = -0.01 = 6.05 \)

Which is not possible. Hence, contradiction. So even though we thought maybe Case 2 could work, the equations lead to a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is also impossible?

Wait, but both cases lead to contradictions. That can&#x27;t be. Then there are no solutions? But the problem states &quot;determine the number of real solutions&quot;, so maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple possibilities for \( a, b, c \). Wait, in Case 2, we have \( a + b = 3 \), \( b + c =5 \), so \( c = a + 2 \). Then in equation 2, substituting \( a - c = -2 \), and \( v - w \), but \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). Then equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = 4.05 \implies -2.01 =4.05 \), which is false. So that&#x27;s impossible.

But maybe I made a wrong assumption when I split the equations. Let me check again.

Wait, equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \). From Case 2:

We have \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). And \( a - c = -2 \). Therefore, equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = -2.01 \), which is not equal to 4.05. So indeed, no solution here.

Hmm. So both cases when \( a + b = 2 \) and \( 3 \) lead to contradictions. Therefore, does that mean there are no solutions? But the problem is from a competition, so it&#x27;s unlikely to have no solutions. Maybe I made a wrong approach.

Wait, let me check again the equations after substitution.

Original equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Variables:

- \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z} \)
- \( u, v, w ∈ [0,1) \)

Perhaps I need to solve these three equations for integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \).

Let me try to write these equations as linear equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to combine the equations to eliminate some variables.

First, add equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w = 7.99 \)

But equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Let me subtract equation 2 from the sum:

Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99 \)
Minus equation 2: \( (a - c + v - w) =4.05 \)
Result: \( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)
Simplify: \( 2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c =1.97 \)

But \( b + c \) must be integer since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. But 1.97 is not an integer. Contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that the system is inconsistent? But that can&#x27;t be. Wait, so even if we assume that the equations hold, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 leads to a non-integer sum, which contradicts that \( b + c \) must be integer. Therefore, there are no solutions?

But this is strange. Let me verify my steps again.

Adding equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =2.98 +5.01 =7.99 \)

Equation 2: \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Subtracting equation 2 from the sum:

\( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 2b + 2c =3.94 \implies b +c =1.97 \)

But since \( b, c \) are integers, \( b +c \) must be integer, but 1.97 is not. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, the system has no solution.

Therefore, the number of real solutions is zero.

But wait, this seems to be the case. But let me check if I added the equations correctly.

Equation 1: a + b + u - w =2.98

Equation 3: b + c + v - u =5.01

Sum: a + b + u - w + b + c + v - u =2.98 +5.01

Simplifies to: a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99

Equation 2: a - c + v - w =4.05

Subtract equation 2: (a +2b + c + v -w) - (a -c +v -w) =7.99 -4.05

Left side: a +2b +c +v -w -a +c -v +w =2b +2c

Right side:3.94

Thus, 2b +2c=3.94 =&gt; b +c=1.97, which is impossible because b and c are integers. Therefore, the system is inconsistent, no solutions.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check again for possible miscalculations.

Wait, the problem says &quot;real solutions&quot;, but in the equations, floor and fractional parts are involved, so variables x, y, z are real numbers, but with their floor and fractional parts.

But according to the above, the equations lead to a contradiction, so there&#x27;s no solution.

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the thought process. Let me check with different approaches.

Suppose I take equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w =2.98 \)

2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to express variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b =2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) integers, 2.98 -u +w must be integer. Since u, w are fractional parts, 0 ≤ u, w &lt;1, so 2.98 - u + w ∈ (2.98 -1 +0, 2.98 -0 +1) = (1.98, 3.98). Thus, possible integer values 2 or3.

Similarly, from equation3: \( b +c =5.01 -v +u \). 5.01 -v +u ∈ (5.01 -1 +0, 5.01 -0 +1)= (4.01,6.01). So integers 5 or6.

From equation2: \( a -c =4.05 -v +w \). 4.05 -v +w ∈ (4.05 -1 +0,4.05 -0 +1)= (3.05,5.05). So integers4 or5.

So possible combinations:

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

So total 8 cases. Let&#x27;s check each.

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4, subtract the equations: (a -c) - (a +b)=4 -2 =&gt; -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But from b +c=5, contradiction. So invalid.

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=2 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; -(c + b)=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Similarly, a -c=5 and a +b=2. Subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

All cases lead to contradictions. Hence, there are no solutions. Therefore, the system of equations has no real solutions. Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98, \\
\lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05, \\
-\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01,
\end{cases}
\]
we start by expressing each variable in terms of its integer and fractional parts. Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), and \( \{x\} = u \), \( \{y\} = v \), \( \{z\} = w \), where \( a, b, c \) are integers and \( u, v, w \) are fractional parts such that \( 0 \leq u, v, w &lt; 1 \).

Substituting these into the equations, we get:
1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

We analyze the possible integer values for \( a + b \), \( b + c \), and \( a - c \):
- From equation 1, \( a + b \) must be 2 or 3.
- From equation 3, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6.
- From equation 2, \( a - c \) must be 4 or 5.

We check all possible combinations of these integer values and find that each leads to a contradiction. For example, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 results in:
\[
2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c = 1.97
\]
which is impossible since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. Similarly, other combinations also lead to contradictions.

Thus, the system of equations is inconsistent and has no real solutions. The number of real solutions is:
\[
\boxed{0}

Response: \boxed{2}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to solve this system of equations with floor functions and fractional parts. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:

1. \( x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( \lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
3. \( -\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01 \)

Hmm, floor functions and fractional parts. Remember, for any real number \( a \), \( a = \lfloor a \rfloor + \{a\} \), where \( \lfloor a \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( a \), and \( \{a\} \) is the fractional part, so \( 0 \leq \{a\} &lt; 1 \).

Let me denote:

Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), so \( \{x\} = x - a \), where \( a \) is integer and \( 0 \leq \{x\} &lt; 1 \).

Similarly, \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \{y\} = y - b \), with \( b \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{y\} &lt; 1 \).

And \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), \( \{z\} = z - c \), \( c \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So substituting these into the equations:

1. \( x + b - (z - c) = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( x + b - z + c = 2.98 \)
   Since \( x = a + \{x\} \), and \( z = c + \{z\} \), substitute these:
   \( (a + \{x\}) + b - (c + \{z\}) + c = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{x\} + b - c - \{z\} + c = 2.98 \)
   So \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
   
2. \( a + (y - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Since \( y = b + \{y\} \), substitute:
   \( a + (b + \{y\} - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
   Again, \( z = c + \{z\} \), so:
   \( a + \{y\} - (c + \{z\}) = 4.05 \)
   Which becomes: \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)

3. \( -\{x\} + y + c = 5.01 \)
   Substitute \( y = b + \{y\} \):
   \( -\{x\} + b + \{y\} + c = 5.01 \)
   So: \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

So now, the transformed equations are:

1. \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

Additionally, we have the original variables:

- \( x = a + \{x\} \)
- \( y = b + \{y\} \)
- \( z = c + \{z\} \)

With \( a, b, c \) integers, and \( 0 \leq \{x\}, \{y\}, \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So maybe I can set variables for the fractional parts:

Let me denote:

- \( \{x\} = u \), so \( 0 \leq u &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{y\} = v \), so \( 0 \leq v &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{z\} = w \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 1 \)

So equations become:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

And variables:

- \( x = a + u \)
- \( y = b + v \)
- \( z = c + w \)

Now, the problem is to find integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \in [0,1) \) such that these equations hold.

So maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) are integers, and \( u, w \) are fractions between 0 and 1, the right-hand side (RHS) is 2.98 + (w - u). Since \( w - u \) can be between -1 and 1 (since both are less than 1), so the RHS is between 2.98 - 1 ≈ 1.98 and 2.98 + 1 ≈ 3.98. Therefore, \( a + b \) must be an integer in that interval, so possible values of \( a + b \) are 2 or 3.

Similarly, equation 3: \( b + c = 5.01 - v + u \). The RHS is 5.01 + (u - v). Since \( u - v \) is between -1 and 1, the RHS is between 4.01 and 6.01. Therefore, \( b + c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values are 5 or 6.

Equation 2: \( a - c = 4.05 - v + w \). RHS is 4.05 + (w - v). Since \( w - v \in (-1,1) \), the RHS is between 3.05 and 5.05. Therefore, \( a - c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values 4 or 5.

So let&#x27;s note the possible integer values:

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2 \) or \( 3 \)

From equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \)

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \)

So we need to find integers \( a, b, c \) such that these combinations hold. Let&#x27;s list possible cases.

Case 1: \( a + b = 2 \)

Then, equation 1 gives \( 2 + u - w = 2.98 \), so \( u - w = 0.98 \). Since \( u, w \in [0,1) \), \( u = w + 0.98 \). But since \( u &lt; 1 \), \( w + 0.98 &lt; 1 \implies w &lt; 0.02 \). Similarly, \( w = u - 0.98 \geq 0 - 0.98 = -0.98 \), but \( w \geq 0 \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 0.02 \).

So \( w \in [0, 0.02) \), and \( u = w + 0.98 \in [0.98, 1.0) \). But \( u must be less than 1, so that&#x27;s okay.

Case 1, equation 1: \( u = w + 0.98 \), \( w \in [0, 0.02) \)

Now, proceed to equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \). Let&#x27;s suppose:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then from equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v \in [0,1) \), so \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u = w + 0.98 \), and \( w &lt; 0.02 \implies u &lt; 0.98 + 0.02 = 1.0 \), so actually \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \). So for \( v = u + 0.01 \), we need \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Therefore, combining with \( u \geq 0.98 \), \( u \in [0.98, 0.99) \), which implies \( w = u - 0.98 \in [0, 0.01) \), and \( v \in [0.99, 1.0) \). But \( v must be less than 1, so okay.

Alternatively, if \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v \geq 0 \implies u - 0.99 \geq 0 \implies u \geq 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \), so \( u \geq 0.99 \implies u \in [0.99, 1.0) \). Then \( v = u - 0.99 \in [0, 0.01) \). But \( u \in [0.99, 1.0) \), so \( v \in [0, 0.01) \).

So in Case 1, equation 3 can split into two subcases: \( b + c = 5 \) leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \), or \( b + c = 6 \) leading to \( v = u - 0.99 \).

Let me hold onto that and check equation 2.

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \).

But since in Case 1, \( a + b = 2 \), and equation 3 has \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), we can express \( a - c \) in terms of \( (a + b) - (b + c) + 2c \). Wait, maybe it&#x27;s better to relate variables.

Given \( a + b = 2 \), and \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), then:

If \( a + b = 2 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtracting the first from the second: \( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 2 \implies c - a = 3 \implies c = a + 3 \)

Similarly, if \( b + c = 6 \), then \( c - a = 6 - 2 = 4 \implies c = a + 4 \)

So equation 2 is \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \). But from above:

If \( c = a + 3 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 3) = -3 \), which is not 4 or 5. So that&#x27;s impossible.

If \( c = a + 4 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 4) = -4 \), which is also not 4 or 5. So in Case 1, regardless of \( b + c = 5 \) or 6, \( a - c \) is -3 or -4, which doesn&#x27;t match the possible equation 2 values (4 or 5). Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.

Thus, there are no solutions when \( a + b = 2 \).

Proceeding to Case 2: \( a + b = 3 \)

Then equation 1: \( 3 + u - w = 2.98 \implies u - w = -0.02 \implies u = w - 0.02 \)

But \( u \geq 0 \implies w - 0.02 \geq 0 \implies w \geq 0.02 \). Also, \( w &lt; 1 \implies u = w - 0.02 &lt; 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 \). So \( u \in [0, 0.98) \), and \( w = u + 0.02 \in [0.02, 1.0) \)

So equation 1 gives \( w = u + 0.02 \), \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), \( w ∈ [0.02, 1.0) \)

Now, equation 3: \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

Again, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6 (since the RHS is 5.01 + (u - v) which is between 4.01 and 6.01, as before). So similar to before:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v &lt; 1 \implies u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Which is already true because \( u &lt; 0.98 \). So \( v = u + 0.01 \), with \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), so \( v ∈ [0.01, 0.99) \)

If \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v ≥ 0 \implies u - 0.99 ≥ 0 \implies u ≥ 0.99 \). However, from equation 1, \( u &lt; 0.98 \), which conflicts. So this is impossible. Therefore, in Case 2, equation 3 must have \( b + c = 5 \), leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \)

So now, in Case 2, equations so far:

1. \( a + b = 3 \)
2. \( u = w - 0.02 \)
3. \( v = u + 0.01 = w - 0.02 + 0.01 = w - 0.01 \)
4. \( b + c = 5 \)
5. From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We can express \( a - c \). Since \( a + b = 3 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtract the first from the second:

\( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 3 \implies c - a = 2 \implies c = a + 2 \)

So substituting into equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

But \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - (a + 2) + v - w = -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so substituting:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = 6.05 \implies -0.01 = 6.05 \implies \)

This is impossible. Contradiction. So in Case 2, even with \( b + c =5 \), we end up with a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is impossible?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We have \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - c = -2 \)

Therefore, equation 2 becomes: \( -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = -0.01 = 6.05 \)

Which is not possible. Hence, contradiction. So even though we thought maybe Case 2 could work, the equations lead to a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is also impossible?

Wait, but both cases lead to contradictions. That can&#x27;t be. Then there are no solutions? But the problem states &quot;determine the number of real solutions&quot;, so maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple possibilities for \( a, b, c \). Wait, in Case 2, we have \( a + b = 3 \), \( b + c =5 \), so \( c = a + 2 \). Then in equation 2, substituting \( a - c = -2 \), and \( v - w \), but \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). Then equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = 4.05 \implies -2.01 =4.05 \), which is false. So that&#x27;s impossible.

But maybe I made a wrong assumption when I split the equations. Let me check again.

Wait, equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \). From Case 2:

We have \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). And \( a - c = -2 \). Therefore, equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = -2.01 \), which is not equal to 4.05. So indeed, no solution here.

Hmm. So both cases when \( a + b = 2 \) and \( 3 \) lead to contradictions. Therefore, does that mean there are no solutions? But the problem is from a competition, so it&#x27;s unlikely to have no solutions. Maybe I made a wrong approach.

Wait, let me check again the equations after substitution.

Original equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Variables:

- \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z} \)
- \( u, v, w ∈ [0,1) \)

Perhaps I need to solve these three equations for integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \).

Let me try to write these equations as linear equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to combine the equations to eliminate some variables.

First, add equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w = 7.99 \)

But equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Let me subtract equation 2 from the sum:

Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99 \)
Minus equation 2: \( (a - c + v - w) =4.05 \)
Result: \( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)
Simplify: \( 2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c =1.97 \)

But \( b + c \) must be integer since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. But 1.97 is not an integer. Contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that the system is inconsistent? But that can&#x27;t be. Wait, so even if we assume that the equations hold, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 leads to a non-integer sum, which contradicts that \( b + c \) must be integer. Therefore, there are no solutions?

But this is strange. Let me verify my steps again.

Adding equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =2.98 +5.01 =7.99 \)

Equation 2: \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Subtracting equation 2 from the sum:

\( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 2b + 2c =3.94 \implies b +c =1.97 \)

But since \( b, c \) are integers, \( b +c \) must be integer, but 1.97 is not. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, the system has no solution.

Therefore, the number of real solutions is zero.

But wait, this seems to be the case. But let me check if I added the equations correctly.

Equation 1: a + b + u - w =2.98

Equation 3: b + c + v - u =5.01

Sum: a + b + u - w + b + c + v - u =2.98 +5.01

Simplifies to: a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99

Equation 2: a - c + v - w =4.05

Subtract equation 2: (a +2b + c + v -w) - (a -c +v -w) =7.99 -4.05

Left side: a +2b +c +v -w -a +c -v +w =2b +2c

Right side:3.94

Thus, 2b +2c=3.94 =&gt; b +c=1.97, which is impossible because b and c are integers. Therefore, the system is inconsistent, no solutions.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check again for possible miscalculations.

Wait, the problem says &quot;real solutions&quot;, but in the equations, floor and fractional parts are involved, so variables x, y, z are real numbers, but with their floor and fractional parts.

But according to the above, the equations lead to a contradiction, so there&#x27;s no solution.

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the thought process. Let me check with different approaches.

Suppose I take equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w =2.98 \)

2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to express variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b =2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) integers, 2.98 -u +w must be integer. Since u, w are fractional parts, 0 ≤ u, w &lt;1, so 2.98 - u + w ∈ (2.98 -1 +0, 2.98 -0 +1) = (1.98, 3.98). Thus, possible integer values 2 or3.

Similarly, from equation3: \( b +c =5.01 -v +u \). 5.01 -v +u ∈ (5.01 -1 +0, 5.01 -0 +1)= (4.01,6.01). So integers 5 or6.

From equation2: \( a -c =4.05 -v +w \). 4.05 -v +w ∈ (4.05 -1 +0,4.05 -0 +1)= (3.05,5.05). So integers4 or5.

So possible combinations:

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

So total 8 cases. Let&#x27;s check each.

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4, subtract the equations: (a -c) - (a +b)=4 -2 =&gt; -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But from b +c=5, contradiction. So invalid.

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=2 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; -(c + b)=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Similarly, a -c=5 and a +b=2. Subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

All cases lead to contradictions. Hence, there are no solutions. Therefore, the system of equations has no real solutions. Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98, \\
\lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05, \\
-\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01,
\end{cases}
\]
we start by expressing each variable in terms of its integer and fractional parts. Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), and \( \{x\} = u \), \( \{y\} = v \), \( \{z\} = w \), where \( a, b, c \) are integers and \( u, v, w \) are fractional parts such that \( 0 \leq u, v, w &lt; 1 \).

Substituting these into the equations, we get:
1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

We analyze the possible integer values for \( a + b \), \( b + c \), and \( a - c \):
- From equation 1, \( a + b \) must be 2 or 3.
- From equation 3, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6.
- From equation 2, \( a - c \) must be 4 or 5.

We check all possible combinations of these integer values and find that each leads to a contradiction. For example, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 results in:
\[
2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c = 1.97
\]
which is impossible since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. Similarly, other combinations also lead to contradictions.

Thus, the system of equations is inconsistent and has no real solutions. The number of real solutions is:
\[
\boxed{0}

Response: \boxed{1}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to solve this system of equations with floor functions and fractional parts. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:

1. \( x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( \lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
3. \( -\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01 \)

Hmm, floor functions and fractional parts. Remember, for any real number \( a \), \( a = \lfloor a \rfloor + \{a\} \), where \( \lfloor a \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( a \), and \( \{a\} \) is the fractional part, so \( 0 \leq \{a\} &lt; 1 \).

Let me denote:

Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), so \( \{x\} = x - a \), where \( a \) is integer and \( 0 \leq \{x\} &lt; 1 \).

Similarly, \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \{y\} = y - b \), with \( b \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{y\} &lt; 1 \).

And \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), \( \{z\} = z - c \), \( c \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So substituting these into the equations:

1. \( x + b - (z - c) = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( x + b - z + c = 2.98 \)
   Since \( x = a + \{x\} \), and \( z = c + \{z\} \), substitute these:
   \( (a + \{x\}) + b - (c + \{z\}) + c = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{x\} + b - c - \{z\} + c = 2.98 \)
   So \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
   
2. \( a + (y - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Since \( y = b + \{y\} \), substitute:
   \( a + (b + \{y\} - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
   Again, \( z = c + \{z\} \), so:
   \( a + \{y\} - (c + \{z\}) = 4.05 \)
   Which becomes: \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)

3. \( -\{x\} + y + c = 5.01 \)
   Substitute \( y = b + \{y\} \):
   \( -\{x\} + b + \{y\} + c = 5.01 \)
   So: \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

So now, the transformed equations are:

1. \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

Additionally, we have the original variables:

- \( x = a + \{x\} \)
- \( y = b + \{y\} \)
- \( z = c + \{z\} \)

With \( a, b, c \) integers, and \( 0 \leq \{x\}, \{y\}, \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So maybe I can set variables for the fractional parts:

Let me denote:

- \( \{x\} = u \), so \( 0 \leq u &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{y\} = v \), so \( 0 \leq v &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{z\} = w \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 1 \)

So equations become:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

And variables:

- \( x = a + u \)
- \( y = b + v \)
- \( z = c + w \)

Now, the problem is to find integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \in [0,1) \) such that these equations hold.

So maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) are integers, and \( u, w \) are fractions between 0 and 1, the right-hand side (RHS) is 2.98 + (w - u). Since \( w - u \) can be between -1 and 1 (since both are less than 1), so the RHS is between 2.98 - 1 ≈ 1.98 and 2.98 + 1 ≈ 3.98. Therefore, \( a + b \) must be an integer in that interval, so possible values of \( a + b \) are 2 or 3.

Similarly, equation 3: \( b + c = 5.01 - v + u \). The RHS is 5.01 + (u - v). Since \( u - v \) is between -1 and 1, the RHS is between 4.01 and 6.01. Therefore, \( b + c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values are 5 or 6.

Equation 2: \( a - c = 4.05 - v + w \). RHS is 4.05 + (w - v). Since \( w - v \in (-1,1) \), the RHS is between 3.05 and 5.05. Therefore, \( a - c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values 4 or 5.

So let&#x27;s note the possible integer values:

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2 \) or \( 3 \)

From equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \)

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \)

So we need to find integers \( a, b, c \) such that these combinations hold. Let&#x27;s list possible cases.

Case 1: \( a + b = 2 \)

Then, equation 1 gives \( 2 + u - w = 2.98 \), so \( u - w = 0.98 \). Since \( u, w \in [0,1) \), \( u = w + 0.98 \). But since \( u &lt; 1 \), \( w + 0.98 &lt; 1 \implies w &lt; 0.02 \). Similarly, \( w = u - 0.98 \geq 0 - 0.98 = -0.98 \), but \( w \geq 0 \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 0.02 \).

So \( w \in [0, 0.02) \), and \( u = w + 0.98 \in [0.98, 1.0) \). But \( u must be less than 1, so that&#x27;s okay.

Case 1, equation 1: \( u = w + 0.98 \), \( w \in [0, 0.02) \)

Now, proceed to equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \). Let&#x27;s suppose:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then from equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v \in [0,1) \), so \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u = w + 0.98 \), and \( w &lt; 0.02 \implies u &lt; 0.98 + 0.02 = 1.0 \), so actually \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \). So for \( v = u + 0.01 \), we need \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Therefore, combining with \( u \geq 0.98 \), \( u \in [0.98, 0.99) \), which implies \( w = u - 0.98 \in [0, 0.01) \), and \( v \in [0.99, 1.0) \). But \( v must be less than 1, so okay.

Alternatively, if \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v \geq 0 \implies u - 0.99 \geq 0 \implies u \geq 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \), so \( u \geq 0.99 \implies u \in [0.99, 1.0) \). Then \( v = u - 0.99 \in [0, 0.01) \). But \( u \in [0.99, 1.0) \), so \( v \in [0, 0.01) \).

So in Case 1, equation 3 can split into two subcases: \( b + c = 5 \) leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \), or \( b + c = 6 \) leading to \( v = u - 0.99 \).

Let me hold onto that and check equation 2.

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \).

But since in Case 1, \( a + b = 2 \), and equation 3 has \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), we can express \( a - c \) in terms of \( (a + b) - (b + c) + 2c \). Wait, maybe it&#x27;s better to relate variables.

Given \( a + b = 2 \), and \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), then:

If \( a + b = 2 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtracting the first from the second: \( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 2 \implies c - a = 3 \implies c = a + 3 \)

Similarly, if \( b + c = 6 \), then \( c - a = 6 - 2 = 4 \implies c = a + 4 \)

So equation 2 is \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \). But from above:

If \( c = a + 3 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 3) = -3 \), which is not 4 or 5. So that&#x27;s impossible.

If \( c = a + 4 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 4) = -4 \), which is also not 4 or 5. So in Case 1, regardless of \( b + c = 5 \) or 6, \( a - c \) is -3 or -4, which doesn&#x27;t match the possible equation 2 values (4 or 5). Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.

Thus, there are no solutions when \( a + b = 2 \).

Proceeding to Case 2: \( a + b = 3 \)

Then equation 1: \( 3 + u - w = 2.98 \implies u - w = -0.02 \implies u = w - 0.02 \)

But \( u \geq 0 \implies w - 0.02 \geq 0 \implies w \geq 0.02 \). Also, \( w &lt; 1 \implies u = w - 0.02 &lt; 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 \). So \( u \in [0, 0.98) \), and \( w = u + 0.02 \in [0.02, 1.0) \)

So equation 1 gives \( w = u + 0.02 \), \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), \( w ∈ [0.02, 1.0) \)

Now, equation 3: \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

Again, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6 (since the RHS is 5.01 + (u - v) which is between 4.01 and 6.01, as before). So similar to before:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v &lt; 1 \implies u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Which is already true because \( u &lt; 0.98 \). So \( v = u + 0.01 \), with \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), so \( v ∈ [0.01, 0.99) \)

If \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v ≥ 0 \implies u - 0.99 ≥ 0 \implies u ≥ 0.99 \). However, from equation 1, \( u &lt; 0.98 \), which conflicts. So this is impossible. Therefore, in Case 2, equation 3 must have \( b + c = 5 \), leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \)

So now, in Case 2, equations so far:

1. \( a + b = 3 \)
2. \( u = w - 0.02 \)
3. \( v = u + 0.01 = w - 0.02 + 0.01 = w - 0.01 \)
4. \( b + c = 5 \)
5. From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We can express \( a - c \). Since \( a + b = 3 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtract the first from the second:

\( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 3 \implies c - a = 2 \implies c = a + 2 \)

So substituting into equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

But \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - (a + 2) + v - w = -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so substituting:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = 6.05 \implies -0.01 = 6.05 \implies \)

This is impossible. Contradiction. So in Case 2, even with \( b + c =5 \), we end up with a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is impossible?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We have \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - c = -2 \)

Therefore, equation 2 becomes: \( -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = -0.01 = 6.05 \)

Which is not possible. Hence, contradiction. So even though we thought maybe Case 2 could work, the equations lead to a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is also impossible?

Wait, but both cases lead to contradictions. That can&#x27;t be. Then there are no solutions? But the problem states &quot;determine the number of real solutions&quot;, so maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple possibilities for \( a, b, c \). Wait, in Case 2, we have \( a + b = 3 \), \( b + c =5 \), so \( c = a + 2 \). Then in equation 2, substituting \( a - c = -2 \), and \( v - w \), but \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). Then equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = 4.05 \implies -2.01 =4.05 \), which is false. So that&#x27;s impossible.

But maybe I made a wrong assumption when I split the equations. Let me check again.

Wait, equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \). From Case 2:

We have \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). And \( a - c = -2 \). Therefore, equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = -2.01 \), which is not equal to 4.05. So indeed, no solution here.

Hmm. So both cases when \( a + b = 2 \) and \( 3 \) lead to contradictions. Therefore, does that mean there are no solutions? But the problem is from a competition, so it&#x27;s unlikely to have no solutions. Maybe I made a wrong approach.

Wait, let me check again the equations after substitution.

Original equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Variables:

- \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z} \)
- \( u, v, w ∈ [0,1) \)

Perhaps I need to solve these three equations for integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \).

Let me try to write these equations as linear equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to combine the equations to eliminate some variables.

First, add equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w = 7.99 \)

But equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Let me subtract equation 2 from the sum:

Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99 \)
Minus equation 2: \( (a - c + v - w) =4.05 \)
Result: \( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)
Simplify: \( 2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c =1.97 \)

But \( b + c \) must be integer since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. But 1.97 is not an integer. Contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that the system is inconsistent? But that can&#x27;t be. Wait, so even if we assume that the equations hold, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 leads to a non-integer sum, which contradicts that \( b + c \) must be integer. Therefore, there are no solutions?

But this is strange. Let me verify my steps again.

Adding equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =2.98 +5.01 =7.99 \)

Equation 2: \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Subtracting equation 2 from the sum:

\( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 2b + 2c =3.94 \implies b +c =1.97 \)

But since \( b, c \) are integers, \( b +c \) must be integer, but 1.97 is not. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, the system has no solution.

Therefore, the number of real solutions is zero.

But wait, this seems to be the case. But let me check if I added the equations correctly.

Equation 1: a + b + u - w =2.98

Equation 3: b + c + v - u =5.01

Sum: a + b + u - w + b + c + v - u =2.98 +5.01

Simplifies to: a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99

Equation 2: a - c + v - w =4.05

Subtract equation 2: (a +2b + c + v -w) - (a -c +v -w) =7.99 -4.05

Left side: a +2b +c +v -w -a +c -v +w =2b +2c

Right side:3.94

Thus, 2b +2c=3.94 =&gt; b +c=1.97, which is impossible because b and c are integers. Therefore, the system is inconsistent, no solutions.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check again for possible miscalculations.

Wait, the problem says &quot;real solutions&quot;, but in the equations, floor and fractional parts are involved, so variables x, y, z are real numbers, but with their floor and fractional parts.

But according to the above, the equations lead to a contradiction, so there&#x27;s no solution.

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the thought process. Let me check with different approaches.

Suppose I take equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w =2.98 \)

2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to express variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b =2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) integers, 2.98 -u +w must be integer. Since u, w are fractional parts, 0 ≤ u, w &lt;1, so 2.98 - u + w ∈ (2.98 -1 +0, 2.98 -0 +1) = (1.98, 3.98). Thus, possible integer values 2 or3.

Similarly, from equation3: \( b +c =5.01 -v +u \). 5.01 -v +u ∈ (5.01 -1 +0, 5.01 -0 +1)= (4.01,6.01). So integers 5 or6.

From equation2: \( a -c =4.05 -v +w \). 4.05 -v +w ∈ (4.05 -1 +0,4.05 -0 +1)= (3.05,5.05). So integers4 or5.

So possible combinations:

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

So total 8 cases. Let&#x27;s check each.

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4, subtract the equations: (a -c) - (a +b)=4 -2 =&gt; -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But from b +c=5, contradiction. So invalid.

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=2 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; -(c + b)=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Similarly, a -c=5 and a +b=2. Subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

All cases lead to contradictions. Hence, there are no solutions. Therefore, the system of equations has no real solutions. Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98, \\
\lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05, \\
-\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01,
\end{cases}
\]
we start by expressing each variable in terms of its integer and fractional parts. Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), and \( \{x\} = u \), \( \{y\} = v \), \( \{z\} = w \), where \( a, b, c \) are integers and \( u, v, w \) are fractional parts such that \( 0 \leq u, v, w &lt; 1 \).

Substituting these into the equations, we get:
1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

We analyze the possible integer values for \( a + b \), \( b + c \), and \( a - c \):
- From equation 1, \( a + b \) must be 2 or 3.
- From equation 3, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6.
- From equation 2, \( a - c \) must be 4 or 5.

We check all possible combinations of these integer values and find that each leads to a contradiction. For example, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 results in:
\[
2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c = 1.97
\]
which is impossible since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. Similarly, other combinations also lead to contradictions.

Thus, the system of equations is inconsistent and has no real solutions. The number of real solutions is:
\[
\boxed{0}

Response: \boxed{2}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to solve this system of equations with floor functions and fractional parts. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:

1. \( x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( \lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
3. \( -\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01 \)

Hmm, floor functions and fractional parts. Remember, for any real number \( a \), \( a = \lfloor a \rfloor + \{a\} \), where \( \lfloor a \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( a \), and \( \{a\} \) is the fractional part, so \( 0 \leq \{a\} &lt; 1 \).

Let me denote:

Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), so \( \{x\} = x - a \), where \( a \) is integer and \( 0 \leq \{x\} &lt; 1 \).

Similarly, \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \{y\} = y - b \), with \( b \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{y\} &lt; 1 \).

And \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), \( \{z\} = z - c \), \( c \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So substituting these into the equations:

1. \( x + b - (z - c) = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( x + b - z + c = 2.98 \)
   Since \( x = a + \{x\} \), and \( z = c + \{z\} \), substitute these:
   \( (a + \{x\}) + b - (c + \{z\}) + c = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{x\} + b - c - \{z\} + c = 2.98 \)
   So \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
   
2. \( a + (y - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Since \( y = b + \{y\} \), substitute:
   \( a + (b + \{y\} - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
   Again, \( z = c + \{z\} \), so:
   \( a + \{y\} - (c + \{z\}) = 4.05 \)
   Which becomes: \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)

3. \( -\{x\} + y + c = 5.01 \)
   Substitute \( y = b + \{y\} \):
   \( -\{x\} + b + \{y\} + c = 5.01 \)
   So: \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

So now, the transformed equations are:

1. \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

Additionally, we have the original variables:

- \( x = a + \{x\} \)
- \( y = b + \{y\} \)
- \( z = c + \{z\} \)

With \( a, b, c \) integers, and \( 0 \leq \{x\}, \{y\}, \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So maybe I can set variables for the fractional parts:

Let me denote:

- \( \{x\} = u \), so \( 0 \leq u &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{y\} = v \), so \( 0 \leq v &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{z\} = w \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 1 \)

So equations become:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

And variables:

- \( x = a + u \)
- \( y = b + v \)
- \( z = c + w \)

Now, the problem is to find integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \in [0,1) \) such that these equations hold.

So maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) are integers, and \( u, w \) are fractions between 0 and 1, the right-hand side (RHS) is 2.98 + (w - u). Since \( w - u \) can be between -1 and 1 (since both are less than 1), so the RHS is between 2.98 - 1 ≈ 1.98 and 2.98 + 1 ≈ 3.98. Therefore, \( a + b \) must be an integer in that interval, so possible values of \( a + b \) are 2 or 3.

Similarly, equation 3: \( b + c = 5.01 - v + u \). The RHS is 5.01 + (u - v). Since \( u - v \) is between -1 and 1, the RHS is between 4.01 and 6.01. Therefore, \( b + c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values are 5 or 6.

Equation 2: \( a - c = 4.05 - v + w \). RHS is 4.05 + (w - v). Since \( w - v \in (-1,1) \), the RHS is between 3.05 and 5.05. Therefore, \( a - c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values 4 or 5.

So let&#x27;s note the possible integer values:

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2 \) or \( 3 \)

From equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \)

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \)

So we need to find integers \( a, b, c \) such that these combinations hold. Let&#x27;s list possible cases.

Case 1: \( a + b = 2 \)

Then, equation 1 gives \( 2 + u - w = 2.98 \), so \( u - w = 0.98 \). Since \( u, w \in [0,1) \), \( u = w + 0.98 \). But since \( u &lt; 1 \), \( w + 0.98 &lt; 1 \implies w &lt; 0.02 \). Similarly, \( w = u - 0.98 \geq 0 - 0.98 = -0.98 \), but \( w \geq 0 \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 0.02 \).

So \( w \in [0, 0.02) \), and \( u = w + 0.98 \in [0.98, 1.0) \). But \( u must be less than 1, so that&#x27;s okay.

Case 1, equation 1: \( u = w + 0.98 \), \( w \in [0, 0.02) \)

Now, proceed to equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \). Let&#x27;s suppose:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then from equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v \in [0,1) \), so \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u = w + 0.98 \), and \( w &lt; 0.02 \implies u &lt; 0.98 + 0.02 = 1.0 \), so actually \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \). So for \( v = u + 0.01 \), we need \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Therefore, combining with \( u \geq 0.98 \), \( u \in [0.98, 0.99) \), which implies \( w = u - 0.98 \in [0, 0.01) \), and \( v \in [0.99, 1.0) \). But \( v must be less than 1, so okay.

Alternatively, if \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v \geq 0 \implies u - 0.99 \geq 0 \implies u \geq 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \), so \( u \geq 0.99 \implies u \in [0.99, 1.0) \). Then \( v = u - 0.99 \in [0, 0.01) \). But \( u \in [0.99, 1.0) \), so \( v \in [0, 0.01) \).

So in Case 1, equation 3 can split into two subcases: \( b + c = 5 \) leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \), or \( b + c = 6 \) leading to \( v = u - 0.99 \).

Let me hold onto that and check equation 2.

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \).

But since in Case 1, \( a + b = 2 \), and equation 3 has \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), we can express \( a - c \) in terms of \( (a + b) - (b + c) + 2c \). Wait, maybe it&#x27;s better to relate variables.

Given \( a + b = 2 \), and \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), then:

If \( a + b = 2 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtracting the first from the second: \( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 2 \implies c - a = 3 \implies c = a + 3 \)

Similarly, if \( b + c = 6 \), then \( c - a = 6 - 2 = 4 \implies c = a + 4 \)

So equation 2 is \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \). But from above:

If \( c = a + 3 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 3) = -3 \), which is not 4 or 5. So that&#x27;s impossible.

If \( c = a + 4 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 4) = -4 \), which is also not 4 or 5. So in Case 1, regardless of \( b + c = 5 \) or 6, \( a - c \) is -3 or -4, which doesn&#x27;t match the possible equation 2 values (4 or 5). Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.

Thus, there are no solutions when \( a + b = 2 \).

Proceeding to Case 2: \( a + b = 3 \)

Then equation 1: \( 3 + u - w = 2.98 \implies u - w = -0.02 \implies u = w - 0.02 \)

But \( u \geq 0 \implies w - 0.02 \geq 0 \implies w \geq 0.02 \). Also, \( w &lt; 1 \implies u = w - 0.02 &lt; 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 \). So \( u \in [0, 0.98) \), and \( w = u + 0.02 \in [0.02, 1.0) \)

So equation 1 gives \( w = u + 0.02 \), \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), \( w ∈ [0.02, 1.0) \)

Now, equation 3: \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

Again, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6 (since the RHS is 5.01 + (u - v) which is between 4.01 and 6.01, as before). So similar to before:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v &lt; 1 \implies u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Which is already true because \( u &lt; 0.98 \). So \( v = u + 0.01 \), with \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), so \( v ∈ [0.01, 0.99) \)

If \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v ≥ 0 \implies u - 0.99 ≥ 0 \implies u ≥ 0.99 \). However, from equation 1, \( u &lt; 0.98 \), which conflicts. So this is impossible. Therefore, in Case 2, equation 3 must have \( b + c = 5 \), leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \)

So now, in Case 2, equations so far:

1. \( a + b = 3 \)
2. \( u = w - 0.02 \)
3. \( v = u + 0.01 = w - 0.02 + 0.01 = w - 0.01 \)
4. \( b + c = 5 \)
5. From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We can express \( a - c \). Since \( a + b = 3 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtract the first from the second:

\( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 3 \implies c - a = 2 \implies c = a + 2 \)

So substituting into equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

But \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - (a + 2) + v - w = -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so substituting:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = 6.05 \implies -0.01 = 6.05 \implies \)

This is impossible. Contradiction. So in Case 2, even with \( b + c =5 \), we end up with a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is impossible?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We have \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - c = -2 \)

Therefore, equation 2 becomes: \( -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = -0.01 = 6.05 \)

Which is not possible. Hence, contradiction. So even though we thought maybe Case 2 could work, the equations lead to a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is also impossible?

Wait, but both cases lead to contradictions. That can&#x27;t be. Then there are no solutions? But the problem states &quot;determine the number of real solutions&quot;, so maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple possibilities for \( a, b, c \). Wait, in Case 2, we have \( a + b = 3 \), \( b + c =5 \), so \( c = a + 2 \). Then in equation 2, substituting \( a - c = -2 \), and \( v - w \), but \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). Then equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = 4.05 \implies -2.01 =4.05 \), which is false. So that&#x27;s impossible.

But maybe I made a wrong assumption when I split the equations. Let me check again.

Wait, equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \). From Case 2:

We have \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). And \( a - c = -2 \). Therefore, equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = -2.01 \), which is not equal to 4.05. So indeed, no solution here.

Hmm. So both cases when \( a + b = 2 \) and \( 3 \) lead to contradictions. Therefore, does that mean there are no solutions? But the problem is from a competition, so it&#x27;s unlikely to have no solutions. Maybe I made a wrong approach.

Wait, let me check again the equations after substitution.

Original equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Variables:

- \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z} \)
- \( u, v, w ∈ [0,1) \)

Perhaps I need to solve these three equations for integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \).

Let me try to write these equations as linear equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to combine the equations to eliminate some variables.

First, add equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w = 7.99 \)

But equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Let me subtract equation 2 from the sum:

Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99 \)
Minus equation 2: \( (a - c + v - w) =4.05 \)
Result: \( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)
Simplify: \( 2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c =1.97 \)

But \( b + c \) must be integer since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. But 1.97 is not an integer. Contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that the system is inconsistent? But that can&#x27;t be. Wait, so even if we assume that the equations hold, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 leads to a non-integer sum, which contradicts that \( b + c \) must be integer. Therefore, there are no solutions?

But this is strange. Let me verify my steps again.

Adding equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =2.98 +5.01 =7.99 \)

Equation 2: \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Subtracting equation 2 from the sum:

\( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 2b + 2c =3.94 \implies b +c =1.97 \)

But since \( b, c \) are integers, \( b +c \) must be integer, but 1.97 is not. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, the system has no solution.

Therefore, the number of real solutions is zero.

But wait, this seems to be the case. But let me check if I added the equations correctly.

Equation 1: a + b + u - w =2.98

Equation 3: b + c + v - u =5.01

Sum: a + b + u - w + b + c + v - u =2.98 +5.01

Simplifies to: a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99

Equation 2: a - c + v - w =4.05

Subtract equation 2: (a +2b + c + v -w) - (a -c +v -w) =7.99 -4.05

Left side: a +2b +c +v -w -a +c -v +w =2b +2c

Right side:3.94

Thus, 2b +2c=3.94 =&gt; b +c=1.97, which is impossible because b and c are integers. Therefore, the system is inconsistent, no solutions.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check again for possible miscalculations.

Wait, the problem says &quot;real solutions&quot;, but in the equations, floor and fractional parts are involved, so variables x, y, z are real numbers, but with their floor and fractional parts.

But according to the above, the equations lead to a contradiction, so there&#x27;s no solution.

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the thought process. Let me check with different approaches.

Suppose I take equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w =2.98 \)

2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to express variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b =2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) integers, 2.98 -u +w must be integer. Since u, w are fractional parts, 0 ≤ u, w &lt;1, so 2.98 - u + w ∈ (2.98 -1 +0, 2.98 -0 +1) = (1.98, 3.98). Thus, possible integer values 2 or3.

Similarly, from equation3: \( b +c =5.01 -v +u \). 5.01 -v +u ∈ (5.01 -1 +0, 5.01 -0 +1)= (4.01,6.01). So integers 5 or6.

From equation2: \( a -c =4.05 -v +w \). 4.05 -v +w ∈ (4.05 -1 +0,4.05 -0 +1)= (3.05,5.05). So integers4 or5.

So possible combinations:

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

So total 8 cases. Let&#x27;s check each.

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4, subtract the equations: (a -c) - (a +b)=4 -2 =&gt; -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But from b +c=5, contradiction. So invalid.

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=2 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; -(c + b)=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Similarly, a -c=5 and a +b=2. Subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

All cases lead to contradictions. Hence, there are no solutions. Therefore, the system of equations has no real solutions. Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98, \\
\lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05, \\
-\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01,
\end{cases}
\]
we start by expressing each variable in terms of its integer and fractional parts. Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), and \( \{x\} = u \), \( \{y\} = v \), \( \{z\} = w \), where \( a, b, c \) are integers and \( u, v, w \) are fractional parts such that \( 0 \leq u, v, w &lt; 1 \).

Substituting these into the equations, we get:
1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

We analyze the possible integer values for \( a + b \), \( b + c \), and \( a - c \):
- From equation 1, \( a + b \) must be 2 or 3.
- From equation 3, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6.
- From equation 2, \( a - c \) must be 4 or 5.

We check all possible combinations of these integer values and find that each leads to a contradiction. For example, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 results in:
\[
2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c = 1.97
\]
which is impossible since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. Similarly, other combinations also lead to contradictions.

Thus, the system of equations is inconsistent and has no real solutions. The number of real solutions is:
\[
\boxed{0}

Response: \boxed{1}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to solve this system of equations with floor functions and fractional parts. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:

1. \( x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( \lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
3. \( -\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01 \)

Hmm, floor functions and fractional parts. Remember, for any real number \( a \), \( a = \lfloor a \rfloor + \{a\} \), where \( \lfloor a \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( a \), and \( \{a\} \) is the fractional part, so \( 0 \leq \{a\} &lt; 1 \).

Let me denote:

Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), so \( \{x\} = x - a \), where \( a \) is integer and \( 0 \leq \{x\} &lt; 1 \).

Similarly, \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \{y\} = y - b \), with \( b \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{y\} &lt; 1 \).

And \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), \( \{z\} = z - c \), \( c \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So substituting these into the equations:

1. \( x + b - (z - c) = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( x + b - z + c = 2.98 \)
   Since \( x = a + \{x\} \), and \( z = c + \{z\} \), substitute these:
   \( (a + \{x\}) + b - (c + \{z\}) + c = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{x\} + b - c - \{z\} + c = 2.98 \)
   So \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
   
2. \( a + (y - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Since \( y = b + \{y\} \), substitute:
   \( a + (b + \{y\} - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
   Again, \( z = c + \{z\} \), so:
   \( a + \{y\} - (c + \{z\}) = 4.05 \)
   Which becomes: \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)

3. \( -\{x\} + y + c = 5.01 \)
   Substitute \( y = b + \{y\} \):
   \( -\{x\} + b + \{y\} + c = 5.01 \)
   So: \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

So now, the transformed equations are:

1. \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

Additionally, we have the original variables:

- \( x = a + \{x\} \)
- \( y = b + \{y\} \)
- \( z = c + \{z\} \)

With \( a, b, c \) integers, and \( 0 \leq \{x\}, \{y\}, \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So maybe I can set variables for the fractional parts:

Let me denote:

- \( \{x\} = u \), so \( 0 \leq u &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{y\} = v \), so \( 0 \leq v &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{z\} = w \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 1 \)

So equations become:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

And variables:

- \( x = a + u \)
- \( y = b + v \)
- \( z = c + w \)

Now, the problem is to find integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \in [0,1) \) such that these equations hold.

So maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) are integers, and \( u, w \) are fractions between 0 and 1, the right-hand side (RHS) is 2.98 + (w - u). Since \( w - u \) can be between -1 and 1 (since both are less than 1), so the RHS is between 2.98 - 1 ≈ 1.98 and 2.98 + 1 ≈ 3.98. Therefore, \( a + b \) must be an integer in that interval, so possible values of \( a + b \) are 2 or 3.

Similarly, equation 3: \( b + c = 5.01 - v + u \). The RHS is 5.01 + (u - v). Since \( u - v \) is between -1 and 1, the RHS is between 4.01 and 6.01. Therefore, \( b + c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values are 5 or 6.

Equation 2: \( a - c = 4.05 - v + w \). RHS is 4.05 + (w - v). Since \( w - v \in (-1,1) \), the RHS is between 3.05 and 5.05. Therefore, \( a - c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values 4 or 5.

So let&#x27;s note the possible integer values:

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2 \) or \( 3 \)

From equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \)

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \)

So we need to find integers \( a, b, c \) such that these combinations hold. Let&#x27;s list possible cases.

Case 1: \( a + b = 2 \)

Then, equation 1 gives \( 2 + u - w = 2.98 \), so \( u - w = 0.98 \). Since \( u, w \in [0,1) \), \( u = w + 0.98 \). But since \( u &lt; 1 \), \( w + 0.98 &lt; 1 \implies w &lt; 0.02 \). Similarly, \( w = u - 0.98 \geq 0 - 0.98 = -0.98 \), but \( w \geq 0 \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 0.02 \).

So \( w \in [0, 0.02) \), and \( u = w + 0.98 \in [0.98, 1.0) \). But \( u must be less than 1, so that&#x27;s okay.

Case 1, equation 1: \( u = w + 0.98 \), \( w \in [0, 0.02) \)

Now, proceed to equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \). Let&#x27;s suppose:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then from equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v \in [0,1) \), so \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u = w + 0.98 \), and \( w &lt; 0.02 \implies u &lt; 0.98 + 0.02 = 1.0 \), so actually \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \). So for \( v = u + 0.01 \), we need \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Therefore, combining with \( u \geq 0.98 \), \( u \in [0.98, 0.99) \), which implies \( w = u - 0.98 \in [0, 0.01) \), and \( v \in [0.99, 1.0) \). But \( v must be less than 1, so okay.

Alternatively, if \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v \geq 0 \implies u - 0.99 \geq 0 \implies u \geq 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \), so \( u \geq 0.99 \implies u \in [0.99, 1.0) \). Then \( v = u - 0.99 \in [0, 0.01) \). But \( u \in [0.99, 1.0) \), so \( v \in [0, 0.01) \).

So in Case 1, equation 3 can split into two subcases: \( b + c = 5 \) leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \), or \( b + c = 6 \) leading to \( v = u - 0.99 \).

Let me hold onto that and check equation 2.

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \).

But since in Case 1, \( a + b = 2 \), and equation 3 has \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), we can express \( a - c \) in terms of \( (a + b) - (b + c) + 2c \). Wait, maybe it&#x27;s better to relate variables.

Given \( a + b = 2 \), and \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), then:

If \( a + b = 2 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtracting the first from the second: \( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 2 \implies c - a = 3 \implies c = a + 3 \)

Similarly, if \( b + c = 6 \), then \( c - a = 6 - 2 = 4 \implies c = a + 4 \)

So equation 2 is \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \). But from above:

If \( c = a + 3 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 3) = -3 \), which is not 4 or 5. So that&#x27;s impossible.

If \( c = a + 4 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 4) = -4 \), which is also not 4 or 5. So in Case 1, regardless of \( b + c = 5 \) or 6, \( a - c \) is -3 or -4, which doesn&#x27;t match the possible equation 2 values (4 or 5). Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.

Thus, there are no solutions when \( a + b = 2 \).

Proceeding to Case 2: \( a + b = 3 \)

Then equation 1: \( 3 + u - w = 2.98 \implies u - w = -0.02 \implies u = w - 0.02 \)

But \( u \geq 0 \implies w - 0.02 \geq 0 \implies w \geq 0.02 \). Also, \( w &lt; 1 \implies u = w - 0.02 &lt; 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 \). So \( u \in [0, 0.98) \), and \( w = u + 0.02 \in [0.02, 1.0) \)

So equation 1 gives \( w = u + 0.02 \), \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), \( w ∈ [0.02, 1.0) \)

Now, equation 3: \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

Again, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6 (since the RHS is 5.01 + (u - v) which is between 4.01 and 6.01, as before). So similar to before:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v &lt; 1 \implies u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Which is already true because \( u &lt; 0.98 \). So \( v = u + 0.01 \), with \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), so \( v ∈ [0.01, 0.99) \)

If \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v ≥ 0 \implies u - 0.99 ≥ 0 \implies u ≥ 0.99 \). However, from equation 1, \( u &lt; 0.98 \), which conflicts. So this is impossible. Therefore, in Case 2, equation 3 must have \( b + c = 5 \), leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \)

So now, in Case 2, equations so far:

1. \( a + b = 3 \)
2. \( u = w - 0.02 \)
3. \( v = u + 0.01 = w - 0.02 + 0.01 = w - 0.01 \)
4. \( b + c = 5 \)
5. From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We can express \( a - c \). Since \( a + b = 3 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtract the first from the second:

\( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 3 \implies c - a = 2 \implies c = a + 2 \)

So substituting into equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

But \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - (a + 2) + v - w = -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so substituting:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = 6.05 \implies -0.01 = 6.05 \implies \)

This is impossible. Contradiction. So in Case 2, even with \( b + c =5 \), we end up with a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is impossible?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We have \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - c = -2 \)

Therefore, equation 2 becomes: \( -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = -0.01 = 6.05 \)

Which is not possible. Hence, contradiction. So even though we thought maybe Case 2 could work, the equations lead to a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is also impossible?

Wait, but both cases lead to contradictions. That can&#x27;t be. Then there are no solutions? But the problem states &quot;determine the number of real solutions&quot;, so maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple possibilities for \( a, b, c \). Wait, in Case 2, we have \( a + b = 3 \), \( b + c =5 \), so \( c = a + 2 \). Then in equation 2, substituting \( a - c = -2 \), and \( v - w \), but \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). Then equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = 4.05 \implies -2.01 =4.05 \), which is false. So that&#x27;s impossible.

But maybe I made a wrong assumption when I split the equations. Let me check again.

Wait, equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \). From Case 2:

We have \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). And \( a - c = -2 \). Therefore, equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = -2.01 \), which is not equal to 4.05. So indeed, no solution here.

Hmm. So both cases when \( a + b = 2 \) and \( 3 \) lead to contradictions. Therefore, does that mean there are no solutions? But the problem is from a competition, so it&#x27;s unlikely to have no solutions. Maybe I made a wrong approach.

Wait, let me check again the equations after substitution.

Original equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Variables:

- \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z} \)
- \( u, v, w ∈ [0,1) \)

Perhaps I need to solve these three equations for integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \).

Let me try to write these equations as linear equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to combine the equations to eliminate some variables.

First, add equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w = 7.99 \)

But equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Let me subtract equation 2 from the sum:

Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99 \)
Minus equation 2: \( (a - c + v - w) =4.05 \)
Result: \( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)
Simplify: \( 2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c =1.97 \)

But \( b + c \) must be integer since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. But 1.97 is not an integer. Contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that the system is inconsistent? But that can&#x27;t be. Wait, so even if we assume that the equations hold, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 leads to a non-integer sum, which contradicts that \( b + c \) must be integer. Therefore, there are no solutions?

But this is strange. Let me verify my steps again.

Adding equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =2.98 +5.01 =7.99 \)

Equation 2: \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Subtracting equation 2 from the sum:

\( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 2b + 2c =3.94 \implies b +c =1.97 \)

But since \( b, c \) are integers, \( b +c \) must be integer, but 1.97 is not. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, the system has no solution.

Therefore, the number of real solutions is zero.

But wait, this seems to be the case. But let me check if I added the equations correctly.

Equation 1: a + b + u - w =2.98

Equation 3: b + c + v - u =5.01

Sum: a + b + u - w + b + c + v - u =2.98 +5.01

Simplifies to: a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99

Equation 2: a - c + v - w =4.05

Subtract equation 2: (a +2b + c + v -w) - (a -c +v -w) =7.99 -4.05

Left side: a +2b +c +v -w -a +c -v +w =2b +2c

Right side:3.94

Thus, 2b +2c=3.94 =&gt; b +c=1.97, which is impossible because b and c are integers. Therefore, the system is inconsistent, no solutions.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check again for possible miscalculations.

Wait, the problem says &quot;real solutions&quot;, but in the equations, floor and fractional parts are involved, so variables x, y, z are real numbers, but with their floor and fractional parts.

But according to the above, the equations lead to a contradiction, so there&#x27;s no solution.

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the thought process. Let me check with different approaches.

Suppose I take equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w =2.98 \)

2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to express variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b =2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) integers, 2.98 -u +w must be integer. Since u, w are fractional parts, 0 ≤ u, w &lt;1, so 2.98 - u + w ∈ (2.98 -1 +0, 2.98 -0 +1) = (1.98, 3.98). Thus, possible integer values 2 or3.

Similarly, from equation3: \( b +c =5.01 -v +u \). 5.01 -v +u ∈ (5.01 -1 +0, 5.01 -0 +1)= (4.01,6.01). So integers 5 or6.

From equation2: \( a -c =4.05 -v +w \). 4.05 -v +w ∈ (4.05 -1 +0,4.05 -0 +1)= (3.05,5.05). So integers4 or5.

So possible combinations:

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

So total 8 cases. Let&#x27;s check each.

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4, subtract the equations: (a -c) - (a +b)=4 -2 =&gt; -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But from b +c=5, contradiction. So invalid.

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=2 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; -(c + b)=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Similarly, a -c=5 and a +b=2. Subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

All cases lead to contradictions. Hence, there are no solutions. Therefore, the system of equations has no real solutions. Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98, \\
\lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05, \\
-\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01,
\end{cases}
\]
we start by expressing each variable in terms of its integer and fractional parts. Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), and \( \{x\} = u \), \( \{y\} = v \), \( \{z\} = w \), where \( a, b, c \) are integers and \( u, v, w \) are fractional parts such that \( 0 \leq u, v, w &lt; 1 \).

Substituting these into the equations, we get:
1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

We analyze the possible integer values for \( a + b \), \( b + c \), and \( a - c \):
- From equation 1, \( a + b \) must be 2 or 3.
- From equation 3, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6.
- From equation 2, \( a - c \) must be 4 or 5.

We check all possible combinations of these integer values and find that each leads to a contradiction. For example, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 results in:
\[
2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c = 1.97
\]
which is impossible since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. Similarly, other combinations also lead to contradictions.

Thus, the system of equations is inconsistent and has no real solutions. The number of real solutions is:
\[
\boxed{0}

Response: \boxed{2}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to solve this system of equations with floor functions and fractional parts. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:

1. \( x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( \lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
3. \( -\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01 \)

Hmm, floor functions and fractional parts. Remember, for any real number \( a \), \( a = \lfloor a \rfloor + \{a\} \), where \( \lfloor a \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( a \), and \( \{a\} \) is the fractional part, so \( 0 \leq \{a\} &lt; 1 \).

Let me denote:

Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), so \( \{x\} = x - a \), where \( a \) is integer and \( 0 \leq \{x\} &lt; 1 \).

Similarly, \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \{y\} = y - b \), with \( b \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{y\} &lt; 1 \).

And \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), \( \{z\} = z - c \), \( c \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So substituting these into the equations:

1. \( x + b - (z - c) = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( x + b - z + c = 2.98 \)
   Since \( x = a + \{x\} \), and \( z = c + \{z\} \), substitute these:
   \( (a + \{x\}) + b - (c + \{z\}) + c = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{x\} + b - c - \{z\} + c = 2.98 \)
   So \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
   
2. \( a + (y - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Since \( y = b + \{y\} \), substitute:
   \( a + (b + \{y\} - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
   Again, \( z = c + \{z\} \), so:
   \( a + \{y\} - (c + \{z\}) = 4.05 \)
   Which becomes: \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)

3. \( -\{x\} + y + c = 5.01 \)
   Substitute \( y = b + \{y\} \):
   \( -\{x\} + b + \{y\} + c = 5.01 \)
   So: \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

So now, the transformed equations are:

1. \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

Additionally, we have the original variables:

- \( x = a + \{x\} \)
- \( y = b + \{y\} \)
- \( z = c + \{z\} \)

With \( a, b, c \) integers, and \( 0 \leq \{x\}, \{y\}, \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So maybe I can set variables for the fractional parts:

Let me denote:

- \( \{x\} = u \), so \( 0 \leq u &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{y\} = v \), so \( 0 \leq v &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{z\} = w \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 1 \)

So equations become:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

And variables:

- \( x = a + u \)
- \( y = b + v \)
- \( z = c + w \)

Now, the problem is to find integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \in [0,1) \) such that these equations hold.

So maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) are integers, and \( u, w \) are fractions between 0 and 1, the right-hand side (RHS) is 2.98 + (w - u). Since \( w - u \) can be between -1 and 1 (since both are less than 1), so the RHS is between 2.98 - 1 ≈ 1.98 and 2.98 + 1 ≈ 3.98. Therefore, \( a + b \) must be an integer in that interval, so possible values of \( a + b \) are 2 or 3.

Similarly, equation 3: \( b + c = 5.01 - v + u \). The RHS is 5.01 + (u - v). Since \( u - v \) is between -1 and 1, the RHS is between 4.01 and 6.01. Therefore, \( b + c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values are 5 or 6.

Equation 2: \( a - c = 4.05 - v + w \). RHS is 4.05 + (w - v). Since \( w - v \in (-1,1) \), the RHS is between 3.05 and 5.05. Therefore, \( a - c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values 4 or 5.

So let&#x27;s note the possible integer values:

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2 \) or \( 3 \)

From equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \)

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \)

So we need to find integers \( a, b, c \) such that these combinations hold. Let&#x27;s list possible cases.

Case 1: \( a + b = 2 \)

Then, equation 1 gives \( 2 + u - w = 2.98 \), so \( u - w = 0.98 \). Since \( u, w \in [0,1) \), \( u = w + 0.98 \). But since \( u &lt; 1 \), \( w + 0.98 &lt; 1 \implies w &lt; 0.02 \). Similarly, \( w = u - 0.98 \geq 0 - 0.98 = -0.98 \), but \( w \geq 0 \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 0.02 \).

So \( w \in [0, 0.02) \), and \( u = w + 0.98 \in [0.98, 1.0) \). But \( u must be less than 1, so that&#x27;s okay.

Case 1, equation 1: \( u = w + 0.98 \), \( w \in [0, 0.02) \)

Now, proceed to equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \). Let&#x27;s suppose:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then from equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v \in [0,1) \), so \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u = w + 0.98 \), and \( w &lt; 0.02 \implies u &lt; 0.98 + 0.02 = 1.0 \), so actually \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \). So for \( v = u + 0.01 \), we need \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Therefore, combining with \( u \geq 0.98 \), \( u \in [0.98, 0.99) \), which implies \( w = u - 0.98 \in [0, 0.01) \), and \( v \in [0.99, 1.0) \). But \( v must be less than 1, so okay.

Alternatively, if \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v \geq 0 \implies u - 0.99 \geq 0 \implies u \geq 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \), so \( u \geq 0.99 \implies u \in [0.99, 1.0) \). Then \( v = u - 0.99 \in [0, 0.01) \). But \( u \in [0.99, 1.0) \), so \( v \in [0, 0.01) \).

So in Case 1, equation 3 can split into two subcases: \( b + c = 5 \) leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \), or \( b + c = 6 \) leading to \( v = u - 0.99 \).

Let me hold onto that and check equation 2.

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \).

But since in Case 1, \( a + b = 2 \), and equation 3 has \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), we can express \( a - c \) in terms of \( (a + b) - (b + c) + 2c \). Wait, maybe it&#x27;s better to relate variables.

Given \( a + b = 2 \), and \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), then:

If \( a + b = 2 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtracting the first from the second: \( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 2 \implies c - a = 3 \implies c = a + 3 \)

Similarly, if \( b + c = 6 \), then \( c - a = 6 - 2 = 4 \implies c = a + 4 \)

So equation 2 is \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \). But from above:

If \( c = a + 3 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 3) = -3 \), which is not 4 or 5. So that&#x27;s impossible.

If \( c = a + 4 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 4) = -4 \), which is also not 4 or 5. So in Case 1, regardless of \( b + c = 5 \) or 6, \( a - c \) is -3 or -4, which doesn&#x27;t match the possible equation 2 values (4 or 5). Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.

Thus, there are no solutions when \( a + b = 2 \).

Proceeding to Case 2: \( a + b = 3 \)

Then equation 1: \( 3 + u - w = 2.98 \implies u - w = -0.02 \implies u = w - 0.02 \)

But \( u \geq 0 \implies w - 0.02 \geq 0 \implies w \geq 0.02 \). Also, \( w &lt; 1 \implies u = w - 0.02 &lt; 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 \). So \( u \in [0, 0.98) \), and \( w = u + 0.02 \in [0.02, 1.0) \)

So equation 1 gives \( w = u + 0.02 \), \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), \( w ∈ [0.02, 1.0) \)

Now, equation 3: \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

Again, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6 (since the RHS is 5.01 + (u - v) which is between 4.01 and 6.01, as before). So similar to before:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v &lt; 1 \implies u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Which is already true because \( u &lt; 0.98 \). So \( v = u + 0.01 \), with \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), so \( v ∈ [0.01, 0.99) \)

If \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v ≥ 0 \implies u - 0.99 ≥ 0 \implies u ≥ 0.99 \). However, from equation 1, \( u &lt; 0.98 \), which conflicts. So this is impossible. Therefore, in Case 2, equation 3 must have \( b + c = 5 \), leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \)

So now, in Case 2, equations so far:

1. \( a + b = 3 \)
2. \( u = w - 0.02 \)
3. \( v = u + 0.01 = w - 0.02 + 0.01 = w - 0.01 \)
4. \( b + c = 5 \)
5. From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We can express \( a - c \). Since \( a + b = 3 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtract the first from the second:

\( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 3 \implies c - a = 2 \implies c = a + 2 \)

So substituting into equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

But \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - (a + 2) + v - w = -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so substituting:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = 6.05 \implies -0.01 = 6.05 \implies \)

This is impossible. Contradiction. So in Case 2, even with \( b + c =5 \), we end up with a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is impossible?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We have \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - c = -2 \)

Therefore, equation 2 becomes: \( -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = -0.01 = 6.05 \)

Which is not possible. Hence, contradiction. So even though we thought maybe Case 2 could work, the equations lead to a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is also impossible?

Wait, but both cases lead to contradictions. That can&#x27;t be. Then there are no solutions? But the problem states &quot;determine the number of real solutions&quot;, so maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple possibilities for \( a, b, c \). Wait, in Case 2, we have \( a + b = 3 \), \( b + c =5 \), so \( c = a + 2 \). Then in equation 2, substituting \( a - c = -2 \), and \( v - w \), but \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). Then equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = 4.05 \implies -2.01 =4.05 \), which is false. So that&#x27;s impossible.

But maybe I made a wrong assumption when I split the equations. Let me check again.

Wait, equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \). From Case 2:

We have \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). And \( a - c = -2 \). Therefore, equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = -2.01 \), which is not equal to 4.05. So indeed, no solution here.

Hmm. So both cases when \( a + b = 2 \) and \( 3 \) lead to contradictions. Therefore, does that mean there are no solutions? But the problem is from a competition, so it&#x27;s unlikely to have no solutions. Maybe I made a wrong approach.

Wait, let me check again the equations after substitution.

Original equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Variables:

- \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z} \)
- \( u, v, w ∈ [0,1) \)

Perhaps I need to solve these three equations for integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \).

Let me try to write these equations as linear equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to combine the equations to eliminate some variables.

First, add equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w = 7.99 \)

But equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Let me subtract equation 2 from the sum:

Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99 \)
Minus equation 2: \( (a - c + v - w) =4.05 \)
Result: \( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)
Simplify: \( 2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c =1.97 \)

But \( b + c \) must be integer since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. But 1.97 is not an integer. Contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that the system is inconsistent? But that can&#x27;t be. Wait, so even if we assume that the equations hold, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 leads to a non-integer sum, which contradicts that \( b + c \) must be integer. Therefore, there are no solutions?

But this is strange. Let me verify my steps again.

Adding equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =2.98 +5.01 =7.99 \)

Equation 2: \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Subtracting equation 2 from the sum:

\( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 2b + 2c =3.94 \implies b +c =1.97 \)

But since \( b, c \) are integers, \( b +c \) must be integer, but 1.97 is not. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, the system has no solution.

Therefore, the number of real solutions is zero.

But wait, this seems to be the case. But let me check if I added the equations correctly.

Equation 1: a + b + u - w =2.98

Equation 3: b + c + v - u =5.01

Sum: a + b + u - w + b + c + v - u =2.98 +5.01

Simplifies to: a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99

Equation 2: a - c + v - w =4.05

Subtract equation 2: (a +2b + c + v -w) - (a -c +v -w) =7.99 -4.05

Left side: a +2b +c +v -w -a +c -v +w =2b +2c

Right side:3.94

Thus, 2b +2c=3.94 =&gt; b +c=1.97, which is impossible because b and c are integers. Therefore, the system is inconsistent, no solutions.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check again for possible miscalculations.

Wait, the problem says &quot;real solutions&quot;, but in the equations, floor and fractional parts are involved, so variables x, y, z are real numbers, but with their floor and fractional parts.

But according to the above, the equations lead to a contradiction, so there&#x27;s no solution.

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the thought process. Let me check with different approaches.

Suppose I take equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w =2.98 \)

2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to express variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b =2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) integers, 2.98 -u +w must be integer. Since u, w are fractional parts, 0 ≤ u, w &lt;1, so 2.98 - u + w ∈ (2.98 -1 +0, 2.98 -0 +1) = (1.98, 3.98). Thus, possible integer values 2 or3.

Similarly, from equation3: \( b +c =5.01 -v +u \). 5.01 -v +u ∈ (5.01 -1 +0, 5.01 -0 +1)= (4.01,6.01). So integers 5 or6.

From equation2: \( a -c =4.05 -v +w \). 4.05 -v +w ∈ (4.05 -1 +0,4.05 -0 +1)= (3.05,5.05). So integers4 or5.

So possible combinations:

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

So total 8 cases. Let&#x27;s check each.

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4, subtract the equations: (a -c) - (a +b)=4 -2 =&gt; -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But from b +c=5, contradiction. So invalid.

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=2 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; -(c + b)=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Similarly, a -c=5 and a +b=2. Subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

All cases lead to contradictions. Hence, there are no solutions. Therefore, the system of equations has no real solutions. Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98, \\
\lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05, \\
-\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01,
\end{cases}
\]
we start by expressing each variable in terms of its integer and fractional parts. Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), and \( \{x\} = u \), \( \{y\} = v \), \( \{z\} = w \), where \( a, b, c \) are integers and \( u, v, w \) are fractional parts such that \( 0 \leq u, v, w &lt; 1 \).

Substituting these into the equations, we get:
1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

We analyze the possible integer values for \( a + b \), \( b + c \), and \( a - c \):
- From equation 1, \( a + b \) must be 2 or 3.
- From equation 3, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6.
- From equation 2, \( a - c \) must be 4 or 5.

We check all possible combinations of these integer values and find that each leads to a contradiction. For example, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 results in:
\[
2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c = 1.97
\]
which is impossible since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. Similarly, other combinations also lead to contradictions.

Thus, the system of equations is inconsistent and has no real solutions. The number of real solutions is:
\[
\boxed{0}

Response: \boxed{2}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to solve this system of equations with floor functions and fractional parts. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:

1. \( x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( \lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
3. \( -\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01 \)

Hmm, floor functions and fractional parts. Remember, for any real number \( a \), \( a = \lfloor a \rfloor + \{a\} \), where \( \lfloor a \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( a \), and \( \{a\} \) is the fractional part, so \( 0 \leq \{a\} &lt; 1 \).

Let me denote:

Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), so \( \{x\} = x - a \), where \( a \) is integer and \( 0 \leq \{x\} &lt; 1 \).

Similarly, \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \{y\} = y - b \), with \( b \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{y\} &lt; 1 \).

And \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), \( \{z\} = z - c \), \( c \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So substituting these into the equations:

1. \( x + b - (z - c) = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( x + b - z + c = 2.98 \)
   Since \( x = a + \{x\} \), and \( z = c + \{z\} \), substitute these:
   \( (a + \{x\}) + b - (c + \{z\}) + c = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{x\} + b - c - \{z\} + c = 2.98 \)
   So \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
   
2. \( a + (y - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Since \( y = b + \{y\} \), substitute:
   \( a + (b + \{y\} - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
   Again, \( z = c + \{z\} \), so:
   \( a + \{y\} - (c + \{z\}) = 4.05 \)
   Which becomes: \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)

3. \( -\{x\} + y + c = 5.01 \)
   Substitute \( y = b + \{y\} \):
   \( -\{x\} + b + \{y\} + c = 5.01 \)
   So: \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

So now, the transformed equations are:

1. \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

Additionally, we have the original variables:

- \( x = a + \{x\} \)
- \( y = b + \{y\} \)
- \( z = c + \{z\} \)

With \( a, b, c \) integers, and \( 0 \leq \{x\}, \{y\}, \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So maybe I can set variables for the fractional parts:

Let me denote:

- \( \{x\} = u \), so \( 0 \leq u &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{y\} = v \), so \( 0 \leq v &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{z\} = w \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 1 \)

So equations become:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

And variables:

- \( x = a + u \)
- \( y = b + v \)
- \( z = c + w \)

Now, the problem is to find integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \in [0,1) \) such that these equations hold.

So maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) are integers, and \( u, w \) are fractions between 0 and 1, the right-hand side (RHS) is 2.98 + (w - u). Since \( w - u \) can be between -1 and 1 (since both are less than 1), so the RHS is between 2.98 - 1 ≈ 1.98 and 2.98 + 1 ≈ 3.98. Therefore, \( a + b \) must be an integer in that interval, so possible values of \( a + b \) are 2 or 3.

Similarly, equation 3: \( b + c = 5.01 - v + u \). The RHS is 5.01 + (u - v). Since \( u - v \) is between -1 and 1, the RHS is between 4.01 and 6.01. Therefore, \( b + c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values are 5 or 6.

Equation 2: \( a - c = 4.05 - v + w \). RHS is 4.05 + (w - v). Since \( w - v \in (-1,1) \), the RHS is between 3.05 and 5.05. Therefore, \( a - c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values 4 or 5.

So let&#x27;s note the possible integer values:

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2 \) or \( 3 \)

From equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \)

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \)

So we need to find integers \( a, b, c \) such that these combinations hold. Let&#x27;s list possible cases.

Case 1: \( a + b = 2 \)

Then, equation 1 gives \( 2 + u - w = 2.98 \), so \( u - w = 0.98 \). Since \( u, w \in [0,1) \), \( u = w + 0.98 \). But since \( u &lt; 1 \), \( w + 0.98 &lt; 1 \implies w &lt; 0.02 \). Similarly, \( w = u - 0.98 \geq 0 - 0.98 = -0.98 \), but \( w \geq 0 \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 0.02 \).

So \( w \in [0, 0.02) \), and \( u = w + 0.98 \in [0.98, 1.0) \). But \( u must be less than 1, so that&#x27;s okay.

Case 1, equation 1: \( u = w + 0.98 \), \( w \in [0, 0.02) \)

Now, proceed to equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \). Let&#x27;s suppose:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then from equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v \in [0,1) \), so \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u = w + 0.98 \), and \( w &lt; 0.02 \implies u &lt; 0.98 + 0.02 = 1.0 \), so actually \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \). So for \( v = u + 0.01 \), we need \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Therefore, combining with \( u \geq 0.98 \), \( u \in [0.98, 0.99) \), which implies \( w = u - 0.98 \in [0, 0.01) \), and \( v \in [0.99, 1.0) \). But \( v must be less than 1, so okay.

Alternatively, if \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v \geq 0 \implies u - 0.99 \geq 0 \implies u \geq 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \), so \( u \geq 0.99 \implies u \in [0.99, 1.0) \). Then \( v = u - 0.99 \in [0, 0.01) \). But \( u \in [0.99, 1.0) \), so \( v \in [0, 0.01) \).

So in Case 1, equation 3 can split into two subcases: \( b + c = 5 \) leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \), or \( b + c = 6 \) leading to \( v = u - 0.99 \).

Let me hold onto that and check equation 2.

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \).

But since in Case 1, \( a + b = 2 \), and equation 3 has \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), we can express \( a - c \) in terms of \( (a + b) - (b + c) + 2c \). Wait, maybe it&#x27;s better to relate variables.

Given \( a + b = 2 \), and \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), then:

If \( a + b = 2 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtracting the first from the second: \( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 2 \implies c - a = 3 \implies c = a + 3 \)

Similarly, if \( b + c = 6 \), then \( c - a = 6 - 2 = 4 \implies c = a + 4 \)

So equation 2 is \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \). But from above:

If \( c = a + 3 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 3) = -3 \), which is not 4 or 5. So that&#x27;s impossible.

If \( c = a + 4 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 4) = -4 \), which is also not 4 or 5. So in Case 1, regardless of \( b + c = 5 \) or 6, \( a - c \) is -3 or -4, which doesn&#x27;t match the possible equation 2 values (4 or 5). Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.

Thus, there are no solutions when \( a + b = 2 \).

Proceeding to Case 2: \( a + b = 3 \)

Then equation 1: \( 3 + u - w = 2.98 \implies u - w = -0.02 \implies u = w - 0.02 \)

But \( u \geq 0 \implies w - 0.02 \geq 0 \implies w \geq 0.02 \). Also, \( w &lt; 1 \implies u = w - 0.02 &lt; 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 \). So \( u \in [0, 0.98) \), and \( w = u + 0.02 \in [0.02, 1.0) \)

So equation 1 gives \( w = u + 0.02 \), \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), \( w ∈ [0.02, 1.0) \)

Now, equation 3: \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

Again, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6 (since the RHS is 5.01 + (u - v) which is between 4.01 and 6.01, as before). So similar to before:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v &lt; 1 \implies u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Which is already true because \( u &lt; 0.98 \). So \( v = u + 0.01 \), with \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), so \( v ∈ [0.01, 0.99) \)

If \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v ≥ 0 \implies u - 0.99 ≥ 0 \implies u ≥ 0.99 \). However, from equation 1, \( u &lt; 0.98 \), which conflicts. So this is impossible. Therefore, in Case 2, equation 3 must have \( b + c = 5 \), leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \)

So now, in Case 2, equations so far:

1. \( a + b = 3 \)
2. \( u = w - 0.02 \)
3. \( v = u + 0.01 = w - 0.02 + 0.01 = w - 0.01 \)
4. \( b + c = 5 \)
5. From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We can express \( a - c \). Since \( a + b = 3 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtract the first from the second:

\( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 3 \implies c - a = 2 \implies c = a + 2 \)

So substituting into equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

But \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - (a + 2) + v - w = -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so substituting:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = 6.05 \implies -0.01 = 6.05 \implies \)

This is impossible. Contradiction. So in Case 2, even with \( b + c =5 \), we end up with a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is impossible?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We have \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - c = -2 \)

Therefore, equation 2 becomes: \( -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = -0.01 = 6.05 \)

Which is not possible. Hence, contradiction. So even though we thought maybe Case 2 could work, the equations lead to a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is also impossible?

Wait, but both cases lead to contradictions. That can&#x27;t be. Then there are no solutions? But the problem states &quot;determine the number of real solutions&quot;, so maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple possibilities for \( a, b, c \). Wait, in Case 2, we have \( a + b = 3 \), \( b + c =5 \), so \( c = a + 2 \). Then in equation 2, substituting \( a - c = -2 \), and \( v - w \), but \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). Then equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = 4.05 \implies -2.01 =4.05 \), which is false. So that&#x27;s impossible.

But maybe I made a wrong assumption when I split the equations. Let me check again.

Wait, equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \). From Case 2:

We have \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). And \( a - c = -2 \). Therefore, equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = -2.01 \), which is not equal to 4.05. So indeed, no solution here.

Hmm. So both cases when \( a + b = 2 \) and \( 3 \) lead to contradictions. Therefore, does that mean there are no solutions? But the problem is from a competition, so it&#x27;s unlikely to have no solutions. Maybe I made a wrong approach.

Wait, let me check again the equations after substitution.

Original equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Variables:

- \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z} \)
- \( u, v, w ∈ [0,1) \)

Perhaps I need to solve these three equations for integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \).

Let me try to write these equations as linear equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to combine the equations to eliminate some variables.

First, add equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w = 7.99 \)

But equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Let me subtract equation 2 from the sum:

Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99 \)
Minus equation 2: \( (a - c + v - w) =4.05 \)
Result: \( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)
Simplify: \( 2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c =1.97 \)

But \( b + c \) must be integer since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. But 1.97 is not an integer. Contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that the system is inconsistent? But that can&#x27;t be. Wait, so even if we assume that the equations hold, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 leads to a non-integer sum, which contradicts that \( b + c \) must be integer. Therefore, there are no solutions?

But this is strange. Let me verify my steps again.

Adding equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =2.98 +5.01 =7.99 \)

Equation 2: \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Subtracting equation 2 from the sum:

\( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 2b + 2c =3.94 \implies b +c =1.97 \)

But since \( b, c \) are integers, \( b +c \) must be integer, but 1.97 is not. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, the system has no solution.

Therefore, the number of real solutions is zero.

But wait, this seems to be the case. But let me check if I added the equations correctly.

Equation 1: a + b + u - w =2.98

Equation 3: b + c + v - u =5.01

Sum: a + b + u - w + b + c + v - u =2.98 +5.01

Simplifies to: a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99

Equation 2: a - c + v - w =4.05

Subtract equation 2: (a +2b + c + v -w) - (a -c +v -w) =7.99 -4.05

Left side: a +2b +c +v -w -a +c -v +w =2b +2c

Right side:3.94

Thus, 2b +2c=3.94 =&gt; b +c=1.97, which is impossible because b and c are integers. Therefore, the system is inconsistent, no solutions.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check again for possible miscalculations.

Wait, the problem says &quot;real solutions&quot;, but in the equations, floor and fractional parts are involved, so variables x, y, z are real numbers, but with their floor and fractional parts.

But according to the above, the equations lead to a contradiction, so there&#x27;s no solution.

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the thought process. Let me check with different approaches.

Suppose I take equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w =2.98 \)

2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to express variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b =2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) integers, 2.98 -u +w must be integer. Since u, w are fractional parts, 0 ≤ u, w &lt;1, so 2.98 - u + w ∈ (2.98 -1 +0, 2.98 -0 +1) = (1.98, 3.98). Thus, possible integer values 2 or3.

Similarly, from equation3: \( b +c =5.01 -v +u \). 5.01 -v +u ∈ (5.01 -1 +0, 5.01 -0 +1)= (4.01,6.01). So integers 5 or6.

From equation2: \( a -c =4.05 -v +w \). 4.05 -v +w ∈ (4.05 -1 +0,4.05 -0 +1)= (3.05,5.05). So integers4 or5.

So possible combinations:

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

So total 8 cases. Let&#x27;s check each.

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4, subtract the equations: (a -c) - (a +b)=4 -2 =&gt; -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But from b +c=5, contradiction. So invalid.

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=2 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; -(c + b)=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Similarly, a -c=5 and a +b=2. Subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

All cases lead to contradictions. Hence, there are no solutions. Therefore, the system of equations has no real solutions. Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98, \\
\lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05, \\
-\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01,
\end{cases}
\]
we start by expressing each variable in terms of its integer and fractional parts. Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), and \( \{x\} = u \), \( \{y\} = v \), \( \{z\} = w \), where \( a, b, c \) are integers and \( u, v, w \) are fractional parts such that \( 0 \leq u, v, w &lt; 1 \).

Substituting these into the equations, we get:
1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

We analyze the possible integer values for \( a + b \), \( b + c \), and \( a - c \):
- From equation 1, \( a + b \) must be 2 or 3.
- From equation 3, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6.
- From equation 2, \( a - c \) must be 4 or 5.

We check all possible combinations of these integer values and find that each leads to a contradiction. For example, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 results in:
\[
2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c = 1.97
\]
which is impossible since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. Similarly, other combinations also lead to contradictions.

Thus, the system of equations is inconsistent and has no real solutions. The number of real solutions is:
\[

Response: \boxed{3}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to solve this system of equations with floor functions and fractional parts. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:

1. \( x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( \lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
3. \( -\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01 \)

Hmm, floor functions and fractional parts. Remember, for any real number \( a \), \( a = \lfloor a \rfloor + \{a\} \), where \( \lfloor a \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( a \), and \( \{a\} \) is the fractional part, so \( 0 \leq \{a\} &lt; 1 \).

Let me denote:

Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), so \( \{x\} = x - a \), where \( a \) is integer and \( 0 \leq \{x\} &lt; 1 \).

Similarly, \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \{y\} = y - b \), with \( b \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{y\} &lt; 1 \).

And \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), \( \{z\} = z - c \), \( c \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So substituting these into the equations:

1. \( x + b - (z - c) = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( x + b - z + c = 2.98 \)
   Since \( x = a + \{x\} \), and \( z = c + \{z\} \), substitute these:
   \( (a + \{x\}) + b - (c + \{z\}) + c = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{x\} + b - c - \{z\} + c = 2.98 \)
   So \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
   
2. \( a + (y - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Since \( y = b + \{y\} \), substitute:
   \( a + (b + \{y\} - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
   Again, \( z = c + \{z\} \), so:
   \( a + \{y\} - (c + \{z\}) = 4.05 \)
   Which becomes: \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)

3. \( -\{x\} + y + c = 5.01 \)
   Substitute \( y = b + \{y\} \):
   \( -\{x\} + b + \{y\} + c = 5.01 \)
   So: \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

So now, the transformed equations are:

1. \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

Additionally, we have the original variables:

- \( x = a + \{x\} \)
- \( y = b + \{y\} \)
- \( z = c + \{z\} \)

With \( a, b, c \) integers, and \( 0 \leq \{x\}, \{y\}, \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So maybe I can set variables for the fractional parts:

Let me denote:

- \( \{x\} = u \), so \( 0 \leq u &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{y\} = v \), so \( 0 \leq v &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{z\} = w \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 1 \)

So equations become:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

And variables:

- \( x = a + u \)
- \( y = b + v \)
- \( z = c + w \)

Now, the problem is to find integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \in [0,1) \) such that these equations hold.

So maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) are integers, and \( u, w \) are fractions between 0 and 1, the right-hand side (RHS) is 2.98 + (w - u). Since \( w - u \) can be between -1 and 1 (since both are less than 1), so the RHS is between 2.98 - 1 ≈ 1.98 and 2.98 + 1 ≈ 3.98. Therefore, \( a + b \) must be an integer in that interval, so possible values of \( a + b \) are 2 or 3.

Similarly, equation 3: \( b + c = 5.01 - v + u \). The RHS is 5.01 + (u - v). Since \( u - v \) is between -1 and 1, the RHS is between 4.01 and 6.01. Therefore, \( b + c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values are 5 or 6.

Equation 2: \( a - c = 4.05 - v + w \). RHS is 4.05 + (w - v). Since \( w - v \in (-1,1) \), the RHS is between 3.05 and 5.05. Therefore, \( a - c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values 4 or 5.

So let&#x27;s note the possible integer values:

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2 \) or \( 3 \)

From equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \)

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \)

So we need to find integers \( a, b, c \) such that these combinations hold. Let&#x27;s list possible cases.

Case 1: \( a + b = 2 \)

Then, equation 1 gives \( 2 + u - w = 2.98 \), so \( u - w = 0.98 \). Since \( u, w \in [0,1) \), \( u = w + 0.98 \). But since \( u &lt; 1 \), \( w + 0.98 &lt; 1 \implies w &lt; 0.02 \). Similarly, \( w = u - 0.98 \geq 0 - 0.98 = -0.98 \), but \( w \geq 0 \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 0.02 \).

So \( w \in [0, 0.02) \), and \( u = w + 0.98 \in [0.98, 1.0) \). But \( u must be less than 1, so that&#x27;s okay.

Case 1, equation 1: \( u = w + 0.98 \), \( w \in [0, 0.02) \)

Now, proceed to equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \). Let&#x27;s suppose:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then from equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v \in [0,1) \), so \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u = w + 0.98 \), and \( w &lt; 0.02 \implies u &lt; 0.98 + 0.02 = 1.0 \), so actually \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \). So for \( v = u + 0.01 \), we need \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Therefore, combining with \( u \geq 0.98 \), \( u \in [0.98, 0.99) \), which implies \( w = u - 0.98 \in [0, 0.01) \), and \( v \in [0.99, 1.0) \). But \( v must be less than 1, so okay.

Alternatively, if \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v \geq 0 \implies u - 0.99 \geq 0 \implies u \geq 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \), so \( u \geq 0.99 \implies u \in [0.99, 1.0) \). Then \( v = u - 0.99 \in [0, 0.01) \). But \( u \in [0.99, 1.0) \), so \( v \in [0, 0.01) \).

So in Case 1, equation 3 can split into two subcases: \( b + c = 5 \) leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \), or \( b + c = 6 \) leading to \( v = u - 0.99 \).

Let me hold onto that and check equation 2.

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \).

But since in Case 1, \( a + b = 2 \), and equation 3 has \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), we can express \( a - c \) in terms of \( (a + b) - (b + c) + 2c \). Wait, maybe it&#x27;s better to relate variables.

Given \( a + b = 2 \), and \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), then:

If \( a + b = 2 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtracting the first from the second: \( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 2 \implies c - a = 3 \implies c = a + 3 \)

Similarly, if \( b + c = 6 \), then \( c - a = 6 - 2 = 4 \implies c = a + 4 \)

So equation 2 is \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \). But from above:

If \( c = a + 3 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 3) = -3 \), which is not 4 or 5. So that&#x27;s impossible.

If \( c = a + 4 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 4) = -4 \), which is also not 4 or 5. So in Case 1, regardless of \( b + c = 5 \) or 6, \( a - c \) is -3 or -4, which doesn&#x27;t match the possible equation 2 values (4 or 5). Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.

Thus, there are no solutions when \( a + b = 2 \).

Proceeding to Case 2: \( a + b = 3 \)

Then equation 1: \( 3 + u - w = 2.98 \implies u - w = -0.02 \implies u = w - 0.02 \)

But \( u \geq 0 \implies w - 0.02 \geq 0 \implies w \geq 0.02 \). Also, \( w &lt; 1 \implies u = w - 0.02 &lt; 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 \). So \( u \in [0, 0.98) \), and \( w = u + 0.02 \in [0.02, 1.0) \)

So equation 1 gives \( w = u + 0.02 \), \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), \( w ∈ [0.02, 1.0) \)

Now, equation 3: \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

Again, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6 (since the RHS is 5.01 + (u - v) which is between 4.01 and 6.01, as before). So similar to before:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v &lt; 1 \implies u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Which is already true because \( u &lt; 0.98 \). So \( v = u + 0.01 \), with \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), so \( v ∈ [0.01, 0.99) \)

If \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v ≥ 0 \implies u - 0.99 ≥ 0 \implies u ≥ 0.99 \). However, from equation 1, \( u &lt; 0.98 \), which conflicts. So this is impossible. Therefore, in Case 2, equation 3 must have \( b + c = 5 \), leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \)

So now, in Case 2, equations so far:

1. \( a + b = 3 \)
2. \( u = w - 0.02 \)
3. \( v = u + 0.01 = w - 0.02 + 0.01 = w - 0.01 \)
4. \( b + c = 5 \)
5. From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We can express \( a - c \). Since \( a + b = 3 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtract the first from the second:

\( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 3 \implies c - a = 2 \implies c = a + 2 \)

So substituting into equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

But \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - (a + 2) + v - w = -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so substituting:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = 6.05 \implies -0.01 = 6.05 \implies \)

This is impossible. Contradiction. So in Case 2, even with \( b + c =5 \), we end up with a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is impossible?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We have \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - c = -2 \)

Therefore, equation 2 becomes: \( -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = -0.01 = 6.05 \)

Which is not possible. Hence, contradiction. So even though we thought maybe Case 2 could work, the equations lead to a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is also impossible?

Wait, but both cases lead to contradictions. That can&#x27;t be. Then there are no solutions? But the problem states &quot;determine the number of real solutions&quot;, so maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple possibilities for \( a, b, c \). Wait, in Case 2, we have \( a + b = 3 \), \( b + c =5 \), so \( c = a + 2 \). Then in equation 2, substituting \( a - c = -2 \), and \( v - w \), but \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). Then equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = 4.05 \implies -2.01 =4.05 \), which is false. So that&#x27;s impossible.

But maybe I made a wrong assumption when I split the equations. Let me check again.

Wait, equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \). From Case 2:

We have \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). And \( a - c = -2 \). Therefore, equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = -2.01 \), which is not equal to 4.05. So indeed, no solution here.

Hmm. So both cases when \( a + b = 2 \) and \( 3 \) lead to contradictions. Therefore, does that mean there are no solutions? But the problem is from a competition, so it&#x27;s unlikely to have no solutions. Maybe I made a wrong approach.

Wait, let me check again the equations after substitution.

Original equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Variables:

- \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z} \)
- \( u, v, w ∈ [0,1) \)

Perhaps I need to solve these three equations for integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \).

Let me try to write these equations as linear equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to combine the equations to eliminate some variables.

First, add equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w = 7.99 \)

But equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Let me subtract equation 2 from the sum:

Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99 \)
Minus equation 2: \( (a - c + v - w) =4.05 \)
Result: \( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)
Simplify: \( 2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c =1.97 \)

But \( b + c \) must be integer since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. But 1.97 is not an integer. Contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that the system is inconsistent? But that can&#x27;t be. Wait, so even if we assume that the equations hold, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 leads to a non-integer sum, which contradicts that \( b + c \) must be integer. Therefore, there are no solutions?

But this is strange. Let me verify my steps again.

Adding equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =2.98 +5.01 =7.99 \)

Equation 2: \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Subtracting equation 2 from the sum:

\( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 2b + 2c =3.94 \implies b +c =1.97 \)

But since \( b, c \) are integers, \( b +c \) must be integer, but 1.97 is not. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, the system has no solution.

Therefore, the number of real solutions is zero.

But wait, this seems to be the case. But let me check if I added the equations correctly.

Equation 1: a + b + u - w =2.98

Equation 3: b + c + v - u =5.01

Sum: a + b + u - w + b + c + v - u =2.98 +5.01

Simplifies to: a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99

Equation 2: a - c + v - w =4.05

Subtract equation 2: (a +2b + c + v -w) - (a -c +v -w) =7.99 -4.05

Left side: a +2b +c +v -w -a +c -v +w =2b +2c

Right side:3.94

Thus, 2b +2c=3.94 =&gt; b +c=1.97, which is impossible because b and c are integers. Therefore, the system is inconsistent, no solutions.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check again for possible miscalculations.

Wait, the problem says &quot;real solutions&quot;, but in the equations, floor and fractional parts are involved, so variables x, y, z are real numbers, but with their floor and fractional parts.

But according to the above, the equations lead to a contradiction, so there&#x27;s no solution.

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the thought process. Let me check with different approaches.

Suppose I take equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w =2.98 \)

2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to express variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b =2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) integers, 2.98 -u +w must be integer. Since u, w are fractional parts, 0 ≤ u, w &lt;1, so 2.98 - u + w ∈ (2.98 -1 +0, 2.98 -0 +1) = (1.98, 3.98). Thus, possible integer values 2 or3.

Similarly, from equation3: \( b +c =5.01 -v +u \). 5.01 -v +u ∈ (5.01 -1 +0, 5.01 -0 +1)= (4.01,6.01). So integers 5 or6.

From equation2: \( a -c =4.05 -v +w \). 4.05 -v +w ∈ (4.05 -1 +0,4.05 -0 +1)= (3.05,5.05). So integers4 or5.

So possible combinations:

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

So total 8 cases. Let&#x27;s check each.

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4, subtract the equations: (a -c) - (a +b)=4 -2 =&gt; -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But from b +c=5, contradiction. So invalid.

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=2 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; -(c + b)=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Similarly, a -c=5 and a +b=2. Subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

All cases lead to contradictions. Hence, there are no solutions. Therefore, the system of equations has no real solutions. Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98, \\
\lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05, \\
-\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01,
\end{cases}
\]
we start by expressing each variable in terms of its integer and fractional parts. Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), and \( \{x\} = u \), \( \{y\} = v \), \( \{z\} = w \), where \( a, b, c \) are integers and \( u, v, w \) are fractional parts such that \( 0 \leq u, v, w &lt; 1 \).

Substituting these into the equations, we get:
1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

We analyze the possible integer values for \( a + b \), \( b + c \), and \( a - c \):
- From equation 1, \( a + b \) must be 2 or 3.
- From equation 3, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6.
- From equation 2, \( a - c \) must be 4 or 5.

We check all possible combinations of these integer values and find that each leads to a contradiction. For example, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 results in:
\[
2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c = 1.97
\]
which is impossible since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. Similarly, other combinations also lead to contradictions.

Thus, the system of equations is inconsistent and has no real solutions. The number of real solutions is:
\[

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to solve this system of equations with floor functions and fractional parts. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:

1. \( x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( \lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
3. \( -\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01 \)

Hmm, floor functions and fractional parts. Remember, for any real number \( a \), \( a = \lfloor a \rfloor + \{a\} \), where \( \lfloor a \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( a \), and \( \{a\} \) is the fractional part, so \( 0 \leq \{a\} &lt; 1 \).

Let me denote:

Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), so \( \{x\} = x - a \), where \( a \) is integer and \( 0 \leq \{x\} &lt; 1 \).

Similarly, \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \{y\} = y - b \), with \( b \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{y\} &lt; 1 \).

And \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), \( \{z\} = z - c \), \( c \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So substituting these into the equations:

1. \( x + b - (z - c) = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( x + b - z + c = 2.98 \)
   Since \( x = a + \{x\} \), and \( z = c + \{z\} \), substitute these:
   \( (a + \{x\}) + b - (c + \{z\}) + c = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{x\} + b - c - \{z\} + c = 2.98 \)
   So \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
   
2. \( a + (y - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Since \( y = b + \{y\} \), substitute:
   \( a + (b + \{y\} - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
   Again, \( z = c + \{z\} \), so:
   \( a + \{y\} - (c + \{z\}) = 4.05 \)
   Which becomes: \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)

3. \( -\{x\} + y + c = 5.01 \)
   Substitute \( y = b + \{y\} \):
   \( -\{x\} + b + \{y\} + c = 5.01 \)
   So: \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

So now, the transformed equations are:

1. \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

Additionally, we have the original variables:

- \( x = a + \{x\} \)
- \( y = b + \{y\} \)
- \( z = c + \{z\} \)

With \( a, b, c \) integers, and \( 0 \leq \{x\}, \{y\}, \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So maybe I can set variables for the fractional parts:

Let me denote:

- \( \{x\} = u \), so \( 0 \leq u &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{y\} = v \), so \( 0 \leq v &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{z\} = w \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 1 \)

So equations become:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

And variables:

- \( x = a + u \)
- \( y = b + v \)
- \( z = c + w \)

Now, the problem is to find integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \in [0,1) \) such that these equations hold.

So maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) are integers, and \( u, w \) are fractions between 0 and 1, the right-hand side (RHS) is 2.98 + (w - u). Since \( w - u \) can be between -1 and 1 (since both are less than 1), so the RHS is between 2.98 - 1 ≈ 1.98 and 2.98 + 1 ≈ 3.98. Therefore, \( a + b \) must be an integer in that interval, so possible values of \( a + b \) are 2 or 3.

Similarly, equation 3: \( b + c = 5.01 - v + u \). The RHS is 5.01 + (u - v). Since \( u - v \) is between -1 and 1, the RHS is between 4.01 and 6.01. Therefore, \( b + c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values are 5 or 6.

Equation 2: \( a - c = 4.05 - v + w \). RHS is 4.05 + (w - v). Since \( w - v \in (-1,1) \), the RHS is between 3.05 and 5.05. Therefore, \( a - c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values 4 or 5.

So let&#x27;s note the possible integer values:

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2 \) or \( 3 \)

From equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \)

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \)

So we need to find integers \( a, b, c \) such that these combinations hold. Let&#x27;s list possible cases.

Case 1: \( a + b = 2 \)

Then, equation 1 gives \( 2 + u - w = 2.98 \), so \( u - w = 0.98 \). Since \( u, w \in [0,1) \), \( u = w + 0.98 \). But since \( u &lt; 1 \), \( w + 0.98 &lt; 1 \implies w &lt; 0.02 \). Similarly, \( w = u - 0.98 \geq 0 - 0.98 = -0.98 \), but \( w \geq 0 \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 0.02 \).

So \( w \in [0, 0.02) \), and \( u = w + 0.98 \in [0.98, 1.0) \). But \( u must be less than 1, so that&#x27;s okay.

Case 1, equation 1: \( u = w + 0.98 \), \( w \in [0, 0.02) \)

Now, proceed to equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \). Let&#x27;s suppose:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then from equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v \in [0,1) \), so \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u = w + 0.98 \), and \( w &lt; 0.02 \implies u &lt; 0.98 + 0.02 = 1.0 \), so actually \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \). So for \( v = u + 0.01 \), we need \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Therefore, combining with \( u \geq 0.98 \), \( u \in [0.98, 0.99) \), which implies \( w = u - 0.98 \in [0, 0.01) \), and \( v \in [0.99, 1.0) \). But \( v must be less than 1, so okay.

Alternatively, if \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v \geq 0 \implies u - 0.99 \geq 0 \implies u \geq 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \), so \( u \geq 0.99 \implies u \in [0.99, 1.0) \). Then \( v = u - 0.99 \in [0, 0.01) \). But \( u \in [0.99, 1.0) \), so \( v \in [0, 0.01) \).

So in Case 1, equation 3 can split into two subcases: \( b + c = 5 \) leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \), or \( b + c = 6 \) leading to \( v = u - 0.99 \).

Let me hold onto that and check equation 2.

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \).

But since in Case 1, \( a + b = 2 \), and equation 3 has \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), we can express \( a - c \) in terms of \( (a + b) - (b + c) + 2c \). Wait, maybe it&#x27;s better to relate variables.

Given \( a + b = 2 \), and \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), then:

If \( a + b = 2 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtracting the first from the second: \( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 2 \implies c - a = 3 \implies c = a + 3 \)

Similarly, if \( b + c = 6 \), then \( c - a = 6 - 2 = 4 \implies c = a + 4 \)

So equation 2 is \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \). But from above:

If \( c = a + 3 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 3) = -3 \), which is not 4 or 5. So that&#x27;s impossible.

If \( c = a + 4 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 4) = -4 \), which is also not 4 or 5. So in Case 1, regardless of \( b + c = 5 \) or 6, \( a - c \) is -3 or -4, which doesn&#x27;t match the possible equation 2 values (4 or 5). Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.

Thus, there are no solutions when \( a + b = 2 \).

Proceeding to Case 2: \( a + b = 3 \)

Then equation 1: \( 3 + u - w = 2.98 \implies u - w = -0.02 \implies u = w - 0.02 \)

But \( u \geq 0 \implies w - 0.02 \geq 0 \implies w \geq 0.02 \). Also, \( w &lt; 1 \implies u = w - 0.02 &lt; 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 \). So \( u \in [0, 0.98) \), and \( w = u + 0.02 \in [0.02, 1.0) \)

So equation 1 gives \( w = u + 0.02 \), \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), \( w ∈ [0.02, 1.0) \)

Now, equation 3: \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

Again, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6 (since the RHS is 5.01 + (u - v) which is between 4.01 and 6.01, as before). So similar to before:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v &lt; 1 \implies u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Which is already true because \( u &lt; 0.98 \). So \( v = u + 0.01 \), with \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), so \( v ∈ [0.01, 0.99) \)

If \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v ≥ 0 \implies u - 0.99 ≥ 0 \implies u ≥ 0.99 \). However, from equation 1, \( u &lt; 0.98 \), which conflicts. So this is impossible. Therefore, in Case 2, equation 3 must have \( b + c = 5 \), leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \)

So now, in Case 2, equations so far:

1. \( a + b = 3 \)
2. \( u = w - 0.02 \)
3. \( v = u + 0.01 = w - 0.02 + 0.01 = w - 0.01 \)
4. \( b + c = 5 \)
5. From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We can express \( a - c \). Since \( a + b = 3 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtract the first from the second:

\( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 3 \implies c - a = 2 \implies c = a + 2 \)

So substituting into equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

But \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - (a + 2) + v - w = -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so substituting:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = 6.05 \implies -0.01 = 6.05 \implies \)

This is impossible. Contradiction. So in Case 2, even with \( b + c =5 \), we end up with a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is impossible?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We have \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - c = -2 \)

Therefore, equation 2 becomes: \( -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = -0.01 = 6.05 \)

Which is not possible. Hence, contradiction. So even though we thought maybe Case 2 could work, the equations lead to a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is also impossible?

Wait, but both cases lead to contradictions. That can&#x27;t be. Then there are no solutions? But the problem states &quot;determine the number of real solutions&quot;, so maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple possibilities for \( a, b, c \). Wait, in Case 2, we have \( a + b = 3 \), \( b + c =5 \), so \( c = a + 2 \). Then in equation 2, substituting \( a - c = -2 \), and \( v - w \), but \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). Then equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = 4.05 \implies -2.01 =4.05 \), which is false. So that&#x27;s impossible.

But maybe I made a wrong assumption when I split the equations. Let me check again.

Wait, equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \). From Case 2:

We have \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). And \( a - c = -2 \). Therefore, equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = -2.01 \), which is not equal to 4.05. So indeed, no solution here.

Hmm. So both cases when \( a + b = 2 \) and \( 3 \) lead to contradictions. Therefore, does that mean there are no solutions? But the problem is from a competition, so it&#x27;s unlikely to have no solutions. Maybe I made a wrong approach.

Wait, let me check again the equations after substitution.

Original equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Variables:

- \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z} \)
- \( u, v, w ∈ [0,1) \)

Perhaps I need to solve these three equations for integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \).

Let me try to write these equations as linear equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to combine the equations to eliminate some variables.

First, add equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w = 7.99 \)

But equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Let me subtract equation 2 from the sum:

Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99 \)
Minus equation 2: \( (a - c + v - w) =4.05 \)
Result: \( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)
Simplify: \( 2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c =1.97 \)

But \( b + c \) must be integer since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. But 1.97 is not an integer. Contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that the system is inconsistent? But that can&#x27;t be. Wait, so even if we assume that the equations hold, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 leads to a non-integer sum, which contradicts that \( b + c \) must be integer. Therefore, there are no solutions?

But this is strange. Let me verify my steps again.

Adding equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =2.98 +5.01 =7.99 \)

Equation 2: \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Subtracting equation 2 from the sum:

\( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 2b + 2c =3.94 \implies b +c =1.97 \)

But since \( b, c \) are integers, \( b +c \) must be integer, but 1.97 is not. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, the system has no solution.

Therefore, the number of real solutions is zero.

But wait, this seems to be the case. But let me check if I added the equations correctly.

Equation 1: a + b + u - w =2.98

Equation 3: b + c + v - u =5.01

Sum: a + b + u - w + b + c + v - u =2.98 +5.01

Simplifies to: a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99

Equation 2: a - c + v - w =4.05

Subtract equation 2: (a +2b + c + v -w) - (a -c +v -w) =7.99 -4.05

Left side: a +2b +c +v -w -a +c -v +w =2b +2c

Right side:3.94

Thus, 2b +2c=3.94 =&gt; b +c=1.97, which is impossible because b and c are integers. Therefore, the system is inconsistent, no solutions.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check again for possible miscalculations.

Wait, the problem says &quot;real solutions&quot;, but in the equations, floor and fractional parts are involved, so variables x, y, z are real numbers, but with their floor and fractional parts.

But according to the above, the equations lead to a contradiction, so there&#x27;s no solution.

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the thought process. Let me check with different approaches.

Suppose I take equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w =2.98 \)

2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to express variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b =2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) integers, 2.98 -u +w must be integer. Since u, w are fractional parts, 0 ≤ u, w &lt;1, so 2.98 - u + w ∈ (2.98 -1 +0, 2.98 -0 +1) = (1.98, 3.98). Thus, possible integer values 2 or3.

Similarly, from equation3: \( b +c =5.01 -v +u \). 5.01 -v +u ∈ (5.01 -1 +0, 5.01 -0 +1)= (4.01,6.01). So integers 5 or6.

From equation2: \( a -c =4.05 -v +w \). 4.05 -v +w ∈ (4.05 -1 +0,4.05 -0 +1)= (3.05,5.05). So integers4 or5.

So possible combinations:

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

So total 8 cases. Let&#x27;s check each.

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4, subtract the equations: (a -c) - (a +b)=4 -2 =&gt; -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But from b +c=5, contradiction. So invalid.

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=2 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; -(c + b)=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Similarly, a -c=5 and a +b=2. Subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

All cases lead to contradictions. Hence, there are no solutions. Therefore, the system of equations has no real solutions. Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98, \\
\lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05, \\
-\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01,
\end{cases}
\]
we start by expressing each variable in terms of its integer and fractional parts. Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), and \( \{x\} = u \), \( \{y\} = v \), \( \{z\} = w \), where \( a, b, c \) are integers and \( u, v, w \) are fractional parts such that \( 0 \leq u, v, w &lt; 1 \).

Substituting these into the equations, we get:
1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

We analyze the possible integer values for \( a + b \), \( b + c \), and \( a - c \):
- From equation 1, \( a + b \) must be 2 or 3.
- From equation 3, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6.
- From equation 2, \( a - c \) must be 4 or 5.

We check all possible combinations of these integer values and find that each leads to a contradiction. For example, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 results in:
\[
2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c = 1.97
\]
which is impossible since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. Similarly, other combinations also lead to contradictions.

Thus, the system of equations is inconsistent and has no real solutions. The number of real solutions is:
\[
\boxed{0}

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to solve this system of equations with floor functions and fractional parts. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:

1. \( x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( \lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
3. \( -\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01 \)

Hmm, floor functions and fractional parts. Remember, for any real number \( a \), \( a = \lfloor a \rfloor + \{a\} \), where \( \lfloor a \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( a \), and \( \{a\} \) is the fractional part, so \( 0 \leq \{a\} &lt; 1 \).

Let me denote:

Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), so \( \{x\} = x - a \), where \( a \) is integer and \( 0 \leq \{x\} &lt; 1 \).

Similarly, \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \{y\} = y - b \), with \( b \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{y\} &lt; 1 \).

And \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), \( \{z\} = z - c \), \( c \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So substituting these into the equations:

1. \( x + b - (z - c) = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( x + b - z + c = 2.98 \)
   Since \( x = a + \{x\} \), and \( z = c + \{z\} \), substitute these:
   \( (a + \{x\}) + b - (c + \{z\}) + c = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{x\} + b - c - \{z\} + c = 2.98 \)
   So \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
   
2. \( a + (y - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Since \( y = b + \{y\} \), substitute:
   \( a + (b + \{y\} - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
   Again, \( z = c + \{z\} \), so:
   \( a + \{y\} - (c + \{z\}) = 4.05 \)
   Which becomes: \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)

3. \( -\{x\} + y + c = 5.01 \)
   Substitute \( y = b + \{y\} \):
   \( -\{x\} + b + \{y\} + c = 5.01 \)
   So: \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

So now, the transformed equations are:

1. \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

Additionally, we have the original variables:

- \( x = a + \{x\} \)
- \( y = b + \{y\} \)
- \( z = c + \{z\} \)

With \( a, b, c \) integers, and \( 0 \leq \{x\}, \{y\}, \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So maybe I can set variables for the fractional parts:

Let me denote:

- \( \{x\} = u \), so \( 0 \leq u &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{y\} = v \), so \( 0 \leq v &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{z\} = w \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 1 \)

So equations become:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

And variables:

- \( x = a + u \)
- \( y = b + v \)
- \( z = c + w \)

Now, the problem is to find integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \in [0,1) \) such that these equations hold.

So maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) are integers, and \( u, w \) are fractions between 0 and 1, the right-hand side (RHS) is 2.98 + (w - u). Since \( w - u \) can be between -1 and 1 (since both are less than 1), so the RHS is between 2.98 - 1 ≈ 1.98 and 2.98 + 1 ≈ 3.98. Therefore, \( a + b \) must be an integer in that interval, so possible values of \( a + b \) are 2 or 3.

Similarly, equation 3: \( b + c = 5.01 - v + u \). The RHS is 5.01 + (u - v). Since \( u - v \) is between -1 and 1, the RHS is between 4.01 and 6.01. Therefore, \( b + c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values are 5 or 6.

Equation 2: \( a - c = 4.05 - v + w \). RHS is 4.05 + (w - v). Since \( w - v \in (-1,1) \), the RHS is between 3.05 and 5.05. Therefore, \( a - c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values 4 or 5.

So let&#x27;s note the possible integer values:

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2 \) or \( 3 \)

From equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \)

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \)

So we need to find integers \( a, b, c \) such that these combinations hold. Let&#x27;s list possible cases.

Case 1: \( a + b = 2 \)

Then, equation 1 gives \( 2 + u - w = 2.98 \), so \( u - w = 0.98 \). Since \( u, w \in [0,1) \), \( u = w + 0.98 \). But since \( u &lt; 1 \), \( w + 0.98 &lt; 1 \implies w &lt; 0.02 \). Similarly, \( w = u - 0.98 \geq 0 - 0.98 = -0.98 \), but \( w \geq 0 \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 0.02 \).

So \( w \in [0, 0.02) \), and \( u = w + 0.98 \in [0.98, 1.0) \). But \( u must be less than 1, so that&#x27;s okay.

Case 1, equation 1: \( u = w + 0.98 \), \( w \in [0, 0.02) \)

Now, proceed to equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \). Let&#x27;s suppose:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then from equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v \in [0,1) \), so \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u = w + 0.98 \), and \( w &lt; 0.02 \implies u &lt; 0.98 + 0.02 = 1.0 \), so actually \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \). So for \( v = u + 0.01 \), we need \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Therefore, combining with \( u \geq 0.98 \), \( u \in [0.98, 0.99) \), which implies \( w = u - 0.98 \in [0, 0.01) \), and \( v \in [0.99, 1.0) \). But \( v must be less than 1, so okay.

Alternatively, if \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v \geq 0 \implies u - 0.99 \geq 0 \implies u \geq 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \), so \( u \geq 0.99 \implies u \in [0.99, 1.0) \). Then \( v = u - 0.99 \in [0, 0.01) \). But \( u \in [0.99, 1.0) \), so \( v \in [0, 0.01) \).

So in Case 1, equation 3 can split into two subcases: \( b + c = 5 \) leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \), or \( b + c = 6 \) leading to \( v = u - 0.99 \).

Let me hold onto that and check equation 2.

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \).

But since in Case 1, \( a + b = 2 \), and equation 3 has \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), we can express \( a - c \) in terms of \( (a + b) - (b + c) + 2c \). Wait, maybe it&#x27;s better to relate variables.

Given \( a + b = 2 \), and \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), then:

If \( a + b = 2 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtracting the first from the second: \( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 2 \implies c - a = 3 \implies c = a + 3 \)

Similarly, if \( b + c = 6 \), then \( c - a = 6 - 2 = 4 \implies c = a + 4 \)

So equation 2 is \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \). But from above:

If \( c = a + 3 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 3) = -3 \), which is not 4 or 5. So that&#x27;s impossible.

If \( c = a + 4 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 4) = -4 \), which is also not 4 or 5. So in Case 1, regardless of \( b + c = 5 \) or 6, \( a - c \) is -3 or -4, which doesn&#x27;t match the possible equation 2 values (4 or 5). Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.

Thus, there are no solutions when \( a + b = 2 \).

Proceeding to Case 2: \( a + b = 3 \)

Then equation 1: \( 3 + u - w = 2.98 \implies u - w = -0.02 \implies u = w - 0.02 \)

But \( u \geq 0 \implies w - 0.02 \geq 0 \implies w \geq 0.02 \). Also, \( w &lt; 1 \implies u = w - 0.02 &lt; 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 \). So \( u \in [0, 0.98) \), and \( w = u + 0.02 \in [0.02, 1.0) \)

So equation 1 gives \( w = u + 0.02 \), \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), \( w ∈ [0.02, 1.0) \)

Now, equation 3: \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

Again, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6 (since the RHS is 5.01 + (u - v) which is between 4.01 and 6.01, as before). So similar to before:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v &lt; 1 \implies u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Which is already true because \( u &lt; 0.98 \). So \( v = u + 0.01 \), with \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), so \( v ∈ [0.01, 0.99) \)

If \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v ≥ 0 \implies u - 0.99 ≥ 0 \implies u ≥ 0.99 \). However, from equation 1, \( u &lt; 0.98 \), which conflicts. So this is impossible. Therefore, in Case 2, equation 3 must have \( b + c = 5 \), leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \)

So now, in Case 2, equations so far:

1. \( a + b = 3 \)
2. \( u = w - 0.02 \)
3. \( v = u + 0.01 = w - 0.02 + 0.01 = w - 0.01 \)
4. \( b + c = 5 \)
5. From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We can express \( a - c \). Since \( a + b = 3 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtract the first from the second:

\( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 3 \implies c - a = 2 \implies c = a + 2 \)

So substituting into equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

But \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - (a + 2) + v - w = -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so substituting:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = 6.05 \implies -0.01 = 6.05 \implies \)

This is impossible. Contradiction. So in Case 2, even with \( b + c =5 \), we end up with a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is impossible?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We have \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - c = -2 \)

Therefore, equation 2 becomes: \( -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = -0.01 = 6.05 \)

Which is not possible. Hence, contradiction. So even though we thought maybe Case 2 could work, the equations lead to a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is also impossible?

Wait, but both cases lead to contradictions. That can&#x27;t be. Then there are no solutions? But the problem states &quot;determine the number of real solutions&quot;, so maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple possibilities for \( a, b, c \). Wait, in Case 2, we have \( a + b = 3 \), \( b + c =5 \), so \( c = a + 2 \). Then in equation 2, substituting \( a - c = -2 \), and \( v - w \), but \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). Then equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = 4.05 \implies -2.01 =4.05 \), which is false. So that&#x27;s impossible.

But maybe I made a wrong assumption when I split the equations. Let me check again.

Wait, equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \). From Case 2:

We have \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). And \( a - c = -2 \). Therefore, equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = -2.01 \), which is not equal to 4.05. So indeed, no solution here.

Hmm. So both cases when \( a + b = 2 \) and \( 3 \) lead to contradictions. Therefore, does that mean there are no solutions? But the problem is from a competition, so it&#x27;s unlikely to have no solutions. Maybe I made a wrong approach.

Wait, let me check again the equations after substitution.

Original equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Variables:

- \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z} \)
- \( u, v, w ∈ [0,1) \)

Perhaps I need to solve these three equations for integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \).

Let me try to write these equations as linear equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to combine the equations to eliminate some variables.

First, add equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w = 7.99 \)

But equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Let me subtract equation 2 from the sum:

Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99 \)
Minus equation 2: \( (a - c + v - w) =4.05 \)
Result: \( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)
Simplify: \( 2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c =1.97 \)

But \( b + c \) must be integer since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. But 1.97 is not an integer. Contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that the system is inconsistent? But that can&#x27;t be. Wait, so even if we assume that the equations hold, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 leads to a non-integer sum, which contradicts that \( b + c \) must be integer. Therefore, there are no solutions?

But this is strange. Let me verify my steps again.

Adding equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =2.98 +5.01 =7.99 \)

Equation 2: \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Subtracting equation 2 from the sum:

\( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 2b + 2c =3.94 \implies b +c =1.97 \)

But since \( b, c \) are integers, \( b +c \) must be integer, but 1.97 is not. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, the system has no solution.

Therefore, the number of real solutions is zero.

But wait, this seems to be the case. But let me check if I added the equations correctly.

Equation 1: a + b + u - w =2.98

Equation 3: b + c + v - u =5.01

Sum: a + b + u - w + b + c + v - u =2.98 +5.01

Simplifies to: a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99

Equation 2: a - c + v - w =4.05

Subtract equation 2: (a +2b + c + v -w) - (a -c +v -w) =7.99 -4.05

Left side: a +2b +c +v -w -a +c -v +w =2b +2c

Right side:3.94

Thus, 2b +2c=3.94 =&gt; b +c=1.97, which is impossible because b and c are integers. Therefore, the system is inconsistent, no solutions.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check again for possible miscalculations.

Wait, the problem says &quot;real solutions&quot;, but in the equations, floor and fractional parts are involved, so variables x, y, z are real numbers, but with their floor and fractional parts.

But according to the above, the equations lead to a contradiction, so there&#x27;s no solution.

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the thought process. Let me check with different approaches.

Suppose I take equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w =2.98 \)

2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to express variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b =2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) integers, 2.98 -u +w must be integer. Since u, w are fractional parts, 0 ≤ u, w &lt;1, so 2.98 - u + w ∈ (2.98 -1 +0, 2.98 -0 +1) = (1.98, 3.98). Thus, possible integer values 2 or3.

Similarly, from equation3: \( b +c =5.01 -v +u \). 5.01 -v +u ∈ (5.01 -1 +0, 5.01 -0 +1)= (4.01,6.01). So integers 5 or6.

From equation2: \( a -c =4.05 -v +w \). 4.05 -v +w ∈ (4.05 -1 +0,4.05 -0 +1)= (3.05,5.05). So integers4 or5.

So possible combinations:

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

So total 8 cases. Let&#x27;s check each.

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4, subtract the equations: (a -c) - (a +b)=4 -2 =&gt; -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But from b +c=5, contradiction. So invalid.

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=2 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; -(c + b)=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Similarly, a -c=5 and a +b=2. Subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

All cases lead to contradictions. Hence, there are no solutions. Therefore, the system of equations has no real solutions. Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98, \\
\lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05, \\
-\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01,
\end{cases}
\]
we start by expressing each variable in terms of its integer and fractional parts. Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), and \( \{x\} = u \), \( \{y\} = v \), \( \{z\} = w \), where \( a, b, c \) are integers and \( u, v, w \) are fractional parts such that \( 0 \leq u, v, w &lt; 1 \).

Substituting these into the equations, we get:
1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

We analyze the possible integer values for \( a + b \), \( b + c \), and \( a - c \):
- From equation 1, \( a + b \) must be 2 or 3.
- From equation 3, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6.
- From equation 2, \( a - c \) must be 4 or 5.

We check all possible combinations of these integer values and find that each leads to a contradiction. For example, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 results in:
\[
2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c = 1.97
\]
which is impossible since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. Similarly, other combinations also lead to contradictions.

Thus, the system of equations is inconsistent and has no real solutions. The number of real solutions is:
\[
\boxed{0}

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to solve this system of equations with floor functions and fractional parts. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:

1. \( x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( \lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
3. \( -\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01 \)

Hmm, floor functions and fractional parts. Remember, for any real number \( a \), \( a = \lfloor a \rfloor + \{a\} \), where \( \lfloor a \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( a \), and \( \{a\} \) is the fractional part, so \( 0 \leq \{a\} &lt; 1 \).

Let me denote:

Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), so \( \{x\} = x - a \), where \( a \) is integer and \( 0 \leq \{x\} &lt; 1 \).

Similarly, \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \{y\} = y - b \), with \( b \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{y\} &lt; 1 \).

And \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), \( \{z\} = z - c \), \( c \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So substituting these into the equations:

1. \( x + b - (z - c) = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( x + b - z + c = 2.98 \)
   Since \( x = a + \{x\} \), and \( z = c + \{z\} \), substitute these:
   \( (a + \{x\}) + b - (c + \{z\}) + c = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{x\} + b - c - \{z\} + c = 2.98 \)
   So \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
   
2. \( a + (y - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Since \( y = b + \{y\} \), substitute:
   \( a + (b + \{y\} - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
   Again, \( z = c + \{z\} \), so:
   \( a + \{y\} - (c + \{z\}) = 4.05 \)
   Which becomes: \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)

3. \( -\{x\} + y + c = 5.01 \)
   Substitute \( y = b + \{y\} \):
   \( -\{x\} + b + \{y\} + c = 5.01 \)
   So: \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

So now, the transformed equations are:

1. \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

Additionally, we have the original variables:

- \( x = a + \{x\} \)
- \( y = b + \{y\} \)
- \( z = c + \{z\} \)

With \( a, b, c \) integers, and \( 0 \leq \{x\}, \{y\}, \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So maybe I can set variables for the fractional parts:

Let me denote:

- \( \{x\} = u \), so \( 0 \leq u &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{y\} = v \), so \( 0 \leq v &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{z\} = w \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 1 \)

So equations become:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

And variables:

- \( x = a + u \)
- \( y = b + v \)
- \( z = c + w \)

Now, the problem is to find integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \in [0,1) \) such that these equations hold.

So maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) are integers, and \( u, w \) are fractions between 0 and 1, the right-hand side (RHS) is 2.98 + (w - u). Since \( w - u \) can be between -1 and 1 (since both are less than 1), so the RHS is between 2.98 - 1 ≈ 1.98 and 2.98 + 1 ≈ 3.98. Therefore, \( a + b \) must be an integer in that interval, so possible values of \( a + b \) are 2 or 3.

Similarly, equation 3: \( b + c = 5.01 - v + u \). The RHS is 5.01 + (u - v). Since \( u - v \) is between -1 and 1, the RHS is between 4.01 and 6.01. Therefore, \( b + c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values are 5 or 6.

Equation 2: \( a - c = 4.05 - v + w \). RHS is 4.05 + (w - v). Since \( w - v \in (-1,1) \), the RHS is between 3.05 and 5.05. Therefore, \( a - c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values 4 or 5.

So let&#x27;s note the possible integer values:

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2 \) or \( 3 \)

From equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \)

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \)

So we need to find integers \( a, b, c \) such that these combinations hold. Let&#x27;s list possible cases.

Case 1: \( a + b = 2 \)

Then, equation 1 gives \( 2 + u - w = 2.98 \), so \( u - w = 0.98 \). Since \( u, w \in [0,1) \), \( u = w + 0.98 \). But since \( u &lt; 1 \), \( w + 0.98 &lt; 1 \implies w &lt; 0.02 \). Similarly, \( w = u - 0.98 \geq 0 - 0.98 = -0.98 \), but \( w \geq 0 \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 0.02 \).

So \( w \in [0, 0.02) \), and \( u = w + 0.98 \in [0.98, 1.0) \). But \( u must be less than 1, so that&#x27;s okay.

Case 1, equation 1: \( u = w + 0.98 \), \( w \in [0, 0.02) \)

Now, proceed to equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \). Let&#x27;s suppose:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then from equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v \in [0,1) \), so \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u = w + 0.98 \), and \( w &lt; 0.02 \implies u &lt; 0.98 + 0.02 = 1.0 \), so actually \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \). So for \( v = u + 0.01 \), we need \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Therefore, combining with \( u \geq 0.98 \), \( u \in [0.98, 0.99) \), which implies \( w = u - 0.98 \in [0, 0.01) \), and \( v \in [0.99, 1.0) \). But \( v must be less than 1, so okay.

Alternatively, if \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v \geq 0 \implies u - 0.99 \geq 0 \implies u \geq 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \), so \( u \geq 0.99 \implies u \in [0.99, 1.0) \). Then \( v = u - 0.99 \in [0, 0.01) \). But \( u \in [0.99, 1.0) \), so \( v \in [0, 0.01) \).

So in Case 1, equation 3 can split into two subcases: \( b + c = 5 \) leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \), or \( b + c = 6 \) leading to \( v = u - 0.99 \).

Let me hold onto that and check equation 2.

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \).

But since in Case 1, \( a + b = 2 \), and equation 3 has \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), we can express \( a - c \) in terms of \( (a + b) - (b + c) + 2c \). Wait, maybe it&#x27;s better to relate variables.

Given \( a + b = 2 \), and \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), then:

If \( a + b = 2 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtracting the first from the second: \( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 2 \implies c - a = 3 \implies c = a + 3 \)

Similarly, if \( b + c = 6 \), then \( c - a = 6 - 2 = 4 \implies c = a + 4 \)

So equation 2 is \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \). But from above:

If \( c = a + 3 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 3) = -3 \), which is not 4 or 5. So that&#x27;s impossible.

If \( c = a + 4 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 4) = -4 \), which is also not 4 or 5. So in Case 1, regardless of \( b + c = 5 \) or 6, \( a - c \) is -3 or -4, which doesn&#x27;t match the possible equation 2 values (4 or 5). Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.

Thus, there are no solutions when \( a + b = 2 \).

Proceeding to Case 2: \( a + b = 3 \)

Then equation 1: \( 3 + u - w = 2.98 \implies u - w = -0.02 \implies u = w - 0.02 \)

But \( u \geq 0 \implies w - 0.02 \geq 0 \implies w \geq 0.02 \). Also, \( w &lt; 1 \implies u = w - 0.02 &lt; 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 \). So \( u \in [0, 0.98) \), and \( w = u + 0.02 \in [0.02, 1.0) \)

So equation 1 gives \( w = u + 0.02 \), \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), \( w ∈ [0.02, 1.0) \)

Now, equation 3: \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

Again, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6 (since the RHS is 5.01 + (u - v) which is between 4.01 and 6.01, as before). So similar to before:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v &lt; 1 \implies u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Which is already true because \( u &lt; 0.98 \). So \( v = u + 0.01 \), with \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), so \( v ∈ [0.01, 0.99) \)

If \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v ≥ 0 \implies u - 0.99 ≥ 0 \implies u ≥ 0.99 \). However, from equation 1, \( u &lt; 0.98 \), which conflicts. So this is impossible. Therefore, in Case 2, equation 3 must have \( b + c = 5 \), leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \)

So now, in Case 2, equations so far:

1. \( a + b = 3 \)
2. \( u = w - 0.02 \)
3. \( v = u + 0.01 = w - 0.02 + 0.01 = w - 0.01 \)
4. \( b + c = 5 \)
5. From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We can express \( a - c \). Since \( a + b = 3 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtract the first from the second:

\( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 3 \implies c - a = 2 \implies c = a + 2 \)

So substituting into equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

But \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - (a + 2) + v - w = -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so substituting:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = 6.05 \implies -0.01 = 6.05 \implies \)

This is impossible. Contradiction. So in Case 2, even with \( b + c =5 \), we end up with a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is impossible?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We have \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - c = -2 \)

Therefore, equation 2 becomes: \( -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = -0.01 = 6.05 \)

Which is not possible. Hence, contradiction. So even though we thought maybe Case 2 could work, the equations lead to a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is also impossible?

Wait, but both cases lead to contradictions. That can&#x27;t be. Then there are no solutions? But the problem states &quot;determine the number of real solutions&quot;, so maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple possibilities for \( a, b, c \). Wait, in Case 2, we have \( a + b = 3 \), \( b + c =5 \), so \( c = a + 2 \). Then in equation 2, substituting \( a - c = -2 \), and \( v - w \), but \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). Then equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = 4.05 \implies -2.01 =4.05 \), which is false. So that&#x27;s impossible.

But maybe I made a wrong assumption when I split the equations. Let me check again.

Wait, equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \). From Case 2:

We have \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). And \( a - c = -2 \). Therefore, equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = -2.01 \), which is not equal to 4.05. So indeed, no solution here.

Hmm. So both cases when \( a + b = 2 \) and \( 3 \) lead to contradictions. Therefore, does that mean there are no solutions? But the problem is from a competition, so it&#x27;s unlikely to have no solutions. Maybe I made a wrong approach.

Wait, let me check again the equations after substitution.

Original equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Variables:

- \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z} \)
- \( u, v, w ∈ [0,1) \)

Perhaps I need to solve these three equations for integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \).

Let me try to write these equations as linear equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to combine the equations to eliminate some variables.

First, add equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w = 7.99 \)

But equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Let me subtract equation 2 from the sum:

Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99 \)
Minus equation 2: \( (a - c + v - w) =4.05 \)
Result: \( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)
Simplify: \( 2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c =1.97 \)

But \( b + c \) must be integer since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. But 1.97 is not an integer. Contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that the system is inconsistent? But that can&#x27;t be. Wait, so even if we assume that the equations hold, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 leads to a non-integer sum, which contradicts that \( b + c \) must be integer. Therefore, there are no solutions?

But this is strange. Let me verify my steps again.

Adding equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =2.98 +5.01 =7.99 \)

Equation 2: \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Subtracting equation 2 from the sum:

\( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 2b + 2c =3.94 \implies b +c =1.97 \)

But since \( b, c \) are integers, \( b +c \) must be integer, but 1.97 is not. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, the system has no solution.

Therefore, the number of real solutions is zero.

But wait, this seems to be the case. But let me check if I added the equations correctly.

Equation 1: a + b + u - w =2.98

Equation 3: b + c + v - u =5.01

Sum: a + b + u - w + b + c + v - u =2.98 +5.01

Simplifies to: a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99

Equation 2: a - c + v - w =4.05

Subtract equation 2: (a +2b + c + v -w) - (a -c +v -w) =7.99 -4.05

Left side: a +2b +c +v -w -a +c -v +w =2b +2c

Right side:3.94

Thus, 2b +2c=3.94 =&gt; b +c=1.97, which is impossible because b and c are integers. Therefore, the system is inconsistent, no solutions.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check again for possible miscalculations.

Wait, the problem says &quot;real solutions&quot;, but in the equations, floor and fractional parts are involved, so variables x, y, z are real numbers, but with their floor and fractional parts.

But according to the above, the equations lead to a contradiction, so there&#x27;s no solution.

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the thought process. Let me check with different approaches.

Suppose I take equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w =2.98 \)

2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to express variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b =2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) integers, 2.98 -u +w must be integer. Since u, w are fractional parts, 0 ≤ u, w &lt;1, so 2.98 - u + w ∈ (2.98 -1 +0, 2.98 -0 +1) = (1.98, 3.98). Thus, possible integer values 2 or3.

Similarly, from equation3: \( b +c =5.01 -v +u \). 5.01 -v +u ∈ (5.01 -1 +0, 5.01 -0 +1)= (4.01,6.01). So integers 5 or6.

From equation2: \( a -c =4.05 -v +w \). 4.05 -v +w ∈ (4.05 -1 +0,4.05 -0 +1)= (3.05,5.05). So integers4 or5.

So possible combinations:

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

So total 8 cases. Let&#x27;s check each.

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4, subtract the equations: (a -c) - (a +b)=4 -2 =&gt; -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But from b +c=5, contradiction. So invalid.

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=2 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; -(c + b)=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Similarly, a -c=5 and a +b=2. Subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

All cases lead to contradictions. Hence, there are no solutions. Therefore, the system of equations has no real solutions. Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98, \\
\lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05, \\
-\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01,
\end{cases}
\]
we start by expressing each variable in terms of its integer and fractional parts. Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), and \( \{x\} = u \), \( \{y\} = v \), \( \{z\} = w \), where \( a, b, c \) are integers and \( u, v, w \) are fractional parts such that \( 0 \leq u, v, w &lt; 1 \).

Substituting these into the equations, we get:
1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

We analyze the possible integer values for \( a + b \), \( b + c \), and \( a - c \):
- From equation 1, \( a + b \) must be 2 or 3.
- From equation 3, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6.
- From equation 2, \( a - c \) must be 4 or 5.

We check all possible combinations of these integer values and find that each leads to a contradiction. For example, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 results in:
\[
2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c = 1.97
\]
which is impossible since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. Similarly, other combinations also lead to contradictions.

Thus, the system of equations is inconsistent and has no real solutions. The number of real solutions is:
\[
\boxed{0}

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to solve this system of equations with floor functions and fractional parts. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:

1. \( x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( \lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
3. \( -\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01 \)

Hmm, floor functions and fractional parts. Remember, for any real number \( a \), \( a = \lfloor a \rfloor + \{a\} \), where \( \lfloor a \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( a \), and \( \{a\} \) is the fractional part, so \( 0 \leq \{a\} &lt; 1 \).

Let me denote:

Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), so \( \{x\} = x - a \), where \( a \) is integer and \( 0 \leq \{x\} &lt; 1 \).

Similarly, \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \{y\} = y - b \), with \( b \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{y\} &lt; 1 \).

And \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), \( \{z\} = z - c \), \( c \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So substituting these into the equations:

1. \( x + b - (z - c) = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( x + b - z + c = 2.98 \)
   Since \( x = a + \{x\} \), and \( z = c + \{z\} \), substitute these:
   \( (a + \{x\}) + b - (c + \{z\}) + c = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{x\} + b - c - \{z\} + c = 2.98 \)
   So \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
   
2. \( a + (y - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Since \( y = b + \{y\} \), substitute:
   \( a + (b + \{y\} - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
   Again, \( z = c + \{z\} \), so:
   \( a + \{y\} - (c + \{z\}) = 4.05 \)
   Which becomes: \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)

3. \( -\{x\} + y + c = 5.01 \)
   Substitute \( y = b + \{y\} \):
   \( -\{x\} + b + \{y\} + c = 5.01 \)
   So: \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

So now, the transformed equations are:

1. \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

Additionally, we have the original variables:

- \( x = a + \{x\} \)
- \( y = b + \{y\} \)
- \( z = c + \{z\} \)

With \( a, b, c \) integers, and \( 0 \leq \{x\}, \{y\}, \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So maybe I can set variables for the fractional parts:

Let me denote:

- \( \{x\} = u \), so \( 0 \leq u &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{y\} = v \), so \( 0 \leq v &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{z\} = w \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 1 \)

So equations become:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

And variables:

- \( x = a + u \)
- \( y = b + v \)
- \( z = c + w \)

Now, the problem is to find integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \in [0,1) \) such that these equations hold.

So maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) are integers, and \( u, w \) are fractions between 0 and 1, the right-hand side (RHS) is 2.98 + (w - u). Since \( w - u \) can be between -1 and 1 (since both are less than 1), so the RHS is between 2.98 - 1 ≈ 1.98 and 2.98 + 1 ≈ 3.98. Therefore, \( a + b \) must be an integer in that interval, so possible values of \( a + b \) are 2 or 3.

Similarly, equation 3: \( b + c = 5.01 - v + u \). The RHS is 5.01 + (u - v). Since \( u - v \) is between -1 and 1, the RHS is between 4.01 and 6.01. Therefore, \( b + c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values are 5 or 6.

Equation 2: \( a - c = 4.05 - v + w \). RHS is 4.05 + (w - v). Since \( w - v \in (-1,1) \), the RHS is between 3.05 and 5.05. Therefore, \( a - c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values 4 or 5.

So let&#x27;s note the possible integer values:

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2 \) or \( 3 \)

From equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \)

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \)

So we need to find integers \( a, b, c \) such that these combinations hold. Let&#x27;s list possible cases.

Case 1: \( a + b = 2 \)

Then, equation 1 gives \( 2 + u - w = 2.98 \), so \( u - w = 0.98 \). Since \( u, w \in [0,1) \), \( u = w + 0.98 \). But since \( u &lt; 1 \), \( w + 0.98 &lt; 1 \implies w &lt; 0.02 \). Similarly, \( w = u - 0.98 \geq 0 - 0.98 = -0.98 \), but \( w \geq 0 \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 0.02 \).

So \( w \in [0, 0.02) \), and \( u = w + 0.98 \in [0.98, 1.0) \). But \( u must be less than 1, so that&#x27;s okay.

Case 1, equation 1: \( u = w + 0.98 \), \( w \in [0, 0.02) \)

Now, proceed to equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \). Let&#x27;s suppose:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then from equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v \in [0,1) \), so \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u = w + 0.98 \), and \( w &lt; 0.02 \implies u &lt; 0.98 + 0.02 = 1.0 \), so actually \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \). So for \( v = u + 0.01 \), we need \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Therefore, combining with \( u \geq 0.98 \), \( u \in [0.98, 0.99) \), which implies \( w = u - 0.98 \in [0, 0.01) \), and \( v \in [0.99, 1.0) \). But \( v must be less than 1, so okay.

Alternatively, if \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v \geq 0 \implies u - 0.99 \geq 0 \implies u \geq 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \), so \( u \geq 0.99 \implies u \in [0.99, 1.0) \). Then \( v = u - 0.99 \in [0, 0.01) \). But \( u \in [0.99, 1.0) \), so \( v \in [0, 0.01) \).

So in Case 1, equation 3 can split into two subcases: \( b + c = 5 \) leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \), or \( b + c = 6 \) leading to \( v = u - 0.99 \).

Let me hold onto that and check equation 2.

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \).

But since in Case 1, \( a + b = 2 \), and equation 3 has \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), we can express \( a - c \) in terms of \( (a + b) - (b + c) + 2c \). Wait, maybe it&#x27;s better to relate variables.

Given \( a + b = 2 \), and \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), then:

If \( a + b = 2 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtracting the first from the second: \( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 2 \implies c - a = 3 \implies c = a + 3 \)

Similarly, if \( b + c = 6 \), then \( c - a = 6 - 2 = 4 \implies c = a + 4 \)

So equation 2 is \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \). But from above:

If \( c = a + 3 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 3) = -3 \), which is not 4 or 5. So that&#x27;s impossible.

If \( c = a + 4 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 4) = -4 \), which is also not 4 or 5. So in Case 1, regardless of \( b + c = 5 \) or 6, \( a - c \) is -3 or -4, which doesn&#x27;t match the possible equation 2 values (4 or 5). Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.

Thus, there are no solutions when \( a + b = 2 \).

Proceeding to Case 2: \( a + b = 3 \)

Then equation 1: \( 3 + u - w = 2.98 \implies u - w = -0.02 \implies u = w - 0.02 \)

But \( u \geq 0 \implies w - 0.02 \geq 0 \implies w \geq 0.02 \). Also, \( w &lt; 1 \implies u = w - 0.02 &lt; 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 \). So \( u \in [0, 0.98) \), and \( w = u + 0.02 \in [0.02, 1.0) \)

So equation 1 gives \( w = u + 0.02 \), \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), \( w ∈ [0.02, 1.0) \)

Now, equation 3: \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

Again, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6 (since the RHS is 5.01 + (u - v) which is between 4.01 and 6.01, as before). So similar to before:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v &lt; 1 \implies u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Which is already true because \( u &lt; 0.98 \). So \( v = u + 0.01 \), with \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), so \( v ∈ [0.01, 0.99) \)

If \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v ≥ 0 \implies u - 0.99 ≥ 0 \implies u ≥ 0.99 \). However, from equation 1, \( u &lt; 0.98 \), which conflicts. So this is impossible. Therefore, in Case 2, equation 3 must have \( b + c = 5 \), leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \)

So now, in Case 2, equations so far:

1. \( a + b = 3 \)
2. \( u = w - 0.02 \)
3. \( v = u + 0.01 = w - 0.02 + 0.01 = w - 0.01 \)
4. \( b + c = 5 \)
5. From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We can express \( a - c \). Since \( a + b = 3 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtract the first from the second:

\( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 3 \implies c - a = 2 \implies c = a + 2 \)

So substituting into equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

But \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - (a + 2) + v - w = -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so substituting:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = 6.05 \implies -0.01 = 6.05 \implies \)

This is impossible. Contradiction. So in Case 2, even with \( b + c =5 \), we end up with a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is impossible?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We have \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - c = -2 \)

Therefore, equation 2 becomes: \( -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = -0.01 = 6.05 \)

Which is not possible. Hence, contradiction. So even though we thought maybe Case 2 could work, the equations lead to a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is also impossible?

Wait, but both cases lead to contradictions. That can&#x27;t be. Then there are no solutions? But the problem states &quot;determine the number of real solutions&quot;, so maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple possibilities for \( a, b, c \). Wait, in Case 2, we have \( a + b = 3 \), \( b + c =5 \), so \( c = a + 2 \). Then in equation 2, substituting \( a - c = -2 \), and \( v - w \), but \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). Then equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = 4.05 \implies -2.01 =4.05 \), which is false. So that&#x27;s impossible.

But maybe I made a wrong assumption when I split the equations. Let me check again.

Wait, equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \). From Case 2:

We have \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). And \( a - c = -2 \). Therefore, equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = -2.01 \), which is not equal to 4.05. So indeed, no solution here.

Hmm. So both cases when \( a + b = 2 \) and \( 3 \) lead to contradictions. Therefore, does that mean there are no solutions? But the problem is from a competition, so it&#x27;s unlikely to have no solutions. Maybe I made a wrong approach.

Wait, let me check again the equations after substitution.

Original equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Variables:

- \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z} \)
- \( u, v, w ∈ [0,1) \)

Perhaps I need to solve these three equations for integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \).

Let me try to write these equations as linear equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to combine the equations to eliminate some variables.

First, add equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w = 7.99 \)

But equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Let me subtract equation 2 from the sum:

Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99 \)
Minus equation 2: \( (a - c + v - w) =4.05 \)
Result: \( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)
Simplify: \( 2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c =1.97 \)

But \( b + c \) must be integer since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. But 1.97 is not an integer. Contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that the system is inconsistent? But that can&#x27;t be. Wait, so even if we assume that the equations hold, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 leads to a non-integer sum, which contradicts that \( b + c \) must be integer. Therefore, there are no solutions?

But this is strange. Let me verify my steps again.

Adding equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =2.98 +5.01 =7.99 \)

Equation 2: \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Subtracting equation 2 from the sum:

\( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 2b + 2c =3.94 \implies b +c =1.97 \)

But since \( b, c \) are integers, \( b +c \) must be integer, but 1.97 is not. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, the system has no solution.

Therefore, the number of real solutions is zero.

But wait, this seems to be the case. But let me check if I added the equations correctly.

Equation 1: a + b + u - w =2.98

Equation 3: b + c + v - u =5.01

Sum: a + b + u - w + b + c + v - u =2.98 +5.01

Simplifies to: a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99

Equation 2: a - c + v - w =4.05

Subtract equation 2: (a +2b + c + v -w) - (a -c +v -w) =7.99 -4.05

Left side: a +2b +c +v -w -a +c -v +w =2b +2c

Right side:3.94

Thus, 2b +2c=3.94 =&gt; b +c=1.97, which is impossible because b and c are integers. Therefore, the system is inconsistent, no solutions.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check again for possible miscalculations.

Wait, the problem says &quot;real solutions&quot;, but in the equations, floor and fractional parts are involved, so variables x, y, z are real numbers, but with their floor and fractional parts.

But according to the above, the equations lead to a contradiction, so there&#x27;s no solution.

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the thought process. Let me check with different approaches.

Suppose I take equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w =2.98 \)

2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to express variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b =2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) integers, 2.98 -u +w must be integer. Since u, w are fractional parts, 0 ≤ u, w &lt;1, so 2.98 - u + w ∈ (2.98 -1 +0, 2.98 -0 +1) = (1.98, 3.98). Thus, possible integer values 2 or3.

Similarly, from equation3: \( b +c =5.01 -v +u \). 5.01 -v +u ∈ (5.01 -1 +0, 5.01 -0 +1)= (4.01,6.01). So integers 5 or6.

From equation2: \( a -c =4.05 -v +w \). 4.05 -v +w ∈ (4.05 -1 +0,4.05 -0 +1)= (3.05,5.05). So integers4 or5.

So possible combinations:

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

So total 8 cases. Let&#x27;s check each.

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4, subtract the equations: (a -c) - (a +b)=4 -2 =&gt; -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But from b +c=5, contradiction. So invalid.

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=2 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; -(c + b)=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Similarly, a -c=5 and a +b=2. Subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

All cases lead to contradictions. Hence, there are no solutions. Therefore, the system of equations has no real solutions. Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98, \\
\lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05, \\
-\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01,
\end{cases}
\]
we start by expressing each variable in terms of its integer and fractional parts. Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), and \( \{x\} = u \), \( \{y\} = v \), \( \{z\} = w \), where \( a, b, c \) are integers and \( u, v, w \) are fractional parts such that \( 0 \leq u, v, w &lt; 1 \).

Substituting these into the equations, we get:
1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

We analyze the possible integer values for \( a + b \), \( b + c \), and \( a - c \):
- From equation 1, \( a + b \) must be 2 or 3.
- From equation 3, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6.
- From equation 2, \( a - c \) must be 4 or 5.

We check all possible combinations of these integer values and find that each leads to a contradiction. For example, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 results in:
\[
2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c = 1.97
\]
which is impossible since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. Similarly, other combinations also lead to contradictions.

Thus, the system of equations is inconsistent and has no real solutions. The number of real solutions is:
\[
\boxed{0}

Response: \boxed{3}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to solve this system of equations with floor functions and fractional parts. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:

1. \( x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( \lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
3. \( -\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01 \)

Hmm, floor functions and fractional parts. Remember, for any real number \( a \), \( a = \lfloor a \rfloor + \{a\} \), where \( \lfloor a \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( a \), and \( \{a\} \) is the fractional part, so \( 0 \leq \{a\} &lt; 1 \).

Let me denote:

Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), so \( \{x\} = x - a \), where \( a \) is integer and \( 0 \leq \{x\} &lt; 1 \).

Similarly, \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \{y\} = y - b \), with \( b \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{y\} &lt; 1 \).

And \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), \( \{z\} = z - c \), \( c \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So substituting these into the equations:

1. \( x + b - (z - c) = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( x + b - z + c = 2.98 \)
   Since \( x = a + \{x\} \), and \( z = c + \{z\} \), substitute these:
   \( (a + \{x\}) + b - (c + \{z\}) + c = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{x\} + b - c - \{z\} + c = 2.98 \)
   So \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
   
2. \( a + (y - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Since \( y = b + \{y\} \), substitute:
   \( a + (b + \{y\} - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
   Again, \( z = c + \{z\} \), so:
   \( a + \{y\} - (c + \{z\}) = 4.05 \)
   Which becomes: \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)

3. \( -\{x\} + y + c = 5.01 \)
   Substitute \( y = b + \{y\} \):
   \( -\{x\} + b + \{y\} + c = 5.01 \)
   So: \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

So now, the transformed equations are:

1. \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

Additionally, we have the original variables:

- \( x = a + \{x\} \)
- \( y = b + \{y\} \)
- \( z = c + \{z\} \)

With \( a, b, c \) integers, and \( 0 \leq \{x\}, \{y\}, \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So maybe I can set variables for the fractional parts:

Let me denote:

- \( \{x\} = u \), so \( 0 \leq u &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{y\} = v \), so \( 0 \leq v &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{z\} = w \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 1 \)

So equations become:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

And variables:

- \( x = a + u \)
- \( y = b + v \)
- \( z = c + w \)

Now, the problem is to find integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \in [0,1) \) such that these equations hold.

So maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) are integers, and \( u, w \) are fractions between 0 and 1, the right-hand side (RHS) is 2.98 + (w - u). Since \( w - u \) can be between -1 and 1 (since both are less than 1), so the RHS is between 2.98 - 1 ≈ 1.98 and 2.98 + 1 ≈ 3.98. Therefore, \( a + b \) must be an integer in that interval, so possible values of \( a + b \) are 2 or 3.

Similarly, equation 3: \( b + c = 5.01 - v + u \). The RHS is 5.01 + (u - v). Since \( u - v \) is between -1 and 1, the RHS is between 4.01 and 6.01. Therefore, \( b + c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values are 5 or 6.

Equation 2: \( a - c = 4.05 - v + w \). RHS is 4.05 + (w - v). Since \( w - v \in (-1,1) \), the RHS is between 3.05 and 5.05. Therefore, \( a - c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values 4 or 5.

So let&#x27;s note the possible integer values:

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2 \) or \( 3 \)

From equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \)

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \)

So we need to find integers \( a, b, c \) such that these combinations hold. Let&#x27;s list possible cases.

Case 1: \( a + b = 2 \)

Then, equation 1 gives \( 2 + u - w = 2.98 \), so \( u - w = 0.98 \). Since \( u, w \in [0,1) \), \( u = w + 0.98 \). But since \( u &lt; 1 \), \( w + 0.98 &lt; 1 \implies w &lt; 0.02 \). Similarly, \( w = u - 0.98 \geq 0 - 0.98 = -0.98 \), but \( w \geq 0 \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 0.02 \).

So \( w \in [0, 0.02) \), and \( u = w + 0.98 \in [0.98, 1.0) \). But \( u must be less than 1, so that&#x27;s okay.

Case 1, equation 1: \( u = w + 0.98 \), \( w \in [0, 0.02) \)

Now, proceed to equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \). Let&#x27;s suppose:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then from equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v \in [0,1) \), so \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u = w + 0.98 \), and \( w &lt; 0.02 \implies u &lt; 0.98 + 0.02 = 1.0 \), so actually \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \). So for \( v = u + 0.01 \), we need \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Therefore, combining with \( u \geq 0.98 \), \( u \in [0.98, 0.99) \), which implies \( w = u - 0.98 \in [0, 0.01) \), and \( v \in [0.99, 1.0) \). But \( v must be less than 1, so okay.

Alternatively, if \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v \geq 0 \implies u - 0.99 \geq 0 \implies u \geq 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \), so \( u \geq 0.99 \implies u \in [0.99, 1.0) \). Then \( v = u - 0.99 \in [0, 0.01) \). But \( u \in [0.99, 1.0) \), so \( v \in [0, 0.01) \).

So in Case 1, equation 3 can split into two subcases: \( b + c = 5 \) leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \), or \( b + c = 6 \) leading to \( v = u - 0.99 \).

Let me hold onto that and check equation 2.

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \).

But since in Case 1, \( a + b = 2 \), and equation 3 has \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), we can express \( a - c \) in terms of \( (a + b) - (b + c) + 2c \). Wait, maybe it&#x27;s better to relate variables.

Given \( a + b = 2 \), and \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), then:

If \( a + b = 2 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtracting the first from the second: \( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 2 \implies c - a = 3 \implies c = a + 3 \)

Similarly, if \( b + c = 6 \), then \( c - a = 6 - 2 = 4 \implies c = a + 4 \)

So equation 2 is \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \). But from above:

If \( c = a + 3 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 3) = -3 \), which is not 4 or 5. So that&#x27;s impossible.

If \( c = a + 4 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 4) = -4 \), which is also not 4 or 5. So in Case 1, regardless of \( b + c = 5 \) or 6, \( a - c \) is -3 or -4, which doesn&#x27;t match the possible equation 2 values (4 or 5). Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.

Thus, there are no solutions when \( a + b = 2 \).

Proceeding to Case 2: \( a + b = 3 \)

Then equation 1: \( 3 + u - w = 2.98 \implies u - w = -0.02 \implies u = w - 0.02 \)

But \( u \geq 0 \implies w - 0.02 \geq 0 \implies w \geq 0.02 \). Also, \( w &lt; 1 \implies u = w - 0.02 &lt; 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 \). So \( u \in [0, 0.98) \), and \( w = u + 0.02 \in [0.02, 1.0) \)

So equation 1 gives \( w = u + 0.02 \), \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), \( w ∈ [0.02, 1.0) \)

Now, equation 3: \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

Again, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6 (since the RHS is 5.01 + (u - v) which is between 4.01 and 6.01, as before). So similar to before:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v &lt; 1 \implies u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Which is already true because \( u &lt; 0.98 \). So \( v = u + 0.01 \), with \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), so \( v ∈ [0.01, 0.99) \)

If \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v ≥ 0 \implies u - 0.99 ≥ 0 \implies u ≥ 0.99 \). However, from equation 1, \( u &lt; 0.98 \), which conflicts. So this is impossible. Therefore, in Case 2, equation 3 must have \( b + c = 5 \), leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \)

So now, in Case 2, equations so far:

1. \( a + b = 3 \)
2. \( u = w - 0.02 \)
3. \( v = u + 0.01 = w - 0.02 + 0.01 = w - 0.01 \)
4. \( b + c = 5 \)
5. From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We can express \( a - c \). Since \( a + b = 3 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtract the first from the second:

\( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 3 \implies c - a = 2 \implies c = a + 2 \)

So substituting into equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

But \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - (a + 2) + v - w = -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so substituting:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = 6.05 \implies -0.01 = 6.05 \implies \)

This is impossible. Contradiction. So in Case 2, even with \( b + c =5 \), we end up with a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is impossible?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We have \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - c = -2 \)

Therefore, equation 2 becomes: \( -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = -0.01 = 6.05 \)

Which is not possible. Hence, contradiction. So even though we thought maybe Case 2 could work, the equations lead to a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is also impossible?

Wait, but both cases lead to contradictions. That can&#x27;t be. Then there are no solutions? But the problem states &quot;determine the number of real solutions&quot;, so maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple possibilities for \( a, b, c \). Wait, in Case 2, we have \( a + b = 3 \), \( b + c =5 \), so \( c = a + 2 \). Then in equation 2, substituting \( a - c = -2 \), and \( v - w \), but \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). Then equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = 4.05 \implies -2.01 =4.05 \), which is false. So that&#x27;s impossible.

But maybe I made a wrong assumption when I split the equations. Let me check again.

Wait, equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \). From Case 2:

We have \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). And \( a - c = -2 \). Therefore, equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = -2.01 \), which is not equal to 4.05. So indeed, no solution here.

Hmm. So both cases when \( a + b = 2 \) and \( 3 \) lead to contradictions. Therefore, does that mean there are no solutions? But the problem is from a competition, so it&#x27;s unlikely to have no solutions. Maybe I made a wrong approach.

Wait, let me check again the equations after substitution.

Original equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Variables:

- \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z} \)
- \( u, v, w ∈ [0,1) \)

Perhaps I need to solve these three equations for integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \).

Let me try to write these equations as linear equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to combine the equations to eliminate some variables.

First, add equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w = 7.99 \)

But equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Let me subtract equation 2 from the sum:

Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99 \)
Minus equation 2: \( (a - c + v - w) =4.05 \)
Result: \( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)
Simplify: \( 2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c =1.97 \)

But \( b + c \) must be integer since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. But 1.97 is not an integer. Contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that the system is inconsistent? But that can&#x27;t be. Wait, so even if we assume that the equations hold, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 leads to a non-integer sum, which contradicts that \( b + c \) must be integer. Therefore, there are no solutions?

But this is strange. Let me verify my steps again.

Adding equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =2.98 +5.01 =7.99 \)

Equation 2: \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Subtracting equation 2 from the sum:

\( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 2b + 2c =3.94 \implies b +c =1.97 \)

But since \( b, c \) are integers, \( b +c \) must be integer, but 1.97 is not. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, the system has no solution.

Therefore, the number of real solutions is zero.

But wait, this seems to be the case. But let me check if I added the equations correctly.

Equation 1: a + b + u - w =2.98

Equation 3: b + c + v - u =5.01

Sum: a + b + u - w + b + c + v - u =2.98 +5.01

Simplifies to: a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99

Equation 2: a - c + v - w =4.05

Subtract equation 2: (a +2b + c + v -w) - (a -c +v -w) =7.99 -4.05

Left side: a +2b +c +v -w -a +c -v +w =2b +2c

Right side:3.94

Thus, 2b +2c=3.94 =&gt; b +c=1.97, which is impossible because b and c are integers. Therefore, the system is inconsistent, no solutions.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check again for possible miscalculations.

Wait, the problem says &quot;real solutions&quot;, but in the equations, floor and fractional parts are involved, so variables x, y, z are real numbers, but with their floor and fractional parts.

But according to the above, the equations lead to a contradiction, so there&#x27;s no solution.

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the thought process. Let me check with different approaches.

Suppose I take equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w =2.98 \)

2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to express variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b =2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) integers, 2.98 -u +w must be integer. Since u, w are fractional parts, 0 ≤ u, w &lt;1, so 2.98 - u + w ∈ (2.98 -1 +0, 2.98 -0 +1) = (1.98, 3.98). Thus, possible integer values 2 or3.

Similarly, from equation3: \( b +c =5.01 -v +u \). 5.01 -v +u ∈ (5.01 -1 +0, 5.01 -0 +1)= (4.01,6.01). So integers 5 or6.

From equation2: \( a -c =4.05 -v +w \). 4.05 -v +w ∈ (4.05 -1 +0,4.05 -0 +1)= (3.05,5.05). So integers4 or5.

So possible combinations:

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

So total 8 cases. Let&#x27;s check each.

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4, subtract the equations: (a -c) - (a +b)=4 -2 =&gt; -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But from b +c=5, contradiction. So invalid.

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=2 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; -(c + b)=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Similarly, a -c=5 and a +b=2. Subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

All cases lead to contradictions. Hence, there are no solutions. Therefore, the system of equations has no real solutions. Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98, \\
\lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05, \\
-\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01,
\end{cases}
\]
we start by expressing each variable in terms of its integer and fractional parts. Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), and \( \{x\} = u \), \( \{y\} = v \), \( \{z\} = w \), where \( a, b, c \) are integers and \( u, v, w \) are fractional parts such that \( 0 \leq u, v, w &lt; 1 \).

Substituting these into the equations, we get:
1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

We analyze the possible integer values for \( a + b \), \( b + c \), and \( a - c \):
- From equation 1, \( a + b \) must be 2 or 3.
- From equation 3, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6.
- From equation 2, \( a - c \) must be 4 or 5.

We check all possible combinations of these integer values and find that each leads to a contradiction. For example, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 results in:
\[
2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c = 1.97
\]
which is impossible since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. Similarly, other combinations also lead to contradictions.

Thus, the system of equations is inconsistent and has no real solutions. The number of real solutions is:
\[
\boxed{0}

Response: \boxed{2}          </p>
          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to solve this system of equations with floor functions and fractional parts. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right:

1. \( x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( \lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
3. \( -\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01 \)

Hmm, floor functions and fractional parts. Remember, for any real number \( a \), \( a = \lfloor a \rfloor + \{a\} \), where \( \lfloor a \rfloor \) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( a \), and \( \{a\} \) is the fractional part, so \( 0 \leq \{a\} &lt; 1 \).

Let me denote:

Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), so \( \{x\} = x - a \), where \( a \) is integer and \( 0 \leq \{x\} &lt; 1 \).

Similarly, \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \{y\} = y - b \), with \( b \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{y\} &lt; 1 \).

And \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), \( \{z\} = z - c \), \( c \) integer, \( 0 \leq \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So substituting these into the equations:

1. \( x + b - (z - c) = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( x + b - z + c = 2.98 \)
   Since \( x = a + \{x\} \), and \( z = c + \{z\} \), substitute these:
   \( (a + \{x\}) + b - (c + \{z\}) + c = 2.98 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{x\} + b - c - \{z\} + c = 2.98 \)
   So \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
   
2. \( a + (y - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Since \( y = b + \{y\} \), substitute:
   \( a + (b + \{y\} - b) - z = 4.05 \)
   Simplify: \( a + \{y\} - z = 4.05 \)
   Again, \( z = c + \{z\} \), so:
   \( a + \{y\} - (c + \{z\}) = 4.05 \)
   Which becomes: \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)

3. \( -\{x\} + y + c = 5.01 \)
   Substitute \( y = b + \{y\} \):
   \( -\{x\} + b + \{y\} + c = 5.01 \)
   So: \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

So now, the transformed equations are:

1. \( a + b + \{x\} - \{z\} = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + \{y\} - \{z\} = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + \{y\} - \{x\} = 5.01 \)

Additionally, we have the original variables:

- \( x = a + \{x\} \)
- \( y = b + \{y\} \)
- \( z = c + \{z\} \)

With \( a, b, c \) integers, and \( 0 \leq \{x\}, \{y\}, \{z\} &lt; 1 \).

So maybe I can set variables for the fractional parts:

Let me denote:

- \( \{x\} = u \), so \( 0 \leq u &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{y\} = v \), so \( 0 \leq v &lt; 1 \)
- \( \{z\} = w \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 1 \)

So equations become:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

And variables:

- \( x = a + u \)
- \( y = b + v \)
- \( z = c + w \)

Now, the problem is to find integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \in [0,1) \) such that these equations hold.

So maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) are integers, and \( u, w \) are fractions between 0 and 1, the right-hand side (RHS) is 2.98 + (w - u). Since \( w - u \) can be between -1 and 1 (since both are less than 1), so the RHS is between 2.98 - 1 ≈ 1.98 and 2.98 + 1 ≈ 3.98. Therefore, \( a + b \) must be an integer in that interval, so possible values of \( a + b \) are 2 or 3.

Similarly, equation 3: \( b + c = 5.01 - v + u \). The RHS is 5.01 + (u - v). Since \( u - v \) is between -1 and 1, the RHS is between 4.01 and 6.01. Therefore, \( b + c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values are 5 or 6.

Equation 2: \( a - c = 4.05 - v + w \). RHS is 4.05 + (w - v). Since \( w - v \in (-1,1) \), the RHS is between 3.05 and 5.05. Therefore, \( a - c \) must be integer in that interval, so possible values 4 or 5.

So let&#x27;s note the possible integer values:

From equation 1: \( a + b = 2 \) or \( 3 \)

From equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \)

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \)

So we need to find integers \( a, b, c \) such that these combinations hold. Let&#x27;s list possible cases.

Case 1: \( a + b = 2 \)

Then, equation 1 gives \( 2 + u - w = 2.98 \), so \( u - w = 0.98 \). Since \( u, w \in [0,1) \), \( u = w + 0.98 \). But since \( u &lt; 1 \), \( w + 0.98 &lt; 1 \implies w &lt; 0.02 \). Similarly, \( w = u - 0.98 \geq 0 - 0.98 = -0.98 \), but \( w \geq 0 \), so \( 0 \leq w &lt; 0.02 \).

So \( w \in [0, 0.02) \), and \( u = w + 0.98 \in [0.98, 1.0) \). But \( u must be less than 1, so that&#x27;s okay.

Case 1, equation 1: \( u = w + 0.98 \), \( w \in [0, 0.02) \)

Now, proceed to equation 3: \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \). Let&#x27;s suppose:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then from equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v \in [0,1) \), so \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u = w + 0.98 \), and \( w &lt; 0.02 \implies u &lt; 0.98 + 0.02 = 1.0 \), so actually \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \). So for \( v = u + 0.01 \), we need \( u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Therefore, combining with \( u \geq 0.98 \), \( u \in [0.98, 0.99) \), which implies \( w = u - 0.98 \in [0, 0.01) \), and \( v \in [0.99, 1.0) \). But \( v must be less than 1, so okay.

Alternatively, if \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v \geq 0 \implies u - 0.99 \geq 0 \implies u \geq 0.99 \). But from equation 1, \( u \in [0.98, 1.0) \), so \( u \geq 0.99 \implies u \in [0.99, 1.0) \). Then \( v = u - 0.99 \in [0, 0.01) \). But \( u \in [0.99, 1.0) \), so \( v \in [0, 0.01) \).

So in Case 1, equation 3 can split into two subcases: \( b + c = 5 \) leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \), or \( b + c = 6 \) leading to \( v = u - 0.99 \).

Let me hold onto that and check equation 2.

From equation 2: \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \).

But since in Case 1, \( a + b = 2 \), and equation 3 has \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), we can express \( a - c \) in terms of \( (a + b) - (b + c) + 2c \). Wait, maybe it&#x27;s better to relate variables.

Given \( a + b = 2 \), and \( b + c = 5 \) or \( 6 \), then:

If \( a + b = 2 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtracting the first from the second: \( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 2 \implies c - a = 3 \implies c = a + 3 \)

Similarly, if \( b + c = 6 \), then \( c - a = 6 - 2 = 4 \implies c = a + 4 \)

So equation 2 is \( a - c = 4 \) or \( 5 \). But from above:

If \( c = a + 3 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 3) = -3 \), which is not 4 or 5. So that&#x27;s impossible.

If \( c = a + 4 \), then \( a - c = a - (a + 4) = -4 \), which is also not 4 or 5. So in Case 1, regardless of \( b + c = 5 \) or 6, \( a - c \) is -3 or -4, which doesn&#x27;t match the possible equation 2 values (4 or 5). Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.

Thus, there are no solutions when \( a + b = 2 \).

Proceeding to Case 2: \( a + b = 3 \)

Then equation 1: \( 3 + u - w = 2.98 \implies u - w = -0.02 \implies u = w - 0.02 \)

But \( u \geq 0 \implies w - 0.02 \geq 0 \implies w \geq 0.02 \). Also, \( w &lt; 1 \implies u = w - 0.02 &lt; 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 \). So \( u \in [0, 0.98) \), and \( w = u + 0.02 \in [0.02, 1.0) \)

So equation 1 gives \( w = u + 0.02 \), \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), \( w ∈ [0.02, 1.0) \)

Now, equation 3: \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

Again, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6 (since the RHS is 5.01 + (u - v) which is between 4.01 and 6.01, as before). So similar to before:

If \( b + c = 5 \), then equation 3: \( 5 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = 0.01 \implies v = u + 0.01 \)

But \( v &lt; 1 \implies u + 0.01 &lt; 1 \implies u &lt; 0.99 \). Which is already true because \( u &lt; 0.98 \). So \( v = u + 0.01 \), with \( u ∈ [0, 0.98) \), so \( v ∈ [0.01, 0.99) \)

If \( b + c = 6 \), then equation 3: \( 6 + v - u = 5.01 \implies v - u = -0.99 \implies v = u - 0.99 \)

But \( v ≥ 0 \implies u - 0.99 ≥ 0 \implies u ≥ 0.99 \). However, from equation 1, \( u &lt; 0.98 \), which conflicts. So this is impossible. Therefore, in Case 2, equation 3 must have \( b + c = 5 \), leading to \( v = u + 0.01 \)

So now, in Case 2, equations so far:

1. \( a + b = 3 \)
2. \( u = w - 0.02 \)
3. \( v = u + 0.01 = w - 0.02 + 0.01 = w - 0.01 \)
4. \( b + c = 5 \)
5. From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We can express \( a - c \). Since \( a + b = 3 \) and \( b + c = 5 \), subtract the first from the second:

\( (b + c) - (a + b) = 5 - 3 \implies c - a = 2 \implies c = a + 2 \)

So substituting into equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

But \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - (a + 2) + v - w = -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so substituting:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = 6.05 \implies -0.01 = 6.05 \implies \)

This is impossible. Contradiction. So in Case 2, even with \( b + c =5 \), we end up with a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is impossible?

Wait, hold on. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

From equation 2: \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)

We have \( c = a + 2 \), so \( a - c = -2 \)

Therefore, equation 2 becomes: \( -2 + v - w = 4.05 \implies v - w = 6.05 \)

But \( v = w - 0.01 \), so:

\( (w - 0.01) - w = -0.01 = 6.05 \)

Which is not possible. Hence, contradiction. So even though we thought maybe Case 2 could work, the equations lead to a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is also impossible?

Wait, but both cases lead to contradictions. That can&#x27;t be. Then there are no solutions? But the problem states &quot;determine the number of real solutions&quot;, so maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple possibilities for \( a, b, c \). Wait, in Case 2, we have \( a + b = 3 \), \( b + c =5 \), so \( c = a + 2 \). Then in equation 2, substituting \( a - c = -2 \), and \( v - w \), but \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). Then equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = 4.05 \implies -2.01 =4.05 \), which is false. So that&#x27;s impossible.

But maybe I made a wrong assumption when I split the equations. Let me check again.

Wait, equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \). From Case 2:

We have \( v = w -0.01 \), so \( v -w = -0.01 \). And \( a - c = -2 \). Therefore, equation 2 becomes \( -2 -0.01 = -2.01 \), which is not equal to 4.05. So indeed, no solution here.

Hmm. So both cases when \( a + b = 2 \) and \( 3 \) lead to contradictions. Therefore, does that mean there are no solutions? But the problem is from a competition, so it&#x27;s unlikely to have no solutions. Maybe I made a wrong approach.

Wait, let me check again the equations after substitution.

Original equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Variables:

- \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z} \)
- \( u, v, w ∈ [0,1) \)

Perhaps I need to solve these three equations for integers \( a, b, c \) and fractional parts \( u, v, w \).

Let me try to write these equations as linear equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to combine the equations to eliminate some variables.

First, add equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w = 7.99 \)

But equation 2 is \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Let me subtract equation 2 from the sum:

Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99 \)
Minus equation 2: \( (a - c + v - w) =4.05 \)
Result: \( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)
Simplify: \( 2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c =1.97 \)

But \( b + c \) must be integer since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. But 1.97 is not an integer. Contradiction.

Wait, this suggests that the system is inconsistent? But that can&#x27;t be. Wait, so even if we assume that the equations hold, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 leads to a non-integer sum, which contradicts that \( b + c \) must be integer. Therefore, there are no solutions?

But this is strange. Let me verify my steps again.

Adding equations 1 and 3:

1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)
Sum: \( a + 2b + c + v - w =2.98 +5.01 =7.99 \)

Equation 2: \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

Subtracting equation 2 from the sum:

\( (a + 2b + c + v - w) - (a - c + v - w) =7.99 -4.05 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 2b + 2c =3.94 \implies b +c =1.97 \)

But since \( b, c \) are integers, \( b +c \) must be integer, but 1.97 is not. Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, the system has no solution.

Therefore, the number of real solutions is zero.

But wait, this seems to be the case. But let me check if I added the equations correctly.

Equation 1: a + b + u - w =2.98

Equation 3: b + c + v - u =5.01

Sum: a + b + u - w + b + c + v - u =2.98 +5.01

Simplifies to: a + 2b + c + v - w =7.99

Equation 2: a - c + v - w =4.05

Subtract equation 2: (a +2b + c + v -w) - (a -c +v -w) =7.99 -4.05

Left side: a +2b +c +v -w -a +c -v +w =2b +2c

Right side:3.94

Thus, 2b +2c=3.94 =&gt; b +c=1.97, which is impossible because b and c are integers. Therefore, the system is inconsistent, no solutions.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check again for possible miscalculations.

Wait, the problem says &quot;real solutions&quot;, but in the equations, floor and fractional parts are involved, so variables x, y, z are real numbers, but with their floor and fractional parts.

But according to the above, the equations lead to a contradiction, so there&#x27;s no solution.

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the thought process. Let me check with different approaches.

Suppose I take equations:

1. \( a + b + u - w =2.98 \)

2. \( a - c + v - w =4.05 \)

3. \( b + c + v - u =5.01 \)

Let me try to express variables in terms of others.

From equation 1: \( a + b =2.98 - u + w \). Since \( a, b \) integers, 2.98 -u +w must be integer. Since u, w are fractional parts, 0 ≤ u, w &lt;1, so 2.98 - u + w ∈ (2.98 -1 +0, 2.98 -0 +1) = (1.98, 3.98). Thus, possible integer values 2 or3.

Similarly, from equation3: \( b +c =5.01 -v +u \). 5.01 -v +u ∈ (5.01 -1 +0, 5.01 -0 +1)= (4.01,6.01). So integers 5 or6.

From equation2: \( a -c =4.05 -v +w \). 4.05 -v +w ∈ (4.05 -1 +0,4.05 -0 +1)= (3.05,5.05). So integers4 or5.

So possible combinations:

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

So total 8 cases. Let&#x27;s check each.

Case A: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4, subtract the equations: (a -c) - (a +b)=4 -2 =&gt; -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But from b +c=5, contradiction. So invalid.

Case B: a + b=2, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=2 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; -(c + b)=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case C: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=2 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b= -2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case D: a + b=2, b +c=6, a -c=5

Similarly, a -c=5 and a +b=2. Subtract: -c -b=3 =&gt; c + b=-3. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case E: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case F: a + b=3, b +c=5, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=5. Contradiction.

Case G: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=4

From a + b=3 and a -c=4: subtract: -c -b=1 =&gt; -(c + b)=1 =&gt; c + b=-1. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

Case H: a + b=3, b +c=6, a -c=5

From a + b=3 and a -c=5: subtract: -c -b=2 =&gt; -(c + b)=2 =&gt; c + b=-2. But c + b=6. Contradiction.

All cases lead to contradictions. Hence, there are no solutions. Therefore, the system of equations has no real solutions. Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
x + \lfloor y \rfloor - \{z\} = 2.98, \\
\lfloor x \rfloor + \{y\} - z = 4.05, \\
-\{x\} + y + \lfloor z \rfloor = 5.01,
\end{cases}
\]
we start by expressing each variable in terms of its integer and fractional parts. Let \( \lfloor x \rfloor = a \), \( \lfloor y \rfloor = b \), \( \lfloor z \rfloor = c \), and \( \{x\} = u \), \( \{y\} = v \), \( \{z\} = w \), where \( a, b, c \) are integers and \( u, v, w \) are fractional parts such that \( 0 \leq u, v, w &lt; 1 \).

Substituting these into the equations, we get:
1. \( a + b + u - w = 2.98 \)
2. \( a - c + v - w = 4.05 \)
3. \( b + c + v - u = 5.01 \)

We analyze the possible integer values for \( a + b \), \( b + c \), and \( a - c \):
- From equation 1, \( a + b \) must be 2 or 3.
- From equation 3, \( b + c \) must be 5 or 6.
- From equation 2, \( a - c \) must be 4 or 5.

We check all possible combinations of these integer values and find that each leads to a contradiction. For example, adding equations 1 and 3 and subtracting equation 2 results in:
\[
2b + 2c = 3.94 \implies b + c = 1.97
\]
which is impossible since \( b \) and \( c \) are integers. Similarly, other combinations also lead to contradictions.

Thus, the system of equations is inconsistent and has no real solutions. The number of real solutions is:
\[
\boxed{0}
