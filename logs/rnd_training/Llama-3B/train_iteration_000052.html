Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to show that the integral of f times e^{-nx} from 0 to 1 goes to zero as n approaches infinity. Hmm, let&#x27;s start by recalling that f is in L^1([0,1]), which means that the integral of |f(x)| from 0 to 1 is finite. The function χ_n here is e^{-nx}, and we&#x27;re taking the inner product of f with χ_n, which involves integrating f multiplied by the complex conjugate of χ_n over [0,1]. But since χ_n is real-valued here (assuming we&#x27;re dealing with real functions), the complex conjugate is just e^{-nx} itself. So essentially, we need to compute the limit as n goes to infinity of ∫₀¹ f(x)e^{-nx} dx.

Alright, so the problem is to show that this integral tends to zero. Let me think about possible approaches. Since f is in L^1, maybe we can use some convergence theorem, like the Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT) or the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma. Wait, the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma usually states that the Fourier coefficients of an L^1 function tend to zero. But here, the exponent is e^{-nx}, which isn&#x27;t exactly a Fourier basis function. Fourier transforms typically involve e^{-ikx} or something with imaginary exponents, but maybe there&#x27;s a similar principle here.

Alternatively, maybe we can adapt the proof technique of the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma. Let&#x27;s recall how that proof goes. For Fourier coefficients, you use the fact that trigonometric polynomials are dense in L^1, approximate f by a trigonometric polynomial, and then show that the integral over the high-frequency terms goes to zero. But here, instead of high frequencies, we have an exponential decay term. So maybe the approach would be different.

Alternatively, since e^{-nx} tends to zero pointwise for each x in (0,1] as n increases. At x=0, e^{-n*0}=1, but the point x=0 is a single point and hence measure zero. So except at x=0, e^{-nx} goes to zero. Therefore, maybe we can use the Dominated Convergence Theorem here. Let&#x27;s check the conditions.

First, for each x in [0,1], the integrand f(x)e^{-nx} converges to 0 as n→∞, except possibly at x=0. But since the set {0} has measure zero, the convergence is almost everywhere. Next, we need a dominating function. Since |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)| because e^{-nx} ≤ 1 for x ∈ [0,1] and n ≥ 0. And since f is in L^1, |f| is integrable. Therefore, by DCT, we can interchange the limit and integral, leading to the integral of the limit, which is zero. Therefore, the limit is zero.

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check. The Dominated Convergence Theorem requires that |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)|, which is integrable. So as long as f is in L^1, the dominated convergence theorem applies, so the limit of the integral is the integral of the limit. Since the limit of f(x)e^{-nx} is zero a.e., then the integral should be zero. Therefore, this seems straightforward. So maybe the answer is just applying DCT?

But sometimes when people see exponentials decaying, they might think of other approaches, like integrating by parts or something. Let&#x27;s see if that&#x27;s necessary here. For example, suppose f is smooth. Then integrating by parts might give some decay, but f is only L^1 here, so integrating by parts might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe splitting the integral into two parts: near zero and away from zero. Let me try that. Let ε be a small positive number. Then split the integral into [0, ε] and [ε, 1]. For the integral over [ε, 1], e^{-nx} ≤ e^{-nε}, so the integral over [ε,1] is bounded by e^{-nε} ∫₀¹ |f(x)| dx, which tends to zero as n→∞, since e^{-nε} decays exponentially. Then for the integral over [0, ε], we can bound it by ∫₀^ε |f(x)| dx since e^{-nx} ≤ 1. Since f is integrable, for any δ&gt;0, there exists an ε such that ∫₀^ε |f(x)| dx &lt; δ. So combining these two parts, for large n, the entire integral is less than δ + e^{-nε} ||f||_1. Since δ is arbitrary, the limit is zero. This is the approach of absolute continuity of the integral.

So, both approaches: DCT and splitting the integral, lead to the same conclusion. So maybe both are valid. But since f is in L^1, DCT is the most straightforward. However, sometimes in exams or problems, depending on the tools allowed, you might have to use more elementary methods. But in this case, since L^1 is given, DCT is applicable.

Wait, but to use DCT, we need pointwise convergence a.e. of the integrand. Here, e^{-nx} tends to zero for x in (0,1], which is a.e. on [0,1], so the product f(x)e^{-nx} tends to zero a.e. And |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)| which is integrable. Thus, by DCT, the limit is zero.

Alternatively, if the student is not comfortable with DCT, they can use the absolute continuity argument. Since f is integrable, for any δ &gt; 0, there exists ε &gt; 0 such that ∫₀^ε |f(x)| dx &lt; δ. Then, split the integral into [0, ε] and [ε, 1]. The integral over [ε, 1] is bounded by e^{-nε} ||f||_1, which goes to zero as n → ∞. The integral over [0, ε] is bounded by δ. Hence, for sufficiently large n, the entire integral is less than 2δ, which can be made arbitrarily small. Therefore, the limit is zero.

Either way, both methods work. Since the problem statement mentions f ∈ L^1([0,1]), which gives us the necessary conditions for DCT or absolute continuity. So, probably either approach is acceptable. Since the problem seems to be expecting a proof, maybe writing out the ε argument is more elementary and doesn&#x27;t require invoking DCT, which might be considered a higher-level theorem.

But given that DCT is a fundamental theorem in integration theory, and the problem is in the context of L^1 functions, it&#x27;s likely acceptable. However, to be thorough, maybe present both ideas. But in an exam setting, being concise is better.

Therefore, the answer is that since e^{-nx} → 0 a.e. on [0,1] as n → ∞, and |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)| ∈ L^1, by DCT, the integral tends to zero.

But let me check if there are any possible mistakes here. For example, suppose f has a Dirac delta at 0, but f is in L^1([0,1]), which doesn&#x27;t allow Dirac deltas. So f is an L^1 function, so no problem. Even if f has a blow-up at 0, as long as it&#x27;s integrable, the DCT applies. For instance, if f(x) = 1/x^{1/2}, which is integrable on [0,1], then e^{-nx} * 1/x^{1/2} still tends to zero a.e., and dominated by 1/x^{1/2} which is in L^1. So DCT still applies.

Alternatively, if we want to use the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma analogy, in Fourier analysis, the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma says that the Fourier transform of an L^1 function vanishes at infinity. Here, the exponential e^{-nx} is not oscillatory, but decaying. However, the principle that the integrand becomes highly oscillatory or decays to zero except on a set of measure zero might lead the integral to go to zero.

But in this case, since it&#x27;s a real exponential decay, not oscillations, the mechanism is different. In Fourier, the oscillations cause cancellation, but here, the decay causes the integrand to be small except near zero, but near zero, the integral can be made small due to absolute continuity.

But regardless of the interpretation, the conclusion is the same. Therefore, the answer should be that by the Dominated Convergence Theorem, the integral tends to zero.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

To show that \( \lim_{n \to \infty} (f, \chi_n) = 0 \) where \( (f, \chi_n) = \int_{[0,1]} f(x) e^{-nx} \, dx \) and \( f \in L^1([0,1]) \), we can use the Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT).

1. **Pointwise Convergence**: For each \( x \in (0,1] \), \( e^{-nx} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). At \( x = 0 \), \( e^{-n \cdot 0} = 1 \), but the set \(\{0\}\) has measure zero. Therefore, \( e^{-nx} \to 0 \) almost everywhere on \([0,1]\).

2. **Dominating Function**: The absolute value of the integrand \( |f(x) e^{-nx}| \) is bounded by \( |f(x)| \), which is integrable since \( f \in L^1([0,1]) \).

By the Dominated Convergence Theorem, we can interchange the limit and the integral:
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{[0,1]} f(x) e^{-nx} \, dx = \int_{[0,1]} \lim_{n \to \infty} f(x) e^{-nx} \, dx = \int_{[0,1]} 0 \, dx = 0.
\]

Thus, the limit is \(\boxed{0}\).          </p>

So as long as f is in L^1, the dominated convergence theorem applies, so the limit of the integral is the integral of the limit. Since the limit of f(x)e^{-nx} is zero a.e., then the integral should be zero. Therefore, this seems straightforward. So maybe the answer is just applying DCT?

But sometimes when people see exponentials decaying, they might think of other approaches, like integrating by parts or something. Let&#x27;s see if that&#x27;s necessary here. For example, suppose f is smooth. Then integrating by parts might give some decay, but f is only L^1 here, so integrating by parts might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe splitting the integral into two parts: near zero and away from zero. Let me try that. Let ε be a small positive number. Then split the integral into [0, ε] and [ε, 1]. For the integral over [ε, 1], e^{-nx} ≤ e^{-nε}, so the integral over [ε,1] is bounded by e^{-nε} ∫₀¹ |f(x)| dx, which tends to zero as n→∞, since e^{-nε} decays exponentially. Then for the integral over [0, ε], we can bound it by ∫₀^ε |f(x)| dx since e^{-nx} ≤ 1. Since f is integrable, for any δ&gt;0, there exists an ε such that ∫₀^ε |f(x)| dx &lt; δ. So combining these two parts, for large n, the entire integral is less than δ + e^{-nε} ||f||_1. Since δ is arbitrary, the limit is zero. This is the approach of absolute continuity of the integral.

So, both approaches: DCT and splitting the integral, lead to the same conclusion. So maybe both are valid. But since f is in L^1, DCT is the most straightforward. However, sometimes in exams or problems, depending on the tools allowed, you might have to use more elementary methods. But in this case, since L^1 is given, DCT is applicable.

Wait, but to use DCT, we need pointwise convergence a.e. of the integrand. Here, e^{-nx} tends to zero for x in (0,1], which is a.e. on [0,1], so the product f(x)e^{-nx} tends to zero a.e. And |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)| which is integrable. Thus, by DCT, the limit is zero.

Alternatively, if the student is not comfortable with DCT, they can use the absolute continuity argument. Since f is integrable, for any δ &gt; 0, there exists ε &gt; 0 such that ∫₀^ε |f(x)| dx &lt; δ. Then, split the integral into [0, ε] and [ε, 1]. The integral over [ε, 1] is bounded by e^{-nε} ||f||_1, which goes to zero as n → ∞. The integral over [0, ε] is bounded by δ. Hence, for sufficiently large n, the entire integral is less than 2δ, which can be made arbitrarily small. Therefore, the limit is zero.

Either way, both methods work. Since the problem statement mentions f ∈ L^1([0,1]), which gives us the necessary conditions for DCT or absolute continuity. So, probably either approach is acceptable. Since the problem seems to be expecting a proof, maybe writing out the ε argument is more elementary and doesn&#x27;t require invoking DCT, which might be considered a higher-level theorem.

But given that DCT is a fundamental theorem in integration theory, and the problem is in the context of L^1 functions, it&#x27;s likely acceptable. However, to be thorough, maybe present both ideas. But in an exam setting, being concise is better.

Therefore, the answer is that since e^{-nx} → 0 a.e. on [0,1] as n → ∞, and |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)| ∈ L^1, by DCT, the integral tends to zero.

But let me check if there are any possible mistakes here. For example, suppose f has a Dirac delta at 0, but f is in L^1([0,1]), which doesn&#x27;t allow Dirac deltas. So f is an L^1 function, so no problem. Even if f has a blow-up at 0, as long as it&#x27;s integrable, the DCT applies. For instance, if f(x) = 1/x^{1/2}, which is integrable on [0,1], then e^{-nx} * 1/x^{1/2} still tends to zero a.e., and dominated by 1/x^{1/2} which is in L^1. So DCT still applies.

Alternatively, if we want to use the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma analogy, in Fourier analysis, the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma says that the Fourier transform of an L^1 function vanishes at infinity. Here, the exponential e^{-nx} is not oscillatory, but decaying. However, the principle that the integrand becomes highly oscillatory or decays to zero except on a set of measure zero might lead the integral to go to zero.

But in this case, since it&#x27;s a real exponential decay, not oscillations, the mechanism is different. In Fourier, the oscillations cause cancellation, but here, the decay causes the integrand to be small except near zero, but near zero, the integral can be made small due to absolute continuity.

But regardless of the interpretation, the conclusion is the same. Therefore, the answer should be that by the Dominated Convergence Theorem, the integral tends to zero.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}

To show that \( \lim_{n \to \infty} (f, \chi_n) = 0 \) where \( (f, \chi_n) = \int_{[0,1]} f(x) e^{-nx} \, dx \) and \( f \in L^1([0,1]) \), we can use the Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT).

1. **Pointwise Convergence**: For each \( x \in (0,1] \), \( e^{-nx} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). At \( x = 0 \), \( e^{-n \cdot 0} = 1 \), but the set \(\{0\}\) has measure zero. Therefore, \( e^{-nx} \to 0 \) almost everywhere on \([0,1]\).

2. **Dominating Function**: The absolute value of the integrand \( |f(x) e^{-nx}| \) is bounded by \( |f(x)| \), which is integrable since \( f \in L^1([0,1]) \).

By the Dominated Convergence Theorem, we can interchange the limit and the integral:
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{[0,1]} f(x) e^{-nx} \, dx = \int_{[0,1]} \lim_{n \to \infty} f(x) e^{-nx} \, dx = \int_{[0,1]} 0 \, dx = 0.
\]

Thus, the limit is \(\boxed{0}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to show that the integral of f times e^{-nx} from 0 to 1 goes to zero as n approaches infinity. Hmm, let&#x27;s start by recalling that f is in L^1([0,1]), which means that the integral of |f(x)| from 0 to 1 is finite. The function χ_n here is e^{-nx}, and we&#x27;re taking the inner product of f with χ_n, which involves integrating f multiplied by the complex conjugate of χ_n over [0,1]. But since χ_n is real-valued here (assuming we&#x27;re dealing with real functions), the complex conjugate is just e^{-nx} itself. So essentially, we need to compute the limit as n goes to infinity of ∫₀¹ f(x)e^{-nx} dx.

Alright, so the problem is to show that this integral tends to zero. Let me think about possible approaches. Since f is in L^1, maybe we can use some convergence theorem, like the Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT) or the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma. Wait, the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma usually states that the Fourier coefficients of an L^1 function tend to zero. But here, the exponent is e^{-nx}, which isn&#x27;t exactly a Fourier basis function. Fourier transforms typically involve e^{-ikx} or something with imaginary exponents, but maybe there&#x27;s a similar principle here.

Alternatively, maybe we can adapt the proof technique of the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma. Let&#x27;s recall how that proof goes. For Fourier coefficients, you use the fact that trigonometric polynomials are dense in L^1, approximate f by a trigonometric polynomial, and then show that the integral over the high-frequency terms goes to zero. But here, instead of high frequencies, we have an exponential decay term. So maybe the approach would be different.

Alternatively, since e^{-nx} tends to zero pointwise for each x in (0,1] as n increases. At x=0, e^{-n*0}=1, but the point x=0 is a single point and hence measure zero. So except at x=0, e^{-nx} goes to zero. Therefore, maybe we can use the Dominated Convergence Theorem here. Let&#x27;s check the conditions.

First, for each x in [0,1], the integrand f(x)e^{-nx} converges to 0 as n→∞, except possibly at x=0. But since the set {0} has measure zero, the convergence is almost everywhere. Next, we need a dominating function. Since |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)| because e^{-nx} ≤ 1 for x ∈ [0,1] and n ≥ 0. And since f is in L^1, |f| is integrable. Therefore, by DCT, we can interchange the limit and integral, leading to the integral of the limit, which is zero. Therefore, the limit is zero.

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check. The Dominated Convergence Theorem requires that |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)|, which is integrable. So as long as f is in L^1, the dominated convergence theorem applies, so the limit of the integral is the integral of the limit.

Then for the integral over [0, ε], we can bound it by ∫₀^ε |f(x)| dx since e^{-nx} ≤ 1. Since f is integrable, for any δ&gt;0, there exists an ε such that ∫₀^ε |f(x)| dx &lt; δ.

Next, we need a dominating function. Since |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)| because e^{-nx} ≤ 1 for x ∈ [0,1] and n ≥ 0. And since f is in L^1, |f| is integrable. Therefore, by DCT, we can interchange the limit and integral, leading to the integral of the limit, which is zero. Therefore, the limit is zero.

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check. The Dominated Convergence Theorem requires that |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)|, which is integrable. So as long as f is in L^1, the dominated convergence theorem applies, so the limit of the integral is the integral of the limit. Since the limit of f(x)e^{-nx} is zero a.e., then the integral should be zero. Therefore, this seems straightforward. So maybe the answer is just applying DCT?

But sometimes when people see exponentials decaying, they might think of other approaches, like integrating by parts or something. Let&#x27;s see if that&#x27;s necessary here. For example, suppose f is smooth. Then integrating by parts might give some decay, but f is only L^1 here, so integrating by parts might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe splitting the integral into two parts: near zero and away from zero. Let me try that. Let ε be a small positive number. Then split the integral into [0, ε] and [ε, 1]. For the integral over [ε, 1], e^{-nx} ≤ e^{-nε}, so the integral over [ε,1] is bounded by e^{-nε} ∫₀¹ |f(x)| dx, which tends to zero as n→∞, since e^{-nε} decays exponentially. Then for the integral over [0, ε], we can bound it by ∫₀^ε |f(x)| dx since e^{-nx} ≤ 1. Since f is integrable, for any δ&gt;0, there exists an ε such that ∫₀^ε |f(x)| dx &lt; δ. So combining these two parts, for large n, the entire integral is less than δ + e^{-nε} ||f||_1. Since δ is arbitrary, the limit is zero. This is the approach of absolute continuity of the integral.

So, both approaches: DCT and splitting the integral, lead to the same conclusion. So maybe both are valid. But since f is in L^1, DCT is the most straightforward. However, sometimes in exams or problems, depending on the tools allowed, you might have to use more elementary methods. But in this case, since L^1 is given, DCT is applicable.

Wait, but to use DCT, we need pointwise convergence a.e. of the integrand. Here, e^{-nx} tends to zero for x in (0,1], which is a.e. on [0,1], so the product f(x)e^{-nx} tends to zero a.e. And |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)| which is integrable. Thus, by DCT, the limit is zero.

Alternatively, if the student is not comfortable with DCT, they can use the absolute continuity argument. Since f is integrable, for any δ &gt; 0, there exists ε &gt; 0 such that ∫₀^ε |f(x)| dx &lt; δ. Then, split the integral into [0, ε] and [ε, 1]. The integral over [ε, 1] is bounded by e^{-nε} ||f||_1, which goes to zero as n → ∞. The integral over [0, ε] is bounded by δ. Hence, for sufficiently large n, the entire integral is less than 2δ, which can be made arbitrarily small. Therefore, the limit is zero.

Either way, both methods work. Since the problem statement mentions f ∈ L^1([0,1]), which gives us the necessary conditions for DCT or absolute continuity. So, probably either approach is acceptable. Since the problem seems to be expecting a proof, maybe writing out the ε argument is more elementary and doesn&#x27;t require invoking DCT, which might be considered a higher-level theorem.

But given that DCT is a fundamental theorem in integration theory, and the problem is in the context of L^1 functions, it&#x27;s likely acceptable. However, to be thorough, maybe present both ideas. But in an exam setting, being concise is better.

Therefore, the answer is that since e^{-nx} → 0 a.e. on [0,1] as n → ∞, and |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)| ∈ L^1, by DCT, the integral tends to zero.

But let me check if there are any possible mistakes here. For example, suppose f has a Dirac delta at 0, but f is in L^1([0,1]), which doesn&#x27;t allow Dirac deltas. So f is an L^1 function, so no problem. Even if f has a blow-up at 0, as long as it&#x27;s integrable, the DCT applies. For instance, if f(x) = 1/x^{1/2}, which is integrable on [0,1], then e^{-nx} * 1/x^{1/2} still tends to zero a.e., and dominated by 1/x^{1/2} which is in L^1. So DCT still applies.

Alternatively, if we want to use the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma analogy, in Fourier analysis, the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma says that the Fourier transform of an L^1 function vanishes at infinity. Here, the exponential e^{-nx} is not oscillatory, but decaying. However, the principle that the integrand becomes highly oscillatory or decays to zero except on a set of measure zero might lead the integral to go to zero.

But in this case, since it&#x27;s a real exponential decay, not oscillations, the mechanism is different. In Fourier, the oscillations cause cancellation, but here, the decay causes the integrand to be small except near zero, but near zero, the integral can be made small due to absolute continuity.

But regardless of the interpretation, the conclusion is the same. Therefore, the answer should be that by the Dominated Convergence Theorem, the integral tends to zero.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}

To show that \( \lim_{n \to \infty} (f, \chi_n) = 0 \) where \( (f, \chi_n) = \int_{[0,1]} f(x) e^{-nx} \, dx \) and \( f \in L^1([0,1]) \), we can use the Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT).

1. **Pointwise Convergence**: For each \( x \in (0,1] \), \( e^{-nx} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). At \( x = 0 \), \( e^{-n \cdot 0} = 1 \), but the set \(\{0\}\) has measure zero. Therefore, \( e^{-nx} \to 0 \) almost everywhere on \([0,1]\).

2. **Dominating Function**: The absolute value of the integrand \( |f(x) e^{-nx}| \) is bounded by \( |f(x)| \), which is integrable since \( f \in L^1([0,1]) \).

By the Dominated Convergence Theorem, we can interchange the limit and the integral:
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{[0,1]} f(x) e^{-nx} \, dx = \int_{[0,1]} \lim_{n \to \infty} f(x) e^{-nx} \, dx = \int_{[0,1]} 0 \, dx = 0.
\]

Thus, the limit is \(\boxed{0}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to show that the integral of f times e^{-nx} from 0 to 1 goes to zero as n approaches infinity. Hmm, let&#x27;s start by recalling that f is in L^1([0,1]), which means that the integral of |f(x)| from 0 to 1 is finite. The function χ_n here is e^{-nx}, and we&#x27;re taking the inner product of f with χ_n, which involves integrating f multiplied by the complex conjugate of χ_n over [0,1]. But since χ_n is real-valued here (assuming we&#x27;re dealing with real functions), the complex conjugate is just e^{-nx} itself. So essentially, we need to compute the limit as n goes to infinity of ∫₀¹ f(x)e^{-nx} dx.

Alright, so the problem is to show that this integral tends to zero. Let me think about possible approaches. Since f is in L^1, maybe we can use some convergence theorem, like the Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT) or the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma. Wait, the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma usually states that the Fourier coefficients of an L^1 function tend to zero. But here, the exponent is e^{-nx}, which isn&#x27;t exactly a Fourier basis function. Fourier transforms typically involve e^{-ikx} or something with imaginary exponents, but maybe there&#x27;s a similar principle here.

Alternatively, maybe we can adapt the proof technique of the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma. Let&#x27;s recall how that proof goes. For Fourier coefficients, you use the fact that trigonometric polynomials are dense in L^1, approximate f by a trigonometric polynomial, and then show that the integral over the high-frequency terms goes to zero. But here, instead of high frequencies, we have an exponential decay term. So maybe the approach would be different.

Alternatively, since e^{-nx} tends to zero pointwise for each x in (0,1] as n increases. At x=0, e^{-n*0}=1, but the point x=0 is a single point and hence measure zero. So except at x=0, e^{-nx} goes to zero. Therefore, maybe we can use the Dominated Convergence Theorem here. Let&#x27;s check the conditions.

First, for each x in [0,1], the integrand f(x)e^{-nx} converges to 0 as n→∞, except possibly at x=0. But since the set {0} has measure zero, the convergence is almost everywhere. Next, we need a dominating function. Since |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)| because e^{-nx} ≤ 1 for x ∈ [0,1] and n ≥ 0. And since f is in L^1, |f| is integrable.

But here, instead of high frequencies, we have an exponential decay term. So maybe the approach would be different.

Alternatively, since e^{-nx} tends to zero pointwise for each x in (0,1] as n increases. At x=0, e^{-n*0}=1, but the point x=0 is a single point and hence measure zero. So except at x=0, e^{-nx} goes to zero. Therefore, maybe we can use the Dominated Convergence Theorem here. Let&#x27;s check the conditions.

First, for each x in [0,1], the integrand f(x)e^{-nx} converges to 0 as n→∞, except possibly at x=0. But since the set {0} has measure zero, the convergence is almost everywhere. Next, we need a dominating function. Since |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)| because e^{-nx} ≤ 1 for x ∈ [0,1] and n ≥ 0. And since f is in L^1, |f| is integrable. Therefore, by DCT, we can interchange the limit and integral, leading to the integral of the limit, which is zero. Therefore, the limit is zero.

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check. The Dominated Convergence Theorem requires that |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)|, which is integrable. So as long as f is in L^1, the dominated convergence theorem applies, so the limit of the integral is the integral of the limit. Since the limit of f(x)e^{-nx} is zero a.e., then the integral should be zero. Therefore, this seems straightforward. So maybe the answer is just applying DCT?

But sometimes when people see exponentials decaying, they might think of other approaches, like integrating by parts or something. Let&#x27;s see if that&#x27;s necessary here. For example, suppose f is smooth. Then integrating by parts might give some decay, but f is only L^1 here, so integrating by parts might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe splitting the integral into two parts: near zero and away from zero. Let me try that. Let ε be a small positive number. Then split the integral into [0, ε] and [ε, 1]. For the integral over [ε, 1], e^{-nx} ≤ e^{-nε}, so the integral over [ε,1] is bounded by e^{-nε} ∫₀¹ |f(x)| dx, which tends to zero as n→∞, since e^{-nε} decays exponentially. Then for the integral over [0, ε], we can bound it by ∫₀^ε |f(x)| dx since e^{-nx} ≤ 1. Since f is integrable, for any δ&gt;0, there exists an ε such that ∫₀^ε |f(x)| dx &lt; δ. So combining these two parts, for large n, the entire integral is less than δ + e^{-nε} ||f||_1. Since δ is arbitrary, the limit is zero. This is the approach of absolute continuity of the integral.

So, both approaches: DCT and splitting the integral, lead to the same conclusion. So maybe both are valid. But since f is in L^1, DCT is the most straightforward. However, sometimes in exams or problems, depending on the tools allowed, you might have to use more elementary methods. But in this case, since L^1 is given, DCT is applicable.

Wait, but to use DCT, we need pointwise convergence a.e. of the integrand. Here, e^{-nx} tends to zero for x in (0,1], which is a.e. on [0,1], so the product f(x)e^{-nx} tends to zero a.e. And |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)| which is integrable. Thus, by DCT, the limit is zero.

Alternatively, if the student is not comfortable with DCT, they can use the absolute continuity argument. Since f is integrable, for any δ &gt; 0, there exists ε &gt; 0 such that ∫₀^ε |f(x)| dx &lt; δ. Then, split the integral into [0, ε] and [ε, 1]. The integral over [ε, 1] is bounded by e^{-nε} ||f||_1, which goes to zero as n → ∞. The integral over [0, ε] is bounded by δ. Hence, for sufficiently large n, the entire integral is less than 2δ, which can be made arbitrarily small. Therefore, the limit is zero.

Either way, both methods work. Since the problem statement mentions f ∈ L^1([0,1]), which gives us the necessary conditions for DCT or absolute continuity. So, probably either approach is acceptable. Since the problem seems to be expecting a proof, maybe writing out the ε argument is more elementary and doesn&#x27;t require invoking DCT, which might be considered a higher-level theorem.

But given that DCT is a fundamental theorem in integration theory, and the problem is in the context of L^1 functions, it&#x27;s likely acceptable. However, to be thorough, maybe present both ideas. But in an exam setting, being concise is better.

Therefore, the answer is that since e^{-nx} → 0 a.e. on [0,1] as n → ∞, and |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)| ∈ L^1, by DCT, the integral tends to zero.

But let me check if there are any possible mistakes here. For example, suppose f has a Dirac delta at 0, but f is in L^1([0,1]), which doesn&#x27;t allow Dirac deltas. So f is an L^1 function, so no problem. Even if f has a blow-up at 0, as long as it&#x27;s integrable, the DCT applies. For instance, if f(x) = 1/x^{1/2}, which is integrable on [0,1], then e^{-nx} * 1/x^{1/2} still tends to zero a.e., and dominated by 1/x^{1/2} which is in L^1. So DCT still applies.

Alternatively, if we want to use the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma analogy, in Fourier analysis, the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma says that the Fourier transform of an L^1 function vanishes at infinity. Here, the exponential e^{-nx} is not oscillatory, but decaying. However, the principle that the integrand becomes highly oscillatory or decays to zero except on a set of measure zero might lead the integral to go to zero.

But in this case, since it&#x27;s a real exponential decay, not oscillations, the mechanism is different. In Fourier, the oscillations cause cancellation, but here, the decay causes the integrand to be small except near zero, but near zero, the integral can be made small due to absolute continuity.

But regardless of the interpretation, the conclusion is the same. Therefore, the answer should be that by the Dominated Convergence Theorem, the integral tends to zero.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}

To show that \( \lim_{n \to \infty} (f, \chi_n) = 0 \) where \( (f, \chi_n) = \int_{[0,1]} f(x) e^{-nx} \, dx \) and \( f \in L^1([0,1]) \), we can use the Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT).

1. **Pointwise Convergence**: For each \( x \in (0,1] \), \( e^{-nx} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). At \( x = 0 \), \( e^{-n \cdot 0} = 1 \), but the set \(\{0\}\) has measure zero. Therefore, \( e^{-nx} \to 0 \) almost everywhere on \([0,1]\).

2. **Dominating Function**: The absolute value of the integrand \( |f(x) e^{-nx}| \) is bounded by \( |f(x)| \), which is integrable since \( f \in L^1([0,1]) \).

By the Dominated Convergence Theorem, we can interchange the limit and the integral:
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{[0,1]} f(x) e^{-nx} \, dx = \int_{[0,1]} \lim_{n \to \infty} f(x) e^{-nx} \, dx = \int_{[0,1]} 0 \, dx = 0.
\]

Thus, the limit is \(\boxed{0}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to show that the integral of f times e^{-nx} from 0 to 1 goes to zero as n approaches infinity. Hmm, let&#x27;s start by recalling that f is in L^1([0,1]), which means that the integral of |f(x)| from 0 to 1 is finite. The function χ_n here is e^{-nx}, and we&#x27;re taking the inner product of f with χ_n, which involves integrating f multiplied by the complex conjugate of χ_n over [0,1]. But since χ_n is real-valued here (assuming we&#x27;re dealing with real functions), the complex conjugate is just e^{-nx} itself. So essentially, we need to compute the limit as n goes to infinity of ∫₀¹ f(x)e^{-nx} dx.

Alright, so the problem is to show that this integral tends to zero. Let me think about possible approaches. Since f is in L^1, maybe we can use some convergence theorem, like the Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT) or the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma. Wait, the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma usually states that the Fourier coefficients of an L^1 function tend to zero. But here, the exponent is e^{-nx}, which isn&#x27;t exactly a Fourier basis function. Fourier transforms typically involve e^{-ikx} or something with imaginary exponents, but maybe there&#x27;s a similar principle here.

Wait, the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma usually states that the Fourier coefficients of an L^1 function tend to zero. But here, the exponent is e^{-nx}, which isn&#x27;t exactly a Fourier basis function. Fourier transforms typically involve e^{-ikx} or something with imaginary exponents, but maybe there&#x27;s a similar principle here.

Alternatively, maybe we can adapt the proof technique of the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma. Let&#x27;s recall how that proof goes. For Fourier coefficients, you use the fact that trigonometric polynomials are dense in L^1, approximate f by a trigonometric polynomial, and then show that the integral over the high-frequency terms goes to zero. But here, instead of high frequencies, we have an exponential decay term. So maybe the approach would be different.

Alternatively, since e^{-nx} tends to zero pointwise for each x in (0,1] as n increases. At x=0, e^{-n*0}=1, but the point x=0 is a single point and hence measure zero. So except at x=0, e^{-nx} goes to zero. Therefore, maybe we can use the Dominated Convergence Theorem here. Let&#x27;s check the conditions.

First, for each x in [0,1], the integrand f(x)e^{-nx} converges to 0 as n→∞, except possibly at x=0. But since the set {0} has measure zero, the convergence is almost everywhere. Next, we need a dominating function. Since |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)| because e^{-nx} ≤ 1 for x ∈ [0,1] and n ≥ 0. And since f is in L^1, |f| is integrable. Therefore, by DCT, we can interchange the limit and integral, leading to the integral of the limit, which is zero. Therefore, the limit is zero.

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check. The Dominated Convergence Theorem requires that |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)|, which is integrable. So as long as f is in L^1, the dominated convergence theorem applies, so the limit of the integral is the integral of the limit. Since the limit of f(x)e^{-nx} is zero a.e., then the integral should be zero. Therefore, this seems straightforward. So maybe the answer is just applying DCT?

But sometimes when people see exponentials decaying, they might think of other approaches, like integrating by parts or something. Let&#x27;s see if that&#x27;s necessary here. For example, suppose f is smooth. Then integrating by parts might give some decay, but f is only L^1 here, so integrating by parts might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe splitting the integral into two parts: near zero and away from zero. Let me try that. Let ε be a small positive number. Then split the integral into [0, ε] and [ε, 1]. For the integral over [ε, 1], e^{-nx} ≤ e^{-nε}, so the integral over [ε,1] is bounded by e^{-nε} ∫₀¹ |f(x)| dx, which tends to zero as n→∞, since e^{-nε} decays exponentially. Then for the integral over [0, ε], we can bound it by ∫₀^ε |f(x)| dx since e^{-nx} ≤ 1. Since f is integrable, for any δ&gt;0, there exists an ε such that ∫₀^ε |f(x)| dx &lt; δ. So combining these two parts, for large n, the entire integral is less than δ + e^{-nε} ||f||_1. Since δ is arbitrary, the limit is zero. This is the approach of absolute continuity of the integral.

So, both approaches: DCT and splitting the integral, lead to the same conclusion. So maybe both are valid. But since f is in L^1, DCT is the most straightforward. However, sometimes in exams or problems, depending on the tools allowed, you might have to use more elementary methods. But in this case, since L^1 is given, DCT is applicable.

Wait, but to use DCT, we need pointwise convergence a.e. of the integrand. Here, e^{-nx} tends to zero for x in (0,1], which is a.e. on [0,1], so the product f(x)e^{-nx} tends to zero a.e. And |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)| which is integrable. Thus, by DCT, the limit is zero.

Alternatively, if the student is not comfortable with DCT, they can use the absolute continuity argument. Since f is integrable, for any δ &gt; 0, there exists ε &gt; 0 such that ∫₀^ε |f(x)| dx &lt; δ. Then, split the integral into [0, ε] and [ε, 1]. The integral over [ε, 1] is bounded by e^{-nε} ||f||_1, which goes to zero as n → ∞. The integral over [0, ε] is bounded by δ. Hence, for sufficiently large n, the entire integral is less than 2δ, which can be made arbitrarily small. Therefore, the limit is zero.

Either way, both methods work. Since the problem statement mentions f ∈ L^1([0,1]), which gives us the necessary conditions for DCT or absolute continuity. So, probably either approach is acceptable. Since the problem seems to be expecting a proof, maybe writing out the ε argument is more elementary and doesn&#x27;t require invoking DCT, which might be considered a higher-level theorem.

But given that DCT is a fundamental theorem in integration theory, and the problem is in the context of L^1 functions, it&#x27;s likely acceptable. However, to be thorough, maybe present both ideas. But in an exam setting, being concise is better.

Therefore, the answer is that since e^{-nx} → 0 a.e. on [0,1] as n → ∞, and |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)| ∈ L^1, by DCT, the integral tends to zero.

But let me check if there are any possible mistakes here. For example, suppose f has a Dirac delta at 0, but f is in L^1([0,1]), which doesn&#x27;t allow Dirac deltas. So f is an L^1 function, so no problem. Even if f has a blow-up at 0, as long as it&#x27;s integrable, the DCT applies. For instance, if f(x) = 1/x^{1/2}, which is integrable on [0,1], then e^{-nx} * 1/x^{1/2} still tends to zero a.e., and dominated by 1/x^{1/2} which is in L^1. So DCT still applies.

Alternatively, if we want to use the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma analogy, in Fourier analysis, the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma says that the Fourier transform of an L^1 function vanishes at infinity. Here, the exponential e^{-nx} is not oscillatory, but decaying. However, the principle that the integrand becomes highly oscillatory or decays to zero except on a set of measure zero might lead the integral to go to zero.

But in this case, since it&#x27;s a real exponential decay, not oscillations, the mechanism is different. In Fourier, the oscillations cause cancellation, but here, the decay causes the integrand to be small except near zero, but near zero, the integral can be made small due to absolute continuity.

But regardless of the interpretation, the conclusion is the same. Therefore, the answer should be that by the Dominated Convergence Theorem, the integral tends to zero.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}

To show that \( \lim_{n \to \infty} (f, \chi_n) = 0 \) where \( (f, \chi_n) = \int_{[0,1]} f(x) e^{-nx} \, dx \) and \( f \in L^1([0,1]) \), we can use the Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT).

1. **Pointwise Convergence**: For each \( x \in (0,1] \), \( e^{-nx} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). At \( x = 0 \), \( e^{-n \cdot 0} = 1 \), but the set \(\{0\}\) has measure zero. Therefore, \( e^{-nx} \to 0 \) almost everywhere on \([0,1]\).

2. **Dominating Function**: The absolute value of the integrand \( |f(x) e^{-nx}| \) is bounded by \( |f(x)| \), which is integrable since \( f \in L^1([0,1]) \).

By the Dominated Convergence Theorem, we can interchange the limit and the integral:
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{[0,1]} f(x) e^{-nx} \, dx = \int_{[0,1]} \lim_{n \to \infty} f(x) e^{-nx} \, dx = \int_{[0,1]} 0 \, dx = 0.
\]

Thus, the limit is \(\boxed{0}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to show that the integral of f times e^{-nx} from 0 to 1 goes to zero as n approaches infinity. Hmm, let&#x27;s start by recalling that f is in L^1([0,1]), which means that the integral of |f(x)| from 0 to 1 is finite. The function χ_n here is e^{-nx}, and we&#x27;re taking the inner product of f with χ_n, which involves integrating f multiplied by the complex conjugate of χ_n over [0,1]. But since χ_n is real-valued here (assuming we&#x27;re dealing with real functions), the complex conjugate is just e^{-nx} itself. So essentially, we need to compute the limit as n goes to infinity of ∫₀¹ f(x)e^{-nx} dx.

But since χ_n is real-valued here (assuming we&#x27;re dealing with real functions), the complex conjugate is just e^{-nx} itself. So essentially, we need to compute the limit as n goes to infinity of ∫₀¹ f(x)e^{-nx} dx.

Alright, so the problem is to show that this integral tends to zero. Let me think about possible approaches. Since f is in L^1, maybe we can use some convergence theorem, like the Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT) or the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma. Wait, the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma usually states that the Fourier coefficients of an L^1 function tend to zero. But here, the exponent is e^{-nx}, which isn&#x27;t exactly a Fourier basis function. Fourier transforms typically involve e^{-ikx} or something with imaginary exponents, but maybe there&#x27;s a similar principle here.

Alternatively, maybe we can adapt the proof technique of the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma. Let&#x27;s recall how that proof goes. For Fourier coefficients, you use the fact that trigonometric polynomials are dense in L^1, approximate f by a trigonometric polynomial, and then show that the integral over the high-frequency terms goes to zero. But here, instead of high frequencies, we have an exponential decay term. So maybe the approach would be different.

Alternatively, since e^{-nx} tends to zero pointwise for each x in (0,1] as n increases. At x=0, e^{-n*0}=1, but the point x=0 is a single point and hence measure zero. So except at x=0, e^{-nx} goes to zero. Therefore, maybe we can use the Dominated Convergence Theorem here. Let&#x27;s check the conditions.

First, for each x in [0,1], the integrand f(x)e^{-nx} converges to 0 as n→∞, except possibly at x=0. But since the set {0} has measure zero, the convergence is almost everywhere. Next, we need a dominating function. Since |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)| because e^{-nx} ≤ 1 for x ∈ [0,1] and n ≥ 0. And since f is in L^1, |f| is integrable. Therefore, by DCT, we can interchange the limit and integral, leading to the integral of the limit, which is zero. Therefore, the limit is zero.

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check. The Dominated Convergence Theorem requires that |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)|, which is integrable. So as long as f is in L^1, the dominated convergence theorem applies, so the limit of the integral is the integral of the limit. Since the limit of f(x)e^{-nx} is zero a.e., then the integral should be zero. Therefore, this seems straightforward. So maybe the answer is just applying DCT?

But sometimes when people see exponentials decaying, they might think of other approaches, like integrating by parts or something. Let&#x27;s see if that&#x27;s necessary here. For example, suppose f is smooth. Then integrating by parts might give some decay, but f is only L^1 here, so integrating by parts might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe splitting the integral into two parts: near zero and away from zero. Let me try that. Let ε be a small positive number. Then split the integral into [0, ε] and [ε, 1]. For the integral over [ε, 1], e^{-nx} ≤ e^{-nε}, so the integral over [ε,1] is bounded by e^{-nε} ∫₀¹ |f(x)| dx, which tends to zero as n→∞, since e^{-nε} decays exponentially. Then for the integral over [0, ε], we can bound it by ∫₀^ε |f(x)| dx since e^{-nx} ≤ 1. Since f is integrable, for any δ&gt;0, there exists an ε such that ∫₀^ε |f(x)| dx &lt; δ. So combining these two parts, for large n, the entire integral is less than δ + e^{-nε} ||f||_1. Since δ is arbitrary, the limit is zero. This is the approach of absolute continuity of the integral.

So, both approaches: DCT and splitting the integral, lead to the same conclusion. So maybe both are valid. But since f is in L^1, DCT is the most straightforward. However, sometimes in exams or problems, depending on the tools allowed, you might have to use more elementary methods. But in this case, since L^1 is given, DCT is applicable.

Wait, but to use DCT, we need pointwise convergence a.e. of the integrand. Here, e^{-nx} tends to zero for x in (0,1], which is a.e. on [0,1], so the product f(x)e^{-nx} tends to zero a.e. And |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)| which is integrable. Thus, by DCT, the limit is zero.

Alternatively, if the student is not comfortable with DCT, they can use the absolute continuity argument. Since f is integrable, for any δ &gt; 0, there exists ε &gt; 0 such that ∫₀^ε |f(x)| dx &lt; δ. Then, split the integral into [0, ε] and [ε, 1]. The integral over [ε, 1] is bounded by e^{-nε} ||f||_1, which goes to zero as n → ∞. The integral over [0, ε] is bounded by δ. Hence, for sufficiently large n, the entire integral is less than 2δ, which can be made arbitrarily small. Therefore, the limit is zero.

Either way, both methods work. Since the problem statement mentions f ∈ L^1([0,1]), which gives us the necessary conditions for DCT or absolute continuity. So, probably either approach is acceptable. Since the problem seems to be expecting a proof, maybe writing out the ε argument is more elementary and doesn&#x27;t require invoking DCT, which might be considered a higher-level theorem.

But given that DCT is a fundamental theorem in integration theory, and the problem is in the context of L^1 functions, it&#x27;s likely acceptable. However, to be thorough, maybe present both ideas. But in an exam setting, being concise is better.

Therefore, the answer is that since e^{-nx} → 0 a.e. on [0,1] as n → ∞, and |f(x)e^{-nx}| ≤ |f(x)| ∈ L^1, by DCT, the integral tends to zero.

But let me check if there are any possible mistakes here. For example, suppose f has a Dirac delta at 0, but f is in L^1([0,1]), which doesn&#x27;t allow Dirac deltas. So f is an L^1 function, so no problem. Even if f has a blow-up at 0, as long as it&#x27;s integrable, the DCT applies. For instance, if f(x) = 1/x^{1/2}, which is integrable on [0,1], then e^{-nx} * 1/x^{1/2} still tends to zero a.e., and dominated by 1/x^{1/2} which is in L^1. So DCT still applies.

Alternatively, if we want to use the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma analogy, in Fourier analysis, the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma says that the Fourier transform of an L^1 function vanishes at infinity. Here, the exponential e^{-nx} is not oscillatory, but decaying. However, the principle that the integrand becomes highly oscillatory or decays to zero except on a set of measure zero might lead the integral to go to zero.

But in this case, since it&#x27;s a real exponential decay, not oscillations, the mechanism is different. In Fourier, the oscillations cause cancellation, but here, the decay causes the integrand to be small except near zero, but near zero, the integral can be made small due to absolute continuity.

But regardless of the interpretation, the conclusion is the same. Therefore, the answer should be that by the Dominated Convergence Theorem, the integral tends to zero.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

To show that \( \lim_{n \to \infty} (f, \chi_n) = 0 \) where \( (f, \chi_n) = \int_{[0,1]} f(x) e^{-nx} \, dx \) and \( f \in L^1([0,1]) \), we can use the Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT).

1. **Pointwise Convergence**: For each \( x \in (0,1] \), \( e^{-nx} \to 0 \) as \( n \to \infty \). At \( x = 0 \), \( e^{-n \cdot 0} = 1 \), but the set \(\{0\}\) has measure zero. Therefore, \( e^{-nx} \to 0 \) almost everywhere on \([0,1]\).

2. **Dominating Function**: The absolute value of the integrand \( |f(x) e^{-nx}| \) is bounded by \( |f(x)| \), which is integrable since \( f \in L^1([0,1]) \).

By the Dominated Convergence Theorem, we can interchange the limit and the integral:
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{[0,1]} f(x) e^{-nx} \, dx = \int_{[0,1]} \lim_{n \to \infty} f(x) e^{-nx} \, dx = \int_{[0,1]} 0 \, dx = 0.
\]

Thus, the limit is \(\boxed{0}\).          </p>

Response: \boxed{Yes}          </p>

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s tackle this problem step by step. The question is: if we have a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \), and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, can we conclude that the induced map on the first homology group with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) coefficients, \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \), is also an isomorphism?

First, let me recall some basic concepts. The fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) is the group of loops based at a point in \( X \), up to homotopy. The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), which means we take \( \pi_1(X) \) and make it abelian by quotienting out the commutator subgroup. For coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is the first homology group with coefficients in the abelian group \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). I think this is equivalent to taking the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \) and then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Given that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, we should consider what happens when we pass to the abelianization. Since the abelianization is a functor, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) should also be an isomorphism. Then, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is a right-exact functor, should preserve the isomorphism because tensoring an isomorphism with any module is still an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism as well.

Wait, but hold on. The fundamental group is non-abelian. Does that affect anything? Let me think. The key point is that even though \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is just the largest abelian quotient. If \( \pi_1(f) \) is an automorphism, then it should induce an automorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is also an isomorphism. Then, since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a field (well, a ring, but a simple one), tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) over \( \mathbb{Z} \) would preserve the isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But is there any possible catch here? Let me check with an example. Take a space with a non-abelian fundamental group, say a wedge of two circles. Wait, no, the fundamental group of a wedge of two circles is the free group on two generators, which is non-abelian. If we have a map inducing an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), then the induced map on \( H_1 \) with any coefficients should also be an isomorphism. For example, if the map swaps the two circles, that would induce an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), and correspondingly on \( H_1 \), even with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Alternatively, consider a more complicated space, like a surface. Take a closed orientable surface of genus \( g \geq 2 \). Its fundamental group is non-abelian, and any homeomorphism would induce an automorphism on \( \pi_1 \), hence on \( H_1 \), and tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. So in these examples, it seems to hold.

But maybe there&#x27;s a case where the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, but the map on \( H_1 \) with coefficients isn&#x27;t? Let me think. Suppose we have a group \( G \) and an automorphism \( \phi: G \to G \). Then, the induced map on the abelianization \( G^{ab} \) is \( \phi^{ab}: G^{ab} \to G^{ab} \). If \( \phi \) is an automorphism, then \( \phi^{ab} \) must also be an automorphism. Because the kernel of the abelianization is the commutator subgroup, which is characteristic, hence preserved under automorphisms. Therefore, the induced map on \( G^{ab} \) is indeed an automorphism.

Then, since \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) = H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a flat \( \mathbb{Z} \)-module (because it&#x27;s torsion-free? Wait, no, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is torsion. Wait, flatness over \( \mathbb{Z} \) requires that the module is torsion-free, which \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not. So tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not exact. But we have that if \( f: A \to B \) is an isomorphism of abelian groups, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to B \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is also an isomorphism. Because if \( f \) is an isomorphism, then it&#x27;s a bijective homomorphism, and tensoring with a module preserves bijectivity? Wait, no. Wait, tensoring can kill torsion. For example, if \( A \) is a free abelian group of rank 1, and \( f: A \to A \) is multiplication by 3, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is the zero map, even though \( f \) is injective. But in our case, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, so tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. Because if a map between free abelian groups is an isomorphism, then tensoring with any module would give an isomorphism. Wait, but \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) might have torsion. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion coprime to 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) might kill that torsion. But if the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then it has to preserve the torsion subgroups. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) splits as free part plus torsion, and the map is an isomorphism on each part, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would map the torsion parts accordingly. Wait, but tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would annihilate any torsion coprime to 3, but preserve 3-torsion. However, the induced map on \( H_1(-; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is not just the tensor product of the integral homology map with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? Wait, actually, by the universal coefficient theorem, we have a split exact sequence:

\( 0 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \to \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \to 0 \).

But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so the Tor term vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Therefore, the induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would give an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then when we tensor it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), is the resulting map necessarily an isomorphism?

Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is, say, \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the induced map is still an isomorphism. If \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion, say \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would kill the \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) part, so \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Then, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the same as the induced map on the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is an isomorphism. Wait, but the torsion part is annihilated, so does the original map have to act as an isomorphism on the free part? Well, since \( f \) induces an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it has to preserve the free and torsion parts. So, if the free part is \( \mathbb{Z}^n \), and the torsion part is some finite abelian group, then \( f \) acts as an isomorphism on each. Then, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3^n \), and the torsion part with orders coprime to 3 are killed. But the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would only see the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the 3-torsion parts. However, since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the map remains an isomorphism on the components that survive. Therefore, even if there is torsion in \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), as long as the original map is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me test with a specific example where \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has 3-torsion. Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Then, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Wait, \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), because \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Now, if we have an automorphism \( f \) on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it would act as an automorphism on the free part \( \mathbb{Z} \) and on the torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Therefore, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z} \) becomes an automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). The torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \) tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is still \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), and the automorphism there is preserved. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the direct sum of these two automorphisms, hence an automorphism.

Therefore, even in the presence of torsion, as long as the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

But wait, is the assumption that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism sufficient to guarantee that \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism? Yes, because \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), and any isomorphism at the level of \( \pi_1 \) will descend to an isomorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is necessarily an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1(X) \) is abelian or not. Therefore, even if \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, as long as \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on homology with any coefficients (including \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) should be an isomorphism.

However, the problem states that \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian. Does that affect the argument? I don&#x27;t think so. The key point is that the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, which implies the induced map on \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1 \) was abelian or not. The non-abelianness of \( \pi_1(X) \) might just be a hint that the abelianization is non-trivial, but even if \( \pi_1(X) \) were abelian, the same conclusion would hold.

Therefore, unless there&#x27;s some subtlety I&#x27;m missing here, the answer should be yes, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me check one more angle. Suppose \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, so the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is an isomorphism. But by universal coefficients, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so Tor vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). So, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is isomorphic to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Suppose the fundamental group is non-abelian, so its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is a quotient. If the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, then it must preserve the commutator subgroup, so the induced map on the quotient \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism. Then, as above, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the non-abelianness, the conclusion holds.

Therefore, the answer should be yes. But let me check if there is a possible mistake in assuming that tensoring an isomorphism with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. If the original map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then each component (free and torsion) is an isomorphism. Tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would then either kill torsion components not divisible by 3 or preserve them if they are. However, since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, it must map torsion subgroups to themselves isomorphically. Therefore, if there is 3-torsion, it&#x27;s preserved; if there is torsion not divisible by 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) annihilates them, but since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1 \), the induced map on the remaining part (the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) and the 3-torsion) would still be an isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the coefficients, as long as the original map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}_3) \) is as well.

Therefore, I think the answer is yes, we can deduce that \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

Given a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, we need to determine if the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3): H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \to H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

1. **Fundamental Group and Homology**: The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \). Since \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, it induces an isomorphism on the abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \).

2. **Coefficient Change**: The first homology group with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \), can be obtained using the universal coefficient theorem. This theorem states that \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). Since \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, the Tor term vanishes, simplifying to \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

3. **Induced Map on Homology**: The induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is equivalent to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. This is because tensoring an isomorphism with any module (here, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) results in an isomorphism.

Thus, the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s tackle this problem step by step. The question is: if we have a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \), and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, can we conclude that the induced map on the first homology group with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) coefficients, \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \), is also an isomorphism?

First, let me recall some basic concepts. The fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) is the group of loops based at a point in \( X \), up to homotopy. The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), which means we take \( \pi_1(X) \) and make it abelian by quotienting out the commutator subgroup. For coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is the first homology group with coefficients in the abelian group \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). I think this is equivalent to taking the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \) and then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Given that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, we should consider what happens when we pass to the abelianization. Since the abelianization is a functor, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) should also be an isomorphism. Then, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is a right-exact functor, should preserve the isomorphism because tensoring an isomorphism with any module is still an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism as well.

Wait, but hold on. The fundamental group is non-abelian. Does that affect anything? Let me think. The key point is that even though \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is just the largest abelian quotient. If \( \pi_1(f) \) is an automorphism, then it should induce an automorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is also an isomorphism. Then, since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a field (well, a ring, but a simple one), tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) over \( \mathbb{Z} \) would preserve the isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But is there any possible catch here? Let me check with an example. Take a space with a non-abelian fundamental group, say a wedge of two circles. Wait, no, the fundamental group of a wedge of two circles is the free group on two generators, which is non-abelian. If we have a map inducing an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), then the induced map on \( H_1 \) with any coefficients should also be an isomorphism. For example, if the map swaps the two circles, that would induce an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), and correspondingly on \( H_1 \), even with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Alternatively, consider a more complicated space, like a surface. Take a closed orientable surface of genus \( g \geq 2 \). Its fundamental group is non-abelian, and any homeomorphism would induce an automorphism on \( \pi_1 \), hence on \( H_1 \), and tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. So in these examples, it seems to hold.

But maybe there&#x27;s a case where the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, but the map on \( H_1 \) with coefficients isn&#x27;t? Let me think. Suppose we have a group \( G \) and an automorphism \( \phi: G \to G \). Then, the induced map on the abelianization \( G^{ab} \) is \( \phi^{ab}: G^{ab} \to G^{ab} \). If \( \phi \) is an automorphism, then \( \phi^{ab} \) must also be an automorphism. Because the kernel of the abelianization is the commutator subgroup, which is characteristic, hence preserved under automorphisms. Therefore, the induced map on \( G^{ab} \) is indeed an automorphism.

Then, since \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) = H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a flat \( \mathbb{Z} \)-module (because it&#x27;s torsion-free? Wait, no, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is torsion. Wait, flatness over \( \mathbb{Z} \) requires that the module is torsion-free, which \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not. So tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not exact. But we have that if \( f: A \to B \) is an isomorphism of abelian groups, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to B \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is also an isomorphism. Because if \( f \) is an isomorphism, then it&#x27;s a bijective homomorphism, and tensoring with a module preserves bijectivity? Wait, no. Wait, tensoring can kill torsion. For example, if \( A \) is a free abelian group of rank 1, and \( f: A \to A \) is multiplication by 3, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is the zero map, even though \( f \) is injective. But in our case, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, so tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. Because if a map between free abelian groups is an isomorphism, then tensoring with any module would give an isomorphism. Wait, but \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) might have torsion. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion coprime to 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) might kill that torsion. But if the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then it has to preserve the torsion subgroups. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) splits as free part plus torsion, and the map is an isomorphism on each part, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would map the torsion parts accordingly. Wait, but tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would annihilate any torsion coprime to 3, but preserve 3-torsion. However, the induced map on \( H_1(-; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is not just the tensor product of the integral homology map with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? Wait, actually, by the universal coefficient theorem, we have a split exact sequence:

\( 0 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \to \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \to 0 \).

But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so the Tor term vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Therefore, the induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would give an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then when we tensor it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), is the resulting map necessarily an isomorphism?

Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is, say, \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the induced map is still an isomorphism. If \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion, say \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would kill the \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) part, so \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Then, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the same as the induced map on the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is an isomorphism. Wait, but the torsion part is annihilated, so does the original map have to act as an isomorphism on the free part? Well, since \( f \) induces an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it has to preserve the free and torsion parts. So, if the free part is \( \mathbb{Z}^n \), and the torsion part is some finite abelian group, then \( f \) acts as an isomorphism on each. Then, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3^n \), and the torsion part with orders coprime to 3 are killed. But the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would only see the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the 3-torsion parts. However, since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the map remains an isomorphism on the components that survive. Therefore, even if there is torsion in \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), as long as the original map is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me test with a specific example where \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has 3-torsion. Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Then, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Wait, \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), because \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Now, if we have an automorphism \( f \) on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it would act as an automorphism on the free part \( \mathbb{Z} \) and on the torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Therefore, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z} \) becomes an automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). The torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \) tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is still \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), and the automorphism there is preserved. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the direct sum of these two automorphisms, hence an automorphism.

Therefore, even in the presence of torsion, as long as the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

But wait, is the assumption that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism sufficient to guarantee that \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism? Yes, because \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), and any isomorphism at the level of \( \pi_1 \) will descend to an isomorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is necessarily an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1(X) \) is abelian or not. Therefore, even if \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, as long as \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on homology with any coefficients (including \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) should be an isomorphism.

However, the problem states that \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian. Does that affect the argument? I don&#x27;t think so. The key point is that the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, which implies the induced map on \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1 \) was abelian or not. The non-abelianness of \( \pi_1(X) \) might just be a hint that the abelianization is non-trivial, but even if \( \pi_1(X) \) were abelian, the same conclusion would hold.

Therefore, unless there&#x27;s some subtlety I&#x27;m missing here, the answer should be yes, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me check one more angle. Suppose \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, so the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is an isomorphism. But by universal coefficients, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so Tor vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). So, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is isomorphic to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Suppose the fundamental group is non-abelian, so its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is a quotient. If the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, then it must preserve the commutator subgroup, so the induced map on the quotient \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism. Then, as above, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the non-abelianness, the conclusion holds.

Therefore, the answer should be yes. But let me check if there is a possible mistake in assuming that tensoring an isomorphism with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. If the original map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then each component (free and torsion) is an isomorphism. Tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would then either kill torsion components not divisible by 3 or preserve them if they are. However, since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, it must map torsion subgroups to themselves isomorphically. Therefore, if there is 3-torsion, it&#x27;s preserved; if there is torsion not divisible by 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) annihilates them, but since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1 \), the induced map on the remaining part (the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) and the 3-torsion) would still be an isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the coefficients, as long as the original map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}_3) \) is as well.

Therefore, I think the answer is yes, we can deduce that \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

Because if \( f \) is an isomorphism, then it&#x27;s a bijective homomorphism, and tensoring with a module preserves bijectivity? Wait, no. Wait, tensoring can kill torsion. For example, if \( A \) is a free abelian group of rank 1, and \( f: A \to A \) is multiplication by 3, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is the zero map, even though \( f \) is injective. But in our case, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, so tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. Because if a map between free abelian groups is an isomorphism, then tensoring with any module would give an isomorphism. Wait, but \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) might have torsion. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion coprime to 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) might kill that torsion. But if the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then it has to preserve the torsion subgroups. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) splits as free part plus torsion, and the map is an isomorphism on each part, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would map the torsion parts accordingly. Wait, but tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would annihilate any torsion coprime to 3, but preserve 3-torsion. However, the induced map on \( H_1(-; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is not just the tensor product of the integral homology map with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? Wait, actually, by the universal coefficient theorem, we have a split exact sequence:

\( 0 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \to \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \to 0 \).

But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so the Tor term vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Therefore, the induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would give an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then when we tensor it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), is the resulting map necessarily an isomorphism?

Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is, say, \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the induced map is still an isomorphism. If \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion, say \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would kill the \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) part, so \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Then, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the same as the induced map on the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is an isomorphism. Wait, but the torsion part is annihilated, so does the original map have to act as an isomorphism on the free part? Well, since \( f \) induces an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it has to preserve the free and torsion parts. So, if the free part is \( \mathbb{Z}^n \), and the torsion part is some finite abelian group, then \( f \) acts as an isomorphism on each. Then, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3^n \), and the torsion part with orders coprime to 3 are killed. But the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would only see the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the 3-torsion parts. However, since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the map remains an isomorphism on the components that survive. Therefore, even if there is torsion in \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), as long as the original map is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me test with a specific example where \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has 3-torsion. Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Then, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Wait, \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), because \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Now, if we have an automorphism \( f \) on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it would act as an automorphism on the free part \( \mathbb{Z} \) and on the torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Therefore, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z} \) becomes an automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). The torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \) tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is still \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), and the automorphism there is preserved. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the direct sum of these two automorphisms, hence an automorphism.

Therefore, even in the presence of torsion, as long as the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

But wait, is the assumption that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism sufficient to guarantee that \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism? Yes, because \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), and any isomorphism at the level of \( \pi_1 \) will descend to an isomorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is necessarily an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1(X) \) is abelian or not. Therefore, even if \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, as long as \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on homology with any coefficients (including \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) should be an isomorphism.

However, the problem states that \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian. Does that affect the argument? I don&#x27;t think so. The key point is that the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, which implies the induced map on \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1 \) was abelian or not. The non-abelianness of \( \pi_1(X) \) might just be a hint that the abelianization is non-trivial, but even if \( \pi_1(X) \) were abelian, the same conclusion would hold.

Therefore, unless there&#x27;s some subtlety I&#x27;m missing here, the answer should be yes, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me check one more angle. Suppose \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, so the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is an isomorphism. But by universal coefficients, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so Tor vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). So, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is isomorphic to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Suppose the fundamental group is non-abelian, so its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is a quotient. If the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, then it must preserve the commutator subgroup, so the induced map on the quotient \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism. Then, as above, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the non-abelianness, the conclusion holds.

Therefore, the answer should be yes. But let me check if there is a possible mistake in assuming that tensoring an isomorphism with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. If the original map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then each component (free and torsion) is an isomorphism. Tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would then either kill torsion components not divisible by 3 or preserve them if they are. However, since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, it must map torsion subgroups to themselves isomorphically. Therefore, if there is 3-torsion, it&#x27;s preserved; if there is torsion not divisible by 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) annihilates them, but since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1 \), the induced map on the remaining part (the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) and the 3-torsion) would still be an isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the coefficients, as long as the original map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}_3) \) is as well.

Therefore, I think the answer is yes, we can deduce that \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, we need to determine if the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3): H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \to H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

1. **Fundamental Group and Homology**: The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \). Since \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, it induces an isomorphism on the abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \).

2. **Coefficient Change**: The first homology group with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \), can be obtained using the universal coefficient theorem. This theorem states that \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). Since \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, the Tor term vanishes, simplifying to \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

3. **Induced Map on Homology**: The induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is equivalent to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. This is because tensoring an isomorphism with any module (here, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) results in an isomorphism.

Thus, the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s tackle this problem step by step. The question is: if we have a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \), and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, can we conclude that the induced map on the first homology group with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) coefficients, \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \), is also an isomorphism?

First, let me recall some basic concepts. The fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) is the group of loops based at a point in \( X \), up to homotopy. The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), which means we take \( \pi_1(X) \) and make it abelian by quotienting out the commutator subgroup. For coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is the first homology group with coefficients in the abelian group \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). I think this is equivalent to taking the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \) and then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Given that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, we should consider what happens when we pass to the abelianization. Since the abelianization is a functor, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) should also be an isomorphism. Then, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is a right-exact functor, should preserve the isomorphism because tensoring an isomorphism with any module is still an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism as well.

Wait, but hold on. The fundamental group is non-abelian. Does that affect anything? Let me think. The key point is that even though \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is just the largest abelian quotient. If \( \pi_1(f) \) is an automorphism, then it should induce an automorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is also an isomorphism. Then, since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a field (well, a ring, but a simple one), tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) over \( \mathbb{Z} \) would preserve the isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But is there any possible catch here? Let me check with an example. Take a space with a non-abelian fundamental group, say a wedge of two circles. Wait, no, the fundamental group of a wedge of two circles is the free group on two generators, which is non-abelian. If we have a map inducing an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), then the induced map on \( H_1 \) with any coefficients should also be an isomorphism. For example, if the map swaps the two circles, that would induce an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), and correspondingly on \( H_1 \), even with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Alternatively, consider a more complicated space, like a surface. Take a closed orientable surface of genus \( g \geq 2 \). Its fundamental group is non-abelian, and any homeomorphism would induce an automorphism on \( \pi_1 \), hence on \( H_1 \), and tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. So in these examples, it seems to hold.

But maybe there&#x27;s a case where the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, but the map on \( H_1 \) with coefficients isn&#x27;t? Let me think. Suppose we have a group \( G \) and an automorphism \( \phi: G \to G \). Then, the induced map on the abelianization \( G^{ab} \) is \( \phi^{ab}: G^{ab} \to G^{ab} \). If \( \phi \) is an automorphism, then \( \phi^{ab} \) must also be an automorphism. Because the kernel of the abelianization is the commutator subgroup, which is characteristic, hence preserved under automorphisms. Therefore, the induced map on \( G^{ab} \) is indeed an automorphism.

Then, since \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) = H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a flat \( \mathbb{Z} \)-module (because it&#x27;s torsion-free? Wait, no, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is torsion. Wait, flatness over \( \mathbb{Z} \) requires that the module is torsion-free, which \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not. So tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not exact. But we have that if \( f: A \to B \) is an isomorphism of abelian groups, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to B \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is also an isomorphism. Because if \( f \) is an isomorphism, then it&#x27;s a bijective homomorphism, and tensoring with a module preserves bijectivity? Wait, no. Wait, tensoring can kill torsion. For example, if \( A \) is a free abelian group of rank 1, and \( f: A \to A \) is multiplication by 3, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is the zero map, even though \( f \) is injective. But in our case, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, so tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. Because if a map between free abelian groups is an isomorphism, then tensoring with any module would give an isomorphism. Wait, but \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) might have torsion. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion coprime to 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) might kill that torsion. But if the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then it has to preserve the torsion subgroups. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) splits as free part plus torsion, and the map is an isomorphism on each part, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would map the torsion parts accordingly. Wait, but tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would annihilate any torsion coprime to 3, but preserve 3-torsion. However, the induced map on \( H_1(-; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is not just the tensor product of the integral homology map with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? Wait, actually, by the universal coefficient theorem, we have a split exact sequence:

\( 0 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \to \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \to 0 \).

But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so the Tor term vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Therefore, the induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would give an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then when we tensor it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), is the resulting map necessarily an isomorphism?

Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is, say, \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the induced map is still an isomorphism. If \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion, say \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would kill the \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) part, so \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Then, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the same as the induced map on the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is an isomorphism. Wait, but the torsion part is annihilated, so does the original map have to act as an isomorphism on the free part? Well, since \( f \) induces an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it has to preserve the free and torsion parts. So, if the free part is \( \mathbb{Z}^n \), and the torsion part is some finite abelian group, then \( f \) acts as an isomorphism on each. Then, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3^n \), and the torsion part with orders coprime to 3 are killed. But the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would only see the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the 3-torsion parts. However, since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the map remains an isomorphism on the components that survive. Therefore, even if there is torsion in \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), as long as the original map is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me test with a specific example where \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has 3-torsion. Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Then, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Wait, \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), because \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Now, if we have an automorphism \( f \) on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it would act as an automorphism on the free part \( \mathbb{Z} \) and on the torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Therefore, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z} \) becomes an automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). The torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \) tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is still \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), and the automorphism there is preserved. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the direct sum of these two automorphisms, hence an automorphism.

Therefore, even in the presence of torsion, as long as the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

But wait, is the assumption that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism sufficient to guarantee that \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism? Yes, because \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), and any isomorphism at the level of \( \pi_1 \) will descend to an isomorphism on the abelianization.

But by universal coefficients, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so Tor vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). So, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is isomorphic to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Suppose the fundamental group is non-abelian, so its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is a quotient. If the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, then it must preserve the commutator subgroup, so the induced map on the quotient \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism. Then, as above, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the non-abelianness, the conclusion holds.

Therefore, the answer should be yes. But let me check if there is a possible mistake in assuming that tensoring an isomorphism with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. If the original map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then each component (free and torsion) is an isomorphism. Tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would then either kill torsion components not divisible by 3 or preserve them if they are. However, since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, it must map torsion subgroups to themselves isomorphically. Therefore, if there is 3-torsion, it&#x27;s preserved; if there is torsion not divisible by 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) annihilates them, but since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1 \), the induced map on the remaining part (the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) and the 3-torsion) would still be an isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the coefficients, as long as the original map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}_3) \) is as well.

Therefore, I think the answer is yes, we can deduce that \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

Given a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, we need to determine if the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3): H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \to H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

1. **Fundamental Group and Homology**: The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \). Since \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, it induces an isomorphism on the abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \).

2. **Coefficient Change**: The first homology group with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \), can be obtained using the universal coefficient theorem. This theorem states that \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). Since \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, the Tor term vanishes, simplifying to \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

3. **Induced Map on Homology**: The induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is equivalent to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. This is because tensoring an isomorphism with any module (here, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) results in an isomorphism.

Thus, the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s tackle this problem step by step. The question is: if we have a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \), and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, can we conclude that the induced map on the first homology group with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) coefficients, \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \), is also an isomorphism?

First, let me recall some basic concepts. The fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) is the group of loops based at a point in \( X \), up to homotopy. The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), which means we take \( \pi_1(X) \) and make it abelian by quotienting out the commutator subgroup. For coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is the first homology group with coefficients in the abelian group \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). I think this is equivalent to taking the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \) and then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Given that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, we should consider what happens when we pass to the abelianization. Since the abelianization is a functor, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) should also be an isomorphism. Then, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is a right-exact functor, should preserve the isomorphism because tensoring an isomorphism with any module is still an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism as well.

Wait, but hold on. The fundamental group is non-abelian. Does that affect anything? Let me think. The key point is that even though \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is just the largest abelian quotient. If \( \pi_1(f) \) is an automorphism, then it should induce an automorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is also an isomorphism. Then, since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a field (well, a ring, but a simple one), tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) over \( \mathbb{Z} \) would preserve the isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But is there any possible catch here? Let me check with an example. Take a space with a non-abelian fundamental group, say a wedge of two circles. Wait, no, the fundamental group of a wedge of two circles is the free group on two generators, which is non-abelian. If we have a map inducing an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), then the induced map on \( H_1 \) with any coefficients should also be an isomorphism. For example, if the map swaps the two circles, that would induce an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), and correspondingly on \( H_1 \), even with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Alternatively, consider a more complicated space, like a surface. Take a closed orientable surface of genus \( g \geq 2 \). Its fundamental group is non-abelian, and any homeomorphism would induce an automorphism on \( \pi_1 \), hence on \( H_1 \), and tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. So in these examples, it seems to hold.

But maybe there&#x27;s a case where the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, but the map on \( H_1 \) with coefficients isn&#x27;t? Let me think. Suppose we have a group \( G \) and an automorphism \( \phi: G \to G \). Then, the induced map on the abelianization \( G^{ab} \) is \( \phi^{ab}: G^{ab} \to G^{ab} \). If \( \phi \) is an automorphism, then \( \phi^{ab} \) must also be an automorphism. Because the kernel of the abelianization is the commutator subgroup, which is characteristic, hence preserved under automorphisms. Therefore, the induced map on \( G^{ab} \) is indeed an automorphism.

Then, since \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) = H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a flat \( \mathbb{Z} \)-module (because it&#x27;s torsion-free? Wait, no, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is torsion. Wait, flatness over \( \mathbb{Z} \) requires that the module is torsion-free, which \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not. So tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not exact. But we have that if \( f: A \to B \) is an isomorphism of abelian groups, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to B \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is also an isomorphism. Because if \( f \) is an isomorphism, then it&#x27;s a bijective homomorphism, and tensoring with a module preserves bijectivity? Wait, no. Wait, tensoring can kill torsion. For example, if \( A \) is a free abelian group of rank 1, and \( f: A \to A \) is multiplication by 3, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is the zero map, even though \( f \) is injective. But in our case, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, so tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. Because if a map between free abelian groups is an isomorphism, then tensoring with any module would give an isomorphism. Wait, but \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) might have torsion. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion coprime to 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) might kill that torsion. But if the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then it has to preserve the torsion subgroups. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) splits as free part plus torsion, and the map is an isomorphism on each part, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would map the torsion parts accordingly. Wait, but tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would annihilate any torsion coprime to 3, but preserve 3-torsion. However, the induced map on \( H_1(-; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is not just the tensor product of the integral homology map with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? Wait, actually, by the universal coefficient theorem, we have a split exact sequence:

\( 0 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \to \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \to 0 \).

But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so the Tor term vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Therefore, the induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would give an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then when we tensor it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), is the resulting map necessarily an isomorphism?

Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is, say, \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the induced map is still an isomorphism. If \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion, say \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would kill the \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) part, so \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Then, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the same as the induced map on the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is an isomorphism. Wait, but the torsion part is annihilated, so does the original map have to act as an isomorphism on the free part? Well, since \( f \) induces an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it has to preserve the free and torsion parts. So, if the free part is \( \mathbb{Z}^n \), and the torsion part is some finite abelian group, then \( f \) acts as an isomorphism on each. Then, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3^n \), and the torsion part with orders coprime to 3 are killed. But the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would only see the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the 3-torsion parts. However, since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the map remains an isomorphism on the components that survive. Therefore, even if there is torsion in \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), as long as the original map is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me test with a specific example where \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has 3-torsion. Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Then, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Wait, \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), because \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Now, if we have an automorphism \( f \) on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it would act as an automorphism on the free part \( \mathbb{Z} \) and on the torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Therefore, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z} \) becomes an automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). The torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \) tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is still \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), and the automorphism there is preserved. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the direct sum of these two automorphisms, hence an automorphism.

Therefore, even in the presence of torsion, as long as the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

But wait, is the assumption that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism sufficient to guarantee that \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism? Yes, because \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), and any isomorphism at the level of \( \pi_1 \) will descend to an isomorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is necessarily an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1(X) \) is abelian or not. Therefore, even if \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, as long as \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on homology with any coefficients (including \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) should be an isomorphism.

However, the problem states that \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian. Does that affect the argument? I don&#x27;t think so. The key point is that the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, which implies the induced map on \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1 \) was abelian or not. The non-abelianness of \( \pi_1(X) \) might just be a hint that the abelianization is non-trivial, but even if \( \pi_1(X) \) were abelian, the same conclusion would hold.

Therefore, unless there&#x27;s some subtlety I&#x27;m missing here, the answer should be yes, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me check one more angle. Suppose \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, so the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is an isomorphism. But by universal coefficients, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so Tor vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). So, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is isomorphic to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Suppose the fundamental group is non-abelian, so its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is a quotient. If the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, then it must preserve the commutator subgroup, so the induced map on the quotient \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism. Then, as above, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the non-abelianness, the conclusion holds.

Therefore, the answer should be yes. But let me check if there is a possible mistake in assuming that tensoring an isomorphism with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. If the original map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then each component (free and torsion) is an isomorphism. Tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would then either kill torsion components not divisible by 3 or preserve them if they are. However, since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, it must map torsion subgroups to themselves isomorphically. Therefore, if there is 3-torsion, it&#x27;s preserved; if there is torsion not divisible by 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) annihilates them, but since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1 \), the induced map on the remaining part (the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) and the 3-torsion) would still be an isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the coefficients, as long as the original map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}_3) \) is as well.

Wait, no, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is torsion. Wait, flatness over \( \mathbb{Z} \) requires that the module is torsion-free, which \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not. So tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not exact. But we have that if \( f: A \to B \) is an isomorphism of abelian groups, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to B \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is also an isomorphism. Because if \( f \) is an isomorphism, then it&#x27;s a bijective homomorphism, and tensoring with a module preserves bijectivity? Wait, no. Wait, tensoring can kill torsion. For example, if \( A \) is a free abelian group of rank 1, and \( f: A \to A \) is multiplication by 3, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is the zero map, even though \( f \) is injective. But in our case, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, so tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. Because if a map between free abelian groups is an isomorphism, then tensoring with any module would give an isomorphism. Wait, but \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) might have torsion. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion coprime to 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) might kill that torsion. But if the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then it has to preserve the torsion subgroups. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) splits as free part plus torsion, and the map is an isomorphism on each part, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would map the torsion parts accordingly. Wait, but tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would annihilate any torsion coprime to 3, but preserve 3-torsion. However, the induced map on \( H_1(-; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is not just the tensor product of the integral homology map with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? Wait, actually, by the universal coefficient theorem, we have a split exact sequence:

\( 0 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \to \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \to 0 \).

But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so the Tor term vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Therefore, the induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would give an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then when we tensor it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), is the resulting map necessarily an isomorphism?

Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is, say, \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the induced map is still an isomorphism. If \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion, say \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would kill the \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) part, so \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Then, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the same as the induced map on the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is an isomorphism. Wait, but the torsion part is annihilated, so does the original map have to act as an isomorphism on the free part? Well, since \( f \) induces an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it has to preserve the free and torsion parts. So, if the free part is \( \mathbb{Z}^n \), and the torsion part is some finite abelian group, then \( f \) acts as an isomorphism on each. Then, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3^n \), and the torsion part with orders coprime to 3 are killed. But the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would only see the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the 3-torsion parts. However, since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the map remains an isomorphism on the components that survive. Therefore, even if there is torsion in \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), as long as the original map is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me test with a specific example where \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has 3-torsion. Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Then, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Wait, \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), because \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Now, if we have an automorphism \( f \) on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it would act as an automorphism on the free part \( \mathbb{Z} \) and on the torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Therefore, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z} \) becomes an automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). The torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \) tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is still \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), and the automorphism there is preserved. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the direct sum of these two automorphisms, hence an automorphism.

Therefore, even in the presence of torsion, as long as the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

But wait, is the assumption that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism sufficient to guarantee that \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism? Yes, because \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), and any isomorphism at the level of \( \pi_1 \) will descend to an isomorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is necessarily an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1(X) \) is abelian or not. Therefore, even if \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, as long as \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on homology with any coefficients (including \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) should be an isomorphism.

However, the problem states that \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian. Does that affect the argument? I don&#x27;t think so. The key point is that the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, which implies the induced map on \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1 \) was abelian or not. The non-abelianness of \( \pi_1(X) \) might just be a hint that the abelianization is non-trivial, but even if \( \pi_1(X) \) were abelian, the same conclusion would hold.

Therefore, unless there&#x27;s some subtlety I&#x27;m missing here, the answer should be yes, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me check one more angle. Suppose \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, so the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is an isomorphism. But by universal coefficients, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so Tor vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). So, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is isomorphic to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Suppose the fundamental group is non-abelian, so its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is a quotient. If the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, then it must preserve the commutator subgroup, so the induced map on the quotient \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism. Then, as above, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the non-abelianness, the conclusion holds.

Therefore, the answer should be yes. But let me check if there is a possible mistake in assuming that tensoring an isomorphism with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. If the original map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then each component (free and torsion) is an isomorphism. Tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would then either kill torsion components not divisible by 3 or preserve them if they are. However, since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, it must map torsion subgroups to themselves isomorphically. Therefore, if there is 3-torsion, it&#x27;s preserved; if there is torsion not divisible by 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) annihilates them, but since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1 \), the induced map on the remaining part (the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) and the 3-torsion) would still be an isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the coefficients, as long as the original map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}_3) \) is as well.

Therefore, I think the answer is yes, we can deduce that \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, we need to determine if the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3): H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \to H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

1. **Fundamental Group and Homology**: The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \). Since \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, it induces an isomorphism on the abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \).

2. **Coefficient Change**: The first homology group with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \), can be obtained using the universal coefficient theorem. This theorem states that \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). Since \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, the Tor term vanishes, simplifying to \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

3. **Induced Map on Homology**: The induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is equivalent to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. This is because tensoring an isomorphism with any module (here, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) results in an isomorphism.

Thus, the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s tackle this problem step by step. The question is: if we have a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \), and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, can we conclude that the induced map on the first homology group with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) coefficients, \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \), is also an isomorphism?

First, let me recall some basic concepts. The fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) is the group of loops based at a point in \( X \), up to homotopy. The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), which means we take \( \pi_1(X) \) and make it abelian by quotienting out the commutator subgroup. For coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is the first homology group with coefficients in the abelian group \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). I think this is equivalent to taking the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \) and then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Given that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, we should consider what happens when we pass to the abelianization. Since the abelianization is a functor, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) should also be an isomorphism. Then, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is a right-exact functor, should preserve the isomorphism because tensoring an isomorphism with any module is still an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism as well.

Wait, but hold on. The fundamental group is non-abelian. Does that affect anything? Let me think. The key point is that even though \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is just the largest abelian quotient. If \( \pi_1(f) \) is an automorphism, then it should induce an automorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is also an isomorphism. Then, since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a field (well, a ring, but a simple one), tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) over \( \mathbb{Z} \) would preserve the isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But is there any possible catch here? Let me check with an example. Take a space with a non-abelian fundamental group, say a wedge of two circles. Wait, no, the fundamental group of a wedge of two circles is the free group on two generators, which is non-abelian. If we have a map inducing an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), then the induced map on \( H_1 \) with any coefficients should also be an isomorphism. For example, if the map swaps the two circles, that would induce an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), and correspondingly on \( H_1 \), even with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Alternatively, consider a more complicated space, like a surface. Take a closed orientable surface of genus \( g \geq 2 \). Its fundamental group is non-abelian, and any homeomorphism would induce an automorphism on \( \pi_1 \), hence on \( H_1 \), and tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. So in these examples, it seems to hold.

But maybe there&#x27;s a case where the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, but the map on \( H_1 \) with coefficients isn&#x27;t? Let me think. Suppose we have a group \( G \) and an automorphism \( \phi: G \to G \). Then, the induced map on the abelianization \( G^{ab} \) is \( \phi^{ab}: G^{ab} \to G^{ab} \). If \( \phi \) is an automorphism, then \( \phi^{ab} \) must also be an automorphism. Because the kernel of the abelianization is the commutator subgroup, which is characteristic, hence preserved under automorphisms. Therefore, the induced map on \( G^{ab} \) is indeed an automorphism.

Then, since \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) = H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a flat \( \mathbb{Z} \)-module (because it&#x27;s torsion-free? Wait, no, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is torsion. Wait, flatness over \( \mathbb{Z} \) requires that the module is torsion-free, which \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not. So tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not exact. But we have that if \( f: A \to B \) is an isomorphism of abelian groups, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to B \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is also an isomorphism. Because if \( f \) is an isomorphism, then it&#x27;s a bijective homomorphism, and tensoring with a module preserves bijectivity? Wait, no. Wait, tensoring can kill torsion. For example, if \( A \) is a free abelian group of rank 1, and \( f: A \to A \) is multiplication by 3, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is the zero map, even though \( f \) is injective. But in our case, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, so tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. Because if a map between free abelian groups is an isomorphism, then tensoring with any module would give an isomorphism. Wait, but \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) might have torsion. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion coprime to 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) might kill that torsion. But if the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then it has to preserve the torsion subgroups. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) splits as free part plus torsion, and the map is an isomorphism on each part, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would map the torsion parts accordingly. Wait, but tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would annihilate any torsion coprime to 3, but preserve 3-torsion. However, the induced map on \( H_1(-; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is not just the tensor product of the integral homology map with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? Wait, actually, by the universal coefficient theorem, we have a split exact sequence:

\( 0 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \to \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \to 0 \).

But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so the Tor term vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Therefore, the induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would give an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then when we tensor it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), is the resulting map necessarily an isomorphism?

Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is, say, \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the induced map is still an isomorphism. If \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion, say \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would kill the \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) part, so \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Then, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the same as the induced map on the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is an isomorphism. Wait, but the torsion part is annihilated, so does the original map have to act as an isomorphism on the free part? Well, since \( f \) induces an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it has to preserve the free and torsion parts. So, if the free part is \( \mathbb{Z}^n \), and the torsion part is some finite abelian group, then \( f \) acts as an isomorphism on each. Then, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3^n \), and the torsion part with orders coprime to 3 are killed. But the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would only see the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the 3-torsion parts. However, since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the map remains an isomorphism on the components that survive. Therefore, even if there is torsion in \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), as long as the original map is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me test with a specific example where \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has 3-torsion. Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Then, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Wait, \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), because \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Now, if we have an automorphism \( f \) on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it would act as an automorphism on the free part \( \mathbb{Z} \) and on the torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Therefore, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z} \) becomes an automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). The torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \) tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is still \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), and the automorphism there is preserved. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the direct sum of these two automorphisms, hence an automorphism.

Therefore, even in the presence of torsion, as long as the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

But wait, is the assumption that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism sufficient to guarantee that \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism? Yes, because \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), and any isomorphism at the level of \( \pi_1 \) will descend to an isomorphism on the abelianization.

So, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is isomorphic to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Suppose the fundamental group is non-abelian, so its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is a quotient. If the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, then it must preserve the commutator subgroup, so the induced map on the quotient \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism. Then, as above, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the non-abelianness, the conclusion holds.

Therefore, the answer should be yes. But let me check if there is a possible mistake in assuming that tensoring an isomorphism with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. If the original map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then each component (free and torsion) is an isomorphism. Tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would then either kill torsion components not divisible by 3 or preserve them if they are. However, since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, it must map torsion subgroups to themselves isomorphically. Therefore, if there is 3-torsion, it&#x27;s preserved; if there is torsion not divisible by 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) annihilates them, but since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1 \), the induced map on the remaining part (the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) and the 3-torsion) would still be an isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the coefficients, as long as the original map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}_3) \) is as well.

Therefore, I think the answer is yes, we can deduce that \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}

Given a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, we need to determine if the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3): H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \to H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

1. **Fundamental Group and Homology**: The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \). Since \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, it induces an isomorphism on the abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \).

2. **Coefficient Change**: The first homology group with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \), can be obtained using the universal coefficient theorem. This theorem states that \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). Since \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, the Tor term vanishes, simplifying to \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

3. **Induced Map on Homology**: The induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is equivalent to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. This is because tensoring an isomorphism with any module (here, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) results in an isomorphism.

Thus, the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s tackle this problem step by step. The question is: if we have a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \), and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, can we conclude that the induced map on the first homology group with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) coefficients, \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \), is also an isomorphism?

First, let me recall some basic concepts. The fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) is the group of loops based at a point in \( X \), up to homotopy. The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), which means we take \( \pi_1(X) \) and make it abelian by quotienting out the commutator subgroup. For coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is the first homology group with coefficients in the abelian group \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). I think this is equivalent to taking the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \) and then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Given that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, we should consider what happens when we pass to the abelianization. Since the abelianization is a functor, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) should also be an isomorphism. Then, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is a right-exact functor, should preserve the isomorphism because tensoring an isomorphism with any module is still an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism as well.

Wait, but hold on. The fundamental group is non-abelian. Does that affect anything? Let me think. The key point is that even though \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is just the largest abelian quotient. If \( \pi_1(f) \) is an automorphism, then it should induce an automorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is also an isomorphism. Then, since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a field (well, a ring, but a simple one), tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) over \( \mathbb{Z} \) would preserve the isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But is there any possible catch here? Let me check with an example. Take a space with a non-abelian fundamental group, say a wedge of two circles. Wait, no, the fundamental group of a wedge of two circles is the free group on two generators, which is non-abelian. If we have a map inducing an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), then the induced map on \( H_1 \) with any coefficients should also be an isomorphism. For example, if the map swaps the two circles, that would induce an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), and correspondingly on \( H_1 \), even with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Alternatively, consider a more complicated space, like a surface. Take a closed orientable surface of genus \( g \geq 2 \). Its fundamental group is non-abelian, and any homeomorphism would induce an automorphism on \( \pi_1 \), hence on \( H_1 \), and tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. So in these examples, it seems to hold.

But maybe there&#x27;s a case where the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, but the map on \( H_1 \) with coefficients isn&#x27;t? Let me think. Suppose we have a group \( G \) and an automorphism \( \phi: G \to G \). Then, the induced map on the abelianization \( G^{ab} \) is \( \phi^{ab}: G^{ab} \to G^{ab} \). If \( \phi \) is an automorphism, then \( \phi^{ab} \) must also be an automorphism. Because the kernel of the abelianization is the commutator subgroup, which is characteristic, hence preserved under automorphisms. Therefore, the induced map on \( G^{ab} \) is indeed an automorphism.

Then, since \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) = H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a flat \( \mathbb{Z} \)-module (because it&#x27;s torsion-free? Wait, no, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is torsion. Wait, flatness over \( \mathbb{Z} \) requires that the module is torsion-free, which \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not. So tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not exact. But we have that if \( f: A \to B \) is an isomorphism of abelian groups, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to B \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is also an isomorphism. Because if \( f \) is an isomorphism, then it&#x27;s a bijective homomorphism, and tensoring with a module preserves bijectivity? Wait, no. Wait, tensoring can kill torsion. For example, if \( A \) is a free abelian group of rank 1, and \( f: A \to A \) is multiplication by 3, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is the zero map, even though \( f \) is injective. But in our case, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, so tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. Because if a map between free abelian groups is an isomorphism, then tensoring with any module would give an isomorphism. Wait, but \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) might have torsion. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion coprime to 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) might kill that torsion. But if the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then it has to preserve the torsion subgroups. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) splits as free part plus torsion, and the map is an isomorphism on each part, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would map the torsion parts accordingly. Wait, but tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would annihilate any torsion coprime to 3, but preserve 3-torsion. However, the induced map on \( H_1(-; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is not just the tensor product of the integral homology map with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? Wait, actually, by the universal coefficient theorem, we have a split exact sequence:

\( 0 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \to \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \to 0 \).

But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so the Tor term vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Therefore, the induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would give an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then when we tensor it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), is the resulting map necessarily an isomorphism?

Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is, say, \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the induced map is still an isomorphism. If \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion, say \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would kill the \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) part, so \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Then, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the same as the induced map on the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is an isomorphism. Wait, but the torsion part is annihilated, so does the original map have to act as an isomorphism on the free part? Well, since \( f \) induces an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it has to preserve the free and torsion parts. So, if the free part is \( \mathbb{Z}^n \), and the torsion part is some finite abelian group, then \( f \) acts as an isomorphism on each. Then, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3^n \), and the torsion part with orders coprime to 3 are killed. But the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would only see the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the 3-torsion parts. However, since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the map remains an isomorphism on the components that survive. Therefore, even if there is torsion in \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), as long as the original map is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me test with a specific example where \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has 3-torsion. Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Then, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Wait, \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), because \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Now, if we have an automorphism \( f \) on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it would act as an automorphism on the free part \( \mathbb{Z} \) and on the torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Therefore, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z} \) becomes an automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). The torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \) tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is still \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), and the automorphism there is preserved. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the direct sum of these two automorphisms, hence an automorphism.

Therefore, even in the presence of torsion, as long as the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

But wait, is the assumption that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism sufficient to guarantee that \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism? Yes, because \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), and any isomorphism at the level of \( \pi_1 \) will descend to an isomorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is necessarily an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1(X) \) is abelian or not. Therefore, even if \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, as long as \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on homology with any coefficients (including \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) should be an isomorphism.

However, the problem states that \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian. Does that affect the argument? I don&#x27;t think so. The key point is that the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, which implies the induced map on \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1 \) was abelian or not. The non-abelianness of \( \pi_1(X) \) might just be a hint that the abelianization is non-trivial, but even if \( \pi_1(X) \) were abelian, the same conclusion would hold.

Therefore, unless there&#x27;s some subtlety I&#x27;m missing here, the answer should be yes, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me check one more angle. Suppose \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, so the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is an isomorphism. But by universal coefficients, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so Tor vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). So, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is isomorphic to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Suppose the fundamental group is non-abelian, so its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is a quotient. If the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, then it must preserve the commutator subgroup, so the induced map on the quotient \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism. Then, as above, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the non-abelianness, the conclusion holds.

Therefore, the answer should be yes. But let me check if there is a possible mistake in assuming that tensoring an isomorphism with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. If the original map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then each component (free and torsion) is an isomorphism. Tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would then either kill torsion components not divisible by 3 or preserve them if they are. However, since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, it must map torsion subgroups to themselves isomorphically.

Therefore, regardless of the coefficients, as long as the original map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}_3) \) is as well.

Suppose we have a group \( G \) and an automorphism \( \phi: G \to G \). Then, the induced map on the abelianization \( G^{ab} \) is \( \phi^{ab}: G^{ab} \to G^{ab} \). If \( \phi \) is an automorphism, then \( \phi^{ab} \) must also be an automorphism. Because the kernel of the abelianization is the commutator subgroup, which is characteristic, hence preserved under automorphisms. Therefore, the induced map on \( G^{ab} \) is indeed an automorphism.

Then, since \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) = H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a flat \( \mathbb{Z} \)-module (because it&#x27;s torsion-free? Wait, no, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is torsion. Wait, flatness over \( \mathbb{Z} \) requires that the module is torsion-free, which \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not. So tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not exact. But we have that if \( f: A \to B \) is an isomorphism of abelian groups, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to B \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is also an isomorphism. Because if \( f \) is an isomorphism, then it&#x27;s a bijective homomorphism, and tensoring with a module preserves bijectivity? Wait, no. Wait, tensoring can kill torsion. For example, if \( A \) is a free abelian group of rank 1, and \( f: A \to A \) is multiplication by 3, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is the zero map, even though \( f \) is injective. But in our case, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, so tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. Because if a map between free abelian groups is an isomorphism, then tensoring with any module would give an isomorphism. Wait, but \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) might have torsion. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion coprime to 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) might kill that torsion. But if the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then it has to preserve the torsion subgroups. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) splits as free part plus torsion, and the map is an isomorphism on each part, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would map the torsion parts accordingly. Wait, but tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would annihilate any torsion coprime to 3, but preserve 3-torsion. However, the induced map on \( H_1(-; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is not just the tensor product of the integral homology map with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? Wait, actually, by the universal coefficient theorem, we have a split exact sequence:

\( 0 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \to \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \to 0 \).

But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so the Tor term vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Therefore, the induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would give an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then when we tensor it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), is the resulting map necessarily an isomorphism?

Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is, say, \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the induced map is still an isomorphism. If \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion, say \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would kill the \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) part, so \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Then, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the same as the induced map on the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is an isomorphism. Wait, but the torsion part is annihilated, so does the original map have to act as an isomorphism on the free part? Well, since \( f \) induces an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it has to preserve the free and torsion parts. So, if the free part is \( \mathbb{Z}^n \), and the torsion part is some finite abelian group, then \( f \) acts as an isomorphism on each. Then, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3^n \), and the torsion part with orders coprime to 3 are killed. But the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would only see the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the 3-torsion parts. However, since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the map remains an isomorphism on the components that survive. Therefore, even if there is torsion in \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), as long as the original map is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me test with a specific example where \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has 3-torsion. Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Then, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Wait, \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), because \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Now, if we have an automorphism \( f \) on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it would act as an automorphism on the free part \( \mathbb{Z} \) and on the torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Therefore, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z} \) becomes an automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). The torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \) tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is still \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), and the automorphism there is preserved. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the direct sum of these two automorphisms, hence an automorphism.

Therefore, even in the presence of torsion, as long as the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

But wait, is the assumption that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism sufficient to guarantee that \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism? Yes, because \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), and any isomorphism at the level of \( \pi_1 \) will descend to an isomorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is necessarily an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1(X) \) is abelian or not. Therefore, even if \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, as long as \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on homology with any coefficients (including \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) should be an isomorphism.

However, the problem states that \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian. Does that affect the argument? I don&#x27;t think so. The key point is that the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, which implies the induced map on \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1 \) was abelian or not. The non-abelianness of \( \pi_1(X) \) might just be a hint that the abelianization is non-trivial, but even if \( \pi_1(X) \) were abelian, the same conclusion would hold.

Therefore, unless there&#x27;s some subtlety I&#x27;m missing here, the answer should be yes, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me check one more angle. Suppose \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, so the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is an isomorphism. But by universal coefficients, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so Tor vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). So, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is isomorphic to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Suppose the fundamental group is non-abelian, so its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is a quotient. If the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, then it must preserve the commutator subgroup, so the induced map on the quotient \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism. Then, as above, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the non-abelianness, the conclusion holds.

Therefore, the answer should be yes. But let me check if there is a possible mistake in assuming that tensoring an isomorphism with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. If the original map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then each component (free and torsion) is an isomorphism. Tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would then either kill torsion components not divisible by 3 or preserve them if they are. However, since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, it must map torsion subgroups to themselves isomorphically. Therefore, if there is 3-torsion, it&#x27;s preserved; if there is torsion not divisible by 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) annihilates them, but since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1 \), the induced map on the remaining part (the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) and the 3-torsion) would still be an isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the coefficients, as long as the original map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}_3) \) is as well.

Therefore, I think the answer is yes, we can deduce that \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, we need to determine if the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3): H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \to H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

1. **Fundamental Group and Homology**: The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \). Since \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, it induces an isomorphism on the abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \).

2. **Coefficient Change**: The first homology group with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \), can be obtained using the universal coefficient theorem. This theorem states that \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). Since \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, the Tor term vanishes, simplifying to \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

3. **Induced Map on Homology**: The induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is equivalent to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. This is because tensoring an isomorphism with any module (here, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) results in an isomorphism.

Thus, the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s tackle this problem step by step. The question is: if we have a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \), and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, can we conclude that the induced map on the first homology group with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) coefficients, \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \), is also an isomorphism?

First, let me recall some basic concepts. The fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) is the group of loops based at a point in \( X \), up to homotopy. The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), which means we take \( \pi_1(X) \) and make it abelian by quotienting out the commutator subgroup. For coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is the first homology group with coefficients in the abelian group \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). I think this is equivalent to taking the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \) and then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Given that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, we should consider what happens when we pass to the abelianization. Since the abelianization is a functor, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) should also be an isomorphism. Then, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is a right-exact functor, should preserve the isomorphism because tensoring an isomorphism with any module is still an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism as well.

Wait, but hold on. The fundamental group is non-abelian. Does that affect anything? Let me think. The key point is that even though \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is just the largest abelian quotient. If \( \pi_1(f) \) is an automorphism, then it should induce an automorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is also an isomorphism. Then, since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a field (well, a ring, but a simple one), tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) over \( \mathbb{Z} \) would preserve the isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But is there any possible catch here? Let me check with an example. Take a space with a non-abelian fundamental group, say a wedge of two circles. Wait, no, the fundamental group of a wedge of two circles is the free group on two generators, which is non-abelian. If we have a map inducing an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), then the induced map on \( H_1 \) with any coefficients should also be an isomorphism. For example, if the map swaps the two circles, that would induce an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), and correspondingly on \( H_1 \), even with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Alternatively, consider a more complicated space, like a surface. Take a closed orientable surface of genus \( g \geq 2 \). Its fundamental group is non-abelian, and any homeomorphism would induce an automorphism on \( \pi_1 \), hence on \( H_1 \), and tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. So in these examples, it seems to hold.

But maybe there&#x27;s a case where the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, but the map on \( H_1 \) with coefficients isn&#x27;t? Let me think. Suppose we have a group \( G \) and an automorphism \( \phi: G \to G \). Then, the induced map on the abelianization \( G^{ab} \) is \( \phi^{ab}: G^{ab} \to G^{ab} \). If \( \phi \) is an automorphism, then \( \phi^{ab} \) must also be an automorphism. Because the kernel of the abelianization is the commutator subgroup, which is characteristic, hence preserved under automorphisms. Therefore, the induced map on \( G^{ab} \) is indeed an automorphism.

Then, since \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) = H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a flat \( \mathbb{Z} \)-module (because it&#x27;s torsion-free? Wait, no, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is torsion. Wait, flatness over \( \mathbb{Z} \) requires that the module is torsion-free, which \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not. So tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not exact. But we have that if \( f: A \to B \) is an isomorphism of abelian groups, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to B \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is also an isomorphism. Because if \( f \) is an isomorphism, then it&#x27;s a bijective homomorphism, and tensoring with a module preserves bijectivity? Wait, no. Wait, tensoring can kill torsion. For example, if \( A \) is a free abelian group of rank 1, and \( f: A \to A \) is multiplication by 3, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is the zero map, even though \( f \) is injective. But in our case, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, so tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. Because if a map between free abelian groups is an isomorphism, then tensoring with any module would give an isomorphism. Wait, but \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) might have torsion. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion coprime to 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) might kill that torsion. But if the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then it has to preserve the torsion subgroups. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) splits as free part plus torsion, and the map is an isomorphism on each part, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would map the torsion parts accordingly. Wait, but tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would annihilate any torsion coprime to 3, but preserve 3-torsion. However, the induced map on \( H_1(-; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is not just the tensor product of the integral homology map with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? Wait, actually, by the universal coefficient theorem, we have a split exact sequence:

\( 0 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \to \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \to 0 \).

But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so the Tor term vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Therefore, the induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would give an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then when we tensor it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), is the resulting map necessarily an isomorphism?

Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is, say, \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the induced map is still an isomorphism. If \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion, say \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would kill the \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) part, so \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Then, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the same as the induced map on the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is an isomorphism. Wait, but the torsion part is annihilated, so does the original map have to act as an isomorphism on the free part? Well, since \( f \) induces an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it has to preserve the free and torsion parts. So, if the free part is \( \mathbb{Z}^n \), and the torsion part is some finite abelian group, then \( f \) acts as an isomorphism on each. Then, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3^n \), and the torsion part with orders coprime to 3 are killed. But the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would only see the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the 3-torsion parts. However, since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the map remains an isomorphism on the components that survive. Therefore, even if there is torsion in \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), as long as the original map is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me test with a specific example where \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has 3-torsion. Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Then, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Wait, \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), because \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Now, if we have an automorphism \( f \) on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it would act as an automorphism on the free part \( \mathbb{Z} \) and on the torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Therefore, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z} \) becomes an automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). The torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \) tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is still \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), and the automorphism there is preserved. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the direct sum of these two automorphisms, hence an automorphism.

Therefore, even in the presence of torsion, as long as the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

But wait, is the assumption that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism sufficient to guarantee that \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism? Yes, because \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), and any isomorphism at the level of \( \pi_1 \) will descend to an isomorphism on the abelianization.

But by universal coefficients, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so Tor vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). So, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is isomorphic to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Suppose the fundamental group is non-abelian, so its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is a quotient. If the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, then it must preserve the commutator subgroup, so the induced map on the quotient \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism. Then, as above, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the non-abelianness, the conclusion holds.

Therefore, the answer should be yes. But let me check if there is a possible mistake in assuming that tensoring an isomorphism with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. If the original map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then each component (free and torsion) is an isomorphism. Tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would then either kill torsion components not divisible by 3 or preserve them if they are. However, since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, it must map torsion subgroups to themselves isomorphically. Therefore, if there is 3-torsion, it&#x27;s preserved; if there is torsion not divisible by 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) annihilates them, but since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1 \), the induced map on the remaining part (the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) and the 3-torsion) would still be an isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the coefficients, as long as the original map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}_3) \) is as well.

Therefore, I think the answer is yes, we can deduce that \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

Given a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, we need to determine if the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3): H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \to H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

1. **Fundamental Group and Homology**: The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \). Since \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, it induces an isomorphism on the abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \).

2. **Coefficient Change**: The first homology group with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \), can be obtained using the universal coefficient theorem. This theorem states that \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). Since \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, the Tor term vanishes, simplifying to \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

3. **Induced Map on Homology**: The induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is equivalent to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. This is because tensoring an isomorphism with any module (here, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) results in an isomorphism.

Thus, the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s tackle this problem step by step. The question is: if we have a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \), and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, can we conclude that the induced map on the first homology group with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) coefficients, \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \), is also an isomorphism?

First, let me recall some basic concepts. The fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) is the group of loops based at a point in \( X \), up to homotopy. The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), which means we take \( \pi_1(X) \) and make it abelian by quotienting out the commutator subgroup. For coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is the first homology group with coefficients in the abelian group \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). I think this is equivalent to taking the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \) and then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Given that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, we should consider what happens when we pass to the abelianization. Since the abelianization is a functor, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) should also be an isomorphism. Then, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is a right-exact functor, should preserve the isomorphism because tensoring an isomorphism with any module is still an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism as well.

Wait, but hold on. The fundamental group is non-abelian. Does that affect anything? Let me think. The key point is that even though \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is just the largest abelian quotient. If \( \pi_1(f) \) is an automorphism, then it should induce an automorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is also an isomorphism. Then, since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a field (well, a ring, but a simple one), tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) over \( \mathbb{Z} \) would preserve the isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But is there any possible catch here? Let me check with an example. Take a space with a non-abelian fundamental group, say a wedge of two circles. Wait, no, the fundamental group of a wedge of two circles is the free group on two generators, which is non-abelian. If we have a map inducing an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), then the induced map on \( H_1 \) with any coefficients should also be an isomorphism. For example, if the map swaps the two circles, that would induce an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), and correspondingly on \( H_1 \), even with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Alternatively, consider a more complicated space, like a surface. Take a closed orientable surface of genus \( g \geq 2 \). Its fundamental group is non-abelian, and any homeomorphism would induce an automorphism on \( \pi_1 \), hence on \( H_1 \), and tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. So in these examples, it seems to hold.

But maybe there&#x27;s a case where the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, but the map on \( H_1 \) with coefficients isn&#x27;t? Let me think. Suppose we have a group \( G \) and an automorphism \( \phi: G \to G \). Then, the induced map on the abelianization \( G^{ab} \) is \( \phi^{ab}: G^{ab} \to G^{ab} \). If \( \phi \) is an automorphism, then \( \phi^{ab} \) must also be an automorphism. Because the kernel of the abelianization is the commutator subgroup, which is characteristic, hence preserved under automorphisms. Therefore, the induced map on \( G^{ab} \) is indeed an automorphism.

Then, since \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) = H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a flat \( \mathbb{Z} \)-module (because it&#x27;s torsion-free? Wait, no, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is torsion. Wait, flatness over \( \mathbb{Z} \) requires that the module is torsion-free, which \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not. So tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not exact. But we have that if \( f: A \to B \) is an isomorphism of abelian groups, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to B \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is also an isomorphism. Because if \( f \) is an isomorphism, then it&#x27;s a bijective homomorphism, and tensoring with a module preserves bijectivity? Wait, no. Wait, tensoring can kill torsion. For example, if \( A \) is a free abelian group of rank 1, and \( f: A \to A \) is multiplication by 3, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is the zero map, even though \( f \) is injective. But in our case, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, so tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. Because if a map between free abelian groups is an isomorphism, then tensoring with any module would give an isomorphism. Wait, but \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) might have torsion. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion coprime to 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) might kill that torsion. But if the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then it has to preserve the torsion subgroups. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) splits as free part plus torsion, and the map is an isomorphism on each part, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would map the torsion parts accordingly. Wait, but tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would annihilate any torsion coprime to 3, but preserve 3-torsion. However, the induced map on \( H_1(-; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is not just the tensor product of the integral homology map with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? Wait, actually, by the universal coefficient theorem, we have a split exact sequence:

\( 0 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \to \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \to 0 \).

But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so the Tor term vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Therefore, the induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would give an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then when we tensor it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), is the resulting map necessarily an isomorphism?

Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is, say, \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the induced map is still an isomorphism. If \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion, say \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would kill the \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) part, so \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Then, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the same as the induced map on the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is an isomorphism. Wait, but the torsion part is annihilated, so does the original map have to act as an isomorphism on the free part? Well, since \( f \) induces an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it has to preserve the free and torsion parts. So, if the free part is \( \mathbb{Z}^n \), and the torsion part is some finite abelian group, then \( f \) acts as an isomorphism on each. Then, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3^n \), and the torsion part with orders coprime to 3 are killed. But the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would only see the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the 3-torsion parts. However, since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the map remains an isomorphism on the components that survive. Therefore, even if there is torsion in \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), as long as the original map is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me test with a specific example where \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has 3-torsion. Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Then, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Wait, \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), because \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Now, if we have an automorphism \( f \) on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it would act as an automorphism on the free part \( \mathbb{Z} \) and on the torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Therefore, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z} \) becomes an automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). The torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \) tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is still \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), and the automorphism there is preserved. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the direct sum of these two automorphisms, hence an automorphism.

Therefore, even in the presence of torsion, as long as the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

But wait, is the assumption that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism sufficient to guarantee that \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism? Yes, because \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), and any isomorphism at the level of \( \pi_1 \) will descend to an isomorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is necessarily an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1(X) \) is abelian or not. Therefore, even if \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, as long as \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on homology with any coefficients (including \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) should be an isomorphism.

However, the problem states that \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian. Does that affect the argument? I don&#x27;t think so. The key point is that the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, which implies the induced map on \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1 \) was abelian or not. The non-abelianness of \( \pi_1(X) \) might just be a hint that the abelianization is non-trivial, but even if \( \pi_1(X) \) were abelian, the same conclusion would hold.

Therefore, unless there&#x27;s some subtlety I&#x27;m missing here, the answer should be yes, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me check one more angle. Suppose \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, so the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is an isomorphism. But by universal coefficients, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so Tor vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). So, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is isomorphic to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

So in these examples, it seems to hold.

But maybe there&#x27;s a case where the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, but the map on \( H_1 \) with coefficients isn&#x27;t? Let me think. Suppose we have a group \( G \) and an automorphism \( \phi: G \to G \). Then, the induced map on the abelianization \( G^{ab} \) is \( \phi^{ab}: G^{ab} \to G^{ab} \). If \( \phi \) is an automorphism, then \( \phi^{ab} \) must also be an automorphism. Because the kernel of the abelianization is the commutator subgroup, which is characteristic, hence preserved under automorphisms. Therefore, the induced map on \( G^{ab} \) is indeed an automorphism.

Then, since \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) = H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a flat \( \mathbb{Z} \)-module (because it&#x27;s torsion-free? Wait, no, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is torsion. Wait, flatness over \( \mathbb{Z} \) requires that the module is torsion-free, which \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not. So tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not exact. But we have that if \( f: A \to B \) is an isomorphism of abelian groups, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to B \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is also an isomorphism. Because if \( f \) is an isomorphism, then it&#x27;s a bijective homomorphism, and tensoring with a module preserves bijectivity? Wait, no. Wait, tensoring can kill torsion. For example, if \( A \) is a free abelian group of rank 1, and \( f: A \to A \) is multiplication by 3, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is the zero map, even though \( f \) is injective. But in our case, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, so tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. Because if a map between free abelian groups is an isomorphism, then tensoring with any module would give an isomorphism. Wait, but \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) might have torsion. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion coprime to 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) might kill that torsion. But if the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then it has to preserve the torsion subgroups. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) splits as free part plus torsion, and the map is an isomorphism on each part, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would map the torsion parts accordingly. Wait, but tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would annihilate any torsion coprime to 3, but preserve 3-torsion. However, the induced map on \( H_1(-; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is not just the tensor product of the integral homology map with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? Wait, actually, by the universal coefficient theorem, we have a split exact sequence:

\( 0 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \to \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \to 0 \).

But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so the Tor term vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Therefore, the induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would give an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then when we tensor it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), is the resulting map necessarily an isomorphism?

Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is, say, \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the induced map is still an isomorphism. If \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion, say \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would kill the \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) part, so \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Then, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the same as the induced map on the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is an isomorphism. Wait, but the torsion part is annihilated, so does the original map have to act as an isomorphism on the free part? Well, since \( f \) induces an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it has to preserve the free and torsion parts. So, if the free part is \( \mathbb{Z}^n \), and the torsion part is some finite abelian group, then \( f \) acts as an isomorphism on each. Then, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3^n \), and the torsion part with orders coprime to 3 are killed. But the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would only see the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the 3-torsion parts. However, since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the map remains an isomorphism on the components that survive. Therefore, even if there is torsion in \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), as long as the original map is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me test with a specific example where \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has 3-torsion. Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Then, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Wait, \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), because \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Now, if we have an automorphism \( f \) on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it would act as an automorphism on the free part \( \mathbb{Z} \) and on the torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Therefore, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z} \) becomes an automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). The torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \) tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is still \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), and the automorphism there is preserved. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the direct sum of these two automorphisms, hence an automorphism.

Therefore, even in the presence of torsion, as long as the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

But wait, is the assumption that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism sufficient to guarantee that \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism? Yes, because \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), and any isomorphism at the level of \( \pi_1 \) will descend to an isomorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is necessarily an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1(X) \) is abelian or not. Therefore, even if \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, as long as \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on homology with any coefficients (including \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) should be an isomorphism.

However, the problem states that \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian. Does that affect the argument? I don&#x27;t think so. The key point is that the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, which implies the induced map on \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1 \) was abelian or not. The non-abelianness of \( \pi_1(X) \) might just be a hint that the abelianization is non-trivial, but even if \( \pi_1(X) \) were abelian, the same conclusion would hold.

Therefore, unless there&#x27;s some subtlety I&#x27;m missing here, the answer should be yes, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me check one more angle. Suppose \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, so the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is an isomorphism. But by universal coefficients, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so Tor vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). So, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is isomorphic to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Suppose the fundamental group is non-abelian, so its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is a quotient. If the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, then it must preserve the commutator subgroup, so the induced map on the quotient \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism. Then, as above, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the non-abelianness, the conclusion holds.

Therefore, the answer should be yes. But let me check if there is a possible mistake in assuming that tensoring an isomorphism with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. If the original map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then each component (free and torsion) is an isomorphism. Tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would then either kill torsion components not divisible by 3 or preserve them if they are. However, since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, it must map torsion subgroups to themselves isomorphically. Therefore, if there is 3-torsion, it&#x27;s preserved; if there is torsion not divisible by 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) annihilates them, but since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1 \), the induced map on the remaining part (the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) and the 3-torsion) would still be an isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the coefficients, as long as the original map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}_3) \) is as well.

Therefore, I think the answer is yes, we can deduce that \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, we need to determine if the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3): H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \to H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

1. **Fundamental Group and Homology**: The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \). Since \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, it induces an isomorphism on the abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \).

2. **Coefficient Change**: The first homology group with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \), can be obtained using the universal coefficient theorem. This theorem states that \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). Since \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, the Tor term vanishes, simplifying to \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

3. **Induced Map on Homology**: The induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is equivalent to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. This is because tensoring an isomorphism with any module (here, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) results in an isomorphism.

Thus, the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s tackle this problem step by step. The question is: if we have a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \), and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, can we conclude that the induced map on the first homology group with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) coefficients, \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \), is also an isomorphism?

First, let me recall some basic concepts. The fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) is the group of loops based at a point in \( X \), up to homotopy. The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), which means we take \( \pi_1(X) \) and make it abelian by quotienting out the commutator subgroup. For coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is the first homology group with coefficients in the abelian group \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). I think this is equivalent to taking the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \) and then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Given that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, we should consider what happens when we pass to the abelianization. Since the abelianization is a functor, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) should also be an isomorphism. Then, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is a right-exact functor, should preserve the isomorphism because tensoring an isomorphism with any module is still an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism as well.

Wait, but hold on. The fundamental group is non-abelian. Does that affect anything? Let me think. The key point is that even though \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is just the largest abelian quotient. If \( \pi_1(f) \) is an automorphism, then it should induce an automorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is also an isomorphism. Then, since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a field (well, a ring, but a simple one), tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) over \( \mathbb{Z} \) would preserve the isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But is there any possible catch here? Let me check with an example. Take a space with a non-abelian fundamental group, say a wedge of two circles. Wait, no, the fundamental group of a wedge of two circles is the free group on two generators, which is non-abelian. If we have a map inducing an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), then the induced map on \( H_1 \) with any coefficients should also be an isomorphism. For example, if the map swaps the two circles, that would induce an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), and correspondingly on \( H_1 \), even with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Alternatively, consider a more complicated space, like a surface. Take a closed orientable surface of genus \( g \geq 2 \). Its fundamental group is non-abelian, and any homeomorphism would induce an automorphism on \( \pi_1 \), hence on \( H_1 \), and tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. So in these examples, it seems to hold.

But maybe there&#x27;s a case where the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, but the map on \( H_1 \) with coefficients isn&#x27;t? Let me think. Suppose we have a group \( G \) and an automorphism \( \phi: G \to G \). Then, the induced map on the abelianization \( G^{ab} \) is \( \phi^{ab}: G^{ab} \to G^{ab} \). If \( \phi \) is an automorphism, then \( \phi^{ab} \) must also be an automorphism. Because the kernel of the abelianization is the commutator subgroup, which is characteristic, hence preserved under automorphisms. Therefore, the induced map on \( G^{ab} \) is indeed an automorphism.

Then, since \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) = H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a flat \( \mathbb{Z} \)-module (because it&#x27;s torsion-free? Wait, no, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is torsion. Wait, flatness over \( \mathbb{Z} \) requires that the module is torsion-free, which \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not. So tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not exact. But we have that if \( f: A \to B \) is an isomorphism of abelian groups, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to B \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is also an isomorphism. Because if \( f \) is an isomorphism, then it&#x27;s a bijective homomorphism, and tensoring with a module preserves bijectivity? Wait, no. Wait, tensoring can kill torsion. For example, if \( A \) is a free abelian group of rank 1, and \( f: A \to A \) is multiplication by 3, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is the zero map, even though \( f \) is injective. But in our case, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, so tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. Because if a map between free abelian groups is an isomorphism, then tensoring with any module would give an isomorphism. Wait, but \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) might have torsion. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion coprime to 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) might kill that torsion. But if the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then it has to preserve the torsion subgroups. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) splits as free part plus torsion, and the map is an isomorphism on each part, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would map the torsion parts accordingly. Wait, but tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would annihilate any torsion coprime to 3, but preserve 3-torsion. However, the induced map on \( H_1(-; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is not just the tensor product of the integral homology map with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? Wait, actually, by the universal coefficient theorem, we have a split exact sequence:

\( 0 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \to \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \to 0 \).

But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so the Tor term vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Therefore, the induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would give an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then when we tensor it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), is the resulting map necessarily an isomorphism?

Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is, say, \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the induced map is still an isomorphism. If \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion, say \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would kill the \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) part, so \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Then, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the same as the induced map on the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is an isomorphism. Wait, but the torsion part is annihilated, so does the original map have to act as an isomorphism on the free part? Well, since \( f \) induces an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it has to preserve the free and torsion parts. So, if the free part is \( \mathbb{Z}^n \), and the torsion part is some finite abelian group, then \( f \) acts as an isomorphism on each. Then, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3^n \), and the torsion part with orders coprime to 3 are killed. But the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would only see the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the 3-torsion parts. However, since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the map remains an isomorphism on the components that survive. Therefore, even if there is torsion in \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), as long as the original map is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me test with a specific example where \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has 3-torsion. Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Then, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Wait, \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), because \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Now, if we have an automorphism \( f \) on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it would act as an automorphism on the free part \( \mathbb{Z} \) and on the torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Therefore, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z} \) becomes an automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). The torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \) tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is still \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), and the automorphism there is preserved. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the direct sum of these two automorphisms, hence an automorphism.

Therefore, even in the presence of torsion, as long as the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

But wait, is the assumption that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism sufficient to guarantee that \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism? Yes, because \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), and any isomorphism at the level of \( \pi_1 \) will descend to an isomorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is necessarily an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1(X) \) is abelian or not. Therefore, even if \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, as long as \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on homology with any coefficients (including \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) should be an isomorphism.

However, the problem states that \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian. Does that affect the argument? I don&#x27;t think so. The key point is that the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, which implies the induced map on \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1 \) was abelian or not. The non-abelianness of \( \pi_1(X) \) might just be a hint that the abelianization is non-trivial, but even if \( \pi_1(X) \) were abelian, the same conclusion would hold.

Therefore, unless there&#x27;s some subtlety I&#x27;m missing here, the answer should be yes, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me check one more angle. Suppose \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, so the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is an isomorphism. But by universal coefficients, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so Tor vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). So, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is isomorphic to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Suppose the fundamental group is non-abelian, so its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is a quotient. If the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, then it must preserve the commutator subgroup, so the induced map on the quotient \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism. Then, as above, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the non-abelianness, the conclusion holds.

Therefore, the answer should be yes. But let me check if there is a possible mistake in assuming that tensoring an isomorphism with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. If the original map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then each component (free and torsion) is an isomorphism. Tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would then either kill torsion components not divisible by 3 or preserve them if they are. However, since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, it must map torsion subgroups to themselves isomorphically. Therefore, if there is 3-torsion, it&#x27;s preserved; if there is torsion not divisible by 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) annihilates them, but since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1 \), the induced map on the remaining part (the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) and the 3-torsion) would still be an isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the coefficients, as long as the original map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}_3) \) is as well.

Therefore, I think the answer is yes, we can deduce that \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}

Given a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, we need to determine if the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3): H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \to H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

1. **Fundamental Group and Homology**: The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \). Since \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, it induces an isomorphism on the abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \).

2. **Coefficient Change**: The first homology group with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \), can be obtained using the universal coefficient theorem. This theorem states that \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). Since \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, the Tor term vanishes, simplifying to \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

3. **Induced Map on Homology**: The induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is equivalent to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. This is because tensoring an isomorphism with any module (here, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) results in an isomorphism.

Thus, the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s tackle this problem step by step. The question is: if we have a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \), and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, can we conclude that the induced map on the first homology group with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) coefficients, \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \), is also an isomorphism?

First, let me recall some basic concepts. The fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) is the group of loops based at a point in \( X \), up to homotopy. The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), which means we take \( \pi_1(X) \) and make it abelian by quotienting out the commutator subgroup. For coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is the first homology group with coefficients in the abelian group \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). I think this is equivalent to taking the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \) and then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Given that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, we should consider what happens when we pass to the abelianization. Since the abelianization is a functor, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) should also be an isomorphism. Then, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is a right-exact functor, should preserve the isomorphism because tensoring an isomorphism with any module is still an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism as well.

Wait, but hold on. The fundamental group is non-abelian. Does that affect anything? Let me think. The key point is that even though \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is just the largest abelian quotient. If \( \pi_1(f) \) is an automorphism, then it should induce an automorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is also an isomorphism. Then, since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a field (well, a ring, but a simple one), tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) over \( \mathbb{Z} \) would preserve the isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But is there any possible catch here? Let me check with an example. Take a space with a non-abelian fundamental group, say a wedge of two circles. Wait, no, the fundamental group of a wedge of two circles is the free group on two generators, which is non-abelian. If we have a map inducing an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), then the induced map on \( H_1 \) with any coefficients should also be an isomorphism. For example, if the map swaps the two circles, that would induce an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), and correspondingly on \( H_1 \), even with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Alternatively, consider a more complicated space, like a surface. Take a closed orientable surface of genus \( g \geq 2 \). Its fundamental group is non-abelian, and any homeomorphism would induce an automorphism on \( \pi_1 \), hence on \( H_1 \), and tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. So in these examples, it seems to hold.

But maybe there&#x27;s a case where the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, but the map on \( H_1 \) with coefficients isn&#x27;t? Let me think. Suppose we have a group \( G \) and an automorphism \( \phi: G \to G \). Then, the induced map on the abelianization \( G^{ab} \) is \( \phi^{ab}: G^{ab} \to G^{ab} \). If \( \phi \) is an automorphism, then \( \phi^{ab} \) must also be an automorphism. Because the kernel of the abelianization is the commutator subgroup, which is characteristic, hence preserved under automorphisms. Therefore, the induced map on \( G^{ab} \) is indeed an automorphism.

Then, since \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) = H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a flat \( \mathbb{Z} \)-module (because it&#x27;s torsion-free? Wait, no, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is torsion. Wait, flatness over \( \mathbb{Z} \) requires that the module is torsion-free, which \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not. So tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not exact. But we have that if \( f: A \to B \) is an isomorphism of abelian groups, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to B \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is also an isomorphism. Because if \( f \) is an isomorphism, then it&#x27;s a bijective homomorphism, and tensoring with a module preserves bijectivity? Wait, no. Wait, tensoring can kill torsion. For example, if \( A \) is a free abelian group of rank 1, and \( f: A \to A \) is multiplication by 3, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is the zero map, even though \( f \) is injective. But in our case, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, so tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. Because if a map between free abelian groups is an isomorphism, then tensoring with any module would give an isomorphism. Wait, but \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) might have torsion. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion coprime to 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) might kill that torsion. But if the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then it has to preserve the torsion subgroups. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) splits as free part plus torsion, and the map is an isomorphism on each part, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would map the torsion parts accordingly. Wait, but tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would annihilate any torsion coprime to 3, but preserve 3-torsion. However, the induced map on \( H_1(-; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is not just the tensor product of the integral homology map with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? Wait, actually, by the universal coefficient theorem, we have a split exact sequence:

\( 0 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \to \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \to 0 \).

But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so the Tor term vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Therefore, the induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would give an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then when we tensor it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), is the resulting map necessarily an isomorphism?

Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is, say, \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the induced map is still an isomorphism. If \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion, say \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would kill the \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) part, so \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Then, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the same as the induced map on the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is an isomorphism. Wait, but the torsion part is annihilated, so does the original map have to act as an isomorphism on the free part? Well, since \( f \) induces an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it has to preserve the free and torsion parts. So, if the free part is \( \mathbb{Z}^n \), and the torsion part is some finite abelian group, then \( f \) acts as an isomorphism on each. Then, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3^n \), and the torsion part with orders coprime to 3 are killed. But the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would only see the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the 3-torsion parts. However, since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the map remains an isomorphism on the components that survive. Therefore, even if there is torsion in \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), as long as the original map is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me test with a specific example where \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has 3-torsion. Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Then, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Wait, \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), because \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Now, if we have an automorphism \( f \) on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it would act as an automorphism on the free part \( \mathbb{Z} \) and on the torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Therefore, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z} \) becomes an automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). The torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \) tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is still \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), and the automorphism there is preserved. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the direct sum of these two automorphisms, hence an automorphism.

Therefore, even in the presence of torsion, as long as the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

But wait, is the assumption that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism sufficient to guarantee that \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism? Yes, because \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), and any isomorphism at the level of \( \pi_1 \) will descend to an isomorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is necessarily an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1(X) \) is abelian or not. Therefore, even if \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, as long as \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on homology with any coefficients (including \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) should be an isomorphism.

However, the problem states that \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian. Does that affect the argument? I don&#x27;t think so. The key point is that the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, which implies the induced map on \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1 \) was abelian or not. The non-abelianness of \( \pi_1(X) \) might just be a hint that the abelianization is non-trivial, but even if \( \pi_1(X) \) were abelian, the same conclusion would hold.

Therefore, unless there&#x27;s some subtlety I&#x27;m missing here, the answer should be yes, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

But by universal coefficients, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so Tor vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). So, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is isomorphic to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

If we have a map inducing an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), then the induced map on \( H_1 \) with any coefficients should also be an isomorphism. For example, if the map swaps the two circles, that would induce an isomorphism on \( \pi_1 \), and correspondingly on \( H_1 \), even with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Alternatively, consider a more complicated space, like a surface. Take a closed orientable surface of genus \( g \geq 2 \). Its fundamental group is non-abelian, and any homeomorphism would induce an automorphism on \( \pi_1 \), hence on \( H_1 \), and tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. So in these examples, it seems to hold.

But maybe there&#x27;s a case where the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, but the map on \( H_1 \) with coefficients isn&#x27;t? Let me think. Suppose we have a group \( G \) and an automorphism \( \phi: G \to G \). Then, the induced map on the abelianization \( G^{ab} \) is \( \phi^{ab}: G^{ab} \to G^{ab} \). If \( \phi \) is an automorphism, then \( \phi^{ab} \) must also be an automorphism. Because the kernel of the abelianization is the commutator subgroup, which is characteristic, hence preserved under automorphisms. Therefore, the induced map on \( G^{ab} \) is indeed an automorphism.

Then, since \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) = H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a flat \( \mathbb{Z} \)-module (because it&#x27;s torsion-free? Wait, no, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is torsion. Wait, flatness over \( \mathbb{Z} \) requires that the module is torsion-free, which \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not. So tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not exact. But we have that if \( f: A \to B \) is an isomorphism of abelian groups, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to B \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is also an isomorphism. Because if \( f \) is an isomorphism, then it&#x27;s a bijective homomorphism, and tensoring with a module preserves bijectivity? Wait, no. Wait, tensoring can kill torsion. For example, if \( A \) is a free abelian group of rank 1, and \( f: A \to A \) is multiplication by 3, then \( f \otimes \text{id}: A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to A \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is the zero map, even though \( f \) is injective. But in our case, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, so tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would preserve that. Because if a map between free abelian groups is an isomorphism, then tensoring with any module would give an isomorphism. Wait, but \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) might have torsion. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion coprime to 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) might kill that torsion. But if the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then it has to preserve the torsion subgroups. So, if \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) splits as free part plus torsion, and the map is an isomorphism on each part, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would map the torsion parts accordingly. Wait, but tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would annihilate any torsion coprime to 3, but preserve 3-torsion. However, the induced map on \( H_1(-; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is not just the tensor product of the integral homology map with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? Wait, actually, by the universal coefficient theorem, we have a split exact sequence:

\( 0 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \to \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \to 0 \).

But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so the Tor term vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Therefore, the induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would give an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then when we tensor it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), is the resulting map necessarily an isomorphism?

Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is, say, \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the induced map is still an isomorphism. If \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion, say \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would kill the \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) part, so \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Then, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the same as the induced map on the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is an isomorphism. Wait, but the torsion part is annihilated, so does the original map have to act as an isomorphism on the free part? Well, since \( f \) induces an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it has to preserve the free and torsion parts. So, if the free part is \( \mathbb{Z}^n \), and the torsion part is some finite abelian group, then \( f \) acts as an isomorphism on each. Then, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3^n \), and the torsion part with orders coprime to 3 are killed. But the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would only see the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the 3-torsion parts. However, since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the map remains an isomorphism on the components that survive. Therefore, even if there is torsion in \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), as long as the original map is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me test with a specific example where \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has 3-torsion. Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Then, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Wait, \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), because \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Now, if we have an automorphism \( f \) on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it would act as an automorphism on the free part \( \mathbb{Z} \) and on the torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Therefore, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z} \) becomes an automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). The torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \) tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is still \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), and the automorphism there is preserved. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the direct sum of these two automorphisms, hence an automorphism.

Therefore, even in the presence of torsion, as long as the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

But wait, is the assumption that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism sufficient to guarantee that \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism? Yes, because \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), and any isomorphism at the level of \( \pi_1 \) will descend to an isomorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is necessarily an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1(X) \) is abelian or not. Therefore, even if \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, as long as \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on homology with any coefficients (including \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) should be an isomorphism.

However, the problem states that \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian. Does that affect the argument? I don&#x27;t think so. The key point is that the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, which implies the induced map on \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1 \) was abelian or not. The non-abelianness of \( \pi_1(X) \) might just be a hint that the abelianization is non-trivial, but even if \( \pi_1(X) \) were abelian, the same conclusion would hold.

Therefore, unless there&#x27;s some subtlety I&#x27;m missing here, the answer should be yes, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me check one more angle. Suppose \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, so the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is an isomorphism. But by universal coefficients, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so Tor vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). So, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is isomorphic to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Suppose the fundamental group is non-abelian, so its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is a quotient. If the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, then it must preserve the commutator subgroup, so the induced map on the quotient \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism. Then, as above, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the non-abelianness, the conclusion holds.

Therefore, the answer should be yes. But let me check if there is a possible mistake in assuming that tensoring an isomorphism with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. If the original map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then each component (free and torsion) is an isomorphism. Tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would then either kill torsion components not divisible by 3 or preserve them if they are. However, since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, it must map torsion subgroups to themselves isomorphically. Therefore, if there is 3-torsion, it&#x27;s preserved; if there is torsion not divisible by 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) annihilates them, but since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1 \), the induced map on the remaining part (the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) and the 3-torsion) would still be an isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the coefficients, as long as the original map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}_3) \) is as well.

Therefore, I think the answer is yes, we can deduce that \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, we need to determine if the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3): H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \to H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

1. **Fundamental Group and Homology**: The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \). Since \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, it induces an isomorphism on the abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \).

2. **Coefficient Change**: The first homology group with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \), can be obtained using the universal coefficient theorem. This theorem states that \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). Since \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, the Tor term vanishes, simplifying to \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

3. **Induced Map on Homology**: The induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is equivalent to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. This is because tensoring an isomorphism with any module (here, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) results in an isomorphism.

Thus, the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Reference Answer: Alright, let&#x27;s tackle this problem step by step. The question is: if we have a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \), and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, can we conclude that the induced map on the first homology group with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) coefficients, \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \), is also an isomorphism?

First, let me recall some basic concepts. The fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) is the group of loops based at a point in \( X \), up to homotopy. The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), which means we take \( \pi_1(X) \) and make it abelian by quotienting out the commutator subgroup. For coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is the first homology group with coefficients in the abelian group \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). I think this is equivalent to taking the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \) and then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), right? So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Given that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, we should consider what happens when we pass to the abelianization. Since the abelianization is a functor, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) should also be an isomorphism. Then, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is a right-exact functor, should preserve the isomorphism because tensoring an isomorphism with any module is still an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism as well.

Wait, but hold on. The fundamental group is non-abelian. Does that affect anything? Let me think. The key point is that even though \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is just the largest abelian quotient. If \( \pi_1(f) \) is an automorphism, then it should induce an automorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is also an isomorphism. Then, since \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a field (well, a ring, but a simple one), tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) over \( \mathbb{Z} \) would preserve the isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

But is there any possible catch here? Let me check with an example. Take a space with a non-abelian fundamental group, say a wedge of two circles. Wait, no, the fundamental group of a wedge of two circles is the free group on two generators, which is non-abelian.

So tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is not exact.

\( 0 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \to H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \to \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \to 0 \).

But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so the Tor term vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

Therefore, the induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would give an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is, say, \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the induced map is still an isomorphism. If \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has torsion, say \( \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \), and \( f \) induces an isomorphism. Then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would kill the \( \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) part, so \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Then, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the same as the induced map on the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), which is an isomorphism. Wait, but the torsion part is annihilated, so does the original map have to act as an isomorphism on the free part? Well, since \( f \) induces an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it has to preserve the free and torsion parts. So, if the free part is \( \mathbb{Z}^n \), and the torsion part is some finite abelian group, then \( f \) acts as an isomorphism on each. Then, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3^n \), and the torsion part with orders coprime to 3 are killed. But the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would only see the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the 3-torsion parts. However, since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the map remains an isomorphism on the components that survive. Therefore, even if there is torsion in \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), as long as the original map is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) should be an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me test with a specific example where \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) has 3-torsion. Suppose \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Then, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). Wait, \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), because \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). So, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Now, if we have an automorphism \( f \) on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), it would act as an automorphism on the free part \( \mathbb{Z} \) and on the torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \). Therefore, when we tensor with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), the free part becomes \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), and the automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z} \) becomes an automorphism on \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). The torsion part \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \) tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is still \( \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z} \), and the automorphism there is preserved. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) would be the direct sum of these two automorphisms, hence an automorphism.

Therefore, even in the presence of torsion, as long as the original map is an isomorphism on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \), then the induced map on \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

But wait, is the assumption that \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism sufficient to guarantee that \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism? Yes, because \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \), and any isomorphism at the level of \( \pi_1 \) will descend to an isomorphism on the abelianization. So, if \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, then \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is necessarily an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1(X) \) is abelian or not. Therefore, even if \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian, as long as \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on homology with any coefficients (including \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) should be an isomorphism.

However, the problem states that \( \pi_1(X) \) is non-abelian. Does that affect the argument? I don&#x27;t think so. The key point is that the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, which implies the induced map on \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism, regardless of whether \( \pi_1 \) was abelian or not. The non-abelianness of \( \pi_1(X) \) might just be a hint that the abelianization is non-trivial, but even if \( \pi_1(X) \) were abelian, the same conclusion would hold.

Therefore, unless there&#x27;s some subtlety I&#x27;m missing here, the answer should be yes, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

Wait, but let me check one more angle. Suppose \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, so the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism. Therefore, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is an isomorphism. But by universal coefficients, \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). But \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, so Tor vanishes, hence \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \). So, the map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is isomorphic to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. Therefore, \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, hold on. Let me think again. Suppose the fundamental group is non-abelian, so its abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is a quotient. If the induced map on \( \pi_1 \) is an isomorphism, then it must preserve the commutator subgroup, so the induced map on the quotient \( H_1 \) is an isomorphism. Then, as above, tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the non-abelianness, the conclusion holds.

Therefore, the answer should be yes. But let me check if there is a possible mistake in assuming that tensoring an isomorphism with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) gives an isomorphism. If the original map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, then each component (free and torsion) is an isomorphism. Tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) would then either kill torsion components not divisible by 3 or preserve them if they are. However, since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, it must map torsion subgroups to themselves isomorphically. Therefore, if there is 3-torsion, it&#x27;s preserved; if there is torsion not divisible by 3, then tensoring with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) annihilates them, but since the original map was an isomorphism on the entire \( H_1 \), the induced map on the remaining part (the free part tensored with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) and the 3-torsion) would still be an isomorphism. Therefore, regardless of the coefficients, as long as the original map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, the induced map on \( H_1(\mathbb{Z}_3) \) is as well.

Therefore, I think the answer is yes, we can deduce that \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is an isomorphism.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{Yes}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a topological space \( X \) with a non-abelian fundamental group \( \pi_1(X) \) and a map \( f: X \to X \) such that the induced map \( \pi_1(f): \pi_1(X) \to \pi_1(X) \) is an isomorphism, we need to determine if the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3): H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \to H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is also an isomorphism.

1. **Fundamental Group and Homology**: The first homology group \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is the abelianization of \( \pi_1(X) \). Since \( \pi_1(f) \) is an isomorphism, it induces an isomorphism on the abelianization \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \).

2. **Coefficient Change**: The first homology group with coefficients in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \), can be obtained using the universal coefficient theorem. This theorem states that \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \oplus \text{Tor}(H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z}_3) \). Since \( H_0(X; \mathbb{Z}) \) is free abelian, the Tor term vanishes, simplifying to \( H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}_3) \cong H_1(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \).

3. **Induced Map on Homology**: The induced map \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is equivalent to \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes \text{id}_{\mathbb{Z}_3} \). Since \( H_1(f; \mathbb{Z}) \) is an isomorphism, tensoring it with \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) preserves the isomorphism. This is because tensoring an isomorphism with any module (here, \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)) results in an isomorphism.

Thus, the induced map \( H_1(f, \mathbb{Z}_3) \) is indeed an isomorphism.

Reference Answer: Since $\phi(49) = 42$ (see Euler&#x27;s totient function), Euler&#x27;s Totient Theorem tells us that $a^{42} \equiv 1 \pmod{49}$ where $\text{gcd}(a,49) = 1$. Thus $6^{83} + 8^{83} \equiv 6^{2(42)-1}+8^{2(42)-1}$ $\equiv 6^{-1} + 8^{-1} \equiv \frac{8+6}{48}$ $\equiv \frac{14}{-1}\equiv \boxed{35} \pmod{49}$.          </p>

Reference Answer: Let&#x27;s start by rewriting this problem into equation form:

\begin{align*}
x + y &amp;= 40, \\
x - y &amp;= 12.
\end{align*}We want to find $xy$, so let&#x27;s find $x$ and $y$ separately.

Begin by adding the two equations:  \begin{align*}
2x &amp;= 52 \\
x &amp;= 26
\end{align*}Now, subtract the two equations \begin{align*}
2y &amp;= 28 \\
y &amp;= 14
\end{align*}So then $x \cdot y = 26 \cdot 14 = \boxed{364}$.          </p>
