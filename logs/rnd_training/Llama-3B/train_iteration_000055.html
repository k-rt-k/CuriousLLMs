Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), the equation \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) holds. Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall that \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) means the set of all non-negative integers, which includes 0, 1, 2, and so on. So the function \( f \) takes non-negative integers and maps them to non-negative integers. The condition given is that if I take two numbers \( m \) and \( n \), apply \( f \) to each of them, add the results together, and then apply \( f \) again, I should get \( m + n \). Interesting. So \( f \) composed with addition somehow inverts the process?

Maybe I should start by checking if there are any simple functions that satisfy this. The first one that comes to mind is the identity function, where \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let&#x27;s test that:

If \( f(k) = k \), then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + n) = m + n \), which matches the given condition. So the identity function works. But the problem says &quot;find all functions,&quot; so there might be others, or maybe the identity is the only solution.

But before jumping to conclusions, let&#x27;s see if there are other possibilities. Sometimes functions can be involutions, meaning that applying them twice gives the identity. But in this case, the functional equation isn&#x27;t exactly an involution; it&#x27;s more like a nested function. Let&#x27;s try to analyze the properties that such a function \( f \) must have.

First, is \( f \) injective? Suppose that \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then, for any \( m \), consider \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \). By the given equation, this implies \( m + a = m + b \), which would mean \( a = b \). Therefore, \( f \) is injective.

Okay, so injectivity is established. What about surjectivity? Let&#x27;s see. For any non-negative integer \( k \), we need to find some \( c \) such that \( f(c) = k \). Let&#x27;s pick an arbitrary \( k \). Suppose we set \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \). Then the equation becomes \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k + 0 = k \). Let&#x27;s denote \( c = f(k) + f(0) \). Then \( f(c) = k \). Therefore, for any \( k \), there exists such a \( c \), so \( f \) is surjective.

Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it&#x27;s bijective. That&#x27;s a good start. Bijections have well-defined inverse functions, but since we&#x27;re dealing with non-negative integers, the inverse might not necessarily be a function unless we&#x27;re careful. However, knowing that \( f \) is bijective can help us manipulate the equation.

Let me think. Since \( f \) is bijective, maybe we can express \( f(m) + f(n) \) in terms of the inverse function. Wait, but the equation given is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \). If I denote \( f(m) + f(n) \) as some input to \( f \), which outputs \( m + n \). If \( f \) is invertible, then \( f^{-1}(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \). But wait, inverses of functions on integers can be tricky because they might not exist unless the function is strictly increasing or decreasing. But since \( f \) is bijective, it must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing? Hmm, but in non-negative integers, strictly decreasing would eventually hit zero and negative numbers, which aren&#x27;t allowed. So \( f \) must be strictly increasing.

Therefore, \( f \) is a strictly increasing bijection. That&#x27;s helpful. So, for example, \( f(0) \) is the minimal value of \( f \), which must be 0 or some other number. Wait, but since \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and it&#x27;s a bijection, \( f(0) \) must be 0. Wait, let&#x27;s check that.

If \( f \) is a bijection from \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) to \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \), then it must map 0 to some number. Suppose \( f(0) = a \). Since it&#x27;s a bijection, \( a \) must be unique. Let&#x27;s plug \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \) into the original equation: \( f(f(0) + f(0)) = 0 + 0 = 0 \). So \( f(2a) = 0 \). But \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and since it&#x27;s injective, the only way \( f(2a) = 0 \) is if \( 2a \) is mapped uniquely. But if \( a = f(0) \), then \( a \) must be 0 because otherwise, \( 0 \) would be mapped to by \( 2a \), but \( a \) is already mapped to by 0, and since \( f \) is injective, \( 2a \) can&#x27;t also map to 0 unless \( 2a = a \), which would imply \( a = 0 \). Therefore, \( f(0) = 0 \).

Okay, so \( f(0) = 0 \). That&#x27;s a useful piece of information. Let&#x27;s note that down. So plugging \( m = 0 \) into the original equation gives us \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = 0 + n = n \). Since \( f(0) = 0 \), this simplifies to \( f(f(n)) = n \). Wait, so \( f \) is an involution, meaning that applying it twice gives the identity function. That is, \( f(f(n)) = n \) for all \( n \). That&#x27;s a key property.

So \( f \) is a bijective involution. Therefore, \( f \) is its own inverse. That&#x27;s a crucial observation. So if \( f(k) = l \), then \( f(l) = k \). This is because \( f(f(k)) = k \), so \( f(l) = k \). Therefore, the function pairs numbers in such a way that each pair \( (k, l) \) satisfies \( f(k) = l \) and \( f(l) = k \). However, if \( k = l \), then \( f(k) = k \), so fixed points are allowed. So \( f \) could be a permutation composed of transpositions (swaps of pairs) and fixed points.

But given that the function is strictly increasing (as we concluded earlier because decreasing would lead to contradictions in non-negative integers), then such transpositions would have to be arranged in a way that preserves the increasing order. But transpositions would require swapping elements, which might disrupt the increasing order. For example, if we swap 1 and 2, then \( f(1) = 2 \) and \( f(2) = 1 \), but then \( f(1) = 2 &gt; f(2) = 1 \), which contradicts the strictly increasing nature. Therefore, the only way for \( f \) to be a strictly increasing involution is if it is the identity function. Because any swap would violate the strictly increasing condition.

Therefore, if \( f \) is strictly increasing and an involution, then \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let me verify this. Suppose there exists some \( k \) such that \( f(k) \neq k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, either \( f(k) &gt; k \) or \( f(k) &lt; k \). Suppose \( f(k) = l &gt; k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \). But \( f(l) = k \) because \( f \) is an involution. However, \( k &lt; l \), so \( f(l) = k &lt; l \), but since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \geq f(k) + 1 = l + 1 \), which leads to a contradiction because \( k &lt; l \) and \( f(l) = k \geq l + 1 \) is impossible. Similarly, if \( f(k) = l &lt; k \), then \( f(l) = k \), but since \( l &lt; k \), \( f(l) = k &gt; l \), which again would require \( f(k) \geq f(l + 1) \geq f(l) + 1 = k + 1 \), which contradicts \( f(k) = l &lt; k \). Therefore, the only possibility is that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Therefore, the identity function is the only strictly increasing involution on \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \). Since our function \( f \) must be a strictly increasing bijection (as established earlier), and also an involution, the only solution is the identity function. Therefore, \( f(m) = m \) for all \( m \).

But let me just check again to make sure I haven&#x27;t missed any other possibilities. Suppose someone suggests another function, like \( f(m) = m + c \) for some constant \( c \). Let&#x27;s test this. Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + c + n + c) = (m + n + 2c) + c = m + n + 3c \). But this must equal \( m + n \), so \( 3c = 0 \), which implies \( c = 0 \). So that brings us back to the identity function.

Another thought: maybe a function that rearranges numbers in some way but still satisfies the condition. For example, suppose \( f(0) = 0 \), \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 1 \), and \( f(k) = k \) for \( k \geq 3 \). Let&#x27;s test this. Take \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \). Then \( f(f(1) + f(1)) = f(2 + 2) = f(4) = 4 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), so 4 ≠ 2. Therefore, this function doesn&#x27;t work. So swapping 1 and 2 causes a problem. Similarly, any swap would cause inconsistencies when the swapped numbers are used in the function&#x27;s arguments.

Alternatively, suppose we have a more complex permutation. But given the condition \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), it&#x27;s challenging to see how a non-identity permutation would satisfy this. For instance, let&#x27;s suppose that \( f(1) = a \), \( f(a) = 1 \). Then, taking \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(a + a) = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \). Then, applying \( f \) again, \( f(2) = 2a \). But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 0 \), we have \( f(2a + 0) = 2 + 0 = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \), which is consistent with the previous result. But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 2 \), we get \( f(2a + 2a) = f(4a) = 4 \). So \( f(4a) = 4 \), which implies \( f(4) = 4a \). Continuing this pattern, we see that if we set \( f(1) = a \), then \( f(2a) = 2 \), \( f(4a) = 4 \), etc. But since \( a \) must be a positive integer (as \( f \) maps to non-negative integers and is a bijection), if \( a &gt; 1 \), then \( 2a &gt; 2 \), so \( f(2a) = 2 \), but then \( f(2) = 2a \), which is greater than 2. But this would disrupt the strictly increasing nature of \( f \). For example, if \( a = 2 \), then \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 4 \), but then \( f(2) = 4 \) which is greater than \( f(3) \) must be 3 (if we follow the identity for other numbers). But that contradicts the strictly increasing requirement because 2 &lt; 3 but \( f(2) = 4 &gt; f(3) = 3 \). Hence, such a function cannot be increasing. Therefore, \( a \) must be 1, leading back to the identity function.

Another angle: suppose the function has some periodic behavior. For example, maybe even numbers are mapped to one sequence and odd numbers to another. But considering the bijectivity and the strictly increasing nature, it&#x27;s unclear how this could work without violating the functional equation. Let&#x27;s attempt a simple case. Suppose \( f(k) = k + 1 \) for even \( k \) and \( f(k) = k - 1 \) for odd \( k \). This swaps even and odd numbers. Let&#x27;s check \( f(f(m) + f(n)) \). Take \( m = 1 \) (odd), so \( f(1) = 0 \). \( n = 1 \), so \( f(1) = 0 \). Then \( f(0 + 0) = f(0) = 1 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), which is not equal to 1. So that doesn&#x27;t work. Another example: if \( f(k) = k + 2 \) for some \( k \), but then injectivity is lost unless it&#x27;s carefully constructed, which seems difficult.

Alternatively, maybe \( f(k) = c - k \) for some constant \( c \). But since the domain is non-negative integers, this would require \( c \geq k \) for all \( k \), which is impossible unless \( c \) is infinity, which isn&#x27;t a number. So that approach doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, but since \( f \) is an involution, another thought: if \( f \) is additive, meaning \( f(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \), but combined with the involution property. However, the given condition is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), which is different from additivity. If \( f \) were additive, then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(f(m)) + f(f(n)) = m + n \), which actually matches the given condition. So if \( f \) is additive and an involution, then it satisfies the equation. However, the only additive function on non-negative integers is linear, i.e., \( f(k) = ak \) for some constant \( a \). But given that \( f \) maps non-negative integers to non-negative integers and is bijective, \( a \) must be 1. Let&#x27;s verify:

Suppose \( f(k) = ak \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = a(a m + a n) = a^2(m + n) \). For this to equal \( m + n \), we need \( a^2 = 1 \), so \( a = 1 \), since \( a \) must be positive. Therefore, the only additive solution is the identity function. Therefore, even considering additive functions doesn&#x27;t give us any new solutions.

So far, all the lines of thought lead back to the identity function as the only solution. But to be thorough, let&#x27;s try to formally prove that \( f(m) = m \) is the only solution.

We already established that \( f \) is a bijection, strictly increasing, and an involution (i.e., \( f(f(k)) = k \) for all \( k \)). Let&#x27;s use induction to prove that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Base case: \( k = 0 \). We already showed \( f(0) = 0 \).

Inductive step: Assume that for all \( j &lt; k \), \( f(j) = j \). We need to show that \( f(k) = k \).

Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) &gt; f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Therefore, \( f(k) \geq k \) (because it has to be greater than all previous values, which are exactly 0, 1, ..., k-1). Suppose for contradiction that \( f(k) &gt; k \). Let \( f(k) = k + t \) where \( t \geq 1 \).

But since \( f \) is a bijection, there must be some \( m \) such that \( f(m) = k \). Because \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( m \) must be greater than or equal to \( k \) (since \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), so the pre-image of \( k \) must be less than \( k \), but wait, \( f \) is strictly increasing, so if \( f(m) = k \), then \( m \) must satisfy \( f(m) = k \). But since \( f \) is strictly increasing and \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), all values \( f(0), f(1), ..., f(k) \) are 0, 1, ..., k - 1, k + t. Therefore, the value \( k \) must be achieved by some \( m &lt; k \), but by the induction hypothesis, for \( m &lt; k \), \( f(m) = m \). Therefore, the only way \( f(m) = k \) is if \( m = k \), but this contradicts the induction hypothesis because \( m &lt; k \) would imply \( f(m) = m \neq k \). Therefore, there is a contradiction, meaning our assumption that \( f(k) &gt; k \) is false. Therefore, \( f(k) = k \).

Therefore, by induction, \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \).

Hence, the only function that satisfies the given condition is the identity function.

**Final Answer**
The only such function is the identity function, so the answer is \boxed{f(n) = n}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), we start by analyzing the given functional equation.

1. **Injectivity and Surjectivity**:
   - **Injectivity**: Suppose \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \) implies \( m + a = m + b \), so \( a = b \). Thus, \( f \) is injective.
   - **Surjectivity**: For any \( k \), setting \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \) gives \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k \). Let \( c = f(k) + f(0) \), then \( f(c) = k \). Thus, \( f \) is surjective.

2. **Bijectivity and Involution**:
   - Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it is bijective.
   - Setting \( m = 0 \) in the functional equation gives \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = n \). Knowing \( f(0) = 0 \) (from testing \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \)), we get \( f(f(n)) = n \). Thus, \( f \) is an involution.

3. **Strictly Increasing Nature**:
   - \( f \) must be strictly increasing. If not, there would be contradictions in the ordering of non-negative integers.

4. **Inductive Proof**:
   - **Base Case**: \( f(0) = 0 \).
   - **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) \geq k \). Suppose \( f(k) &gt; k \), then there must be some \( m &lt; k \) such that \( f(m) = k \), which contradicts the induction hypothesis. Hence, \( f(k) = k \).

Thus, the only function satisfying the given condition is the identity function. The final answer is \(\boxed{f(n) = n}\).          </p>

Okay, so injectivity is established. What about surjectivity? Let&#x27;s see. For any non-negative integer \( k \), we need to find some \( c \) such that \( f(c) = k \). Let&#x27;s pick an arbitrary \( k \). Suppose we set \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \). Then the equation becomes \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k + 0 = k \). Let&#x27;s denote \( c = f(k) + f(0) \). Then \( f(c) = k \). Therefore, for any \( k \), there exists such a \( c \), so \( f \) is surjective.

Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it&#x27;s bijective. That&#x27;s a good start. Bijections have well-defined inverse functions, but since we&#x27;re dealing with non-negative integers, the inverse might not necessarily be a function unless we&#x27;re careful. However, knowing that \( f \) is bijective can help us manipulate the equation.

Let me think. Since \( f \) is bijective, maybe we can express \( f(m) + f(n) \) in terms of the inverse function. Wait, but the equation given is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \). If I denote \( f(m) + f(n) \) as some input to \( f \), which outputs \( m + n \). If \( f \) is invertible, then \( f^{-1}(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \). But wait, inverses of functions on integers can be tricky because they might not exist unless the function is strictly increasing or decreasing. But since \( f \) is bijective, it must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing? Hmm, but in non-negative integers, strictly decreasing would eventually hit zero and negative numbers, which aren&#x27;t allowed. So \( f \) must be strictly increasing.

Therefore, \( f \) is a strictly increasing bijection. That&#x27;s helpful. So, for example, \( f(0) \) is the minimal value of \( f \), which must be 0 or some other number. Wait, but since \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and it&#x27;s a bijection, \( f(0) \) must be 0. Wait, let&#x27;s check that.

If \( f \) is a bijection from \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) to \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \), then it must map 0 to some number. Suppose \( f(0) = a \). Since it&#x27;s a bijection, \( a \) must be unique. Let&#x27;s plug \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \) into the original equation: \( f(f(0) + f(0)) = 0 + 0 = 0 \). So \( f(2a) = 0 \). But \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and since it&#x27;s injective, the only way \( f(2a) = 0 \) is if \( 2a \) is mapped uniquely. But if \( a = f(0) \), then \( a \) must be 0 because otherwise, \( 0 \) would be mapped to by \( 2a \), but \( a \) is already mapped to by 0, and since \( f \) is injective, \( 2a \) can&#x27;t also map to 0 unless \( 2a = a \), which would imply \( a = 0 \). Therefore, \( f(0) = 0 \).

Okay, so \( f(0) = 0 \). That&#x27;s a useful piece of information. Let&#x27;s note that down. So plugging \( m = 0 \) into the original equation gives us \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = 0 + n = n \). Since \( f(0) = 0 \), this simplifies to \( f(f(n)) = n \). Wait, so \( f \) is an involution, meaning that applying it twice gives the identity function. That is, \( f(f(n)) = n \) for all \( n \). That&#x27;s a key property.

So \( f \) is a bijective involution. Therefore, \( f \) is its own inverse. That&#x27;s a crucial observation. So if \( f(k) = l \), then \( f(l) = k \). This is because \( f(f(k)) = k \), so \( f(l) = k \). Therefore, the function pairs numbers in such a way that each pair \( (k, l) \) satisfies \( f(k) = l \) and \( f(l) = k \). However, if \( k = l \), then \( f(k) = k \), so fixed points are allowed. So \( f \) could be a permutation composed of transpositions (swaps of pairs) and fixed points.

But given that the function is strictly increasing (as we concluded earlier because decreasing would lead to contradictions in non-negative integers), then such transpositions would have to be arranged in a way that preserves the increasing order. But transpositions would require swapping elements, which might disrupt the increasing order. For example, if we swap 1 and 2, then \( f(1) = 2 \) and \( f(2) = 1 \), but then \( f(1) = 2 &gt; f(2) = 1 \), which contradicts the strictly increasing nature. Therefore, the only way for \( f \) to be a strictly increasing involution is if it is the identity function. Because any swap would violate the strictly increasing condition.

Therefore, if \( f \) is strictly increasing and an involution, then \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let me verify this. Suppose there exists some \( k \) such that \( f(k) \neq k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, either \( f(k) &gt; k \) or \( f(k) &lt; k \). Suppose \( f(k) = l &gt; k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \). But \( f(l) = k \) because \( f \) is an involution. However, \( k &lt; l \), so \( f(l) = k &lt; l \), but since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \geq f(k) + 1 = l + 1 \), which leads to a contradiction because \( k &lt; l \) and \( f(l) = k \geq l + 1 \) is impossible. Similarly, if \( f(k) = l &lt; k \), then \( f(l) = k \), but since \( l &lt; k \), \( f(l) = k &gt; l \), which again would require \( f(k) \geq f(l + 1) \geq f(l) + 1 = k + 1 \), which contradicts \( f(k) = l &lt; k \). Therefore, the only possibility is that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Therefore, the identity function is the only strictly increasing involution on \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \). Since our function \( f \) must be a strictly increasing bijection (as established earlier), and also an involution, the only solution is the identity function. Therefore, \( f(m) = m \) for all \( m \).

But let me just check again to make sure I haven&#x27;t missed any other possibilities. Suppose someone suggests another function, like \( f(m) = m + c \) for some constant \( c \). Let&#x27;s test this. Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + c + n + c) = (m + n + 2c) + c = m + n + 3c \). But this must equal \( m + n \), so \( 3c = 0 \), which implies \( c = 0 \). So that brings us back to the identity function.

Another thought: maybe a function that rearranges numbers in some way but still satisfies the condition. For example, suppose \( f(0) = 0 \), \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 1 \), and \( f(k) = k \) for \( k \geq 3 \). Let&#x27;s test this. Take \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \). Then \( f(f(1) + f(1)) = f(2 + 2) = f(4) = 4 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), so 4 ≠ 2. Therefore, this function doesn&#x27;t work. So swapping 1 and 2 causes a problem. Similarly, any swap would cause inconsistencies when the swapped numbers are used in the function&#x27;s arguments.

Alternatively, suppose we have a more complex permutation. But given the condition \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), it&#x27;s challenging to see how a non-identity permutation would satisfy this. For instance, let&#x27;s suppose that \( f(1) = a \), \( f(a) = 1 \). Then, taking \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(a + a) = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \). Then, applying \( f \) again, \( f(2) = 2a \). But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 0 \), we have \( f(2a + 0) = 2 + 0 = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \), which is consistent with the previous result. But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 2 \), we get \( f(2a + 2a) = f(4a) = 4 \). So \( f(4a) = 4 \), which implies \( f(4) = 4a \). Continuing this pattern, we see that if we set \( f(1) = a \), then \( f(2a) = 2 \), \( f(4a) = 4 \), etc. But since \( a \) must be a positive integer (as \( f \) maps to non-negative integers and is a bijection), if \( a &gt; 1 \), then \( 2a &gt; 2 \), so \( f(2a) = 2 \), but then \( f(2) = 2a \), which is greater than 2. But this would disrupt the strictly increasing nature of \( f \). For example, if \( a = 2 \), then \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 4 \), but then \( f(2) = 4 \) which is greater than \( f(3) \) must be 3 (if we follow the identity for other numbers). But that contradicts the strictly increasing requirement because 2 &lt; 3 but \( f(2) = 4 &gt; f(3) = 3 \). Hence, such a function cannot be increasing. Therefore, \( a \) must be 1, leading back to the identity function.

Another angle: suppose the function has some periodic behavior. For example, maybe even numbers are mapped to one sequence and odd numbers to another. But considering the bijectivity and the strictly increasing nature, it&#x27;s unclear how this could work without violating the functional equation. Let&#x27;s attempt a simple case. Suppose \( f(k) = k + 1 \) for even \( k \) and \( f(k) = k - 1 \) for odd \( k \). This swaps even and odd numbers. Let&#x27;s check \( f(f(m) + f(n)) \). Take \( m = 1 \) (odd), so \( f(1) = 0 \). \( n = 1 \), so \( f(1) = 0 \). Then \( f(0 + 0) = f(0) = 1 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), which is not equal to 1. So that doesn&#x27;t work. Another example: if \( f(k) = k + 2 \) for some \( k \), but then injectivity is lost unless it&#x27;s carefully constructed, which seems difficult.

Alternatively, maybe \( f(k) = c - k \) for some constant \( c \). But since the domain is non-negative integers, this would require \( c \geq k \) for all \( k \), which is impossible unless \( c \) is infinity, which isn&#x27;t a number. So that approach doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, but since \( f \) is an involution, another thought: if \( f \) is additive, meaning \( f(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \), but combined with the involution property. However, the given condition is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), which is different from additivity. If \( f \) were additive, then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(f(m)) + f(f(n)) = m + n \), which actually matches the given condition. So if \( f \) is additive and an involution, then it satisfies the equation. However, the only additive function on non-negative integers is linear, i.e., \( f(k) = ak \) for some constant \( a \). But given that \( f \) maps non-negative integers to non-negative integers and is bijective, \( a \) must be 1. Let&#x27;s verify:

Suppose \( f(k) = ak \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = a(a m + a n) = a^2(m + n) \). For this to equal \( m + n \), we need \( a^2 = 1 \), so \( a = 1 \), since \( a \) must be positive. Therefore, the only additive solution is the identity function. Therefore, even considering additive functions doesn&#x27;t give us any new solutions.

So far, all the lines of thought lead back to the identity function as the only solution. But to be thorough, let&#x27;s try to formally prove that \( f(m) = m \) is the only solution.

We already established that \( f \) is a bijection, strictly increasing, and an involution (i.e., \( f(f(k)) = k \) for all \( k \)). Let&#x27;s use induction to prove that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Base case: \( k = 0 \). We already showed \( f(0) = 0 \).

Inductive step: Assume that for all \( j &lt; k \), \( f(j) = j \). We need to show that \( f(k) = k \).

Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) &gt; f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Therefore, \( f(k) \geq k \) (because it has to be greater than all previous values, which are exactly 0, 1, ..., k-1). Suppose for contradiction that \( f(k) &gt; k \). Let \( f(k) = k + t \) where \( t \geq 1 \).

But since \( f \) is a bijection, there must be some \( m \) such that \( f(m) = k \). Because \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( m \) must be greater than or equal to \( k \) (since \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), so the pre-image of \( k \) must be less than \( k \), but wait, \( f \) is strictly increasing, so if \( f(m) = k \), then \( m \) must satisfy \( f(m) = k \). But since \( f \) is strictly increasing and \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), all values \( f(0), f(1), ..., f(k) \) are 0, 1, ..., k - 1, k + t. Therefore, the value \( k \) must be achieved by some \( m &lt; k \), but by the induction hypothesis, for \( m &lt; k \), \( f(m) = m \). Therefore, the only way \( f(m) = k \) is if \( m = k \), but this contradicts the induction hypothesis because \( m &lt; k \) would imply \( f(m) = m \neq k \). Therefore, there is a contradiction, meaning our assumption that \( f(k) &gt; k \) is false. Therefore, \( f(k) = k \).

Therefore, by induction, \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \).

Hence, the only function that satisfies the given condition is the identity function.

**Final Answer**
The only such function is the identity function, so the answer is \boxed{f(n) = n}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), we start by analyzing the given functional equation.

1. **Injectivity and Surjectivity**:
   - **Injectivity**: Suppose \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \) implies \( m + a = m + b \), so \( a = b \). Thus, \( f \) is injective.
   - **Surjectivity**: For any \( k \), setting \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \) gives \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k \). Let \( c = f(k) + f(0) \), then \( f(c) = k \). Thus, \( f \) is surjective.

2. **Bijectivity and Involution**:
   - Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it is bijective.
   - Setting \( m = 0 \) in the functional equation gives \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = n \). Knowing \( f(0) = 0 \) (from testing \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \)), we get \( f(f(n)) = n \). Thus, \( f \) is an involution.

3. **Strictly Increasing Nature**:
   - \( f \) must be strictly increasing. If not, there would be contradictions in the ordering of non-negative integers.

4. **Inductive Proof**:
   - **Base Case**: \( f(0) = 0 \).
   - **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) \geq k \). Suppose \( f(k) &gt; k \), then there must be some \( m &lt; k \) such that \( f(m) = k \), which contradicts the induction hypothesis. Hence, \( f(k) = k \).

Thus, the only function satisfying the given condition is the identity function. The final answer is \(\boxed{f(n) = n}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), the equation \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) holds. Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall that \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) means the set of all non-negative integers, which includes 0, 1, 2, and so on. So the function \( f \) takes non-negative integers and maps them to non-negative integers. The condition given is that if I take two numbers \( m \) and \( n \), apply \( f \) to each of them, add the results together, and then apply \( f \) again, I should get \( m + n \). Interesting. So \( f \) composed with addition somehow inverts the process?

Maybe I should start by checking if there are any simple functions that satisfy this. The first one that comes to mind is the identity function, where \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let&#x27;s test that:

If \( f(k) = k \), then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + n) = m + n \), which matches the given condition. So the identity function works. But the problem says &quot;find all functions,&quot; so there might be others, or maybe the identity is the only solution.

But before jumping to conclusions, let&#x27;s see if there are other possibilities. Sometimes functions can be involutions, meaning that applying them twice gives the identity. But in this case, the functional equation isn&#x27;t exactly an involution; it&#x27;s more like a nested function. Let&#x27;s try to analyze the properties that such a function \( f \) must have.

First, is \( f \) injective? Suppose that \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then, for any \( m \), consider \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \). By the given equation, this implies \( m + a = m + b \), which would mean \( a = b \). Therefore, \( f \) is injective.

Okay, so injectivity is established. What about surjectivity? Let&#x27;s see. For any non-negative integer \( k \), we need to find some \( c \) such that \( f(c) = k \). Let&#x27;s pick an arbitrary \( k \). Suppose we set \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \). Then the equation becomes \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k + 0 = k \). Let&#x27;s denote \( c = f(k) + f(0) \). Then \( f(c) = k \). Therefore, for any \( k \), there exists such a \( c \), so \( f \) is surjective.

Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it&#x27;s bijective. That&#x27;s a good start. Bijections have well-defined inverse functions, but since we&#x27;re dealing with non-negative integers, the inverse might not necessarily be a function unless we&#x27;re careful. However, knowing that \( f \) is bijective can help us manipulate the equation.

Let me think. Since \( f \) is bijective, maybe we can express \( f(m) + f(n) \) in terms of the inverse function. Wait, but the equation given is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \). If I denote \( f(m) + f(n) \) as some input to \( f \), which outputs \( m + n \). If \( f \) is invertible, then \( f^{-1}(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \). But wait, inverses of functions on integers can be tricky because they might not exist unless the function is strictly increasing or decreasing. But since \( f \) is bijective, it must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing? Hmm, but in non-negative integers, strictly decreasing would eventually hit zero and negative numbers, which aren&#x27;t allowed. So \( f \) must be strictly increasing.

Therefore, \( f \) is a strictly increasing bijection. That&#x27;s helpful. So, for example, \( f(0) \) is the minimal value of \( f \), which must be 0 or some other number. Wait, but since \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and it&#x27;s a bijection, \( f(0) \) must be 0. Wait, let&#x27;s check that.

If \( f \) is a bijection from \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) to \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \), then it must map 0 to some number. Suppose \( f(0) = a \). Since it&#x27;s a bijection, \( a \) must be unique. Let&#x27;s plug \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \) into the original equation: \( f(f(0) + f(0)) = 0 + 0 = 0 \). So \( f(2a) = 0 \). But \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and since it&#x27;s injective, the only way \( f(2a) = 0 \) is if \( 2a \) is mapped uniquely. But if \( a = f(0) \), then \( a \) must be 0 because otherwise, \( 0 \) would be mapped to by \( 2a \), but \( a \) is already mapped to by 0, and since \( f \) is injective, \( 2a \) can&#x27;t also map to 0 unless \( 2a = a \), which would imply \( a = 0 \). Therefore, \( f(0) = 0 \).

Okay, so \( f(0) = 0 \). That&#x27;s a useful piece of information. Let&#x27;s note that down. So plugging \( m = 0 \) into the original equation gives us \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = 0 + n = n \). Since \( f(0) = 0 \), this simplifies to \( f(f(n)) = n \). Wait, so \( f \) is an involution, meaning that applying it twice gives the identity function. That is, \( f(f(n)) = n \) for all \( n \). That&#x27;s a key property.

So \( f \) is a bijective involution. Therefore, \( f \) is its own inverse. That&#x27;s a crucial observation. So if \( f(k) = l \), then \( f(l) = k \). This is because \( f(f(k)) = k \), so \( f(l) = k \). Therefore, the function pairs numbers in such a way that each pair \( (k, l) \) satisfies \( f(k) = l \) and \( f(l) = k \). However, if \( k = l \), then \( f(k) = k \), so fixed points are allowed. So \( f \) could be a permutation composed of transpositions (swaps of pairs) and fixed points.

But given that the function is strictly increasing (as we concluded earlier because decreasing would lead to contradictions in non-negative integers), then such transpositions would have to be arranged in a way that preserves the increasing order. But transpositions would require swapping elements, which might disrupt the increasing order. For example, if we swap 1 and 2, then \( f(1) = 2 \) and \( f(2) = 1 \), but then \( f(1) = 2 &gt; f(2) = 1 \), which contradicts the strictly increasing nature. Therefore, the only way for \( f \) to be a strictly increasing involution is if it is the identity function. Because any swap would violate the strictly increasing condition.

Therefore, if \( f \) is strictly increasing and an involution, then \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let me verify this. Suppose there exists some \( k \) such that \( f(k) \neq k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, either \( f(k) &gt; k \) or \( f(k) &lt; k \). Suppose \( f(k) = l &gt; k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \). But \( f(l) = k \) because \( f \) is an involution. However, \( k &lt; l \), so \( f(l) = k &lt; l \), but since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \geq f(k) + 1 = l + 1 \), which leads to a contradiction because \( k &lt; l \) and \( f(l) = k \geq l + 1 \) is impossible. Similarly, if \( f(k) = l &lt; k \), then \( f(l) = k \), but since \( l &lt; k \), \( f(l) = k &gt; l \), which again would require \( f(k) \geq f(l + 1) \geq f(l) + 1 = k + 1 \), which contradicts \( f(k) = l &lt; k \). Therefore, the only possibility is that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Therefore, the identity function is the only strictly increasing involution on \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \). Since our function \( f \) must be a strictly increasing bijection (as established earlier), and also an involution, the only solution is the identity function. Therefore, \( f(m) = m \) for all \( m \).

But let me just check again to make sure I haven&#x27;t missed any other possibilities. Suppose someone suggests another function, like \( f(m) = m + c \) for some constant \( c \). Let&#x27;s test this. Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + c + n + c) = (m + n + 2c) + c = m + n + 3c \). But this must equal \( m + n \), so \( 3c = 0 \), which implies \( c = 0 \). So that brings us back to the identity function.

Another thought: maybe a function that rearranges numbers in some way but still satisfies the condition. For example, suppose \( f(0) = 0 \), \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 1 \), and \( f(k) = k \) for \( k \geq 3 \). Let&#x27;s test this. Take \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \). Then \( f(f(1) + f(1)) = f(2 + 2) = f(4) = 4 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), so 4 ≠ 2. Therefore, this function doesn&#x27;t work. So swapping 1 and 2 causes a problem. Similarly, any swap would cause inconsistencies when the swapped numbers are used in the function&#x27;s arguments.

Alternatively, suppose we have a more complex permutation. But given the condition \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), it&#x27;s challenging to see how a non-identity permutation would satisfy this. For instance, let&#x27;s suppose that \( f(1) = a \), \( f(a) = 1 \). Then, taking \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(a + a) = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \). Then, applying \( f \) again, \( f(2) = 2a \). But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 0 \), we have \( f(2a + 0) = 2 + 0 = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \), which is consistent with the previous result. But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 2 \), we get \( f(2a + 2a) = f(4a) = 4 \). So \( f(4a) = 4 \), which implies \( f(4) = 4a \). Continuing this pattern, we see that if we set \( f(1) = a \), then \( f(2a) = 2 \), \( f(4a) = 4 \), etc. But since \( a \) must be a positive integer (as \( f \) maps to non-negative integers and is a bijection), if \( a &gt; 1 \), then \( 2a &gt; 2 \), so \( f(2a) = 2 \), but then \( f(2) = 2a \), which is greater than 2. But this would disrupt the strictly increasing nature of \( f \). For example, if \( a = 2 \), then \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 4 \), but then \( f(2) = 4 \) which is greater than \( f(3) \) must be 3 (if we follow the identity for other numbers). But that contradicts the strictly increasing requirement because 2 &lt; 3 but \( f(2) = 4 &gt; f(3) = 3 \). Hence, such a function cannot be increasing. Therefore, \( a \) must be 1, leading back to the identity function.

Another angle: suppose the function has some periodic behavior. For example, maybe even numbers are mapped to one sequence and odd numbers to another. But considering the bijectivity and the strictly increasing nature, it&#x27;s unclear how this could work without violating the functional equation. Let&#x27;s attempt a simple case. Suppose \( f(k) = k + 1 \) for even \( k \) and \( f(k) = k - 1 \) for odd \( k \). This swaps even and odd numbers. Let&#x27;s check \( f(f(m) + f(n)) \). Take \( m = 1 \) (odd), so \( f(1) = 0 \). \( n = 1 \), so \( f(1) = 0 \). Then \( f(0 + 0) = f(0) = 1 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), which is not equal to 1. So that doesn&#x27;t work. Another example: if \( f(k) = k + 2 \) for some \( k \), but then injectivity is lost unless it&#x27;s carefully constructed, which seems difficult.

Alternatively, maybe \( f(k) = c - k \) for some constant \( c \). But since the domain is non-negative integers, this would require \( c \geq k \) for all \( k \), which is impossible unless \( c \) is infinity, which isn&#x27;t a number. So that approach doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, but since \( f \) is an involution, another thought: if \( f \) is additive, meaning \( f(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \), but combined with the involution property. However, the given condition is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), which is different from additivity. If \( f \) were additive, then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(f(m)) + f(f(n)) = m + n \), which actually matches the given condition. So if \( f \) is additive and an involution, then it satisfies the equation. However, the only additive function on non-negative integers is linear, i.e., \( f(k) = ak \) for some constant \( a \). But given that \( f \) maps non-negative integers to non-negative integers and is bijective, \( a \) must be 1. Let&#x27;s verify:

Suppose \( f(k) = ak \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = a(a m + a n) = a^2(m + n) \). For this to equal \( m + n \), we need \( a^2 = 1 \), so \( a = 1 \), since \( a \) must be positive. Therefore, the only additive solution is the identity function. Therefore, even considering additive functions doesn&#x27;t give us any new solutions.

So far, all the lines of thought lead back to the identity function as the only solution. But to be thorough, let&#x27;s try to formally prove that \( f(m) = m \) is the only solution.

We already established that \( f \) is a bijection, strictly increasing, and an involution (i.e., \( f(f(k)) = k \) for all \( k \)). Let&#x27;s use induction to prove that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Base case: \( k = 0 \). We already showed \( f(0) = 0 \).

Inductive step: Assume that for all \( j &lt; k \), \( f(j) = j \). We need to show that \( f(k) = k \).

Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) &gt; f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Therefore, \( f(k) \geq k \) (because it has to be greater than all previous values, which are exactly 0, 1, ..., k-1). Suppose for contradiction that \( f(k) &gt; k \). Let \( f(k) = k + t \) where \( t \geq 1 \).

But since \( f \) is a bijection, there must be some \( m \) such that \( f(m) = k \). Because \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( m \) must be greater than or equal to \( k \) (since \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), so the pre-image of \( k \) must be less than \( k \), but wait, \( f \) is strictly increasing, so if \( f(m) = k \), then \( m \) must satisfy \( f(m) = k \). But since \( f \) is strictly increasing and \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), all values \( f(0), f(1), ..., f(k) \) are 0, 1, ..., k - 1, k + t. Therefore, the value \( k \) must be achieved by some \( m &lt; k \), but by the induction hypothesis, for \( m &lt; k \), \( f(m) = m \). Therefore, the only way \( f(m) = k \) is if \( m = k \), but this contradicts the induction hypothesis because \( m &lt; k \) would imply \( f(m) = m \neq k \). Therefore, there is a contradiction, meaning our assumption that \( f(k) &gt; k \) is false. Therefore, \( f(k) = k \).

Therefore, by induction, \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \).

Hence, the only function that satisfies the given condition is the identity function.

**Final Answer**
The only such function is the identity function, so the answer is \boxed{f(n) = n}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), we start by analyzing the given functional equation.

1. **Injectivity and Surjectivity**:
   - **Injectivity**: Suppose \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \) implies \( m + a = m + b \), so \( a = b \). Thus, \( f \) is injective.
   - **Surjectivity**: For any \( k \), setting \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \) gives \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k \). Let \( c = f(k) + f(0) \), then \( f(c) = k \). Thus, \( f \) is surjective.

2. **Bijectivity and Involution**:
   - Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it is bijective.
   - Setting \( m = 0 \) in the functional equation gives \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = n \). Knowing \( f(0) = 0 \) (from testing \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \)), we get \( f(f(n)) = n \). Thus, \( f \) is an involution.

3. **Strictly Increasing Nature**:
   - \( f \) must be strictly increasing. If not, there would be contradictions in the ordering of non-negative integers.

4. **Inductive Proof**:
   - **Base Case**: \( f(0) = 0 \).
   - **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) \geq k \). Suppose \( f(k) &gt; k \), then there must be some \( m &lt; k \) such that \( f(m) = k \), which contradicts the induction hypothesis. Hence, \( f(k) = k \).

Thus, the only function satisfying the given condition is the identity function. The final answer is \(\boxed{f(n) = n}\).          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), the equation \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) holds. Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall that \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) means the set of all non-negative integers, which includes 0, 1, 2, and so on. So the function \( f \) takes non-negative integers and maps them to non-negative integers. The condition given is that if I take two numbers \( m \) and \( n \), apply \( f \) to each of them, add the results together, and then apply \( f \) again, I should get \( m + n \). Interesting. So \( f \) composed with addition somehow inverts the process?

Maybe I should start by checking if there are any simple functions that satisfy this. The first one that comes to mind is the identity function, where \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let&#x27;s test that:

If \( f(k) = k \), then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + n) = m + n \), which matches the given condition. So the identity function works. But the problem says &quot;find all functions,&quot; so there might be others, or maybe the identity is the only solution.

But before jumping to conclusions, let&#x27;s see if there are other possibilities. Sometimes functions can be involutions, meaning that applying them twice gives the identity. But in this case, the functional equation isn&#x27;t exactly an involution; it&#x27;s more like a nested function. Let&#x27;s try to analyze the properties that such a function \( f \) must have.

First, is \( f \) injective? Suppose that \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then, for any \( m \), consider \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \). By the given equation, this implies \( m + a = m + b \), which would mean \( a = b \). Therefore, \( f \) is injective.

Okay, so injectivity is established. What about surjectivity? Let&#x27;s see. For any non-negative integer \( k \), we need to find some \( c \) such that \( f(c) = k \). Let&#x27;s pick an arbitrary \( k \). Suppose we set \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \). Then the equation becomes \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k + 0 = k \). Let&#x27;s denote \( c = f(k) + f(0) \). Then \( f(c) = k \). Therefore, for any \( k \), there exists such a \( c \), so \( f \) is surjective.

Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it&#x27;s bijective. That&#x27;s a good start. Bijections have well-defined inverse functions, but since we&#x27;re dealing with non-negative integers, the inverse might not necessarily be a function unless we&#x27;re careful. However, knowing that \( f \) is bijective can help us manipulate the equation.

Let me think. Since \( f \) is bijective, maybe we can express \( f(m) + f(n) \) in terms of the inverse function. Wait, but the equation given is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \). If I denote \( f(m) + f(n) \) as some input to \( f \), which outputs \( m + n \). If \( f \) is invertible, then \( f^{-1}(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \). But wait, inverses of functions on integers can be tricky because they might not exist unless the function is strictly increasing or decreasing. But since \( f \) is bijective, it must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing? Hmm, but in non-negative integers, strictly decreasing would eventually hit zero and negative numbers, which aren&#x27;t allowed. So \( f \) must be strictly increasing.

Therefore, \( f \) is a strictly increasing bijection. That&#x27;s helpful. So, for example, \( f(0) \) is the minimal value of \( f \), which must be 0 or some other number. Wait, but since \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and it&#x27;s a bijection, \( f(0) \) must be 0. Wait, let&#x27;s check that.

If \( f \) is a bijection from \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) to \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \), then it must map 0 to some number. Suppose \( f(0) = a \). Since it&#x27;s a bijection, \( a \) must be unique. Let&#x27;s plug \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \) into the original equation: \( f(f(0) + f(0)) = 0 + 0 = 0 \). So \( f(2a) = 0 \). But \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and since it&#x27;s injective, the only way \( f(2a) = 0 \) is if \( 2a \) is mapped uniquely. But if \( a = f(0) \), then \( a \) must be 0 because otherwise, \( 0 \) would be mapped to by \( 2a \), but \( a \) is already mapped to by 0, and since \( f \) is injective, \( 2a \) can&#x27;t also map to 0 unless \( 2a = a \), which would imply \( a = 0 \). Therefore, \( f(0) = 0 \).

Okay, so \( f(0) = 0 \). That&#x27;s a useful piece of information. Let&#x27;s note that down. So plugging \( m = 0 \) into the original equation gives us \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = 0 + n = n \). Since \( f(0) = 0 \), this simplifies to \( f(f(n)) = n \). Wait, so \( f \) is an involution, meaning that applying it twice gives the identity function. That is, \( f(f(n)) = n \) for all \( n \). That&#x27;s a key property.

So \( f \) is a bijective involution. Therefore, \( f \) is its own inverse. That&#x27;s a crucial observation. So if \( f(k) = l \), then \( f(l) = k \). This is because \( f(f(k)) = k \), so \( f(l) = k \). Therefore, the function pairs numbers in such a way that each pair \( (k, l) \) satisfies \( f(k) = l \) and \( f(l) = k \). However, if \( k = l \), then \( f(k) = k \), so fixed points are allowed. So \( f \) could be a permutation composed of transpositions (swaps of pairs) and fixed points.

But given that the function is strictly increasing (as we concluded earlier because decreasing would lead to contradictions in non-negative integers), then such transpositions would have to be arranged in a way that preserves the increasing order. But transpositions would require swapping elements, which might disrupt the increasing order. For example, if we swap 1 and 2, then \( f(1) = 2 \) and \( f(2) = 1 \), but then \( f(1) = 2 &gt; f(2) = 1 \), which contradicts the strictly increasing nature. Therefore, the only way for \( f \) to be a strictly increasing involution is if it is the identity function. Because any swap would violate the strictly increasing condition.

Therefore, if \( f \) is strictly increasing and an involution, then \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let me verify this. Suppose there exists some \( k \) such that \( f(k) \neq k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, either \( f(k) &gt; k \) or \( f(k) &lt; k \). Suppose \( f(k) = l &gt; k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \). But \( f(l) = k \) because \( f \) is an involution. However, \( k &lt; l \), so \( f(l) = k &lt; l \), but since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \geq f(k) + 1 = l + 1 \), which leads to a contradiction because \( k &lt; l \) and \( f(l) = k \geq l + 1 \) is impossible. Similarly, if \( f(k) = l &lt; k \), then \( f(l) = k \), but since \( l &lt; k \), \( f(l) = k &gt; l \), which again would require \( f(k) \geq f(l + 1) \geq f(l) + 1 = k + 1 \), which contradicts \( f(k) = l &lt; k \). Therefore, the only possibility is that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Therefore, the identity function is the only strictly increasing involution on \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \). Since our function \( f \) must be a strictly increasing bijection (as established earlier), and also an involution, the only solution is the identity function. Therefore, \( f(m) = m \) for all \( m \).

But let me just check again to make sure I haven&#x27;t missed any other possibilities. Suppose someone suggests another function, like \( f(m) = m + c \) for some constant \( c \). Let&#x27;s test this. Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + c + n + c) = (m + n + 2c) + c = m + n + 3c \). But this must equal \( m + n \), so \( 3c = 0 \), which implies \( c = 0 \). So that brings us back to the identity function.

Another thought: maybe a function that rearranges numbers in some way but still satisfies the condition. For example, suppose \( f(0) = 0 \), \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 1 \), and \( f(k) = k \) for \( k \geq 3 \). Let&#x27;s test this. Take \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \). Then \( f(f(1) + f(1)) = f(2 + 2) = f(4) = 4 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), so 4 ≠ 2. Therefore, this function doesn&#x27;t work. So swapping 1 and 2 causes a problem. Similarly, any swap would cause inconsistencies when the swapped numbers are used in the function&#x27;s arguments.

Alternatively, suppose we have a more complex permutation. But given the condition \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), it&#x27;s challenging to see how a non-identity permutation would satisfy this. For instance, let&#x27;s suppose that \( f(1) = a \), \( f(a) = 1 \). Then, taking \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(a + a) = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \). Then, applying \( f \) again, \( f(2) = 2a \). But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 0 \), we have \( f(2a + 0) = 2 + 0 = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \), which is consistent with the previous result. But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 2 \), we get \( f(2a + 2a) = f(4a) = 4 \). So \( f(4a) = 4 \), which implies \( f(4) = 4a \). Continuing this pattern, we see that if we set \( f(1) = a \), then \( f(2a) = 2 \), \( f(4a) = 4 \), etc. But since \( a \) must be a positive integer (as \( f \) maps to non-negative integers and is a bijection), if \( a &gt; 1 \), then \( 2a &gt; 2 \), so \( f(2a) = 2 \), but then \( f(2) = 2a \), which is greater than 2. But this would disrupt the strictly increasing nature of \( f \). For example, if \( a = 2 \), then \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 4 \), but then \( f(2) = 4 \) which is greater than \( f(3) \) must be 3 (if we follow the identity for other numbers). But that contradicts the strictly increasing requirement because 2 &lt; 3 but \( f(2) = 4 &gt; f(3) = 3 \). Hence, such a function cannot be increasing. Therefore, \( a \) must be 1, leading back to the identity function.

Another angle: suppose the function has some periodic behavior. For example, maybe even numbers are mapped to one sequence and odd numbers to another. But considering the bijectivity and the strictly increasing nature, it&#x27;s unclear how this could work without violating the functional equation. Let&#x27;s attempt a simple case. Suppose \( f(k) = k + 1 \) for even \( k \) and \( f(k) = k - 1 \) for odd \( k \). This swaps even and odd numbers. Let&#x27;s check \( f(f(m) + f(n)) \). Take \( m = 1 \) (odd), so \( f(1) = 0 \). \( n = 1 \), so \( f(1) = 0 \). Then \( f(0 + 0) = f(0) = 1 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), which is not equal to 1. So that doesn&#x27;t work. Another example: if \( f(k) = k + 2 \) for some \( k \), but then injectivity is lost unless it&#x27;s carefully constructed, which seems difficult.

Wait, but since \( f \) is an involution, another thought: if \( f \) is additive, meaning \( f(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \), but combined with the involution property. However, the given condition is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), which is different from additivity. If \( f \) were additive, then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(f(m)) + f(f(n)) = m + n \), which actually matches the given condition. So if \( f \) is additive and an involution, then it satisfies the equation. However, the only additive function on non-negative integers is linear, i.e., \( f(k) = ak \) for some constant \( a \). But given that \( f \) maps non-negative integers to non-negative integers and is bijective, \( a \) must be 1. Let&#x27;s verify:

Suppose \( f(k) = ak \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = a(a m + a n) = a^2(m + n) \). For this to equal \( m + n \), we need \( a^2 = 1 \), so \( a = 1 \), since \( a \) must be positive. Therefore, the only additive solution is the identity function. Therefore, even considering additive functions doesn&#x27;t give us any new solutions.

So far, all the lines of thought lead back to the identity function as the only solution. But to be thorough, let&#x27;s try to formally prove that \( f(m) = m \) is the only solution.

We already established that \( f \) is a bijection, strictly increasing, and an involution (i.e., \( f(f(k)) = k \) for all \( k \)). Let&#x27;s use induction to prove that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Base case: \( k = 0 \). We already showed \( f(0) = 0 \).

Inductive step: Assume that for all \( j &lt; k \), \( f(j) = j \). We need to show that \( f(k) = k \).

Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) &gt; f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Therefore, \( f(k) \geq k \) (because it has to be greater than all previous values, which are exactly 0, 1, ..., k-1). Suppose for contradiction that \( f(k) &gt; k \). Let \( f(k) = k + t \) where \( t \geq 1 \).

But since \( f \) is a bijection, there must be some \( m \) such that \( f(m) = k \). Because \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( m \) must be greater than or equal to \( k \) (since \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), so the pre-image of \( k \) must be less than \( k \), but wait, \( f \) is strictly increasing, so if \( f(m) = k \), then \( m \) must satisfy \( f(m) = k \). But since \( f \) is strictly increasing and \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), all values \( f(0), f(1), ..., f(k) \) are 0, 1, ..., k - 1, k + t. Therefore, the value \( k \) must be achieved by some \( m &lt; k \), but by the induction hypothesis, for \( m &lt; k \), \( f(m) = m \). Therefore, the only way \( f(m) = k \) is if \( m = k \), but this contradicts the induction hypothesis because \( m &lt; k \) would imply \( f(m) = m \neq k \). Therefore, there is a contradiction, meaning our assumption that \( f(k) &gt; k \) is false. Therefore, \( f(k) = k \).

Therefore, by induction, \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \).

Hence, the only function that satisfies the given condition is the identity function.

**Final Answer**
The only such function is the identity function, so the answer is \boxed{f(n) = n}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), we start by analyzing the given functional equation.

1. **Injectivity and Surjectivity**:
   - **Injectivity**: Suppose \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \) implies \( m + a = m + b \), so \( a = b \). Thus, \( f \) is injective.
   - **Surjectivity**: For any \( k \), setting \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \) gives \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k \). Let \( c = f(k) + f(0) \), then \( f(c) = k \). Thus, \( f \) is surjective.

2. **Bijectivity and Involution**:
   - Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it is bijective.
   - Setting \( m = 0 \) in the functional equation gives \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = n \). Knowing \( f(0) = 0 \) (from testing \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \)), we get \( f(f(n)) = n \). Thus, \( f \) is an involution.

3. **Strictly Increasing Nature**:
   - \( f \) must be strictly increasing. If not, there would be contradictions in the ordering of non-negative integers.

4. **Inductive Proof**:
   - **Base Case**: \( f(0) = 0 \).
   - **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) \geq k \). Suppose \( f(k) &gt; k \), then there must be some \( m &lt; k \) such that \( f(m) = k \), which contradicts the induction hypothesis. Hence, \( f(k) = k \).

Thus, the only function satisfying the given condition is the identity function. The final answer is \(\boxed{f(n) = n}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), the equation \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) holds. Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall that \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) means the set of all non-negative integers, which includes 0, 1, 2, and so on. So the function \( f \) takes non-negative integers and maps them to non-negative integers. The condition given is that if I take two numbers \( m \) and \( n \), apply \( f \) to each of them, add the results together, and then apply \( f \) again, I should get \( m + n \). Interesting. So \( f \) composed with addition somehow inverts the process?

Maybe I should start by checking if there are any simple functions that satisfy this. The first one that comes to mind is the identity function, where \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let&#x27;s test that:

If \( f(k) = k \), then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + n) = m + n \), which matches the given condition. So the identity function works. But the problem says &quot;find all functions,&quot; so there might be others, or maybe the identity is the only solution.

But before jumping to conclusions, let&#x27;s see if there are other possibilities. Sometimes functions can be involutions, meaning that applying them twice gives the identity. But in this case, the functional equation isn&#x27;t exactly an involution; it&#x27;s more like a nested function. Let&#x27;s try to analyze the properties that such a function \( f \) must have.

First, is \( f \) injective? Suppose that \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then, for any \( m \), consider \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \). By the given equation, this implies \( m + a = m + b \), which would mean \( a = b \). Therefore, \( f \) is injective.

Okay, so injectivity is established. What about surjectivity? Let&#x27;s see. For any non-negative integer \( k \), we need to find some \( c \) such that \( f(c) = k \). Let&#x27;s pick an arbitrary \( k \). Suppose we set \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \). Then the equation becomes \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k + 0 = k \). Let&#x27;s denote \( c = f(k) + f(0) \). Then \( f(c) = k \). Therefore, for any \( k \), there exists such a \( c \), so \( f \) is surjective.

Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it&#x27;s bijective. That&#x27;s a good start. Bijections have well-defined inverse functions, but since we&#x27;re dealing with non-negative integers, the inverse might not necessarily be a function unless we&#x27;re careful. However, knowing that \( f \) is bijective can help us manipulate the equation.

Let me think. Since \( f \) is bijective, maybe we can express \( f(m) + f(n) \) in terms of the inverse function. Wait, but the equation given is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \). If I denote \( f(m) + f(n) \) as some input to \( f \), which outputs \( m + n \). If \( f \) is invertible, then \( f^{-1}(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \). But wait, inverses of functions on integers can be tricky because they might not exist unless the function is strictly increasing or decreasing. But since \( f \) is bijective, it must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing? Hmm, but in non-negative integers, strictly decreasing would eventually hit zero and negative numbers, which aren&#x27;t allowed. So \( f \) must be strictly increasing.

Therefore, \( f \) is a strictly increasing bijection. That&#x27;s helpful. So, for example, \( f(0) \) is the minimal value of \( f \), which must be 0 or some other number. Wait, but since \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and it&#x27;s a bijection, \( f(0) \) must be 0. Wait, let&#x27;s check that.

If \( f \) is a bijection from \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) to \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \), then it must map 0 to some number. Suppose \( f(0) = a \). Since it&#x27;s a bijection, \( a \) must be unique. Let&#x27;s plug \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \) into the original equation: \( f(f(0) + f(0)) = 0 + 0 = 0 \). So \( f(2a) = 0 \). But \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and since it&#x27;s injective, the only way \( f(2a) = 0 \) is if \( 2a \) is mapped uniquely. But if \( a = f(0) \), then \( a \) must be 0 because otherwise, \( 0 \) would be mapped to by \( 2a \), but \( a \) is already mapped to by 0, and since \( f \) is injective, \( 2a \) can&#x27;t also map to 0 unless \( 2a = a \), which would imply \( a = 0 \). Therefore, \( f(0) = 0 \).

Okay, so \( f(0) = 0 \). That&#x27;s a useful piece of information. Let&#x27;s note that down. So plugging \( m = 0 \) into the original equation gives us \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = 0 + n = n \). Since \( f(0) = 0 \), this simplifies to \( f(f(n)) = n \). Wait, so \( f \) is an involution, meaning that applying it twice gives the identity function. That is, \( f(f(n)) = n \) for all \( n \). That&#x27;s a key property.

So \( f \) is a bijective involution. Therefore, \( f \) is its own inverse. That&#x27;s a crucial observation. So if \( f(k) = l \), then \( f(l) = k \). This is because \( f(f(k)) = k \), so \( f(l) = k \). Therefore, the function pairs numbers in such a way that each pair \( (k, l) \) satisfies \( f(k) = l \) and \( f(l) = k \). However, if \( k = l \), then \( f(k) = k \), so fixed points are allowed. So \( f \) could be a permutation composed of transpositions (swaps of pairs) and fixed points.

But given that the function is strictly increasing (as we concluded earlier because decreasing would lead to contradictions in non-negative integers), then such transpositions would have to be arranged in a way that preserves the increasing order. But transpositions would require swapping elements, which might disrupt the increasing order. For example, if we swap 1 and 2, then \( f(1) = 2 \) and \( f(2) = 1 \), but then \( f(1) = 2 &gt; f(2) = 1 \), which contradicts the strictly increasing nature. Therefore, the only way for \( f \) to be a strictly increasing involution is if it is the identity function. Because any swap would violate the strictly increasing condition.

Therefore, if \( f \) is strictly increasing and an involution, then \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let me verify this. Suppose there exists some \( k \) such that \( f(k) \neq k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, either \( f(k) &gt; k \) or \( f(k) &lt; k \). Suppose \( f(k) = l &gt; k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \). But \( f(l) = k \) because \( f \) is an involution. However, \( k &lt; l \), so \( f(l) = k &lt; l \), but since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \geq f(k) + 1 = l + 1 \), which leads to a contradiction because \( k &lt; l \) and \( f(l) = k \geq l + 1 \) is impossible. Similarly, if \( f(k) = l &lt; k \), then \( f(l) = k \), but since \( l &lt; k \), \( f(l) = k &gt; l \), which again would require \( f(k) \geq f(l + 1) \geq f(l) + 1 = k + 1 \), which contradicts \( f(k) = l &lt; k \). Therefore, the only possibility is that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Therefore, the identity function is the only strictly increasing involution on \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \). Since our function \( f \) must be a strictly increasing bijection (as established earlier), and also an involution, the only solution is the identity function. Therefore, \( f(m) = m \) for all \( m \).

But let me just check again to make sure I haven&#x27;t missed any other possibilities. Suppose someone suggests another function, like \( f(m) = m + c \) for some constant \( c \). Let&#x27;s test this. Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + c + n + c) = (m + n + 2c) + c = m + n + 3c \). But this must equal \( m + n \), so \( 3c = 0 \), which implies \( c = 0 \). So that brings us back to the identity function.

Another thought: maybe a function that rearranges numbers in some way but still satisfies the condition. For example, suppose \( f(0) = 0 \), \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 1 \), and \( f(k) = k \) for \( k \geq 3 \). Let&#x27;s test this. Take \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \). Then \( f(f(1) + f(1)) = f(2 + 2) = f(4) = 4 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), so 4 ≠ 2. Therefore, this function doesn&#x27;t work. So swapping 1 and 2 causes a problem. Similarly, any swap would cause inconsistencies when the swapped numbers are used in the function&#x27;s arguments.

Alternatively, suppose we have a more complex permutation. But given the condition \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), it&#x27;s challenging to see how a non-identity permutation would satisfy this. For instance, let&#x27;s suppose that \( f(1) = a \), \( f(a) = 1 \). Then, taking \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(a + a) = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \). Then, applying \( f \) again, \( f(2) = 2a \). But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 0 \), we have \( f(2a + 0) = 2 + 0 = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \), which is consistent with the previous result. But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 2 \), we get \( f(2a + 2a) = f(4a) = 4 \). So \( f(4a) = 4 \), which implies \( f(4) = 4a \). Continuing this pattern, we see that if we set \( f(1) = a \), then \( f(2a) = 2 \), \( f(4a) = 4 \), etc. But since \( a \) must be a positive integer (as \( f \) maps to non-negative integers and is a bijection), if \( a &gt; 1 \), then \( 2a &gt; 2 \), so \( f(2a) = 2 \), but then \( f(2) = 2a \), which is greater than 2. But this would disrupt the strictly increasing nature of \( f \). For example, if \( a = 2 \), then \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 4 \), but then \( f(2) = 4 \) which is greater than \( f(3) \) must be 3 (if we follow the identity for other numbers). But that contradicts the strictly increasing requirement because 2 &lt; 3 but \( f(2) = 4 &gt; f(3) = 3 \). Hence, such a function cannot be increasing. Therefore, \( a \) must be 1, leading back to the identity function.

Another angle: suppose the function has some periodic behavior. For example, maybe even numbers are mapped to one sequence and odd numbers to another. But considering the bijectivity and the strictly increasing nature, it&#x27;s unclear how this could work without violating the functional equation. Let&#x27;s attempt a simple case. Suppose \( f(k) = k + 1 \) for even \( k \) and \( f(k) = k - 1 \) for odd \( k \). This swaps even and odd numbers. Let&#x27;s check \( f(f(m) + f(n)) \). Take \( m = 1 \) (odd), so \( f(1) = 0 \). \( n = 1 \), so \( f(1) = 0 \). Then \( f(0 + 0) = f(0) = 1 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), which is not equal to 1. So that doesn&#x27;t work. Another example: if \( f(k) = k + 2 \) for some \( k \), but then injectivity is lost unless it&#x27;s carefully constructed, which seems difficult.

Alternatively, maybe \( f(k) = c - k \) for some constant \( c \). But since the domain is non-negative integers, this would require \( c \geq k \) for all \( k \), which is impossible unless \( c \) is infinity, which isn&#x27;t a number. So that approach doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, but since \( f \) is an involution, another thought: if \( f \) is additive, meaning \( f(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \), but combined with the involution property. However, the given condition is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), which is different from additivity. If \( f \) were additive, then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(f(m)) + f(f(n)) = m + n \), which actually matches the given condition. So if \( f \) is additive and an involution, then it satisfies the equation. However, the only additive function on non-negative integers is linear, i.e., \( f(k) = ak \) for some constant \( a \). But given that \( f \) maps non-negative integers to non-negative integers and is bijective, \( a \) must be 1. Let&#x27;s verify:

Suppose \( f(k) = ak \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = a(a m + a n) = a^2(m + n) \). For this to equal \( m + n \), we need \( a^2 = 1 \), so \( a = 1 \), since \( a \) must be positive. Therefore, the only additive solution is the identity function. Therefore, even considering additive functions doesn&#x27;t give us any new solutions.

So far, all the lines of thought lead back to the identity function as the only solution. But to be thorough, let&#x27;s try to formally prove that \( f(m) = m \) is the only solution.

We already established that \( f \) is a bijection, strictly increasing, and an involution (i.e., \( f(f(k)) = k \) for all \( k \)). Let&#x27;s use induction to prove that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Base case: \( k = 0 \). We already showed \( f(0) = 0 \).

Inductive step: Assume that for all \( j &lt; k \), \( f(j) = j \). We need to show that \( f(k) = k \).

Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) &gt; f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Therefore, \( f(k) \geq k \) (because it has to be greater than all previous values, which are exactly 0, 1, ..., k-1). Suppose for contradiction that \( f(k) &gt; k \). Let \( f(k) = k + t \) where \( t \geq 1 \).

But since \( f \) is a bijection, there must be some \( m \) such that \( f(m) = k \). Because \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( m \) must be greater than or equal to \( k \) (since \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), so the pre-image of \( k \) must be less than \( k \), but wait, \( f \) is strictly increasing, so if \( f(m) = k \), then \( m \) must satisfy \( f(m) = k \). But since \( f \) is strictly increasing and \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), all values \( f(0), f(1), ..., f(k) \) are 0, 1, ..., k - 1, k + t. Therefore, the value \( k \) must be achieved by some \( m &lt; k \), but by the induction hypothesis, for \( m &lt; k \), \( f(m) = m \). Therefore, the only way \( f(m) = k \) is if \( m = k \), but this contradicts the induction hypothesis because \( m &lt; k \) would imply \( f(m) = m \neq k \). Therefore, there is a contradiction, meaning our assumption that \( f(k) &gt; k \) is false. Therefore, \( f(k) = k \).

Therefore, by induction, \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \).

Hence, the only function that satisfies the given condition is the identity function.

**Final Answer**
The only such function is the identity function, so the answer is \boxed{f(n) = n}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), we start by analyzing the given functional equation.

1. **Injectivity and Surjectivity**:
   - **Injectivity**: Suppose \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \) implies \( m + a = m + b \), so \( a = b \). Thus, \( f \) is injective.
   - **Surjectivity**: For any \( k \), setting \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \) gives \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k \). Let \( c = f(k) + f(0) \), then \( f(c) = k \). Thus, \( f \) is surjective.

2. **Bijectivity and Involution**:
   - Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it is bijective.
   - Setting \( m = 0 \) in the functional equation gives \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = n \). Knowing \( f(0) = 0 \) (from testing \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \)), we get \( f(f(n)) = n \). Thus, \( f \) is an involution.

3. **Strictly Increasing Nature**:
   - \( f \) must be strictly increasing. If not, there would be contradictions in the ordering of non-negative integers.

4. **Inductive Proof**:
   - **Base Case**: \( f(0) = 0 \).
   - **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) \geq k \). Suppose \( f(k) &gt; k \), then there must be some \( m &lt; k \) such that \( f(m) = k \), which contradicts the induction hypothesis. Hence, \( f(k) = k \).

Thus, the only function satisfying the given condition is the identity function. The final answer is \(\boxed{f(n) = n}\).          </p>

Therefore, if \( f \) is strictly increasing and an involution, then \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let me verify this. Suppose there exists some \( k \) such that \( f(k) \neq k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, either \( f(k) &gt; k \) or \( f(k) &lt; k \). Suppose \( f(k) = l &gt; k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \). But \( f(l) = k \) because \( f \) is an involution. However, \( k &lt; l \), so \( f(l) = k &lt; l \), but since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \geq f(k) + 1 = l + 1 \), which leads to a contradiction because \( k &lt; l \) and \( f(l) = k \geq l + 1 \) is impossible. Similarly, if \( f(k) = l &lt; k \), then \( f(l) = k \), but since \( l &lt; k \), \( f(l) = k &gt; l \), which again would require \( f(k) \geq f(l + 1) \geq f(l) + 1 = k + 1 \), which contradicts \( f(k) = l &lt; k \). Therefore, the only possibility is that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Therefore, the identity function is the only strictly increasing involution on \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \). Since our function \( f \) must be a strictly increasing bijection (as established earlier), and also an involution, the only solution is the identity function. Therefore, \( f(m) = m \) for all \( m \).

But let me just check again to make sure I haven&#x27;t missed any other possibilities. Suppose someone suggests another function, like \( f(m) = m + c \) for some constant \( c \). Let&#x27;s test this. Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + c + n + c) = (m + n + 2c) + c = m + n + 3c \). But this must equal \( m + n \), so \( 3c = 0 \), which implies \( c = 0 \). So that brings us back to the identity function.

Another thought: maybe a function that rearranges numbers in some way but still satisfies the condition. For example, suppose \( f(0) = 0 \), \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 1 \), and \( f(k) = k \) for \( k \geq 3 \). Let&#x27;s test this. Take \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \). Then \( f(f(1) + f(1)) = f(2 + 2) = f(4) = 4 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), so 4 ≠ 2. Therefore, this function doesn&#x27;t work. So swapping 1 and 2 causes a problem. Similarly, any swap would cause inconsistencies when the swapped numbers are used in the function&#x27;s arguments.

Alternatively, suppose we have a more complex permutation. But given the condition \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), it&#x27;s challenging to see how a non-identity permutation would satisfy this. For instance, let&#x27;s suppose that \( f(1) = a \), \( f(a) = 1 \). Then, taking \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(a + a) = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \). Then, applying \( f \) again, \( f(2) = 2a \). But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 0 \), we have \( f(2a + 0) = 2 + 0 = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \), which is consistent with the previous result. But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 2 \), we get \( f(2a + 2a) = f(4a) = 4 \). So \( f(4a) = 4 \), which implies \( f(4) = 4a \). Continuing this pattern, we see that if we set \( f(1) = a \), then \( f(2a) = 2 \), \( f(4a) = 4 \), etc. But since \( a \) must be a positive integer (as \( f \) maps to non-negative integers and is a bijection), if \( a &gt; 1 \), then \( 2a &gt; 2 \), so \( f(2a) = 2 \), but then \( f(2) = 2a \), which is greater than 2. But this would disrupt the strictly increasing nature of \( f \). For example, if \( a = 2 \), then \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 4 \), but then \( f(2) = 4 \) which is greater than \( f(3) \) must be 3 (if we follow the identity for other numbers). But that contradicts the strictly increasing requirement because 2 &lt; 3 but \( f(2) = 4 &gt; f(3) = 3 \). Hence, such a function cannot be increasing. Therefore, \( a \) must be 1, leading back to the identity function.

Another angle: suppose the function has some periodic behavior. For example, maybe even numbers are mapped to one sequence and odd numbers to another. But considering the bijectivity and the strictly increasing nature, it&#x27;s unclear how this could work without violating the functional equation. Let&#x27;s attempt a simple case. Suppose \( f(k) = k + 1 \) for even \( k \) and \( f(k) = k - 1 \) for odd \( k \). This swaps even and odd numbers. Let&#x27;s check \( f(f(m) + f(n)) \). Take \( m = 1 \) (odd), so \( f(1) = 0 \). \( n = 1 \), so \( f(1) = 0 \). Then \( f(0 + 0) = f(0) = 1 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), which is not equal to 1. So that doesn&#x27;t work. Another example: if \( f(k) = k + 2 \) for some \( k \), but then injectivity is lost unless it&#x27;s carefully constructed, which seems difficult.

Alternatively, maybe \( f(k) = c - k \) for some constant \( c \). But since the domain is non-negative integers, this would require \( c \geq k \) for all \( k \), which is impossible unless \( c \) is infinity, which isn&#x27;t a number. So that approach doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, but since \( f \) is an involution, another thought: if \( f \) is additive, meaning \( f(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \), but combined with the involution property. However, the given condition is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), which is different from additivity. If \( f \) were additive, then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(f(m)) + f(f(n)) = m + n \), which actually matches the given condition. So if \( f \) is additive and an involution, then it satisfies the equation. However, the only additive function on non-negative integers is linear, i.e., \( f(k) = ak \) for some constant \( a \). But given that \( f \) maps non-negative integers to non-negative integers and is bijective, \( a \) must be 1. Let&#x27;s verify:

Suppose \( f(k) = ak \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = a(a m + a n) = a^2(m + n) \). For this to equal \( m + n \), we need \( a^2 = 1 \), so \( a = 1 \), since \( a \) must be positive. Therefore, the only additive solution is the identity function. Therefore, even considering additive functions doesn&#x27;t give us any new solutions.

So far, all the lines of thought lead back to the identity function as the only solution. But to be thorough, let&#x27;s try to formally prove that \( f(m) = m \) is the only solution.

We already established that \( f \) is a bijection, strictly increasing, and an involution (i.e., \( f(f(k)) = k \) for all \( k \)). Let&#x27;s use induction to prove that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Base case: \( k = 0 \). We already showed \( f(0) = 0 \).

Inductive step: Assume that for all \( j &lt; k \), \( f(j) = j \). We need to show that \( f(k) = k \).

Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) &gt; f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Therefore, \( f(k) \geq k \) (because it has to be greater than all previous values, which are exactly 0, 1, ..., k-1). Suppose for contradiction that \( f(k) &gt; k \). Let \( f(k) = k + t \) where \( t \geq 1 \).

But since \( f \) is a bijection, there must be some \( m \) such that \( f(m) = k \). Because \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( m \) must be greater than or equal to \( k \) (since \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), so the pre-image of \( k \) must be less than \( k \), but wait, \( f \) is strictly increasing, so if \( f(m) = k \), then \( m \) must satisfy \( f(m) = k \). But since \( f \) is strictly increasing and \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), all values \( f(0), f(1), ..., f(k) \) are 0, 1, ..., k - 1, k + t. Therefore, the value \( k \) must be achieved by some \( m &lt; k \), but by the induction hypothesis, for \( m &lt; k \), \( f(m) = m \). Therefore, the only way \( f(m) = k \) is if \( m = k \), but this contradicts the induction hypothesis because \( m &lt; k \) would imply \( f(m) = m \neq k \). Therefore, there is a contradiction, meaning our assumption that \( f(k) &gt; k \) is false. Therefore, \( f(k) = k \).

Therefore, by induction, \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \).

Hence, the only function that satisfies the given condition is the identity function.

**Final Answer**
The only such function is the identity function, so the answer is \boxed{f(n) = n}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), we start by analyzing the given functional equation.

1. **Injectivity and Surjectivity**:
   - **Injectivity**: Suppose \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \) implies \( m + a = m + b \), so \( a = b \). Thus, \( f \) is injective.
   - **Surjectivity**: For any \( k \), setting \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \) gives \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k \). Let \( c = f(k) + f(0) \), then \( f(c) = k \). Thus, \( f \) is surjective.

2. **Bijectivity and Involution**:
   - Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it is bijective.
   - Setting \( m = 0 \) in the functional equation gives \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = n \). Knowing \( f(0) = 0 \) (from testing \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \)), we get \( f(f(n)) = n \). Thus, \( f \) is an involution.

3. **Strictly Increasing Nature**:
   - \( f \) must be strictly increasing. If not, there would be contradictions in the ordering of non-negative integers.

4. **Inductive Proof**:
   - **Base Case**: \( f(0) = 0 \).
   - **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) \geq k \). Suppose \( f(k) &gt; k \), then there must be some \( m &lt; k \) such that \( f(m) = k \), which contradicts the induction hypothesis. Hence, \( f(k) = k \).

Thus, the only function satisfying the given condition is the identity function. The final answer is \(\boxed{f(n) = n}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), the equation \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) holds. Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall that \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) means the set of all non-negative integers, which includes 0, 1, 2, and so on. So the function \( f \) takes non-negative integers and maps them to non-negative integers. The condition given is that if I take two numbers \( m \) and \( n \), apply \( f \) to each of them, add the results together, and then apply \( f \) again, I should get \( m + n \). Interesting. So \( f \) composed with addition somehow inverts the process?

Maybe I should start by checking if there are any simple functions that satisfy this. The first one that comes to mind is the identity function, where \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let&#x27;s test that:

If \( f(k) = k \), then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + n) = m + n \), which matches the given condition. So the identity function works. But the problem says &quot;find all functions,&quot; so there might be others, or maybe the identity is the only solution.

But before jumping to conclusions, let&#x27;s see if there are other possibilities. Sometimes functions can be involutions, meaning that applying them twice gives the identity. But in this case, the functional equation isn&#x27;t exactly an involution; it&#x27;s more like a nested function. Let&#x27;s try to analyze the properties that such a function \( f \) must have.

First, is \( f \) injective? Suppose that \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then, for any \( m \), consider \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \). By the given equation, this implies \( m + a = m + b \), which would mean \( a = b \). Therefore, \( f \) is injective.

Okay, so injectivity is established. What about surjectivity? Let&#x27;s see. For any non-negative integer \( k \), we need to find some \( c \) such that \( f(c) = k \). Let&#x27;s pick an arbitrary \( k \). Suppose we set \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \). Then the equation becomes \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k + 0 = k \). Let&#x27;s denote \( c = f(k) + f(0) \). Then \( f(c) = k \). Therefore, for any \( k \), there exists such a \( c \), so \( f \) is surjective.

Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it&#x27;s bijective. That&#x27;s a good start. Bijections have well-defined inverse functions, but since we&#x27;re dealing with non-negative integers, the inverse might not necessarily be a function unless we&#x27;re careful. However, knowing that \( f \) is bijective can help us manipulate the equation.

Let me think. Since \( f \) is bijective, maybe we can express \( f(m) + f(n) \) in terms of the inverse function. Wait, but the equation given is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \). If I denote \( f(m) + f(n) \) as some input to \( f \), which outputs \( m + n \). If \( f \) is invertible, then \( f^{-1}(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \). But wait, inverses of functions on integers can be tricky because they might not exist unless the function is strictly increasing or decreasing. But since \( f \) is bijective, it must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing? Hmm, but in non-negative integers, strictly decreasing would eventually hit zero and negative numbers, which aren&#x27;t allowed. So \( f \) must be strictly increasing.

Therefore, \( f \) is a strictly increasing bijection. That&#x27;s helpful. So, for example, \( f(0) \) is the minimal value of \( f \), which must be 0 or some other number. Wait, but since \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and it&#x27;s a bijection, \( f(0) \) must be 0. Wait, let&#x27;s check that.

If \( f \) is a bijection from \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) to \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \), then it must map 0 to some number. Suppose \( f(0) = a \). Since it&#x27;s a bijection, \( a \) must be unique. Let&#x27;s plug \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \) into the original equation: \( f(f(0) + f(0)) = 0 + 0 = 0 \). So \( f(2a) = 0 \). But \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and since it&#x27;s injective, the only way \( f(2a) = 0 \) is if \( 2a \) is mapped uniquely. But if \( a = f(0) \), then \( a \) must be 0 because otherwise, \( 0 \) would be mapped to by \( 2a \), but \( a \) is already mapped to by 0, and since \( f \) is injective, \( 2a \) can&#x27;t also map to 0 unless \( 2a = a \), which would imply \( a = 0 \). Therefore, \( f(0) = 0 \).

Okay, so \( f(0) = 0 \). That&#x27;s a useful piece of information. Let&#x27;s note that down. So plugging \( m = 0 \) into the original equation gives us \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = 0 + n = n \). Since \( f(0) = 0 \), this simplifies to \( f(f(n)) = n \). Wait, so \( f \) is an involution, meaning that applying it twice gives the identity function. That is, \( f(f(n)) = n \) for all \( n \). That&#x27;s a key property.

So \( f \) is a bijective involution. Therefore, \( f \) is its own inverse. That&#x27;s a crucial observation. So if \( f(k) = l \), then \( f(l) = k \). This is because \( f(f(k)) = k \), so \( f(l) = k \). Therefore, the function pairs numbers in such a way that each pair \( (k, l) \) satisfies \( f(k) = l \) and \( f(l) = k \). However, if \( k = l \), then \( f(k) = k \), so fixed points are allowed. So \( f \) could be a permutation composed of transpositions (swaps of pairs) and fixed points.

But given that the function is strictly increasing (as we concluded earlier because decreasing would lead to contradictions in non-negative integers), then such transpositions would have to be arranged in a way that preserves the increasing order. But transpositions would require swapping elements, which might disrupt the increasing order. For example, if we swap 1 and 2, then \( f(1) = 2 \) and \( f(2) = 1 \), but then \( f(1) = 2 &gt; f(2) = 1 \), which contradicts the strictly increasing nature. Therefore, the only way for \( f \) to be a strictly increasing involution is if it is the identity function. Because any swap would violate the strictly increasing condition.

Therefore, if \( f \) is strictly increasing and an involution, then \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let me verify this. Suppose there exists some \( k \) such that \( f(k) \neq k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, either \( f(k) &gt; k \) or \( f(k) &lt; k \). Suppose \( f(k) = l &gt; k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \). But \( f(l) = k \) because \( f \) is an involution. However, \( k &lt; l \), so \( f(l) = k &lt; l \), but since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \geq f(k) + 1 = l + 1 \), which leads to a contradiction because \( k &lt; l \) and \( f(l) = k \geq l + 1 \) is impossible. Similarly, if \( f(k) = l &lt; k \), then \( f(l) = k \), but since \( l &lt; k \), \( f(l) = k &gt; l \), which again would require \( f(k) \geq f(l + 1) \geq f(l) + 1 = k + 1 \), which contradicts \( f(k) = l &lt; k \). Therefore, the only possibility is that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Therefore, the identity function is the only strictly increasing involution on \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \). Since our function \( f \) must be a strictly increasing bijection (as established earlier), and also an involution, the only solution is the identity function. Therefore, \( f(m) = m \) for all \( m \).

But let me just check again to make sure I haven&#x27;t missed any other possibilities. Suppose someone suggests another function, like \( f(m) = m + c \) for some constant \( c \). Let&#x27;s test this. Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + c + n + c) = (m + n + 2c) + c = m + n + 3c \). But this must equal \( m + n \), so \( 3c = 0 \), which implies \( c = 0 \). So that brings us back to the identity function.

Another thought: maybe a function that rearranges numbers in some way but still satisfies the condition. For example, suppose \( f(0) = 0 \), \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 1 \), and \( f(k) = k \) for \( k \geq 3 \). Let&#x27;s test this. Take \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \). Then \( f(f(1) + f(1)) = f(2 + 2) = f(4) = 4 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), so 4 ≠ 2. Therefore, this function doesn&#x27;t work. So swapping 1 and 2 causes a problem. Similarly, any swap would cause inconsistencies when the swapped numbers are used in the function&#x27;s arguments.

Alternatively, suppose we have a more complex permutation. But given the condition \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), it&#x27;s challenging to see how a non-identity permutation would satisfy this. For instance, let&#x27;s suppose that \( f(1) = a \), \( f(a) = 1 \). Then, taking \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(a + a) = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \). Then, applying \( f \) again, \( f(2) = 2a \). But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 0 \), we have \( f(2a + 0) = 2 + 0 = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \), which is consistent with the previous result. But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 2 \), we get \( f(2a + 2a) = f(4a) = 4 \). So \( f(4a) = 4 \), which implies \( f(4) = 4a \). Continuing this pattern, we see that if we set \( f(1) = a \), then \( f(2a) = 2 \), \( f(4a) = 4 \), etc. But since \( a \) must be a positive integer (as \( f \) maps to non-negative integers and is a bijection), if \( a &gt; 1 \), then \( 2a &gt; 2 \), so \( f(2a) = 2 \), but then \( f(2) = 2a \), which is greater than 2. But this would disrupt the strictly increasing nature of \( f \). For example, if \( a = 2 \), then \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 4 \), but then \( f(2) = 4 \) which is greater than \( f(3) \) must be 3 (if we follow the identity for other numbers). But that contradicts the strictly increasing requirement because 2 &lt; 3 but \( f(2) = 4 &gt; f(3) = 3 \). Hence, such a function cannot be increasing. Therefore, \( a \) must be 1, leading back to the identity function.

Another angle: suppose the function has some periodic behavior. For example, maybe even numbers are mapped to one sequence and odd numbers to another. But considering the bijectivity and the strictly increasing nature, it&#x27;s unclear how this could work without violating the functional equation. Let&#x27;s attempt a simple case. Suppose \( f(k) = k + 1 \) for even \( k \) and \( f(k) = k - 1 \) for odd \( k \). This swaps even and odd numbers. Let&#x27;s check \( f(f(m) + f(n)) \). Take \( m = 1 \) (odd), so \( f(1) = 0 \). \( n = 1 \), so \( f(1) = 0 \). Then \( f(0 + 0) = f(0) = 1 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), which is not equal to 1. So that doesn&#x27;t work. Another example: if \( f(k) = k + 2 \) for some \( k \), but then injectivity is lost unless it&#x27;s carefully constructed, which seems difficult.

Alternatively, maybe \( f(k) = c - k \) for some constant \( c \). But since the domain is non-negative integers, this would require \( c \geq k \) for all \( k \), which is impossible unless \( c \) is infinity, which isn&#x27;t a number. So that approach doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, but since \( f \) is an involution, another thought: if \( f \) is additive, meaning \( f(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \), but combined with the involution property. However, the given condition is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), which is different from additivity. If \( f \) were additive, then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(f(m)) + f(f(n)) = m + n \), which actually matches the given condition. So if \( f \) is additive and an involution, then it satisfies the equation. However, the only additive function on non-negative integers is linear, i.e., \( f(k) = ak \) for some constant \( a \). But given that \( f \) maps non-negative integers to non-negative integers and is bijective, \( a \) must be 1. Let&#x27;s verify:

Suppose \( f(k) = ak \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = a(a m + a n) = a^2(m + n) \). For this to equal \( m + n \), we need \( a^2 = 1 \), so \( a = 1 \), since \( a \) must be positive. Therefore, the only additive solution is the identity function. Therefore, even considering additive functions doesn&#x27;t give us any new solutions.

So far, all the lines of thought lead back to the identity function as the only solution. But to be thorough, let&#x27;s try to formally prove that \( f(m) = m \) is the only solution.

We already established that \( f \) is a bijection, strictly increasing, and an involution (i.e., \( f(f(k)) = k \) for all \( k \)). Let&#x27;s use induction to prove that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Base case: \( k = 0 \). We already showed \( f(0) = 0 \).

Inductive step: Assume that for all \( j &lt; k \), \( f(j) = j \). We need to show that \( f(k) = k \).

Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) &gt; f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Therefore, \( f(k) \geq k \) (because it has to be greater than all previous values, which are exactly 0, 1, ..., k-1). Suppose for contradiction that \( f(k) &gt; k \). Let \( f(k) = k + t \) where \( t \geq 1 \).

But since \( f \) is a bijection, there must be some \( m \) such that \( f(m) = k \). Because \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( m \) must be greater than or equal to \( k \) (since \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), so the pre-image of \( k \) must be less than \( k \), but wait, \( f \) is strictly increasing, so if \( f(m) = k \), then \( m \) must satisfy \( f(m) = k \). But since \( f \) is strictly increasing and \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), all values \( f(0), f(1), ..., f(k) \) are 0, 1, ..., k - 1, k + t. Therefore, the value \( k \) must be achieved by some \( m &lt; k \), but by the induction hypothesis, for \( m &lt; k \), \( f(m) = m \). Therefore, the only way \( f(m) = k \) is if \( m = k \), but this contradicts the induction hypothesis because \( m &lt; k \) would imply \( f(m) = m \neq k \). Therefore, there is a contradiction, meaning our assumption that \( f(k) &gt; k \) is false. Therefore, \( f(k) = k \).

Therefore, by induction, \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \).

Hence, the only function that satisfies the given condition is the identity function.

**Final Answer**
The only such function is the identity function, so the answer is \boxed{f(n) = n}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), we start by analyzing the given functional equation.

1. **Injectivity and Surjectivity**:
   - **Injectivity**: Suppose \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \) implies \( m + a = m + b \), so \( a = b \). Thus, \( f \) is injective.
   - **Surjectivity**: For any \( k \), setting \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \) gives \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k \). Let \( c = f(k) + f(0) \), then \( f(c) = k \). Thus, \( f \) is surjective.

2. **Bijectivity and Involution**:
   - Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it is bijective.
   - Setting \( m = 0 \) in the functional equation gives \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = n \). Knowing \( f(0) = 0 \) (from testing \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \)), we get \( f(f(n)) = n \). Thus, \( f \) is an involution.

3. **Strictly Increasing Nature**:
   - \( f \) must be strictly increasing. If not, there would be contradictions in the ordering of non-negative integers.

4. **Inductive Proof**:
   - **Base Case**: \( f(0) = 0 \).
   - **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) \geq k \). Suppose \( f(k) &gt; k \), then there must be some \( m &lt; k \) such that \( f(m) = k \), which contradicts the induction hypothesis. Hence, \( f(k) = k \).

Thus, the only function satisfying the given condition is the identity function. The final answer is \(\boxed{f(n) = n}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), the equation \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) holds. Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall that \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) means the set of all non-negative integers, which includes 0, 1, 2, and so on. So the function \( f \) takes non-negative integers and maps them to non-negative integers. The condition given is that if I take two numbers \( m \) and \( n \), apply \( f \) to each of them, add the results together, and then apply \( f \) again, I should get \( m + n \). Interesting. So \( f \) composed with addition somehow inverts the process?

Maybe I should start by checking if there are any simple functions that satisfy this. The first one that comes to mind is the identity function, where \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let&#x27;s test that:

If \( f(k) = k \), then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + n) = m + n \), which matches the given condition. So the identity function works. But the problem says &quot;find all functions,&quot; so there might be others, or maybe the identity is the only solution.

But before jumping to conclusions, let&#x27;s see if there are other possibilities. Sometimes functions can be involutions, meaning that applying them twice gives the identity. But in this case, the functional equation isn&#x27;t exactly an involution; it&#x27;s more like a nested function. Let&#x27;s try to analyze the properties that such a function \( f \) must have.

First, is \( f \) injective? Suppose that \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then, for any \( m \), consider \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \). By the given equation, this implies \( m + a = m + b \), which would mean \( a = b \). Therefore, \( f \) is injective.

Okay, so injectivity is established. What about surjectivity? Let&#x27;s see. For any non-negative integer \( k \), we need to find some \( c \) such that \( f(c) = k \). Let&#x27;s pick an arbitrary \( k \). Suppose we set \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \). Then the equation becomes \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k + 0 = k \). Let&#x27;s denote \( c = f(k) + f(0) \). Then \( f(c) = k \). Therefore, for any \( k \), there exists such a \( c \), so \( f \) is surjective.

Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it&#x27;s bijective. That&#x27;s a good start. Bijections have well-defined inverse functions, but since we&#x27;re dealing with non-negative integers, the inverse might not necessarily be a function unless we&#x27;re careful. However, knowing that \( f \) is bijective can help us manipulate the equation.

Let me think. Since \( f \) is bijective, maybe we can express \( f(m) + f(n) \) in terms of the inverse function. Wait, but the equation given is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \). If I denote \( f(m) + f(n) \) as some input to \( f \), which outputs \( m + n \). If \( f \) is invertible, then \( f^{-1}(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \). But wait, inverses of functions on integers can be tricky because they might not exist unless the function is strictly increasing or decreasing. But since \( f \) is bijective, it must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing? Hmm, but in non-negative integers, strictly decreasing would eventually hit zero and negative numbers, which aren&#x27;t allowed. So \( f \) must be strictly increasing.

Therefore, \( f \) is a strictly increasing bijection. That&#x27;s helpful. So, for example, \( f(0) \) is the minimal value of \( f \), which must be 0 or some other number. Wait, but since \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and it&#x27;s a bijection, \( f(0) \) must be 0. Wait, let&#x27;s check that.

If \( f \) is a bijection from \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) to \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \), then it must map 0 to some number. Suppose \( f(0) = a \). Since it&#x27;s a bijection, \( a \) must be unique. Let&#x27;s plug \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \) into the original equation: \( f(f(0) + f(0)) = 0 + 0 = 0 \). So \( f(2a) = 0 \). But \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and since it&#x27;s injective, the only way \( f(2a) = 0 \) is if \( 2a \) is mapped uniquely. But if \( a = f(0) \), then \( a \) must be 0 because otherwise, \( 0 \) would be mapped to by \( 2a \), but \( a \) is already mapped to by 0, and since \( f \) is injective, \( 2a \) can&#x27;t also map to 0 unless \( 2a = a \), which would imply \( a = 0 \). Therefore, \( f(0) = 0 \).

Okay, so \( f(0) = 0 \). That&#x27;s a useful piece of information. Let&#x27;s note that down. So plugging \( m = 0 \) into the original equation gives us \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = 0 + n = n \). Since \( f(0) = 0 \), this simplifies to \( f(f(n)) = n \). Wait, so \( f \) is an involution, meaning that applying it twice gives the identity function. That is, \( f(f(n)) = n \) for all \( n \). That&#x27;s a key property.

So \( f \) is a bijective involution. Therefore, \( f \) is its own inverse. That&#x27;s a crucial observation. So if \( f(k) = l \), then \( f(l) = k \). This is because \( f(f(k)) = k \), so \( f(l) = k \). Therefore, the function pairs numbers in such a way that each pair \( (k, l) \) satisfies \( f(k) = l \) and \( f(l) = k \). However, if \( k = l \), then \( f(k) = k \), so fixed points are allowed. So \( f \) could be a permutation composed of transpositions (swaps of pairs) and fixed points.

But given that the function is strictly increasing (as we concluded earlier because decreasing would lead to contradictions in non-negative integers), then such transpositions would have to be arranged in a way that preserves the increasing order. But transpositions would require swapping elements, which might disrupt the increasing order. For example, if we swap 1 and 2, then \( f(1) = 2 \) and \( f(2) = 1 \), but then \( f(1) = 2 &gt; f(2) = 1 \), which contradicts the strictly increasing nature. Therefore, the only way for \( f \) to be a strictly increasing involution is if it is the identity function. Because any swap would violate the strictly increasing condition.

Therefore, if \( f \) is strictly increasing and an involution, then \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let me verify this. Suppose there exists some \( k \) such that \( f(k) \neq k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, either \( f(k) &gt; k \) or \( f(k) &lt; k \). Suppose \( f(k) = l &gt; k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \). But \( f(l) = k \) because \( f \) is an involution. However, \( k &lt; l \), so \( f(l) = k &lt; l \), but since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \geq f(k) + 1 = l + 1 \), which leads to a contradiction because \( k &lt; l \) and \( f(l) = k \geq l + 1 \) is impossible. Similarly, if \( f(k) = l &lt; k \), then \( f(l) = k \), but since \( l &lt; k \), \( f(l) = k &gt; l \), which again would require \( f(k) \geq f(l + 1) \geq f(l) + 1 = k + 1 \), which contradicts \( f(k) = l &lt; k \). Therefore, the only possibility is that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Therefore, the identity function is the only strictly increasing involution on \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \). Since our function \( f \) must be a strictly increasing bijection (as established earlier), and also an involution, the only solution is the identity function. Therefore, \( f(m) = m \) for all \( m \).

But let me just check again to make sure I haven&#x27;t missed any other possibilities. Suppose someone suggests another function, like \( f(m) = m + c \) for some constant \( c \). Let&#x27;s test this. Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + c + n + c) = (m + n + 2c) + c = m + n + 3c \). But this must equal \( m + n \), so \( 3c = 0 \), which implies \( c = 0 \). So that brings us back to the identity function.

Another thought: maybe a function that rearranges numbers in some way but still satisfies the condition. For example, suppose \( f(0) = 0 \), \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 1 \), and \( f(k) = k \) for \( k \geq 3 \). Let&#x27;s test this. Take \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \). Then \( f(f(1) + f(1)) = f(2 + 2) = f(4) = 4 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), so 4 ≠ 2. Therefore, this function doesn&#x27;t work. So swapping 1 and 2 causes a problem. Similarly, any swap would cause inconsistencies when the swapped numbers are used in the function&#x27;s arguments.

Alternatively, suppose we have a more complex permutation. But given the condition \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), it&#x27;s challenging to see how a non-identity permutation would satisfy this. For instance, let&#x27;s suppose that \( f(1) = a \), \( f(a) = 1 \). Then, taking \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(a + a) = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \). Then, applying \( f \) again, \( f(2) = 2a \). But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 0 \), we have \( f(2a + 0) = 2 + 0 = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \), which is consistent with the previous result. But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 2 \), we get \( f(2a + 2a) = f(4a) = 4 \). So \( f(4a) = 4 \), which implies \( f(4) = 4a \). Continuing this pattern, we see that if we set \( f(1) = a \), then \( f(2a) = 2 \), \( f(4a) = 4 \), etc. But since \( a \) must be a positive integer (as \( f \) maps to non-negative integers and is a bijection), if \( a &gt; 1 \), then \( 2a &gt; 2 \), so \( f(2a) = 2 \), but then \( f(2) = 2a \), which is greater than 2. But this would disrupt the strictly increasing nature of \( f \). For example, if \( a = 2 \), then \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 4 \), but then \( f(2) = 4 \) which is greater than \( f(3) \) must be 3 (if we follow the identity for other numbers). But that contradicts the strictly increasing requirement because 2 &lt; 3 but \( f(2) = 4 &gt; f(3) = 3 \). Hence, such a function cannot be increasing. Therefore, \( a \) must be 1, leading back to the identity function.

Another angle: suppose the function has some periodic behavior. For example, maybe even numbers are mapped to one sequence and odd numbers to another. But considering the bijectivity and the strictly increasing nature, it&#x27;s unclear how this could work without violating the functional equation. Let&#x27;s attempt a simple case. Suppose \( f(k) = k + 1 \) for even \( k \) and \( f(k) = k - 1 \) for odd \( k \). This swaps even and odd numbers. Let&#x27;s check \( f(f(m) + f(n)) \). Take \( m = 1 \) (odd), so \( f(1) = 0 \). \( n = 1 \), so \( f(1) = 0 \). Then \( f(0 + 0) = f(0) = 1 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), which is not equal to 1. So that doesn&#x27;t work. Another example: if \( f(k) = k + 2 \) for some \( k \), but then injectivity is lost unless it&#x27;s carefully constructed, which seems difficult.

Alternatively, maybe \( f(k) = c - k \) for some constant \( c \). But since the domain is non-negative integers, this would require \( c \geq k \) for all \( k \), which is impossible unless \( c \) is infinity, which isn&#x27;t a number. So that approach doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, but since \( f \) is an involution, another thought: if \( f \) is additive, meaning \( f(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \), but combined with the involution property. However, the given condition is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), which is different from additivity. If \( f \) were additive, then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(f(m)) + f(f(n)) = m + n \), which actually matches the given condition. So if \( f \) is additive and an involution, then it satisfies the equation. However, the only additive function on non-negative integers is linear, i.e., \( f(k) = ak \) for some constant \( a \). But given that \( f \) maps non-negative integers to non-negative integers and is bijective, \( a \) must be 1. Let&#x27;s verify:

Suppose \( f(k) = ak \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = a(a m + a n) = a^2(m + n) \). For this to equal \( m + n \), we need \( a^2 = 1 \), so \( a = 1 \), since \( a \) must be positive. Therefore, the only additive solution is the identity function. Therefore, even considering additive functions doesn&#x27;t give us any new solutions.

So far, all the lines of thought lead back to the identity function as the only solution. But to be thorough, let&#x27;s try to formally prove that \( f(m) = m \) is the only solution.

We already established that \( f \) is a bijection, strictly increasing, and an involution (i.e., \( f(f(k)) = k \) for all \( k \)). Let&#x27;s use induction to prove that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Base case: \( k = 0 \). We already showed \( f(0) = 0 \).

Inductive step: Assume that for all \( j &lt; k \), \( f(j) = j \). We need to show that \( f(k) = k \).

Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) &gt; f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Therefore, \( f(k) \geq k \) (because it has to be greater than all previous values, which are exactly 0, 1, ..., k-1). Suppose for contradiction that \( f(k) &gt; k \). Let \( f(k) = k + t \) where \( t \geq 1 \).

But since \( f \) is a bijection, there must be some \( m \) such that \( f(m) = k \). Because \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( m \) must be greater than or equal to \( k \) (since \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), so the pre-image of \( k \) must be less than \( k \), but wait, \( f \) is strictly increasing, so if \( f(m) = k \), then \( m \) must satisfy \( f(m) = k \). But since \( f \) is strictly increasing and \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), all values \( f(0), f(1), ..., f(k) \) are 0, 1, ..., k - 1, k + t. Therefore, the value \( k \) must be achieved by some \( m &lt; k \), but by the induction hypothesis, for \( m &lt; k \), \( f(m) = m \). Therefore, the only way \( f(m) = k \) is if \( m = k \), but this contradicts the induction hypothesis because \( m &lt; k \) would imply \( f(m) = m \neq k \). Therefore, there is a contradiction, meaning our assumption that \( f(k) &gt; k \) is false. Therefore, \( f(k) = k \).

Therefore, by induction, \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \).

Hence, the only function that satisfies the given condition is the identity function.

**Final Answer**
The only such function is the identity function, so the answer is \boxed{f(n) = n}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), we start by analyzing the given functional equation.

   - **Injectivity**: Suppose \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \) implies \( m + a = m + b \), so \( a = b \). Thus, \( f \) is injective.
   - **Surjectivity**: For any \( k \), setting \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \) gives \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k \). Let \( c = f(k) + f(0) \), then \( f(c) = k \). Thus, \( f \) is surjective.

2. **Bijectivity and Involution**:
   - Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it is bijective.
   - Setting \( m = 0 \) in the functional equation gives \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = n \). Knowing \( f(0) = 0 \) (from testing \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \)), we get \( f(f(n)) = n \). Thus, \( f \) is an involution.

3. **Strictly Increasing Nature**:
   - \( f \) must be strictly increasing. If not, there would be contradictions in the ordering of non-negative integers.

4. **Inductive Proof**:
   - **Base Case**: \( f(0) = 0 \).
   - **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) \geq k \). Suppose \( f(k) &gt; k \), then there must be some \( m &lt; k \) such that \( f(m) = k \), which contradicts the induction hypothesis. Hence, \( f(k) = k \).

Thus, the only function satisfying the given condition is the identity function. The final answer is \(\boxed{f(n) = n}\).          </p>

Therefore, \( f \) is a strictly increasing bijection. That&#x27;s helpful. So, for example, \( f(0) \) is the minimal value of \( f \), which must be 0 or some other number. Wait, but since \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and it&#x27;s a bijection, \( f(0) \) must be 0. Wait, let&#x27;s check that.

If \( f \) is a bijection from \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) to \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \), then it must map 0 to some number. Suppose \( f(0) = a \). Since it&#x27;s a bijection, \( a \) must be unique. Let&#x27;s plug \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \) into the original equation: \( f(f(0) + f(0)) = 0 + 0 = 0 \). So \( f(2a) = 0 \). But \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and since it&#x27;s injective, the only way \( f(2a) = 0 \) is if \( 2a \) is mapped uniquely. But if \( a = f(0) \), then \( a \) must be 0 because otherwise, \( 0 \) would be mapped to by \( 2a \), but \( a \) is already mapped to by 0, and since \( f \) is injective, \( 2a \) can&#x27;t also map to 0 unless \( 2a = a \), which would imply \( a = 0 \). Therefore, \( f(0) = 0 \).

Okay, so \( f(0) = 0 \). That&#x27;s a useful piece of information. Let&#x27;s note that down. So plugging \( m = 0 \) into the original equation gives us \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = 0 + n = n \). Since \( f(0) = 0 \), this simplifies to \( f(f(n)) = n \). Wait, so \( f \) is an involution, meaning that applying it twice gives the identity function. That is, \( f(f(n)) = n \) for all \( n \). That&#x27;s a key property.

So \( f \) is a bijective involution. Therefore, \( f \) is its own inverse. That&#x27;s a crucial observation. So if \( f(k) = l \), then \( f(l) = k \). This is because \( f(f(k)) = k \), so \( f(l) = k \). Therefore, the function pairs numbers in such a way that each pair \( (k, l) \) satisfies \( f(k) = l \) and \( f(l) = k \). However, if \( k = l \), then \( f(k) = k \), so fixed points are allowed. So \( f \) could be a permutation composed of transpositions (swaps of pairs) and fixed points.

But given that the function is strictly increasing (as we concluded earlier because decreasing would lead to contradictions in non-negative integers), then such transpositions would have to be arranged in a way that preserves the increasing order. But transpositions would require swapping elements, which might disrupt the increasing order. For example, if we swap 1 and 2, then \( f(1) = 2 \) and \( f(2) = 1 \), but then \( f(1) = 2 &gt; f(2) = 1 \), which contradicts the strictly increasing nature. Therefore, the only way for \( f \) to be a strictly increasing involution is if it is the identity function. Because any swap would violate the strictly increasing condition.

Therefore, if \( f \) is strictly increasing and an involution, then \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let me verify this. Suppose there exists some \( k \) such that \( f(k) \neq k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, either \( f(k) &gt; k \) or \( f(k) &lt; k \). Suppose \( f(k) = l &gt; k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \). But \( f(l) = k \) because \( f \) is an involution. However, \( k &lt; l \), so \( f(l) = k &lt; l \), but since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \geq f(k) + 1 = l + 1 \), which leads to a contradiction because \( k &lt; l \) and \( f(l) = k \geq l + 1 \) is impossible. Similarly, if \( f(k) = l &lt; k \), then \( f(l) = k \), but since \( l &lt; k \), \( f(l) = k &gt; l \), which again would require \( f(k) \geq f(l + 1) \geq f(l) + 1 = k + 1 \), which contradicts \( f(k) = l &lt; k \). Therefore, the only possibility is that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Therefore, the identity function is the only strictly increasing involution on \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \). Since our function \( f \) must be a strictly increasing bijection (as established earlier), and also an involution, the only solution is the identity function. Therefore, \( f(m) = m \) for all \( m \).

But let me just check again to make sure I haven&#x27;t missed any other possibilities. Suppose someone suggests another function, like \( f(m) = m + c \) for some constant \( c \). Let&#x27;s test this. Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + c + n + c) = (m + n + 2c) + c = m + n + 3c \). But this must equal \( m + n \), so \( 3c = 0 \), which implies \( c = 0 \). So that brings us back to the identity function.

Another thought: maybe a function that rearranges numbers in some way but still satisfies the condition. For example, suppose \( f(0) = 0 \), \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 1 \), and \( f(k) = k \) for \( k \geq 3 \). Let&#x27;s test this. Take \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \). Then \( f(f(1) + f(1)) = f(2 + 2) = f(4) = 4 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), so 4 ≠ 2. Therefore, this function doesn&#x27;t work. So swapping 1 and 2 causes a problem. Similarly, any swap would cause inconsistencies when the swapped numbers are used in the function&#x27;s arguments.

Alternatively, suppose we have a more complex permutation. But given the condition \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), it&#x27;s challenging to see how a non-identity permutation would satisfy this. For instance, let&#x27;s suppose that \( f(1) = a \), \( f(a) = 1 \). Then, taking \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(a + a) = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \). Then, applying \( f \) again, \( f(2) = 2a \). But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 0 \), we have \( f(2a + 0) = 2 + 0 = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \), which is consistent with the previous result. But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 2 \), we get \( f(2a + 2a) = f(4a) = 4 \). So \( f(4a) = 4 \), which implies \( f(4) = 4a \). Continuing this pattern, we see that if we set \( f(1) = a \), then \( f(2a) = 2 \), \( f(4a) = 4 \), etc. But since \( a \) must be a positive integer (as \( f \) maps to non-negative integers and is a bijection), if \( a &gt; 1 \), then \( 2a &gt; 2 \), so \( f(2a) = 2 \), but then \( f(2) = 2a \), which is greater than 2. But this would disrupt the strictly increasing nature of \( f \). For example, if \( a = 2 \), then \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 4 \), but then \( f(2) = 4 \) which is greater than \( f(3) \) must be 3 (if we follow the identity for other numbers). But that contradicts the strictly increasing requirement because 2 &lt; 3 but \( f(2) = 4 &gt; f(3) = 3 \). Hence, such a function cannot be increasing. Therefore, \( a \) must be 1, leading back to the identity function.

Another angle: suppose the function has some periodic behavior. For example, maybe even numbers are mapped to one sequence and odd numbers to another. But considering the bijectivity and the strictly increasing nature, it&#x27;s unclear how this could work without violating the functional equation. Let&#x27;s attempt a simple case. Suppose \( f(k) = k + 1 \) for even \( k \) and \( f(k) = k - 1 \) for odd \( k \). This swaps even and odd numbers. Let&#x27;s check \( f(f(m) + f(n)) \). Take \( m = 1 \) (odd), so \( f(1) = 0 \). \( n = 1 \), so \( f(1) = 0 \). Then \( f(0 + 0) = f(0) = 1 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), which is not equal to 1. So that doesn&#x27;t work. Another example: if \( f(k) = k + 2 \) for some \( k \), but then injectivity is lost unless it&#x27;s carefully constructed, which seems difficult.

Alternatively, maybe \( f(k) = c - k \) for some constant \( c \). But since the domain is non-negative integers, this would require \( c \geq k \) for all \( k \), which is impossible unless \( c \) is infinity, which isn&#x27;t a number. So that approach doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, but since \( f \) is an involution, another thought: if \( f \) is additive, meaning \( f(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \), but combined with the involution property. However, the given condition is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), which is different from additivity. If \( f \) were additive, then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(f(m)) + f(f(n)) = m + n \), which actually matches the given condition. So if \( f \) is additive and an involution, then it satisfies the equation. However, the only additive function on non-negative integers is linear, i.e., \( f(k) = ak \) for some constant \( a \). But given that \( f \) maps non-negative integers to non-negative integers and is bijective, \( a \) must be 1. Let&#x27;s verify:

Suppose \( f(k) = ak \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = a(a m + a n) = a^2(m + n) \). For this to equal \( m + n \), we need \( a^2 = 1 \), so \( a = 1 \), since \( a \) must be positive. Therefore, the only additive solution is the identity function. Therefore, even considering additive functions doesn&#x27;t give us any new solutions.

So far, all the lines of thought lead back to the identity function as the only solution. But to be thorough, let&#x27;s try to formally prove that \( f(m) = m \) is the only solution.

We already established that \( f \) is a bijection, strictly increasing, and an involution (i.e., \( f(f(k)) = k \) for all \( k \)). Let&#x27;s use induction to prove that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Base case: \( k = 0 \). We already showed \( f(0) = 0 \).

Inductive step: Assume that for all \( j &lt; k \), \( f(j) = j \). We need to show that \( f(k) = k \).

Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) &gt; f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Therefore, \( f(k) \geq k \) (because it has to be greater than all previous values, which are exactly 0, 1, ..., k-1). Suppose for contradiction that \( f(k) &gt; k \). Let \( f(k) = k + t \) where \( t \geq 1 \).

But since \( f \) is a bijection, there must be some \( m \) such that \( f(m) = k \). Because \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( m \) must be greater than or equal to \( k \) (since \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), so the pre-image of \( k \) must be less than \( k \), but wait, \( f \) is strictly increasing, so if \( f(m) = k \), then \( m \) must satisfy \( f(m) = k \). But since \( f \) is strictly increasing and \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), all values \( f(0), f(1), ..., f(k) \) are 0, 1, ..., k - 1, k + t. Therefore, the value \( k \) must be achieved by some \( m &lt; k \), but by the induction hypothesis, for \( m &lt; k \), \( f(m) = m \). Therefore, the only way \( f(m) = k \) is if \( m = k \), but this contradicts the induction hypothesis because \( m &lt; k \) would imply \( f(m) = m \neq k \). Therefore, there is a contradiction, meaning our assumption that \( f(k) &gt; k \) is false. Therefore, \( f(k) = k \).

Therefore, by induction, \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \).

Hence, the only function that satisfies the given condition is the identity function.

**Final Answer**
The only such function is the identity function, so the answer is \boxed{f(n) = n}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), we start by analyzing the given functional equation.

1. **Injectivity and Surjectivity**:
   - **Injectivity**: Suppose \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \) implies \( m + a = m + b \), so \( a = b \). Thus, \( f \) is injective.
   - **Surjectivity**: For any \( k \), setting \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \) gives \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k \). Let \( c = f(k) + f(0) \), then \( f(c) = k \). Thus, \( f \) is surjective.

2. **Bijectivity and Involution**:
   - Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it is bijective.
   - Setting \( m = 0 \) in the functional equation gives \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = n \). Knowing \( f(0) = 0 \) (from testing \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \)), we get \( f(f(n)) = n \). Thus, \( f \) is an involution.

3. **Strictly Increasing Nature**:
   - \( f \) must be strictly increasing. If not, there would be contradictions in the ordering of non-negative integers.

4. **Inductive Proof**:
   - **Base Case**: \( f(0) = 0 \).
   - **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) \geq k \). Suppose \( f(k) &gt; k \), then there must be some \( m &lt; k \) such that \( f(m) = k \), which contradicts the induction hypothesis. Hence, \( f(k) = k \).

Thus, the only function satisfying the given condition is the identity function. The final answer is \(\boxed{f(n) = n}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), the equation \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) holds. Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall that \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) means the set of all non-negative integers, which includes 0, 1, 2, and so on. So the function \( f \) takes non-negative integers and maps them to non-negative integers. The condition given is that if I take two numbers \( m \) and \( n \), apply \( f \) to each of them, add the results together, and then apply \( f \) again, I should get \( m + n \). Interesting. So \( f \) composed with addition somehow inverts the process?

Maybe I should start by checking if there are any simple functions that satisfy this. The first one that comes to mind is the identity function, where \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let&#x27;s test that:

If \( f(k) = k \), then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + n) = m + n \), which matches the given condition. So the identity function works. But the problem says &quot;find all functions,&quot; so there might be others, or maybe the identity is the only solution.

But before jumping to conclusions, let&#x27;s see if there are other possibilities. Sometimes functions can be involutions, meaning that applying them twice gives the identity. But in this case, the functional equation isn&#x27;t exactly an involution; it&#x27;s more like a nested function. Let&#x27;s try to analyze the properties that such a function \( f \) must have.

First, is \( f \) injective? Suppose that \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then, for any \( m \), consider \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \). By the given equation, this implies \( m + a = m + b \), which would mean \( a = b \). Therefore, \( f \) is injective.

Okay, so injectivity is established. What about surjectivity? Let&#x27;s see. For any non-negative integer \( k \), we need to find some \( c \) such that \( f(c) = k \). Let&#x27;s pick an arbitrary \( k \). Suppose we set \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \). Then the equation becomes \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k + 0 = k \). Let&#x27;s denote \( c = f(k) + f(0) \). Then \( f(c) = k \). Therefore, for any \( k \), there exists such a \( c \), so \( f \) is surjective.

Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it&#x27;s bijective. That&#x27;s a good start. Bijections have well-defined inverse functions, but since we&#x27;re dealing with non-negative integers, the inverse might not necessarily be a function unless we&#x27;re careful. However, knowing that \( f \) is bijective can help us manipulate the equation.

Let me think. Since \( f \) is bijective, maybe we can express \( f(m) + f(n) \) in terms of the inverse function. Wait, but the equation given is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \). If I denote \( f(m) + f(n) \) as some input to \( f \), which outputs \( m + n \). If \( f \) is invertible, then \( f^{-1}(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \). But wait, inverses of functions on integers can be tricky because they might not exist unless the function is strictly increasing or decreasing. But since \( f \) is bijective, it must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing? Hmm, but in non-negative integers, strictly decreasing would eventually hit zero and negative numbers, which aren&#x27;t allowed. So \( f \) must be strictly increasing.

Therefore, \( f \) is a strictly increasing bijection. That&#x27;s helpful. So, for example, \( f(0) \) is the minimal value of \( f \), which must be 0 or some other number. Wait, but since \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and it&#x27;s a bijection, \( f(0) \) must be 0. Wait, let&#x27;s check that.

If \( f \) is a bijection from \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) to \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \), then it must map 0 to some number. Suppose \( f(0) = a \). Since it&#x27;s a bijection, \( a \) must be unique. Let&#x27;s plug \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \) into the original equation: \( f(f(0) + f(0)) = 0 + 0 = 0 \). So \( f(2a) = 0 \). But \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and since it&#x27;s injective, the only way \( f(2a) = 0 \) is if \( 2a \) is mapped uniquely. But if \( a = f(0) \), then \( a \) must be 0 because otherwise, \( 0 \) would be mapped to by \( 2a \), but \( a \) is already mapped to by 0, and since \( f \) is injective, \( 2a \) can&#x27;t also map to 0 unless \( 2a = a \), which would imply \( a = 0 \). Therefore, \( f(0) = 0 \).

Okay, so \( f(0) = 0 \). That&#x27;s a useful piece of information. Let&#x27;s note that down. So plugging \( m = 0 \) into the original equation gives us \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = 0 + n = n \). Since \( f(0) = 0 \), this simplifies to \( f(f(n)) = n \). Wait, so \( f \) is an involution, meaning that applying it twice gives the identity function. That is, \( f(f(n)) = n \) for all \( n \). That&#x27;s a key property.

So \( f \) is a bijective involution. Therefore, \( f \) is its own inverse. That&#x27;s a crucial observation. So if \( f(k) = l \), then \( f(l) = k \). This is because \( f(f(k)) = k \), so \( f(l) = k \). Therefore, the function pairs numbers in such a way that each pair \( (k, l) \) satisfies \( f(k) = l \) and \( f(l) = k \). However, if \( k = l \), then \( f(k) = k \), so fixed points are allowed. So \( f \) could be a permutation composed of transpositions (swaps of pairs) and fixed points.

But given that the function is strictly increasing (as we concluded earlier because decreasing would lead to contradictions in non-negative integers), then such transpositions would have to be arranged in a way that preserves the increasing order. But transpositions would require swapping elements, which might disrupt the increasing order. For example, if we swap 1 and 2, then \( f(1) = 2 \) and \( f(2) = 1 \), but then \( f(1) = 2 &gt; f(2) = 1 \), which contradicts the strictly increasing nature. Therefore, the only way for \( f \) to be a strictly increasing involution is if it is the identity function. Because any swap would violate the strictly increasing condition.

Therefore, if \( f \) is strictly increasing and an involution, then \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let me verify this. Suppose there exists some \( k \) such that \( f(k) \neq k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, either \( f(k) &gt; k \) or \( f(k) &lt; k \). Suppose \( f(k) = l &gt; k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \). But \( f(l) = k \) because \( f \) is an involution. However, \( k &lt; l \), so \( f(l) = k &lt; l \), but since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \geq f(k) + 1 = l + 1 \), which leads to a contradiction because \( k &lt; l \) and \( f(l) = k \geq l + 1 \) is impossible. Similarly, if \( f(k) = l &lt; k \), then \( f(l) = k \), but since \( l &lt; k \), \( f(l) = k &gt; l \), which again would require \( f(k) \geq f(l + 1) \geq f(l) + 1 = k + 1 \), which contradicts \( f(k) = l &lt; k \). Therefore, the only possibility is that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Therefore, the identity function is the only strictly increasing involution on \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \). Since our function \( f \) must be a strictly increasing bijection (as established earlier), and also an involution, the only solution is the identity function. Therefore, \( f(m) = m \) for all \( m \).

But let me just check again to make sure I haven&#x27;t missed any other possibilities. Suppose someone suggests another function, like \( f(m) = m + c \) for some constant \( c \). Let&#x27;s test this. Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + c + n + c) = (m + n + 2c) + c = m + n + 3c \). But this must equal \( m + n \), so \( 3c = 0 \), which implies \( c = 0 \). So that brings us back to the identity function.

Another thought: maybe a function that rearranges numbers in some way but still satisfies the condition. For example, suppose \( f(0) = 0 \), \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 1 \), and \( f(k) = k \) for \( k \geq 3 \). Let&#x27;s test this. Take \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \). Then \( f(f(1) + f(1)) = f(2 + 2) = f(4) = 4 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), so 4 ≠ 2. Therefore, this function doesn&#x27;t work. So swapping 1 and 2 causes a problem. Similarly, any swap would cause inconsistencies when the swapped numbers are used in the function&#x27;s arguments.

Alternatively, suppose we have a more complex permutation. But given the condition \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), it&#x27;s challenging to see how a non-identity permutation would satisfy this. For instance, let&#x27;s suppose that \( f(1) = a \), \( f(a) = 1 \). Then, taking \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(a + a) = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \). Then, applying \( f \) again, \( f(2) = 2a \). But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 0 \), we have \( f(2a + 0) = 2 + 0 = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \), which is consistent with the previous result. But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 2 \), we get \( f(2a + 2a) = f(4a) = 4 \). So \( f(4a) = 4 \), which implies \( f(4) = 4a \). Continuing this pattern, we see that if we set \( f(1) = a \), then \( f(2a) = 2 \), \( f(4a) = 4 \), etc. But since \( a \) must be a positive integer (as \( f \) maps to non-negative integers and is a bijection), if \( a &gt; 1 \), then \( 2a &gt; 2 \), so \( f(2a) = 2 \), but then \( f(2) = 2a \), which is greater than 2. But this would disrupt the strictly increasing nature of \( f \). For example, if \( a = 2 \), then \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 4 \), but then \( f(2) = 4 \) which is greater than \( f(3) \) must be 3 (if we follow the identity for other numbers). But that contradicts the strictly increasing requirement because 2 &lt; 3 but \( f(2) = 4 &gt; f(3) = 3 \). Hence, such a function cannot be increasing. Therefore, \( a \) must be 1, leading back to the identity function.

Another angle: suppose the function has some periodic behavior. For example, maybe even numbers are mapped to one sequence and odd numbers to another. But considering the bijectivity and the strictly increasing nature, it&#x27;s unclear how this could work without violating the functional equation. Let&#x27;s attempt a simple case. Suppose \( f(k) = k + 1 \) for even \( k \) and \( f(k) = k - 1 \) for odd \( k \). This swaps even and odd numbers. Let&#x27;s check \( f(f(m) + f(n)) \). Take \( m = 1 \) (odd), so \( f(1) = 0 \). \( n = 1 \), so \( f(1) = 0 \). Then \( f(0 + 0) = f(0) = 1 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), which is not equal to 1. So that doesn&#x27;t work. Another example: if \( f(k) = k + 2 \) for some \( k \), but then injectivity is lost unless it&#x27;s carefully constructed, which seems difficult.

Alternatively, maybe \( f(k) = c - k \) for some constant \( c \). But since the domain is non-negative integers, this would require \( c \geq k \) for all \( k \), which is impossible unless \( c \) is infinity, which isn&#x27;t a number. So that approach doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, but since \( f \) is an involution, another thought: if \( f \) is additive, meaning \( f(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \), but combined with the involution property. However, the given condition is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), which is different from additivity. If \( f \) were additive, then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(f(m)) + f(f(n)) = m + n \), which actually matches the given condition. So if \( f \) is additive and an involution, then it satisfies the equation. However, the only additive function on non-negative integers is linear, i.e., \( f(k) = ak \) for some constant \( a \). But given that \( f \) maps non-negative integers to non-negative integers and is bijective, \( a \) must be 1. Let&#x27;s verify:

Suppose \( f(k) = ak \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = a(a m + a n) = a^2(m + n) \). For this to equal \( m + n \), we need \( a^2 = 1 \), so \( a = 1 \), since \( a \) must be positive. Therefore, the only additive solution is the identity function. Therefore, even considering additive functions doesn&#x27;t give us any new solutions.

So far, all the lines of thought lead back to the identity function as the only solution. But to be thorough, let&#x27;s try to formally prove that \( f(m) = m \) is the only solution.

We already established that \( f \) is a bijection, strictly increasing, and an involution (i.e., \( f(f(k)) = k \) for all \( k \)). Let&#x27;s use induction to prove that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Base case: \( k = 0 \). We already showed \( f(0) = 0 \).

Inductive step: Assume that for all \( j &lt; k \), \( f(j) = j \). We need to show that \( f(k) = k \).

Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) &gt; f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Therefore, \( f(k) \geq k \) (because it has to be greater than all previous values, which are exactly 0, 1, ..., k-1). Suppose for contradiction that \( f(k) &gt; k \). Let \( f(k) = k + t \) where \( t \geq 1 \).

But since \( f \) is a bijection, there must be some \( m \) such that \( f(m) = k \). Because \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( m \) must be greater than or equal to \( k \) (since \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), so the pre-image of \( k \) must be less than \( k \), but wait, \( f \) is strictly increasing, so if \( f(m) = k \), then \( m \) must satisfy \( f(m) = k \). But since \( f \) is strictly increasing and \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), all values \( f(0), f(1), ..., f(k) \) are 0, 1, ..., k - 1, k + t. Therefore, the value \( k \) must be achieved by some \( m &lt; k \), but by the induction hypothesis, for \( m &lt; k \), \( f(m) = m \). Therefore, the only way \( f(m) = k \) is if \( m = k \), but this contradicts the induction hypothesis because \( m &lt; k \) would imply \( f(m) = m \neq k \). Therefore, there is a contradiction, meaning our assumption that \( f(k) &gt; k \) is false. Therefore, \( f(k) = k \).

Therefore, by induction, \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \).

Hence, the only function that satisfies the given condition is the identity function.

**Final Answer**
The only such function is the identity function, so the answer is \boxed{f(n) = n}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), we start by analyzing the given functional equation.

1. **Injectivity and Surjectivity**:
   - **Injectivity**: Suppose \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \) implies \( m + a = m + b \), so \( a = b \). Thus, \( f \) is injective.
   - **Surjectivity**: For any \( k \), setting \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \) gives \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k \). Let \( c = f(k) + f(0) \), then \( f(c) = k \). Thus, \( f \) is surjective.

2. **Bijectivity and Involution**:
   - Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it is bijective.
   - Setting \( m = 0 \) in the functional equation gives \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = n \). Knowing \( f(0) = 0 \) (from testing \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \)), we get \( f(f(n)) = n \). Thus, \( f \) is an involution.

3. **Strictly Increasing Nature**:
   - \( f \) must be strictly increasing. If not, there would be contradictions in the ordering of non-negative integers.

4. **Inductive Proof**:
   - **Base Case**: \( f(0) = 0 \).
   - **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) \geq k \). Suppose \( f(k) &gt; k \), then there must be some \( m &lt; k \) such that \( f(m) = k \), which contradicts the induction hypothesis. Hence, \( f(k) = k \).

Thus, the only function satisfying the given condition is the identity function. The final answer is \(\boxed{f(n) = n}\).          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), the equation \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) holds. Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall that \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) means the set of all non-negative integers, which includes 0, 1, 2, and so on. So the function \( f \) takes non-negative integers and maps them to non-negative integers. The condition given is that if I take two numbers \( m \) and \( n \), apply \( f \) to each of them, add the results together, and then apply \( f \) again, I should get \( m + n \). Interesting. So \( f \) composed with addition somehow inverts the process?

Maybe I should start by checking if there are any simple functions that satisfy this. The first one that comes to mind is the identity function, where \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let&#x27;s test that:

If \( f(k) = k \), then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + n) = m + n \), which matches the given condition. So the identity function works. But the problem says &quot;find all functions,&quot; so there might be others, or maybe the identity is the only solution.

But before jumping to conclusions, let&#x27;s see if there are other possibilities. Sometimes functions can be involutions, meaning that applying them twice gives the identity. But in this case, the functional equation isn&#x27;t exactly an involution; it&#x27;s more like a nested function. Let&#x27;s try to analyze the properties that such a function \( f \) must have.

First, is \( f \) injective? Suppose that \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then, for any \( m \), consider \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \). By the given equation, this implies \( m + a = m + b \), which would mean \( a = b \). Therefore, \( f \) is injective.

Okay, so injectivity is established. What about surjectivity? Let&#x27;s see. For any non-negative integer \( k \), we need to find some \( c \) such that \( f(c) = k \). Let&#x27;s pick an arbitrary \( k \). Suppose we set \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \). Then the equation becomes \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k + 0 = k \). Let&#x27;s denote \( c = f(k) + f(0) \). Then \( f(c) = k \). Therefore, for any \( k \), there exists such a \( c \), so \( f \) is surjective.

Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it&#x27;s bijective. That&#x27;s a good start. Bijections have well-defined inverse functions, but since we&#x27;re dealing with non-negative integers, the inverse might not necessarily be a function unless we&#x27;re careful. However, knowing that \( f \) is bijective can help us manipulate the equation.

Let me think. Since \( f \) is bijective, maybe we can express \( f(m) + f(n) \) in terms of the inverse function. Wait, but the equation given is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \). If I denote \( f(m) + f(n) \) as some input to \( f \), which outputs \( m + n \). If \( f \) is invertible, then \( f^{-1}(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \). But wait, inverses of functions on integers can be tricky because they might not exist unless the function is strictly increasing or decreasing. But since \( f \) is bijective, it must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing? Hmm, but in non-negative integers, strictly decreasing would eventually hit zero and negative numbers, which aren&#x27;t allowed. So \( f \) must be strictly increasing.

Therefore, \( f \) is a strictly increasing bijection. That&#x27;s helpful. So, for example, \( f(0) \) is the minimal value of \( f \), which must be 0 or some other number. Wait, but since \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and it&#x27;s a bijection, \( f(0) \) must be 0. Wait, let&#x27;s check that.

If \( f \) is a bijection from \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) to \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \), then it must map 0 to some number. Suppose \( f(0) = a \). Since it&#x27;s a bijection, \( a \) must be unique. Let&#x27;s plug \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \) into the original equation: \( f(f(0) + f(0)) = 0 + 0 = 0 \). So \( f(2a) = 0 \). But \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and since it&#x27;s injective, the only way \( f(2a) = 0 \) is if \( 2a \) is mapped uniquely. But if \( a = f(0) \), then \( a \) must be 0 because otherwise, \( 0 \) would be mapped to by \( 2a \), but \( a \) is already mapped to by 0, and since \( f \) is injective, \( 2a \) can&#x27;t also map to 0 unless \( 2a = a \), which would imply \( a = 0 \). Therefore, \( f(0) = 0 \).

Okay, so \( f(0) = 0 \). That&#x27;s a useful piece of information. Let&#x27;s note that down. So plugging \( m = 0 \) into the original equation gives us \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = 0 + n = n \). Since \( f(0) = 0 \), this simplifies to \( f(f(n)) = n \). Wait, so \( f \) is an involution, meaning that applying it twice gives the identity function. That is, \( f(f(n)) = n \) for all \( n \). That&#x27;s a key property.

So \( f \) is a bijective involution. Therefore, \( f \) is its own inverse. That&#x27;s a crucial observation. So if \( f(k) = l \), then \( f(l) = k \). This is because \( f(f(k)) = k \), so \( f(l) = k \). Therefore, the function pairs numbers in such a way that each pair \( (k, l) \) satisfies \( f(k) = l \) and \( f(l) = k \). However, if \( k = l \), then \( f(k) = k \), so fixed points are allowed. So \( f \) could be a permutation composed of transpositions (swaps of pairs) and fixed points.

But given that the function is strictly increasing (as we concluded earlier because decreasing would lead to contradictions in non-negative integers), then such transpositions would have to be arranged in a way that preserves the increasing order. But transpositions would require swapping elements, which might disrupt the increasing order. For example, if we swap 1 and 2, then \( f(1) = 2 \) and \( f(2) = 1 \), but then \( f(1) = 2 &gt; f(2) = 1 \), which contradicts the strictly increasing nature. Therefore, the only way for \( f \) to be a strictly increasing involution is if it is the identity function. Because any swap would violate the strictly increasing condition.

Therefore, if \( f \) is strictly increasing and an involution, then \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let me verify this. Suppose there exists some \( k \) such that \( f(k) \neq k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, either \( f(k) &gt; k \) or \( f(k) &lt; k \). Suppose \( f(k) = l &gt; k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \). But \( f(l) = k \) because \( f \) is an involution. However, \( k &lt; l \), so \( f(l) = k &lt; l \), but since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \geq f(k) + 1 = l + 1 \), which leads to a contradiction because \( k &lt; l \) and \( f(l) = k \geq l + 1 \) is impossible. Similarly, if \( f(k) = l &lt; k \), then \( f(l) = k \), but since \( l &lt; k \), \( f(l) = k &gt; l \), which again would require \( f(k) \geq f(l + 1) \geq f(l) + 1 = k + 1 \), which contradicts \( f(k) = l &lt; k \). Therefore, the only possibility is that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Therefore, the identity function is the only strictly increasing involution on \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \). Since our function \( f \) must be a strictly increasing bijection (as established earlier), and also an involution, the only solution is the identity function. Therefore, \( f(m) = m \) for all \( m \).

But let me just check again to make sure I haven&#x27;t missed any other possibilities. Suppose someone suggests another function, like \( f(m) = m + c \) for some constant \( c \). Let&#x27;s test this. Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + c + n + c) = (m + n + 2c) + c = m + n + 3c \). But this must equal \( m + n \), so \( 3c = 0 \), which implies \( c = 0 \). So that brings us back to the identity function.

Another thought: maybe a function that rearranges numbers in some way but still satisfies the condition. For example, suppose \( f(0) = 0 \), \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 1 \), and \( f(k) = k \) for \( k \geq 3 \). Let&#x27;s test this. Take \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \). Then \( f(f(1) + f(1)) = f(2 + 2) = f(4) = 4 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), so 4 ≠ 2. Therefore, this function doesn&#x27;t work. So swapping 1 and 2 causes a problem. Similarly, any swap would cause inconsistencies when the swapped numbers are used in the function&#x27;s arguments.

Alternatively, suppose we have a more complex permutation. But given the condition \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), it&#x27;s challenging to see how a non-identity permutation would satisfy this. For instance, let&#x27;s suppose that \( f(1) = a \), \( f(a) = 1 \). Then, taking \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(a + a) = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \). Then, applying \( f \) again, \( f(2) = 2a \). But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 0 \), we have \( f(2a + 0) = 2 + 0 = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \), which is consistent with the previous result. But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 2 \), we get \( f(2a + 2a) = f(4a) = 4 \). So \( f(4a) = 4 \), which implies \( f(4) = 4a \). Continuing this pattern, we see that if we set \( f(1) = a \), then \( f(2a) = 2 \), \( f(4a) = 4 \), etc. But since \( a \) must be a positive integer (as \( f \) maps to non-negative integers and is a bijection), if \( a &gt; 1 \), then \( 2a &gt; 2 \), so \( f(2a) = 2 \), but then \( f(2) = 2a \), which is greater than 2. But this would disrupt the strictly increasing nature of \( f \). For example, if \( a = 2 \), then \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 4 \), but then \( f(2) = 4 \) which is greater than \( f(3) \) must be 3 (if we follow the identity for other numbers). But that contradicts the strictly increasing requirement because 2 &lt; 3 but \( f(2) = 4 &gt; f(3) = 3 \). Hence, such a function cannot be increasing. Therefore, \( a \) must be 1, leading back to the identity function.

Another angle: suppose the function has some periodic behavior. For example, maybe even numbers are mapped to one sequence and odd numbers to another. But considering the bijectivity and the strictly increasing nature, it&#x27;s unclear how this could work without violating the functional equation. Let&#x27;s attempt a simple case. Suppose \( f(k) = k + 1 \) for even \( k \) and \( f(k) = k - 1 \) for odd \( k \). This swaps even and odd numbers. Let&#x27;s check \( f(f(m) + f(n)) \). Take \( m = 1 \) (odd), so \( f(1) = 0 \). \( n = 1 \), so \( f(1) = 0 \). Then \( f(0 + 0) = f(0) = 1 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), which is not equal to 1. So that doesn&#x27;t work. Another example: if \( f(k) = k + 2 \) for some \( k \), but then injectivity is lost unless it&#x27;s carefully constructed, which seems difficult.

Alternatively, maybe \( f(k) = c - k \) for some constant \( c \). But since the domain is non-negative integers, this would require \( c \geq k \) for all \( k \), which is impossible unless \( c \) is infinity, which isn&#x27;t a number. So that approach doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, but since \( f \) is an involution, another thought: if \( f \) is additive, meaning \( f(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \), but combined with the involution property. However, the given condition is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), which is different from additivity. If \( f \) were additive, then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(f(m)) + f(f(n)) = m + n \), which actually matches the given condition. So if \( f \) is additive and an involution, then it satisfies the equation. However, the only additive function on non-negative integers is linear, i.e., \( f(k) = ak \) for some constant \( a \). But given that \( f \) maps non-negative integers to non-negative integers and is bijective, \( a \) must be 1. Let&#x27;s verify:

Suppose \( f(k) = ak \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = a(a m + a n) = a^2(m + n) \). For this to equal \( m + n \), we need \( a^2 = 1 \), so \( a = 1 \), since \( a \) must be positive. Therefore, the only additive solution is the identity function. Therefore, even considering additive functions doesn&#x27;t give us any new solutions.

So far, all the lines of thought lead back to the identity function as the only solution. But to be thorough, let&#x27;s try to formally prove that \( f(m) = m \) is the only solution.

We already established that \( f \) is a bijection, strictly increasing, and an involution (i.e., \( f(f(k)) = k \) for all \( k \)). Let&#x27;s use induction to prove that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Base case: \( k = 0 \). We already showed \( f(0) = 0 \).

Inductive step: Assume that for all \( j &lt; k \), \( f(j) = j \). We need to show that \( f(k) = k \).

Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) &gt; f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Therefore, \( f(k) \geq k \) (because it has to be greater than all previous values, which are exactly 0, 1, ..., k-1). Suppose for contradiction that \( f(k) &gt; k \). Let \( f(k) = k + t \) where \( t \geq 1 \).

But since \( f \) is a bijection, there must be some \( m \) such that \( f(m) = k \). Because \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( m \) must be greater than or equal to \( k \) (since \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), so the pre-image of \( k \) must be less than \( k \), but wait, \( f \) is strictly increasing, so if \( f(m) = k \), then \( m \) must satisfy \( f(m) = k \). But since \( f \) is strictly increasing and \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), all values \( f(0), f(1), ..., f(k) \) are 0, 1, ..., k - 1, k + t. Therefore, the value \( k \) must be achieved by some \( m &lt; k \), but by the induction hypothesis, for \( m &lt; k \), \( f(m) = m \). Therefore, the only way \( f(m) = k \) is if \( m = k \), but this contradicts the induction hypothesis because \( m &lt; k \) would imply \( f(m) = m \neq k \). Therefore, there is a contradiction, meaning our assumption that \( f(k) &gt; k \) is false. Therefore, \( f(k) = k \).

Therefore, by induction, \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \).

Hence, the only function that satisfies the given condition is the identity function.

**Final Answer**
The only such function is the identity function, so the answer is \boxed{f(n) = n}.

To find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), we start by analyzing the given functional equation.

   - **Surjectivity**: For any \( k \), setting \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \) gives \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k \). Let \( c = f(k) + f(0) \), then \( f(c) = k \). Thus, \( f \) is surjective.

2. **Bijectivity and Involution**:
   - Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it is bijective.
   - Setting \( m = 0 \) in the functional equation gives \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = n \). Knowing \( f(0) = 0 \) (from testing \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \)), we get \( f(f(n)) = n \). Thus, \( f \) is an involution.

3. **Strictly Increasing Nature**:
   - \( f \) must be strictly increasing. If not, there would be contradictions in the ordering of non-negative integers.

4. **Inductive Proof**:
   - **Base Case**: \( f(0) = 0 \).
   - **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) \geq k \). Suppose \( f(k) &gt; k \), then there must be some \( m &lt; k \) such that \( f(m) = k \), which contradicts the induction hypothesis. Hence, \( f(k) = k \).

Thus, the only function satisfying the given condition is the identity function. The final answer is \(\boxed{f(n) = n}\).          </p>

The condition given is that if I take two numbers \( m \) and \( n \), apply \( f \) to each of them, add the results together, and then apply \( f \) again, I should get \( m + n \). Interesting. So \( f \) composed with addition somehow inverts the process?

Maybe I should start by checking if there are any simple functions that satisfy this. The first one that comes to mind is the identity function, where \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let&#x27;s test that:

If \( f(k) = k \), then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + n) = m + n \), which matches the given condition. So the identity function works. But the problem says &quot;find all functions,&quot; so there might be others, or maybe the identity is the only solution.

But before jumping to conclusions, let&#x27;s see if there are other possibilities. Sometimes functions can be involutions, meaning that applying them twice gives the identity. But in this case, the functional equation isn&#x27;t exactly an involution; it&#x27;s more like a nested function. Let&#x27;s try to analyze the properties that such a function \( f \) must have.

First, is \( f \) injective? Suppose that \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then, for any \( m \), consider \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \). By the given equation, this implies \( m + a = m + b \), which would mean \( a = b \). Therefore, \( f \) is injective.

Okay, so injectivity is established. What about surjectivity? Let&#x27;s see. For any non-negative integer \( k \), we need to find some \( c \) such that \( f(c) = k \). Let&#x27;s pick an arbitrary \( k \). Suppose we set \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \). Then the equation becomes \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k + 0 = k \). Let&#x27;s denote \( c = f(k) + f(0) \). Then \( f(c) = k \). Therefore, for any \( k \), there exists such a \( c \), so \( f \) is surjective.

Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it&#x27;s bijective. That&#x27;s a good start. Bijections have well-defined inverse functions, but since we&#x27;re dealing with non-negative integers, the inverse might not necessarily be a function unless we&#x27;re careful. However, knowing that \( f \) is bijective can help us manipulate the equation.

Let me think. Since \( f \) is bijective, maybe we can express \( f(m) + f(n) \) in terms of the inverse function. Wait, but the equation given is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \). If I denote \( f(m) + f(n) \) as some input to \( f \), which outputs \( m + n \). If \( f \) is invertible, then \( f^{-1}(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \). But wait, inverses of functions on integers can be tricky because they might not exist unless the function is strictly increasing or decreasing. But since \( f \) is bijective, it must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing? Hmm, but in non-negative integers, strictly decreasing would eventually hit zero and negative numbers, which aren&#x27;t allowed. So \( f \) must be strictly increasing.

Therefore, \( f \) is a strictly increasing bijection. That&#x27;s helpful. So, for example, \( f(0) \) is the minimal value of \( f \), which must be 0 or some other number. Wait, but since \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and it&#x27;s a bijection, \( f(0) \) must be 0. Wait, let&#x27;s check that.

If \( f \) is a bijection from \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) to \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \), then it must map 0 to some number. Suppose \( f(0) = a \). Since it&#x27;s a bijection, \( a \) must be unique. Let&#x27;s plug \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \) into the original equation: \( f(f(0) + f(0)) = 0 + 0 = 0 \). So \( f(2a) = 0 \). But \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and since it&#x27;s injective, the only way \( f(2a) = 0 \) is if \( 2a \) is mapped uniquely. But if \( a = f(0) \), then \( a \) must be 0 because otherwise, \( 0 \) would be mapped to by \( 2a \), but \( a \) is already mapped to by 0, and since \( f \) is injective, \( 2a \) can&#x27;t also map to 0 unless \( 2a = a \), which would imply \( a = 0 \). Therefore, \( f(0) = 0 \).

Okay, so \( f(0) = 0 \). That&#x27;s a useful piece of information. Let&#x27;s note that down. So plugging \( m = 0 \) into the original equation gives us \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = 0 + n = n \). Since \( f(0) = 0 \), this simplifies to \( f(f(n)) = n \). Wait, so \( f \) is an involution, meaning that applying it twice gives the identity function. That is, \( f(f(n)) = n \) for all \( n \). That&#x27;s a key property.

So \( f \) is a bijective involution. Therefore, \( f \) is its own inverse. That&#x27;s a crucial observation. So if \( f(k) = l \), then \( f(l) = k \). This is because \( f(f(k)) = k \), so \( f(l) = k \). Therefore, the function pairs numbers in such a way that each pair \( (k, l) \) satisfies \( f(k) = l \) and \( f(l) = k \). However, if \( k = l \), then \( f(k) = k \), so fixed points are allowed. So \( f \) could be a permutation composed of transpositions (swaps of pairs) and fixed points.

But given that the function is strictly increasing (as we concluded earlier because decreasing would lead to contradictions in non-negative integers), then such transpositions would have to be arranged in a way that preserves the increasing order. But transpositions would require swapping elements, which might disrupt the increasing order. For example, if we swap 1 and 2, then \( f(1) = 2 \) and \( f(2) = 1 \), but then \( f(1) = 2 &gt; f(2) = 1 \), which contradicts the strictly increasing nature. Therefore, the only way for \( f \) to be a strictly increasing involution is if it is the identity function. Because any swap would violate the strictly increasing condition.

Therefore, if \( f \) is strictly increasing and an involution, then \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let me verify this. Suppose there exists some \( k \) such that \( f(k) \neq k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, either \( f(k) &gt; k \) or \( f(k) &lt; k \). Suppose \( f(k) = l &gt; k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \). But \( f(l) = k \) because \( f \) is an involution. However, \( k &lt; l \), so \( f(l) = k &lt; l \), but since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \geq f(k) + 1 = l + 1 \), which leads to a contradiction because \( k &lt; l \) and \( f(l) = k \geq l + 1 \) is impossible. Similarly, if \( f(k) = l &lt; k \), then \( f(l) = k \), but since \( l &lt; k \), \( f(l) = k &gt; l \), which again would require \( f(k) \geq f(l + 1) \geq f(l) + 1 = k + 1 \), which contradicts \( f(k) = l &lt; k \). Therefore, the only possibility is that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Therefore, the identity function is the only strictly increasing involution on \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \). Since our function \( f \) must be a strictly increasing bijection (as established earlier), and also an involution, the only solution is the identity function. Therefore, \( f(m) = m \) for all \( m \).

But let me just check again to make sure I haven&#x27;t missed any other possibilities. Suppose someone suggests another function, like \( f(m) = m + c \) for some constant \( c \). Let&#x27;s test this. Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + c + n + c) = (m + n + 2c) + c = m + n + 3c \). But this must equal \( m + n \), so \( 3c = 0 \), which implies \( c = 0 \). So that brings us back to the identity function.

Another thought: maybe a function that rearranges numbers in some way but still satisfies the condition. For example, suppose \( f(0) = 0 \), \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 1 \), and \( f(k) = k \) for \( k \geq 3 \). Let&#x27;s test this. Take \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \). Then \( f(f(1) + f(1)) = f(2 + 2) = f(4) = 4 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), so 4 ≠ 2. Therefore, this function doesn&#x27;t work. So swapping 1 and 2 causes a problem. Similarly, any swap would cause inconsistencies when the swapped numbers are used in the function&#x27;s arguments.

Alternatively, suppose we have a more complex permutation. But given the condition \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), it&#x27;s challenging to see how a non-identity permutation would satisfy this. For instance, let&#x27;s suppose that \( f(1) = a \), \( f(a) = 1 \). Then, taking \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(a + a) = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \). Then, applying \( f \) again, \( f(2) = 2a \). But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 0 \), we have \( f(2a + 0) = 2 + 0 = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \), which is consistent with the previous result. But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 2 \), we get \( f(2a + 2a) = f(4a) = 4 \). So \( f(4a) = 4 \), which implies \( f(4) = 4a \). Continuing this pattern, we see that if we set \( f(1) = a \), then \( f(2a) = 2 \), \( f(4a) = 4 \), etc. But since \( a \) must be a positive integer (as \( f \) maps to non-negative integers and is a bijection), if \( a &gt; 1 \), then \( 2a &gt; 2 \), so \( f(2a) = 2 \), but then \( f(2) = 2a \), which is greater than 2. But this would disrupt the strictly increasing nature of \( f \). For example, if \( a = 2 \), then \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 4 \), but then \( f(2) = 4 \) which is greater than \( f(3) \) must be 3 (if we follow the identity for other numbers). But that contradicts the strictly increasing requirement because 2 &lt; 3 but \( f(2) = 4 &gt; f(3) = 3 \). Hence, such a function cannot be increasing. Therefore, \( a \) must be 1, leading back to the identity function.

Another angle: suppose the function has some periodic behavior. For example, maybe even numbers are mapped to one sequence and odd numbers to another. But considering the bijectivity and the strictly increasing nature, it&#x27;s unclear how this could work without violating the functional equation. Let&#x27;s attempt a simple case. Suppose \( f(k) = k + 1 \) for even \( k \) and \( f(k) = k - 1 \) for odd \( k \). This swaps even and odd numbers. Let&#x27;s check \( f(f(m) + f(n)) \). Take \( m = 1 \) (odd), so \( f(1) = 0 \). \( n = 1 \), so \( f(1) = 0 \). Then \( f(0 + 0) = f(0) = 1 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), which is not equal to 1. So that doesn&#x27;t work. Another example: if \( f(k) = k + 2 \) for some \( k \), but then injectivity is lost unless it&#x27;s carefully constructed, which seems difficult.

Alternatively, maybe \( f(k) = c - k \) for some constant \( c \). But since the domain is non-negative integers, this would require \( c \geq k \) for all \( k \), which is impossible unless \( c \) is infinity, which isn&#x27;t a number. So that approach doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, but since \( f \) is an involution, another thought: if \( f \) is additive, meaning \( f(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \), but combined with the involution property. However, the given condition is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), which is different from additivity. If \( f \) were additive, then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(f(m)) + f(f(n)) = m + n \), which actually matches the given condition. So if \( f \) is additive and an involution, then it satisfies the equation. However, the only additive function on non-negative integers is linear, i.e., \( f(k) = ak \) for some constant \( a \). But given that \( f \) maps non-negative integers to non-negative integers and is bijective, \( a \) must be 1. Let&#x27;s verify:

Suppose \( f(k) = ak \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = a(a m + a n) = a^2(m + n) \). For this to equal \( m + n \), we need \( a^2 = 1 \), so \( a = 1 \), since \( a \) must be positive. Therefore, the only additive solution is the identity function. Therefore, even considering additive functions doesn&#x27;t give us any new solutions.

So far, all the lines of thought lead back to the identity function as the only solution. But to be thorough, let&#x27;s try to formally prove that \( f(m) = m \) is the only solution.

We already established that \( f \) is a bijection, strictly increasing, and an involution (i.e., \( f(f(k)) = k \) for all \( k \)). Let&#x27;s use induction to prove that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Base case: \( k = 0 \). We already showed \( f(0) = 0 \).

Inductive step: Assume that for all \( j &lt; k \), \( f(j) = j \). We need to show that \( f(k) = k \).

Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) &gt; f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Therefore, \( f(k) \geq k \) (because it has to be greater than all previous values, which are exactly 0, 1, ..., k-1). Suppose for contradiction that \( f(k) &gt; k \). Let \( f(k) = k + t \) where \( t \geq 1 \).

But since \( f \) is a bijection, there must be some \( m \) such that \( f(m) = k \). Because \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( m \) must be greater than or equal to \( k \) (since \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), so the pre-image of \( k \) must be less than \( k \), but wait, \( f \) is strictly increasing, so if \( f(m) = k \), then \( m \) must satisfy \( f(m) = k \). But since \( f \) is strictly increasing and \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), all values \( f(0), f(1), ..., f(k) \) are 0, 1, ..., k - 1, k + t. Therefore, the value \( k \) must be achieved by some \( m &lt; k \), but by the induction hypothesis, for \( m &lt; k \), \( f(m) = m \). Therefore, the only way \( f(m) = k \) is if \( m = k \), but this contradicts the induction hypothesis because \( m &lt; k \) would imply \( f(m) = m \neq k \). Therefore, there is a contradiction, meaning our assumption that \( f(k) &gt; k \) is false. Therefore, \( f(k) = k \).

Therefore, by induction, \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \).

Hence, the only function that satisfies the given condition is the identity function.

**Final Answer**
The only such function is the identity function, so the answer is \boxed{f(n) = n}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), we start by analyzing the given functional equation.

1. **Injectivity and Surjectivity**:
   - **Injectivity**: Suppose \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \) implies \( m + a = m + b \), so \( a = b \). Thus, \( f \) is injective.
   - **Surjectivity**: For any \( k \), setting \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \) gives \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k \). Let \( c = f(k) + f(0) \), then \( f(c) = k \). Thus, \( f \) is surjective.

2. **Bijectivity and Involution**:
   - Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it is bijective.
   - Setting \( m = 0 \) in the functional equation gives \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = n \). Knowing \( f(0) = 0 \) (from testing \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \)), we get \( f(f(n)) = n \). Thus, \( f \) is an involution.

3. **Strictly Increasing Nature**:
   - \( f \) must be strictly increasing. If not, there would be contradictions in the ordering of non-negative integers.

4. **Inductive Proof**:
   - **Base Case**: \( f(0) = 0 \).
   - **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) \geq k \). Suppose \( f(k) &gt; k \), then there must be some \( m &lt; k \) such that \( f(m) = k \), which contradicts the induction hypothesis. Hence, \( f(k) = k \).

Thus, the only function satisfying the given condition is the identity function. The final answer is \(\boxed{f(n) = n}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), the equation \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) holds. Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall that \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) means the set of all non-negative integers, which includes 0, 1, 2, and so on. So the function \( f \) takes non-negative integers and maps them to non-negative integers.

Wait, but since \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and it&#x27;s a bijection, \( f(0) \) must be 0. Wait, let&#x27;s check that.

If \( f \) is a bijection from \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) to \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \), then it must map 0 to some number. Suppose \( f(0) = a \). Since it&#x27;s a bijection, \( a \) must be unique. Let&#x27;s plug \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \) into the original equation: \( f(f(0) + f(0)) = 0 + 0 = 0 \). So \( f(2a) = 0 \). But \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and since it&#x27;s injective, the only way \( f(2a) = 0 \) is if \( 2a \) is mapped uniquely. But if \( a = f(0) \), then \( a \) must be 0 because otherwise, \( 0 \) would be mapped to by \( 2a \), but \( a \) is already mapped to by 0, and since \( f \) is injective, \( 2a \) can&#x27;t also map to 0 unless \( 2a = a \), which would imply \( a = 0 \).

Okay, so \( f(0) = 0 \). That&#x27;s a useful piece of information. Let&#x27;s note that down. So plugging \( m = 0 \) into the original equation gives us \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = 0 + n = n \).

But transpositions would require swapping elements, which might disrupt the increasing order. For example, if we swap 1 and 2, then \( f(1) = 2 \) and \( f(2) = 1 \), but then \( f(1) = 2 &gt; f(2) = 1 \), which contradicts the strictly increasing nature. Therefore, the only way for \( f \) to be a strictly increasing involution is if it is the identity function. Because any swap would violate the strictly increasing condition.

Therefore, if \( f \) is strictly increasing and an involution, then \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let me verify this. Suppose there exists some \( k \) such that \( f(k) \neq k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, either \( f(k) &gt; k \) or \( f(k) &lt; k \). Suppose \( f(k) = l &gt; k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \). But \( f(l) = k \) because \( f \) is an involution. However, \( k &lt; l \), so \( f(l) = k &lt; l \), but since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \geq f(k) + 1 = l + 1 \), which leads to a contradiction because \( k &lt; l \) and \( f(l) = k \geq l + 1 \) is impossible. Similarly, if \( f(k) = l &lt; k \), then \( f(l) = k \), but since \( l &lt; k \), \( f(l) = k &gt; l \), which again would require \( f(k) \geq f(l + 1) \geq f(l) + 1 = k + 1 \), which contradicts \( f(k) = l &lt; k \). Therefore, the only possibility is that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Therefore, the identity function is the only strictly increasing involution on \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \). Since our function \( f \) must be a strictly increasing bijection (as established earlier), and also an involution, the only solution is the identity function. Therefore, \( f(m) = m \) for all \( m \).

But let me just check again to make sure I haven&#x27;t missed any other possibilities. Suppose someone suggests another function, like \( f(m) = m + c \) for some constant \( c \). Let&#x27;s test this. Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + c + n + c) = (m + n + 2c) + c = m + n + 3c \). But this must equal \( m + n \), so \( 3c = 0 \), which implies \( c = 0 \). So that brings us back to the identity function.

Another thought: maybe a function that rearranges numbers in some way but still satisfies the condition. For example, suppose \( f(0) = 0 \), \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 1 \), and \( f(k) = k \) for \( k \geq 3 \). Let&#x27;s test this. Take \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \). Then \( f(f(1) + f(1)) = f(2 + 2) = f(4) = 4 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), so 4 ≠ 2. Therefore, this function doesn&#x27;t work. So swapping 1 and 2 causes a problem. Similarly, any swap would cause inconsistencies when the swapped numbers are used in the function&#x27;s arguments.

Alternatively, suppose we have a more complex permutation. But given the condition \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), it&#x27;s challenging to see how a non-identity permutation would satisfy this. For instance, let&#x27;s suppose that \( f(1) = a \), \( f(a) = 1 \). Then, taking \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(a + a) = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \). Then, applying \( f \) again, \( f(2) = 2a \). But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 0 \), we have \( f(2a + 0) = 2 + 0 = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \), which is consistent with the previous result. But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 2 \), we get \( f(2a + 2a) = f(4a) = 4 \). So \( f(4a) = 4 \), which implies \( f(4) = 4a \). Continuing this pattern, we see that if we set \( f(1) = a \), then \( f(2a) = 2 \), \( f(4a) = 4 \), etc. But since \( a \) must be a positive integer (as \( f \) maps to non-negative integers and is a bijection), if \( a &gt; 1 \), then \( 2a &gt; 2 \), so \( f(2a) = 2 \), but then \( f(2) = 2a \), which is greater than 2. But this would disrupt the strictly increasing nature of \( f \). For example, if \( a = 2 \), then \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 4 \), but then \( f(2) = 4 \) which is greater than \( f(3) \) must be 3 (if we follow the identity for other numbers). But that contradicts the strictly increasing requirement because 2 &lt; 3 but \( f(2) = 4 &gt; f(3) = 3 \). Hence, such a function cannot be increasing. Therefore, \( a \) must be 1, leading back to the identity function.

Another angle: suppose the function has some periodic behavior. For example, maybe even numbers are mapped to one sequence and odd numbers to another. But considering the bijectivity and the strictly increasing nature, it&#x27;s unclear how this could work without violating the functional equation. Let&#x27;s attempt a simple case. Suppose \( f(k) = k + 1 \) for even \( k \) and \( f(k) = k - 1 \) for odd \( k \). This swaps even and odd numbers. Let&#x27;s check \( f(f(m) + f(n)) \). Take \( m = 1 \) (odd), so \( f(1) = 0 \). \( n = 1 \), so \( f(1) = 0 \). Then \( f(0 + 0) = f(0) = 1 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), which is not equal to 1. So that doesn&#x27;t work. Another example: if \( f(k) = k + 2 \) for some \( k \), but then injectivity is lost unless it&#x27;s carefully constructed, which seems difficult.

Alternatively, maybe \( f(k) = c - k \) for some constant \( c \). But since the domain is non-negative integers, this would require \( c \geq k \) for all \( k \), which is impossible unless \( c \) is infinity, which isn&#x27;t a number. So that approach doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, but since \( f \) is an involution, another thought: if \( f \) is additive, meaning \( f(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \), but combined with the involution property. However, the given condition is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), which is different from additivity. If \( f \) were additive, then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(f(m)) + f(f(n)) = m + n \), which actually matches the given condition. So if \( f \) is additive and an involution, then it satisfies the equation. However, the only additive function on non-negative integers is linear, i.e., \( f(k) = ak \) for some constant \( a \). But given that \( f \) maps non-negative integers to non-negative integers and is bijective, \( a \) must be 1. Let&#x27;s verify:

Suppose \( f(k) = ak \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = a(a m + a n) = a^2(m + n) \). For this to equal \( m + n \), we need \( a^2 = 1 \), so \( a = 1 \), since \( a \) must be positive. Therefore, the only additive solution is the identity function. Therefore, even considering additive functions doesn&#x27;t give us any new solutions.

So far, all the lines of thought lead back to the identity function as the only solution. But to be thorough, let&#x27;s try to formally prove that \( f(m) = m \) is the only solution.

We already established that \( f \) is a bijection, strictly increasing, and an involution (i.e., \( f(f(k)) = k \) for all \( k \)). Let&#x27;s use induction to prove that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Base case: \( k = 0 \). We already showed \( f(0) = 0 \).

Inductive step: Assume that for all \( j &lt; k \), \( f(j) = j \). We need to show that \( f(k) = k \).

Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) &gt; f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Therefore, \( f(k) \geq k \) (because it has to be greater than all previous values, which are exactly 0, 1, ..., k-1). Suppose for contradiction that \( f(k) &gt; k \). Let \( f(k) = k + t \) where \( t \geq 1 \).

But since \( f \) is a bijection, there must be some \( m \) such that \( f(m) = k \). Because \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( m \) must be greater than or equal to \( k \) (since \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), so the pre-image of \( k \) must be less than \( k \), but wait, \( f \) is strictly increasing, so if \( f(m) = k \), then \( m \) must satisfy \( f(m) = k \). But since \( f \) is strictly increasing and \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), all values \( f(0), f(1), ..., f(k) \) are 0, 1, ..., k - 1, k + t. Therefore, the value \( k \) must be achieved by some \( m &lt; k \), but by the induction hypothesis, for \( m &lt; k \), \( f(m) = m \). Therefore, the only way \( f(m) = k \) is if \( m = k \), but this contradicts the induction hypothesis because \( m &lt; k \) would imply \( f(m) = m \neq k \). Therefore, there is a contradiction, meaning our assumption that \( f(k) &gt; k \) is false. Therefore, \( f(k) = k \).

Therefore, by induction, \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \).

Hence, the only function that satisfies the given condition is the identity function.

**Final Answer**
The only such function is the identity function, so the answer is \boxed{f(n) = n}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), we start by analyzing the given functional equation.

1. **Injectivity and Surjectivity**:
   - **Injectivity**: Suppose \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \) implies \( m + a = m + b \), so \( a = b \). Thus, \( f \) is injective.
   - **Surjectivity**: For any \( k \), setting \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \) gives \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k \). Let \( c = f(k) + f(0) \), then \( f(c) = k \). Thus, \( f \) is surjective.

2. **Bijectivity and Involution**:
   - Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it is bijective.
   - Setting \( m = 0 \) in the functional equation gives \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = n \). Knowing \( f(0) = 0 \) (from testing \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \)), we get \( f(f(n)) = n \). Thus, \( f \) is an involution.

3. **Strictly Increasing Nature**:
   - \( f \) must be strictly increasing. If not, there would be contradictions in the ordering of non-negative integers.

4. **Inductive Proof**:
   - **Base Case**: \( f(0) = 0 \).
   - **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) \geq k \). Suppose \( f(k) &gt; k \), then there must be some \( m &lt; k \) such that \( f(m) = k \), which contradicts the induction hypothesis. Hence, \( f(k) = k \).

Thus, the only function satisfying the given condition is the identity function. The final answer is \(\boxed{f(n) = n}\).          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), the equation \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) holds. Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall that \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) means the set of all non-negative integers, which includes 0, 1, 2, and so on. So the function \( f \) takes non-negative integers and maps them to non-negative integers. The condition given is that if I take two numbers \( m \) and \( n \), apply \( f \) to each of them, add the results together, and then apply \( f \) again, I should get \( m + n \). Interesting. So \( f \) composed with addition somehow inverts the process?

Maybe I should start by checking if there are any simple functions that satisfy this. The first one that comes to mind is the identity function, where \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let&#x27;s test that:

If \( f(k) = k \), then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + n) = m + n \), which matches the given condition. So the identity function works. But the problem says &quot;find all functions,&quot; so there might be others, or maybe the identity is the only solution.

But before jumping to conclusions, let&#x27;s see if there are other possibilities. Sometimes functions can be involutions, meaning that applying them twice gives the identity. But in this case, the functional equation isn&#x27;t exactly an involution; it&#x27;s more like a nested function. Let&#x27;s try to analyze the properties that such a function \( f \) must have.

First, is \( f \) injective? Suppose that \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then, for any \( m \), consider \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \). By the given equation, this implies \( m + a = m + b \), which would mean \( a = b \). Therefore, \( f \) is injective.

Okay, so injectivity is established. What about surjectivity? Let&#x27;s see. For any non-negative integer \( k \), we need to find some \( c \) such that \( f(c) = k \). Let&#x27;s pick an arbitrary \( k \). Suppose we set \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \). Then the equation becomes \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k + 0 = k \). Let&#x27;s denote \( c = f(k) + f(0) \). Then \( f(c) = k \). Therefore, for any \( k \), there exists such a \( c \), so \( f \) is surjective.

Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it&#x27;s bijective. That&#x27;s a good start. Bijections have well-defined inverse functions, but since we&#x27;re dealing with non-negative integers, the inverse might not necessarily be a function unless we&#x27;re careful. However, knowing that \( f \) is bijective can help us manipulate the equation.

Let me think. Since \( f \) is bijective, maybe we can express \( f(m) + f(n) \) in terms of the inverse function. Wait, but the equation given is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \). If I denote \( f(m) + f(n) \) as some input to \( f \), which outputs \( m + n \). If \( f \) is invertible, then \( f^{-1}(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \). But wait, inverses of functions on integers can be tricky because they might not exist unless the function is strictly increasing or decreasing. But since \( f \) is bijective, it must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing? Hmm, but in non-negative integers, strictly decreasing would eventually hit zero and negative numbers, which aren&#x27;t allowed. So \( f \) must be strictly increasing.

Therefore, \( f \) is a strictly increasing bijection. That&#x27;s helpful. So, for example, \( f(0) \) is the minimal value of \( f \), which must be 0 or some other number. Wait, but since \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and it&#x27;s a bijection, \( f(0) \) must be 0. Wait, let&#x27;s check that.

If \( f \) is a bijection from \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) to \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \), then it must map 0 to some number. Suppose \( f(0) = a \). Since it&#x27;s a bijection, \( a \) must be unique. Let&#x27;s plug \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \) into the original equation: \( f(f(0) + f(0)) = 0 + 0 = 0 \). So \( f(2a) = 0 \). But \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and since it&#x27;s injective, the only way \( f(2a) = 0 \) is if \( 2a \) is mapped uniquely. But if \( a = f(0) \), then \( a \) must be 0 because otherwise, \( 0 \) would be mapped to by \( 2a \), but \( a \) is already mapped to by 0, and since \( f \) is injective, \( 2a \) can&#x27;t also map to 0 unless \( 2a = a \), which would imply \( a = 0 \). Therefore, \( f(0) = 0 \).

Okay, so \( f(0) = 0 \). That&#x27;s a useful piece of information. Let&#x27;s note that down. So plugging \( m = 0 \) into the original equation gives us \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = 0 + n = n \). Since \( f(0) = 0 \), this simplifies to \( f(f(n)) = n \). Wait, so \( f \) is an involution, meaning that applying it twice gives the identity function. That is, \( f(f(n)) = n \) for all \( n \). That&#x27;s a key property.

So \( f \) is a bijective involution. Therefore, \( f \) is its own inverse. That&#x27;s a crucial observation. So if \( f(k) = l \), then \( f(l) = k \). This is because \( f(f(k)) = k \), so \( f(l) = k \). Therefore, the function pairs numbers in such a way that each pair \( (k, l) \) satisfies \( f(k) = l \) and \( f(l) = k \). However, if \( k = l \), then \( f(k) = k \), so fixed points are allowed. So \( f \) could be a permutation composed of transpositions (swaps of pairs) and fixed points.

But given that the function is strictly increasing (as we concluded earlier because decreasing would lead to contradictions in non-negative integers), then such transpositions would have to be arranged in a way that preserves the increasing order. But transpositions would require swapping elements, which might disrupt the increasing order. For example, if we swap 1 and 2, then \( f(1) = 2 \) and \( f(2) = 1 \), but then \( f(1) = 2 &gt; f(2) = 1 \), which contradicts the strictly increasing nature. Therefore, the only way for \( f \) to be a strictly increasing involution is if it is the identity function. Because any swap would violate the strictly increasing condition.

Therefore, if \( f \) is strictly increasing and an involution, then \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let me verify this. Suppose there exists some \( k \) such that \( f(k) \neq k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, either \( f(k) &gt; k \) or \( f(k) &lt; k \). Suppose \( f(k) = l &gt; k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \). But \( f(l) = k \) because \( f \) is an involution. However, \( k &lt; l \), so \( f(l) = k &lt; l \), but since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \geq f(k) + 1 = l + 1 \), which leads to a contradiction because \( k &lt; l \) and \( f(l) = k \geq l + 1 \) is impossible. Similarly, if \( f(k) = l &lt; k \), then \( f(l) = k \), but since \( l &lt; k \), \( f(l) = k &gt; l \), which again would require \( f(k) \geq f(l + 1) \geq f(l) + 1 = k + 1 \), which contradicts \( f(k) = l &lt; k \). Therefore, the only possibility is that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Therefore, the identity function is the only strictly increasing involution on \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \). Since our function \( f \) must be a strictly increasing bijection (as established earlier), and also an involution, the only solution is the identity function. Therefore, \( f(m) = m \) for all \( m \).

But let me just check again to make sure I haven&#x27;t missed any other possibilities. Suppose someone suggests another function, like \( f(m) = m + c \) for some constant \( c \). Let&#x27;s test this. Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + c + n + c) = (m + n + 2c) + c = m + n + 3c \). But this must equal \( m + n \), so \( 3c = 0 \), which implies \( c = 0 \). So that brings us back to the identity function.

Another thought: maybe a function that rearranges numbers in some way but still satisfies the condition. For example, suppose \( f(0) = 0 \), \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 1 \), and \( f(k) = k \) for \( k \geq 3 \). Let&#x27;s test this. Take \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \). Then \( f(f(1) + f(1)) = f(2 + 2) = f(4) = 4 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), so 4 ≠ 2. Therefore, this function doesn&#x27;t work. So swapping 1 and 2 causes a problem. Similarly, any swap would cause inconsistencies when the swapped numbers are used in the function&#x27;s arguments.

Alternatively, suppose we have a more complex permutation. But given the condition \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), it&#x27;s challenging to see how a non-identity permutation would satisfy this. For instance, let&#x27;s suppose that \( f(1) = a \), \( f(a) = 1 \). Then, taking \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(a + a) = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \). Then, applying \( f \) again, \( f(2) = 2a \). But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 0 \), we have \( f(2a + 0) = 2 + 0 = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \), which is consistent with the previous result. But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 2 \), we get \( f(2a + 2a) = f(4a) = 4 \). So \( f(4a) = 4 \), which implies \( f(4) = 4a \). Continuing this pattern, we see that if we set \( f(1) = a \), then \( f(2a) = 2 \), \( f(4a) = 4 \), etc. But since \( a \) must be a positive integer (as \( f \) maps to non-negative integers and is a bijection), if \( a &gt; 1 \), then \( 2a &gt; 2 \), so \( f(2a) = 2 \), but then \( f(2) = 2a \), which is greater than 2. But this would disrupt the strictly increasing nature of \( f \). For example, if \( a = 2 \), then \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 4 \), but then \( f(2) = 4 \) which is greater than \( f(3) \) must be 3 (if we follow the identity for other numbers). But that contradicts the strictly increasing requirement because 2 &lt; 3 but \( f(2) = 4 &gt; f(3) = 3 \). Hence, such a function cannot be increasing. Therefore, \( a \) must be 1, leading back to the identity function.

Another angle: suppose the function has some periodic behavior. For example, maybe even numbers are mapped to one sequence and odd numbers to another. But considering the bijectivity and the strictly increasing nature, it&#x27;s unclear how this could work without violating the functional equation. Let&#x27;s attempt a simple case. Suppose \( f(k) = k + 1 \) for even \( k \) and \( f(k) = k - 1 \) for odd \( k \). This swaps even and odd numbers. Let&#x27;s check \( f(f(m) + f(n)) \). Take \( m = 1 \) (odd), so \( f(1) = 0 \). \( n = 1 \), so \( f(1) = 0 \). Then \( f(0 + 0) = f(0) = 1 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), which is not equal to 1. So that doesn&#x27;t work. Another example: if \( f(k) = k + 2 \) for some \( k \), but then injectivity is lost unless it&#x27;s carefully constructed, which seems difficult.

Alternatively, maybe \( f(k) = c - k \) for some constant \( c \). But since the domain is non-negative integers, this would require \( c \geq k \) for all \( k \), which is impossible unless \( c \) is infinity, which isn&#x27;t a number. So that approach doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, but since \( f \) is an involution, another thought: if \( f \) is additive, meaning \( f(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \), but combined with the involution property. However, the given condition is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), which is different from additivity. If \( f \) were additive, then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(f(m)) + f(f(n)) = m + n \), which actually matches the given condition. So if \( f \) is additive and an involution, then it satisfies the equation. However, the only additive function on non-negative integers is linear, i.e., \( f(k) = ak \) for some constant \( a \). But given that \( f \) maps non-negative integers to non-negative integers and is bijective, \( a \) must be 1. Let&#x27;s verify:

Suppose \( f(k) = ak \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = a(a m + a n) = a^2(m + n) \). For this to equal \( m + n \), we need \( a^2 = 1 \), so \( a = 1 \), since \( a \) must be positive. Therefore, the only additive solution is the identity function. Therefore, even considering additive functions doesn&#x27;t give us any new solutions.

So far, all the lines of thought lead back to the identity function as the only solution. But to be thorough, let&#x27;s try to formally prove that \( f(m) = m \) is the only solution.

We already established that \( f \) is a bijection, strictly increasing, and an involution (i.e., \( f(f(k)) = k \) for all \( k \)). Let&#x27;s use induction to prove that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Base case: \( k = 0 \). We already showed \( f(0) = 0 \).

Inductive step: Assume that for all \( j &lt; k \), \( f(j) = j \). We need to show that \( f(k) = k \).

Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) &gt; f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Therefore, \( f(k) \geq k \) (because it has to be greater than all previous values, which are exactly 0, 1, ..., k-1). Suppose for contradiction that \( f(k) &gt; k \). Let \( f(k) = k + t \) where \( t \geq 1 \).

But since \( f \) is a bijection, there must be some \( m \) such that \( f(m) = k \). Because \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( m \) must be greater than or equal to \( k \) (since \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), so the pre-image of \( k \) must be less than \( k \), but wait, \( f \) is strictly increasing, so if \( f(m) = k \), then \( m \) must satisfy \( f(m) = k \). But since \( f \) is strictly increasing and \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), all values \( f(0), f(1), ..., f(k) \) are 0, 1, ..., k - 1, k + t. Therefore, the value \( k \) must be achieved by some \( m &lt; k \), but by the induction hypothesis, for \( m &lt; k \), \( f(m) = m \). Therefore, the only way \( f(m) = k \) is if \( m = k \), but this contradicts the induction hypothesis because \( m &lt; k \) would imply \( f(m) = m \neq k \). Therefore, there is a contradiction, meaning our assumption that \( f(k) &gt; k \) is false. Therefore, \( f(k) = k \).

Therefore, by induction, \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \).

Hence, the only function that satisfies the given condition is the identity function.

**Final Answer**
The only such function is the identity function, so the answer is \boxed{f(n) = n}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), we start by analyzing the given functional equation.

1. **Injectivity and Surjectivity**:
   - **Injectivity**: Suppose \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \) implies \( m + a = m + b \), so \( a = b \). Thus, \( f \) is injective.
   - **Surjectivity**: For any \( k \), setting \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \) gives \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k \). Let \( c = f(k) + f(0) \), then \( f(c) = k \). Thus, \( f \) is surjective.

2. **Bijectivity and Involution**:
   - Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it is bijective.
   - Setting \( m = 0 \) in the functional equation gives \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = n \). Knowing \( f(0) = 0 \) (from testing \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \)), we get \( f(f(n)) = n \). Thus, \( f \) is an involution.

3. **Strictly Increasing Nature**:
   - \( f \) must be strictly increasing. If not, there would be contradictions in the ordering of non-negative integers.

4. **Inductive Proof**:
   - **Base Case**: \( f(0) = 0 \).
   - **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) \geq k \). Suppose \( f(k) &gt; k \), then there must be some \( m &lt; k \) such that \( f(m) = k \), which contradicts the induction hypothesis. Hence, \( f(k) = k \).

Thus, the only function satisfying the given condition is the identity function. The final answer is \(\boxed{f(n) = n}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), the equation \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) holds. Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let&#x27;s recall that \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) means the set of all non-negative integers, which includes 0, 1, 2, and so on. So the function \( f \) takes non-negative integers and maps them to non-negative integers. The condition given is that if I take two numbers \( m \) and \( n \), apply \( f \) to each of them, add the results together, and then apply \( f \) again, I should get \( m + n \). Interesting. So \( f \) composed with addition somehow inverts the process?

Maybe I should start by checking if there are any simple functions that satisfy this. The first one that comes to mind is the identity function, where \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let&#x27;s test that:

If \( f(k) = k \), then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + n) = m + n \), which matches the given condition. So the identity function works. But the problem says &quot;find all functions,&quot; so there might be others, or maybe the identity is the only solution.

But before jumping to conclusions, let&#x27;s see if there are other possibilities. Sometimes functions can be involutions, meaning that applying them twice gives the identity. But in this case, the functional equation isn&#x27;t exactly an involution; it&#x27;s more like a nested function. Let&#x27;s try to analyze the properties that such a function \( f \) must have.

First, is \( f \) injective? Suppose that \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then, for any \( m \), consider \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \). By the given equation, this implies \( m + a = m + b \), which would mean \( a = b \). Therefore, \( f \) is injective.

Okay, so injectivity is established. What about surjectivity? Let&#x27;s see. For any non-negative integer \( k \), we need to find some \( c \) such that \( f(c) = k \). Let&#x27;s pick an arbitrary \( k \). Suppose we set \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \). Then the equation becomes \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k + 0 = k \). Let&#x27;s denote \( c = f(k) + f(0) \). Then \( f(c) = k \). Therefore, for any \( k \), there exists such a \( c \), so \( f \) is surjective.

Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it&#x27;s bijective. That&#x27;s a good start. Bijections have well-defined inverse functions, but since we&#x27;re dealing with non-negative integers, the inverse might not necessarily be a function unless we&#x27;re careful. However, knowing that \( f \) is bijective can help us manipulate the equation.

Let me think. Since \( f \) is bijective, maybe we can express \( f(m) + f(n) \) in terms of the inverse function. Wait, but the equation given is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \). If I denote \( f(m) + f(n) \) as some input to \( f \), which outputs \( m + n \). If \( f \) is invertible, then \( f^{-1}(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \). But wait, inverses of functions on integers can be tricky because they might not exist unless the function is strictly increasing or decreasing. But since \( f \) is bijective, it must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing? Hmm, but in non-negative integers, strictly decreasing would eventually hit zero and negative numbers, which aren&#x27;t allowed. So \( f \) must be strictly increasing.

Therefore, \( f \) is a strictly increasing bijection. That&#x27;s helpful. So, for example, \( f(0) \) is the minimal value of \( f \), which must be 0 or some other number. Wait, but since \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and it&#x27;s a bijection, \( f(0) \) must be 0. Wait, let&#x27;s check that.

If \( f \) is a bijection from \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) to \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \), then it must map 0 to some number. Suppose \( f(0) = a \). Since it&#x27;s a bijection, \( a \) must be unique. Let&#x27;s plug \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \) into the original equation: \( f(f(0) + f(0)) = 0 + 0 = 0 \). So \( f(2a) = 0 \). But \( f \) maps to non-negative integers, and since it&#x27;s injective, the only way \( f(2a) = 0 \) is if \( 2a \) is mapped uniquely. But if \( a = f(0) \), then \( a \) must be 0 because otherwise, \( 0 \) would be mapped to by \( 2a \), but \( a \) is already mapped to by 0, and since \( f \) is injective, \( 2a \) can&#x27;t also map to 0 unless \( 2a = a \), which would imply \( a = 0 \). Therefore, \( f(0) = 0 \).

Okay, so \( f(0) = 0 \). That&#x27;s a useful piece of information. Let&#x27;s note that down. So plugging \( m = 0 \) into the original equation gives us \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = 0 + n = n \). Since \( f(0) = 0 \), this simplifies to \( f(f(n)) = n \). Wait, so \( f \) is an involution, meaning that applying it twice gives the identity function. That is, \( f(f(n)) = n \) for all \( n \). That&#x27;s a key property.

So \( f \) is a bijective involution. Therefore, \( f \) is its own inverse. That&#x27;s a crucial observation. So if \( f(k) = l \), then \( f(l) = k \). This is because \( f(f(k)) = k \), so \( f(l) = k \). Therefore, the function pairs numbers in such a way that each pair \( (k, l) \) satisfies \( f(k) = l \) and \( f(l) = k \). However, if \( k = l \), then \( f(k) = k \), so fixed points are allowed. So \( f \) could be a permutation composed of transpositions (swaps of pairs) and fixed points.

But given that the function is strictly increasing (as we concluded earlier because decreasing would lead to contradictions in non-negative integers), then such transpositions would have to be arranged in a way that preserves the increasing order. But transpositions would require swapping elements, which might disrupt the increasing order. For example, if we swap 1 and 2, then \( f(1) = 2 \) and \( f(2) = 1 \), but then \( f(1) = 2 &gt; f(2) = 1 \), which contradicts the strictly increasing nature. Therefore, the only way for \( f \) to be a strictly increasing involution is if it is the identity function. Because any swap would violate the strictly increasing condition.

Therefore, if \( f \) is strictly increasing and an involution, then \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let me verify this. Suppose there exists some \( k \) such that \( f(k) \neq k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, either \( f(k) &gt; k \) or \( f(k) &lt; k \). Suppose \( f(k) = l &gt; k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \). But \( f(l) = k \) because \( f \) is an involution. However, \( k &lt; l \), so \( f(l) = k &lt; l \), but since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \geq f(k) + 1 = l + 1 \), which leads to a contradiction because \( k &lt; l \) and \( f(l) = k \geq l + 1 \) is impossible. Similarly, if \( f(k) = l &lt; k \), then \( f(l) = k \), but since \( l &lt; k \), \( f(l) = k &gt; l \), which again would require \( f(k) \geq f(l + 1) \geq f(l) + 1 = k + 1 \), which contradicts \( f(k) = l &lt; k \). Therefore, the only possibility is that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Therefore, the identity function is the only strictly increasing involution on \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \). Since our function \( f \) must be a strictly increasing bijection (as established earlier), and also an involution, the only solution is the identity function. Therefore, \( f(m) = m \) for all \( m \).

But let me just check again to make sure I haven&#x27;t missed any other possibilities. Suppose someone suggests another function, like \( f(m) = m + c \) for some constant \( c \). Let&#x27;s test this. Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + c + n + c) = (m + n + 2c) + c = m + n + 3c \). But this must equal \( m + n \), so \( 3c = 0 \), which implies \( c = 0 \). So that brings us back to the identity function.

Another thought: maybe a function that rearranges numbers in some way but still satisfies the condition. For example, suppose \( f(0) = 0 \), \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 1 \), and \( f(k) = k \) for \( k \geq 3 \). Let&#x27;s test this. Take \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \). Then \( f(f(1) + f(1)) = f(2 + 2) = f(4) = 4 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), so 4 ≠ 2. Therefore, this function doesn&#x27;t work. So swapping 1 and 2 causes a problem. Similarly, any swap would cause inconsistencies when the swapped numbers are used in the function&#x27;s arguments.

Alternatively, suppose we have a more complex permutation. But given the condition \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), it&#x27;s challenging to see how a non-identity permutation would satisfy this. For instance, let&#x27;s suppose that \( f(1) = a \), \( f(a) = 1 \). Then, taking \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(a + a) = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \). Then, applying \( f \) again, \( f(2) = 2a \). But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 0 \), we have \( f(2a + 0) = 2 + 0 = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \), which is consistent with the previous result. But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 2 \), we get \( f(2a + 2a) = f(4a) = 4 \). So \( f(4a) = 4 \), which implies \( f(4) = 4a \). Continuing this pattern, we see that if we set \( f(1) = a \), then \( f(2a) = 2 \), \( f(4a) = 4 \), etc. But since \( a \) must be a positive integer (as \( f \) maps to non-negative integers and is a bijection), if \( a &gt; 1 \), then \( 2a &gt; 2 \), so \( f(2a) = 2 \), but then \( f(2) = 2a \), which is greater than 2. But this would disrupt the strictly increasing nature of \( f \). For example, if \( a = 2 \), then \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 4 \), but then \( f(2) = 4 \) which is greater than \( f(3) \) must be 3 (if we follow the identity for other numbers). But that contradicts the strictly increasing requirement because 2 &lt; 3 but \( f(2) = 4 &gt; f(3) = 3 \). Hence, such a function cannot be increasing. Therefore, \( a \) must be 1, leading back to the identity function.

Another angle: suppose the function has some periodic behavior. For example, maybe even numbers are mapped to one sequence and odd numbers to another. But considering the bijectivity and the strictly increasing nature, it&#x27;s unclear how this could work without violating the functional equation. Let&#x27;s attempt a simple case. Suppose \( f(k) = k + 1 \) for even \( k \) and \( f(k) = k - 1 \) for odd \( k \). This swaps even and odd numbers. Let&#x27;s check \( f(f(m) + f(n)) \). Take \( m = 1 \) (odd), so \( f(1) = 0 \). \( n = 1 \), so \( f(1) = 0 \). Then \( f(0 + 0) = f(0) = 1 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), which is not equal to 1. So that doesn&#x27;t work. Another example: if \( f(k) = k + 2 \) for some \( k \), but then injectivity is lost unless it&#x27;s carefully constructed, which seems difficult.

Alternatively, maybe \( f(k) = c - k \) for some constant \( c \). But since the domain is non-negative integers, this would require \( c \geq k \) for all \( k \), which is impossible unless \( c \) is infinity, which isn&#x27;t a number. So that approach doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, but since \( f \) is an involution, another thought: if \( f \) is additive, meaning \( f(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \), but combined with the involution property. However, the given condition is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), which is different from additivity. If \( f \) were additive, then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(f(m)) + f(f(n)) = m + n \), which actually matches the given condition. So if \( f \) is additive and an involution, then it satisfies the equation. However, the only additive function on non-negative integers is linear, i.e., \( f(k) = ak \) for some constant \( a \). But given that \( f \) maps non-negative integers to non-negative integers and is bijective, \( a \) must be 1. Let&#x27;s verify:

Suppose \( f(k) = ak \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = a(a m + a n) = a^2(m + n) \). For this to equal \( m + n \), we need \( a^2 = 1 \), so \( a = 1 \), since \( a \) must be positive. Therefore, the only additive solution is the identity function. Therefore, even considering additive functions doesn&#x27;t give us any new solutions.

So far, all the lines of thought lead back to the identity function as the only solution. But to be thorough, let&#x27;s try to formally prove that \( f(m) = m \) is the only solution.

We already established that \( f \) is a bijection, strictly increasing, and an involution (i.e., \( f(f(k)) = k \) for all \( k \)). Let&#x27;s use induction to prove that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Base case: \( k = 0 \). We already showed \( f(0) = 0 \).

Inductive step: Assume that for all \( j &lt; k \), \( f(j) = j \). We need to show that \( f(k) = k \).

Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) &gt; f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Therefore, \( f(k) \geq k \) (because it has to be greater than all previous values, which are exactly 0, 1, ..., k-1). Suppose for contradiction that \( f(k) &gt; k \). Let \( f(k) = k + t \) where \( t \geq 1 \).

But since \( f \) is a bijection, there must be some \( m \) such that \( f(m) = k \). Because \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( m \) must be greater than or equal to \( k \) (since \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), so the pre-image of \( k \) must be less than \( k \), but wait, \( f \) is strictly increasing, so if \( f(m) = k \), then \( m \) must satisfy \( f(m) = k \). But since \( f \) is strictly increasing and \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), all values \( f(0), f(1), ..., f(k) \) are 0, 1, ..., k - 1, k + t. Therefore, the value \( k \) must be achieved by some \( m &lt; k \), but by the induction hypothesis, for \( m &lt; k \), \( f(m) = m \). Therefore, the only way \( f(m) = k \) is if \( m = k \), but this contradicts the induction hypothesis because \( m &lt; k \) would imply \( f(m) = m \neq k \). Therefore, there is a contradiction, meaning our assumption that \( f(k) &gt; k \) is false. Therefore, \( f(k) = k \).

Therefore, by induction, \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \).

Hence, the only function that satisfies the given condition is the identity function.

**Final Answer**
The only such function is the identity function, so the answer is \boxed{f(n) = n}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), we start by analyzing the given functional equation.

1. **Injectivity and Surjectivity**:
   - **Injectivity**: Suppose \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \) implies \( m + a = m + b \), so \( a = b \). Thus, \( f \) is injective.
   - **Surjectivity**: For any \( k \), setting \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \) gives \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k \). Let \( c = f(k) + f(0) \), then \( f(c) = k \). Thus, \( f \) is surjective.

2. **Bijectivity and Involution**:
   - Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it is bijective.
   - Setting \( m = 0 \) in the functional equation gives \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = n \). Knowing \( f(0) = 0 \) (from testing \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \)), we get \( f(f(n)) = n \). Thus, \( f \) is an involution.

3. **Strictly Increasing Nature**:
   - \( f \) must be strictly increasing. If not, there would be contradictions in the ordering of non-negative integers.

4. **Inductive Proof**:
   - **Base Case**: \( f(0) = 0 \).
   - **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) \geq k \). Suppose \( f(k) &gt; k \), then there must be some \( m &lt; k \) such that \( f(m) = k \), which contradicts the induction hypothesis. Hence, \( f(k) = k \).

Thus, the only function satisfying the given condition is the identity function. The final answer is \(\boxed{f(n) = n}\).          </p>

But transpositions would require swapping elements, which might disrupt the increasing order. For example, if we swap 1 and 2, then \( f(1) = 2 \) and \( f(2) = 1 \), but then \( f(1) = 2 &gt; f(2) = 1 \), which contradicts the strictly increasing nature. Therefore, the only way for \( f \) to be a strictly increasing involution is if it is the identity function. Because any swap would violate the strictly increasing condition.

Therefore, if \( f \) is strictly increasing and an involution, then \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \). Let me verify this. Suppose there exists some \( k \) such that \( f(k) \neq k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, either \( f(k) &gt; k \) or \( f(k) &lt; k \). Suppose \( f(k) = l &gt; k \). Then since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \). But \( f(l) = k \) because \( f \) is an involution. However, \( k &lt; l \), so \( f(l) = k &lt; l \), but since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(l) \geq f(k + 1) \geq f(k) + 1 = l + 1 \), which leads to a contradiction because \( k &lt; l \) and \( f(l) = k \geq l + 1 \) is impossible. Similarly, if \( f(k) = l &lt; k \), then \( f(l) = k \), but since \( l &lt; k \), \( f(l) = k &gt; l \), which again would require \( f(k) \geq f(l + 1) \geq f(l) + 1 = k + 1 \), which contradicts \( f(k) = l &lt; k \). Therefore, the only possibility is that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Therefore, the identity function is the only strictly increasing involution on \( \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \). Since our function \( f \) must be a strictly increasing bijection (as established earlier), and also an involution, the only solution is the identity function. Therefore, \( f(m) = m \) for all \( m \).

But let me just check again to make sure I haven&#x27;t missed any other possibilities. Suppose someone suggests another function, like \( f(m) = m + c \) for some constant \( c \). Let&#x27;s test this. Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(m + c + n + c) = (m + n + 2c) + c = m + n + 3c \). But this must equal \( m + n \), so \( 3c = 0 \), which implies \( c = 0 \). So that brings us back to the identity function.

Another thought: maybe a function that rearranges numbers in some way but still satisfies the condition. For example, suppose \( f(0) = 0 \), \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 1 \), and \( f(k) = k \) for \( k \geq 3 \). Let&#x27;s test this. Take \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \). Then \( f(f(1) + f(1)) = f(2 + 2) = f(4) = 4 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), so 4 ≠ 2. Therefore, this function doesn&#x27;t work. So swapping 1 and 2 causes a problem. Similarly, any swap would cause inconsistencies when the swapped numbers are used in the function&#x27;s arguments.

Alternatively, suppose we have a more complex permutation. But given the condition \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), it&#x27;s challenging to see how a non-identity permutation would satisfy this. For instance, let&#x27;s suppose that \( f(1) = a \), \( f(a) = 1 \). Then, taking \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(a + a) = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \). Then, applying \( f \) again, \( f(2) = 2a \). But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 0 \), we have \( f(2a + 0) = 2 + 0 = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(2a) = 2 \), which is consistent with the previous result. But then, taking \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 2 \), we get \( f(2a + 2a) = f(4a) = 4 \). So \( f(4a) = 4 \), which implies \( f(4) = 4a \). Continuing this pattern, we see that if we set \( f(1) = a \), then \( f(2a) = 2 \), \( f(4a) = 4 \), etc. But since \( a \) must be a positive integer (as \( f \) maps to non-negative integers and is a bijection), if \( a &gt; 1 \), then \( 2a &gt; 2 \), so \( f(2a) = 2 \), but then \( f(2) = 2a \), which is greater than 2. But this would disrupt the strictly increasing nature of \( f \). For example, if \( a = 2 \), then \( f(1) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 4 \), but then \( f(2) = 4 \) which is greater than \( f(3) \) must be 3 (if we follow the identity for other numbers). But that contradicts the strictly increasing requirement because 2 &lt; 3 but \( f(2) = 4 &gt; f(3) = 3 \). Hence, such a function cannot be increasing. Therefore, \( a \) must be 1, leading back to the identity function.

Another angle: suppose the function has some periodic behavior. For example, maybe even numbers are mapped to one sequence and odd numbers to another. But considering the bijectivity and the strictly increasing nature, it&#x27;s unclear how this could work without violating the functional equation. Let&#x27;s attempt a simple case. Suppose \( f(k) = k + 1 \) for even \( k \) and \( f(k) = k - 1 \) for odd \( k \). This swaps even and odd numbers. Let&#x27;s check \( f(f(m) + f(n)) \). Take \( m = 1 \) (odd), so \( f(1) = 0 \). \( n = 1 \), so \( f(1) = 0 \). Then \( f(0 + 0) = f(0) = 1 \). But \( m + n = 2 \), which is not equal to 1. So that doesn&#x27;t work. Another example: if \( f(k) = k + 2 \) for some \( k \), but then injectivity is lost unless it&#x27;s carefully constructed, which seems difficult.

Alternatively, maybe \( f(k) = c - k \) for some constant \( c \). But since the domain is non-negative integers, this would require \( c \geq k \) for all \( k \), which is impossible unless \( c \) is infinity, which isn&#x27;t a number. So that approach doesn&#x27;t work.

Wait, but since \( f \) is an involution, another thought: if \( f \) is additive, meaning \( f(m + n) = f(m) + f(n) \), but combined with the involution property. However, the given condition is \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \), which is different from additivity. If \( f \) were additive, then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = f(f(m)) + f(f(n)) = m + n \), which actually matches the given condition. So if \( f \) is additive and an involution, then it satisfies the equation. However, the only additive function on non-negative integers is linear, i.e., \( f(k) = ak \) for some constant \( a \). But given that \( f \) maps non-negative integers to non-negative integers and is bijective, \( a \) must be 1. Let&#x27;s verify:

Suppose \( f(k) = ak \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = a(a m + a n) = a^2(m + n) \). For this to equal \( m + n \), we need \( a^2 = 1 \), so \( a = 1 \), since \( a \) must be positive. Therefore, the only additive solution is the identity function. Therefore, even considering additive functions doesn&#x27;t give us any new solutions.

So far, all the lines of thought lead back to the identity function as the only solution. But to be thorough, let&#x27;s try to formally prove that \( f(m) = m \) is the only solution.

We already established that \( f \) is a bijection, strictly increasing, and an involution (i.e., \( f(f(k)) = k \) for all \( k \)). Let&#x27;s use induction to prove that \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \).

Base case: \( k = 0 \). We already showed \( f(0) = 0 \).

Inductive step: Assume that for all \( j &lt; k \), \( f(j) = j \). We need to show that \( f(k) = k \).

Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) &gt; f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Therefore, \( f(k) \geq k \) (because it has to be greater than all previous values, which are exactly 0, 1, ..., k-1). Suppose for contradiction that \( f(k) &gt; k \). Let \( f(k) = k + t \) where \( t \geq 1 \).

But since \( f \) is a bijection, there must be some \( m \) such that \( f(m) = k \). Because \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( m \) must be greater than or equal to \( k \) (since \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), so the pre-image of \( k \) must be less than \( k \), but wait, \( f \) is strictly increasing, so if \( f(m) = k \), then \( m \) must satisfy \( f(m) = k \). But since \( f \) is strictly increasing and \( f(k) = k + t \geq k + 1 \), all values \( f(0), f(1), ..., f(k) \) are 0, 1, ..., k - 1, k + t. Therefore, the value \( k \) must be achieved by some \( m &lt; k \), but by the induction hypothesis, for \( m &lt; k \), \( f(m) = m \). Therefore, the only way \( f(m) = k \) is if \( m = k \), but this contradicts the induction hypothesis because \( m &lt; k \) would imply \( f(m) = m \neq k \). Therefore, there is a contradiction, meaning our assumption that \( f(k) &gt; k \) is false. Therefore, \( f(k) = k \).

Therefore, by induction, \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \).

Hence, the only function that satisfies the given condition is the identity function.

**Final Answer**
The only such function is the identity function, so the answer is \boxed{f(n) = n}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To find all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \) such that \( f(f(m) + f(n)) = m + n \) for all non-negative integers \( m \) and \( n \), we start by analyzing the given functional equation.

1. **Injectivity and Surjectivity**:
   - **Injectivity**: Suppose \( f(a) = f(b) \). Then \( f(f(m) + f(a)) = f(f(m) + f(b)) \) implies \( m + a = m + b \), so \( a = b \). Thus, \( f \) is injective.
   - **Surjectivity**: For any \( k \), setting \( m = k \) and \( n = 0 \) gives \( f(f(k) + f(0)) = k \). Let \( c = f(k) + f(0) \), then \( f(c) = k \). Thus, \( f \) is surjective.

2. **Bijectivity and Involution**:
   - Since \( f \) is both injective and surjective, it is bijective.
   - Setting \( m = 0 \) in the functional equation gives \( f(f(0) + f(n)) = n \). Knowing \( f(0) = 0 \) (from testing \( m = 0 \) and \( n = 0 \)), we get \( f(f(n)) = n \). Thus, \( f \) is an involution.

3. **Strictly Increasing Nature**:
   - \( f \) must be strictly increasing. If not, there would be contradictions in the ordering of non-negative integers.

4. **Inductive Proof**:
   - **Base Case**: \( f(0) = 0 \).
   - **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(j) = j \) for all \( j &lt; k \). Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(k) \geq k \). Suppose \( f(k) &gt; k \), then there must be some \( m &lt; k \) such that \( f(m) = k \), which contradicts the induction hypothesis. Hence, \( f(k) = k \).

Thus, the only function satisfying the given condition is the identity function. The final answer is \(\boxed{f(n) = n}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=2 to n of 1/(k log k). Hmm, let&#x27;s start by writing that out properly. The expression is:

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=2}^n \frac{1}{k \log k}
\]

Alright, so this is an infinite series, and I need to determine whether it converges or diverges. If it converges, the limit will be a finite number; if it diverges, the limit will be infinity or doesn&#x27;t exist. 

First, let me recall some tests for convergence of series. The Integral Test comes to mind. The Integral Test says that if f(k) is a positive, continuous, decreasing function for all k ≥ N, then the series ∑_{k=N}^∞ f(k) converges if and only if the integral ∫_{N}^∞ f(x) dx converges.

So here, the function f(k) = 1/(k log k). Let&#x27;s check if it&#x27;s positive, continuous, and decreasing. For k ≥ 2, 1/(k log k) is definitely positive. The natural logarithm log k is defined and continuous for k &gt; 0, so log k is continuous for k ≥ 2. Then 1/(k log k) is also continuous. 

Is it decreasing? Let&#x27;s take the derivative of f(x) = 1/(x log x) with respect to x to check if it&#x27;s decreasing. Let me compute f&#x27;(x):

f(x) = (x log x)^{-1}

Using the chain rule:

f&#x27;(x) = -1 * (x log x)^{-2} * (d/dx [x log x])

Compute derivative of x log x:

d/dx [x log x] = log x + x*(1/x) = log x + 1

Therefore,

f&#x27;(x) = - (log x + 1) / (x log x)^2

For x ≥ 2, log x ≥ log 2 ≈ 0.693 &gt; 0, so log x + 1 &gt; 0. Thus, the numerator is positive, and the denominator is always positive since squared. Therefore, f&#x27;(x) is negative for x ≥ 2, which means f(x) is indeed decreasing.

Therefore, all the conditions for the Integral Test are satisfied. So the convergence of the series ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(k log k) is equivalent to the convergence of the integral ∫_{2}^∞ 1/(x log x) dx.

Let me compute that integral. Let&#x27;s make a substitution to evaluate it. Let u = log x. Then du/dx = 1/x, so du = dx/x. Therefore, dx = x du, but since x = e^u, dx = e^u du. Wait, no, that substitution might complicate things. Wait, let&#x27;s try again.

Wait, the integral is ∫ [1/(x log x)] dx. Let me set u = log x. Then du = (1/x) dx. So then, (1/x) dx = du. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫ [1/(x log x)] dx = ∫ [1/(x log x)] * x du = ∫ [1/(log x)] * (1/x) dx = ∫ [1/u] du. Wait, that seems too simple. Let me check.

Wait, if u = log x, then du = (1/x) dx. Then, 1/(x log x) dx = (1/u) du. So the integral becomes ∫ (1/u) du from u = log 2 to u = ∞. So that integral is ∫_{log 2}^∞ (1/u) du. 

But ∫ (1/u) du is log |u| + C, so evaluated from log 2 to infinity:

lim_{t→∞} [log t - log(log 2)] = lim_{t→∞} log t - log(log 2) = ∞ - log(log 2) = ∞.

Therefore, the integral diverges. Hence, by the Integral Test, the series ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(k log k) also diverges. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=2 to n of 1/(k log k) is infinity.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in substitution. Let me go through the integral again step by step.

Given integral ∫_{2}^∞ [1/(x log x)] dx.

Let u = log x. Then du = (1/x) dx. So, [1/(x log x)] dx = [1/(x u)] dx = (1/u) * (1/x dx) = (1/u) du. So, the integral becomes ∫_{u=log 2}^{u=∞} (1/u) du. Which is indeed ∫_{log 2}^∞ (1/u) du = [log u]_{log 2}^∞ = lim_{b→∞} (log b - log(log 2)) = ∞.

Therefore, yes, the integral diverges, hence the series diverges. Therefore, the original limit is infinity.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s another way to see this? Like comparison test. Let&#x27;s see. Since log k grows slower than any polynomial, so 1/(k log k) is asymptotically larger than, say, 1/(k^{1 + ε}) for any ε &gt; 0. But since ∑ 1/k diverges (harmonic series), and 1/(k log k) is smaller than 1/k. Wait, but the integral test shows divergence here. Hmm, but perhaps we can use comparison. Let me think.

Wait, since log k &lt; k^ε for any ε &gt; 0 when k is large enough, so 1/(k log k) &gt; 1/(k^{1 + ε}). But the series ∑ 1/(k^{1 + ε}) converges for any ε &gt; 0. However, our term is larger than a convergent series? Wait, no, if 1/(k log k) &gt; 1/(k^{1 + ε}), then since ∑1/k^{1 + ε} converges, the comparison test would not apply here because the terms are larger than a convergent series. The comparison test says that if a_n ≤ b_n and ∑b_n converges, then ∑a_n converges. Conversely, if a_n ≥ b_n and ∑b_n diverges, then ∑a_n diverges.

But in our case, we have 1/(k log k) is less than 1/k for k ≥2, since log k ≥ log 2 &gt;0. So 1/(k log k) ≤ 1/k * (1/log 2). Wait, but 1/k is the harmonic series, which diverges. So if we compare term-by-term, 1/(k log k) ≤ (1/log 2) * 1/k, but since ∑1/k diverges, we can&#x27;t conclude anything from this comparison. The fact that the terms are smaller than a divergent series doesn&#x27;t help; the series could converge or diverge.

Alternatively, if we can compare 1/(k log k) to a divergent series. But since 1/(k log k) is smaller than 1/k, which diverges, the comparison test is inconclusive here.

So, going back, the Integral Test was the right approach here. The integral ∫_{2}^∞ 1/(x log x) dx diverges, so the series must diverge. Therefore, the limit is infinity.

Alternatively, maybe using Cauchy condensation test. The Cauchy condensation test states that for a non-increasing sequence a_n, the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n converges if and only if ∑_{k=0}^∞ 2^k a_{2^k} converges.

So let&#x27;s apply the Cauchy condensation test here. Our sequence is a_n = 1/(n log n) for n ≥2. Let&#x27;s adjust the index to start at k=1 where a_{2^k} would correspond to n=2,4,8,...

Wait, for k ≥1, 2^k ≥2, so:

Sum_{k=1}^∞ 2^k a_{2^k} = Sum_{k=1}^∞ 2^k * [1/(2^k log 2^k)] = Sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/log 2^k] = Sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/(k log 2)].

Because log 2^k = k log 2. Therefore, this becomes Sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(k log 2) = (1/log 2) Sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k, which is the harmonic series multiplied by a constant. Since the harmonic series diverges, the condensed series diverges, so the original series also diverges by the Cauchy condensation test. Therefore, confirming the earlier result.

Hence, the limit is infinity. Therefore, the answer is that the series diverges to infinity.

**Final Answer**
The limit diverges to infinity, so the answer is \boxed{\infty}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=2}^n \frac{1}{k \log k}\), we need to determine whether the series \(\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{k \log k}\) converges or diverges.

We use the Integral Test, which states that for a positive, continuous, decreasing function \(f(k)\), the series \(\sum_{k=N}^\infty f(k)\) converges if and only if the integral \(\int_{N}^\infty f(x) \, dx\) converges.

Here, the function \(f(k) = \frac{1}{k \log k}\) is positive, continuous, and decreasing for \(k \geq 2\). We compute the integral:

\[
\int_{2}^\infty \frac{1}{x \log x} \, dx
\]

Using the substitution \(u = \log x\), we get \(du = \frac{1}{x} \, dx\). The integral transforms to:

\[
\int_{\log 2}^\infty \frac{1}{u} \, du
\]

This integral evaluates to:

\[
\left[ \log u \right]_{\log 2}^\infty = \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( \log b - \log (\log 2) \right) = \infty
\]

Since the integral diverges, by the Integral Test, the series \(\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{k \log k}\) also diverges.

To confirm, we apply the Cauchy Condensation Test. The condensed series is:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^\infty 2^k \cdot \frac{1}{2^k \log 2^k} = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k \log 2}
\]

This is a constant multiple of the harmonic series, which diverges. Hence, the original series diverges.

Thus, the limit is \(\boxed{\infty}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=2 to n of 1/(k log k). Hmm, let&#x27;s start by writing that out properly. The expression is:

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=2}^n \frac{1}{k \log k}
\]

Alright, so this is an infinite series, and I need to determine whether it converges or diverges. If it converges, the limit will be a finite number; if it diverges, the limit will be infinity or doesn&#x27;t exist. 

First, let me recall some tests for convergence of series. The Integral Test comes to mind. The Integral Test says that if f(k) is a positive, continuous, decreasing function for all k ≥ N, then the series ∑_{k=N}^∞ f(k) converges if and only if the integral ∫_{N}^∞ f(x) dx converges.

So here, the function f(k) = 1/(k log k). Let&#x27;s check if it&#x27;s positive, continuous, and decreasing. For k ≥ 2, 1/(k log k) is definitely positive. The natural logarithm log k is defined and continuous for k &gt; 0, so log k is continuous for k ≥ 2. Then 1/(k log k) is also continuous. 

Is it decreasing? Let&#x27;s take the derivative of f(x) = 1/(x log x) with respect to x to check if it&#x27;s decreasing. Let me compute f&#x27;(x):

f(x) = (x log x)^{-1}

Using the chain rule:

f&#x27;(x) = -1 * (x log x)^{-2} * (d/dx [x log x])

Compute derivative of x log x:

d/dx [x log x] = log x + x*(1/x) = log x + 1

Therefore,

f&#x27;(x) = - (log x + 1) / (x log x)^2

For x ≥ 2, log x ≥ log 2 ≈ 0.693 &gt; 0, so log x + 1 &gt; 0. Thus, the numerator is positive, and the denominator is always positive since squared. Therefore, f&#x27;(x) is negative for x ≥ 2, which means f(x) is indeed decreasing.

Therefore, all the conditions for the Integral Test are satisfied. So the convergence of the series ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(k log k) is equivalent to the convergence of the integral ∫_{2}^∞ 1/(x log x) dx.

Let me compute that integral. Let&#x27;s make a substitution to evaluate it. Let u = log x. Then du/dx = 1/x, so du = dx/x. Therefore, dx = x du, but since x = e^u, dx = e^u du. Wait, no, that substitution might complicate things. Wait, let&#x27;s try again.

Wait, the integral is ∫ [1/(x log x)] dx. Let me set u = log x. Then du = (1/x) dx. So then, (1/x) dx = du. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫ [1/(x log x)] dx = ∫ [1/(x log x)] * x du = ∫ [1/(log x)] * (1/x) dx = ∫ [1/u] du. Wait, that seems too simple. Let me check.

Wait, if u = log x, then du = (1/x) dx. Then, 1/(x log x) dx = (1/u) du. So the integral becomes ∫ (1/u) du from u = log 2 to u = ∞. So that integral is ∫_{log 2}^∞ (1/u) du. 

But ∫ (1/u) du is log |u| + C, so evaluated from log 2 to infinity:

lim_{t→∞} [log t - log(log 2)] = lim_{t→∞} log t - log(log 2) = ∞ - log(log 2) = ∞.

Therefore, the integral diverges. Hence, by the Integral Test, the series ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(k log k) also diverges. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=2 to n of 1/(k log k) is infinity.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in substitution. Let me go through the integral again step by step.

Given integral ∫_{2}^∞ [1/(x log x)] dx.

Let u = log x. Then du = (1/x) dx. So, [1/(x log x)] dx = [1/(x u)] dx = (1/u) * (1/x dx) = (1/u) du. So, the integral becomes ∫_{u=log 2}^{u=∞} (1/u) du. Which is indeed ∫_{log 2}^∞ (1/u) du = [log u]_{log 2}^∞ = lim_{b→∞} (log b - log(log 2)) = ∞.

Therefore, yes, the integral diverges, hence the series diverges. Therefore, the original limit is infinity.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s another way to see this? Like comparison test. Let&#x27;s see. Since log k grows slower than any polynomial, so 1/(k log k) is asymptotically larger than, say, 1/(k^{1 + ε}) for any ε &gt; 0. But since ∑ 1/k diverges (harmonic series), and 1/(k log k) is smaller than 1/k. Wait, but the integral test shows divergence here. Hmm, but perhaps we can use comparison. Let me think.

Wait, since log k &lt; k^ε for any ε &gt; 0 when k is large enough, so 1/(k log k) &gt; 1/(k^{1 + ε}). But the series ∑ 1/(k^{1 + ε}) converges for any ε &gt; 0. However, our term is larger than a convergent series? Wait, no, if 1/(k log k) &gt; 1/(k^{1 + ε}), then since ∑1/k^{1 + ε} converges, the comparison test would not apply here because the terms are larger than a convergent series. The comparison test says that if a_n ≤ b_n and ∑b_n converges, then ∑a_n converges. Conversely, if a_n ≥ b_n and ∑b_n diverges, then ∑a_n diverges.

But in our case, we have 1/(k log k) is less than 1/k for k ≥2, since log k ≥ log 2 &gt;0. So 1/(k log k) ≤ 1/k * (1/log 2). Wait, but 1/k is the harmonic series, which diverges. So if we compare term-by-term, 1/(k log k) ≤ (1/log 2) * 1/k, but since ∑1/k diverges, we can&#x27;t conclude anything from this comparison. The fact that the terms are smaller than a divergent series doesn&#x27;t help; the series could converge or diverge.

Alternatively, if we can compare 1/(k log k) to a divergent series. But since 1/(k log k) is smaller than 1/k, which diverges, the comparison test is inconclusive here.

So, going back, the Integral Test was the right approach here. The integral ∫_{2}^∞ 1/(x log x) dx diverges, so the series must diverge. Therefore, the limit is infinity.

Alternatively, maybe using Cauchy condensation test. The Cauchy condensation test states that for a non-increasing sequence a_n, the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n converges if and only if ∑_{k=0}^∞ 2^k a_{2^k} converges.

So let&#x27;s apply the Cauchy condensation test here. Our sequence is a_n = 1/(n log n) for n ≥2. Let&#x27;s adjust the index to start at k=1 where a_{2^k} would correspond to n=2,4,8,...

Wait, for k ≥1, 2^k ≥2, so:

Sum_{k=1}^∞ 2^k a_{2^k} = Sum_{k=1}^∞ 2^k * [1/(2^k log 2^k)] = Sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/log 2^k] = Sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/(k log 2)].

Because log 2^k = k log 2. Therefore, this becomes Sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(k log 2) = (1/log 2) Sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k, which is the harmonic series multiplied by a constant. Since the harmonic series diverges, the condensed series diverges, so the original series also diverges by the Cauchy condensation test. Therefore, confirming the earlier result.

Hence, the limit is infinity. Therefore, the answer is that the series diverges to infinity.

**Final Answer**
The limit diverges to infinity, so the answer is \boxed{\infty}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=2}^n \frac{1}{k \log k}\), we need to determine whether the series \(\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{k \log k}\) converges or diverges.

We use the Integral Test, which states that for a positive, continuous, decreasing function \(f(k)\), the series \(\sum_{k=N}^\infty f(k)\) converges if and only if the integral \(\int_{N}^\infty f(x) \, dx\) converges.

Here, the function \(f(k) = \frac{1}{k \log k}\) is positive, continuous, and decreasing for \(k \geq 2\). We compute the integral:

\[
\int_{2}^\infty \frac{1}{x \log x} \, dx
\]

Using the substitution \(u = \log x\), we get \(du = \frac{1}{x} \, dx\). The integral transforms to:

\[
\int_{\log 2}^\infty \frac{1}{u} \, du
\]

This integral evaluates to:

\[
\left[ \log u \right]_{\log 2}^\infty = \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( \log b - \log (\log 2) \right) = \infty
\]

Since the integral diverges, by the Integral Test, the series \(\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{k \log k}\) also diverges.

To confirm, we apply the Cauchy Condensation Test. The condensed series is:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^\infty 2^k \cdot \frac{1}{2^k \log 2^k} = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k \log 2}
\]

This is a constant multiple of the harmonic series, which diverges. Hence, the original series diverges.

Thus, the limit is \(\boxed{\infty}\).          </p>

So, going back, the Integral Test was the right approach here. The integral ∫_{2}^∞ 1/(x log x) dx diverges, so the series must diverge. Therefore, the limit is infinity.

Alternatively, maybe using Cauchy condensation test. The Cauchy condensation test states that for a non-increasing sequence a_n, the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n converges if and only if ∑_{k=0}^∞ 2^k a_{2^k} converges.

So let&#x27;s apply the Cauchy condensation test here. Our sequence is a_n = 1/(n log n) for n ≥2. Let&#x27;s adjust the index to start at k=1 where a_{2^k} would correspond to n=2,4,8,...

Wait, for k ≥1, 2^k ≥2, so:

Sum_{k=1}^∞ 2^k a_{2^k} = Sum_{k=1}^∞ 2^k * [1/(2^k log 2^k)] = Sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/log 2^k] = Sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/(k log 2)].

Because log 2^k = k log 2. Therefore, this becomes Sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(k log 2) = (1/log 2) Sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k, which is the harmonic series multiplied by a constant. Since the harmonic series diverges, the condensed series diverges, so the original series also diverges by the Cauchy condensation test. Therefore, confirming the earlier result.

Hence, the limit is infinity. Therefore, the answer is that the series diverges to infinity.

**Final Answer**
The limit diverges to infinity, so the answer is \boxed{\infty}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=2}^n \frac{1}{k \log k}\), we need to determine whether the series \(\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{k \log k}\) converges or diverges.

We use the Integral Test, which states that for a positive, continuous, decreasing function \(f(k)\), the series \(\sum_{k=N}^\infty f(k)\) converges if and only if the integral \(\int_{N}^\infty f(x) \, dx\) converges.

Here, the function \(f(k) = \frac{1}{k \log k}\) is positive, continuous, and decreasing for \(k \geq 2\). We compute the integral:

\[
\int_{2}^\infty \frac{1}{x \log x} \, dx
\]

Using the substitution \(u = \log x\), we get \(du = \frac{1}{x} \, dx\). The integral transforms to:

\[
\int_{\log 2}^\infty \frac{1}{u} \, du
\]

This integral evaluates to:

\[
\left[ \log u \right]_{\log 2}^\infty = \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( \log b - \log (\log 2) \right) = \infty
\]

Since the integral diverges, by the Integral Test, the series \(\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{k \log k}\) also diverges.

To confirm, we apply the Cauchy Condensation Test. The condensed series is:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^\infty 2^k \cdot \frac{1}{2^k \log 2^k} = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k \log 2}
\]

This is a constant multiple of the harmonic series, which diverges. Hence, the original series diverges.

Thus, the limit is \(\boxed{\infty}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=2 to n of 1/(k log k). Hmm, let&#x27;s start by writing that out properly. The expression is:

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=2}^n \frac{1}{k \log k}
\]

Alright, so this is an infinite series, and I need to determine whether it converges or diverges. If it converges, the limit will be a finite number; if it diverges, the limit will be infinity or doesn&#x27;t exist. 

First, let me recall some tests for convergence of series. The Integral Test comes to mind. The Integral Test says that if f(k) is a positive, continuous, decreasing function for all k ≥ N, then the series ∑_{k=N}^∞ f(k) converges if and only if the integral ∫_{N}^∞ f(x) dx converges.

So here, the function f(k) = 1/(k log k). Let&#x27;s check if it&#x27;s positive, continuous, and decreasing. For k ≥ 2, 1/(k log k) is definitely positive. The natural logarithm log k is defined and continuous for k &gt; 0, so log k is continuous for k ≥ 2. Then 1/(k log k) is also continuous. 

Is it decreasing? Let&#x27;s take the derivative of f(x) = 1/(x log x) with respect to x to check if it&#x27;s decreasing. Let me compute f&#x27;(x):

f(x) = (x log x)^{-1}

Using the chain rule:

f&#x27;(x) = -1 * (x log x)^{-2} * (d/dx [x log x])

Compute derivative of x log x:

d/dx [x log x] = log x + x*(1/x) = log x + 1

Therefore,

f&#x27;(x) = - (log x + 1) / (x log x)^2

For x ≥ 2, log x ≥ log 2 ≈ 0.693 &gt; 0, so log x + 1 &gt; 0. Thus, the numerator is positive, and the denominator is always positive since squared. Therefore, f&#x27;(x) is negative for x ≥ 2, which means f(x) is indeed decreasing.

Therefore, all the conditions for the Integral Test are satisfied. So the convergence of the series ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(k log k) is equivalent to the convergence of the integral ∫_{2}^∞ 1/(x log x) dx.

Let me compute that integral. Let&#x27;s make a substitution to evaluate it. Let u = log x. Then du/dx = 1/x, so du = dx/x. Therefore, dx = x du, but since x = e^u, dx = e^u du. Wait, no, that substitution might complicate things. Wait, let&#x27;s try again.

Wait, the integral is ∫ [1/(x log x)] dx. Let me set u = log x. Then du = (1/x) dx. So then, (1/x) dx = du. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫ [1/(x log x)] dx = ∫ [1/(x log x)] * x du = ∫ [1/(log x)] * (1/x) dx = ∫ [1/u] du. Wait, that seems too simple. Let me check.

Wait, if u = log x, then du = (1/x) dx. Then, 1/(x log x) dx = (1/u) du. So the integral becomes ∫ (1/u) du from u = log 2 to u = ∞. So that integral is ∫_{log 2}^∞ (1/u) du. 

But ∫ (1/u) du is log |u| + C, so evaluated from log 2 to infinity:

lim_{t→∞} [log t - log(log 2)] = lim_{t→∞} log t - log(log 2) = ∞ - log(log 2) = ∞.

Therefore, the integral diverges. Hence, by the Integral Test, the series ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(k log k) also diverges. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=2 to n of 1/(k log k) is infinity.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in substitution. Let me go through the integral again step by step.

Given integral ∫_{2}^∞ [1/(x log x)] dx.

Let u = log x. Then du = (1/x) dx. So, [1/(x log x)] dx = [1/(x u)] dx = (1/u) * (1/x dx) = (1/u) du. So, the integral becomes ∫_{u=log 2}^{u=∞} (1/u) du. Which is indeed ∫_{log 2}^∞ (1/u) du = [log u]_{log 2}^∞ = lim_{b→∞} (log b - log(log 2)) = ∞.

Therefore, yes, the integral diverges, hence the series diverges. Therefore, the original limit is infinity.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s another way to see this? Like comparison test. Let&#x27;s see. Since log k grows slower than any polynomial, so 1/(k log k) is asymptotically larger than, say, 1/(k^{1 + ε}) for any ε &gt; 0. But since ∑ 1/k diverges (harmonic series), and 1/(k log k) is smaller than 1/k. Wait, but the integral test shows divergence here. Hmm, but perhaps we can use comparison. Let me think.

Wait, since log k &lt; k^ε for any ε &gt; 0 when k is large enough, so 1/(k log k) &gt; 1/(k^{1 + ε}). But the series ∑ 1/(k^{1 + ε}) converges for any ε &gt; 0. However, our term is larger than a convergent series? Wait, no, if 1/(k log k) &gt; 1/(k^{1 + ε}), then since ∑1/k^{1 + ε} converges, the comparison test would not apply here because the terms are larger than a convergent series. The comparison test says that if a_n ≤ b_n and ∑b_n converges, then ∑a_n converges. Conversely, if a_n ≥ b_n and ∑b_n diverges, then ∑a_n diverges.

But in our case, we have 1/(k log k) is less than 1/k for k ≥2, since log k ≥ log 2 &gt;0. So 1/(k log k) ≤ 1/k * (1/log 2). Wait, but 1/k is the harmonic series, which diverges. So if we compare term-by-term, 1/(k log k) ≤ (1/log 2) * 1/k, but since ∑1/k diverges, we can&#x27;t conclude anything from this comparison. The fact that the terms are smaller than a divergent series doesn&#x27;t help; the series could converge or diverge.

Alternatively, if we can compare 1/(k log k) to a divergent series. But since 1/(k log k) is smaller than 1/k, which diverges, the comparison test is inconclusive here.

Sum_{k=1}^∞ 2^k a_{2^k} = Sum_{k=1}^∞ 2^k * [1/(2^k log 2^k)] = Sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/log 2^k] = Sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/(k log 2)].

Because log 2^k = k log 2. Therefore, this becomes Sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(k log 2) = (1/log 2) Sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k, which is the harmonic series multiplied by a constant. Since the harmonic series diverges, the condensed series diverges, so the original series also diverges by the Cauchy condensation test. Therefore, confirming the earlier result.

Wait, if u = log x, then du = (1/x) dx. Then, 1/(x log x) dx = (1/u) du. So the integral becomes ∫ (1/u) du from u = log 2 to u = ∞. So that integral is ∫_{log 2}^∞ (1/u) du. 

But ∫ (1/u) du is log |u| + C, so evaluated from log 2 to infinity:

lim_{t→∞} [log t - log(log 2)] = lim_{t→∞} log t - log(log 2) = ∞ - log(log 2) = ∞.

Therefore, the integral diverges. Hence, by the Integral Test, the series ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(k log k) also diverges. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=2 to n of 1/(k log k) is infinity.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in substitution. Let me go through the integral again step by step.

Given integral ∫_{2}^∞ [1/(x log x)] dx.

Let u = log x. Then du = (1/x) dx. So, [1/(x log x)] dx = [1/(x u)] dx = (1/u) * (1/x dx) = (1/u) du. So, the integral becomes ∫_{u=log 2}^{u=∞} (1/u) du. Which is indeed ∫_{log 2}^∞ (1/u) du = [log u]_{log 2}^∞ = lim_{b→∞} (log b - log(log 2)) = ∞.

Therefore, yes, the integral diverges, hence the series diverges. Therefore, the original limit is infinity.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s another way to see this? Like comparison test. Let&#x27;s see. Since log k grows slower than any polynomial, so 1/(k log k) is asymptotically larger than, say, 1/(k^{1 + ε}) for any ε &gt; 0. But since ∑ 1/k diverges (harmonic series), and 1/(k log k) is smaller than 1/k. Wait, but the integral test shows divergence here. Hmm, but perhaps we can use comparison. Let me think.

Wait, since log k &lt; k^ε for any ε &gt; 0 when k is large enough, so 1/(k log k) &gt; 1/(k^{1 + ε}). But the series ∑ 1/(k^{1 + ε}) converges for any ε &gt; 0. However, our term is larger than a convergent series? Wait, no, if 1/(k log k) &gt; 1/(k^{1 + ε}), then since ∑1/k^{1 + ε} converges, the comparison test would not apply here because the terms are larger than a convergent series. The comparison test says that if a_n ≤ b_n and ∑b_n converges, then ∑a_n converges. Conversely, if a_n ≥ b_n and ∑b_n diverges, then ∑a_n diverges.

But in our case, we have 1/(k log k) is less than 1/k for k ≥2, since log k ≥ log 2 &gt;0. So 1/(k log k) ≤ 1/k * (1/log 2). Wait, but 1/k is the harmonic series, which diverges. So if we compare term-by-term, 1/(k log k) ≤ (1/log 2) * 1/k, but since ∑1/k diverges, we can&#x27;t conclude anything from this comparison. The fact that the terms are smaller than a divergent series doesn&#x27;t help; the series could converge or diverge.

Alternatively, if we can compare 1/(k log k) to a divergent series. But since 1/(k log k) is smaller than 1/k, which diverges, the comparison test is inconclusive here.

So, going back, the Integral Test was the right approach here. The integral ∫_{2}^∞ 1/(x log x) dx diverges, so the series must diverge. Therefore, the limit is infinity.

Alternatively, maybe using Cauchy condensation test. The Cauchy condensation test states that for a non-increasing sequence a_n, the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n converges if and only if ∑_{k=0}^∞ 2^k a_{2^k} converges.

So let&#x27;s apply the Cauchy condensation test here. Our sequence is a_n = 1/(n log n) for n ≥2. Let&#x27;s adjust the index to start at k=1 where a_{2^k} would correspond to n=2,4,8,...

Wait, for k ≥1, 2^k ≥2, so:

Sum_{k=1}^∞ 2^k a_{2^k} = Sum_{k=1}^∞ 2^k * [1/(2^k log 2^k)] = Sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/log 2^k] = Sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/(k log 2)].

Because log 2^k = k log 2. Therefore, this becomes Sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(k log 2) = (1/log 2) Sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k, which is the harmonic series multiplied by a constant. Since the harmonic series diverges, the condensed series diverges, so the original series also diverges by the Cauchy condensation test. Therefore, confirming the earlier result.

Hence, the limit is infinity. Therefore, the answer is that the series diverges to infinity.

**Final Answer**
The limit diverges to infinity, so the answer is \boxed{\infty}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=2}^n \frac{1}{k \log k}\), we need to determine whether the series \(\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{k \log k}\) converges or diverges.

We use the Integral Test, which states that for a positive, continuous, decreasing function \(f(k)\), the series \(\sum_{k=N}^\infty f(k)\) converges if and only if the integral \(\int_{N}^\infty f(x) \, dx\) converges.

Here, the function \(f(k) = \frac{1}{k \log k}\) is positive, continuous, and decreasing for \(k \geq 2\). We compute the integral:

\[
\int_{2}^\infty \frac{1}{x \log x} \, dx
\]

Using the substitution \(u = \log x\), we get \(du = \frac{1}{x} \, dx\). The integral transforms to:

\[
\int_{\log 2}^\infty \frac{1}{u} \, du
\]

This integral evaluates to:

\[
\left[ \log u \right]_{\log 2}^\infty = \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( \log b - \log (\log 2) \right) = \infty
\]

Since the integral diverges, by the Integral Test, the series \(\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{k \log k}\) also diverges.

To confirm, we apply the Cauchy Condensation Test. The condensed series is:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^\infty 2^k \cdot \frac{1}{2^k \log 2^k} = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k \log 2}
\]

This is a constant multiple of the harmonic series, which diverges. Hence, the original series diverges.

Thus, the limit is \(\boxed{\infty}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=2 to n of 1/(k log k). Hmm, let&#x27;s start by writing that out properly. The expression is:

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=2}^n \frac{1}{k \log k}
\]

Alright, so this is an infinite series, and I need to determine whether it converges or diverges. If it converges, the limit will be a finite number; if it diverges, the limit will be infinity or doesn&#x27;t exist. 

First, let me recall some tests for convergence of series. The Integral Test comes to mind. The Integral Test says that if f(k) is a positive, continuous, decreasing function for all k ≥ N, then the series ∑_{k=N}^∞ f(k) converges if and only if the integral ∫_{N}^∞ f(x) dx converges.

So here, the function f(k) = 1/(k log k). Let&#x27;s check if it&#x27;s positive, continuous, and decreasing. For k ≥ 2, 1/(k log k) is definitely positive. The natural logarithm log k is defined and continuous for k &gt; 0, so log k is continuous for k ≥ 2. Then 1/(k log k) is also continuous. 

Is it decreasing? Let&#x27;s take the derivative of f(x) = 1/(x log x) with respect to x to check if it&#x27;s decreasing. Let me compute f&#x27;(x):

f(x) = (x log x)^{-1}

Using the chain rule:

f&#x27;(x) = -1 * (x log x)^{-2} * (d/dx [x log x])

Compute derivative of x log x:

d/dx [x log x] = log x + x*(1/x) = log x + 1

Therefore,

f&#x27;(x) = - (log x + 1) / (x log x)^2

For x ≥ 2, log x ≥ log 2 ≈ 0.693 &gt; 0, so log x + 1 &gt; 0. Thus, the numerator is positive, and the denominator is always positive since squared. Therefore, f&#x27;(x) is negative for x ≥ 2, which means f(x) is indeed decreasing.

Therefore, all the conditions for the Integral Test are satisfied. So the convergence of the series ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(k log k) is equivalent to the convergence of the integral ∫_{2}^∞ 1/(x log x) dx.

Let me compute that integral. Let&#x27;s make a substitution to evaluate it. Let u = log x. Then du/dx = 1/x, so du = dx/x. Therefore, dx = x du, but since x = e^u, dx = e^u du. Wait, no, that substitution might complicate things. Wait, let&#x27;s try again.

Wait, the integral is ∫ [1/(x log x)] dx. Let me set u = log x. Then du = (1/x) dx. So then, (1/x) dx = du. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫ [1/(x log x)] dx = ∫ [1/(x log x)] * x du = ∫ [1/(log x)] * (1/x) dx = ∫ [1/u] du. Wait, that seems too simple. Let me check.

Wait, if u = log x, then du = (1/x) dx. Then, 1/(x log x) dx = (1/u) du. So the integral becomes ∫ (1/u) du from u = log 2 to u = ∞. So that integral is ∫_{log 2}^∞ (1/u) du. 

But ∫ (1/u) du is log |u| + C, so evaluated from log 2 to infinity:

lim_{t→∞} [log t - log(log 2)] = lim_{t→∞} log t - log(log 2) = ∞ - log(log 2) = ∞.

Therefore, the integral diverges. Hence, by the Integral Test, the series ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(k log k) also diverges. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=2 to n of 1/(k log k) is infinity.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in substitution. Let me go through the integral again step by step.

Let u = log x. Then du = (1/x) dx. So, [1/(x log x)] dx = [1/(x u)] dx = (1/u) * (1/x dx) = (1/u) du. So, the integral becomes ∫_{u=log 2}^{u=∞} (1/u) du. Which is indeed ∫_{log 2}^∞ (1/u) du = [log u]_{log 2}^∞ = lim_{b→∞} (log b - log(log 2)) = ∞.

Because log 2^k = k log 2. Therefore, this becomes Sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(k log 2) = (1/log 2) Sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k, which is the harmonic series multiplied by a constant.

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=2 to n of 1/(k log k). Hmm, let&#x27;s start by writing that out properly. The expression is:

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=2}^n \frac{1}{k \log k}
\]

Alright, so this is an infinite series, and I need to determine whether it converges or diverges. If it converges, the limit will be a finite number; if it diverges, the limit will be infinity or doesn&#x27;t exist. 

First, let me recall some tests for convergence of series. The Integral Test comes to mind. The Integral Test says that if f(k) is a positive, continuous, decreasing function for all k ≥ N, then the series ∑_{k=N}^∞ f(k) converges if and only if the integral ∫_{N}^∞ f(x) dx converges.

So here, the function f(k) = 1/(k log k). Let&#x27;s check if it&#x27;s positive, continuous, and decreasing. For k ≥ 2, 1/(k log k) is definitely positive. The natural logarithm log k is defined and continuous for k &gt; 0, so log k is continuous for k ≥ 2. Then 1/(k log k) is also continuous. 

Is it decreasing? Let&#x27;s take the derivative of f(x) = 1/(x log x) with respect to x to check if it&#x27;s decreasing. Let me compute f&#x27;(x):

f(x) = (x log x)^{-1}

Using the chain rule:

f&#x27;(x) = -1 * (x log x)^{-2} * (d/dx [x log x])

Compute derivative of x log x:

d/dx [x log x] = log x + x*(1/x) = log x + 1

Therefore,

f&#x27;(x) = - (log x + 1) / (x log x)^2

For x ≥ 2, log x ≥ log 2 ≈ 0.693 &gt; 0, so log x + 1 &gt; 0. Thus, the numerator is positive, and the denominator is always positive since squared. Therefore, f&#x27;(x) is negative for x ≥ 2, which means f(x) is indeed decreasing.

Therefore, all the conditions for the Integral Test are satisfied. So the convergence of the series ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(k log k) is equivalent to the convergence of the integral ∫_{2}^∞ 1/(x log x) dx.

Let me compute that integral. Let&#x27;s make a substitution to evaluate it. Let u = log x. Then du/dx = 1/x, so du = dx/x. Therefore, dx = x du, but since x = e^u, dx = e^u du. Wait, no, that substitution might complicate things. Wait, let&#x27;s try again.

Wait, the integral is ∫ [1/(x log x)] dx. Let me set u = log x. Then du = (1/x) dx. So then, (1/x) dx = du. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫ [1/(x log x)] dx = ∫ [1/(x log x)] * x du = ∫ [1/(log x)] * (1/x) dx = ∫ [1/u] du. Wait, that seems too simple. Let me check.

Wait, if u = log x, then du = (1/x) dx. Then, 1/(x log x) dx = (1/u) du. So the integral becomes ∫ (1/u) du from u = log 2 to u = ∞. So that integral is ∫_{log 2}^∞ (1/u) du. 

But ∫ (1/u) du is log |u| + C, so evaluated from log 2 to infinity:

lim_{t→∞} [log t - log(log 2)] = lim_{t→∞} log t - log(log 2) = ∞ - log(log 2) = ∞.

Therefore, the integral diverges. Hence, by the Integral Test, the series ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(k log k) also diverges. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=2 to n of 1/(k log k) is infinity.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in substitution. Let me go through the integral again step by step.

Given integral ∫_{2}^∞ [1/(x log x)] dx.

Let u = log x. Then du = (1/x) dx. So, [1/(x log x)] dx = [1/(x u)] dx = (1/u) * (1/x dx) = (1/u) du. So, the integral becomes ∫_{u=log 2}^{u=∞} (1/u) du. Which is indeed ∫_{log 2}^∞ (1/u) du = [log u]_{log 2}^∞ = lim_{b→∞} (log b - log(log 2)) = ∞.

Therefore, yes, the integral diverges, hence the series diverges. Therefore, the original limit is infinity.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s another way to see this? Like comparison test. Let&#x27;s see. Since log k grows slower than any polynomial, so 1/(k log k) is asymptotically larger than, say, 1/(k^{1 + ε}) for any ε &gt; 0. But since ∑ 1/k diverges (harmonic series), and 1/(k log k) is smaller than 1/k. Wait, but the integral test shows divergence here. Hmm, but perhaps we can use comparison. Let me think.

Wait, since log k &lt; k^ε for any ε &gt; 0 when k is large enough, so 1/(k log k) &gt; 1/(k^{1 + ε}). But the series ∑ 1/(k^{1 + ε}) converges for any ε &gt; 0. However, our term is larger than a convergent series? Wait, no, if 1/(k log k) &gt; 1/(k^{1 + ε}), then since ∑1/k^{1 + ε} converges, the comparison test would not apply here because the terms are larger than a convergent series. The comparison test says that if a_n ≤ b_n and ∑b_n converges, then ∑a_n converges. Conversely, if a_n ≥ b_n and ∑b_n diverges, then ∑a_n diverges.

But in our case, we have 1/(k log k) is less than 1/k for k ≥2, since log k ≥ log 2 &gt;0. So 1/(k log k) ≤ 1/k * (1/log 2). Wait, but 1/k is the harmonic series, which diverges. So if we compare term-by-term, 1/(k log k) ≤ (1/log 2) * 1/k, but since ∑1/k diverges, we can&#x27;t conclude anything from this comparison. The fact that the terms are smaller than a divergent series doesn&#x27;t help; the series could converge or diverge.

Alternatively, if we can compare 1/(k log k) to a divergent series. But since 1/(k log k) is smaller than 1/k, which diverges, the comparison test is inconclusive here.

So, going back, the Integral Test was the right approach here. The integral ∫_{2}^∞ 1/(x log x) dx diverges, so the series must diverge. Therefore, the limit is infinity.

Alternatively, maybe using Cauchy condensation test. The Cauchy condensation test states that for a non-increasing sequence a_n, the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n converges if and only if ∑_{k=0}^∞ 2^k a_{2^k} converges.

So let&#x27;s apply the Cauchy condensation test here. Our sequence is a_n = 1/(n log n) for n ≥2. Let&#x27;s adjust the index to start at k=1 where a_{2^k} would correspond to n=2,4,8,...

Wait, for k ≥1, 2^k ≥2, so:

Sum_{k=1}^∞ 2^k a_{2^k} = Sum_{k=1}^∞ 2^k * [1/(2^k log 2^k)] = Sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/log 2^k] = Sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/(k log 2)].

Because log 2^k = k log 2. Therefore, this becomes Sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(k log 2) = (1/log 2) Sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k, which is the harmonic series multiplied by a constant. Since the harmonic series diverges, the condensed series diverges, so the original series also diverges by the Cauchy condensation test. Therefore, confirming the earlier result.

Hence, the limit is infinity. Therefore, the answer is that the series diverges to infinity.

**Final Answer**
The limit diverges to infinity, so the answer is \boxed{\infty}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=2}^n \frac{1}{k \log k}\), we need to determine whether the series \(\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{k \log k}\) converges or diverges.

We use the Integral Test, which states that for a positive, continuous, decreasing function \(f(k)\), the series \(\sum_{k=N}^\infty f(k)\) converges if and only if the integral \(\int_{N}^\infty f(x) \, dx\) converges.

Here, the function \(f(k) = \frac{1}{k \log k}\) is positive, continuous, and decreasing for \(k \geq 2\). We compute the integral:

\[
\int_{2}^\infty \frac{1}{x \log x} \, dx
\]

Using the substitution \(u = \log x\), we get \(du = \frac{1}{x} \, dx\). The integral transforms to:

\[
\int_{\log 2}^\infty \frac{1}{u} \, du
\]

This integral evaluates to:

\[
\left[ \log u \right]_{\log 2}^\infty = \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( \log b - \log (\log 2) \right) = \infty
\]

Since the integral diverges, by the Integral Test, the series \(\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{k \log k}\) also diverges.

To confirm, we apply the Cauchy Condensation Test. The condensed series is:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^\infty 2^k \cdot \frac{1}{2^k \log 2^k} = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k \log 2}
\]

This is a constant multiple of the harmonic series, which diverges. Hence, the original series diverges.

Thus, the limit is \(\boxed{\infty}\).          </p>

Alternatively, maybe using Cauchy condensation test. The Cauchy condensation test states that for a non-increasing sequence a_n, the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n converges if and only if ∑_{k=0}^∞ 2^k a_{2^k} converges.

So let&#x27;s apply the Cauchy condensation test here. Our sequence is a_n = 1/(n log n) for n ≥2. Let&#x27;s adjust the index to start at k=1 where a_{2^k} would correspond to n=2,4,8,...

Wait, for k ≥1, 2^k ≥2, so:

Sum_{k=1}^∞ 2^k a_{2^k} = Sum_{k=1}^∞ 2^k * [1/(2^k log 2^k)] = Sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/log 2^k] = Sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/(k log 2)].

Because log 2^k = k log 2. Therefore, this becomes Sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(k log 2) = (1/log 2) Sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k, which is the harmonic series multiplied by a constant. Since the harmonic series diverges, the condensed series diverges, so the original series also diverges by the Cauchy condensation test. Therefore, confirming the earlier result.

Hence, the limit is infinity. Therefore, the answer is that the series diverges to infinity.

**Final Answer**
The limit diverges to infinity, so the answer is \boxed{\infty}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=2}^n \frac{1}{k \log k}\), we need to determine whether the series \(\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{k \log k}\) converges or diverges.

We use the Integral Test, which states that for a positive, continuous, decreasing function \(f(k)\), the series \(\sum_{k=N}^\infty f(k)\) converges if and only if the integral \(\int_{N}^\infty f(x) \, dx\) converges.

Here, the function \(f(k) = \frac{1}{k \log k}\) is positive, continuous, and decreasing for \(k \geq 2\). We compute the integral:

\[
\int_{2}^\infty \frac{1}{x \log x} \, dx
\]

Using the substitution \(u = \log x\), we get \(du = \frac{1}{x} \, dx\). The integral transforms to:

\[
\int_{\log 2}^\infty \frac{1}{u} \, du
\]

This integral evaluates to:

\[
\left[ \log u \right]_{\log 2}^\infty = \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( \log b - \log (\log 2) \right) = \infty
\]

Since the integral diverges, by the Integral Test, the series \(\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{k \log k}\) also diverges.

To confirm, we apply the Cauchy Condensation Test. The condensed series is:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^\infty 2^k \cdot \frac{1}{2^k \log 2^k} = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k \log 2}
\]

This is a constant multiple of the harmonic series, which diverges. Hence, the original series diverges.

Thus, the limit is \(\boxed{\infty}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to find the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=2 to n of 1/(k log k). Hmm, let&#x27;s start by writing that out properly. The expression is:

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=2}^n \frac{1}{k \log k}
\]

Alright, so this is an infinite series, and I need to determine whether it converges or diverges. If it converges, the limit will be a finite number; if it diverges, the limit will be infinity or doesn&#x27;t exist. 

First, let me recall some tests for convergence of series. The Integral Test comes to mind. The Integral Test says that if f(k) is a positive, continuous, decreasing function for all k ≥ N, then the series ∑_{k=N}^∞ f(k) converges if and only if the integral ∫_{N}^∞ f(x) dx converges.

So here, the function f(k) = 1/(k log k). Let&#x27;s check if it&#x27;s positive, continuous, and decreasing. For k ≥ 2, 1/(k log k) is definitely positive. The natural logarithm log k is defined and continuous for k &gt; 0, so log k is continuous for k ≥ 2. Then 1/(k log k) is also continuous. 

Is it decreasing? Let&#x27;s take the derivative of f(x) = 1/(x log x) with respect to x to check if it&#x27;s decreasing. Let me compute f&#x27;(x):

f(x) = (x log x)^{-1}

Using the chain rule:

f&#x27;(x) = -1 * (x log x)^{-2} * (d/dx [x log x])

Compute derivative of x log x:

d/dx [x log x] = log x + x*(1/x) = log x + 1

Therefore,

f&#x27;(x) = - (log x + 1) / (x log x)^2

For x ≥ 2, log x ≥ log 2 ≈ 0.693 &gt; 0, so log x + 1 &gt; 0. Thus, the numerator is positive, and the denominator is always positive since squared. Therefore, f&#x27;(x) is negative for x ≥ 2, which means f(x) is indeed decreasing.

Therefore, all the conditions for the Integral Test are satisfied. So the convergence of the series ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(k log k) is equivalent to the convergence of the integral ∫_{2}^∞ 1/(x log x) dx.

Let me compute that integral. Let&#x27;s make a substitution to evaluate it. Let u = log x. Then du/dx = 1/x, so du = dx/x. Therefore, dx = x du, but since x = e^u, dx = e^u du. Wait, no, that substitution might complicate things. Wait, let&#x27;s try again.

Wait, the integral is ∫ [1/(x log x)] dx. Let me set u = log x. Then du = (1/x) dx. So then, (1/x) dx = du. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫ [1/(x log x)] dx = ∫ [1/(x log x)] * x du = ∫ [1/(log x)] * (1/x) dx = ∫ [1/u] du. Wait, that seems too simple. Let me check.

Wait, if u = log x, then du = (1/x) dx. Then, 1/(x log x) dx = (1/u) du. So the integral becomes ∫ (1/u) du from u = log 2 to u = ∞. So that integral is ∫_{log 2}^∞ (1/u) du. 

But ∫ (1/u) du is log |u| + C, so evaluated from log 2 to infinity:

lim_{t→∞} [log t - log(log 2)] = lim_{t→∞} log t - log(log 2) = ∞ - log(log 2) = ∞.

Therefore, the integral diverges. Hence, by the Integral Test, the series ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(k log k) also diverges. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=2 to n of 1/(k log k) is infinity.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in substitution. Let me go through the integral again step by step.

Given integral ∫_{2}^∞ [1/(x log x)] dx.

Let u = log x. Then du = (1/x) dx. So, [1/(x log x)] dx = [1/(x u)] dx = (1/u) * (1/x dx) = (1/u) du. So, the integral becomes ∫_{u=log 2}^{u=∞} (1/u) du. Which is indeed ∫_{log 2}^∞ (1/u) du = [log u]_{log 2}^∞ = lim_{b→∞} (log b - log(log 2)) = ∞.

Therefore, yes, the integral diverges, hence the series diverges. Therefore, the original limit is infinity.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s another way to see this? Like comparison test. Let&#x27;s see. Since log k grows slower than any polynomial, so 1/(k log k) is asymptotically larger than, say, 1/(k^{1 + ε}) for any ε &gt; 0. But since ∑ 1/k diverges (harmonic series), and 1/(k log k) is smaller than 1/k. Wait, but the integral test shows divergence here. Hmm, but perhaps we can use comparison. Let me think.

Wait, since log k &lt; k^ε for any ε &gt; 0 when k is large enough, so 1/(k log k) &gt; 1/(k^{1 + ε}). But the series ∑ 1/(k^{1 + ε}) converges for any ε &gt; 0. However, our term is larger than a convergent series? Wait, no, if 1/(k log k) &gt; 1/(k^{1 + ε}), then since ∑1/k^{1 + ε} converges, the comparison test would not apply here because the terms are larger than a convergent series. The comparison test says that if a_n ≤ b_n and ∑b_n converges, then ∑a_n converges. Conversely, if a_n ≥ b_n and ∑b_n diverges, then ∑a_n diverges.

But in our case, we have 1/(k log k) is less than 1/k for k ≥2, since log k ≥ log 2 &gt;0. So 1/(k log k) ≤ 1/k * (1/log 2). Wait, but 1/k is the harmonic series, which diverges. So if we compare term-by-term, 1/(k log k) ≤ (1/log 2) * 1/k, but since ∑1/k diverges, we can&#x27;t conclude anything from this comparison. The fact that the terms are smaller than a divergent series doesn&#x27;t help; the series could converge or diverge.

Alternatively, if we can compare 1/(k log k) to a divergent series. But since 1/(k log k) is smaller than 1/k, which diverges, the comparison test is inconclusive here.

Sum_{k=1}^∞ 2^k a_{2^k} = Sum_{k=1}^∞ 2^k * [1/(2^k log 2^k)] = Sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/log 2^k] = Sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/(k log 2)].

Because log 2^k = k log 2. Therefore, this becomes Sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(k log 2) = (1/log 2) Sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k, which is the harmonic series multiplied by a constant. Since the harmonic series diverges, the condensed series diverges, so the original series also diverges by the Cauchy condensation test. Therefore, confirming the earlier result.

Wait, if u = log x, then du = (1/x) dx. Then, 1/(x log x) dx = (1/u) du. So the integral becomes ∫ (1/u) du from u = log 2 to u = ∞. So that integral is ∫_{log 2}^∞ (1/u) du. 

But ∫ (1/u) du is log |u| + C, so evaluated from log 2 to infinity:

lim_{t→∞} [log t - log(log 2)] = lim_{t→∞} log t - log(log 2) = ∞ - log(log 2) = ∞.

Therefore, the integral diverges. Hence, by the Integral Test, the series ∑_{k=2}^∞ 1/(k log k) also diverges. Therefore, the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=2 to n of 1/(k log k) is infinity.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn&#x27;t make a mistake in substitution. Let me go through the integral again step by step.

Given integral ∫_{2}^∞ [1/(x log x)] dx.

Let u = log x. Then du = (1/x) dx. So, [1/(x log x)] dx = [1/(x u)] dx = (1/u) * (1/x dx) = (1/u) du. So, the integral becomes ∫_{u=log 2}^{u=∞} (1/u) du. Which is indeed ∫_{log 2}^∞ (1/u) du = [log u]_{log 2}^∞ = lim_{b→∞} (log b - log(log 2)) = ∞.

Therefore, yes, the integral diverges, hence the series diverges. Therefore, the original limit is infinity.

Alternatively, maybe there&#x27;s another way to see this? Like comparison test. Let&#x27;s see. Since log k grows slower than any polynomial, so 1/(k log k) is asymptotically larger than, say, 1/(k^{1 + ε}) for any ε &gt; 0. But since ∑ 1/k diverges (harmonic series), and 1/(k log k) is smaller than 1/k. Wait, but the integral test shows divergence here. Hmm, but perhaps we can use comparison. Let me think.

Wait, since log k &lt; k^ε for any ε &gt; 0 when k is large enough, so 1/(k log k) &gt; 1/(k^{1 + ε}). But the series ∑ 1/(k^{1 + ε}) converges for any ε &gt; 0. However, our term is larger than a convergent series? Wait, no, if 1/(k log k) &gt; 1/(k^{1 + ε}), then since ∑1/k^{1 + ε} converges, the comparison test would not apply here because the terms are larger than a convergent series. The comparison test says that if a_n ≤ b_n and ∑b_n converges, then ∑a_n converges. Conversely, if a_n ≥ b_n and ∑b_n diverges, then ∑a_n diverges.

But in our case, we have 1/(k log k) is less than 1/k for k ≥2, since log k ≥ log 2 &gt;0. So 1/(k log k) ≤ 1/k * (1/log 2). Wait, but 1/k is the harmonic series, which diverges. So if we compare term-by-term, 1/(k log k) ≤ (1/log 2) * 1/k, but since ∑1/k diverges, we can&#x27;t conclude anything from this comparison. The fact that the terms are smaller than a divergent series doesn&#x27;t help; the series could converge or diverge.

Alternatively, if we can compare 1/(k log k) to a divergent series. But since 1/(k log k) is smaller than 1/k, which diverges, the comparison test is inconclusive here.

So, going back, the Integral Test was the right approach here. The integral ∫_{2}^∞ 1/(x log x) dx diverges, so the series must diverge. Therefore, the limit is infinity.

Alternatively, maybe using Cauchy condensation test. The Cauchy condensation test states that for a non-increasing sequence a_n, the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n converges if and only if ∑_{k=0}^∞ 2^k a_{2^k} converges.

So let&#x27;s apply the Cauchy condensation test here. Our sequence is a_n = 1/(n log n) for n ≥2. Let&#x27;s adjust the index to start at k=1 where a_{2^k} would correspond to n=2,4,8,...

Wait, for k ≥1, 2^k ≥2, so:

Sum_{k=1}^∞ 2^k a_{2^k} = Sum_{k=1}^∞ 2^k * [1/(2^k log 2^k)] = Sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/log 2^k] = Sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/(k log 2)].

Because log 2^k = k log 2. Therefore, this becomes Sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(k log 2) = (1/log 2) Sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k, which is the harmonic series multiplied by a constant. Since the harmonic series diverges, the condensed series diverges, so the original series also diverges by the Cauchy condensation test. Therefore, confirming the earlier result.

Hence, the limit is infinity. Therefore, the answer is that the series diverges to infinity.

**Final Answer**
The limit diverges to infinity, so the answer is \boxed{\infty}.
&lt;/think&gt;

To evaluate the limit \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=2}^n \frac{1}{k \log k}\), we need to determine whether the series \(\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{k \log k}\) converges or diverges.

We use the Integral Test, which states that for a positive, continuous, decreasing function \(f(k)\), the series \(\sum_{k=N}^\infty f(k)\) converges if and only if the integral \(\int_{N}^\infty f(x) \, dx\) converges.

Here, the function \(f(k) = \frac{1}{k \log k}\) is positive, continuous, and decreasing for \(k \geq 2\). We compute the integral:

\[
\int_{2}^\infty \frac{1}{x \log x} \, dx
\]

Using the substitution \(u = \log x\), we get \(du = \frac{1}{x} \, dx\). The integral transforms to:

\[
\int_{\log 2}^\infty \frac{1}{u} \, du
\]

This integral evaluates to:

\[
\left[ \log u \right]_{\log 2}^\infty = \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( \log b - \log (\log 2) \right) = \infty
\]

Since the integral diverges, by the Integral Test, the series \(\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{k \log k}\) also diverges.

To confirm, we apply the Cauchy Condensation Test. The condensed series is:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^\infty 2^k \cdot \frac{1}{2^k \log 2^k} = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k \log 2}
\]

This is a constant multiple of the harmonic series, which diverges. Hence, the original series diverges.

Thus, the limit is \(\boxed{\infty}\).          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: The line passes through $\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix},$ so its direction vector is proportional to
\[\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.\]To get an $x$-coordinate of 2, we can multiply this vector by the scalar $\frac{2}{3}.$  This gives us
\[\frac{2}{3} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 4/3 \end{pmatrix}.\]Therefore, $b = \boxed{\frac{4}{3}}.$          </p>

          <p class="lt-p">
Reference Answer: The line passes through $\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix},$ so its direction vector is proportional to
\[\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.\]To get an $x$-coordinate of 2, we can multiply this vector by the scalar $\frac{2}{3}.$  This gives us
\[\frac{2}{3} \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 4/3 \end{pmatrix}.\]Therefore, $b = \boxed{\frac{4}{3}}.$          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem here about vector spaces and quotient spaces. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

First, we have two vector spaces, X and Y. There&#x27;s a surjective map f from X to Y. Then there&#x27;s a subspace M of the kernel of f, so M is contained in ker(f). The quotient space X/M is isomorphic to Y under the induced map from f. The question is whether M must actually be equal to the kernel of f. So, do we have M = ker(f), or is there a possibility that M is a proper subspace of ker(f) even when X/M is isomorphic to Y?

Hmm. Let me recall some linear algebra. If f: X → Y is a linear map, then the First Isomorphism Theorem states that X/ker(f) is isomorphic to im(f). Since f is surjective, im(f) = Y. So by the First Isomorphism Theorem, X/ker(f) ≅ Y. 

But here, we&#x27;re given that X/M is isomorphic to Y via the induced map from f, and M is a subspace of ker(f). The problem is asking if M must then be equal to ker(f). 

Let me think. Suppose M is a proper subspace of ker(f). Then the quotient X/M would be a larger space than X/ker(f), right? Because quotienting by a smaller subspace gives a larger quotient space. Wait, no. Wait, actually, if M is contained in ker(f), then the quotient X/M has equivalence classes that are coarser than those in X/ker(f). Wait, maybe not. Let me recall how quotient spaces work.

If you have a subspace N contained in another subspace K of X, then X/K is a quotient of X/N. Specifically, there&#x27;s a natural surjective map from X/N to X/K. So if M is contained in ker(f), then X/M maps onto X/ker(f). But since X/ker(f) is isomorphic to Y, and X/M is also isomorphic to Y, that would require that the surjective map from X/M to X/ker(f) is an isomorphism. But a surjective linear map between vector spaces of the same dimension is an isomorphism. So if X/M and X/ker(f) have the same dimension, then the natural projection from X/M to X/ker(f) is an isomorphism. But when does this happen?

Let&#x27;s put dimensions into this. Suppose X is finite-dimensional for simplicity. Let dim(X) = n, dim(ker(f)) = k, so dim(Y) = n - k by the First Isomorphism Theorem. Now, if M is a subspace of ker(f), then dim(M) = m ≤ k. Then dim(X/M) = n - m. But we are given that X/M is isomorphic to Y, which has dimension n - k. Therefore, n - m = n - k, which implies that m = k. Therefore, dim(M) = dim(ker(f)), and since M is a subspace of ker(f), they must be equal. Therefore, in finite-dimensional cases, M must be equal to ker(f).

But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify finite-dimensionality. Hmm. So does this hold in infinite dimensions as well? Wait, in infinite-dimensional spaces, dimensions are a bit trickier. But maybe we can still argue based on the isomorphism. If there is an isomorphism between X/M and Y induced by f, then the induced map must be both surjective and injective. Let&#x27;s think about the induced map. 

Given f: X → Y is surjective with M ⊂ ker(f), the induced map f&#x27;: X/M → Y is defined by f&#x27;([x]) = f(x). This is well-defined because if [x] = [y], then x - y ∈ M, and since M ⊂ ker(f), f(x - y) = 0, so f(x) = f(y). So f&#x27; is well-defined. 

Now, since f is surjective, f&#x27; is also surjective: for any y ∈ Y, there exists x ∈ X such that f(x) = y, hence f&#x27;([x]) = y. 

If f&#x27; is an isomorphism, then it must also be injective. The kernel of f&#x27; is { [x] | f&#x27;(x) = 0 } = { [x] | f(x) = 0 } = { [x] | x ∈ ker(f) }. But in the quotient X/M, the kernel of f&#x27; would be ker(f)/M. But since f&#x27; is injective, its kernel must be trivial. Therefore, ker(f)/M = {0}, which implies that ker(f) = M. 

Ah, right! Because if the kernel of f&#x27; is trivial, then ker(f)/M must be the zero subspace in X/M, which means that every element of ker(f) is in M. Hence, ker(f) ⊂ M. But we already know M ⊂ ker(f), so equality follows. Therefore, regardless of the dimension, M must equal ker(f). 

So even in infinite dimensions, this argument holds because we&#x27;re using the isomorphism directly. Since the induced map f&#x27; is injective (as an isomorphism), its kernel must be zero, which forces ker(f) = M. 

Therefore, the answer should be that M must equal ker(f). So the statement is true; we can&#x27;t have a proper subspace M of ker(f) such that X/M is isomorphic to Y via the induced map. 

Let me check if there&#x27;s a possible counterexample. Suppose someone says, take X = Y ⊕ ker(f), and then take M to be a subspace of ker(f). Then X/M = Y ⊕ (ker(f)/M). But if we have an isomorphism X/M ≅ Y, then ker(f)/M must be zero, hence ker(f) = M. So in this case, you can&#x27;t have a non-trivial quotient. So even in this case, M must be equal to ker(f). 

Another angle: Let’s think about the natural projection π: X → X/M. The induced map f&#x27;: X/M → Y is an isomorphism. Then f = f&#x27; ◦ π. Since f&#x27; is an isomorphism, it&#x27;s bijective, so the kernel of f is exactly the kernel of π. But the kernel of π is M. Therefore, ker(f) = M. 

Wait, that&#x27;s a succinct way to see it. Since f factors through π via the isomorphism f&#x27;, the kernel of f must equal the kernel of π, which is M. Hence, ker(f) = M. 

Therefore, regardless of how you approach it, the conclusion is that M must equal ker(f). So the answer is that M is equal to ker(f), hence the statement is true.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{M = \ker f}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given two vector spaces \(X\) and \(Y\) with a surjective linear map \(f: X \rightarrow Y\), and a subspace \(M\) of the kernel of \(f\) such that the quotient space \(X/M\) is isomorphic to \(Y\) under the induced map from \(f\), we need to prove or disprove that \(M\) is equal to the kernel of \(f\).

1. **First Isomorphism Theorem**: By the First Isomorphism Theorem, \(X / \ker(f) \cong Y\) because \(f\) is surjective. This implies \(\dim(X / \ker(f)) = \dim(Y)\).

2. **Induced Map**: The induced map \(f&#x27;: X/M \rightarrow Y\) is well-defined and surjective since \(f\) is surjective. Given \(X/M \cong Y\), \(f&#x27;\) must also be injective.

3. **Kernel of the Induced Map**: The kernel of \(f&#x27;\) consists of equivalence classes \([x]\) such that \(f(x) = 0\). This kernel is \(\ker(f)/M\). Since \(f&#x27;\) is injective, its kernel must be trivial, implying \(\ker(f)/M = \{0\}\).

4. **Equality of Subspaces**: From \(\ker(f)/M = \{0\}\), it follows that every element of \(\ker(f)\) is in \(M\). Since \(M \subset \ker(f)\) by hypothesis, we conclude \(M = \ker(f)\).

Thus, the subspace \(M\) must be equal to the kernel of \(f\).

So if M is contained in ker(f), then X/M maps onto X/ker(f). But since X/ker(f) is isomorphic to Y, and X/M is also isomorphic to Y, that would require that the surjective map from X/M to X/ker(f) is an isomorphism. But a surjective linear map between vector spaces of the same dimension is an isomorphism. So if X/M and X/ker(f) have the same dimension, then the natural projection from X/M to X/ker(f) is an isomorphism. But when does this happen?

Let&#x27;s put dimensions into this. Suppose X is finite-dimensional for simplicity. Let dim(X) = n, dim(ker(f)) = k, so dim(Y) = n - k by the First Isomorphism Theorem. Now, if M is a subspace of ker(f), then dim(M) = m ≤ k. Then dim(X/M) = n - m. But we are given that X/M is isomorphic to Y, which has dimension n - k. Therefore, n - m = n - k, which implies that m = k. Therefore, dim(M) = dim(ker(f)), and since M is a subspace of ker(f), they must be equal. Therefore, in finite-dimensional cases, M must be equal to ker(f).

But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify finite-dimensionality. Hmm. So does this hold in infinite dimensions as well? Wait, in infinite-dimensional spaces, dimensions are a bit trickier. But maybe we can still argue based on the isomorphism. If there is an isomorphism between X/M and Y induced by f, then the induced map must be both surjective and injective. Let&#x27;s think about the induced map. 

Given f: X → Y is surjective with M ⊂ ker(f), the induced map f&#x27;: X/M → Y is defined by f&#x27;([x]) = f(x). This is well-defined because if [x] = [y], then x - y ∈ M, and since M ⊂ ker(f), f(x - y) = 0, so f(x) = f(y). So f&#x27; is well-defined. 

Now, since f is surjective, f&#x27; is also surjective: for any y ∈ Y, there exists x ∈ X such that f(x) = y, hence f&#x27;([x]) = y. 

If f&#x27; is an isomorphism, then it must also be injective. The kernel of f&#x27; is { [x] | f&#x27;(x) = 0 } = { [x] | f(x) = 0 } = { [x] | x ∈ ker(f) }. But in the quotient X/M, the kernel of f&#x27; would be ker(f)/M. But since f&#x27; is injective, its kernel must be trivial. Therefore, ker(f)/M = {0}, which implies that ker(f) = M. 

Ah, right! Because if the kernel of f&#x27; is trivial, then ker(f)/M must be the zero subspace in X/M, which means that every element of ker(f) is in M. Hence, ker(f) ⊂ M. But we already know M ⊂ ker(f), so equality follows. Therefore, regardless of the dimension, M must equal ker(f). 

So even in infinite dimensions, this argument holds because we&#x27;re using the isomorphism directly. Since the induced map f&#x27; is injective (as an isomorphism), its kernel must be zero, which forces ker(f) = M. 

Therefore, the answer should be that M must equal ker(f). So the statement is true; we can&#x27;t have a proper subspace M of ker(f) such that X/M is isomorphic to Y via the induced map. 

Let me check if there&#x27;s a possible counterexample. Suppose someone says, take X = Y ⊕ ker(f), and then take M to be a subspace of ker(f). Then X/M = Y ⊕ (ker(f)/M). But if we have an isomorphism X/M ≅ Y, then ker(f)/M must be zero, hence ker(f) = M. So in this case, you can&#x27;t have a non-trivial quotient. So even in this case, M must be equal to ker(f). 

Another angle: Let’s think about the natural projection π: X → X/M. The induced map f&#x27;: X/M → Y is an isomorphism. Then f = f&#x27; ◦ π. Since f&#x27; is an isomorphism, it&#x27;s bijective, so the kernel of f is exactly the kernel of π. But the kernel of π is M. Therefore, ker(f) = M. 

Wait, that&#x27;s a succinct way to see it. Since f factors through π via the isomorphism f&#x27;, the kernel of f must equal the kernel of π, which is M. Hence, ker(f) = M. 

Therefore, regardless of how you approach it, the conclusion is that M must equal ker(f). So the answer is that M is equal to ker(f), hence the statement is true.

\boxed{M = \ker f}

Given two vector spaces \(X\) and \(Y\) with a surjective linear map \(f: X \rightarrow Y\), and a subspace \(M\) of the kernel of \(f\) such that the quotient space \(X/M\) is isomorphic to \(Y\) under the induced map from \(f\), we need to prove or disprove that \(M\) is equal to the kernel of \(f\).

1. **First Isomorphism Theorem**: By the First Isomorphism Theorem, \(X / \ker(f) \cong Y\) because \(f\) is surjective. This implies \(\dim(X / \ker(f)) = \dim(Y)\).

2. **Induced Map**: The induced map \(f&#x27;: X/M \rightarrow Y\) is well-defined and surjective since \(f\) is surjective. Given \(X/M \cong Y\), \(f&#x27;\) must also be injective.

3. **Kernel of the Induced Map**: The kernel of \(f&#x27;\) consists of equivalence classes \([x]\) such that \(f(x) = 0\). This kernel is \(\ker(f)/M\). Since \(f&#x27;\) is injective, its kernel must be trivial, implying \(\ker(f)/M = \{0\}\).

4. **Equality of Subspaces**: From \(\ker(f)/M = \{0\}\), it follows that every element of \(\ker(f)\) is in \(M\). Since \(M \subset \ker(f)\) by hypothesis, we conclude \(M = \ker(f)\).

Thus, the subspace \(M\) must be equal to the kernel of \(f\).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem here about vector spaces and quotient spaces. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

First, we have two vector spaces, X and Y. There&#x27;s a surjective map f from X to Y. Then there&#x27;s a subspace M of the kernel of f, so M is contained in ker(f). The quotient space X/M is isomorphic to Y under the induced map from f. The question is whether M must actually be equal to the kernel of f. So, do we have M = ker(f), or is there a possibility that M is a proper subspace of ker(f) even when X/M is isomorphic to Y?

Hmm. Let me recall some linear algebra. If f: X → Y is a linear map, then the First Isomorphism Theorem states that X/ker(f) is isomorphic to im(f). Since f is surjective, im(f) = Y. So by the First Isomorphism Theorem, X/ker(f) ≅ Y. 

But here, we&#x27;re given that X/M is isomorphic to Y via the induced map from f, and M is a subspace of ker(f). The problem is asking if M must then be equal to ker(f). 

Let me think. Suppose M is a proper subspace of ker(f). Then the quotient X/M would be a larger space than X/ker(f), right? Because quotienting by a smaller subspace gives a larger quotient space. Wait, no. Wait, actually, if M is contained in ker(f), then the quotient X/M has equivalence classes that are coarser than those in X/ker(f). Wait, maybe not. Let me recall how quotient spaces work.

First, we have two vector spaces, X and Y. There&#x27;s a surjective map f from X to Y. Then there&#x27;s a subspace M of the kernel of f, so M is contained in ker(f). The quotient space X/M is isomorphic to Y under the induced map from f. The question is whether M must actually be equal to the kernel of f. So, do we have M = ker(f), or is there a possibility that M is a proper subspace of ker(f) even when X/M is isomorphic to Y?

Hmm. Let me recall some linear algebra. If f: X → Y is a linear map, then the First Isomorphism Theorem states that X/ker(f) is isomorphic to im(f). Since f is surjective, im(f) = Y. So by the First Isomorphism Theorem, X/ker(f) ≅ Y. 

But here, we&#x27;re given that X/M is isomorphic to Y via the induced map from f, and M is a subspace of ker(f). The problem is asking if M must then be equal to ker(f). 

Let me think. Suppose M is a proper subspace of ker(f). Then the quotient X/M would be a larger space than X/ker(f), right? Because quotienting by a smaller subspace gives a larger quotient space. Wait, no. Wait, actually, if M is contained in ker(f), then the quotient X/M has equivalence classes that are coarser than those in X/ker(f). Wait, maybe not. Let me recall how quotient spaces work.

If you have a subspace N contained in another subspace K of X, then X/K is a quotient of X/N. Specifically, there&#x27;s a natural surjective map from X/N to X/K. So if M is contained in ker(f), then X/M maps onto X/ker(f). But since X/ker(f) is isomorphic to Y, and X/M is also isomorphic to Y, that would require that the surjective map from X/M to X/ker(f) is an isomorphism. But a surjective linear map between vector spaces of the same dimension is an isomorphism. So if X/M and X/ker(f) have the same dimension, then the natural projection from X/M to X/ker(f) is an isomorphism. But when does this happen?

Let&#x27;s put dimensions into this. Suppose X is finite-dimensional for simplicity. Let dim(X) = n, dim(ker(f)) = k, so dim(Y) = n - k by the First Isomorphism Theorem. Now, if M is a subspace of ker(f), then dim(M) = m ≤ k. Then dim(X/M) = n - m. But we are given that X/M is isomorphic to Y, which has dimension n - k. Therefore, n - m = n - k, which implies that m = k. Therefore, dim(M) = dim(ker(f)), and since M is a subspace of ker(f), they must be equal. Therefore, in finite-dimensional cases, M must be equal to ker(f).

But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify finite-dimensionality. Hmm. So does this hold in infinite dimensions as well? Wait, in infinite-dimensional spaces, dimensions are a bit trickier. But maybe we can still argue based on the isomorphism. If there is an isomorphism between X/M and Y induced by f, then the induced map must be both surjective and injective. Let&#x27;s think about the induced map. 

Given f: X → Y is surjective with M ⊂ ker(f), the induced map f&#x27;: X/M → Y is defined by f&#x27;([x]) = f(x). This is well-defined because if [x] = [y], then x - y ∈ M, and since M ⊂ ker(f), f(x - y) = 0, so f(x) = f(y). So f&#x27; is well-defined. 

Now, since f is surjective, f&#x27; is also surjective: for any y ∈ Y, there exists x ∈ X such that f(x) = y, hence f&#x27;([x]) = y. 

If f&#x27; is an isomorphism, then it must also be injective. The kernel of f&#x27; is { [x] | f&#x27;(x) = 0 } = { [x] | f(x) = 0 } = { [x] | x ∈ ker(f) }. But in the quotient X/M, the kernel of f&#x27; would be ker(f)/M. But since f&#x27; is injective, its kernel must be trivial. Therefore, ker(f)/M = {0}, which implies that ker(f) = M. 

Ah, right! Because if the kernel of f&#x27; is trivial, then ker(f)/M must be the zero subspace in X/M, which means that every element of ker(f) is in M. Hence, ker(f) ⊂ M. But we already know M ⊂ ker(f), so equality follows. Therefore, regardless of the dimension, M must equal ker(f). 

So even in infinite dimensions, this argument holds because we&#x27;re using the isomorphism directly. Since the induced map f&#x27; is injective (as an isomorphism), its kernel must be zero, which forces ker(f) = M. 

Therefore, the answer should be that M must equal ker(f). So the statement is true; we can&#x27;t have a proper subspace M of ker(f) such that X/M is isomorphic to Y via the induced map. 

Let me check if there&#x27;s a possible counterexample. Suppose someone says, take X = Y ⊕ ker(f), and then take M to be a subspace of ker(f). Then X/M = Y ⊕ (ker(f)/M). But if we have an isomorphism X/M ≅ Y, then ker(f)/M must be zero, hence ker(f) = M. So in this case, you can&#x27;t have a non-trivial quotient. So even in this case, M must be equal to ker(f). 

Another angle: Let’s think about the natural projection π: X → X/M. The induced map f&#x27;: X/M → Y is an isomorphism. Then f = f&#x27; ◦ π. Since f&#x27; is an isomorphism, it&#x27;s bijective, so the kernel of f is exactly the kernel of π. But the kernel of π is M. Therefore, ker(f) = M. 

Wait, that&#x27;s a succinct way to see it. Since f factors through π via the isomorphism f&#x27;, the kernel of f must equal the kernel of π, which is M. Hence, ker(f) = M. 

Therefore, regardless of how you approach it, the conclusion is that M must equal ker(f). So the answer is that M is equal to ker(f), hence the statement is true.

\boxed{M = \ker f}

Given two vector spaces \(X\) and \(Y\) with a surjective linear map \(f: X \rightarrow Y\), and a subspace \(M\) of the kernel of \(f\) such that the quotient space \(X/M\) is isomorphic to \(Y\) under the induced map from \(f\), we need to prove or disprove that \(M\) is equal to the kernel of \(f\).

1. **First Isomorphism Theorem**: By the First Isomorphism Theorem, \(X / \ker(f) \cong Y\) because \(f\) is surjective. This implies \(\dim(X / \ker(f)) = \dim(Y)\).

2. **Induced Map**: The induced map \(f&#x27;: X/M \rightarrow Y\) is well-defined and surjective since \(f\) is surjective. Given \(X/M \cong Y\), \(f&#x27;\) must also be injective.

3. **Kernel of the Induced Map**: The kernel of \(f&#x27;\) consists of equivalence classes \([x]\) such that \(f(x) = 0\). This kernel is \(\ker(f)/M\). Since \(f&#x27;\) is injective, its kernel must be trivial, implying \(\ker(f)/M = \{0\}\).

4. **Equality of Subspaces**: From \(\ker(f)/M = \{0\}\), it follows that every element of \(\ker(f)\) is in \(M\). Since \(M \subset \ker(f)\) by hypothesis, we conclude \(M = \ker(f)\).

Thus, the subspace \(M\) must be equal to the kernel of \(f\).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem here about vector spaces and quotient spaces. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

First, we have two vector spaces, X and Y. There&#x27;s a surjective map f from X to Y. Then there&#x27;s a subspace M of the kernel of f, so M is contained in ker(f). The quotient space X/M is isomorphic to Y under the induced map from f. The question is whether M must actually be equal to the kernel of f. So, do we have M = ker(f), or is there a possibility that M is a proper subspace of ker(f) even when X/M is isomorphic to Y?

Hmm. Let me recall some linear algebra. If f: X → Y is a linear map, then the First Isomorphism Theorem states that X/ker(f) is isomorphic to im(f). Since f is surjective, im(f) = Y. So by the First Isomorphism Theorem, X/ker(f) ≅ Y. 

But here, we&#x27;re given that X/M is isomorphic to Y via the induced map from f, and M is a subspace of ker(f). The problem is asking if M must then be equal to ker(f). 

Let me think. Suppose M is a proper subspace of ker(f). Then the quotient X/M would be a larger space than X/ker(f), right? Because quotienting by a smaller subspace gives a larger quotient space. Wait, no. Wait, actually, if M is contained in ker(f), then the quotient X/M has equivalence classes that are coarser than those in X/ker(f). Wait, maybe not. Let me recall how quotient spaces work.

If you have a subspace N contained in another subspace K of X, then X/K is a quotient of X/N. Specifically, there&#x27;s a natural surjective map from X/N to X/K. So if M is contained in ker(f), then X/M maps onto X/ker(f). But since X/ker(f) is isomorphic to Y, and X/M is also isomorphic to Y, that would require that the surjective map from X/M to X/ker(f) is an isomorphism. But a surjective linear map between vector spaces of the same dimension is an isomorphism. So if X/M and X/ker(f) have the same dimension, then the natural projection from X/M to X/ker(f) is an isomorphism. But when does this happen?

Let&#x27;s put dimensions into this. Suppose X is finite-dimensional for simplicity. Let dim(X) = n, dim(ker(f)) = k, so dim(Y) = n - k by the First Isomorphism Theorem. Now, if M is a subspace of ker(f), then dim(M) = m ≤ k. Then dim(X/M) = n - m. But we are given that X/M is isomorphic to Y, which has dimension n - k. Therefore, n - m = n - k, which implies that m = k. Therefore, dim(M) = dim(ker(f)), and since M is a subspace of ker(f), they must be equal. Therefore, in finite-dimensional cases, M must be equal to ker(f).

But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify finite-dimensionality. Hmm. So does this hold in infinite dimensions as well? Wait, in infinite-dimensional spaces, dimensions are a bit trickier. But maybe we can still argue based on the isomorphism. If there is an isomorphism between X/M and Y induced by f, then the induced map must be both surjective and injective. Let&#x27;s think about the induced map. 

Given f: X → Y is surjective with M ⊂ ker(f), the induced map f&#x27;: X/M → Y is defined by f&#x27;([x]) = f(x). This is well-defined because if [x] = [y], then x - y ∈ M, and since M ⊂ ker(f), f(x - y) = 0, so f(x) = f(y). So f&#x27; is well-defined. 

Now, since f is surjective, f&#x27; is also surjective: for any y ∈ Y, there exists x ∈ X such that f(x) = y, hence f&#x27;([x]) = y. 

If f&#x27; is an isomorphism, then it must also be injective. The kernel of f&#x27; is { [x] | f&#x27;(x) = 0 } = { [x] | f(x) = 0 } = { [x] | x ∈ ker(f) }. But in the quotient X/M, the kernel of f&#x27; would be ker(f)/M. But since f&#x27; is injective, its kernel must be trivial. Therefore, ker(f)/M = {0}, which implies that ker(f) = M. 

Ah, right! Because if the kernel of f&#x27; is trivial, then ker(f)/M must be the zero subspace in X/M, which means that every element of ker(f) is in M. Hence, ker(f) ⊂ M. But we already know M ⊂ ker(f), so equality follows. Therefore, regardless of the dimension, M must equal ker(f). 

So even in infinite dimensions, this argument holds because we&#x27;re using the isomorphism directly. Since the induced map f&#x27; is injective (as an isomorphism), its kernel must be zero, which forces ker(f) = M. 

Therefore, the answer should be that M must equal ker(f). So the statement is true; we can&#x27;t have a proper subspace M of ker(f) such that X/M is isomorphic to Y via the induced map.

First, we have two vector spaces, X and Y. There&#x27;s a surjective map f from X to Y. Then there&#x27;s a subspace M of the kernel of f, so M is contained in ker(f). The quotient space X/M is isomorphic to Y under the induced map from f. The question is whether M must actually be equal to the kernel of f. So, do we have M = ker(f), or is there a possibility that M is a proper subspace of ker(f) even when X/M is isomorphic to Y?

Hmm. Let me recall some linear algebra. If f: X → Y is a linear map, then the First Isomorphism Theorem states that X/ker(f) is isomorphic to im(f). Since f is surjective, im(f) = Y. So by the First Isomorphism Theorem, X/ker(f) ≅ Y. 

But here, we&#x27;re given that X/M is isomorphic to Y via the induced map from f, and M is a subspace of ker(f). The problem is asking if M must then be equal to ker(f). 

Let me think. Suppose M is a proper subspace of ker(f). Then the quotient X/M would be a larger space than X/ker(f), right? Because quotienting by a smaller subspace gives a larger quotient space. Wait, no. Wait, actually, if M is contained in ker(f), then the quotient X/M has equivalence classes that are coarser than those in X/ker(f). Wait, maybe not. Let me recall how quotient spaces work.

If you have a subspace N contained in another subspace K of X, then X/K is a quotient of X/N. Specifically, there&#x27;s a natural surjective map from X/N to X/K. So if M is contained in ker(f), then X/M maps onto X/ker(f). But since X/ker(f) is isomorphic to Y, and X/M is also isomorphic to Y, that would require that the surjective map from X/M to X/ker(f) is an isomorphism. But a surjective linear map between vector spaces of the same dimension is an isomorphism. So if X/M and X/ker(f) have the same dimension, then the natural projection from X/M to X/ker(f) is an isomorphism. But when does this happen?

Let&#x27;s put dimensions into this. Suppose X is finite-dimensional for simplicity. Let dim(X) = n, dim(ker(f)) = k, so dim(Y) = n - k by the First Isomorphism Theorem. Now, if M is a subspace of ker(f), then dim(M) = m ≤ k. Then dim(X/M) = n - m. But we are given that X/M is isomorphic to Y, which has dimension n - k. Therefore, n - m = n - k, which implies that m = k. Therefore, dim(M) = dim(ker(f)), and since M is a subspace of ker(f), they must be equal. Therefore, in finite-dimensional cases, M must be equal to ker(f).

But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify finite-dimensionality. Hmm. So does this hold in infinite dimensions as well? Wait, in infinite-dimensional spaces, dimensions are a bit trickier. But maybe we can still argue based on the isomorphism. If there is an isomorphism between X/M and Y induced by f, then the induced map must be both surjective and injective. Let&#x27;s think about the induced map. 

Given f: X → Y is surjective with M ⊂ ker(f), the induced map f&#x27;: X/M → Y is defined by f&#x27;([x]) = f(x). This is well-defined because if [x] = [y], then x - y ∈ M, and since M ⊂ ker(f), f(x - y) = 0, so f(x) = f(y). So f&#x27; is well-defined. 

Now, since f is surjective, f&#x27; is also surjective: for any y ∈ Y, there exists x ∈ X such that f(x) = y, hence f&#x27;([x]) = y. 

If f&#x27; is an isomorphism, then it must also be injective. The kernel of f&#x27; is { [x] | f&#x27;(x) = 0 } = { [x] | f(x) = 0 } = { [x] | x ∈ ker(f) }. But in the quotient X/M, the kernel of f&#x27; would be ker(f)/M. But since f&#x27; is injective, its kernel must be trivial. Therefore, ker(f)/M = {0}, which implies that ker(f) = M. 

Ah, right! Because if the kernel of f&#x27; is trivial, then ker(f)/M must be the zero subspace in X/M, which means that every element of ker(f) is in M. Hence, ker(f) ⊂ M. But we already know M ⊂ ker(f), so equality follows. Therefore, regardless of the dimension, M must equal ker(f). 

So even in infinite dimensions, this argument holds because we&#x27;re using the isomorphism directly. Since the induced map f&#x27; is injective (as an isomorphism), its kernel must be zero, which forces ker(f) = M. 

Therefore, the answer should be that M must equal ker(f). So the statement is true; we can&#x27;t have a proper subspace M of ker(f) such that X/M is isomorphic to Y via the induced map. 

Let me check if there&#x27;s a possible counterexample. Suppose someone says, take X = Y ⊕ ker(f), and then take M to be a subspace of ker(f). Then X/M = Y ⊕ (ker(f)/M). But if we have an isomorphism X/M ≅ Y, then ker(f)/M must be zero, hence ker(f) = M. So in this case, you can&#x27;t have a non-trivial quotient. So even in this case, M must be equal to ker(f). 

Another angle: Let’s think about the natural projection π: X → X/M. The induced map f&#x27;: X/M → Y is an isomorphism. Then f = f&#x27; ◦ π. Since f&#x27; is an isomorphism, it&#x27;s bijective, so the kernel of f is exactly the kernel of π. But the kernel of π is M. Therefore, ker(f) = M. 

Wait, that&#x27;s a succinct way to see it. Since f factors through π via the isomorphism f&#x27;, the kernel of f must equal the kernel of π, which is M. Hence, ker(f) = M. 

Therefore, regardless of how you approach it, the conclusion is that M must equal ker(f). So the answer is that M is equal to ker(f), hence the statement is true.

Given two vector spaces \(X\) and \(Y\) with a surjective linear map \(f: X \rightarrow Y\), and a subspace \(M\) of the kernel of \(f\) such that the quotient space \(X/M\) is isomorphic to \(Y\) under the induced map from \(f\), we need to prove or disprove that \(M\) is equal to the kernel of \(f\).

1. **First Isomorphism Theorem**: By the First Isomorphism Theorem, \(X / \ker(f) \cong Y\) because \(f\) is surjective. This implies \(\dim(X / \ker(f)) = \dim(Y)\).

2. **Induced Map**: The induced map \(f&#x27;: X/M \rightarrow Y\) is well-defined and surjective since \(f\) is surjective. Given \(X/M \cong Y\), \(f&#x27;\) must also be injective.

3. **Kernel of the Induced Map**: The kernel of \(f&#x27;\) consists of equivalence classes \([x]\) such that \(f(x) = 0\). This kernel is \(\ker(f)/M\). Since \(f&#x27;\) is injective, its kernel must be trivial, implying \(\ker(f)/M = \{0\}\).

4. **Equality of Subspaces**: From \(\ker(f)/M = \{0\}\), it follows that every element of \(\ker(f)\) is in \(M\). Since \(M \subset \ker(f)\) by hypothesis, we conclude \(M = \ker(f)\).

Thus, the subspace \(M\) must be equal to the kernel of \(f\).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem here about vector spaces and quotient spaces. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

First, we have two vector spaces, X and Y. There&#x27;s a surjective map f from X to Y. Then there&#x27;s a subspace M of the kernel of f, so M is contained in ker(f). The quotient space X/M is isomorphic to Y under the induced map from f. The question is whether M must actually be equal to the kernel of f. So, do we have M = ker(f), or is there a possibility that M is a proper subspace of ker(f) even when X/M is isomorphic to Y?

Hmm. Let me recall some linear algebra. If f: X → Y is a linear map, then the First Isomorphism Theorem states that X/ker(f) is isomorphic to im(f). Since f is surjective, im(f) = Y. So by the First Isomorphism Theorem, X/ker(f) ≅ Y. 

But here, we&#x27;re given that X/M is isomorphic to Y via the induced map from f, and M is a subspace of ker(f). The problem is asking if M must then be equal to ker(f). 

Let me think. Suppose M is a proper subspace of ker(f). Then the quotient X/M would be a larger space than X/ker(f), right? Because quotienting by a smaller subspace gives a larger quotient space. Wait, no. Wait, actually, if M is contained in ker(f), then the quotient X/M has equivalence classes that are coarser than those in X/ker(f). Wait, maybe not. Let me recall how quotient spaces work.

If you have a subspace N contained in another subspace K of X, then X/K is a quotient of X/N. Specifically, there&#x27;s a natural surjective map from X/N to X/K. So if M is contained in ker(f), then X/M maps onto X/ker(f). But since X/ker(f) is isomorphic to Y, and X/M is also isomorphic to Y, that would require that the surjective map from X/M to X/ker(f) is an isomorphism. But a surjective linear map between vector spaces of the same dimension is an isomorphism. So if X/M and X/ker(f) have the same dimension, then the natural projection from X/M to X/ker(f) is an isomorphism. But when does this happen?

Let&#x27;s put dimensions into this. Suppose X is finite-dimensional for simplicity. Let dim(X) = n, dim(ker(f)) = k, so dim(Y) = n - k by the First Isomorphism Theorem. Now, if M is a subspace of ker(f), then dim(M) = m ≤ k. Then dim(X/M) = n - m. But we are given that X/M is isomorphic to Y, which has dimension n - k. Therefore, n - m = n - k, which implies that m = k. Therefore, dim(M) = dim(ker(f)), and since M is a subspace of ker(f), they must be equal. Therefore, in finite-dimensional cases, M must be equal to ker(f).

But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify finite-dimensionality. Hmm. So does this hold in infinite dimensions as well? Wait, in infinite-dimensional spaces, dimensions are a bit trickier. But maybe we can still argue based on the isomorphism. If there is an isomorphism between X/M and Y induced by f, then the induced map must be both surjective and injective. Let&#x27;s think about the induced map. 

Given f: X → Y is surjective with M ⊂ ker(f), the induced map f&#x27;: X/M → Y is defined by f&#x27;([x]) = f(x). This is well-defined because if [x] = [y], then x - y ∈ M, and since M ⊂ ker(f), f(x - y) = 0, so f(x) = f(y). So f&#x27; is well-defined. 

Now, since f is surjective, f&#x27; is also surjective: for any y ∈ Y, there exists x ∈ X such that f(x) = y, hence f&#x27;([x]) = y. 

If f&#x27; is an isomorphism, then it must also be injective. The kernel of f&#x27; is { [x] | f&#x27;(x) = 0 } = { [x] | f(x) = 0 } = { [x] | x ∈ ker(f) }. But in the quotient X/M, the kernel of f&#x27; would be ker(f)/M. But since f&#x27; is injective, its kernel must be trivial. Therefore, ker(f)/M = {0}, which implies that ker(f) = M. 

Ah, right! Because if the kernel of f&#x27; is trivial, then ker(f)/M must be the zero subspace in X/M, which means that every element of ker(f) is in M. Hence, ker(f) ⊂ M. But we already know M ⊂ ker(f), so equality follows. Therefore, regardless of the dimension, M must equal ker(f). 

So even in infinite dimensions, this argument holds because we&#x27;re using the isomorphism directly. Since the induced map f&#x27; is injective (as an isomorphism), its kernel must be zero, which forces ker(f) = M. 

Therefore, the answer should be that M must equal ker(f). So the statement is true; we can&#x27;t have a proper subspace M of ker(f) such that X/M is isomorphic to Y via the induced map. 

Let me check if there&#x27;s a possible counterexample. Suppose someone says, take X = Y ⊕ ker(f), and then take M to be a subspace of ker(f). Then X/M = Y ⊕ (ker(f)/M). But if we have an isomorphism X/M ≅ Y, then ker(f)/M must be zero, hence ker(f) = M. So in this case, you can&#x27;t have a non-trivial quotient. So even in this case, M must be equal to ker(f). 

Another angle: Let’s think about the natural projection π: X → X/M. The induced map f&#x27;: X/M → Y is an isomorphism. Then f = f&#x27; ◦ π. Since f&#x27; is an isomorphism, it&#x27;s bijective, so the kernel of f is exactly the kernel of π. But the kernel of π is M. Therefore, ker(f) = M.

Given two vector spaces \(X\) and \(Y\) with a surjective linear map \(f: X \rightarrow Y\), and a subspace \(M\) of the kernel of \(f\) such that the quotient space \(X/M\) is isomorphic to \(Y\) under the induced map from \(f\), we need to prove or disprove that \(M\) is equal to the kernel of \(f\).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem here about vector spaces and quotient spaces. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

First, we have two vector spaces, X and Y. There&#x27;s a surjective map f from X to Y. Then there&#x27;s a subspace M of the kernel of f, so M is contained in ker(f). The quotient space X/M is isomorphic to Y under the induced map from f. The question is whether M must actually be equal to the kernel of f. So, do we have M = ker(f), or is there a possibility that M is a proper subspace of ker(f) even when X/M is isomorphic to Y?

Hmm. Let me recall some linear algebra. If f: X → Y is a linear map, then the First Isomorphism Theorem states that X/ker(f) is isomorphic to im(f). Since f is surjective, im(f) = Y. So by the First Isomorphism Theorem, X/ker(f) ≅ Y. 

But here, we&#x27;re given that X/M is isomorphic to Y via the induced map from f, and M is a subspace of ker(f). The problem is asking if M must then be equal to ker(f). 

Let me think. Suppose M is a proper subspace of ker(f). Then the quotient X/M would be a larger space than X/ker(f), right? Because quotienting by a smaller subspace gives a larger quotient space. Wait, no. Wait, actually, if M is contained in ker(f), then the quotient X/M has equivalence classes that are coarser than those in X/ker(f). Wait, maybe not. Let me recall how quotient spaces work.

If you have a subspace N contained in another subspace K of X, then X/K is a quotient of X/N. Specifically, there&#x27;s a natural surjective map from X/N to X/K. So if M is contained in ker(f), then X/M maps onto X/ker(f). But since X/ker(f) is isomorphic to Y, and X/M is also isomorphic to Y, that would require that the surjective map from X/M to X/ker(f) is an isomorphism. But a surjective linear map between vector spaces of the same dimension is an isomorphism. So if X/M and X/ker(f) have the same dimension, then the natural projection from X/M to X/ker(f) is an isomorphism. But when does this happen?

Let&#x27;s put dimensions into this. Suppose X is finite-dimensional for simplicity. Let dim(X) = n, dim(ker(f)) = k, so dim(Y) = n - k by the First Isomorphism Theorem. Now, if M is a subspace of ker(f), then dim(M) = m ≤ k. Then dim(X/M) = n - m. But we are given that X/M is isomorphic to Y, which has dimension n - k. Therefore, n - m = n - k, which implies that m = k. Therefore, dim(M) = dim(ker(f)), and since M is a subspace of ker(f), they must be equal. Therefore, in finite-dimensional cases, M must be equal to ker(f).

But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify finite-dimensionality. Hmm. So does this hold in infinite dimensions as well? Wait, in infinite-dimensional spaces, dimensions are a bit trickier. But maybe we can still argue based on the isomorphism. If there is an isomorphism between X/M and Y induced by f, then the induced map must be both surjective and injective. Let&#x27;s think about the induced map. 

Given f: X → Y is surjective with M ⊂ ker(f), the induced map f&#x27;: X/M → Y is defined by f&#x27;([x]) = f(x). This is well-defined because if [x] = [y], then x - y ∈ M, and since M ⊂ ker(f), f(x - y) = 0, so f(x) = f(y). So f&#x27; is well-defined. 

Now, since f is surjective, f&#x27; is also surjective: for any y ∈ Y, there exists x ∈ X such that f(x) = y, hence f&#x27;([x]) = y. 

If f&#x27; is an isomorphism, then it must also be injective. The kernel of f&#x27; is { [x] | f&#x27;(x) = 0 } = { [x] | f(x) = 0 } = { [x] | x ∈ ker(f) }. But in the quotient X/M, the kernel of f&#x27; would be ker(f)/M. But since f&#x27; is injective, its kernel must be trivial. Therefore, ker(f)/M = {0}, which implies that ker(f) = M. 

Ah, right! Because if the kernel of f&#x27; is trivial, then ker(f)/M must be the zero subspace in X/M, which means that every element of ker(f) is in M. Hence, ker(f) ⊂ M. But we already know M ⊂ ker(f), so equality follows. Therefore, regardless of the dimension, M must equal ker(f). 

So even in infinite dimensions, this argument holds because we&#x27;re using the isomorphism directly. Since the induced map f&#x27; is injective (as an isomorphism), its kernel must be zero, which forces ker(f) = M. 

Therefore, the answer should be that M must equal ker(f). So the statement is true; we can&#x27;t have a proper subspace M of ker(f) such that X/M is isomorphic to Y via the induced map. 

Let me check if there&#x27;s a possible counterexample. Suppose someone says, take X = Y ⊕ ker(f), and then take M to be a subspace of ker(f). Then X/M = Y ⊕ (ker(f)/M). But if we have an isomorphism X/M ≅ Y, then ker(f)/M must be zero, hence ker(f) = M. So in this case, you can&#x27;t have a non-trivial quotient. So even in this case, M must be equal to ker(f). 

Another angle: Let’s think about the natural projection π: X → X/M. The induced map f&#x27;: X/M → Y is an isomorphism. Then f = f&#x27; ◦ π. Since f&#x27; is an isomorphism, it&#x27;s bijective, so the kernel of f is exactly the kernel of π. But the kernel of π is M. Therefore, ker(f) = M. 

Wait, that&#x27;s a succinct way to see it. Since f factors through π via the isomorphism f&#x27;, the kernel of f must equal the kernel of π, which is M. Hence, ker(f) = M. 

Therefore, regardless of how you approach it, the conclusion is that M must equal ker(f). So the answer is that M is equal to ker(f), hence the statement is true.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{M = \ker f}

Given two vector spaces \(X\) and \(Y\) with a surjective linear map \(f: X \rightarrow Y\), and a subspace \(M\) of the kernel of \(f\) such that the quotient space \(X/M\) is isomorphic to \(Y\) under the induced map from \(f\), we need to prove or disprove that \(M\) is equal to the kernel of \(f\).

1. **First Isomorphism Theorem**: By the First Isomorphism Theorem, \(X / \ker(f) \cong Y\) because \(f\) is surjective. This implies \(\dim(X / \ker(f)) = \dim(Y)\).

2. **Induced Map**: The induced map \(f&#x27;: X/M \rightarrow Y\) is well-defined and surjective since \(f\) is surjective. Given \(X/M \cong Y\), \(f&#x27;\) must also be injective.

3. **Kernel of the Induced Map**: The kernel of \(f&#x27;\) consists of equivalence classes \([x]\) such that \(f(x) = 0\). This kernel is \(\ker(f)/M\). Since \(f&#x27;\) is injective, its kernel must be trivial, implying \(\ker(f)/M = \{0\}\).

4. **Equality of Subspaces**: From \(\ker(f)/M = \{0\}\), it follows that every element of \(\ker(f)\) is in \(M\). Since \(M \subset \ker(f)\) by hypothesis, we conclude \(M = \ker(f)\).

Thus, the subspace \(M\) must be equal to the kernel of \(f\).

Wait, no. Wait, actually, if M is contained in ker(f), then the quotient X/M has equivalence classes that are coarser than those in X/ker(f). Wait, maybe not. Let me recall how quotient spaces work.

If you have a subspace N contained in another subspace K of X, then X/K is a quotient of X/N. Specifically, there&#x27;s a natural surjective map from X/N to X/K. So if M is contained in ker(f), then X/M maps onto X/ker(f). But since X/ker(f) is isomorphic to Y, and X/M is also isomorphic to Y, that would require that the surjective map from X/M to X/ker(f) is an isomorphism. But a surjective linear map between vector spaces of the same dimension is an isomorphism. So if X/M and X/ker(f) have the same dimension, then the natural projection from X/M to X/ker(f) is an isomorphism. But when does this happen?

Let&#x27;s put dimensions into this. Suppose X is finite-dimensional for simplicity. Let dim(X) = n, dim(ker(f)) = k, so dim(Y) = n - k by the First Isomorphism Theorem. Now, if M is a subspace of ker(f), then dim(M) = m ≤ k. Then dim(X/M) = n - m. But we are given that X/M is isomorphic to Y, which has dimension n - k. Therefore, n - m = n - k, which implies that m = k. Therefore, dim(M) = dim(ker(f)), and since M is a subspace of ker(f), they must be equal. Therefore, in finite-dimensional cases, M must be equal to ker(f).

But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify finite-dimensionality. Hmm. So does this hold in infinite dimensions as well? Wait, in infinite-dimensional spaces, dimensions are a bit trickier. But maybe we can still argue based on the isomorphism. If there is an isomorphism between X/M and Y induced by f, then the induced map must be both surjective and injective. Let&#x27;s think about the induced map. 

Given f: X → Y is surjective with M ⊂ ker(f), the induced map f&#x27;: X/M → Y is defined by f&#x27;([x]) = f(x). This is well-defined because if [x] = [y], then x - y ∈ M, and since M ⊂ ker(f), f(x - y) = 0, so f(x) = f(y). So f&#x27; is well-defined. 

Now, since f is surjective, f&#x27; is also surjective: for any y ∈ Y, there exists x ∈ X such that f(x) = y, hence f&#x27;([x]) = y. 

If f&#x27; is an isomorphism, then it must also be injective. The kernel of f&#x27; is { [x] | f&#x27;(x) = 0 } = { [x] | f(x) = 0 } = { [x] | x ∈ ker(f) }. But in the quotient X/M, the kernel of f&#x27; would be ker(f)/M. But since f&#x27; is injective, its kernel must be trivial. Therefore, ker(f)/M = {0}, which implies that ker(f) = M. 

Ah, right! Because if the kernel of f&#x27; is trivial, then ker(f)/M must be the zero subspace in X/M, which means that every element of ker(f) is in M. Hence, ker(f) ⊂ M. But we already know M ⊂ ker(f), so equality follows. Therefore, regardless of the dimension, M must equal ker(f). 

So even in infinite dimensions, this argument holds because we&#x27;re using the isomorphism directly. Since the induced map f&#x27; is injective (as an isomorphism), its kernel must be zero, which forces ker(f) = M. 

Therefore, the answer should be that M must equal ker(f). So the statement is true; we can&#x27;t have a proper subspace M of ker(f) such that X/M is isomorphic to Y via the induced map. 

Let me check if there&#x27;s a possible counterexample. Suppose someone says, take X = Y ⊕ ker(f), and then take M to be a subspace of ker(f). Then X/M = Y ⊕ (ker(f)/M). But if we have an isomorphism X/M ≅ Y, then ker(f)/M must be zero, hence ker(f) = M. So in this case, you can&#x27;t have a non-trivial quotient. So even in this case, M must be equal to ker(f). 

Another angle: Let’s think about the natural projection π: X → X/M. The induced map f&#x27;: X/M → Y is an isomorphism. Then f = f&#x27; ◦ π. Since f&#x27; is an isomorphism, it&#x27;s bijective, so the kernel of f is exactly the kernel of π. But the kernel of π is M. Therefore, ker(f) = M. 

Wait, that&#x27;s a succinct way to see it. Since f factors through π via the isomorphism f&#x27;, the kernel of f must equal the kernel of π, which is M. Hence, ker(f) = M. 

Therefore, regardless of how you approach it, the conclusion is that M must equal ker(f). So the answer is that M is equal to ker(f), hence the statement is true.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{M = \ker f}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given two vector spaces \(X\) and \(Y\) with a surjective linear map \(f: X \rightarrow Y\), and a subspace \(M\) of the kernel of \(f\) such that the quotient space \(X/M\) is isomorphic to \(Y\) under the induced map from \(f\), we need to prove or disprove that \(M\) is equal to the kernel of \(f\).

1. **First Isomorphism Theorem**: By the First Isomorphism Theorem, \(X / \ker(f) \cong Y\) because \(f\) is surjective. This implies \(\dim(X / \ker(f)) = \dim(Y)\).

2. **Induced Map**: The induced map \(f&#x27;: X/M \rightarrow Y\) is well-defined and surjective since \(f\) is surjective. Given \(X/M \cong Y\), \(f&#x27;\) must also be injective.

3. **Kernel of the Induced Map**: The kernel of \(f&#x27;\) consists of equivalence classes \([x]\) such that \(f(x) = 0\). This kernel is \(\ker(f)/M\). Since \(f&#x27;\) is injective, its kernel must be trivial, implying \(\ker(f)/M = \{0\}\).

4. **Equality of Subspaces**: From \(\ker(f)/M = \{0\}\), it follows that every element of \(\ker(f)\) is in \(M\). Since \(M \subset \ker(f)\) by hypothesis, we conclude \(M = \ker(f)\).

Thus, the subspace \(M\) must be equal to the kernel of \(f\).

\boxed{M = \ker f}
