Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to convert this triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to either cylindrical or spherical coordinates. The integral is given as:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

First, I should probably understand the region of integration and see which coordinate system—cylindrical or spherical—would make things simpler. Let me start by analyzing the limits of integration.

Looking at the outermost integral, x goes from 0 to 1. Then, for each x, y goes from 0 to x. So in the xy-plane, this is a triangular region where y ranges from 0 to x, and x itself goes up to 1. Then, for each (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). That upper limit for z is interesting—it&#x27;s the equation of a cone, right? Because in Cartesian coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is a cone opening upwards with its vertex at the origin. So the region of integration is bounded below by the xy-plane (z=0) and above by this cone.

So, visualizing this, we have a region that&#x27;s a portion of a cone. Now, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} divided by (x^2 + y^2 + z^2). Let&#x27;s note that x^2 + y^2 is r^2 in cylindrical coordinates, and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is r^2 in spherical coordinates (but r in spherical is different from cylindrical). Hmm, so maybe spherical coordinates could help here because the denominator is the square of the distance from the origin, i.e., the radius in spherical coordinates.

But wait, the numerator is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} which is r^3 in cylindrical coordinates. The denominator is (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) which is r^2 in spherical coordinates (if we use r for spherical as the radial distance). So maybe converting to spherical coordinates would make the integrand simplify nicely. Let me check.

Alternatively, cylindrical coordinates might also work. Let&#x27;s consider both options.

First, let&#x27;s recall the conversions:

Cylindrical coordinates:
x = r cosθ
y = r sinθ
z = z
Jacobian determinant is r.

Spherical coordinates:
x = ρ sinφ cosθ
y = ρ sinφ sinθ
z = ρ cosφ
Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ.

Given the integrand involves both (x^2 + y^2) and (x^2 + y^2 + z^2), perhaps spherical coordinates would be better, since in spherical coordinates, x^2 + y^2 = ρ^2 sin^2φ and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = ρ^2. So substituting these into the integrand:

Numerator: (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} = (ρ^2 sin^2φ)^{3/2} = ρ^3 sin^3φ

Denominator: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = ρ^2

So the integrand becomes ρ^3 sin^3φ / ρ^2 = ρ sin^3φ

Then, the integrand simplifies to ρ sin^3φ. The Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ, so the entire integral in spherical coordinates would be:

∫∫∫ (ρ sin^3φ) * ρ^2 sinφ dρ dφ dθ = ∫∫∫ ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, that seems manageable. But let&#x27;s check the limits of integration in spherical coordinates.

Original limits:

x from 0 to 1

y from 0 to x

z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

First, in spherical coordinates, the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) becomes ρ cosφ = sqrt(ρ^2 sin^2φ) = ρ sinφ. So:

ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ =&gt; cosφ = sinφ =&gt; tanφ = 1 =&gt; φ = π/4

So the upper limit for z is the cone φ = π/4. The lower limit for z is 0, which corresponds to φ = π/2 (the xy-plane), but wait, no. Wait, z goes from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). When z=0, that&#x27;s the xy-plane (φ=π/2). The upper limit is the cone φ=π/4. So in spherical coordinates, φ would go from π/4 to π/2. Wait, let me check:

In spherical coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is equivalent to ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ, so φ = π/4 as above. So for each (x, y), z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) up to the cone at φ=π/4. But actually, in spherical coordinates, varying z with fixed x and y corresponds to moving along a line of constant θ and φ? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. For a given (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). So in spherical terms, for a given radius in the xy-plane (r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)), z goes from 0 up to r. So in spherical coordinates, that would translate to ρ cosφ = z, and z goes up to r = ρ sinφ. So ρ cosφ &lt;= ρ sinφ =&gt; tanφ &gt;= 1 =&gt; φ &gt;= π/4, but since z is going from 0 to r, that would mean φ is between π/4 (when z=r) and π/2 (when z=0). Wait, but ρ is a variable here. Maybe I need to parametrize this.

Alternatively, maybe cylindrical coordinates would be better here. Let me try cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, z = z. The Jacobian is r.

The limits:

Original x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, so in cylindrical coordinates, θ goes from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, which is the line y=x in the first quadrant, so θ from 0 to π/4. Then r would go from 0 to something? Wait, x goes from 0 to 1, and y from 0 to x. Let me visualize this in the xy-plane. When x is from 0 to 1, and for each x, y is from 0 to x. So this is a triangular region in the xy-plane bounded by x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, which is the same as θ from 0 to π/4 and r from 0 to secθ, because x = r cosθ, so r = x / cosθ. When x=1, r = 1 / cosθ. So in cylindrical coordinates, the r limits would be from 0 to 1 / cosθ, but θ from 0 to π/4. Wait, let me verify:

If we fix θ, then in the original limits, y goes from 0 to x. In cylindrical coordinates, y = r sinθ and x = r cosθ. So y &lt;= x implies r sinθ &lt;= r cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4. That&#x27;s correct. So θ ranges from 0 to π/4. Then, for each θ, x goes from 0 to 1. Since x = r cosθ, then r cosθ goes from 0 to 1. So r goes from 0 to 1 / cosθ. Therefore, in cylindrical coordinates, the limits would be θ from 0 to π/4, r from 0 to 1 / cosθ, and z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = r.

So the z limits in cylindrical coordinates are from 0 to r. Then, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} / (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = (r^2)^{3/2} / (r^2 + z^2) = r^3 / (r^2 + z^2). Then, the integral becomes:

∫ (θ=0 to π/4) ∫ (r=0 to 1/cosθ) ∫ (z=0 to r) [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r dz dr dθ

Wait, the Jacobian is r, so the integrand becomes [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r = r^4 / (r^2 + z^2). So the integral in cylindrical coordinates is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

Hmm, is this easier than the original Cartesian integral? The original integral had a complicated integrand, but maybe in cylindrical coordinates, integrating with respect to z first might be manageable.

Alternatively, in spherical coordinates, let&#x27;s see. The integrand becomes ρ sin^3φ, and the Jacobian is ρ^2 sinφ, so overall ρ^3 sin^4φ. The limits in spherical coordinates would require figuring out ρ, φ, θ.

First, θ is from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, similar to cylindrical coordinates.

φ is from π/4 to π/2 because z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) to the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) (φ=π/4).

ρ is a bit trickier. For each direction (θ, φ), ρ starts at 0 and goes out to the maximum value within the region. But the original x goes up to 1. Let&#x27;s see. In spherical coordinates, x = ρ sinφ cosθ. The original x goes from 0 to 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;= 1. Therefore, ρ &lt;= 1 / (sinφ cosθ). But this seems complicated. However, the original limits also have y &lt;= x, which in spherical coordinates is ρ sinφ sinθ &lt;= ρ sinφ cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4, as before. So θ is from 0 to π/4. The upper limit for x is 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;=1. So ρ &lt;= 1/(sinφ cosθ). So in spherical coordinates, the integral would be:

∫_{θ=0}^{π/4} ∫_{φ=π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{ρ=0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ \, dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, integrating ρ^3 is straightforward, but the upper limit for ρ is 1/(sinφ cosθ), which when integrated would lead to terms with 1/(sinφ cosθ)^4, which might complicate things. Then integrating over φ and θ could be messy. So maybe spherical coordinates aren&#x27;t the best here.

Alternatively, in cylindrical coordinates, after integrating z first, maybe it&#x27;s manageable.

So let&#x27;s stick with cylindrical coordinates for now. Let me write out the integral again:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

So first, integrate with respect to z:

Let’s compute the inner integral ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz

Since r is treated as a constant with respect to z, this becomes r^4 ∫_{0}^{r} 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz

The integral of 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz is (1/r) arctan(z/r) ) + C

So evaluating from 0 to r:

(1/r) [ arctan(r/r) - arctan(0/r) ] = (1/r)[ arctan(1) - arctan(0) ] = (1/r)(π/4 - 0) = π/(4r)

Therefore, the inner integral becomes r^4 * π/(4r) = (π/4) r^3

So now, the integral reduces to:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} (π/4) r^3 dr dθ

= (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr ] dθ

Compute the integral over r:

∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr = [ (1/4) r^4 ] from 0 to 1/cosθ = (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So now:

I = (π/4) * (1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} (1/cosθ)^4 dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Hmm, integrating sec^4θ. The integral of sec^4θ dθ is a standard integral. Recall that ∫ sec^nθ dθ can be done using reduction formulas or using substitution. Let me recall:

∫ sec^4θ dθ = ∫ sec^2θ * sec^2θ dθ. Let’s use the identity sec^2θ = 1 + tan^2θ.

So:

= ∫ (1 + tan^2θ) sec^2θ dθ

Let u = tanθ, then du = sec^2θ dθ. Then the integral becomes:

∫ (1 + u^2) du = u + (1/3)u^3 + C = tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ + C

Therefore, the integral of sec^4θ dθ from 0 to π/4 is:

[ tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ ] from 0 to π/4

At π/4: tan(π/4) = 1, so 1 + (1/3)(1)^3 = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3

At 0: tan(0) = 0, so 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, the integral is 4/3 - 0 = 4/3

Therefore, I = (π/16) * (4/3) = π/12

So the final result is π/12.

Wait, let me verify once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make any mistakes.

Starting from the original integral:

Converted to cylindrical coordinates, ended up with:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz dr dθ

Integrated over z first:

Integral over z gives (π/4) r^3

Then integrated over r:

(1/4) r^4 evaluated from 0 to 1/cosθ gives (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So I becomes (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ = (π/16)*(4/3) = π/12

That seems correct. Let me check if converting to spherical coordinates would have been easier. Let me try that approach as a sanity check.

In spherical coordinates, the integral is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

First, integrate over ρ:

∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 dρ = [ (1/4) ρ^4 ] from 0 to 1/(sinφ cosθ) = (1/4)(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4

So the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} (1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 sin^4φ dφ dθ

Simplify the integrand:

(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 * sin^4φ = (1/sin^4φ cos^4θ) * sin^4φ = 1/(cos^4θ) * 1

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ ] / cos^4θ dθ

But wait, integrating over φ from π/4 to π/2:

∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ = π/2 - π/4 = π/4

Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

(1/4) * (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} 1/cos^4θ dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Which is exactly the same as in cylindrical coordinates! So indeed, the spherical coordinate approach also leads to the same integral, which evaluates to π/12. Therefore, both coordinate systems lead to the same result, but cylindrical coordinates perhaps made it a bit more straightforward because the limits for z were simpler.

So in conclusion, the integral simplifies to π/12 when converted to cylindrical coordinates (or spherical, but cylindrical was perhaps easier here). Therefore, the answer is π/12.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To convert the given triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical coordinates, we start by analyzing the region of integration and the integrand. The integral is:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

The region of integration is bounded by the cone \( z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the xy-plane. In cylindrical coordinates, this region is described by \( 0 \leq r \leq \frac{1}{\cos\theta} \), \( 0 \leq z \leq r \), and \( 0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{4} \).

The integrand in cylindrical coordinates becomes:
\[
\frac{(r^2)^{3/2}}{r^2 + z^2} = \frac{r^3}{r^2 + z^2}
\]

Including the Jacobian determinant \( r \), the integral transforms to:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( z \):
\[
\int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz = r^4 \left[ \frac{1}{r} \arctan\left(\frac{z}{r}\right) \right]_{0}^{r} = r^4 \left( \frac{\pi}{4r} \right) = \frac{\pi}{4} r^3
\]

Next, integrate with respect to \( r \):
\[
\int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \frac{\pi}{4} r^3 \, dr = \frac{\pi}{4} \left[ \frac{r^4}{4} \right]_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} = \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta
\]

Finally, integrate with respect to \( \theta \):
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{16} \int_{0}^{\pi/4} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta
\]

Using the substitution \( u = \tan\theta \), the integral of \( \sec^4\theta \) is evaluated as:
\[
\int \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \tan\theta + \frac{1}{3} \tan^3\theta \Big|_{0}^{\pi/4} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Thus, the integral simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\pi}{16} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{\pi}{12}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}

Denominator: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = ρ^2

So the integrand becomes ρ^3 sin^3φ / ρ^2 = ρ sin^3φ

Then, the integrand simplifies to ρ sin^3φ. The Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ, so the entire integral in spherical coordinates would be:

∫∫∫ (ρ sin^3φ) * ρ^2 sinφ dρ dφ dθ = ∫∫∫ ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, that seems manageable. But let&#x27;s check the limits of integration in spherical coordinates.

Original limits:

x from 0 to 1

y from 0 to x

z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

First, in spherical coordinates, the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) becomes ρ cosφ = sqrt(ρ^2 sin^2φ) = ρ sinφ. So:

ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ =&gt; cosφ = sinφ =&gt; tanφ = 1 =&gt; φ = π/4

So the upper limit for z is the cone φ = π/4. The lower limit for z is 0, which corresponds to φ = π/2 (the xy-plane), but wait, no. Wait, z goes from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). When z=0, that&#x27;s the xy-plane (φ=π/2). The upper limit is the cone φ=π/4. So in spherical coordinates, φ would go from π/4 to π/2. Wait, let me check:

In spherical coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is equivalent to ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ, so φ = π/4 as above. So for each (x, y), z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) up to the cone at φ=π/4. But actually, in spherical coordinates, varying z with fixed x and y corresponds to moving along a line of constant θ and φ? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. For a given (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). So in spherical terms, for a given radius in the xy-plane (r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)), z goes from 0 up to r. So in spherical coordinates, that would translate to ρ cosφ = z, and z goes up to r = ρ sinφ. So ρ cosφ &lt;= ρ sinφ =&gt; tanφ &gt;= 1 =&gt; φ &gt;= π/4, but since z is going from 0 to r, that would mean φ is between π/4 (when z=r) and π/2 (when z=0). Wait, but ρ is a variable here. Maybe I need to parametrize this.

Alternatively, maybe cylindrical coordinates would be better here. Let me try cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, z = z. The Jacobian is r.

The limits:

Original x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, so in cylindrical coordinates, θ goes from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, which is the line y=x in the first quadrant, so θ from 0 to π/4. Then r would go from 0 to something? Wait, x goes from 0 to 1, and y from 0 to x. Let me visualize this in the xy-plane. When x is from 0 to 1, and for each x, y is from 0 to x. So this is a triangular region in the xy-plane bounded by x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, which is the same as θ from 0 to π/4 and r from 0 to secθ, because x = r cosθ, so r = x / cosθ. When x=1, r = 1 / cosθ. So in cylindrical coordinates, the r limits would be from 0 to 1 / cosθ, but θ from 0 to π/4. Wait, let me verify:

If we fix θ, then in the original limits, y goes from 0 to x. In cylindrical coordinates, y = r sinθ and x = r cosθ. So y &lt;= x implies r sinθ &lt;= r cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4. That&#x27;s correct. So θ ranges from 0 to π/4. Then, for each θ, x goes from 0 to 1. Since x = r cosθ, then r cosθ goes from 0 to 1. So r goes from 0 to 1 / cosθ. Therefore, in cylindrical coordinates, the limits would be θ from 0 to π/4, r from 0 to 1 / cosθ, and z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = r.

So the z limits in cylindrical coordinates are from 0 to r. Then, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} / (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = (r^2)^{3/2} / (r^2 + z^2) = r^3 / (r^2 + z^2). Then, the integral becomes:

∫ (θ=0 to π/4) ∫ (r=0 to 1/cosθ) ∫ (z=0 to r) [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r dz dr dθ

Wait, the Jacobian is r, so the integrand becomes [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r = r^4 / (r^2 + z^2). So the integral in cylindrical coordinates is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

Hmm, is this easier than the original Cartesian integral? The original integral had a complicated integrand, but maybe in cylindrical coordinates, integrating with respect to z first might be manageable.

Alternatively, in spherical coordinates, let&#x27;s see. The integrand becomes ρ sin^3φ, and the Jacobian is ρ^2 sinφ, so overall ρ^3 sin^4φ. The limits in spherical coordinates would require figuring out ρ, φ, θ.

First, θ is from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, similar to cylindrical coordinates.

φ is from π/4 to π/2 because z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) to the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) (φ=π/4).

ρ is a bit trickier. For each direction (θ, φ), ρ starts at 0 and goes out to the maximum value within the region. But the original x goes up to 1. Let&#x27;s see. In spherical coordinates, x = ρ sinφ cosθ. The original x goes from 0 to 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;= 1. Therefore, ρ &lt;= 1 / (sinφ cosθ). But this seems complicated. However, the original limits also have y &lt;= x, which in spherical coordinates is ρ sinφ sinθ &lt;= ρ sinφ cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4, as before. So θ is from 0 to π/4. The upper limit for x is 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;=1. So ρ &lt;= 1/(sinφ cosθ). So in spherical coordinates, the integral would be:

∫_{θ=0}^{π/4} ∫_{φ=π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{ρ=0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ \, dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, integrating ρ^3 is straightforward, but the upper limit for ρ is 1/(sinφ cosθ), which when integrated would lead to terms with 1/(sinφ cosθ)^4, which might complicate things. Then integrating over φ and θ could be messy. So maybe spherical coordinates aren&#x27;t the best here.

Alternatively, in cylindrical coordinates, after integrating z first, maybe it&#x27;s manageable.

So let&#x27;s stick with cylindrical coordinates for now. Let me write out the integral again:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

So first, integrate with respect to z:

Let’s compute the inner integral ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz

Since r is treated as a constant with respect to z, this becomes r^4 ∫_{0}^{r} 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz

The integral of 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz is (1/r) arctan(z/r) ) + C

So evaluating from 0 to r:

(1/r) [ arctan(r/r) - arctan(0/r) ] = (1/r)[ arctan(1) - arctan(0) ] = (1/r)(π/4 - 0) = π/(4r)

Therefore, the inner integral becomes r^4 * π/(4r) = (π/4) r^3

So now, the integral reduces to:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} (π/4) r^3 dr dθ

= (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr ] dθ

Compute the integral over r:

∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr = [ (1/4) r^4 ] from 0 to 1/cosθ = (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So now:

I = (π/4) * (1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} (1/cosθ)^4 dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Hmm, integrating sec^4θ. The integral of sec^4θ dθ is a standard integral. Recall that ∫ sec^nθ dθ can be done using reduction formulas or using substitution. Let me recall:

∫ sec^4θ dθ = ∫ sec^2θ * sec^2θ dθ. Let’s use the identity sec^2θ = 1 + tan^2θ.

So:

= ∫ (1 + tan^2θ) sec^2θ dθ

Let u = tanθ, then du = sec^2θ dθ. Then the integral becomes:

∫ (1 + u^2) du = u + (1/3)u^3 + C = tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ + C

Therefore, the integral of sec^4θ dθ from 0 to π/4 is:

[ tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ ] from 0 to π/4

At π/4: tan(π/4) = 1, so 1 + (1/3)(1)^3 = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3

At 0: tan(0) = 0, so 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, the integral is 4/3 - 0 = 4/3

Therefore, I = (π/16) * (4/3) = π/12

So the final result is π/12.

Wait, let me verify once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make any mistakes.

Starting from the original integral:

Converted to cylindrical coordinates, ended up with:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz dr dθ

Integrated over z first:

Integral over z gives (π/4) r^3

Then integrated over r:

(1/4) r^4 evaluated from 0 to 1/cosθ gives (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So I becomes (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ = (π/16)*(4/3) = π/12

That seems correct. Let me check if converting to spherical coordinates would have been easier. Let me try that approach as a sanity check.

In spherical coordinates, the integral is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

First, integrate over ρ:

∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 dρ = [ (1/4) ρ^4 ] from 0 to 1/(sinφ cosθ) = (1/4)(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4

So the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} (1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 sin^4φ dφ dθ

Simplify the integrand:

(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 * sin^4φ = (1/sin^4φ cos^4θ) * sin^4φ = 1/(cos^4θ) * 1

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ ] / cos^4θ dθ

But wait, integrating over φ from π/4 to π/2:

∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ = π/2 - π/4 = π/4

Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

(1/4) * (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} 1/cos^4θ dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Which is exactly the same as in cylindrical coordinates! So indeed, the spherical coordinate approach also leads to the same integral, which evaluates to π/12. Therefore, both coordinate systems lead to the same result, but cylindrical coordinates perhaps made it a bit more straightforward because the limits for z were simpler.

So in conclusion, the integral simplifies to π/12 when converted to cylindrical coordinates (or spherical, but cylindrical was perhaps easier here). Therefore, the answer is π/12.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To convert the given triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical coordinates, we start by analyzing the region of integration and the integrand. The integral is:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

The region of integration is bounded by the cone \( z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the xy-plane. In cylindrical coordinates, this region is described by \( 0 \leq r \leq \frac{1}{\cos\theta} \), \( 0 \leq z \leq r \), and \( 0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{4} \).

The integrand in cylindrical coordinates becomes:
\[
\frac{(r^2)^{3/2}}{r^2 + z^2} = \frac{r^3}{r^2 + z^2}
\]

Including the Jacobian determinant \( r \), the integral transforms to:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( z \):
\[
\int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz = r^4 \left[ \frac{1}{r} \arctan\left(\frac{z}{r}\right) \right]_{0}^{r} = r^4 \left( \frac{\pi}{4r} \right) = \frac{\pi}{4} r^3
\]

Next, integrate with respect to \( r \):
\[
\int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \frac{\pi}{4} r^3 \, dr = \frac{\pi}{4} \left[ \frac{r^4}{4} \right]_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} = \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta
\]

Finally, integrate with respect to \( \theta \):
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{16} \int_{0}^{\pi/4} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta
\]

Using the substitution \( u = \tan\theta \), the integral of \( \sec^4\theta \) is evaluated as:
\[
\int \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \tan\theta + \frac{1}{3} \tan^3\theta \Big|_{0}^{\pi/4} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Thus, the integral simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\pi}{16} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{\pi}{12}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to convert this triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to either cylindrical or spherical coordinates. The integral is given as:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

First, I should probably understand the region of integration and see which coordinate system—cylindrical or spherical—would make things simpler. Let me start by analyzing the limits of integration.

Looking at the outermost integral, x goes from 0 to 1. Then, for each x, y goes from 0 to x. So in the xy-plane, this is a triangular region where y ranges from 0 to x, and x itself goes up to 1. Then, for each (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). That upper limit for z is interesting—it&#x27;s the equation of a cone, right? Because in Cartesian coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is a cone opening upwards with its vertex at the origin. So the region of integration is bounded below by the xy-plane (z=0) and above by this cone.

So, visualizing this, we have a region that&#x27;s a portion of a cone. Now, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} divided by (x^2 + y^2 + z^2). Let&#x27;s note that x^2 + y^2 is r^2 in cylindrical coordinates, and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is r^2 in spherical coordinates (but r in spherical is different from cylindrical). Hmm, so maybe spherical coordinates could help here because the denominator is the square of the distance from the origin, i.e., the radius in spherical coordinates.

But wait, the numerator is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} which is r^3 in cylindrical coordinates. The denominator is (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) which is r^2 in spherical coordinates (if we use r for spherical as the radial distance). So maybe converting to spherical coordinates would make the integrand simplify nicely. Let me check.

Alternatively, cylindrical coordinates might also work. Let&#x27;s consider both options.

First, let&#x27;s recall the conversions:

Cylindrical coordinates:
x = r cosθ
y = r sinθ
z = z
Jacobian determinant is r.

Spherical coordinates:
x = ρ sinφ cosθ
y = ρ sinφ sinθ
z = ρ cosφ
Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ.

Given the integrand involves both (x^2 + y^2) and (x^2 + y^2 + z^2), perhaps spherical coordinates would be better, since in spherical coordinates, x^2 + y^2 = ρ^2 sin^2φ and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = ρ^2. So substituting these into the integrand:

Numerator: (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} = (ρ^2 sin^2φ)^{3/2} = ρ^3 sin^3φ

Denominator: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = ρ^2

So the integrand becomes ρ^3 sin^3φ / ρ^2 = ρ sin^3φ

Then, the integrand simplifies to ρ sin^3φ. The Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ, so the entire integral in spherical coordinates would be:

∫∫∫ (ρ sin^3φ) * ρ^2 sinφ dρ dφ dθ = ∫∫∫ ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, that seems manageable. But let&#x27;s check the limits of integration in spherical coordinates.

Original limits:

x from 0 to 1

y from 0 to x

z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

First, in spherical coordinates, the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) becomes ρ cosφ = sqrt(ρ^2 sin^2φ) = ρ sinφ. So:

ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ =&gt; cosφ = sinφ =&gt; tanφ = 1 =&gt; φ = π/4

So the upper limit for z is the cone φ = π/4. The lower limit for z is 0, which corresponds to φ = π/2 (the xy-plane), but wait, no. Wait, z goes from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). When z=0, that&#x27;s the xy-plane (φ=π/2). The upper limit is the cone φ=π/4. So in spherical coordinates, φ would go from π/4 to π/2. Wait, let me check:

In spherical coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is equivalent to ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ, so φ = π/4 as above. So for each (x, y), z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) up to the cone at φ=π/4. But actually, in spherical coordinates, varying z with fixed x and y corresponds to moving along a line of constant θ and φ? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. For a given (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). So in spherical terms, for a given radius in the xy-plane (r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)), z goes from 0 up to r. So in spherical coordinates, that would translate to ρ cosφ = z, and z goes up to r = ρ sinφ. So ρ cosφ &lt;= ρ sinφ =&gt; tanφ &gt;= 1 =&gt; φ &gt;= π/4, but since z is going from 0 to r, that would mean φ is between π/4 (when z=r) and π/2 (when z=0). Wait, but ρ is a variable here. Maybe I need to parametrize this.

Alternatively, maybe cylindrical coordinates would be better here. Let me try cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, z = z. The Jacobian is r.

The limits:

Original x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, so in cylindrical coordinates, θ goes from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, which is the line y=x in the first quadrant, so θ from 0 to π/4. Then r would go from 0 to something? Wait, x goes from 0 to 1, and y from 0 to x. Let me visualize this in the xy-plane. When x is from 0 to 1, and for each x, y is from 0 to x. So this is a triangular region in the xy-plane bounded by x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, which is the same as θ from 0 to π/4 and r from 0 to secθ, because x = r cosθ, so r = x / cosθ. When x=1, r = 1 / cosθ. So in cylindrical coordinates, the r limits would be from 0 to 1 / cosθ, but θ from 0 to π/4. Wait, let me verify:

If we fix θ, then in the original limits, y goes from 0 to x. In cylindrical coordinates, y = r sinθ and x = r cosθ. So y &lt;= x implies r sinθ &lt;= r cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4. That&#x27;s correct. So θ ranges from 0 to π/4. Then, for each θ, x goes from 0 to 1. Since x = r cosθ, then r cosθ goes from 0 to 1. So r goes from 0 to 1 / cosθ. Therefore, in cylindrical coordinates, the limits would be θ from 0 to π/4, r from 0 to 1 / cosθ, and z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = r.

So the z limits in cylindrical coordinates are from 0 to r. Then, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} / (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = (r^2)^{3/2} / (r^2 + z^2) = r^3 / (r^2 + z^2). Then, the integral becomes:

∫ (θ=0 to π/4) ∫ (r=0 to 1/cosθ) ∫ (z=0 to r) [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r dz dr dθ

Wait, the Jacobian is r, so the integrand becomes [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r = r^4 / (r^2 + z^2). So the integral in cylindrical coordinates is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

Hmm, is this easier than the original Cartesian integral? The original integral had a complicated integrand, but maybe in cylindrical coordinates, integrating with respect to z first might be manageable.

Alternatively, in spherical coordinates, let&#x27;s see. The integrand becomes ρ sin^3φ, and the Jacobian is ρ^2 sinφ, so overall ρ^3 sin^4φ. The limits in spherical coordinates would require figuring out ρ, φ, θ.

First, θ is from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, similar to cylindrical coordinates.

φ is from π/4 to π/2 because z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) to the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) (φ=π/4).

ρ is a bit trickier. For each direction (θ, φ), ρ starts at 0 and goes out to the maximum value within the region. But the original x goes up to 1. Let&#x27;s see. In spherical coordinates, x = ρ sinφ cosθ. The original x goes from 0 to 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;= 1. Therefore, ρ &lt;= 1 / (sinφ cosθ). But this seems complicated. However, the original limits also have y &lt;= x, which in spherical coordinates is ρ sinφ sinθ &lt;= ρ sinφ cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4, as before. So θ is from 0 to π/4. The upper limit for x is 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;=1. So ρ &lt;= 1/(sinφ cosθ). So in spherical coordinates, the integral would be:

∫_{θ=0}^{π/4} ∫_{φ=π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{ρ=0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ \, dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, integrating ρ^3 is straightforward, but the upper limit for ρ is 1/(sinφ cosθ), which when integrated would lead to terms with 1/(sinφ cosθ)^4, which might complicate things. Then integrating over φ and θ could be messy. So maybe spherical coordinates aren&#x27;t the best here.

Alternatively, in cylindrical coordinates, after integrating z first, maybe it&#x27;s manageable.

So let&#x27;s stick with cylindrical coordinates for now. Let me write out the integral again:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

So first, integrate with respect to z:

Let’s compute the inner integral ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz

Since r is treated as a constant with respect to z, this becomes r^4 ∫_{0}^{r} 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz

The integral of 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz is (1/r) arctan(z/r) ) + C

So evaluating from 0 to r:

(1/r) [ arctan(r/r) - arctan(0/r) ] = (1/r)[ arctan(1) - arctan(0) ] = (1/r)(π/4 - 0) = π/(4r)

Therefore, the inner integral becomes r^4 * π/(4r) = (π/4) r^3

So now, the integral reduces to:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} (π/4) r^3 dr dθ

= (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr ] dθ

Compute the integral over r:

∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr = [ (1/4) r^4 ] from 0 to 1/cosθ = (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So now:

I = (π/4) * (1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} (1/cosθ)^4 dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Hmm, integrating sec^4θ. The integral of sec^4θ dθ is a standard integral. Recall that ∫ sec^nθ dθ can be done using reduction formulas or using substitution. Let me recall:

∫ sec^4θ dθ = ∫ sec^2θ * sec^2θ dθ. Let’s use the identity sec^2θ = 1 + tan^2θ.

So:

= ∫ (1 + tan^2θ) sec^2θ dθ

Let u = tanθ, then du = sec^2θ dθ. Then the integral becomes:

∫ (1 + u^2) du = u + (1/3)u^3 + C = tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ + C

Therefore, the integral of sec^4θ dθ from 0 to π/4 is:

[ tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ ] from 0 to π/4

At π/4: tan(π/4) = 1, so 1 + (1/3)(1)^3 = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3

At 0: tan(0) = 0, so 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, the integral is 4/3 - 0 = 4/3

Therefore, I = (π/16) * (4/3) = π/12

So the final result is π/12.

Wait, let me verify once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make any mistakes.

Starting from the original integral:

Converted to cylindrical coordinates, ended up with:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz dr dθ

Integrated over z first:

Integral over z gives (π/4) r^3

Then integrated over r:

(1/4) r^4 evaluated from 0 to 1/cosθ gives (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So I becomes (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ = (π/16)*(4/3) = π/12

That seems correct. Let me check if converting to spherical coordinates would have been easier. Let me try that approach as a sanity check.

In spherical coordinates, the integral is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

First, integrate over ρ:

∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 dρ = [ (1/4) ρ^4 ] from 0 to 1/(sinφ cosθ) = (1/4)(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4

So the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} (1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 sin^4φ dφ dθ

Simplify the integrand:

(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 * sin^4φ = (1/sin^4φ cos^4θ) * sin^4φ = 1/(cos^4θ) * 1

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ ] / cos^4θ dθ

But wait, integrating over φ from π/4 to π/2:

∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ = π/2 - π/4 = π/4

Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

(1/4) * (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} 1/cos^4θ dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Which is exactly the same as in cylindrical coordinates! So indeed, the spherical coordinate approach also leads to the same integral, which evaluates to π/12. Therefore, both coordinate systems lead to the same result, but cylindrical coordinates perhaps made it a bit more straightforward because the limits for z were simpler.

So in conclusion, the integral simplifies to π/12 when converted to cylindrical coordinates (or spherical, but cylindrical was perhaps easier here). Therefore, the answer is π/12.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To convert the given triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical coordinates, we start by analyzing the region of integration and the integrand. The integral is:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

The region of integration is bounded by the cone \( z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the xy-plane. In cylindrical coordinates, this region is described by \( 0 \leq r \leq \frac{1}{\cos\theta} \), \( 0 \leq z \leq r \), and \( 0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{4} \).

The integrand in cylindrical coordinates becomes:
\[
\frac{(r^2)^{3/2}}{r^2 + z^2} = \frac{r^3}{r^2 + z^2}
\]

Including the Jacobian determinant \( r \), the integral transforms to:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( z \):
\[
\int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz = r^4 \left[ \frac{1}{r} \arctan\left(\frac{z}{r}\right) \right]_{0}^{r} = r^4 \left( \frac{\pi}{4r} \right) = \frac{\pi}{4} r^3
\]

Next, integrate with respect to \( r \):
\[
\int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \frac{\pi}{4} r^3 \, dr = \frac{\pi}{4} \left[ \frac{r^4}{4} \right]_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} = \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta
\]

Finally, integrate with respect to \( \theta \):
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{16} \int_{0}^{\pi/4} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta
\]

Using the substitution \( u = \tan\theta \), the integral of \( \sec^4\theta \) is evaluated as:
\[
\int \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \tan\theta + \frac{1}{3} \tan^3\theta \Big|_{0}^{\pi/4} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Thus, the integral simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\pi}{16} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{\pi}{12}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to convert this triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to either cylindrical or spherical coordinates. The integral is given as:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

First, I should probably understand the region of integration and see which coordinate system—cylindrical or spherical—would make things simpler. Let me start by analyzing the limits of integration.

Looking at the outermost integral, x goes from 0 to 1. Then, for each x, y goes from 0 to x. So in the xy-plane, this is a triangular region where y ranges from 0 to x, and x itself goes up to 1. Then, for each (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). That upper limit for z is interesting—it&#x27;s the equation of a cone, right? Because in Cartesian coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is a cone opening upwards with its vertex at the origin. So the region of integration is bounded below by the xy-plane (z=0) and above by this cone.

So, visualizing this, we have a region that&#x27;s a portion of a cone. Now, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} divided by (x^2 + y^2 + z^2). Let&#x27;s note that x^2 + y^2 is r^2 in cylindrical coordinates, and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is r^2 in spherical coordinates (but r in spherical is different from cylindrical). Hmm, so maybe spherical coordinates could help here because the denominator is the square of the distance from the origin, i.e., the radius in spherical coordinates.

But wait, the numerator is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} which is r^3 in cylindrical coordinates. The denominator is (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) which is r^2 in spherical coordinates (if we use r for spherical as the radial distance). So maybe converting to spherical coordinates would make the integrand simplify nicely. Let me check.

Alternatively, cylindrical coordinates might also work. Let&#x27;s consider both options.

First, let&#x27;s recall the conversions:

Cylindrical coordinates:
x = r cosθ
y = r sinθ
z = z
Jacobian determinant is r.

Spherical coordinates:
x = ρ sinφ cosθ
y = ρ sinφ sinθ
z = ρ cosφ
Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ.

Given the integrand involves both (x^2 + y^2) and (x^2 + y^2 + z^2), perhaps spherical coordinates would be better, since in spherical coordinates, x^2 + y^2 = ρ^2 sin^2φ and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = ρ^2. So substituting these into the integrand:

Numerator: (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} = (ρ^2 sin^2φ)^{3/2} = ρ^3 sin^3φ

Denominator: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = ρ^2

So the integrand becomes ρ^3 sin^3φ / ρ^2 = ρ sin^3φ

Then, the integrand simplifies to ρ sin^3φ. The Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ, so the entire integral in spherical coordinates would be:

∫∫∫ (ρ sin^3φ) * ρ^2 sinφ dρ dφ dθ = ∫∫∫ ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, that seems manageable. But let&#x27;s check the limits of integration in spherical coordinates.

Original limits:

x from 0 to 1

y from 0 to x

z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

First, in spherical coordinates, the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) becomes ρ cosφ = sqrt(ρ^2 sin^2φ) = ρ sinφ. So:

ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ =&gt; cosφ = sinφ =&gt; tanφ = 1 =&gt; φ = π/4

So the upper limit for z is the cone φ = π/4. The lower limit for z is 0, which corresponds to φ = π/2 (the xy-plane), but wait, no. Wait, z goes from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). When z=0, that&#x27;s the xy-plane (φ=π/2). The upper limit is the cone φ=π/4. So in spherical coordinates, φ would go from π/4 to π/2. Wait, let me check:

In spherical coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is equivalent to ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ, so φ = π/4 as above. So for each (x, y), z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) up to the cone at φ=π/4. But actually, in spherical coordinates, varying z with fixed x and y corresponds to moving along a line of constant θ and φ? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. For a given (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). So in spherical terms, for a given radius in the xy-plane (r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)), z goes from 0 up to r. So in spherical coordinates, that would translate to ρ cosφ = z, and z goes up to r = ρ sinφ. So ρ cosφ &lt;= ρ sinφ =&gt; tanφ &gt;= 1 =&gt; φ &gt;= π/4, but since z is going from 0 to r, that would mean φ is between π/4 (when z=r) and π/2 (when z=0). Wait, but ρ is a variable here. Maybe I need to parametrize this.

Alternatively, maybe cylindrical coordinates would be better here. Let me try cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, z = z. The Jacobian is r.

The limits:

Original x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, so in cylindrical coordinates, θ goes from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, which is the line y=x in the first quadrant, so θ from 0 to π/4. Then r would go from 0 to something? Wait, x goes from 0 to 1, and y from 0 to x. Let me visualize this in the xy-plane. When x is from 0 to 1, and for each x, y is from 0 to x. So this is a triangular region in the xy-plane bounded by x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, which is the same as θ from 0 to π/4 and r from 0 to secθ, because x = r cosθ, so r = x / cosθ. When x=1, r = 1 / cosθ. So in cylindrical coordinates, the r limits would be from 0 to 1 / cosθ, but θ from 0 to π/4. Wait, let me verify:

If we fix θ, then in the original limits, y goes from 0 to x. In cylindrical coordinates, y = r sinθ and x = r cosθ. So y &lt;= x implies r sinθ &lt;= r cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4. That&#x27;s correct. So θ ranges from 0 to π/4. Then, for each θ, x goes from 0 to 1. Since x = r cosθ, then r cosθ goes from 0 to 1. So r goes from 0 to 1 / cosθ. Therefore, in cylindrical coordinates, the limits would be θ from 0 to π/4, r from 0 to 1 / cosθ, and z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = r.

So the z limits in cylindrical coordinates are from 0 to r. Then, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} / (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = (r^2)^{3/2} / (r^2 + z^2) = r^3 / (r^2 + z^2). Then, the integral becomes:

∫ (θ=0 to π/4) ∫ (r=0 to 1/cosθ) ∫ (z=0 to r) [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r dz dr dθ

Wait, the Jacobian is r, so the integrand becomes [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r = r^4 / (r^2 + z^2). So the integral in cylindrical coordinates is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

Hmm, is this easier than the original Cartesian integral? The original integral had a complicated integrand, but maybe in cylindrical coordinates, integrating with respect to z first might be manageable.

Alternatively, in spherical coordinates, let&#x27;s see. The integrand becomes ρ sin^3φ, and the Jacobian is ρ^2 sinφ, so overall ρ^3 sin^4φ. The limits in spherical coordinates would require figuring out ρ, φ, θ.

First, θ is from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, similar to cylindrical coordinates.

φ is from π/4 to π/2 because z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) to the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) (φ=π/4).

ρ is a bit trickier. For each direction (θ, φ), ρ starts at 0 and goes out to the maximum value within the region. But the original x goes up to 1. Let&#x27;s see. In spherical coordinates, x = ρ sinφ cosθ. The original x goes from 0 to 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;= 1. Therefore, ρ &lt;= 1 / (sinφ cosθ). But this seems complicated. However, the original limits also have y &lt;= x, which in spherical coordinates is ρ sinφ sinθ &lt;= ρ sinφ cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4, as before. So θ is from 0 to π/4. The upper limit for x is 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;=1. So ρ &lt;= 1/(sinφ cosθ). So in spherical coordinates, the integral would be:

∫_{θ=0}^{π/4} ∫_{φ=π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{ρ=0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ \, dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, integrating ρ^3 is straightforward, but the upper limit for ρ is 1/(sinφ cosθ), which when integrated would lead to terms with 1/(sinφ cosθ)^4, which might complicate things. Then integrating over φ and θ could be messy. So maybe spherical coordinates aren&#x27;t the best here.

Alternatively, in cylindrical coordinates, after integrating z first, maybe it&#x27;s manageable.

So let&#x27;s stick with cylindrical coordinates for now. Let me write out the integral again:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

So first, integrate with respect to z:

Let’s compute the inner integral ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz

Since r is treated as a constant with respect to z, this becomes r^4 ∫_{0}^{r} 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz

The integral of 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz is (1/r) arctan(z/r) ) + C

So evaluating from 0 to r:

(1/r) [ arctan(r/r) - arctan(0/r) ] = (1/r)[ arctan(1) - arctan(0) ] = (1/r)(π/4 - 0) = π/(4r)

Therefore, the inner integral becomes r^4 * π/(4r) = (π/4) r^3

So now, the integral reduces to:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} (π/4) r^3 dr dθ

= (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr ] dθ

Compute the integral over r:

∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr = [ (1/4) r^4 ] from 0 to 1/cosθ = (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So now:

I = (π/4) * (1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} (1/cosθ)^4 dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Hmm, integrating sec^4θ. The integral of sec^4θ dθ is a standard integral. Recall that ∫ sec^nθ dθ can be done using reduction formulas or using substitution. Let me recall:

∫ sec^4θ dθ = ∫ sec^2θ * sec^2θ dθ. Let’s use the identity sec^2θ = 1 + tan^2θ.

So:

= ∫ (1 + tan^2θ) sec^2θ dθ

Let u = tanθ, then du = sec^2θ dθ. Then the integral becomes:

∫ (1 + u^2) du = u + (1/3)u^3 + C = tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ + C

Therefore, the integral of sec^4θ dθ from 0 to π/4 is:

[ tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ ] from 0 to π/4

At π/4: tan(π/4) = 1, so 1 + (1/3)(1)^3 = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3

At 0: tan(0) = 0, so 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, the integral is 4/3 - 0 = 4/3

Therefore, I = (π/16) * (4/3) = π/12

So the final result is π/12.

Wait, let me verify once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make any mistakes.

Starting from the original integral:

Converted to cylindrical coordinates, ended up with:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz dr dθ

Integrated over z first:

Integral over z gives (π/4) r^3

Then integrated over r:

(1/4) r^4 evaluated from 0 to 1/cosθ gives (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So I becomes (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ = (π/16)*(4/3) = π/12

That seems correct. Let me check if converting to spherical coordinates would have been easier. Let me try that approach as a sanity check.

In spherical coordinates, the integral is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

First, integrate over ρ:

∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 dρ = [ (1/4) ρ^4 ] from 0 to 1/(sinφ cosθ) = (1/4)(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4

So the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} (1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 sin^4φ dφ dθ

Simplify the integrand:

(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 * sin^4φ = (1/sin^4φ cos^4θ) * sin^4φ = 1/(cos^4θ) * 1

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ ] / cos^4θ dθ

But wait, integrating over φ from π/4 to π/2:

∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ = π/2 - π/4 = π/4

Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

(1/4) * (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} 1/cos^4θ dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Which is exactly the same as in cylindrical coordinates! So indeed, the spherical coordinate approach also leads to the same integral, which evaluates to π/12. Therefore, both coordinate systems lead to the same result, but cylindrical coordinates perhaps made it a bit more straightforward because the limits for z were simpler.

So in conclusion, the integral simplifies to π/12 when converted to cylindrical coordinates (or spherical, but cylindrical was perhaps easier here). Therefore, the answer is π/12.

To convert the given triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical coordinates, we start by analyzing the region of integration and the integrand. The integral is:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

The region of integration is bounded by the cone \( z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the xy-plane. In cylindrical coordinates, this region is described by \( 0 \leq r \leq \frac{1}{\cos\theta} \), \( 0 \leq z \leq r \), and \( 0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{4} \).

The integrand in cylindrical coordinates becomes:
\[
\frac{(r^2)^{3/2}}{r^2 + z^2} = \frac{r^3}{r^2 + z^2}
\]

Including the Jacobian determinant \( r \), the integral transforms to:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( z \):
\[
\int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz = r^4 \left[ \frac{1}{r} \arctan\left(\frac{z}{r}\right) \right]_{0}^{r} = r^4 \left( \frac{\pi}{4r} \right) = \frac{\pi}{4} r^3
\]

Next, integrate with respect to \( r \):
\[
\int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \frac{\pi}{4} r^3 \, dr = \frac{\pi}{4} \left[ \frac{r^4}{4} \right]_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} = \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta
\]

Finally, integrate with respect to \( \theta \):
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{16} \int_{0}^{\pi/4} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta
\]

Using the substitution \( u = \tan\theta \), the integral of \( \sec^4\theta \) is evaluated as:
\[
\int \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \tan\theta + \frac{1}{3} \tan^3\theta \Big|_{0}^{\pi/4} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Thus, the integral simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\pi}{16} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{\pi}{12}
\]

The final answer is:
\[

So the integrand becomes ρ^3 sin^3φ / ρ^2 = ρ sin^3φ

Then, the integrand simplifies to ρ sin^3φ. The Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ, so the entire integral in spherical coordinates would be:

∫∫∫ (ρ sin^3φ) * ρ^2 sinφ dρ dφ dθ = ∫∫∫ ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, that seems manageable. But let&#x27;s check the limits of integration in spherical coordinates.

Original limits:

x from 0 to 1

y from 0 to x

z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

First, in spherical coordinates, the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) becomes ρ cosφ = sqrt(ρ^2 sin^2φ) = ρ sinφ. So:

ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ =&gt; cosφ = sinφ =&gt; tanφ = 1 =&gt; φ = π/4

So the upper limit for z is the cone φ = π/4. The lower limit for z is 0, which corresponds to φ = π/2 (the xy-plane), but wait, no. Wait, z goes from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). When z=0, that&#x27;s the xy-plane (φ=π/2). The upper limit is the cone φ=π/4. So in spherical coordinates, φ would go from π/4 to π/2. Wait, let me check:

In spherical coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is equivalent to ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ, so φ = π/4 as above. So for each (x, y), z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) up to the cone at φ=π/4. But actually, in spherical coordinates, varying z with fixed x and y corresponds to moving along a line of constant θ and φ? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. For a given (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). So in spherical terms, for a given radius in the xy-plane (r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)), z goes from 0 up to r. So in spherical coordinates, that would translate to ρ cosφ = z, and z goes up to r = ρ sinφ. So ρ cosφ &lt;= ρ sinφ =&gt; tanφ &gt;= 1 =&gt; φ &gt;= π/4, but since z is going from 0 to r, that would mean φ is between π/4 (when z=r) and π/2 (when z=0). Wait, but ρ is a variable here. Maybe I need to parametrize this.

Alternatively, maybe cylindrical coordinates would be better here. Let me try cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, z = z. The Jacobian is r.

The limits:

Original x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, so in cylindrical coordinates, θ goes from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, which is the line y=x in the first quadrant, so θ from 0 to π/4. Then r would go from 0 to something? Wait, x goes from 0 to 1, and y from 0 to x. Let me visualize this in the xy-plane. When x is from 0 to 1, and for each x, y is from 0 to x. So this is a triangular region in the xy-plane bounded by x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, which is the same as θ from 0 to π/4 and r from 0 to secθ, because x = r cosθ, so r = x / cosθ. When x=1, r = 1 / cosθ. So in cylindrical coordinates, the r limits would be from 0 to 1 / cosθ, but θ from 0 to π/4. Wait, let me verify:

If we fix θ, then in the original limits, y goes from 0 to x. In cylindrical coordinates, y = r sinθ and x = r cosθ. So y &lt;= x implies r sinθ &lt;= r cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4. That&#x27;s correct. So θ ranges from 0 to π/4. Then, for each θ, x goes from 0 to 1. Since x = r cosθ, then r cosθ goes from 0 to 1. So r goes from 0 to 1 / cosθ. Therefore, in cylindrical coordinates, the limits would be θ from 0 to π/4, r from 0 to 1 / cosθ, and z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = r.

So the z limits in cylindrical coordinates are from 0 to r. Then, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} / (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = (r^2)^{3/2} / (r^2 + z^2) = r^3 / (r^2 + z^2). Then, the integral becomes:

∫ (θ=0 to π/4) ∫ (r=0 to 1/cosθ) ∫ (z=0 to r) [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r dz dr dθ

Wait, the Jacobian is r, so the integrand becomes [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r = r^4 / (r^2 + z^2). So the integral in cylindrical coordinates is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

Hmm, is this easier than the original Cartesian integral? The original integral had a complicated integrand, but maybe in cylindrical coordinates, integrating with respect to z first might be manageable.

Alternatively, in spherical coordinates, let&#x27;s see. The integrand becomes ρ sin^3φ, and the Jacobian is ρ^2 sinφ, so overall ρ^3 sin^4φ. The limits in spherical coordinates would require figuring out ρ, φ, θ.

First, θ is from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, similar to cylindrical coordinates.

φ is from π/4 to π/2 because z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) to the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) (φ=π/4).

ρ is a bit trickier. For each direction (θ, φ), ρ starts at 0 and goes out to the maximum value within the region. But the original x goes up to 1. Let&#x27;s see. In spherical coordinates, x = ρ sinφ cosθ. The original x goes from 0 to 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;= 1. Therefore, ρ &lt;= 1 / (sinφ cosθ). But this seems complicated. However, the original limits also have y &lt;= x, which in spherical coordinates is ρ sinφ sinθ &lt;= ρ sinφ cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4, as before. So θ is from 0 to π/4. The upper limit for x is 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;=1. So ρ &lt;= 1/(sinφ cosθ). So in spherical coordinates, the integral would be:

∫_{θ=0}^{π/4} ∫_{φ=π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{ρ=0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ \, dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, integrating ρ^3 is straightforward, but the upper limit for ρ is 1/(sinφ cosθ), which when integrated would lead to terms with 1/(sinφ cosθ)^4, which might complicate things. Then integrating over φ and θ could be messy. So maybe spherical coordinates aren&#x27;t the best here.

Alternatively, in cylindrical coordinates, after integrating z first, maybe it&#x27;s manageable.

So let&#x27;s stick with cylindrical coordinates for now. Let me write out the integral again:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

So first, integrate with respect to z:

Let’s compute the inner integral ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz

Since r is treated as a constant with respect to z, this becomes r^4 ∫_{0}^{r} 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz

The integral of 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz is (1/r) arctan(z/r) ) + C

So evaluating from 0 to r:

(1/r) [ arctan(r/r) - arctan(0/r) ] = (1/r)[ arctan(1) - arctan(0) ] = (1/r)(π/4 - 0) = π/(4r)

Therefore, the inner integral becomes r^4 * π/(4r) = (π/4) r^3

So now, the integral reduces to:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} (π/4) r^3 dr dθ

= (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr ] dθ

Compute the integral over r:

∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr = [ (1/4) r^4 ] from 0 to 1/cosθ = (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So now:

I = (π/4) * (1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} (1/cosθ)^4 dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Hmm, integrating sec^4θ. The integral of sec^4θ dθ is a standard integral. Recall that ∫ sec^nθ dθ can be done using reduction formulas or using substitution. Let me recall:

∫ sec^4θ dθ = ∫ sec^2θ * sec^2θ dθ. Let’s use the identity sec^2θ = 1 + tan^2θ.

So:

= ∫ (1 + tan^2θ) sec^2θ dθ

Let u = tanθ, then du = sec^2θ dθ. Then the integral becomes:

∫ (1 + u^2) du = u + (1/3)u^3 + C = tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ + C

Therefore, the integral of sec^4θ dθ from 0 to π/4 is:

[ tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ ] from 0 to π/4

At π/4: tan(π/4) = 1, so 1 + (1/3)(1)^3 = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3

At 0: tan(0) = 0, so 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, the integral is 4/3 - 0 = 4/3

Therefore, I = (π/16) * (4/3) = π/12

So the final result is π/12.

Wait, let me verify once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make any mistakes.

Starting from the original integral:

Converted to cylindrical coordinates, ended up with:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz dr dθ

Integrated over z first:

Integral over z gives (π/4) r^3

Then integrated over r:

(1/4) r^4 evaluated from 0 to 1/cosθ gives (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So I becomes (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ = (π/16)*(4/3) = π/12

That seems correct. Let me check if converting to spherical coordinates would have been easier. Let me try that approach as a sanity check.

In spherical coordinates, the integral is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

First, integrate over ρ:

∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 dρ = [ (1/4) ρ^4 ] from 0 to 1/(sinφ cosθ) = (1/4)(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4

So the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} (1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 sin^4φ dφ dθ

Simplify the integrand:

(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 * sin^4φ = (1/sin^4φ cos^4θ) * sin^4φ = 1/(cos^4θ) * 1

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ ] / cos^4θ dθ

But wait, integrating over φ from π/4 to π/2:

∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ = π/2 - π/4 = π/4

Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

(1/4) * (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} 1/cos^4θ dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Which is exactly the same as in cylindrical coordinates! So indeed, the spherical coordinate approach also leads to the same integral, which evaluates to π/12. Therefore, both coordinate systems lead to the same result, but cylindrical coordinates perhaps made it a bit more straightforward because the limits for z were simpler.

So in conclusion, the integral simplifies to π/12 when converted to cylindrical coordinates (or spherical, but cylindrical was perhaps easier here). Therefore, the answer is π/12.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To convert the given triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical coordinates, we start by analyzing the region of integration and the integrand. The integral is:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

The region of integration is bounded by the cone \( z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the xy-plane. In cylindrical coordinates, this region is described by \( 0 \leq r \leq \frac{1}{\cos\theta} \), \( 0 \leq z \leq r \), and \( 0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{4} \).

The integrand in cylindrical coordinates becomes:
\[
\frac{(r^2)^{3/2}}{r^2 + z^2} = \frac{r^3}{r^2 + z^2}
\]

Including the Jacobian determinant \( r \), the integral transforms to:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( z \):
\[
\int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz = r^4 \left[ \frac{1}{r} \arctan\left(\frac{z}{r}\right) \right]_{0}^{r} = r^4 \left( \frac{\pi}{4r} \right) = \frac{\pi}{4} r^3
\]

Next, integrate with respect to \( r \):
\[
\int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \frac{\pi}{4} r^3 \, dr = \frac{\pi}{4} \left[ \frac{r^4}{4} \right]_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} = \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta
\]

Finally, integrate with respect to \( \theta \):
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{16} \int_{0}^{\pi/4} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta
\]

Using the substitution \( u = \tan\theta \), the integral of \( \sec^4\theta \) is evaluated as:
\[
\int \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \tan\theta + \frac{1}{3} \tan^3\theta \Big|_{0}^{\pi/4} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Thus, the integral simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\pi}{16} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{\pi}{12}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to convert this triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to either cylindrical or spherical coordinates. The integral is given as:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

First, I should probably understand the region of integration and see which coordinate system—cylindrical or spherical—would make things simpler. Let me start by analyzing the limits of integration.

Looking at the outermost integral, x goes from 0 to 1. Then, for each x, y goes from 0 to x. So in the xy-plane, this is a triangular region where y ranges from 0 to x, and x itself goes up to 1. Then, for each (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). That upper limit for z is interesting—it&#x27;s the equation of a cone, right? Because in Cartesian coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is a cone opening upwards with its vertex at the origin. So the region of integration is bounded below by the xy-plane (z=0) and above by this cone.

So, visualizing this, we have a region that&#x27;s a portion of a cone. Now, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} divided by (x^2 + y^2 + z^2). Let&#x27;s note that x^2 + y^2 is r^2 in cylindrical coordinates, and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is r^2 in spherical coordinates (but r in spherical is different from cylindrical). Hmm, so maybe spherical coordinates could help here because the denominator is the square of the distance from the origin, i.e., the radius in spherical coordinates.

But wait, the numerator is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} which is r^3 in cylindrical coordinates. The denominator is (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) which is r^2 in spherical coordinates (if we use r for spherical as the radial distance). So maybe converting to spherical coordinates would make the integrand simplify nicely. Let me check.

Alternatively, cylindrical coordinates might also work. Let&#x27;s consider both options.

First, let&#x27;s recall the conversions:

Cylindrical coordinates:
x = r cosθ
y = r sinθ
z = z
Jacobian determinant is r.

Spherical coordinates:
x = ρ sinφ cosθ
y = ρ sinφ sinθ
z = ρ cosφ
Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ.

Given the integrand involves both (x^2 + y^2) and (x^2 + y^2 + z^2), perhaps spherical coordinates would be better, since in spherical coordinates, x^2 + y^2 = ρ^2 sin^2φ and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = ρ^2. So substituting these into the integrand:

Numerator: (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} = (ρ^2 sin^2φ)^{3/2} = ρ^3 sin^3φ

Denominator: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = ρ^2

So the integrand becomes ρ^3 sin^3φ / ρ^2 = ρ sin^3φ

Then, the integrand simplifies to ρ sin^3φ. The Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ, so the entire integral in spherical coordinates would be:

∫∫∫ (ρ sin^3φ) * ρ^2 sinφ dρ dφ dθ = ∫∫∫ ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, that seems manageable. But let&#x27;s check the limits of integration in spherical coordinates.

Original limits:

x from 0 to 1

y from 0 to x

z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

First, in spherical coordinates, the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) becomes ρ cosφ = sqrt(ρ^2 sin^2φ) = ρ sinφ. So:

ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ =&gt; cosφ = sinφ =&gt; tanφ = 1 =&gt; φ = π/4

So the upper limit for z is the cone φ = π/4. The lower limit for z is 0, which corresponds to φ = π/2 (the xy-plane), but wait, no. Wait, z goes from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). When z=0, that&#x27;s the xy-plane (φ=π/2). The upper limit is the cone φ=π/4. So in spherical coordinates, φ would go from π/4 to π/2. Wait, let me check:

In spherical coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is equivalent to ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ, so φ = π/4 as above. So for each (x, y), z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) up to the cone at φ=π/4. But actually, in spherical coordinates, varying z with fixed x and y corresponds to moving along a line of constant θ and φ? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. For a given (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). So in spherical terms, for a given radius in the xy-plane (r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)), z goes from 0 up to r. So in spherical coordinates, that would translate to ρ cosφ = z, and z goes up to r = ρ sinφ. So ρ cosφ &lt;= ρ sinφ =&gt; tanφ &gt;= 1 =&gt; φ &gt;= π/4, but since z is going from 0 to r, that would mean φ is between π/4 (when z=r) and π/2 (when z=0). Wait, but ρ is a variable here. Maybe I need to parametrize this.

Alternatively, maybe cylindrical coordinates would be better here. Let me try cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, z = z. The Jacobian is r.

The limits:

Original x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, so in cylindrical coordinates, θ goes from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, which is the line y=x in the first quadrant, so θ from 0 to π/4. Then r would go from 0 to something? Wait, x goes from 0 to 1, and y from 0 to x. Let me visualize this in the xy-plane. When x is from 0 to 1, and for each x, y is from 0 to x. So this is a triangular region in the xy-plane bounded by x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, which is the same as θ from 0 to π/4 and r from 0 to secθ, because x = r cosθ, so r = x / cosθ. When x=1, r = 1 / cosθ. So in cylindrical coordinates, the r limits would be from 0 to 1 / cosθ, but θ from 0 to π/4. Wait, let me verify:

If we fix θ, then in the original limits, y goes from 0 to x. In cylindrical coordinates, y = r sinθ and x = r cosθ. So y &lt;= x implies r sinθ &lt;= r cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4. That&#x27;s correct. So θ ranges from 0 to π/4. Then, for each θ, x goes from 0 to 1. Since x = r cosθ, then r cosθ goes from 0 to 1. So r goes from 0 to 1 / cosθ. Therefore, in cylindrical coordinates, the limits would be θ from 0 to π/4, r from 0 to 1 / cosθ, and z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = r.

So the z limits in cylindrical coordinates are from 0 to r. Then, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} / (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = (r^2)^{3/2} / (r^2 + z^2) = r^3 / (r^2 + z^2). Then, the integral becomes:

∫ (θ=0 to π/4) ∫ (r=0 to 1/cosθ) ∫ (z=0 to r) [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r dz dr dθ

Wait, the Jacobian is r, so the integrand becomes [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r = r^4 / (r^2 + z^2). So the integral in cylindrical coordinates is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

Hmm, is this easier than the original Cartesian integral? The original integral had a complicated integrand, but maybe in cylindrical coordinates, integrating with respect to z first might be manageable.

Alternatively, in spherical coordinates, let&#x27;s see. The integrand becomes ρ sin^3φ, and the Jacobian is ρ^2 sinφ, so overall ρ^3 sin^4φ. The limits in spherical coordinates would require figuring out ρ, φ, θ.

First, θ is from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, similar to cylindrical coordinates.

φ is from π/4 to π/2 because z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) to the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) (φ=π/4).

ρ is a bit trickier. For each direction (θ, φ), ρ starts at 0 and goes out to the maximum value within the region. But the original x goes up to 1. Let&#x27;s see. In spherical coordinates, x = ρ sinφ cosθ. The original x goes from 0 to 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;= 1. Therefore, ρ &lt;= 1 / (sinφ cosθ). But this seems complicated. However, the original limits also have y &lt;= x, which in spherical coordinates is ρ sinφ sinθ &lt;= ρ sinφ cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4, as before. So θ is from 0 to π/4. The upper limit for x is 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;=1. So ρ &lt;= 1/(sinφ cosθ). So in spherical coordinates, the integral would be:

∫_{θ=0}^{π/4} ∫_{φ=π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{ρ=0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ \, dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, integrating ρ^3 is straightforward, but the upper limit for ρ is 1/(sinφ cosθ), which when integrated would lead to terms with 1/(sinφ cosθ)^4, which might complicate things. Then integrating over φ and θ could be messy. So maybe spherical coordinates aren&#x27;t the best here.

Alternatively, in cylindrical coordinates, after integrating z first, maybe it&#x27;s manageable.

So let&#x27;s stick with cylindrical coordinates for now. Let me write out the integral again:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

So first, integrate with respect to z:

Let’s compute the inner integral ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz

Since r is treated as a constant with respect to z, this becomes r^4 ∫_{0}^{r} 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz

The integral of 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz is (1/r) arctan(z/r) ) + C

So evaluating from 0 to r:

(1/r) [ arctan(r/r) - arctan(0/r) ] = (1/r)[ arctan(1) - arctan(0) ] = (1/r)(π/4 - 0) = π/(4r)

Therefore, the inner integral becomes r^4 * π/(4r) = (π/4) r^3

So now, the integral reduces to:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} (π/4) r^3 dr dθ

= (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr ] dθ

Compute the integral over r:

∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr = [ (1/4) r^4 ] from 0 to 1/cosθ = (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So now:

I = (π/4) * (1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} (1/cosθ)^4 dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Hmm, integrating sec^4θ. The integral of sec^4θ dθ is a standard integral. Recall that ∫ sec^nθ dθ can be done using reduction formulas or using substitution. Let me recall:

∫ sec^4θ dθ = ∫ sec^2θ * sec^2θ dθ. Let’s use the identity sec^2θ = 1 + tan^2θ.

So:

= ∫ (1 + tan^2θ) sec^2θ dθ

Let u = tanθ, then du = sec^2θ dθ. Then the integral becomes:

∫ (1 + u^2) du = u + (1/3)u^3 + C = tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ + C

Therefore, the integral of sec^4θ dθ from 0 to π/4 is:

[ tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ ] from 0 to π/4

At π/4: tan(π/4) = 1, so 1 + (1/3)(1)^3 = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3

At 0: tan(0) = 0, so 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, the integral is 4/3 - 0 = 4/3

Therefore, I = (π/16) * (4/3) = π/12

So the final result is π/12.

Wait, let me verify once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make any mistakes.

Starting from the original integral:

Converted to cylindrical coordinates, ended up with:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz dr dθ

Integrated over z first:

Integral over z gives (π/4) r^3

Then integrated over r:

(1/4) r^4 evaluated from 0 to 1/cosθ gives (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So I becomes (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ = (π/16)*(4/3) = π/12

That seems correct. Let me check if converting to spherical coordinates would have been easier. Let me try that approach as a sanity check.

In spherical coordinates, the integral is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

First, integrate over ρ:

∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 dρ = [ (1/4) ρ^4 ] from 0 to 1/(sinφ cosθ) = (1/4)(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4

So the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} (1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 sin^4φ dφ dθ

Simplify the integrand:

(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 * sin^4φ = (1/sin^4φ cos^4θ) * sin^4φ = 1/(cos^4θ) * 1

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ ] / cos^4θ dθ

But wait, integrating over φ from π/4 to π/2:

∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ = π/2 - π/4 = π/4

Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

(1/4) * (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} 1/cos^4θ dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Which is exactly the same as in cylindrical coordinates! So indeed, the spherical coordinate approach also leads to the same integral, which evaluates to π/12. Therefore, both coordinate systems lead to the same result, but cylindrical coordinates perhaps made it a bit more straightforward because the limits for z were simpler.

So in conclusion, the integral simplifies to π/12 when converted to cylindrical coordinates (or spherical, but cylindrical was perhaps easier here). Therefore, the answer is π/12.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To convert the given triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical coordinates, we start by analyzing the region of integration and the integrand. The integral is:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

The region of integration is bounded by the cone \( z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the xy-plane. In cylindrical coordinates, this region is described by \( 0 \leq r \leq \frac{1}{\cos\theta} \), \( 0 \leq z \leq r \), and \( 0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{4} \).

The integrand in cylindrical coordinates becomes:
\[
\frac{(r^2)^{3/2}}{r^2 + z^2} = \frac{r^3}{r^2 + z^2}
\]

Including the Jacobian determinant \( r \), the integral transforms to:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( z \):
\[
\int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz = r^4 \left[ \frac{1}{r} \arctan\left(\frac{z}{r}\right) \right]_{0}^{r} = r^4 \left( \frac{\pi}{4r} \right) = \frac{\pi}{4} r^3
\]

Next, integrate with respect to \( r \):
\[
\int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \frac{\pi}{4} r^3 \, dr = \frac{\pi}{4} \left[ \frac{r^4}{4} \right]_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} = \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta
\]

Finally, integrate with respect to \( \theta \):
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{16} \int_{0}^{\pi/4} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta
\]

Using the substitution \( u = \tan\theta \), the integral of \( \sec^4\theta \) is evaluated as:
\[
\int \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \tan\theta + \frac{1}{3} \tan^3\theta \Big|_{0}^{\pi/4} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Thus, the integral simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\pi}{16} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{\pi}{12}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to convert this triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to either cylindrical or spherical coordinates. The integral is given as:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

First, I should probably understand the region of integration and see which coordinate system—cylindrical or spherical—would make things simpler. Let me start by analyzing the limits of integration.

Looking at the outermost integral, x goes from 0 to 1. Then, for each x, y goes from 0 to x. So in the xy-plane, this is a triangular region where y ranges from 0 to x, and x itself goes up to 1. Then, for each (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). That upper limit for z is interesting—it&#x27;s the equation of a cone, right? Because in Cartesian coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is a cone opening upwards with its vertex at the origin. So the region of integration is bounded below by the xy-plane (z=0) and above by this cone.

So, visualizing this, we have a region that&#x27;s a portion of a cone. Now, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} divided by (x^2 + y^2 + z^2). Let&#x27;s note that x^2 + y^2 is r^2 in cylindrical coordinates, and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is r^2 in spherical coordinates (but r in spherical is different from cylindrical). Hmm, so maybe spherical coordinates could help here because the denominator is the square of the distance from the origin, i.e., the radius in spherical coordinates.

But wait, the numerator is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} which is r^3 in cylindrical coordinates. The denominator is (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) which is r^2 in spherical coordinates (if we use r for spherical as the radial distance). So maybe converting to spherical coordinates would make the integrand simplify nicely. Let me check.

Alternatively, cylindrical coordinates might also work. Let&#x27;s consider both options.

First, let&#x27;s recall the conversions:

Cylindrical coordinates:
x = r cosθ
y = r sinθ
z = z
Jacobian determinant is r.

Spherical coordinates:
x = ρ sinφ cosθ
y = ρ sinφ sinθ
z = ρ cosφ
Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ.

Given the integrand involves both (x^2 + y^2) and (x^2 + y^2 + z^2), perhaps spherical coordinates would be better, since in spherical coordinates, x^2 + y^2 = ρ^2 sin^2φ and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = ρ^2. So substituting these into the integrand:

Numerator: (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} = (ρ^2 sin^2φ)^{3/2} = ρ^3 sin^3φ

Denominator: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = ρ^2

So the integrand becomes ρ^3 sin^3φ / ρ^2 = ρ sin^3φ

Then, the integrand simplifies to ρ sin^3φ. The Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ, so the entire integral in spherical coordinates would be:

∫∫∫ (ρ sin^3φ) * ρ^2 sinφ dρ dφ dθ = ∫∫∫ ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, that seems manageable. But let&#x27;s check the limits of integration in spherical coordinates.

Original limits:

x from 0 to 1

y from 0 to x

z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

First, in spherical coordinates, the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) becomes ρ cosφ = sqrt(ρ^2 sin^2φ) = ρ sinφ. So:

ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ =&gt; cosφ = sinφ =&gt; tanφ = 1 =&gt; φ = π/4

So the upper limit for z is the cone φ = π/4. The lower limit for z is 0, which corresponds to φ = π/2 (the xy-plane), but wait, no. Wait, z goes from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). When z=0, that&#x27;s the xy-plane (φ=π/2). The upper limit is the cone φ=π/4. So in spherical coordinates, φ would go from π/4 to π/2. Wait, let me check:

In spherical coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is equivalent to ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ, so φ = π/4 as above. So for each (x, y), z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) up to the cone at φ=π/4. But actually, in spherical coordinates, varying z with fixed x and y corresponds to moving along a line of constant θ and φ? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. For a given (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). So in spherical terms, for a given radius in the xy-plane (r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)), z goes from 0 up to r. So in spherical coordinates, that would translate to ρ cosφ = z, and z goes up to r = ρ sinφ. So ρ cosφ &lt;= ρ sinφ =&gt; tanφ &gt;= 1 =&gt; φ &gt;= π/4, but since z is going from 0 to r, that would mean φ is between π/4 (when z=r) and π/2 (when z=0). Wait, but ρ is a variable here. Maybe I need to parametrize this.

Alternatively, maybe cylindrical coordinates would be better here. Let me try cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, z = z. The Jacobian is r.

The limits:

Original x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, so in cylindrical coordinates, θ goes from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, which is the line y=x in the first quadrant, so θ from 0 to π/4. Then r would go from 0 to something? Wait, x goes from 0 to 1, and y from 0 to x. Let me visualize this in the xy-plane. When x is from 0 to 1, and for each x, y is from 0 to x. So this is a triangular region in the xy-plane bounded by x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, which is the same as θ from 0 to π/4 and r from 0 to secθ, because x = r cosθ, so r = x / cosθ. When x=1, r = 1 / cosθ. So in cylindrical coordinates, the r limits would be from 0 to 1 / cosθ, but θ from 0 to π/4. Wait, let me verify:

If we fix θ, then in the original limits, y goes from 0 to x. In cylindrical coordinates, y = r sinθ and x = r cosθ. So y &lt;= x implies r sinθ &lt;= r cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4. That&#x27;s correct. So θ ranges from 0 to π/4. Then, for each θ, x goes from 0 to 1. Since x = r cosθ, then r cosθ goes from 0 to 1. So r goes from 0 to 1 / cosθ. Therefore, in cylindrical coordinates, the limits would be θ from 0 to π/4, r from 0 to 1 / cosθ, and z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = r.

So the z limits in cylindrical coordinates are from 0 to r. Then, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} / (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = (r^2)^{3/2} / (r^2 + z^2) = r^3 / (r^2 + z^2). Then, the integral becomes:

∫ (θ=0 to π/4) ∫ (r=0 to 1/cosθ) ∫ (z=0 to r) [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r dz dr dθ

Wait, the Jacobian is r, so the integrand becomes [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r = r^4 / (r^2 + z^2). So the integral in cylindrical coordinates is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

Hmm, is this easier than the original Cartesian integral? The original integral had a complicated integrand, but maybe in cylindrical coordinates, integrating with respect to z first might be manageable.

Alternatively, in spherical coordinates, let&#x27;s see. The integrand becomes ρ sin^3φ, and the Jacobian is ρ^2 sinφ, so overall ρ^3 sin^4φ. The limits in spherical coordinates would require figuring out ρ, φ, θ.

First, θ is from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, similar to cylindrical coordinates.

φ is from π/4 to π/2 because z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) to the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) (φ=π/4).

ρ is a bit trickier. For each direction (θ, φ), ρ starts at 0 and goes out to the maximum value within the region. But the original x goes up to 1. Let&#x27;s see. In spherical coordinates, x = ρ sinφ cosθ. The original x goes from 0 to 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;= 1. Therefore, ρ &lt;= 1 / (sinφ cosθ). But this seems complicated. However, the original limits also have y &lt;= x, which in spherical coordinates is ρ sinφ sinθ &lt;= ρ sinφ cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4, as before. So θ is from 0 to π/4. The upper limit for x is 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;=1. So ρ &lt;= 1/(sinφ cosθ). So in spherical coordinates, the integral would be:

∫_{θ=0}^{π/4} ∫_{φ=π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{ρ=0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ \, dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, integrating ρ^3 is straightforward, but the upper limit for ρ is 1/(sinφ cosθ), which when integrated would lead to terms with 1/(sinφ cosθ)^4, which might complicate things. Then integrating over φ and θ could be messy. So maybe spherical coordinates aren&#x27;t the best here.

Alternatively, in cylindrical coordinates, after integrating z first, maybe it&#x27;s manageable.

So let&#x27;s stick with cylindrical coordinates for now. Let me write out the integral again:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

So first, integrate with respect to z:

Let’s compute the inner integral ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz

Since r is treated as a constant with respect to z, this becomes r^4 ∫_{0}^{r} 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz

The integral of 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz is (1/r) arctan(z/r) ) + C

So evaluating from 0 to r:

(1/r) [ arctan(r/r) - arctan(0/r) ] = (1/r)[ arctan(1) - arctan(0) ] = (1/r)(π/4 - 0) = π/(4r)

Therefore, the inner integral becomes r^4 * π/(4r) = (π/4) r^3

So now, the integral reduces to:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} (π/4) r^3 dr dθ

= (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr ] dθ

Compute the integral over r:

∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr = [ (1/4) r^4 ] from 0 to 1/cosθ = (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So now:

I = (π/4) * (1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} (1/cosθ)^4 dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Hmm, integrating sec^4θ. The integral of sec^4θ dθ is a standard integral. Recall that ∫ sec^nθ dθ can be done using reduction formulas or using substitution. Let me recall:

∫ sec^4θ dθ = ∫ sec^2θ * sec^2θ dθ. Let’s use the identity sec^2θ = 1 + tan^2θ.

So:

= ∫ (1 + tan^2θ) sec^2θ dθ

Let u = tanθ, then du = sec^2θ dθ. Then the integral becomes:

∫ (1 + u^2) du = u + (1/3)u^3 + C = tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ + C

Therefore, the integral of sec^4θ dθ from 0 to π/4 is:

[ tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ ] from 0 to π/4

At π/4: tan(π/4) = 1, so 1 + (1/3)(1)^3 = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3

At 0: tan(0) = 0, so 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, the integral is 4/3 - 0 = 4/3

Therefore, I = (π/16) * (4/3) = π/12

So the final result is π/12.

Wait, let me verify once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make any mistakes.

Starting from the original integral:

Converted to cylindrical coordinates, ended up with:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz dr dθ

Integrated over z first:

Integral over z gives (π/4) r^3

Then integrated over r:

(1/4) r^4 evaluated from 0 to 1/cosθ gives (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So I becomes (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ = (π/16)*(4/3) = π/12

That seems correct. Let me check if converting to spherical coordinates would have been easier. Let me try that approach as a sanity check.

In spherical coordinates, the integral is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

First, integrate over ρ:

∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 dρ = [ (1/4) ρ^4 ] from 0 to 1/(sinφ cosθ) = (1/4)(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4

So the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} (1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 sin^4φ dφ dθ

Simplify the integrand:

(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 * sin^4φ = (1/sin^4φ cos^4θ) * sin^4φ = 1/(cos^4θ) * 1

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ ] / cos^4θ dθ

But wait, integrating over φ from π/4 to π/2:

∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ = π/2 - π/4 = π/4

Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

(1/4) * (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} 1/cos^4θ dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Which is exactly the same as in cylindrical coordinates! So indeed, the spherical coordinate approach also leads to the same integral, which evaluates to π/12. Therefore, both coordinate systems lead to the same result, but cylindrical coordinates perhaps made it a bit more straightforward because the limits for z were simpler.

So in conclusion, the integral simplifies to π/12 when converted to cylindrical coordinates (or spherical, but cylindrical was perhaps easier here). Therefore, the answer is π/12.

To convert the given triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical coordinates, we start by analyzing the region of integration and the integrand. The integral is:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

The region of integration is bounded by the cone \( z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the xy-plane. In cylindrical coordinates, this region is described by \( 0 \leq r \leq \frac{1}{\cos\theta} \), \( 0 \leq z \leq r \), and \( 0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{4} \).

The integrand in cylindrical coordinates becomes:
\[
\frac{(r^2)^{3/2}}{r^2 + z^2} = \frac{r^3}{r^2 + z^2}
\]

Including the Jacobian determinant \( r \), the integral transforms to:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( z \):
\[
\int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz = r^4 \left[ \frac{1}{r} \arctan\left(\frac{z}{r}\right) \right]_{0}^{r} = r^4 \left( \frac{\pi}{4r} \right) = \frac{\pi}{4} r^3
\]

Next, integrate with respect to \( r \):
\[
\int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \frac{\pi}{4} r^3 \, dr = \frac{\pi}{4} \left[ \frac{r^4}{4} \right]_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} = \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta
\]

Finally, integrate with respect to \( \theta \):
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{16} \int_{0}^{\pi/4} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta
\]

Using the substitution \( u = \tan\theta \), the integral of \( \sec^4\theta \) is evaluated as:
\[
\int \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \tan\theta + \frac{1}{3} \tan^3\theta \Big|_{0}^{\pi/4} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Thus, the integral simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\pi}{16} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{\pi}{12}
\]

So the integrand becomes ρ^3 sin^3φ / ρ^2 = ρ sin^3φ

Then, the integrand simplifies to ρ sin^3φ. The Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ, so the entire integral in spherical coordinates would be:

∫∫∫ (ρ sin^3φ) * ρ^2 sinφ dρ dφ dθ = ∫∫∫ ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, that seems manageable. But let&#x27;s check the limits of integration in spherical coordinates.

Original limits:

x from 0 to 1

y from 0 to x

z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

First, in spherical coordinates, the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) becomes ρ cosφ = sqrt(ρ^2 sin^2φ) = ρ sinφ. So:

ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ =&gt; cosφ = sinφ =&gt; tanφ = 1 =&gt; φ = π/4

So the upper limit for z is the cone φ = π/4. The lower limit for z is 0, which corresponds to φ = π/2 (the xy-plane), but wait, no. Wait, z goes from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). When z=0, that&#x27;s the xy-plane (φ=π/2). The upper limit is the cone φ=π/4. So in spherical coordinates, φ would go from π/4 to π/2. Wait, let me check:

In spherical coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is equivalent to ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ, so φ = π/4 as above. So for each (x, y), z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) up to the cone at φ=π/4. But actually, in spherical coordinates, varying z with fixed x and y corresponds to moving along a line of constant θ and φ? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. For a given (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). So in spherical terms, for a given radius in the xy-plane (r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)), z goes from 0 up to r. So in spherical coordinates, that would translate to ρ cosφ = z, and z goes up to r = ρ sinφ. So ρ cosφ &lt;= ρ sinφ =&gt; tanφ &gt;= 1 =&gt; φ &gt;= π/4, but since z is going from 0 to r, that would mean φ is between π/4 (when z=r) and π/2 (when z=0). Wait, but ρ is a variable here. Maybe I need to parametrize this.

Alternatively, maybe cylindrical coordinates would be better here. Let me try cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, z = z. The Jacobian is r.

The limits:

Original x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, so in cylindrical coordinates, θ goes from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, which is the line y=x in the first quadrant, so θ from 0 to π/4. Then r would go from 0 to something? Wait, x goes from 0 to 1, and y from 0 to x. Let me visualize this in the xy-plane. When x is from 0 to 1, and for each x, y is from 0 to x. So this is a triangular region in the xy-plane bounded by x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, which is the same as θ from 0 to π/4 and r from 0 to secθ, because x = r cosθ, so r = x / cosθ. When x=1, r = 1 / cosθ. So in cylindrical coordinates, the r limits would be from 0 to 1 / cosθ, but θ from 0 to π/4. Wait, let me verify:

If we fix θ, then in the original limits, y goes from 0 to x. In cylindrical coordinates, y = r sinθ and x = r cosθ. So y &lt;= x implies r sinθ &lt;= r cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4. That&#x27;s correct. So θ ranges from 0 to π/4. Then, for each θ, x goes from 0 to 1. Since x = r cosθ, then r cosθ goes from 0 to 1. So r goes from 0 to 1 / cosθ. Therefore, in cylindrical coordinates, the limits would be θ from 0 to π/4, r from 0 to 1 / cosθ, and z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = r.

So the z limits in cylindrical coordinates are from 0 to r. Then, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} / (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = (r^2)^{3/2} / (r^2 + z^2) = r^3 / (r^2 + z^2). Then, the integral becomes:

∫ (θ=0 to π/4) ∫ (r=0 to 1/cosθ) ∫ (z=0 to r) [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r dz dr dθ

Wait, the Jacobian is r, so the integrand becomes [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r = r^4 / (r^2 + z^2). So the integral in cylindrical coordinates is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

Hmm, is this easier than the original Cartesian integral? The original integral had a complicated integrand, but maybe in cylindrical coordinates, integrating with respect to z first might be manageable.

Alternatively, in spherical coordinates, let&#x27;s see. The integrand becomes ρ sin^3φ, and the Jacobian is ρ^2 sinφ, so overall ρ^3 sin^4φ. The limits in spherical coordinates would require figuring out ρ, φ, θ.

First, θ is from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, similar to cylindrical coordinates.

φ is from π/4 to π/2 because z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) to the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) (φ=π/4).

ρ is a bit trickier. For each direction (θ, φ), ρ starts at 0 and goes out to the maximum value within the region. But the original x goes up to 1. Let&#x27;s see. In spherical coordinates, x = ρ sinφ cosθ. The original x goes from 0 to 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;= 1. Therefore, ρ &lt;= 1 / (sinφ cosθ). But this seems complicated. However, the original limits also have y &lt;= x, which in spherical coordinates is ρ sinφ sinθ &lt;= ρ sinφ cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4, as before. So θ is from 0 to π/4. The upper limit for x is 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;=1. So ρ &lt;= 1/(sinφ cosθ). So in spherical coordinates, the integral would be:

∫_{θ=0}^{π/4} ∫_{φ=π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{ρ=0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ \, dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, integrating ρ^3 is straightforward, but the upper limit for ρ is 1/(sinφ cosθ), which when integrated would lead to terms with 1/(sinφ cosθ)^4, which might complicate things. Then integrating over φ and θ could be messy. So maybe spherical coordinates aren&#x27;t the best here.

Alternatively, in cylindrical coordinates, after integrating z first, maybe it&#x27;s manageable.

So let&#x27;s stick with cylindrical coordinates for now. Let me write out the integral again:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

So first, integrate with respect to z:

Let’s compute the inner integral ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz

Since r is treated as a constant with respect to z, this becomes r^4 ∫_{0}^{r} 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz

The integral of 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz is (1/r) arctan(z/r) ) + C

So evaluating from 0 to r:

(1/r) [ arctan(r/r) - arctan(0/r) ] = (1/r)[ arctan(1) - arctan(0) ] = (1/r)(π/4 - 0) = π/(4r)

Therefore, the inner integral becomes r^4 * π/(4r) = (π/4) r^3

So now, the integral reduces to:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} (π/4) r^3 dr dθ

= (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr ] dθ

Compute the integral over r:

∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr = [ (1/4) r^4 ] from 0 to 1/cosθ = (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So now:

I = (π/4) * (1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} (1/cosθ)^4 dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Hmm, integrating sec^4θ. The integral of sec^4θ dθ is a standard integral. Recall that ∫ sec^nθ dθ can be done using reduction formulas or using substitution. Let me recall:

∫ sec^4θ dθ = ∫ sec^2θ * sec^2θ dθ. Let’s use the identity sec^2θ = 1 + tan^2θ.

So:

= ∫ (1 + tan^2θ) sec^2θ dθ

Let u = tanθ, then du = sec^2θ dθ. Then the integral becomes:

∫ (1 + u^2) du = u + (1/3)u^3 + C = tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ + C

Therefore, the integral of sec^4θ dθ from 0 to π/4 is:

[ tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ ] from 0 to π/4

At π/4: tan(π/4) = 1, so 1 + (1/3)(1)^3 = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3

At 0: tan(0) = 0, so 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, the integral is 4/3 - 0 = 4/3

Therefore, I = (π/16) * (4/3) = π/12

So the final result is π/12.

Wait, let me verify once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make any mistakes.

Starting from the original integral:

Converted to cylindrical coordinates, ended up with:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz dr dθ

Integrated over z first:

Integral over z gives (π/4) r^3

Then integrated over r:

(1/4) r^4 evaluated from 0 to 1/cosθ gives (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So I becomes (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ = (π/16)*(4/3) = π/12

That seems correct. Let me check if converting to spherical coordinates would have been easier. Let me try that approach as a sanity check.

In spherical coordinates, the integral is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

First, integrate over ρ:

∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 dρ = [ (1/4) ρ^4 ] from 0 to 1/(sinφ cosθ) = (1/4)(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4

So the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} (1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 sin^4φ dφ dθ

Simplify the integrand:

(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 * sin^4φ = (1/sin^4φ cos^4θ) * sin^4φ = 1/(cos^4θ) * 1

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ ] / cos^4θ dθ

But wait, integrating over φ from π/4 to π/2:

∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ = π/2 - π/4 = π/4

Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

(1/4) * (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} 1/cos^4θ dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Which is exactly the same as in cylindrical coordinates! So indeed, the spherical coordinate approach also leads to the same integral, which evaluates to π/12. Therefore, both coordinate systems lead to the same result, but cylindrical coordinates perhaps made it a bit more straightforward because the limits for z were simpler.

So in conclusion, the integral simplifies to π/12 when converted to cylindrical coordinates (or spherical, but cylindrical was perhaps easier here). Therefore, the answer is π/12.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To convert the given triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical coordinates, we start by analyzing the region of integration and the integrand. The integral is:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

The region of integration is bounded by the cone \( z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the xy-plane. In cylindrical coordinates, this region is described by \( 0 \leq r \leq \frac{1}{\cos\theta} \), \( 0 \leq z \leq r \), and \( 0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{4} \).

The integrand in cylindrical coordinates becomes:
\[
\frac{(r^2)^{3/2}}{r^2 + z^2} = \frac{r^3}{r^2 + z^2}
\]

Including the Jacobian determinant \( r \), the integral transforms to:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( z \):
\[
\int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz = r^4 \left[ \frac{1}{r} \arctan\left(\frac{z}{r}\right) \right]_{0}^{r} = r^4 \left( \frac{\pi}{4r} \right) = \frac{\pi}{4} r^3
\]

Next, integrate with respect to \( r \):
\[
\int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \frac{\pi}{4} r^3 \, dr = \frac{\pi}{4} \left[ \frac{r^4}{4} \right]_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} = \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta
\]

Finally, integrate with respect to \( \theta \):
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{16} \int_{0}^{\pi/4} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta
\]

Using the substitution \( u = \tan\theta \), the integral of \( \sec^4\theta \) is evaluated as:
\[
\int \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \tan\theta + \frac{1}{3} \tan^3\theta \Big|_{0}^{\pi/4} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Thus, the integral simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\pi}{16} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{\pi}{12}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to convert this triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to either cylindrical or spherical coordinates. The integral is given as:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

First, I should probably understand the region of integration and see which coordinate system—cylindrical or spherical—would make things simpler. Let me start by analyzing the limits of integration.

Looking at the outermost integral, x goes from 0 to 1. Then, for each x, y goes from 0 to x. So in the xy-plane, this is a triangular region where y ranges from 0 to x, and x itself goes up to 1. Then, for each (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). That upper limit for z is interesting—it&#x27;s the equation of a cone, right? Because in Cartesian coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is a cone opening upwards with its vertex at the origin. So the region of integration is bounded below by the xy-plane (z=0) and above by this cone.

So, visualizing this, we have a region that&#x27;s a portion of a cone. Now, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} divided by (x^2 + y^2 + z^2). Let&#x27;s note that x^2 + y^2 is r^2 in cylindrical coordinates, and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is r^2 in spherical coordinates (but r in spherical is different from cylindrical). Hmm, so maybe spherical coordinates could help here because the denominator is the square of the distance from the origin, i.e., the radius in spherical coordinates.

But wait, the numerator is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} which is r^3 in cylindrical coordinates. The denominator is (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) which is r^2 in spherical coordinates (if we use r for spherical as the radial distance). So maybe converting to spherical coordinates would make the integrand simplify nicely. Let me check.

Alternatively, cylindrical coordinates might also work. Let&#x27;s consider both options.

First, let&#x27;s recall the conversions:

Cylindrical coordinates:
x = r cosθ
y = r sinθ
z = z
Jacobian determinant is r.

Spherical coordinates:
x = ρ sinφ cosθ
y = ρ sinφ sinθ
z = ρ cosφ
Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ.

Given the integrand involves both (x^2 + y^2) and (x^2 + y^2 + z^2), perhaps spherical coordinates would be better, since in spherical coordinates, x^2 + y^2 = ρ^2 sin^2φ and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = ρ^2. So substituting these into the integrand:

Numerator: (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} = (ρ^2 sin^2φ)^{3/2} = ρ^3 sin^3φ

Denominator: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = ρ^2

So the integrand becomes ρ^3 sin^3φ / ρ^2 = ρ sin^3φ

Then, the integrand simplifies to ρ sin^3φ. The Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ, so the entire integral in spherical coordinates would be:

∫∫∫ (ρ sin^3φ) * ρ^2 sinφ dρ dφ dθ = ∫∫∫ ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, that seems manageable. But let&#x27;s check the limits of integration in spherical coordinates.

Original limits:

x from 0 to 1

y from 0 to x

z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

First, in spherical coordinates, the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) becomes ρ cosφ = sqrt(ρ^2 sin^2φ) = ρ sinφ. So:

ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ =&gt; cosφ = sinφ =&gt; tanφ = 1 =&gt; φ = π/4

So the upper limit for z is the cone φ = π/4. The lower limit for z is 0, which corresponds to φ = π/2 (the xy-plane), but wait, no. Wait, z goes from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). When z=0, that&#x27;s the xy-plane (φ=π/2). The upper limit is the cone φ=π/4. So in spherical coordinates, φ would go from π/4 to π/2. Wait, let me check:

In spherical coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is equivalent to ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ, so φ = π/4 as above. So for each (x, y), z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) up to the cone at φ=π/4. But actually, in spherical coordinates, varying z with fixed x and y corresponds to moving along a line of constant θ and φ? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. For a given (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). So in spherical terms, for a given radius in the xy-plane (r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)), z goes from 0 up to r. So in spherical coordinates, that would translate to ρ cosφ = z, and z goes up to r = ρ sinφ. So ρ cosφ &lt;= ρ sinφ =&gt; tanφ &gt;= 1 =&gt; φ &gt;= π/4, but since z is going from 0 to r, that would mean φ is between π/4 (when z=r) and π/2 (when z=0). Wait, but ρ is a variable here. Maybe I need to parametrize this.

Alternatively, maybe cylindrical coordinates would be better here. Let me try cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, z = z. The Jacobian is r.

The limits:

Original x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, so in cylindrical coordinates, θ goes from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, which is the line y=x in the first quadrant, so θ from 0 to π/4. Then r would go from 0 to something? Wait, x goes from 0 to 1, and y from 0 to x. Let me visualize this in the xy-plane. When x is from 0 to 1, and for each x, y is from 0 to x. So this is a triangular region in the xy-plane bounded by x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, which is the same as θ from 0 to π/4 and r from 0 to secθ, because x = r cosθ, so r = x / cosθ. When x=1, r = 1 / cosθ. So in cylindrical coordinates, the r limits would be from 0 to 1 / cosθ, but θ from 0 to π/4. Wait, let me verify:

If we fix θ, then in the original limits, y goes from 0 to x. In cylindrical coordinates, y = r sinθ and x = r cosθ. So y &lt;= x implies r sinθ &lt;= r cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4. That&#x27;s correct. So θ ranges from 0 to π/4. Then, for each θ, x goes from 0 to 1. Since x = r cosθ, then r cosθ goes from 0 to 1. So r goes from 0 to 1 / cosθ. Therefore, in cylindrical coordinates, the limits would be θ from 0 to π/4, r from 0 to 1 / cosθ, and z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = r.

So the z limits in cylindrical coordinates are from 0 to r. Then, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} / (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = (r^2)^{3/2} / (r^2 + z^2) = r^3 / (r^2 + z^2). Then, the integral becomes:

∫ (θ=0 to π/4) ∫ (r=0 to 1/cosθ) ∫ (z=0 to r) [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r dz dr dθ

Wait, the Jacobian is r, so the integrand becomes [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r = r^4 / (r^2 + z^2). So the integral in cylindrical coordinates is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

Hmm, is this easier than the original Cartesian integral? The original integral had a complicated integrand, but maybe in cylindrical coordinates, integrating with respect to z first might be manageable.

Alternatively, in spherical coordinates, let&#x27;s see. The integrand becomes ρ sin^3φ, and the Jacobian is ρ^2 sinφ, so overall ρ^3 sin^4φ. The limits in spherical coordinates would require figuring out ρ, φ, θ.

First, θ is from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, similar to cylindrical coordinates.

φ is from π/4 to π/2 because z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) to the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) (φ=π/4).

ρ is a bit trickier. For each direction (θ, φ), ρ starts at 0 and goes out to the maximum value within the region. But the original x goes up to 1. Let&#x27;s see. In spherical coordinates, x = ρ sinφ cosθ. The original x goes from 0 to 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;= 1. Therefore, ρ &lt;= 1 / (sinφ cosθ). But this seems complicated. However, the original limits also have y &lt;= x, which in spherical coordinates is ρ sinφ sinθ &lt;= ρ sinφ cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4, as before. So θ is from 0 to π/4. The upper limit for x is 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;=1. So ρ &lt;= 1/(sinφ cosθ). So in spherical coordinates, the integral would be:

∫_{θ=0}^{π/4} ∫_{φ=π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{ρ=0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ \, dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, integrating ρ^3 is straightforward, but the upper limit for ρ is 1/(sinφ cosθ), which when integrated would lead to terms with 1/(sinφ cosθ)^4, which might complicate things. Then integrating over φ and θ could be messy. So maybe spherical coordinates aren&#x27;t the best here.

Alternatively, in cylindrical coordinates, after integrating z first, maybe it&#x27;s manageable.

So let&#x27;s stick with cylindrical coordinates for now. Let me write out the integral again:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

So first, integrate with respect to z:

Let’s compute the inner integral ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz

Since r is treated as a constant with respect to z, this becomes r^4 ∫_{0}^{r} 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz

The integral of 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz is (1/r) arctan(z/r) ) + C

So evaluating from 0 to r:

(1/r) [ arctan(r/r) - arctan(0/r) ] = (1/r)[ arctan(1) - arctan(0) ] = (1/r)(π/4 - 0) = π/(4r)

Therefore, the inner integral becomes r^4 * π/(4r) = (π/4) r^3

So now, the integral reduces to:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} (π/4) r^3 dr dθ

= (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr ] dθ

Compute the integral over r:

∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr = [ (1/4) r^4 ] from 0 to 1/cosθ = (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So now:

I = (π/4) * (1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} (1/cosθ)^4 dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Hmm, integrating sec^4θ. The integral of sec^4θ dθ is a standard integral. Recall that ∫ sec^nθ dθ can be done using reduction formulas or using substitution. Let me recall:

∫ sec^4θ dθ = ∫ sec^2θ * sec^2θ dθ. Let’s use the identity sec^2θ = 1 + tan^2θ.

So:

= ∫ (1 + tan^2θ) sec^2θ dθ

Let u = tanθ, then du = sec^2θ dθ. Then the integral becomes:

∫ (1 + u^2) du = u + (1/3)u^3 + C = tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ + C

Therefore, the integral of sec^4θ dθ from 0 to π/4 is:

[ tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ ] from 0 to π/4

At π/4: tan(π/4) = 1, so 1 + (1/3)(1)^3 = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3

At 0: tan(0) = 0, so 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, the integral is 4/3 - 0 = 4/3

Therefore, I = (π/16) * (4/3) = π/12

So the final result is π/12.

Wait, let me verify once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make any mistakes.

Starting from the original integral:

Converted to cylindrical coordinates, ended up with:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz dr dθ

Integrated over z first:

Integral over z gives (π/4) r^3

Then integrated over r:

(1/4) r^4 evaluated from 0 to 1/cosθ gives (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So I becomes (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ = (π/16)*(4/3) = π/12

That seems correct. Let me check if converting to spherical coordinates would have been easier. Let me try that approach as a sanity check.

In spherical coordinates, the integral is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

First, integrate over ρ:

∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 dρ = [ (1/4) ρ^4 ] from 0 to 1/(sinφ cosθ) = (1/4)(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4

So the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} (1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 sin^4φ dφ dθ

Simplify the integrand:

(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 * sin^4φ = (1/sin^4φ cos^4θ) * sin^4φ = 1/(cos^4θ) * 1

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ ] / cos^4θ dθ

But wait, integrating over φ from π/4 to π/2:

∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ = π/2 - π/4 = π/4

Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

(1/4) * (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} 1/cos^4θ dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Which is exactly the same as in cylindrical coordinates! So indeed, the spherical coordinate approach also leads to the same integral, which evaluates to π/12. Therefore, both coordinate systems lead to the same result, but cylindrical coordinates perhaps made it a bit more straightforward because the limits for z were simpler.

So in conclusion, the integral simplifies to π/12 when converted to cylindrical coordinates (or spherical, but cylindrical was perhaps easier here). Therefore, the answer is π/12.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To convert the given triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical coordinates, we start by analyzing the region of integration and the integrand. The integral is:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

The region of integration is bounded by the cone \( z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the xy-plane. In cylindrical coordinates, this region is described by \( 0 \leq r \leq \frac{1}{\cos\theta} \), \( 0 \leq z \leq r \), and \( 0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{4} \).

The integrand in cylindrical coordinates becomes:
\[
\frac{(r^2)^{3/2}}{r^2 + z^2} = \frac{r^3}{r^2 + z^2}
\]

Including the Jacobian determinant \( r \), the integral transforms to:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( z \):
\[
\int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz = r^4 \left[ \frac{1}{r} \arctan\left(\frac{z}{r}\right) \right]_{0}^{r} = r^4 \left( \frac{\pi}{4r} \right) = \frac{\pi}{4} r^3
\]

Next, integrate with respect to \( r \):
\[
\int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \frac{\pi}{4} r^3 \, dr = \frac{\pi}{4} \left[ \frac{r^4}{4} \right]_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} = \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta
\]

Finally, integrate with respect to \( \theta \):
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{16} \int_{0}^{\pi/4} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta
\]

Using the substitution \( u = \tan\theta \), the integral of \( \sec^4\theta \) is evaluated as:
\[
\int \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \tan\theta + \frac{1}{3} \tan^3\theta \Big|_{0}^{\pi/4} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Thus, the integral simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\pi}{16} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{\pi}{12}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to convert this triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to either cylindrical or spherical coordinates. The integral is given as:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

First, I should probably understand the region of integration and see which coordinate system—cylindrical or spherical—would make things simpler. Let me start by analyzing the limits of integration.

Looking at the outermost integral, x goes from 0 to 1. Then, for each x, y goes from 0 to x. So in the xy-plane, this is a triangular region where y ranges from 0 to x, and x itself goes up to 1. Then, for each (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). That upper limit for z is interesting—it&#x27;s the equation of a cone, right? Because in Cartesian coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is a cone opening upwards with its vertex at the origin. So the region of integration is bounded below by the xy-plane (z=0) and above by this cone.

So, visualizing this, we have a region that&#x27;s a portion of a cone. Now, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} divided by (x^2 + y^2 + z^2). Let&#x27;s note that x^2 + y^2 is r^2 in cylindrical coordinates, and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is r^2 in spherical coordinates (but r in spherical is different from cylindrical). Hmm, so maybe spherical coordinates could help here because the denominator is the square of the distance from the origin, i.e., the radius in spherical coordinates.

But wait, the numerator is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} which is r^3 in cylindrical coordinates. The denominator is (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) which is r^2 in spherical coordinates (if we use r for spherical as the radial distance). So maybe converting to spherical coordinates would make the integrand simplify nicely. Let me check.

Alternatively, cylindrical coordinates might also work. Let&#x27;s consider both options.

First, let&#x27;s recall the conversions:

Cylindrical coordinates:
x = r cosθ
y = r sinθ
z = z
Jacobian determinant is r.

Spherical coordinates:
x = ρ sinφ cosθ
y = ρ sinφ sinθ
z = ρ cosφ
Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ.

Given the integrand involves both (x^2 + y^2) and (x^2 + y^2 + z^2), perhaps spherical coordinates would be better, since in spherical coordinates, x^2 + y^2 = ρ^2 sin^2φ and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = ρ^2. So substituting these into the integrand:

Numerator: (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} = (ρ^2 sin^2φ)^{3/2} = ρ^3 sin^3φ

Denominator: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = ρ^2

So the integrand becomes ρ^3 sin^3φ / ρ^2 = ρ sin^3φ

Then, the integrand simplifies to ρ sin^3φ. The Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ, so the entire integral in spherical coordinates would be:

∫∫∫ (ρ sin^3φ) * ρ^2 sinφ dρ dφ dθ = ∫∫∫ ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, that seems manageable. But let&#x27;s check the limits of integration in spherical coordinates.

Original limits:

x from 0 to 1

y from 0 to x

z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

First, in spherical coordinates, the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) becomes ρ cosφ = sqrt(ρ^2 sin^2φ) = ρ sinφ. So:

ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ =&gt; cosφ = sinφ =&gt; tanφ = 1 =&gt; φ = π/4

So the upper limit for z is the cone φ = π/4. The lower limit for z is 0, which corresponds to φ = π/2 (the xy-plane), but wait, no. Wait, z goes from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). When z=0, that&#x27;s the xy-plane (φ=π/2). The upper limit is the cone φ=π/4. So in spherical coordinates, φ would go from π/4 to π/2. Wait, let me check:

In spherical coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is equivalent to ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ, so φ = π/4 as above. So for each (x, y), z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) up to the cone at φ=π/4. But actually, in spherical coordinates, varying z with fixed x and y corresponds to moving along a line of constant θ and φ? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. For a given (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). So in spherical terms, for a given radius in the xy-plane (r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)), z goes from 0 up to r. So in spherical coordinates, that would translate to ρ cosφ = z, and z goes up to r = ρ sinφ. So ρ cosφ &lt;= ρ sinφ =&gt; tanφ &gt;= 1 =&gt; φ &gt;= π/4, but since z is going from 0 to r, that would mean φ is between π/4 (when z=r) and π/2 (when z=0). Wait, but ρ is a variable here. Maybe I need to parametrize this.

Alternatively, maybe cylindrical coordinates would be better here. Let me try cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, z = z. The Jacobian is r.

The limits:

Original x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, so in cylindrical coordinates, θ goes from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, which is the line y=x in the first quadrant, so θ from 0 to π/4. Then r would go from 0 to something? Wait, x goes from 0 to 1, and y from 0 to x. Let me visualize this in the xy-plane. When x is from 0 to 1, and for each x, y is from 0 to x. So this is a triangular region in the xy-plane bounded by x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, which is the same as θ from 0 to π/4 and r from 0 to secθ, because x = r cosθ, so r = x / cosθ. When x=1, r = 1 / cosθ. So in cylindrical coordinates, the r limits would be from 0 to 1 / cosθ, but θ from 0 to π/4. Wait, let me verify:

If we fix θ, then in the original limits, y goes from 0 to x. In cylindrical coordinates, y = r sinθ and x = r cosθ. So y &lt;= x implies r sinθ &lt;= r cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4. That&#x27;s correct. So θ ranges from 0 to π/4. Then, for each θ, x goes from 0 to 1. Since x = r cosθ, then r cosθ goes from 0 to 1. So r goes from 0 to 1 / cosθ. Therefore, in cylindrical coordinates, the limits would be θ from 0 to π/4, r from 0 to 1 / cosθ, and z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = r.

So the z limits in cylindrical coordinates are from 0 to r. Then, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} / (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = (r^2)^{3/2} / (r^2 + z^2) = r^3 / (r^2 + z^2). Then, the integral becomes:

∫ (θ=0 to π/4) ∫ (r=0 to 1/cosθ) ∫ (z=0 to r) [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r dz dr dθ

Wait, the Jacobian is r, so the integrand becomes [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r = r^4 / (r^2 + z^2). So the integral in cylindrical coordinates is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

Hmm, is this easier than the original Cartesian integral? The original integral had a complicated integrand, but maybe in cylindrical coordinates, integrating with respect to z first might be manageable.

Alternatively, in spherical coordinates, let&#x27;s see. The integrand becomes ρ sin^3φ, and the Jacobian is ρ^2 sinφ, so overall ρ^3 sin^4φ. The limits in spherical coordinates would require figuring out ρ, φ, θ.

First, θ is from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, similar to cylindrical coordinates.

φ is from π/4 to π/2 because z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) to the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) (φ=π/4).

ρ is a bit trickier. For each direction (θ, φ), ρ starts at 0 and goes out to the maximum value within the region. But the original x goes up to 1. Let&#x27;s see. In spherical coordinates, x = ρ sinφ cosθ. The original x goes from 0 to 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;= 1. Therefore, ρ &lt;= 1 / (sinφ cosθ). But this seems complicated. However, the original limits also have y &lt;= x, which in spherical coordinates is ρ sinφ sinθ &lt;= ρ sinφ cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4, as before. So θ is from 0 to π/4. The upper limit for x is 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;=1. So ρ &lt;= 1/(sinφ cosθ). So in spherical coordinates, the integral would be:

∫_{θ=0}^{π/4} ∫_{φ=π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{ρ=0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ \, dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, integrating ρ^3 is straightforward, but the upper limit for ρ is 1/(sinφ cosθ), which when integrated would lead to terms with 1/(sinφ cosθ)^4, which might complicate things. Then integrating over φ and θ could be messy. So maybe spherical coordinates aren&#x27;t the best here.

Alternatively, in cylindrical coordinates, after integrating z first, maybe it&#x27;s manageable.

So let&#x27;s stick with cylindrical coordinates for now. Let me write out the integral again:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

So first, integrate with respect to z:

Let’s compute the inner integral ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz

Since r is treated as a constant with respect to z, this becomes r^4 ∫_{0}^{r} 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz

The integral of 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz is (1/r) arctan(z/r) ) + C

So evaluating from 0 to r:

(1/r) [ arctan(r/r) - arctan(0/r) ] = (1/r)[ arctan(1) - arctan(0) ] = (1/r)(π/4 - 0) = π/(4r)

Therefore, the inner integral becomes r^4 * π/(4r) = (π/4) r^3

So now, the integral reduces to:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} (π/4) r^3 dr dθ

= (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr ] dθ

Compute the integral over r:

∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr = [ (1/4) r^4 ] from 0 to 1/cosθ = (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So now:

I = (π/4) * (1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} (1/cosθ)^4 dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Hmm, integrating sec^4θ. The integral of sec^4θ dθ is a standard integral. Recall that ∫ sec^nθ dθ can be done using reduction formulas or using substitution. Let me recall:

∫ sec^4θ dθ = ∫ sec^2θ * sec^2θ dθ. Let’s use the identity sec^2θ = 1 + tan^2θ.

So:

= ∫ (1 + tan^2θ) sec^2θ dθ

Let u = tanθ, then du = sec^2θ dθ. Then the integral becomes:

∫ (1 + u^2) du = u + (1/3)u^3 + C = tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ + C

Therefore, the integral of sec^4θ dθ from 0 to π/4 is:

[ tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ ] from 0 to π/4

At π/4: tan(π/4) = 1, so 1 + (1/3)(1)^3 = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3

At 0: tan(0) = 0, so 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, the integral is 4/3 - 0 = 4/3

Therefore, I = (π/16) * (4/3) = π/12

So the final result is π/12.

Wait, let me verify once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make any mistakes.

Starting from the original integral:

Converted to cylindrical coordinates, ended up with:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz dr dθ

Integrated over z first:

Integral over z gives (π/4) r^3

Then integrated over r:

(1/4) r^4 evaluated from 0 to 1/cosθ gives (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So I becomes (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ = (π/16)*(4/3) = π/12

That seems correct. Let me check if converting to spherical coordinates would have been easier. Let me try that approach as a sanity check.

In spherical coordinates, the integral is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

First, integrate over ρ:

∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 dρ = [ (1/4) ρ^4 ] from 0 to 1/(sinφ cosθ) = (1/4)(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4

So the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} (1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 sin^4φ dφ dθ

Simplify the integrand:

(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 * sin^4φ = (1/sin^4φ cos^4θ) * sin^4φ = 1/(cos^4θ) * 1

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ ] / cos^4θ dθ

But wait, integrating over φ from π/4 to π/2:

∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ = π/2 - π/4 = π/4

Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

(1/4) * (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} 1/cos^4θ dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Which is exactly the same as in cylindrical coordinates! So indeed, the spherical coordinate approach also leads to the same integral, which evaluates to π/12. Therefore, both coordinate systems lead to the same result, but cylindrical coordinates perhaps made it a bit more straightforward because the limits for z were simpler.

So in conclusion, the integral simplifies to π/12 when converted to cylindrical coordinates (or spherical, but cylindrical was perhaps easier here). Therefore, the answer is π/12.

To convert the given triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical coordinates, we start by analyzing the region of integration and the integrand. The integral is:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

The region of integration is bounded by the cone \( z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the xy-plane. In cylindrical coordinates, this region is described by \( 0 \leq r \leq \frac{1}{\cos\theta} \), \( 0 \leq z \leq r \), and \( 0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{4} \).

The integrand in cylindrical coordinates becomes:
\[
\frac{(r^2)^{3/2}}{r^2 + z^2} = \frac{r^3}{r^2 + z^2}
\]

Including the Jacobian determinant \( r \), the integral transforms to:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( z \):
\[
\int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz = r^4 \left[ \frac{1}{r} \arctan\left(\frac{z}{r}\right) \right]_{0}^{r} = r^4 \left( \frac{\pi}{4r} \right) = \frac{\pi}{4} r^3
\]

Next, integrate with respect to \( r \):
\[
\int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \frac{\pi}{4} r^3 \, dr = \frac{\pi}{4} \left[ \frac{r^4}{4} \right]_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} = \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta
\]

Finally, integrate with respect to \( \theta \):
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{16} \int_{0}^{\pi/4} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta
\]

Using the substitution \( u = \tan\theta \), the integral of \( \sec^4\theta \) is evaluated as:
\[
\int \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \tan\theta + \frac{1}{3} \tan^3\theta \Big|_{0}^{\pi/4} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Thus, the integral simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\pi}{16} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{\pi}{12}
\]

The final answer is:
\[

So the integrand becomes ρ^3 sin^3φ / ρ^2 = ρ sin^3φ

Then, the integrand simplifies to ρ sin^3φ. The Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ, so the entire integral in spherical coordinates would be:

∫∫∫ (ρ sin^3φ) * ρ^2 sinφ dρ dφ dθ = ∫∫∫ ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, that seems manageable. But let&#x27;s check the limits of integration in spherical coordinates.

Original limits:

x from 0 to 1

y from 0 to x

z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

First, in spherical coordinates, the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) becomes ρ cosφ = sqrt(ρ^2 sin^2φ) = ρ sinφ. So:

ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ =&gt; cosφ = sinφ =&gt; tanφ = 1 =&gt; φ = π/4

So the upper limit for z is the cone φ = π/4. The lower limit for z is 0, which corresponds to φ = π/2 (the xy-plane), but wait, no. Wait, z goes from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). When z=0, that&#x27;s the xy-plane (φ=π/2). The upper limit is the cone φ=π/4. So in spherical coordinates, φ would go from π/4 to π/2. Wait, let me check:

In spherical coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is equivalent to ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ, so φ = π/4 as above. So for each (x, y), z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) up to the cone at φ=π/4. But actually, in spherical coordinates, varying z with fixed x and y corresponds to moving along a line of constant θ and φ? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. For a given (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). So in spherical terms, for a given radius in the xy-plane (r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)), z goes from 0 up to r. So in spherical coordinates, that would translate to ρ cosφ = z, and z goes up to r = ρ sinφ. So ρ cosφ &lt;= ρ sinφ =&gt; tanφ &gt;= 1 =&gt; φ &gt;= π/4, but since z is going from 0 to r, that would mean φ is between π/4 (when z=r) and π/2 (when z=0). Wait, but ρ is a variable here. Maybe I need to parametrize this.

Alternatively, maybe cylindrical coordinates would be better here. Let me try cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, z = z. The Jacobian is r.

The limits:

Original x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, so in cylindrical coordinates, θ goes from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, which is the line y=x in the first quadrant, so θ from 0 to π/4. Then r would go from 0 to something? Wait, x goes from 0 to 1, and y from 0 to x. Let me visualize this in the xy-plane. When x is from 0 to 1, and for each x, y is from 0 to x. So this is a triangular region in the xy-plane bounded by x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, which is the same as θ from 0 to π/4 and r from 0 to secθ, because x = r cosθ, so r = x / cosθ. When x=1, r = 1 / cosθ. So in cylindrical coordinates, the r limits would be from 0 to 1 / cosθ, but θ from 0 to π/4. Wait, let me verify:

If we fix θ, then in the original limits, y goes from 0 to x. In cylindrical coordinates, y = r sinθ and x = r cosθ. So y &lt;= x implies r sinθ &lt;= r cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4. That&#x27;s correct. So θ ranges from 0 to π/4. Then, for each θ, x goes from 0 to 1. Since x = r cosθ, then r cosθ goes from 0 to 1. So r goes from 0 to 1 / cosθ. Therefore, in cylindrical coordinates, the limits would be θ from 0 to π/4, r from 0 to 1 / cosθ, and z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = r.

So the z limits in cylindrical coordinates are from 0 to r. Then, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} / (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = (r^2)^{3/2} / (r^2 + z^2) = r^3 / (r^2 + z^2). Then, the integral becomes:

∫ (θ=0 to π/4) ∫ (r=0 to 1/cosθ) ∫ (z=0 to r) [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r dz dr dθ

Wait, the Jacobian is r, so the integrand becomes [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r = r^4 / (r^2 + z^2). So the integral in cylindrical coordinates is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

Hmm, is this easier than the original Cartesian integral? The original integral had a complicated integrand, but maybe in cylindrical coordinates, integrating with respect to z first might be manageable.

Alternatively, in spherical coordinates, let&#x27;s see. The integrand becomes ρ sin^3φ, and the Jacobian is ρ^2 sinφ, so overall ρ^3 sin^4φ. The limits in spherical coordinates would require figuring out ρ, φ, θ.

First, θ is from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, similar to cylindrical coordinates.

φ is from π/4 to π/2 because z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) to the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) (φ=π/4).

ρ is a bit trickier. For each direction (θ, φ), ρ starts at 0 and goes out to the maximum value within the region. But the original x goes up to 1. Let&#x27;s see. In spherical coordinates, x = ρ sinφ cosθ. The original x goes from 0 to 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;= 1. Therefore, ρ &lt;= 1 / (sinφ cosθ). But this seems complicated. However, the original limits also have y &lt;= x, which in spherical coordinates is ρ sinφ sinθ &lt;= ρ sinφ cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4, as before. So θ is from 0 to π/4. The upper limit for x is 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;=1. So ρ &lt;= 1/(sinφ cosθ). So in spherical coordinates, the integral would be:

∫_{θ=0}^{π/4} ∫_{φ=π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{ρ=0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ \, dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, integrating ρ^3 is straightforward, but the upper limit for ρ is 1/(sinφ cosθ), which when integrated would lead to terms with 1/(sinφ cosθ)^4, which might complicate things. Then integrating over φ and θ could be messy. So maybe spherical coordinates aren&#x27;t the best here.

Alternatively, in cylindrical coordinates, after integrating z first, maybe it&#x27;s manageable.

So let&#x27;s stick with cylindrical coordinates for now. Let me write out the integral again:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

So first, integrate with respect to z:

Let’s compute the inner integral ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz

Since r is treated as a constant with respect to z, this becomes r^4 ∫_{0}^{r} 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz

The integral of 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz is (1/r) arctan(z/r) ) + C

So evaluating from 0 to r:

(1/r) [ arctan(r/r) - arctan(0/r) ] = (1/r)[ arctan(1) - arctan(0) ] = (1/r)(π/4 - 0) = π/(4r)

Therefore, the inner integral becomes r^4 * π/(4r) = (π/4) r^3

So now, the integral reduces to:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} (π/4) r^3 dr dθ

= (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr ] dθ

Compute the integral over r:

∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr = [ (1/4) r^4 ] from 0 to 1/cosθ = (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So now:

I = (π/4) * (1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} (1/cosθ)^4 dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Hmm, integrating sec^4θ. The integral of sec^4θ dθ is a standard integral. Recall that ∫ sec^nθ dθ can be done using reduction formulas or using substitution. Let me recall:

∫ sec^4θ dθ = ∫ sec^2θ * sec^2θ dθ. Let’s use the identity sec^2θ = 1 + tan^2θ.

So:

= ∫ (1 + tan^2θ) sec^2θ dθ

Let u = tanθ, then du = sec^2θ dθ. Then the integral becomes:

∫ (1 + u^2) du = u + (1/3)u^3 + C = tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ + C

Therefore, the integral of sec^4θ dθ from 0 to π/4 is:

[ tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ ] from 0 to π/4

At π/4: tan(π/4) = 1, so 1 + (1/3)(1)^3 = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3

At 0: tan(0) = 0, so 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, the integral is 4/3 - 0 = 4/3

Therefore, I = (π/16) * (4/3) = π/12

So the final result is π/12.

Wait, let me verify once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make any mistakes.

Starting from the original integral:

Converted to cylindrical coordinates, ended up with:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz dr dθ

Integrated over z first:

Integral over z gives (π/4) r^3

Then integrated over r:

(1/4) r^4 evaluated from 0 to 1/cosθ gives (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So I becomes (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ = (π/16)*(4/3) = π/12

That seems correct. Let me check if converting to spherical coordinates would have been easier. Let me try that approach as a sanity check.

In spherical coordinates, the integral is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

First, integrate over ρ:

∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 dρ = [ (1/4) ρ^4 ] from 0 to 1/(sinφ cosθ) = (1/4)(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4

So the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} (1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 sin^4φ dφ dθ

Simplify the integrand:

(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 * sin^4φ = (1/sin^4φ cos^4θ) * sin^4φ = 1/(cos^4θ) * 1

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ ] / cos^4θ dθ

But wait, integrating over φ from π/4 to π/2:

∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ = π/2 - π/4 = π/4

Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

(1/4) * (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} 1/cos^4θ dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Which is exactly the same as in cylindrical coordinates! So indeed, the spherical coordinate approach also leads to the same integral, which evaluates to π/12. Therefore, both coordinate systems lead to the same result, but cylindrical coordinates perhaps made it a bit more straightforward because the limits for z were simpler.

So in conclusion, the integral simplifies to π/12 when converted to cylindrical coordinates (or spherical, but cylindrical was perhaps easier here). Therefore, the answer is π/12.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To convert the given triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical coordinates, we start by analyzing the region of integration and the integrand. The integral is:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

The region of integration is bounded by the cone \( z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the xy-plane. In cylindrical coordinates, this region is described by \( 0 \leq r \leq \frac{1}{\cos\theta} \), \( 0 \leq z \leq r \), and \( 0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{4} \).

The integrand in cylindrical coordinates becomes:
\[
\frac{(r^2)^{3/2}}{r^2 + z^2} = \frac{r^3}{r^2 + z^2}
\]

Including the Jacobian determinant \( r \), the integral transforms to:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( z \):
\[
\int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz = r^4 \left[ \frac{1}{r} \arctan\left(\frac{z}{r}\right) \right]_{0}^{r} = r^4 \left( \frac{\pi}{4r} \right) = \frac{\pi}{4} r^3
\]

Next, integrate with respect to \( r \):
\[
\int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \frac{\pi}{4} r^3 \, dr = \frac{\pi}{4} \left[ \frac{r^4}{4} \right]_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} = \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta
\]

Finally, integrate with respect to \( \theta \):
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{16} \int_{0}^{\pi/4} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta
\]

Using the substitution \( u = \tan\theta \), the integral of \( \sec^4\theta \) is evaluated as:
\[
\int \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \tan\theta + \frac{1}{3} \tan^3\theta \Big|_{0}^{\pi/4} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Thus, the integral simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\pi}{16} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{\pi}{12}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to convert this triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to either cylindrical or spherical coordinates. The integral is given as:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

First, I should probably understand the region of integration and see which coordinate system—cylindrical or spherical—would make things simpler. Let me start by analyzing the limits of integration.

Looking at the outermost integral, x goes from 0 to 1. Then, for each x, y goes from 0 to x. So in the xy-plane, this is a triangular region where y ranges from 0 to x, and x itself goes up to 1. Then, for each (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). That upper limit for z is interesting—it&#x27;s the equation of a cone, right? Because in Cartesian coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is a cone opening upwards with its vertex at the origin. So the region of integration is bounded below by the xy-plane (z=0) and above by this cone.

So, visualizing this, we have a region that&#x27;s a portion of a cone. Now, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} divided by (x^2 + y^2 + z^2). Let&#x27;s note that x^2 + y^2 is r^2 in cylindrical coordinates, and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is r^2 in spherical coordinates (but r in spherical is different from cylindrical). Hmm, so maybe spherical coordinates could help here because the denominator is the square of the distance from the origin, i.e., the radius in spherical coordinates.

But wait, the numerator is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} which is r^3 in cylindrical coordinates. The denominator is (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) which is r^2 in spherical coordinates (if we use r for spherical as the radial distance). So maybe converting to spherical coordinates would make the integrand simplify nicely. Let me check.

Alternatively, cylindrical coordinates might also work. Let&#x27;s consider both options.

First, let&#x27;s recall the conversions:

Cylindrical coordinates:
x = r cosθ
y = r sinθ
z = z
Jacobian determinant is r.

Spherical coordinates:
x = ρ sinφ cosθ
y = ρ sinφ sinθ
z = ρ cosφ
Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ.

Given the integrand involves both (x^2 + y^2) and (x^2 + y^2 + z^2), perhaps spherical coordinates would be better, since in spherical coordinates, x^2 + y^2 = ρ^2 sin^2φ and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = ρ^2. So substituting these into the integrand:

Numerator: (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} = (ρ^2 sin^2φ)^{3/2} = ρ^3 sin^3φ

Denominator: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = ρ^2

So the integrand becomes ρ^3 sin^3φ / ρ^2 = ρ sin^3φ

Then, the integrand simplifies to ρ sin^3φ. The Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ, so the entire integral in spherical coordinates would be:

∫∫∫ (ρ sin^3φ) * ρ^2 sinφ dρ dφ dθ = ∫∫∫ ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, that seems manageable. But let&#x27;s check the limits of integration in spherical coordinates.

Original limits:

x from 0 to 1

y from 0 to x

z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

First, in spherical coordinates, the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) becomes ρ cosφ = sqrt(ρ^2 sin^2φ) = ρ sinφ. So:

ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ =&gt; cosφ = sinφ =&gt; tanφ = 1 =&gt; φ = π/4

So the upper limit for z is the cone φ = π/4. The lower limit for z is 0, which corresponds to φ = π/2 (the xy-plane), but wait, no. Wait, z goes from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). When z=0, that&#x27;s the xy-plane (φ=π/2). The upper limit is the cone φ=π/4. So in spherical coordinates, φ would go from π/4 to π/2. Wait, let me check:

In spherical coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is equivalent to ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ, so φ = π/4 as above. So for each (x, y), z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) up to the cone at φ=π/4. But actually, in spherical coordinates, varying z with fixed x and y corresponds to moving along a line of constant θ and φ? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. For a given (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). So in spherical terms, for a given radius in the xy-plane (r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)), z goes from 0 up to r. So in spherical coordinates, that would translate to ρ cosφ = z, and z goes up to r = ρ sinφ. So ρ cosφ &lt;= ρ sinφ =&gt; tanφ &gt;= 1 =&gt; φ &gt;= π/4, but since z is going from 0 to r, that would mean φ is between π/4 (when z=r) and π/2 (when z=0). Wait, but ρ is a variable here. Maybe I need to parametrize this.

Alternatively, maybe cylindrical coordinates would be better here. Let me try cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, z = z. The Jacobian is r.

The limits:

Original x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, so in cylindrical coordinates, θ goes from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, which is the line y=x in the first quadrant, so θ from 0 to π/4. Then r would go from 0 to something? Wait, x goes from 0 to 1, and y from 0 to x. Let me visualize this in the xy-plane. When x is from 0 to 1, and for each x, y is from 0 to x. So this is a triangular region in the xy-plane bounded by x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, which is the same as θ from 0 to π/4 and r from 0 to secθ, because x = r cosθ, so r = x / cosθ. When x=1, r = 1 / cosθ. So in cylindrical coordinates, the r limits would be from 0 to 1 / cosθ, but θ from 0 to π/4. Wait, let me verify:

If we fix θ, then in the original limits, y goes from 0 to x. In cylindrical coordinates, y = r sinθ and x = r cosθ. So y &lt;= x implies r sinθ &lt;= r cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4. That&#x27;s correct. So θ ranges from 0 to π/4. Then, for each θ, x goes from 0 to 1. Since x = r cosθ, then r cosθ goes from 0 to 1. So r goes from 0 to 1 / cosθ. Therefore, in cylindrical coordinates, the limits would be θ from 0 to π/4, r from 0 to 1 / cosθ, and z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = r.

So the z limits in cylindrical coordinates are from 0 to r. Then, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} / (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = (r^2)^{3/2} / (r^2 + z^2) = r^3 / (r^2 + z^2). Then, the integral becomes:

∫ (θ=0 to π/4) ∫ (r=0 to 1/cosθ) ∫ (z=0 to r) [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r dz dr dθ

Wait, the Jacobian is r, so the integrand becomes [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r = r^4 / (r^2 + z^2). So the integral in cylindrical coordinates is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

Hmm, is this easier than the original Cartesian integral? The original integral had a complicated integrand, but maybe in cylindrical coordinates, integrating with respect to z first might be manageable.

Alternatively, in spherical coordinates, let&#x27;s see. The integrand becomes ρ sin^3φ, and the Jacobian is ρ^2 sinφ, so overall ρ^3 sin^4φ. The limits in spherical coordinates would require figuring out ρ, φ, θ.

First, θ is from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, similar to cylindrical coordinates.

φ is from π/4 to π/2 because z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) to the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) (φ=π/4).

ρ is a bit trickier. For each direction (θ, φ), ρ starts at 0 and goes out to the maximum value within the region. But the original x goes up to 1. Let&#x27;s see. In spherical coordinates, x = ρ sinφ cosθ. The original x goes from 0 to 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;= 1. Therefore, ρ &lt;= 1 / (sinφ cosθ). But this seems complicated. However, the original limits also have y &lt;= x, which in spherical coordinates is ρ sinφ sinθ &lt;= ρ sinφ cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4, as before. So θ is from 0 to π/4. The upper limit for x is 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;=1. So ρ &lt;= 1/(sinφ cosθ). So in spherical coordinates, the integral would be:

∫_{θ=0}^{π/4} ∫_{φ=π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{ρ=0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ \, dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, integrating ρ^3 is straightforward, but the upper limit for ρ is 1/(sinφ cosθ), which when integrated would lead to terms with 1/(sinφ cosθ)^4, which might complicate things. Then integrating over φ and θ could be messy. So maybe spherical coordinates aren&#x27;t the best here.

Alternatively, in cylindrical coordinates, after integrating z first, maybe it&#x27;s manageable.

So let&#x27;s stick with cylindrical coordinates for now. Let me write out the integral again:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

So first, integrate with respect to z:

Let’s compute the inner integral ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz

Since r is treated as a constant with respect to z, this becomes r^4 ∫_{0}^{r} 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz

The integral of 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz is (1/r) arctan(z/r) ) + C

So evaluating from 0 to r:

(1/r) [ arctan(r/r) - arctan(0/r) ] = (1/r)[ arctan(1) - arctan(0) ] = (1/r)(π/4 - 0) = π/(4r)

Therefore, the inner integral becomes r^4 * π/(4r) = (π/4) r^3

So now, the integral reduces to:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} (π/4) r^3 dr dθ

= (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr ] dθ

Compute the integral over r:

∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr = [ (1/4) r^4 ] from 0 to 1/cosθ = (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So now:

I = (π/4) * (1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} (1/cosθ)^4 dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Hmm, integrating sec^4θ. The integral of sec^4θ dθ is a standard integral. Recall that ∫ sec^nθ dθ can be done using reduction formulas or using substitution. Let me recall:

∫ sec^4θ dθ = ∫ sec^2θ * sec^2θ dθ. Let’s use the identity sec^2θ = 1 + tan^2θ.

So:

= ∫ (1 + tan^2θ) sec^2θ dθ

Let u = tanθ, then du = sec^2θ dθ. Then the integral becomes:

∫ (1 + u^2) du = u + (1/3)u^3 + C = tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ + C

Therefore, the integral of sec^4θ dθ from 0 to π/4 is:

[ tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ ] from 0 to π/4

At π/4: tan(π/4) = 1, so 1 + (1/3)(1)^3 = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3

At 0: tan(0) = 0, so 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, the integral is 4/3 - 0 = 4/3

Therefore, I = (π/16) * (4/3) = π/12

So the final result is π/12.

Wait, let me verify once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make any mistakes.

Starting from the original integral:

Converted to cylindrical coordinates, ended up with:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz dr dθ

Integrated over z first:

Integral over z gives (π/4) r^3

Then integrated over r:

(1/4) r^4 evaluated from 0 to 1/cosθ gives (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So I becomes (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ = (π/16)*(4/3) = π/12

That seems correct. Let me check if converting to spherical coordinates would have been easier. Let me try that approach as a sanity check.

In spherical coordinates, the integral is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

First, integrate over ρ:

∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 dρ = [ (1/4) ρ^4 ] from 0 to 1/(sinφ cosθ) = (1/4)(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4

So the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} (1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 sin^4φ dφ dθ

Simplify the integrand:

(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 * sin^4φ = (1/sin^4φ cos^4θ) * sin^4φ = 1/(cos^4θ) * 1

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ ] / cos^4θ dθ

But wait, integrating over φ from π/4 to π/2:

∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ = π/2 - π/4 = π/4

Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

(1/4) * (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} 1/cos^4θ dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Which is exactly the same as in cylindrical coordinates! So indeed, the spherical coordinate approach also leads to the same integral, which evaluates to π/12. Therefore, both coordinate systems lead to the same result, but cylindrical coordinates perhaps made it a bit more straightforward because the limits for z were simpler.

So in conclusion, the integral simplifies to π/12 when converted to cylindrical coordinates (or spherical, but cylindrical was perhaps easier here). Therefore, the answer is π/12.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To convert the given triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical coordinates, we start by analyzing the region of integration and the integrand. The integral is:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

The region of integration is bounded by the cone \( z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the xy-plane. In cylindrical coordinates, this region is described by \( 0 \leq r \leq \frac{1}{\cos\theta} \), \( 0 \leq z \leq r \), and \( 0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{4} \).

The integrand in cylindrical coordinates becomes:
\[
\frac{(r^2)^{3/2}}{r^2 + z^2} = \frac{r^3}{r^2 + z^2}
\]

Including the Jacobian determinant \( r \), the integral transforms to:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( z \):
\[
\int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz = r^4 \left[ \frac{1}{r} \arctan\left(\frac{z}{r}\right) \right]_{0}^{r} = r^4 \left( \frac{\pi}{4r} \right) = \frac{\pi}{4} r^3
\]

Next, integrate with respect to \( r \):
\[
\int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \frac{\pi}{4} r^3 \, dr = \frac{\pi}{4} \left[ \frac{r^4}{4} \right]_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} = \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta
\]

Finally, integrate with respect to \( \theta \):
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{16} \int_{0}^{\pi/4} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta
\]

Using the substitution \( u = \tan\theta \), the integral of \( \sec^4\theta \) is evaluated as:
\[
\int \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \tan\theta + \frac{1}{3} \tan^3\theta \Big|_{0}^{\pi/4} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Thus, the integral simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\pi}{16} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{\pi}{12}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to convert this triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to either cylindrical or spherical coordinates. The integral is given as:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

First, I should probably understand the region of integration and see which coordinate system—cylindrical or spherical—would make things simpler. Let me start by analyzing the limits of integration.

Looking at the outermost integral, x goes from 0 to 1. Then, for each x, y goes from 0 to x. So in the xy-plane, this is a triangular region where y ranges from 0 to x, and x itself goes up to 1. Then, for each (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). That upper limit for z is interesting—it&#x27;s the equation of a cone, right? Because in Cartesian coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is a cone opening upwards with its vertex at the origin. So the region of integration is bounded below by the xy-plane (z=0) and above by this cone.

So, visualizing this, we have a region that&#x27;s a portion of a cone. Now, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} divided by (x^2 + y^2 + z^2). Let&#x27;s note that x^2 + y^2 is r^2 in cylindrical coordinates, and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is r^2 in spherical coordinates (but r in spherical is different from cylindrical). Hmm, so maybe spherical coordinates could help here because the denominator is the square of the distance from the origin, i.e., the radius in spherical coordinates.

But wait, the numerator is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} which is r^3 in cylindrical coordinates. The denominator is (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) which is r^2 in spherical coordinates (if we use r for spherical as the radial distance). So maybe converting to spherical coordinates would make the integrand simplify nicely. Let me check.

Alternatively, cylindrical coordinates might also work. Let&#x27;s consider both options.

First, let&#x27;s recall the conversions:

Cylindrical coordinates:
x = r cosθ
y = r sinθ
z = z
Jacobian determinant is r.

Spherical coordinates:
x = ρ sinφ cosθ
y = ρ sinφ sinθ
z = ρ cosφ
Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ.

Given the integrand involves both (x^2 + y^2) and (x^2 + y^2 + z^2), perhaps spherical coordinates would be better, since in spherical coordinates, x^2 + y^2 = ρ^2 sin^2φ and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = ρ^2. So substituting these into the integrand:

Numerator: (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} = (ρ^2 sin^2φ)^{3/2} = ρ^3 sin^3φ

Denominator: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = ρ^2

So the integrand becomes ρ^3 sin^3φ / ρ^2 = ρ sin^3φ

Then, the integrand simplifies to ρ sin^3φ. The Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ, so the entire integral in spherical coordinates would be:

∫∫∫ (ρ sin^3φ) * ρ^2 sinφ dρ dφ dθ = ∫∫∫ ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, that seems manageable. But let&#x27;s check the limits of integration in spherical coordinates.

Original limits:

x from 0 to 1

y from 0 to x

z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

First, in spherical coordinates, the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) becomes ρ cosφ = sqrt(ρ^2 sin^2φ) = ρ sinφ. So:

ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ =&gt; cosφ = sinφ =&gt; tanφ = 1 =&gt; φ = π/4

So the upper limit for z is the cone φ = π/4. The lower limit for z is 0, which corresponds to φ = π/2 (the xy-plane), but wait, no. Wait, z goes from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). When z=0, that&#x27;s the xy-plane (φ=π/2). The upper limit is the cone φ=π/4. So in spherical coordinates, φ would go from π/4 to π/2. Wait, let me check:

In spherical coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is equivalent to ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ, so φ = π/4 as above. So for each (x, y), z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) up to the cone at φ=π/4. But actually, in spherical coordinates, varying z with fixed x and y corresponds to moving along a line of constant θ and φ? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. For a given (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). So in spherical terms, for a given radius in the xy-plane (r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)), z goes from 0 up to r. So in spherical coordinates, that would translate to ρ cosφ = z, and z goes up to r = ρ sinφ. So ρ cosφ &lt;= ρ sinφ =&gt; tanφ &gt;= 1 =&gt; φ &gt;= π/4, but since z is going from 0 to r, that would mean φ is between π/4 (when z=r) and π/2 (when z=0). Wait, but ρ is a variable here. Maybe I need to parametrize this.

Alternatively, maybe cylindrical coordinates would be better here. Let me try cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, z = z. The Jacobian is r.

The limits:

Original x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, so in cylindrical coordinates, θ goes from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, which is the line y=x in the first quadrant, so θ from 0 to π/4. Then r would go from 0 to something? Wait, x goes from 0 to 1, and y from 0 to x. Let me visualize this in the xy-plane. When x is from 0 to 1, and for each x, y is from 0 to x. So this is a triangular region in the xy-plane bounded by x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, which is the same as θ from 0 to π/4 and r from 0 to secθ, because x = r cosθ, so r = x / cosθ. When x=1, r = 1 / cosθ. So in cylindrical coordinates, the r limits would be from 0 to 1 / cosθ, but θ from 0 to π/4. Wait, let me verify:

If we fix θ, then in the original limits, y goes from 0 to x. In cylindrical coordinates, y = r sinθ and x = r cosθ. So y &lt;= x implies r sinθ &lt;= r cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4. That&#x27;s correct. So θ ranges from 0 to π/4. Then, for each θ, x goes from 0 to 1. Since x = r cosθ, then r cosθ goes from 0 to 1. So r goes from 0 to 1 / cosθ. Therefore, in cylindrical coordinates, the limits would be θ from 0 to π/4, r from 0 to 1 / cosθ, and z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = r.

So the z limits in cylindrical coordinates are from 0 to r. Then, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} / (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = (r^2)^{3/2} / (r^2 + z^2) = r^3 / (r^2 + z^2). Then, the integral becomes:

∫ (θ=0 to π/4) ∫ (r=0 to 1/cosθ) ∫ (z=0 to r) [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r dz dr dθ

Wait, the Jacobian is r, so the integrand becomes [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r = r^4 / (r^2 + z^2). So the integral in cylindrical coordinates is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

Hmm, is this easier than the original Cartesian integral? The original integral had a complicated integrand, but maybe in cylindrical coordinates, integrating with respect to z first might be manageable.

Alternatively, in spherical coordinates, let&#x27;s see. The integrand becomes ρ sin^3φ, and the Jacobian is ρ^2 sinφ, so overall ρ^3 sin^4φ. The limits in spherical coordinates would require figuring out ρ, φ, θ.

First, θ is from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, similar to cylindrical coordinates.

φ is from π/4 to π/2 because z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) to the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) (φ=π/4).

ρ is a bit trickier. For each direction (θ, φ), ρ starts at 0 and goes out to the maximum value within the region. But the original x goes up to 1. Let&#x27;s see. In spherical coordinates, x = ρ sinφ cosθ. The original x goes from 0 to 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;= 1. Therefore, ρ &lt;= 1 / (sinφ cosθ). But this seems complicated. However, the original limits also have y &lt;= x, which in spherical coordinates is ρ sinφ sinθ &lt;= ρ sinφ cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4, as before. So θ is from 0 to π/4. The upper limit for x is 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;=1. So ρ &lt;= 1/(sinφ cosθ). So in spherical coordinates, the integral would be:

∫_{θ=0}^{π/4} ∫_{φ=π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{ρ=0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ \, dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, integrating ρ^3 is straightforward, but the upper limit for ρ is 1/(sinφ cosθ), which when integrated would lead to terms with 1/(sinφ cosθ)^4, which might complicate things. Then integrating over φ and θ could be messy. So maybe spherical coordinates aren&#x27;t the best here.

Alternatively, in cylindrical coordinates, after integrating z first, maybe it&#x27;s manageable.

So let&#x27;s stick with cylindrical coordinates for now. Let me write out the integral again:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

So first, integrate with respect to z:

Let’s compute the inner integral ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz

Since r is treated as a constant with respect to z, this becomes r^4 ∫_{0}^{r} 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz

The integral of 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz is (1/r) arctan(z/r) ) + C

So evaluating from 0 to r:

(1/r) [ arctan(r/r) - arctan(0/r) ] = (1/r)[ arctan(1) - arctan(0) ] = (1/r)(π/4 - 0) = π/(4r)

Therefore, the inner integral becomes r^4 * π/(4r) = (π/4) r^3

So now, the integral reduces to:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} (π/4) r^3 dr dθ

= (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr ] dθ

Compute the integral over r:

∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr = [ (1/4) r^4 ] from 0 to 1/cosθ = (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So now:

I = (π/4) * (1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} (1/cosθ)^4 dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Hmm, integrating sec^4θ. The integral of sec^4θ dθ is a standard integral. Recall that ∫ sec^nθ dθ can be done using reduction formulas or using substitution. Let me recall:

∫ sec^4θ dθ = ∫ sec^2θ * sec^2θ dθ. Let’s use the identity sec^2θ = 1 + tan^2θ.

So:

= ∫ (1 + tan^2θ) sec^2θ dθ

Let u = tanθ, then du = sec^2θ dθ. Then the integral becomes:

∫ (1 + u^2) du = u + (1/3)u^3 + C = tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ + C

Therefore, the integral of sec^4θ dθ from 0 to π/4 is:

[ tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ ] from 0 to π/4

At π/4: tan(π/4) = 1, so 1 + (1/3)(1)^3 = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3

At 0: tan(0) = 0, so 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, the integral is 4/3 - 0 = 4/3

Therefore, I = (π/16) * (4/3) = π/12

So the final result is π/12.

Wait, let me verify once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make any mistakes.

Starting from the original integral:

Converted to cylindrical coordinates, ended up with:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz dr dθ

Integrated over z first:

Integral over z gives (π/4) r^3

Then integrated over r:

(1/4) r^4 evaluated from 0 to 1/cosθ gives (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So I becomes (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ = (π/16)*(4/3) = π/12

That seems correct. Let me check if converting to spherical coordinates would have been easier. Let me try that approach as a sanity check.

In spherical coordinates, the integral is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

First, integrate over ρ:

∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 dρ = [ (1/4) ρ^4 ] from 0 to 1/(sinφ cosθ) = (1/4)(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4

So the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} (1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 sin^4φ dφ dθ

Simplify the integrand:

(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 * sin^4φ = (1/sin^4φ cos^4θ) * sin^4φ = 1/(cos^4θ) * 1

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ ] / cos^4θ dθ

But wait, integrating over φ from π/4 to π/2:

∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ = π/2 - π/4 = π/4

Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

(1/4) * (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} 1/cos^4θ dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Which is exactly the same as in cylindrical coordinates! So indeed, the spherical coordinate approach also leads to the same integral, which evaluates to π/12. Therefore, both coordinate systems lead to the same result, but cylindrical coordinates perhaps made it a bit more straightforward because the limits for z were simpler.

So in conclusion, the integral simplifies to π/12 when converted to cylindrical coordinates (or spherical, but cylindrical was perhaps easier here). Therefore, the answer is π/12.

To convert the given triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical coordinates, we start by analyzing the region of integration and the integrand. The integral is:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

The region of integration is bounded by the cone \( z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the xy-plane. In cylindrical coordinates, this region is described by \( 0 \leq r \leq \frac{1}{\cos\theta} \), \( 0 \leq z \leq r \), and \( 0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{4} \).

The integrand in cylindrical coordinates becomes:
\[
\frac{(r^2)^{3/2}}{r^2 + z^2} = \frac{r^3}{r^2 + z^2}
\]

Including the Jacobian determinant \( r \), the integral transforms to:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( z \):
\[
\int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz = r^4 \left[ \frac{1}{r} \arctan\left(\frac{z}{r}\right) \right]_{0}^{r} = r^4 \left( \frac{\pi}{4r} \right) = \frac{\pi}{4} r^3
\]

Next, integrate with respect to \( r \):
\[
\int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \frac{\pi}{4} r^3 \, dr = \frac{\pi}{4} \left[ \frac{r^4}{4} \right]_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} = \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta
\]

Finally, integrate with respect to \( \theta \):
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{16} \int_{0}^{\pi/4} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta
\]

Using the substitution \( u = \tan\theta \), the integral of \( \sec^4\theta \) is evaluated as:
\[
\int \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \tan\theta + \frac{1}{3} \tan^3\theta \Big|_{0}^{\pi/4} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Thus, the integral simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\pi}{16} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{\pi}{12}
\]

The final answer is:
\[

So the integrand becomes ρ^3 sin^3φ / ρ^2 = ρ sin^3φ

Then, the integrand simplifies to ρ sin^3φ. The Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ, so the entire integral in spherical coordinates would be:

∫∫∫ (ρ sin^3φ) * ρ^2 sinφ dρ dφ dθ = ∫∫∫ ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, that seems manageable. But let&#x27;s check the limits of integration in spherical coordinates.

Original limits:

x from 0 to 1

y from 0 to x

z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

First, in spherical coordinates, the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) becomes ρ cosφ = sqrt(ρ^2 sin^2φ) = ρ sinφ. So:

ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ =&gt; cosφ = sinφ =&gt; tanφ = 1 =&gt; φ = π/4

So the upper limit for z is the cone φ = π/4. The lower limit for z is 0, which corresponds to φ = π/2 (the xy-plane), but wait, no. Wait, z goes from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). When z=0, that&#x27;s the xy-plane (φ=π/2). The upper limit is the cone φ=π/4. So in spherical coordinates, φ would go from π/4 to π/2. Wait, let me check:

In spherical coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is equivalent to ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ, so φ = π/4 as above. So for each (x, y), z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) up to the cone at φ=π/4. But actually, in spherical coordinates, varying z with fixed x and y corresponds to moving along a line of constant θ and φ? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. For a given (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). So in spherical terms, for a given radius in the xy-plane (r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)), z goes from 0 up to r. So in spherical coordinates, that would translate to ρ cosφ = z, and z goes up to r = ρ sinφ. So ρ cosφ &lt;= ρ sinφ =&gt; tanφ &gt;= 1 =&gt; φ &gt;= π/4, but since z is going from 0 to r, that would mean φ is between π/4 (when z=r) and π/2 (when z=0). Wait, but ρ is a variable here. Maybe I need to parametrize this.

Alternatively, maybe cylindrical coordinates would be better here. Let me try cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, z = z. The Jacobian is r.

The limits:

Original x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, so in cylindrical coordinates, θ goes from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, which is the line y=x in the first quadrant, so θ from 0 to π/4. Then r would go from 0 to something? Wait, x goes from 0 to 1, and y from 0 to x. Let me visualize this in the xy-plane. When x is from 0 to 1, and for each x, y is from 0 to x. So this is a triangular region in the xy-plane bounded by x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, which is the same as θ from 0 to π/4 and r from 0 to secθ, because x = r cosθ, so r = x / cosθ. When x=1, r = 1 / cosθ. So in cylindrical coordinates, the r limits would be from 0 to 1 / cosθ, but θ from 0 to π/4. Wait, let me verify:

If we fix θ, then in the original limits, y goes from 0 to x. In cylindrical coordinates, y = r sinθ and x = r cosθ. So y &lt;= x implies r sinθ &lt;= r cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4. That&#x27;s correct. So θ ranges from 0 to π/4. Then, for each θ, x goes from 0 to 1. Since x = r cosθ, then r cosθ goes from 0 to 1. So r goes from 0 to 1 / cosθ. Therefore, in cylindrical coordinates, the limits would be θ from 0 to π/4, r from 0 to 1 / cosθ, and z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = r.

So the z limits in cylindrical coordinates are from 0 to r. Then, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} / (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = (r^2)^{3/2} / (r^2 + z^2) = r^3 / (r^2 + z^2). Then, the integral becomes:

∫ (θ=0 to π/4) ∫ (r=0 to 1/cosθ) ∫ (z=0 to r) [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r dz dr dθ

Wait, the Jacobian is r, so the integrand becomes [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r = r^4 / (r^2 + z^2). So the integral in cylindrical coordinates is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

Hmm, is this easier than the original Cartesian integral? The original integral had a complicated integrand, but maybe in cylindrical coordinates, integrating with respect to z first might be manageable.

Alternatively, in spherical coordinates, let&#x27;s see. The integrand becomes ρ sin^3φ, and the Jacobian is ρ^2 sinφ, so overall ρ^3 sin^4φ. The limits in spherical coordinates would require figuring out ρ, φ, θ.

First, θ is from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, similar to cylindrical coordinates.

φ is from π/4 to π/2 because z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) to the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) (φ=π/4).

ρ is a bit trickier. For each direction (θ, φ), ρ starts at 0 and goes out to the maximum value within the region. But the original x goes up to 1. Let&#x27;s see. In spherical coordinates, x = ρ sinφ cosθ. The original x goes from 0 to 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;= 1. Therefore, ρ &lt;= 1 / (sinφ cosθ). But this seems complicated. However, the original limits also have y &lt;= x, which in spherical coordinates is ρ sinφ sinθ &lt;= ρ sinφ cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4, as before. So θ is from 0 to π/4. The upper limit for x is 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;=1. So ρ &lt;= 1/(sinφ cosθ). So in spherical coordinates, the integral would be:

∫_{θ=0}^{π/4} ∫_{φ=π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{ρ=0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ \, dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, integrating ρ^3 is straightforward, but the upper limit for ρ is 1/(sinφ cosθ), which when integrated would lead to terms with 1/(sinφ cosθ)^4, which might complicate things. Then integrating over φ and θ could be messy. So maybe spherical coordinates aren&#x27;t the best here.

Alternatively, in cylindrical coordinates, after integrating z first, maybe it&#x27;s manageable.

So let&#x27;s stick with cylindrical coordinates for now. Let me write out the integral again:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

So first, integrate with respect to z:

Let’s compute the inner integral ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz

Since r is treated as a constant with respect to z, this becomes r^4 ∫_{0}^{r} 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz

The integral of 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz is (1/r) arctan(z/r) ) + C

So evaluating from 0 to r:

(1/r) [ arctan(r/r) - arctan(0/r) ] = (1/r)[ arctan(1) - arctan(0) ] = (1/r)(π/4 - 0) = π/(4r)

Therefore, the inner integral becomes r^4 * π/(4r) = (π/4) r^3

So now, the integral reduces to:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} (π/4) r^3 dr dθ

= (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr ] dθ

Compute the integral over r:

∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr = [ (1/4) r^4 ] from 0 to 1/cosθ = (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So now:

I = (π/4) * (1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} (1/cosθ)^4 dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Hmm, integrating sec^4θ. The integral of sec^4θ dθ is a standard integral. Recall that ∫ sec^nθ dθ can be done using reduction formulas or using substitution. Let me recall:

∫ sec^4θ dθ = ∫ sec^2θ * sec^2θ dθ. Let’s use the identity sec^2θ = 1 + tan^2θ.

So:

= ∫ (1 + tan^2θ) sec^2θ dθ

Let u = tanθ, then du = sec^2θ dθ. Then the integral becomes:

∫ (1 + u^2) du = u + (1/3)u^3 + C = tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ + C

Therefore, the integral of sec^4θ dθ from 0 to π/4 is:

[ tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ ] from 0 to π/4

At π/4: tan(π/4) = 1, so 1 + (1/3)(1)^3 = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3

At 0: tan(0) = 0, so 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, the integral is 4/3 - 0 = 4/3

Therefore, I = (π/16) * (4/3) = π/12

So the final result is π/12.

Wait, let me verify once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make any mistakes.

Starting from the original integral:

Converted to cylindrical coordinates, ended up with:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz dr dθ

Integrated over z first:

Integral over z gives (π/4) r^3

Then integrated over r:

(1/4) r^4 evaluated from 0 to 1/cosθ gives (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So I becomes (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ = (π/16)*(4/3) = π/12

That seems correct. Let me check if converting to spherical coordinates would have been easier. Let me try that approach as a sanity check.

In spherical coordinates, the integral is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

First, integrate over ρ:

∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 dρ = [ (1/4) ρ^4 ] from 0 to 1/(sinφ cosθ) = (1/4)(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4

So the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} (1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 sin^4φ dφ dθ

Simplify the integrand:

(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 * sin^4φ = (1/sin^4φ cos^4θ) * sin^4φ = 1/(cos^4θ) * 1

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ ] / cos^4θ dθ

But wait, integrating over φ from π/4 to π/2:

∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ = π/2 - π/4 = π/4

Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

(1/4) * (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} 1/cos^4θ dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Which is exactly the same as in cylindrical coordinates! So indeed, the spherical coordinate approach also leads to the same integral, which evaluates to π/12. Therefore, both coordinate systems lead to the same result, but cylindrical coordinates perhaps made it a bit more straightforward because the limits for z were simpler.

So in conclusion, the integral simplifies to π/12 when converted to cylindrical coordinates (or spherical, but cylindrical was perhaps easier here). Therefore, the answer is π/12.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To convert the given triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical coordinates, we start by analyzing the region of integration and the integrand. The integral is:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

The region of integration is bounded by the cone \( z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the xy-plane. In cylindrical coordinates, this region is described by \( 0 \leq r \leq \frac{1}{\cos\theta} \), \( 0 \leq z \leq r \), and \( 0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{4} \).

The integrand in cylindrical coordinates becomes:
\[
\frac{(r^2)^{3/2}}{r^2 + z^2} = \frac{r^3}{r^2 + z^2}
\]

Including the Jacobian determinant \( r \), the integral transforms to:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( z \):
\[
\int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz = r^4 \left[ \frac{1}{r} \arctan\left(\frac{z}{r}\right) \right]_{0}^{r} = r^4 \left( \frac{\pi}{4r} \right) = \frac{\pi}{4} r^3
\]

Next, integrate with respect to \( r \):
\[
\int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \frac{\pi}{4} r^3 \, dr = \frac{\pi}{4} \left[ \frac{r^4}{4} \right]_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} = \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta
\]

Finally, integrate with respect to \( \theta \):
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{16} \int_{0}^{\pi/4} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta
\]

Using the substitution \( u = \tan\theta \), the integral of \( \sec^4\theta \) is evaluated as:
\[
\int \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \tan\theta + \frac{1}{3} \tan^3\theta \Big|_{0}^{\pi/4} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Thus, the integral simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\pi}{16} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{\pi}{12}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to convert this triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to either cylindrical or spherical coordinates. The integral is given as:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

First, I should probably understand the region of integration and see which coordinate system—cylindrical or spherical—would make things simpler. Let me start by analyzing the limits of integration.

Looking at the outermost integral, x goes from 0 to 1. Then, for each x, y goes from 0 to x. So in the xy-plane, this is a triangular region where y ranges from 0 to x, and x itself goes up to 1. Then, for each (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). That upper limit for z is interesting—it&#x27;s the equation of a cone, right? Because in Cartesian coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is a cone opening upwards with its vertex at the origin. So the region of integration is bounded below by the xy-plane (z=0) and above by this cone.

So, visualizing this, we have a region that&#x27;s a portion of a cone. Now, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} divided by (x^2 + y^2 + z^2). Let&#x27;s note that x^2 + y^2 is r^2 in cylindrical coordinates, and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is r^2 in spherical coordinates (but r in spherical is different from cylindrical). Hmm, so maybe spherical coordinates could help here because the denominator is the square of the distance from the origin, i.e., the radius in spherical coordinates.

But wait, the numerator is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} which is r^3 in cylindrical coordinates. The denominator is (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) which is r^2 in spherical coordinates (if we use r for spherical as the radial distance). So maybe converting to spherical coordinates would make the integrand simplify nicely. Let me check.

Alternatively, cylindrical coordinates might also work. Let&#x27;s consider both options.

First, let&#x27;s recall the conversions:

Cylindrical coordinates:
x = r cosθ
y = r sinθ
z = z
Jacobian determinant is r.

Spherical coordinates:
x = ρ sinφ cosθ
y = ρ sinφ sinθ
z = ρ cosφ
Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ.

Given the integrand involves both (x^2 + y^2) and (x^2 + y^2 + z^2), perhaps spherical coordinates would be better, since in spherical coordinates, x^2 + y^2 = ρ^2 sin^2φ and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = ρ^2. So substituting these into the integrand:

Numerator: (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} = (ρ^2 sin^2φ)^{3/2} = ρ^3 sin^3φ

Denominator: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = ρ^2

So the integrand becomes ρ^3 sin^3φ / ρ^2 = ρ sin^3φ

Then, the integrand simplifies to ρ sin^3φ. The Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ, so the entire integral in spherical coordinates would be:

∫∫∫ (ρ sin^3φ) * ρ^2 sinφ dρ dφ dθ = ∫∫∫ ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, that seems manageable. But let&#x27;s check the limits of integration in spherical coordinates.

Original limits:

x from 0 to 1

y from 0 to x

z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

First, in spherical coordinates, the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) becomes ρ cosφ = sqrt(ρ^2 sin^2φ) = ρ sinφ. So:

ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ =&gt; cosφ = sinφ =&gt; tanφ = 1 =&gt; φ = π/4

So the upper limit for z is the cone φ = π/4. The lower limit for z is 0, which corresponds to φ = π/2 (the xy-plane), but wait, no. Wait, z goes from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). When z=0, that&#x27;s the xy-plane (φ=π/2). The upper limit is the cone φ=π/4. So in spherical coordinates, φ would go from π/4 to π/2. Wait, let me check:

In spherical coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is equivalent to ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ, so φ = π/4 as above. So for each (x, y), z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) up to the cone at φ=π/4. But actually, in spherical coordinates, varying z with fixed x and y corresponds to moving along a line of constant θ and φ? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. For a given (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). So in spherical terms, for a given radius in the xy-plane (r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)), z goes from 0 up to r. So in spherical coordinates, that would translate to ρ cosφ = z, and z goes up to r = ρ sinφ. So ρ cosφ &lt;= ρ sinφ =&gt; tanφ &gt;= 1 =&gt; φ &gt;= π/4, but since z is going from 0 to r, that would mean φ is between π/4 (when z=r) and π/2 (when z=0). Wait, but ρ is a variable here. Maybe I need to parametrize this.

Alternatively, maybe cylindrical coordinates would be better here. Let me try cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, z = z. The Jacobian is r.

The limits:

Original x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, so in cylindrical coordinates, θ goes from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, which is the line y=x in the first quadrant, so θ from 0 to π/4. Then r would go from 0 to something? Wait, x goes from 0 to 1, and y from 0 to x. Let me visualize this in the xy-plane. When x is from 0 to 1, and for each x, y is from 0 to x. So this is a triangular region in the xy-plane bounded by x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, which is the same as θ from 0 to π/4 and r from 0 to secθ, because x = r cosθ, so r = x / cosθ. When x=1, r = 1 / cosθ. So in cylindrical coordinates, the r limits would be from 0 to 1 / cosθ, but θ from 0 to π/4. Wait, let me verify:

If we fix θ, then in the original limits, y goes from 0 to x. In cylindrical coordinates, y = r sinθ and x = r cosθ. So y &lt;= x implies r sinθ &lt;= r cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4. That&#x27;s correct. So θ ranges from 0 to π/4. Then, for each θ, x goes from 0 to 1. Since x = r cosθ, then r cosθ goes from 0 to 1. So r goes from 0 to 1 / cosθ. Therefore, in cylindrical coordinates, the limits would be θ from 0 to π/4, r from 0 to 1 / cosθ, and z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = r.

So the z limits in cylindrical coordinates are from 0 to r. Then, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} / (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = (r^2)^{3/2} / (r^2 + z^2) = r^3 / (r^2 + z^2). Then, the integral becomes:

∫ (θ=0 to π/4) ∫ (r=0 to 1/cosθ) ∫ (z=0 to r) [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r dz dr dθ

Wait, the Jacobian is r, so the integrand becomes [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r = r^4 / (r^2 + z^2). So the integral in cylindrical coordinates is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

Hmm, is this easier than the original Cartesian integral? The original integral had a complicated integrand, but maybe in cylindrical coordinates, integrating with respect to z first might be manageable.

Alternatively, in spherical coordinates, let&#x27;s see. The integrand becomes ρ sin^3φ, and the Jacobian is ρ^2 sinφ, so overall ρ^3 sin^4φ. The limits in spherical coordinates would require figuring out ρ, φ, θ.

First, θ is from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, similar to cylindrical coordinates.

φ is from π/4 to π/2 because z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) to the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) (φ=π/4).

ρ is a bit trickier. For each direction (θ, φ), ρ starts at 0 and goes out to the maximum value within the region. But the original x goes up to 1. Let&#x27;s see. In spherical coordinates, x = ρ sinφ cosθ. The original x goes from 0 to 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;= 1. Therefore, ρ &lt;= 1 / (sinφ cosθ). But this seems complicated. However, the original limits also have y &lt;= x, which in spherical coordinates is ρ sinφ sinθ &lt;= ρ sinφ cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4, as before. So θ is from 0 to π/4. The upper limit for x is 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;=1. So ρ &lt;= 1/(sinφ cosθ). So in spherical coordinates, the integral would be:

∫_{θ=0}^{π/4} ∫_{φ=π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{ρ=0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ \, dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, integrating ρ^3 is straightforward, but the upper limit for ρ is 1/(sinφ cosθ), which when integrated would lead to terms with 1/(sinφ cosθ)^4, which might complicate things. Then integrating over φ and θ could be messy. So maybe spherical coordinates aren&#x27;t the best here.

Alternatively, in cylindrical coordinates, after integrating z first, maybe it&#x27;s manageable.

So let&#x27;s stick with cylindrical coordinates for now. Let me write out the integral again:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

So first, integrate with respect to z:

Let’s compute the inner integral ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz

Since r is treated as a constant with respect to z, this becomes r^4 ∫_{0}^{r} 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz

The integral of 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz is (1/r) arctan(z/r) ) + C

So evaluating from 0 to r:

(1/r) [ arctan(r/r) - arctan(0/r) ] = (1/r)[ arctan(1) - arctan(0) ] = (1/r)(π/4 - 0) = π/(4r)

Therefore, the inner integral becomes r^4 * π/(4r) = (π/4) r^3

So now, the integral reduces to:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} (π/4) r^3 dr dθ

= (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr ] dθ

Compute the integral over r:

∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr = [ (1/4) r^4 ] from 0 to 1/cosθ = (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So now:

I = (π/4) * (1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} (1/cosθ)^4 dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Hmm, integrating sec^4θ. The integral of sec^4θ dθ is a standard integral. Recall that ∫ sec^nθ dθ can be done using reduction formulas or using substitution. Let me recall:

∫ sec^4θ dθ = ∫ sec^2θ * sec^2θ dθ. Let’s use the identity sec^2θ = 1 + tan^2θ.

So:

= ∫ (1 + tan^2θ) sec^2θ dθ

Let u = tanθ, then du = sec^2θ dθ. Then the integral becomes:

∫ (1 + u^2) du = u + (1/3)u^3 + C = tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ + C

Therefore, the integral of sec^4θ dθ from 0 to π/4 is:

[ tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ ] from 0 to π/4

At π/4: tan(π/4) = 1, so 1 + (1/3)(1)^3 = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3

At 0: tan(0) = 0, so 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, the integral is 4/3 - 0 = 4/3

Therefore, I = (π/16) * (4/3) = π/12

So the final result is π/12.

Wait, let me verify once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make any mistakes.

Starting from the original integral:

Converted to cylindrical coordinates, ended up with:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz dr dθ

Integrated over z first:

Integral over z gives (π/4) r^3

Then integrated over r:

(1/4) r^4 evaluated from 0 to 1/cosθ gives (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So I becomes (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ = (π/16)*(4/3) = π/12

That seems correct. Let me check if converting to spherical coordinates would have been easier. Let me try that approach as a sanity check.

In spherical coordinates, the integral is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

First, integrate over ρ:

∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 dρ = [ (1/4) ρ^4 ] from 0 to 1/(sinφ cosθ) = (1/4)(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4

So the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} (1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 sin^4φ dφ dθ

Simplify the integrand:

(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 * sin^4φ = (1/sin^4φ cos^4θ) * sin^4φ = 1/(cos^4θ) * 1

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ ] / cos^4θ dθ

But wait, integrating over φ from π/4 to π/2:

∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ = π/2 - π/4 = π/4

Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

(1/4) * (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} 1/cos^4θ dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Which is exactly the same as in cylindrical coordinates! So indeed, the spherical coordinate approach also leads to the same integral, which evaluates to π/12. Therefore, both coordinate systems lead to the same result, but cylindrical coordinates perhaps made it a bit more straightforward because the limits for z were simpler.

So in conclusion, the integral simplifies to π/12 when converted to cylindrical coordinates (or spherical, but cylindrical was perhaps easier here). Therefore, the answer is π/12.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To convert the given triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical coordinates, we start by analyzing the region of integration and the integrand. The integral is:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

The region of integration is bounded by the cone \( z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the xy-plane. In cylindrical coordinates, this region is described by \( 0 \leq r \leq \frac{1}{\cos\theta} \), \( 0 \leq z \leq r \), and \( 0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{4} \).

The integrand in cylindrical coordinates becomes:
\[
\frac{(r^2)^{3/2}}{r^2 + z^2} = \frac{r^3}{r^2 + z^2}
\]

Including the Jacobian determinant \( r \), the integral transforms to:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( z \):
\[
\int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz = r^4 \left[ \frac{1}{r} \arctan\left(\frac{z}{r}\right) \right]_{0}^{r} = r^4 \left( \frac{\pi}{4r} \right) = \frac{\pi}{4} r^3
\]

Next, integrate with respect to \( r \):
\[
\int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \frac{\pi}{4} r^3 \, dr = \frac{\pi}{4} \left[ \frac{r^4}{4} \right]_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} = \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta
\]

Finally, integrate with respect to \( \theta \):
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{16} \int_{0}^{\pi/4} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta
\]

Using the substitution \( u = \tan\theta \), the integral of \( \sec^4\theta \) is evaluated as:
\[
\int \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \tan\theta + \frac{1}{3} \tan^3\theta \Big|_{0}^{\pi/4} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Thus, the integral simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\pi}{16} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{\pi}{12}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to convert this triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to either cylindrical or spherical coordinates. The integral is given as:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

First, I should probably understand the region of integration and see which coordinate system—cylindrical or spherical—would make things simpler. Let me start by analyzing the limits of integration.

Looking at the outermost integral, x goes from 0 to 1. Then, for each x, y goes from 0 to x. So in the xy-plane, this is a triangular region where y ranges from 0 to x, and x itself goes up to 1. Then, for each (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). That upper limit for z is interesting—it&#x27;s the equation of a cone, right? Because in Cartesian coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is a cone opening upwards with its vertex at the origin. So the region of integration is bounded below by the xy-plane (z=0) and above by this cone.

So, visualizing this, we have a region that&#x27;s a portion of a cone. Now, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} divided by (x^2 + y^2 + z^2). Let&#x27;s note that x^2 + y^2 is r^2 in cylindrical coordinates, and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is r^2 in spherical coordinates (but r in spherical is different from cylindrical). Hmm, so maybe spherical coordinates could help here because the denominator is the square of the distance from the origin, i.e., the radius in spherical coordinates.

But wait, the numerator is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} which is r^3 in cylindrical coordinates. The denominator is (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) which is r^2 in spherical coordinates (if we use r for spherical as the radial distance). So maybe converting to spherical coordinates would make the integrand simplify nicely. Let me check.

Alternatively, cylindrical coordinates might also work. Let&#x27;s consider both options.

First, let&#x27;s recall the conversions:

Cylindrical coordinates:
x = r cosθ
y = r sinθ
z = z
Jacobian determinant is r.

Spherical coordinates:
x = ρ sinφ cosθ
y = ρ sinφ sinθ
z = ρ cosφ
Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ.

Given the integrand involves both (x^2 + y^2) and (x^2 + y^2 + z^2), perhaps spherical coordinates would be better, since in spherical coordinates, x^2 + y^2 = ρ^2 sin^2φ and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = ρ^2. So substituting these into the integrand:

Numerator: (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} = (ρ^2 sin^2φ)^{3/2} = ρ^3 sin^3φ

Denominator: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = ρ^2

So the integrand becomes ρ^3 sin^3φ / ρ^2 = ρ sin^3φ

Then, the integrand simplifies to ρ sin^3φ. The Jacobian determinant is ρ^2 sinφ, so the entire integral in spherical coordinates would be:

∫∫∫ (ρ sin^3φ) * ρ^2 sinφ dρ dφ dθ = ∫∫∫ ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, that seems manageable. But let&#x27;s check the limits of integration in spherical coordinates.

Original limits:

x from 0 to 1

y from 0 to x

z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

First, in spherical coordinates, the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) becomes ρ cosφ = sqrt(ρ^2 sin^2φ) = ρ sinφ. So:

ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ =&gt; cosφ = sinφ =&gt; tanφ = 1 =&gt; φ = π/4

So the upper limit for z is the cone φ = π/4. The lower limit for z is 0, which corresponds to φ = π/2 (the xy-plane), but wait, no. Wait, z goes from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). When z=0, that&#x27;s the xy-plane (φ=π/2). The upper limit is the cone φ=π/4. So in spherical coordinates, φ would go from π/4 to π/2. Wait, let me check:

In spherical coordinates, z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is equivalent to ρ cosφ = ρ sinφ, so φ = π/4 as above. So for each (x, y), z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) up to the cone at φ=π/4. But actually, in spherical coordinates, varying z with fixed x and y corresponds to moving along a line of constant θ and φ? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. For a given (x, y), z goes from 0 up to sqrt(x^2 + y^2). So in spherical terms, for a given radius in the xy-plane (r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)), z goes from 0 up to r. So in spherical coordinates, that would translate to ρ cosφ = z, and z goes up to r = ρ sinφ. So ρ cosφ &lt;= ρ sinφ =&gt; tanφ &gt;= 1 =&gt; φ &gt;= π/4, but since z is going from 0 to r, that would mean φ is between π/4 (when z=r) and π/2 (when z=0). Wait, but ρ is a variable here. Maybe I need to parametrize this.

Alternatively, maybe cylindrical coordinates would be better here. Let me try cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, z = z. The Jacobian is r.

The limits:

Original x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, so in cylindrical coordinates, θ goes from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, which is the line y=x in the first quadrant, so θ from 0 to π/4. Then r would go from 0 to something? Wait, x goes from 0 to 1, and y from 0 to x. Let me visualize this in the xy-plane. When x is from 0 to 1, and for each x, y is from 0 to x. So this is a triangular region in the xy-plane bounded by x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to x, which is the same as θ from 0 to π/4 and r from 0 to secθ, because x = r cosθ, so r = x / cosθ. When x=1, r = 1 / cosθ. So in cylindrical coordinates, the r limits would be from 0 to 1 / cosθ, but θ from 0 to π/4. Wait, let me verify:

If we fix θ, then in the original limits, y goes from 0 to x. In cylindrical coordinates, y = r sinθ and x = r cosθ. So y &lt;= x implies r sinθ &lt;= r cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4. That&#x27;s correct. So θ ranges from 0 to π/4. Then, for each θ, x goes from 0 to 1. Since x = r cosθ, then r cosθ goes from 0 to 1. So r goes from 0 to 1 / cosθ. Therefore, in cylindrical coordinates, the limits would be θ from 0 to π/4, r from 0 to 1 / cosθ, and z from 0 to sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = r.

So the z limits in cylindrical coordinates are from 0 to r. Then, the integrand is (x^2 + y^2)^{3/2} / (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = (r^2)^{3/2} / (r^2 + z^2) = r^3 / (r^2 + z^2). Then, the integral becomes:

∫ (θ=0 to π/4) ∫ (r=0 to 1/cosθ) ∫ (z=0 to r) [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r dz dr dθ

Wait, the Jacobian is r, so the integrand becomes [r^3 / (r^2 + z^2)] * r = r^4 / (r^2 + z^2). So the integral in cylindrical coordinates is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

Hmm, is this easier than the original Cartesian integral? The original integral had a complicated integrand, but maybe in cylindrical coordinates, integrating with respect to z first might be manageable.

Alternatively, in spherical coordinates, let&#x27;s see. The integrand becomes ρ sin^3φ, and the Jacobian is ρ^2 sinφ, so overall ρ^3 sin^4φ. The limits in spherical coordinates would require figuring out ρ, φ, θ.

First, θ is from 0 to π/4 because y goes from 0 to x, similar to cylindrical coordinates.

φ is from π/4 to π/2 because z goes from 0 (φ=π/2) to the cone z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) (φ=π/4).

ρ is a bit trickier. For each direction (θ, φ), ρ starts at 0 and goes out to the maximum value within the region. But the original x goes up to 1. Let&#x27;s see. In spherical coordinates, x = ρ sinφ cosθ. The original x goes from 0 to 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;= 1. Therefore, ρ &lt;= 1 / (sinφ cosθ). But this seems complicated. However, the original limits also have y &lt;= x, which in spherical coordinates is ρ sinφ sinθ &lt;= ρ sinφ cosθ =&gt; tanθ &lt;= 1 =&gt; θ &lt;= π/4, as before. So θ is from 0 to π/4. The upper limit for x is 1, so ρ sinφ cosθ &lt;=1. So ρ &lt;= 1/(sinφ cosθ). So in spherical coordinates, the integral would be:

∫_{θ=0}^{π/4} ∫_{φ=π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{ρ=0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ \, dρ dφ dθ

Hmm, integrating ρ^3 is straightforward, but the upper limit for ρ is 1/(sinφ cosθ), which when integrated would lead to terms with 1/(sinφ cosθ)^4, which might complicate things. Then integrating over φ and θ could be messy. So maybe spherical coordinates aren&#x27;t the best here.

Alternatively, in cylindrical coordinates, after integrating z first, maybe it&#x27;s manageable.

So let&#x27;s stick with cylindrical coordinates for now. Let me write out the integral again:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, dθ

So first, integrate with respect to z:

Let’s compute the inner integral ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz

Since r is treated as a constant with respect to z, this becomes r^4 ∫_{0}^{r} 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz

The integral of 1/(r^2 + z^2) dz is (1/r) arctan(z/r) ) + C

So evaluating from 0 to r:

(1/r) [ arctan(r/r) - arctan(0/r) ] = (1/r)[ arctan(1) - arctan(0) ] = (1/r)(π/4 - 0) = π/(4r)

Therefore, the inner integral becomes r^4 * π/(4r) = (π/4) r^3

So now, the integral reduces to:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} (π/4) r^3 dr dθ

= (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr ] dθ

Compute the integral over r:

∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} r^3 dr = [ (1/4) r^4 ] from 0 to 1/cosθ = (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So now:

I = (π/4) * (1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} (1/cosθ)^4 dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Hmm, integrating sec^4θ. The integral of sec^4θ dθ is a standard integral. Recall that ∫ sec^nθ dθ can be done using reduction formulas or using substitution. Let me recall:

∫ sec^4θ dθ = ∫ sec^2θ * sec^2θ dθ. Let’s use the identity sec^2θ = 1 + tan^2θ.

So:

= ∫ (1 + tan^2θ) sec^2θ dθ

Let u = tanθ, then du = sec^2θ dθ. Then the integral becomes:

∫ (1 + u^2) du = u + (1/3)u^3 + C = tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ + C

Therefore, the integral of sec^4θ dθ from 0 to π/4 is:

[ tanθ + (1/3) tan^3θ ] from 0 to π/4

At π/4: tan(π/4) = 1, so 1 + (1/3)(1)^3 = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3

At 0: tan(0) = 0, so 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, the integral is 4/3 - 0 = 4/3

Therefore, I = (π/16) * (4/3) = π/12

So the final result is π/12.

Wait, let me verify once again to make sure I didn&#x27;t make any mistakes.

Starting from the original integral:

Converted to cylindrical coordinates, ended up with:

I = ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{0}^{1/cosθ} ∫_{0}^{r} [r^4 / (r^2 + z^2)] dz dr dθ

Integrated over z first:

Integral over z gives (π/4) r^3

Then integrated over r:

(1/4) r^4 evaluated from 0 to 1/cosθ gives (1/4)(1/cosθ)^4

So I becomes (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ = (π/16)*(4/3) = π/12

That seems correct. Let me check if converting to spherical coordinates would have been easier. Let me try that approach as a sanity check.

In spherical coordinates, the integral is:

∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} ∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 sin^4φ dρ dφ dθ

First, integrate over ρ:

∫_{0}^{1/(sinφ cosθ)} ρ^3 dρ = [ (1/4) ρ^4 ] from 0 to 1/(sinφ cosθ) = (1/4)(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4

So the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} (1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 sin^4φ dφ dθ

Simplify the integrand:

(1/(sinφ cosθ))^4 * sin^4φ = (1/sin^4φ cos^4θ) * sin^4φ = 1/(cos^4θ) * 1

Therefore, the integral becomes:

(1/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} [ ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ ] / cos^4θ dθ

But wait, integrating over φ from π/4 to π/2:

∫_{π/4}^{π/2} dφ = π/2 - π/4 = π/4

Therefore, the integral simplifies to:

(1/4) * (π/4) ∫_{0}^{π/4} 1/cos^4θ dθ = (π/16) ∫_{0}^{π/4} sec^4θ dθ

Which is exactly the same as in cylindrical coordinates! So indeed, the spherical coordinate approach also leads to the same integral, which evaluates to π/12. Therefore, both coordinate systems lead to the same result, but cylindrical coordinates perhaps made it a bit more straightforward because the limits for z were simpler.

So in conclusion, the integral simplifies to π/12 when converted to cylindrical coordinates (or spherical, but cylindrical was perhaps easier here). Therefore, the answer is π/12.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}
&lt;/think&gt;

To convert the given triple integral from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical coordinates, we start by analyzing the region of integration and the integrand. The integral is:

\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^x \int_0^{ \sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \frac{(x^2+y^2)^{3/2}}{x^2+y^2+z^2}\,dz\,dy\,dx
\]

The region of integration is bounded by the cone \( z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the xy-plane. In cylindrical coordinates, this region is described by \( 0 \leq r \leq \frac{1}{\cos\theta} \), \( 0 \leq z \leq r \), and \( 0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{4} \).

The integrand in cylindrical coordinates becomes:
\[
\frac{(r^2)^{3/2}}{r^2 + z^2} = \frac{r^3}{r^2 + z^2}
\]

Including the Jacobian determinant \( r \), the integral transforms to:
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz \, dr \, d\theta
\]

First, integrate with respect to \( z \):
\[
\int_{0}^{r} \frac{r^4}{r^2 + z^2} \, dz = r^4 \left[ \frac{1}{r} \arctan\left(\frac{z}{r}\right) \right]_{0}^{r} = r^4 \left( \frac{\pi}{4r} \right) = \frac{\pi}{4} r^3
\]

Next, integrate with respect to \( r \):
\[
\int_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} \frac{\pi}{4} r^3 \, dr = \frac{\pi}{4} \left[ \frac{r^4}{4} \right]_{0}^{1/\cos\theta} = \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta
\]

Finally, integrate with respect to \( \theta \):
\[
\int_{0}^{\pi/4} \frac{\pi}{16} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{16} \int_{0}^{\pi/4} \sec^4\theta \, d\theta
\]

Using the substitution \( u = \tan\theta \), the integral of \( \sec^4\theta \) is evaluated as:
\[
\int \sec^4\theta \, d\theta = \tan\theta + \frac{1}{3} \tan^3\theta \Big|_{0}^{\pi/4} = 1 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Thus, the integral simplifies to:
\[
\frac{\pi}{16} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{\pi}{12}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\pi}{12}}

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the liminf of the random walk \( S_n \) is \(-\infty\). The problem states that each \( X_n \) is an i.i.d. random variable with \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = 1) = \frac{2}{3} \). The process starts at \( S_0 = 0 \), and for each \( n \geq 1 \), \( S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n X_k \). The question is asking for \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \).

First, let me recall what liminf means. The liminf of a sequence \( S_n \) as \( n \to \infty \) is the smallest limit point of the sequence. In other words, it&#x27;s the infimum of all the limit points that the sequence approaches infinitely often. So if \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \), that means the sequence \( S_n \) goes arbitrarily low infinitely often. In the context of a random walk, this would imply that the walk recurrently visits every negative level, no matter how far down. 

But wait, in probability theory, when we talk about liminf and limsup of random walks, we often classify them as either transient or recurrent. A recurrent random walk returns to its starting point infinitely often with probability 1, whereas a transient random walk eventually leaves forever with probability 1. However, here we&#x27;re dealing with liminf behavior, which is a bit different. The question is about whether the walk goes to \(-\infty\) infinitely often, not necessarily returning to a specific point.

Given that the steps are i.i.d., each step has a drift. Let me compute the expected value of each step \( X_n \). The expectation is \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = (-1) \times \frac{1}{3} + 1 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{-1 + 2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \). So the drift is positive, which suggests that the walk has a tendency to drift towards \(+\infty\). But the question is about the liminf being \(-\infty\). Even if the walk drifts to \(+\infty\), it might still have liminf \(-\infty\) if it fluctuates enough downwards along the way. However, with a positive drift, maybe such fluctuations are not strong enough?

In one-dimensional random walks, there&#x27;s a concept of whether the walk is recurrent or transient. For symmetric simple random walks (like with equal probability to go left or right), the walk is recurrent in 1D and 2D, but transient in higher dimensions. However, in our case, the walk is not symmetric; it has a drift towards the right (positive direction). So perhaps it&#x27;s transient to the right, meaning that it tends to \(+\infty\) as \( n \to \infty \), but the liminf could still be \(-\infty\) or finite.

Wait, but the liminf is the infimum of the limit points. So even if the walk goes to \(+\infty\), but it fluctuates a lot, the liminf could be finite. For example, if the walk goes to \(+\infty\) but every once in a while comes back down to some finite level, the liminf would be that finite level. But if it can go arbitrarily low infinitely often, then the liminf is \(-\infty\).

So the key is to determine whether, with probability 1, the random walk \( S_n \) will reach any negative level infinitely often. If yes, then the liminf is \(-\infty\). If no, then the liminf is some finite value.

Given the walk has a positive drift, intuition says that it might be transient to \(+\infty\), but I need to check whether it is also &quot;downward transient&quot;, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t revisit negative values infinitely often.

Alternatively, perhaps there&#x27;s a theorem that relates the liminf behavior to the drift.

Alternatively, since each step has positive drift, by the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN), \( S_n / n \) converges almost surely to \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = 1/3 \). Therefore, \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely. Therefore, the liminf of \( S_n \) would be finite? Wait, if \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\), then both liminf and limsup should be \(+\infty\). But that contradicts the idea of liminf being the smallest limit point. Wait, no. If \( S_n \to +\infty \), then all limit points are \(+\infty\), so liminf is \(+\infty\). But in that case, how could liminf be \(-\infty\)?

Wait, maybe I&#x27;m confused. If the walk goes to \(+\infty\) almost surely, then with probability 1, for any large \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf would also be \(+\infty\). But that would suggest that \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

But wait, this contradicts the intuition that even with a positive drift, the walk might have fluctuations below zero. However, according to the SLLN, if the walk has a positive drift, then \( S_n \) tends to infinity almost surely, which would imply that the walk cannot go to \(-\infty\) in the liminf sense. But is that the case?

Wait, let me think again. The liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. Therefore, both liminf and limsup are infinity. Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \). But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the walk does not go to infinity almost surely? But with positive drift, I thought it does. Let me verify. For a random walk with i.i.d. steps with positive expectation, does \( S_n \to +\infty \) almost surely?

Yes, according to the SLLN, \( S_n / n \to 1/3 \) a.s., which implies that \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s. Therefore, almost every sample path goes to infinity. Therefore, for almost every path, for any \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is \(+\infty\), not \(-\infty\). So the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \) should be 0.

But wait, maybe the liminf is different? Let me check with a simple example. Suppose we have a deterministic sequence that tends to infinity. Then its liminf is infinity. If we have a sequence that has some fluctuations but still tends to infinity, then liminf is still infinity. For example, consider \( a_n = n + (-1)^n \). This sequence goes to infinity, and the liminf is infinity. So even with oscillations, if the overall trend is to infinity, liminf and limsup both are infinity.

Therefore, if \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability that \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is zero.

But wait, maybe there&#x27;s a nuance here. Let me recall that liminf is the infimum of the set of limit points. If the walk goes to infinity, then the set of limit points is just {+infty}, so the infimum is +infty. Therefore, the liminf is +infty. So indeed, the probability in question should be 0.

But then, why is the problem asking this? Maybe my reasoning is wrong. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the walk does not go to infinity almost surely. For example, even with positive drift, perhaps there&#x27;s a chance that the walk goes to -infty? But with positive drift, the expectation of the walk is linear in n with a positive slope, and by the SLLN, it converges to +infty. So maybe the walk cannot go to -infty.

Wait, but in some cases, even with positive drift, there can be a finite probability of the walk going to -infty. Wait, but in one dimension, if the walk is transient, it either goes to +infty or -infty. Wait, no. For asymmetric random walks on the integers, if the walk is transient, then it tends to +infty or -infty with certain probabilities. But in our case, the drift is positive, so the transience is towards +infty, but perhaps there is a 0 probability of drifting to -infty.

Wait, but the question is not about lim, but liminf. So even if the walk tends to +infty, it might have liminf -infty if it fluctuates enough. But if the walk is transient with drift to +infty, maybe those downward fluctuations are not strong enough to reach arbitrary low points infinitely often.

Alternatively, let me recall that for a random walk with positive drift, the probability that it ever reaches a negative level -k is less than 1, and actually decays exponentially with k. So, the probability that the walk ever goes below -k is something like \( (q/p)^k \), where p is the probability to go right, q to go left. In our case, p=2/3, q=1/3, so \( (q/p) = 1/2 \). Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -k is \( (1/2)^k \). Therefore, the probability that the walk goes below -k infinitely often is the probability that for infinitely many k, the walk reaches -k. But by Borel-Cantelli lemma, since the sum of probabilities \( \sum (1/2)^k \) converges, by Borel-Cantelli, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, liminf is finite.

Wait, but this contradicts the previous statement from the SLLN. Wait, but according to SLLN, the walk goes to infinity, so the liminf is infinity. But here, the argument is that the walk cannot go below arbitrary negative levels infinitely often. Therefore, the liminf is not -infty. So then, why does the liminf have to be infinity?

Wait, maybe the liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. So liminf is infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty is 0.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a difference between liminf being -infty and the walk going to -infty. If the walk goes to -infty, then liminf would be -infty. If the walk goes to +infty, liminf is +infty. But if the walk oscillates between -infty and +infty, then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. However, in our case, since the walk has positive drift, it goes to +infty almost surely, so liminf and limsup are both +infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Wait, but let me check again. Suppose we have a simple asymmetric random walk on integers with probability p to go right and q=1-p to go left. Then, if p &gt; q, the walk is transient to the right, meaning that it tends to +infty a.s. If p &lt; q, it tends to -infty a.s. If p = q, it&#x27;s recurrent.

In our case, p=2/3 &gt; q=1/3, so the walk is transient to +infty. Therefore, with probability 1, \( S_n \to +\infty \). Therefore, \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the liminf in another way. Even if the walk goes to +infty, maybe it can have liminf -infty if it has infinitely many drops to -infty. But if the walk tends to +infty, then after some finite time, it never goes below a certain level. Therefore, the liminf would be the infimum of the sequence from that point on, which is increasing to infinity, so liminf is infinity.

But perhaps the walk can go to +infty but still have liminf -infty? Wait, no. If the walk goes to +infty, then for any M, there exists N such that for all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= M. Therefore, the liminf is at least M. Since M can be as large as we want, liminf is infinity. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty in that case.

So then, the answer is 0.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. Suppose the walk is transient to the right. Then, with probability 1, S_n tends to +infty. Therefore, liminf S_n = +infty a.s. So indeed, the probability that liminf S_n = -infty is 0. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me? Let me consider another angle.

Suppose that even though the walk tends to +infty, maybe there are infinitely many times when it goes below 0. But even if that&#x27;s the case, the liminf would be the infimum of those points. If the walk goes below 0 infinitely often, but the extent to which it goes below 0 is bounded, then liminf would be some finite negative number. However, if it can go below any negative integer infinitely often, then the liminf would be -infty.

But in our case, with positive drift, is it possible that the walk visits 0 infinitely often? If it&#x27;s transient to the right, then it can only visit 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is also finite.

Wait, but transience to the right means that the walk eventually stays on the right side, right? So, for some N, all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= 0. But is that the case?

Wait, actually, transience to the right means that the walk tends to +infty, but it might revisit the left side (negative numbers) infinitely often. Wait, but if the walk has a positive drift, can it still go below 0 infinitely often?

Hmm, this is a key point. Let me recall that in one dimension, for an asymmetric random walk with drift, whether it is transient or not is determined by the direction of the drift. If the drift is positive, then the walk tends to +infty a.s. But does that mean that it can&#x27;t go below 0 infinitely often?

No, actually, even with a positive drift, the walk might still cross below 0 infinitely often. For example, consider the case where the walk has a small positive drift. Then, there&#x27;s a positive probability that it will cross below 0 infinitely often. Wait, but actually, in the case of asymmetric random walks on integers, starting at 0, with p &gt; q, the walk is transient to +infty, which means that it visits each state finitely many times. Therefore, it can only cross 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is finite.

Wait, this is a crucial point. Let me recall that in a transient random walk to the right, the number of times the walk returns to the origin is finite. Therefore, the walk can only cross below 0 finitely many times. Therefore, after some finite time, the walk remains positive. Therefore, the liminf would be the minimum value achieved by the walk after that finite time, which is positive, and since the walk tends to infinity, the liminf would be infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty would be 0.

Alternatively, maybe in higher dimensions, but in 1D, once the walk is transient, it can&#x27;t oscillate between positive and negative infinitely often.

Wait, let me check with a concrete example. Suppose we have a biased random walk on the integers with p=2/3 and q=1/3 starting at 0. What is the probability that the walk ever reaches -1?

In general, for a biased random walk starting at 0, the probability of ever reaching -1 can be computed. Let me denote this probability as \( \rho \).

In the Gambler&#x27;s ruin problem, the probability of ruin starting from 0, with absorbing barriers at 0 and N, but here we have an absorbing barrier at -1 and the other at infinity. Wait, but actually, if we want the probability of ever reaching -1 starting from 0, with probability p=2/3 of moving right and q=1/3 of moving left, then the probability \( \rho \) satisfies the equation:

\( \rho = q + p \rho^2 \)

This is because starting from 0, with probability q=1/3, we go to -1 and are ruined, and with probability p=2/3, we go to +1, and then we need to reach -1 from +1, which is equivalent to the probability \( \rho^2 \) (since we have to go from +1 to 0 and then from 0 to -1, each with probability \( \rho \)).

Therefore, solving the equation \( \rho = 1/3 + (2/3) \rho^2 \).

Multiply both sides by 3: \( 3\rho = 1 + 2\rho^2 \), which becomes \( 2\rho^2 - 3\rho + 1 = 0 \).

Solving the quadratic equation: \( \rho = [3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}]/4 = [3 \pm 1]/4 \), so roots are 1 and 1/2.

Since we are looking for the probability of ruin, which is less than 1 (because the drift is positive), we take \( \rho = 1/2 \).

Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -1 is 1/2. Therefore, the probability that it ever reaches -k would be \( (1/2)^k \), as each subsequent level would require another independent ruin.

But in this case, the walk has a positive probability of eventually going to any negative level, but the probability of going to -k is \( (1/2)^k \), which is summable over k. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, since the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mathbb{P}( \text{reach } -k ) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (1/2)^k = 1 \), which converges. Wait, but Borel-Cantelli says that if the sum of probabilities is finite, then the probability that infinitely many of the events occur is 0. But here, the events are &quot;the walk reaches -k&quot;, but these are not independent events.

Wait, but actually, each time the walk reaches -k, it implies that it has reached -1, -2, ..., -k. So the events are nested. Therefore, the event that the walk reaches -k infinitely often is equivalent to the walk going to -infty. But since the probability of reaching -k is \( (1/2)^k \), the probability that it reaches -k for infinitely many k is the limit as k approaches infinity of \( (1/2)^k \), which is 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli lemma (the first one), since the sum of probabilities is finite, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty.

Alternatively, even if the walk has a positive drift, can it still have liminf -infty?

Wait, if the walk goes to +infty a.s., then the liminf is +infty. If the walk had oscillating behavior, like in the null recurrent case (symmetric walk), then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. But in our case, the walk is transient to +infty, so it cannot have liminf -infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the events \( A_k = \{ S_n \leq -k \text{ infinitely often} \} \). Then, \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is equivalent to \( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k \).

We need to compute \( \mathbb{P}( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k ) \).

By the continuity of probability measures, this is the limit as \( k \to \infty \) of \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

But \( A_{k+1} \subseteq A_k \), so the sequence \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \) is non-increasing.

Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

We know from the previous computation that \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \leq \mathbb{P}( \text{ever reaching } -k ) = (1/2)^k \).

But as \( k \to \infty \), \( (1/2)^k \to 0 \). Therefore, the probability \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \to 0 \). Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, another way is to note that since \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then for almost every sample path, there exists some integer \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq 0 \). Therefore, the liminf is at least 0. But actually, since \( S_n \to +\infty \), for any \( M &gt; 0 \), there exists \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is infinity.

Therefore, the probability that the liminf is -infty is 0.

So, after all this reasoning, I think the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a sequence \((X_{n})_{n \geq 1}\) of i.i.d. random variables where \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = -1) = \frac{1}{3}\) and \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = 1) = \frac{2}{3}\), we need to determine the value of \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty)\) for the random walk \(S_{n} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} X_{k}\) starting at \(S_{0} = 0\).

1. **Expectation and Drift**:
   - The expectation of each step \(X_n\) is \(\mathbb{E}[X_n] = \frac{1}{3}\). This positive drift indicates a tendency towards \(+\infty\).

2. **Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)**:
   - By the SLLN, \(\frac{S_n}{n} \to \frac{1}{3}\) almost surely. This implies \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely.

3. **Liminf Behavior**:
   - If \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, then for any large \(M\), there exists \(N\) such that for all \(n \geq N\), \(S_n \geq M\). Therefore, both \(\liminf S_n\) and \(\limsup S_n\) are \(+\infty\).

4. **Probability Analysis**:
   - The liminf of \(S_n\) being \(-\infty\) would require the walk to visit arbitrarily low levels infinitely often. However, due to the positive drift, the walk tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely, making such events impossible.
   - Using the Borel-Cantelli lemma, the probability of the walk reaching any negative level \(-k\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k\), which is summable. Hence, the probability of infinitely many such events is 0.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, the liminf of \(S_n\) is also \(+\infty\). Therefore, \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty) = 0\).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the liminf of the random walk \( S_n \) is \(-\infty\). The problem states that each \( X_n \) is an i.i.d. random variable with \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = 1) = \frac{2}{3} \). The process starts at \( S_0 = 0 \), and for each \( n \geq 1 \), \( S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n X_k \). The question is asking for \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \).

First, let me recall what liminf means. The liminf of a sequence \( S_n \) as \( n \to \infty \) is the smallest limit point of the sequence. In other words, it&#x27;s the infimum of all the limit points that the sequence approaches infinitely often. So if \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \), that means the sequence \( S_n \) goes arbitrarily low infinitely often. In the context of a random walk, this would imply that the walk recurrently visits every negative level, no matter how far down. 

But wait, in probability theory, when we talk about liminf and limsup of random walks, we often classify them as either transient or recurrent. A recurrent random walk returns to its starting point infinitely often with probability 1, whereas a transient random walk eventually leaves forever with probability 1. However, here we&#x27;re dealing with liminf behavior, which is a bit different. The question is about whether the walk goes to \(-\infty\) infinitely often, not necessarily returning to a specific point.

Given that the steps are i.i.d., each step has a drift. Let me compute the expected value of each step \( X_n \). The expectation is \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = (-1) \times \frac{1}{3} + 1 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{-1 + 2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \). So the drift is positive, which suggests that the walk has a tendency to drift towards \(+\infty\). But the question is about the liminf being \(-\infty\). Even if the walk drifts to \(+\infty\), it might still have liminf \(-\infty\) if it fluctuates enough downwards along the way. However, with a positive drift, maybe such fluctuations are not strong enough?

In one-dimensional random walks, there&#x27;s a concept of whether the walk is recurrent or transient. For symmetric simple random walks (like with equal probability to go left or right), the walk is recurrent in 1D and 2D, but transient in higher dimensions. However, in our case, the walk is not symmetric; it has a drift towards the right (positive direction). So perhaps it&#x27;s transient to the right, meaning that it tends to \(+\infty\) as \( n \to \infty \), but the liminf could still be \(-\infty\) or finite.

Wait, but the liminf is the infimum of the limit points. So even if the walk goes to \(+\infty\), but it fluctuates a lot, the liminf could be finite. For example, if the walk goes to \(+\infty\) but every once in a while comes back down to some finite level, the liminf would be that finite level. But if it can go arbitrarily low infinitely often, then the liminf is \(-\infty\).

So the key is to determine whether, with probability 1, the random walk \( S_n \) will reach any negative level infinitely often. If yes, then the liminf is \(-\infty\). If no, then the liminf is some finite value.

Given the walk has a positive drift, intuition says that it might be transient to \(+\infty\), but I need to check whether it is also &quot;downward transient&quot;, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t revisit negative values infinitely often.

Alternatively, perhaps there&#x27;s a theorem that relates the liminf behavior to the drift.

Alternatively, since each step has positive drift, by the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN), \( S_n / n \) converges almost surely to \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = 1/3 \). Therefore, \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely. Therefore, the liminf of \( S_n \) would be finite? Wait, if \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\), then both liminf and limsup should be \(+\infty\). But that contradicts the idea of liminf being the smallest limit point. Wait, no. If \( S_n \to +\infty \), then all limit points are \(+\infty\), so liminf is \(+\infty\). But in that case, how could liminf be \(-\infty\)?

Wait, maybe I&#x27;m confused. If the walk goes to \(+\infty\) almost surely, then with probability 1, for any large \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf would also be \(+\infty\). But that would suggest that \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

But wait, this contradicts the intuition that even with a positive drift, the walk might have fluctuations below zero. However, according to the SLLN, if the walk has a positive drift, then \( S_n \) tends to infinity almost surely, which would imply that the walk cannot go to \(-\infty\) in the liminf sense. But is that the case?

Wait, let me think again. The liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. Therefore, both liminf and limsup are infinity. Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \). But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the walk does not go to infinity almost surely? But with positive drift, I thought it does. Let me verify. For a random walk with i.i.d. steps with positive expectation, does \( S_n \to +\infty \) almost surely?

Yes, according to the SLLN, \( S_n / n \to 1/3 \) a.s., which implies that \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s. Therefore, almost every sample path goes to infinity. Therefore, for almost every path, for any \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is \(+\infty\), not \(-\infty\). So the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \) should be 0.

But wait, maybe the liminf is different? Let me check with a simple example. Suppose we have a deterministic sequence that tends to infinity. Then its liminf is infinity. If we have a sequence that has some fluctuations but still tends to infinity, then liminf is still infinity. For example, consider \( a_n = n + (-1)^n \). This sequence goes to infinity, and the liminf is infinity. So even with oscillations, if the overall trend is to infinity, liminf and limsup both are infinity.

Therefore, if \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability that \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is zero.

But wait, maybe there&#x27;s a nuance here. Let me recall that liminf is the infimum of the set of limit points. If the walk goes to infinity, then the set of limit points is just {+infty}, so the infimum is +infty. Therefore, the liminf is +infty. So indeed, the probability in question should be 0.

But then, why is the problem asking this? Maybe my reasoning is wrong. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the walk does not go to infinity almost surely. For example, even with positive drift, perhaps there&#x27;s a chance that the walk goes to -infty? But with positive drift, the expectation of the walk is linear in n with a positive slope, and by the SLLN, it converges to +infty. So maybe the walk cannot go to -infty.

Wait, but in some cases, even with positive drift, there can be a finite probability of the walk going to -infty. Wait, but in one dimension, if the walk is transient, it either goes to +infty or -infty. Wait, no. For asymmetric random walks on the integers, if the walk is transient, then it tends to +infty or -infty with certain probabilities. But in our case, the drift is positive, so the transience is towards +infty, but perhaps there is a 0 probability of drifting to -infty.

Wait, but the question is not about lim, but liminf. So even if the walk tends to +infty, it might have liminf -infty if it fluctuates enough. But if the walk is transient with drift to +infty, maybe those downward fluctuations are not strong enough to reach arbitrary low points infinitely often.

Alternatively, let me recall that for a random walk with positive drift, the probability that it ever reaches a negative level -k is less than 1, and actually decays exponentially with k. So, the probability that the walk ever goes below -k is something like \( (q/p)^k \), where p is the probability to go right, q to go left. In our case, p=2/3, q=1/3, so \( (q/p) = 1/2 \). Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -k is \( (1/2)^k \). Therefore, the probability that the walk goes below -k infinitely often is the probability that for infinitely many k, the walk reaches -k. But by Borel-Cantelli lemma, since the sum of probabilities \( \sum (1/2)^k \) converges, by Borel-Cantelli, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, liminf is finite.

Wait, but this contradicts the previous statement from the SLLN. Wait, but according to SLLN, the walk goes to infinity, so the liminf is infinity. But here, the argument is that the walk cannot go below arbitrary negative levels infinitely often. Therefore, the liminf is not -infty. So then, why does the liminf have to be infinity?

Wait, maybe the liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. So liminf is infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty is 0.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a difference between liminf being -infty and the walk going to -infty. If the walk goes to -infty, then liminf would be -infty. If the walk goes to +infty, liminf is +infty. But if the walk oscillates between -infty and +infty, then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. However, in our case, since the walk has positive drift, it goes to +infty almost surely, so liminf and limsup are both +infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Wait, but let me check again. Suppose we have a simple asymmetric random walk on integers with probability p to go right and q=1-p to go left. Then, if p &gt; q, the walk is transient to the right, meaning that it tends to +infty a.s. If p &lt; q, it tends to -infty a.s. If p = q, it&#x27;s recurrent.

In our case, p=2/3 &gt; q=1/3, so the walk is transient to +infty. Therefore, with probability 1, \( S_n \to +\infty \). Therefore, \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the liminf in another way. Even if the walk goes to +infty, maybe it can have liminf -infty if it has infinitely many drops to -infty. But if the walk tends to +infty, then after some finite time, it never goes below a certain level. Therefore, the liminf would be the infimum of the sequence from that point on, which is increasing to infinity, so liminf is infinity.

But perhaps the walk can go to +infty but still have liminf -infty? Wait, no. If the walk goes to +infty, then for any M, there exists N such that for all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= M. Therefore, the liminf is at least M. Since M can be as large as we want, liminf is infinity. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty in that case.

So then, the answer is 0.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. Suppose the walk is transient to the right. Then, with probability 1, S_n tends to +infty. Therefore, liminf S_n = +infty a.s. So indeed, the probability that liminf S_n = -infty is 0. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

In general, for a biased random walk starting at 0, the probability of ever reaching -1 can be computed. Let me denote this probability as \( \rho \).

In the Gambler&#x27;s ruin problem, the probability of ruin starting from 0, with absorbing barriers at 0 and N, but here we have an absorbing barrier at -1 and the other at infinity. Wait, but actually, if we want the probability of ever reaching -1 starting from 0, with probability p=2/3 of moving right and q=1/3 of moving left, then the probability \( \rho \) satisfies the equation:

\( \rho = q + p \rho^2 \)

This is because starting from 0, with probability q=1/3, we go to -1 and are ruined, and with probability p=2/3, we go to +1, and then we need to reach -1 from +1, which is equivalent to the probability \( \rho^2 \) (since we have to go from +1 to 0 and then from 0 to -1, each with probability \( \rho \)).

Therefore, solving the equation \( \rho = 1/3 + (2/3) \rho^2 \).

Multiply both sides by 3: \( 3\rho = 1 + 2\rho^2 \), which becomes \( 2\rho^2 - 3\rho + 1 = 0 \).

Solving the quadratic equation: \( \rho = [3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}]/4 = [3 \pm 1]/4 \), so roots are 1 and 1/2.

Since we are looking for the probability of ruin, which is less than 1 (because the drift is positive), we take \( \rho = 1/2 \).

Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -1 is 1/2. Therefore, the probability that it ever reaches -k would be \( (1/2)^k \), as each subsequent level would require another independent ruin.

But in this case, the walk has a positive probability of eventually going to any negative level, but the probability of going to -k is \( (1/2)^k \), which is summable over k. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, since the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mathbb{P}( \text{reach } -k ) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (1/2)^k = 1 \), which converges. Wait, but Borel-Cantelli says that if the sum of probabilities is finite, then the probability that infinitely many of the events occur is 0. But here, the events are &quot;the walk reaches -k&quot;, but these are not independent events.

Wait, but actually, each time the walk reaches -k, it implies that it has reached -1, -2, ..., -k. So the events are nested. Therefore, the event that the walk reaches -k infinitely often is equivalent to the walk going to -infty. But since the probability of reaching -k is \( (1/2)^k \), the probability that it reaches -k for infinitely many k is the limit as k approaches infinity of \( (1/2)^k \), which is 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli lemma (the first one), since the sum of probabilities is finite, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty.

Alternatively, even if the walk has a positive drift, can it still have liminf -infty?

Wait, if the walk goes to +infty a.s., then the liminf is +infty. If the walk had oscillating behavior, like in the null recurrent case (symmetric walk), then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. But in our case, the walk is transient to +infty, so it cannot have liminf -infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the events \( A_k = \{ S_n \leq -k \text{ infinitely often} \} \). Then, \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is equivalent to \( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k \).

We need to compute \( \mathbb{P}( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k ) \).

By the continuity of probability measures, this is the limit as \( k \to \infty \) of \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

But \( A_{k+1} \subseteq A_k \), so the sequence \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \) is non-increasing.

Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

We know from the previous computation that \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \leq \mathbb{P}( \text{ever reaching } -k ) = (1/2)^k \).

But as \( k \to \infty \), \( (1/2)^k \to 0 \). Therefore, the probability \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \to 0 \). Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, another way is to note that since \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then for almost every sample path, there exists some integer \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq 0 \). Therefore, the liminf is at least 0. But actually, since \( S_n \to +\infty \), for any \( M &gt; 0 \), there exists \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is infinity.

Therefore, the probability that the liminf is -infty is 0.

So, after all this reasoning, I think the answer is 0.

Given a sequence \((X_{n})_{n \geq 1}\) of i.i.d. random variables where \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = -1) = \frac{1}{3}\) and \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = 1) = \frac{2}{3}\), we need to determine the value of \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty)\) for the random walk \(S_{n} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} X_{k}\) starting at \(S_{0} = 0\).

1. **Expectation and Drift**:
   - The expectation of each step \(X_n\) is \(\mathbb{E}[X_n] = \frac{1}{3}\). This positive drift indicates a tendency towards \(+\infty\).

2. **Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)**:
   - By the SLLN, \(\frac{S_n}{n} \to \frac{1}{3}\) almost surely. This implies \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely.

3. **Liminf Behavior**:
   - If \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, then for any large \(M\), there exists \(N\) such that for all \(n \geq N\), \(S_n \geq M\). Therefore, both \(\liminf S_n\) and \(\limsup S_n\) are \(+\infty\).

4. **Probability Analysis**:
   - The liminf of \(S_n\) being \(-\infty\) would require the walk to visit arbitrarily low levels infinitely often. However, due to the positive drift, the walk tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely, making such events impossible.
   - Using the Borel-Cantelli lemma, the probability of the walk reaching any negative level \(-k\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k\), which is summable. Hence, the probability of infinitely many such events is 0.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, the liminf of \(S_n\) is also \(+\infty\). Therefore, \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty) = 0\).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the liminf of the random walk \( S_n \) is \(-\infty\). The problem states that each \( X_n \) is an i.i.d. random variable with \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = 1) = \frac{2}{3} \). The process starts at \( S_0 = 0 \), and for each \( n \geq 1 \), \( S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n X_k \). The question is asking for \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \).

First, let me recall what liminf means. The liminf of a sequence \( S_n \) as \( n \to \infty \) is the smallest limit point of the sequence. In other words, it&#x27;s the infimum of all the limit points that the sequence approaches infinitely often. So if \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \), that means the sequence \( S_n \) goes arbitrarily low infinitely often. In the context of a random walk, this would imply that the walk recurrently visits every negative level, no matter how far down. 

But wait, in probability theory, when we talk about liminf and limsup of random walks, we often classify them as either transient or recurrent. A recurrent random walk returns to its starting point infinitely often with probability 1, whereas a transient random walk eventually leaves forever with probability 1. However, here we&#x27;re dealing with liminf behavior, which is a bit different. The question is about whether the walk goes to \(-\infty\) infinitely often, not necessarily returning to a specific point.

Given that the steps are i.i.d., each step has a drift. Let me compute the expected value of each step \( X_n \). The expectation is \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = (-1) \times \frac{1}{3} + 1 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{-1 + 2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \). So the drift is positive, which suggests that the walk has a tendency to drift towards \(+\infty\). But the question is about the liminf being \(-\infty\). Even if the walk drifts to \(+\infty\), it might still have liminf \(-\infty\) if it fluctuates enough downwards along the way. However, with a positive drift, maybe such fluctuations are not strong enough?

In one-dimensional random walks, there&#x27;s a concept of whether the walk is recurrent or transient. For symmetric simple random walks (like with equal probability to go left or right), the walk is recurrent in 1D and 2D, but transient in higher dimensions. However, in our case, the walk is not symmetric; it has a drift towards the right (positive direction). So perhaps it&#x27;s transient to the right, meaning that it tends to \(+\infty\) as \( n \to \infty \), but the liminf could still be \(-\infty\) or finite.

Wait, but the liminf is the infimum of the limit points. So even if the walk goes to \(+\infty\), but it fluctuates a lot, the liminf could be finite. For example, if the walk goes to \(+\infty\) but every once in a while comes back down to some finite level, the liminf would be that finite level. But if it can go arbitrarily low infinitely often, then the liminf is \(-\infty\).

So the key is to determine whether, with probability 1, the random walk \( S_n \) will reach any negative level infinitely often. If yes, then the liminf is \(-\infty\). If no, then the liminf is some finite value.

Given the walk has a positive drift, intuition says that it might be transient to \(+\infty\), but I need to check whether it is also &quot;downward transient&quot;, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t revisit negative values infinitely often.

Alternatively, perhaps there&#x27;s a theorem that relates the liminf behavior to the drift.

Alternatively, since each step has positive drift, by the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN), \( S_n / n \) converges almost surely to \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = 1/3 \). Therefore, \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely. Therefore, the liminf of \( S_n \) would be finite? Wait, if \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\), then both liminf and limsup should be \(+\infty\). But that contradicts the idea of liminf being the smallest limit point. Wait, no. If \( S_n \to +\infty \), then all limit points are \(+\infty\), so liminf is \(+\infty\). But in that case, how could liminf be \(-\infty\)?

Wait, maybe I&#x27;m confused. If the walk goes to \(+\infty\) almost surely, then with probability 1, for any large \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf would also be \(+\infty\). But that would suggest that \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

But wait, this contradicts the intuition that even with a positive drift, the walk might have fluctuations below zero. However, according to the SLLN, if the walk has a positive drift, then \( S_n \) tends to infinity almost surely, which would imply that the walk cannot go to \(-\infty\) in the liminf sense. But is that the case?

Wait, let me think again. The liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. Therefore, both liminf and limsup are infinity. Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \). But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the walk does not go to infinity almost surely? But with positive drift, I thought it does. Let me verify. For a random walk with i.i.d. steps with positive expectation, does \( S_n \to +\infty \) almost surely?

Yes, according to the SLLN, \( S_n / n \to 1/3 \) a.s., which implies that \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s. Therefore, almost every sample path goes to infinity. Therefore, for almost every path, for any \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is \(+\infty\), not \(-\infty\). So the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \) should be 0.

But wait, maybe the liminf is different? Let me check with a simple example. Suppose we have a deterministic sequence that tends to infinity. Then its liminf is infinity. If we have a sequence that has some fluctuations but still tends to infinity, then liminf is still infinity. For example, consider \( a_n = n + (-1)^n \). This sequence goes to infinity, and the liminf is infinity. So even with oscillations, if the overall trend is to infinity, liminf and limsup both are infinity.

Therefore, if \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability that \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is zero.

But wait, maybe there&#x27;s a nuance here. Let me recall that liminf is the infimum of the set of limit points. If the walk goes to infinity, then the set of limit points is just {+infty}, so the infimum is +infty. Therefore, the liminf is +infty. So indeed, the probability in question should be 0.

But then, why is the problem asking this? Maybe my reasoning is wrong. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the walk does not go to infinity almost surely. For example, even with positive drift, perhaps there&#x27;s a chance that the walk goes to -infty? But with positive drift, the expectation of the walk is linear in n with a positive slope, and by the SLLN, it converges to +infty. So maybe the walk cannot go to -infty.

Wait, but in some cases, even with positive drift, there can be a finite probability of the walk going to -infty. Wait, but in one dimension, if the walk is transient, it either goes to +infty or -infty. Wait, no. For asymmetric random walks on the integers, if the walk is transient, then it tends to +infty or -infty with certain probabilities. But in our case, the drift is positive, so the transience is towards +infty, but perhaps there is a 0 probability of drifting to -infty.

Wait, but the question is not about lim, but liminf. So even if the walk tends to +infty, it might have liminf -infty if it fluctuates enough. But if the walk is transient with drift to +infty, maybe those downward fluctuations are not strong enough to reach arbitrary low points infinitely often.

Alternatively, let me recall that for a random walk with positive drift, the probability that it ever reaches a negative level -k is less than 1, and actually decays exponentially with k. So, the probability that the walk ever goes below -k is something like \( (q/p)^k \), where p is the probability to go right, q to go left. In our case, p=2/3, q=1/3, so \( (q/p) = 1/2 \). Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -k is \( (1/2)^k \). Therefore, the probability that the walk goes below -k infinitely often is the probability that for infinitely many k, the walk reaches -k. But by Borel-Cantelli lemma, since the sum of probabilities \( \sum (1/2)^k \) converges, by Borel-Cantelli, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, liminf is finite.

Wait, but this contradicts the previous statement from the SLLN. Wait, but according to SLLN, the walk goes to infinity, so the liminf is infinity. But here, the argument is that the walk cannot go below arbitrary negative levels infinitely often. Therefore, the liminf is not -infty. So then, why does the liminf have to be infinity?

Wait, maybe the liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. So liminf is infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty is 0.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a difference between liminf being -infty and the walk going to -infty. If the walk goes to -infty, then liminf would be -infty. If the walk goes to +infty, liminf is +infty. But if the walk oscillates between -infty and +infty, then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. However, in our case, since the walk has positive drift, it goes to +infty almost surely, so liminf and limsup are both +infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Wait, but let me check again. Suppose we have a simple asymmetric random walk on integers with probability p to go right and q=1-p to go left. Then, if p &gt; q, the walk is transient to the right, meaning that it tends to +infty a.s. If p &lt; q, it tends to -infty a.s. If p = q, it&#x27;s recurrent.

In our case, p=2/3 &gt; q=1/3, so the walk is transient to +infty. Therefore, with probability 1, \( S_n \to +\infty \). Therefore, \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the liminf in another way. Even if the walk goes to +infty, maybe it can have liminf -infty if it has infinitely many drops to -infty. But if the walk tends to +infty, then after some finite time, it never goes below a certain level. Therefore, the liminf would be the infimum of the sequence from that point on, which is increasing to infinity, so liminf is infinity.

But perhaps the walk can go to +infty but still have liminf -infty? Wait, no. If the walk goes to +infty, then for any M, there exists N such that for all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= M. Therefore, the liminf is at least M. Since M can be as large as we want, liminf is infinity. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty in that case.

So then, the answer is 0.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. Suppose the walk is transient to the right. Then, with probability 1, S_n tends to +infty. Therefore, liminf S_n = +infty a.s. So indeed, the probability that liminf S_n = -infty is 0. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me? Let me consider another angle.

Suppose that even though the walk tends to +infty, maybe there are infinitely many times when it goes below 0. But even if that&#x27;s the case, the liminf would be the infimum of those points. If the walk goes below 0 infinitely often, but the extent to which it goes below 0 is bounded, then liminf would be some finite negative number. However, if it can go below any negative integer infinitely often, then the liminf would be -infty.

But in our case, with positive drift, is it possible that the walk visits 0 infinitely often? If it&#x27;s transient to the right, then it can only visit 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is also finite.

Wait, but transience to the right means that the walk eventually stays on the right side, right? So, for some N, all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= 0. But is that the case?

Wait, actually, transience to the right means that the walk tends to +infty, but it might revisit the left side (negative numbers) infinitely often. Wait, but if the walk has a positive drift, can it still go below 0 infinitely often?

Hmm, this is a key point. Let me recall that in one dimension, for an asymmetric random walk with drift, whether it is transient or not is determined by the direction of the drift. If the drift is positive, then the walk tends to +infty a.s. But does that mean that it can&#x27;t go below 0 infinitely often?

No, actually, even with a positive drift, the walk might still cross below 0 infinitely often. For example, consider the case where the walk has a small positive drift. Then, there&#x27;s a positive probability that it will cross below 0 infinitely often. Wait, but actually, in the case of asymmetric random walks on integers, starting at 0, with p &gt; q, the walk is transient to +infty, which means that it visits each state finitely many times. Therefore, it can only cross 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is finite.

Wait, this is a crucial point. Let me recall that in a transient random walk to the right, the number of times the walk returns to the origin is finite. Therefore, the walk can only cross below 0 finitely many times. Therefore, after some finite time, the walk remains positive. Therefore, the liminf would be the minimum value achieved by the walk after that finite time, which is positive, and since the walk tends to infinity, the liminf would be infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty would be 0.

Alternatively, maybe in higher dimensions, but in 1D, once the walk is transient, it can&#x27;t oscillate between positive and negative infinitely often.

Wait, let me check with a concrete example. Suppose we have a biased random walk on the integers with p=2/3 and q=1/3 starting at 0. What is the probability that the walk ever reaches -1?

In general, for a biased random walk starting at 0, the probability of ever reaching -1 can be computed. Let me denote this probability as \( \rho \).

In the Gambler&#x27;s ruin problem, the probability of ruin starting from 0, with absorbing barriers at 0 and N, but here we have an absorbing barrier at -1 and the other at infinity. Wait, but actually, if we want the probability of ever reaching -1 starting from 0, with probability p=2/3 of moving right and q=1/3 of moving left, then the probability \( \rho \) satisfies the equation:

\( \rho = q + p \rho^2 \)

This is because starting from 0, with probability q=1/3, we go to -1 and are ruined, and with probability p=2/3, we go to +1, and then we need to reach -1 from +1, which is equivalent to the probability \( \rho^2 \) (since we have to go from +1 to 0 and then from 0 to -1, each with probability \( \rho \)).

Therefore, solving the equation \( \rho = 1/3 + (2/3) \rho^2 \).

Multiply both sides by 3: \( 3\rho = 1 + 2\rho^2 \), which becomes \( 2\rho^2 - 3\rho + 1 = 0 \).

Solving the quadratic equation: \( \rho = [3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}]/4 = [3 \pm 1]/4 \), so roots are 1 and 1/2.

Since we are looking for the probability of ruin, which is less than 1 (because the drift is positive), we take \( \rho = 1/2 \).

Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -1 is 1/2. Therefore, the probability that it ever reaches -k would be \( (1/2)^k \), as each subsequent level would require another independent ruin.

But in this case, the walk has a positive probability of eventually going to any negative level, but the probability of going to -k is \( (1/2)^k \), which is summable over k. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, since the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mathbb{P}( \text{reach } -k ) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (1/2)^k = 1 \), which converges. Wait, but Borel-Cantelli says that if the sum of probabilities is finite, then the probability that infinitely many of the events occur is 0. But here, the events are &quot;the walk reaches -k&quot;, but these are not independent events.

Wait, but actually, each time the walk reaches -k, it implies that it has reached -1, -2, ..., -k. So the events are nested. Therefore, the event that the walk reaches -k infinitely often is equivalent to the walk going to -infty. But since the probability of reaching -k is \( (1/2)^k \), the probability that it reaches -k for infinitely many k is the limit as k approaches infinity of \( (1/2)^k \), which is 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli lemma (the first one), since the sum of probabilities is finite, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty.

Alternatively, even if the walk has a positive drift, can it still have liminf -infty?

Wait, if the walk goes to +infty a.s., then the liminf is +infty. If the walk had oscillating behavior, like in the null recurrent case (symmetric walk), then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. But in our case, the walk is transient to +infty, so it cannot have liminf -infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the events \( A_k = \{ S_n \leq -k \text{ infinitely often} \} \). Then, \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is equivalent to \( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k \).

We need to compute \( \mathbb{P}( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k ) \).

By the continuity of probability measures, this is the limit as \( k \to \infty \) of \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

But \( A_{k+1} \subseteq A_k \), so the sequence \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \) is non-increasing.

Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

We know from the previous computation that \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \leq \mathbb{P}( \text{ever reaching } -k ) = (1/2)^k \).

But as \( k \to \infty \), \( (1/2)^k \to 0 \). Therefore, the probability \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \to 0 \). Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, another way is to note that since \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then for almost every sample path, there exists some integer \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq 0 \). Therefore, the liminf is at least 0. But actually, since \( S_n \to +\infty \), for any \( M &gt; 0 \), there exists \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is infinity.

Therefore, the probability that the liminf is -infty is 0.

So, after all this reasoning, I think the answer is 0.

Given a sequence \((X_{n})_{n \geq 1}\) of i.i.d. random variables where \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = -1) = \frac{1}{3}\) and \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = 1) = \frac{2}{3}\), we need to determine the value of \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty)\) for the random walk \(S_{n} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} X_{k}\) starting at \(S_{0} = 0\).

1. **Expectation and Drift**:
   - The expectation of each step \(X_n\) is \(\mathbb{E}[X_n] = \frac{1}{3}\). This positive drift indicates a tendency towards \(+\infty\).

2. **Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)**:
   - By the SLLN, \(\frac{S_n}{n} \to \frac{1}{3}\) almost surely. This implies \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely.

3. **Liminf Behavior**:
   - If \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, then for any large \(M\), there exists \(N\) such that for all \(n \geq N\), \(S_n \geq M\). Therefore, both \(\liminf S_n\) and \(\limsup S_n\) are \(+\infty\).

4. **Probability Analysis**:
   - The liminf of \(S_n\) being \(-\infty\) would require the walk to visit arbitrarily low levels infinitely often. However, due to the positive drift, the walk tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely, making such events impossible.
   - Using the Borel-Cantelli lemma, the probability of the walk reaching any negative level \(-k\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k\), which is summable. Hence, the probability of infinitely many such events is 0.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, the liminf of \(S_n\) is also \(+\infty\). Therefore, \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty) = 0\).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the liminf of the random walk \( S_n \) is \(-\infty\). The problem states that each \( X_n \) is an i.i.d. random variable with \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = 1) = \frac{2}{3} \). The process starts at \( S_0 = 0 \), and for each \( n \geq 1 \), \( S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n X_k \). The question is asking for \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \).

First, let me recall what liminf means. The liminf of a sequence \( S_n \) as \( n \to \infty \) is the smallest limit point of the sequence. In other words, it&#x27;s the infimum of all the limit points that the sequence approaches infinitely often. So if \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \), that means the sequence \( S_n \) goes arbitrarily low infinitely often. In the context of a random walk, this would imply that the walk recurrently visits every negative level, no matter how far down. 

But wait, in probability theory, when we talk about liminf and limsup of random walks, we often classify them as either transient or recurrent. A recurrent random walk returns to its starting point infinitely often with probability 1, whereas a transient random walk eventually leaves forever with probability 1. However, here we&#x27;re dealing with liminf behavior, which is a bit different. The question is about whether the walk goes to \(-\infty\) infinitely often, not necessarily returning to a specific point.

Given that the steps are i.i.d., each step has a drift. Let me compute the expected value of each step \( X_n \). The expectation is \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = (-1) \times \frac{1}{3} + 1 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{-1 + 2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \). So the drift is positive, which suggests that the walk has a tendency to drift towards \(+\infty\). But the question is about the liminf being \(-\infty\). Even if the walk drifts to \(+\infty\), it might still have liminf \(-\infty\) if it fluctuates enough downwards along the way. However, with a positive drift, maybe such fluctuations are not strong enough?

In one-dimensional random walks, there&#x27;s a concept of whether the walk is recurrent or transient. For symmetric simple random walks (like with equal probability to go left or right), the walk is recurrent in 1D and 2D, but transient in higher dimensions. However, in our case, the walk is not symmetric; it has a drift towards the right (positive direction). So perhaps it&#x27;s transient to the right, meaning that it tends to \(+\infty\) as \( n \to \infty \), but the liminf could still be \(-\infty\) or finite.

Wait, but the liminf is the infimum of the limit points. So even if the walk goes to \(+\infty\), but it fluctuates a lot, the liminf could be finite. For example, if the walk goes to \(+\infty\) but every once in a while comes back down to some finite level, the liminf would be that finite level. But if it can go arbitrarily low infinitely often, then the liminf is \(-\infty\).

So the key is to determine whether, with probability 1, the random walk \( S_n \) will reach any negative level infinitely often. If yes, then the liminf is \(-\infty\). If no, then the liminf is some finite value.

Given the walk has a positive drift, intuition says that it might be transient to \(+\infty\), but I need to check whether it is also &quot;downward transient&quot;, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t revisit negative values infinitely often.

Alternatively, perhaps there&#x27;s a theorem that relates the liminf behavior to the drift.

Alternatively, since each step has positive drift, by the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN), \( S_n / n \) converges almost surely to \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = 1/3 \). Therefore, \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely. Therefore, the liminf of \( S_n \) would be finite? Wait, if \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\), then both liminf and limsup should be \(+\infty\). But that contradicts the idea of liminf being the smallest limit point. Wait, no. If \( S_n \to +\infty \), then all limit points are \(+\infty\), so liminf is \(+\infty\). But in that case, how could liminf be \(-\infty\)?

Wait, maybe I&#x27;m confused. If the walk goes to \(+\infty\) almost surely, then with probability 1, for any large \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf would also be \(+\infty\). But that would suggest that \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

But wait, this contradicts the intuition that even with a positive drift, the walk might have fluctuations below zero. However, according to the SLLN, if the walk has a positive drift, then \( S_n \) tends to infinity almost surely, which would imply that the walk cannot go to \(-\infty\) in the liminf sense. But is that the case?

Wait, let me think again. The liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. Therefore, both liminf and limsup are infinity. Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \). But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the walk does not go to infinity almost surely? But with positive drift, I thought it does. Let me verify. For a random walk with i.i.d. steps with positive expectation, does \( S_n \to +\infty \) almost surely?

Yes, according to the SLLN, \( S_n / n \to 1/3 \) a.s., which implies that \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s. Therefore, almost every sample path goes to infinity. Therefore, for almost every path, for any \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is \(+\infty\), not \(-\infty\). So the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \) should be 0.

But wait, maybe the liminf is different? Let me check with a simple example. Suppose we have a deterministic sequence that tends to infinity. Then its liminf is infinity. If we have a sequence that has some fluctuations but still tends to infinity, then liminf is still infinity. For example, consider \( a_n = n + (-1)^n \). This sequence goes to infinity, and the liminf is infinity. So even with oscillations, if the overall trend is to infinity, liminf and limsup both are infinity.

Therefore, if \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability that \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is zero.

But wait, maybe there&#x27;s a nuance here. Let me recall that liminf is the infimum of the set of limit points. If the walk goes to infinity, then the set of limit points is just {+infty}, so the infimum is +infty. Therefore, the liminf is +infty. So indeed, the probability in question should be 0.

But then, why is the problem asking this? Maybe my reasoning is wrong. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the walk does not go to infinity almost surely. For example, even with positive drift, perhaps there&#x27;s a chance that the walk goes to -infty? But with positive drift, the expectation of the walk is linear in n with a positive slope, and by the SLLN, it converges to +infty. So maybe the walk cannot go to -infty.

Wait, but in some cases, even with positive drift, there can be a finite probability of the walk going to -infty. Wait, but in one dimension, if the walk is transient, it either goes to +infty or -infty. Wait, no. For asymmetric random walks on the integers, if the walk is transient, then it tends to +infty or -infty with certain probabilities. But in our case, the drift is positive, so the transience is towards +infty, but perhaps there is a 0 probability of drifting to -infty.

Wait, but the question is not about lim, but liminf. So even if the walk tends to +infty, it might have liminf -infty if it fluctuates enough. But if the walk is transient with drift to +infty, maybe those downward fluctuations are not strong enough to reach arbitrary low points infinitely often.

Alternatively, let me recall that for a random walk with positive drift, the probability that it ever reaches a negative level -k is less than 1, and actually decays exponentially with k. So, the probability that the walk ever goes below -k is something like \( (q/p)^k \), where p is the probability to go right, q to go left. In our case, p=2/3, q=1/3, so \( (q/p) = 1/2 \). Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -k is \( (1/2)^k \). Therefore, the probability that the walk goes below -k infinitely often is the probability that for infinitely many k, the walk reaches -k. But by Borel-Cantelli lemma, since the sum of probabilities \( \sum (1/2)^k \) converges, by Borel-Cantelli, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, liminf is finite.

Wait, but this contradicts the previous statement from the SLLN. Wait, but according to SLLN, the walk goes to infinity, so the liminf is infinity. But here, the argument is that the walk cannot go below arbitrary negative levels infinitely often. Therefore, the liminf is not -infty. So then, why does the liminf have to be infinity?

Wait, maybe the liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. So liminf is infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty is 0.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a difference between liminf being -infty and the walk going to -infty. If the walk goes to -infty, then liminf would be -infty. If the walk goes to +infty, liminf is +infty. But if the walk oscillates between -infty and +infty, then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. However, in our case, since the walk has positive drift, it goes to +infty almost surely, so liminf and limsup are both +infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Wait, but let me check again. Suppose we have a simple asymmetric random walk on integers with probability p to go right and q=1-p to go left. Then, if p &gt; q, the walk is transient to the right, meaning that it tends to +infty a.s. If p &lt; q, it tends to -infty a.s. If p = q, it&#x27;s recurrent.

In our case, p=2/3 &gt; q=1/3, so the walk is transient to +infty. Therefore, with probability 1, \( S_n \to +\infty \). Therefore, \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the liminf in another way. Even if the walk goes to +infty, maybe it can have liminf -infty if it has infinitely many drops to -infty. But if the walk tends to +infty, then after some finite time, it never goes below a certain level. Therefore, the liminf would be the infimum of the sequence from that point on, which is increasing to infinity, so liminf is infinity.

But perhaps the walk can go to +infty but still have liminf -infty? Wait, no. If the walk goes to +infty, then for any M, there exists N such that for all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= M. Therefore, the liminf is at least M. Since M can be as large as we want, liminf is infinity. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty in that case.

So then, the answer is 0.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. Suppose the walk is transient to the right. Then, with probability 1, S_n tends to +infty. Therefore, liminf S_n = +infty a.s. So indeed, the probability that liminf S_n = -infty is 0. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me? Let me consider another angle.

Suppose that even though the walk tends to +infty, maybe there are infinitely many times when it goes below 0. But even if that&#x27;s the case, the liminf would be the infimum of those points. If the walk goes below 0 infinitely often, but the extent to which it goes below 0 is bounded, then liminf would be some finite negative number. However, if it can go below any negative integer infinitely often, then the liminf would be -infty.

But in our case, with positive drift, is it possible that the walk visits 0 infinitely often? If it&#x27;s transient to the right, then it can only visit 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is also finite.

Wait, but transience to the right means that the walk eventually stays on the right side, right? So, for some N, all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= 0. But is that the case?

Wait, actually, transience to the right means that the walk tends to +infty, but it might revisit the left side (negative numbers) infinitely often. Wait, but if the walk has a positive drift, can it still go below 0 infinitely often?

Hmm, this is a key point. Let me recall that in one dimension, for an asymmetric random walk with drift, whether it is transient or not is determined by the direction of the drift. If the drift is positive, then the walk tends to +infty a.s. But does that mean that it can&#x27;t go below 0 infinitely often?

No, actually, even with a positive drift, the walk might still cross below 0 infinitely often. For example, consider the case where the walk has a small positive drift. Then, there&#x27;s a positive probability that it will cross below 0 infinitely often. Wait, but actually, in the case of asymmetric random walks on integers, starting at 0, with p &gt; q, the walk is transient to +infty, which means that it visits each state finitely many times. Therefore, it can only cross 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is finite.

Wait, this is a crucial point. Let me recall that in a transient random walk to the right, the number of times the walk returns to the origin is finite. Therefore, the walk can only cross below 0 finitely many times. Therefore, after some finite time, the walk remains positive. Therefore, the liminf would be the minimum value achieved by the walk after that finite time, which is positive, and since the walk tends to infinity, the liminf would be infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty would be 0.

Alternatively, maybe in higher dimensions, but in 1D, once the walk is transient, it can&#x27;t oscillate between positive and negative infinitely often.

Wait, let me check with a concrete example. Suppose we have a biased random walk on the integers with p=2/3 and q=1/3 starting at 0. What is the probability that the walk ever reaches -1?

In general, for a biased random walk starting at 0, the probability of ever reaching -1 can be computed. Let me denote this probability as \( \rho \).

In the Gambler&#x27;s ruin problem, the probability of ruin starting from 0, with absorbing barriers at 0 and N, but here we have an absorbing barrier at -1 and the other at infinity. Wait, but actually, if we want the probability of ever reaching -1 starting from 0, with probability p=2/3 of moving right and q=1/3 of moving left, then the probability \( \rho \) satisfies the equation:

\( \rho = q + p \rho^2 \)

This is because starting from 0, with probability q=1/3, we go to -1 and are ruined, and with probability p=2/3, we go to +1, and then we need to reach -1 from +1, which is equivalent to the probability \( \rho^2 \) (since we have to go from +1 to 0 and then from 0 to -1, each with probability \( \rho \)).

Therefore, solving the equation \( \rho = 1/3 + (2/3) \rho^2 \).

Multiply both sides by 3: \( 3\rho = 1 + 2\rho^2 \), which becomes \( 2\rho^2 - 3\rho + 1 = 0 \).

Solving the quadratic equation: \( \rho = [3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}]/4 = [3 \pm 1]/4 \), so roots are 1 and 1/2.

Since we are looking for the probability of ruin, which is less than 1 (because the drift is positive), we take \( \rho = 1/2 \).

Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -1 is 1/2. Therefore, the probability that it ever reaches -k would be \( (1/2)^k \), as each subsequent level would require another independent ruin.

But in this case, the walk has a positive probability of eventually going to any negative level, but the probability of going to -k is \( (1/2)^k \), which is summable over k. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, since the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mathbb{P}( \text{reach } -k ) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (1/2)^k = 1 \), which converges. Wait, but Borel-Cantelli says that if the sum of probabilities is finite, then the probability that infinitely many of the events occur is 0. But here, the events are &quot;the walk reaches -k&quot;, but these are not independent events.

Wait, but actually, each time the walk reaches -k, it implies that it has reached -1, -2, ..., -k. So the events are nested. Therefore, the event that the walk reaches -k infinitely often is equivalent to the walk going to -infty. But since the probability of reaching -k is \( (1/2)^k \), the probability that it reaches -k for infinitely many k is the limit as k approaches infinity of \( (1/2)^k \), which is 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli lemma (the first one), since the sum of probabilities is finite, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty.

Alternatively, even if the walk has a positive drift, can it still have liminf -infty?

Wait, if the walk goes to +infty a.s., then the liminf is +infty. If the walk had oscillating behavior, like in the null recurrent case (symmetric walk), then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. But in our case, the walk is transient to +infty, so it cannot have liminf -infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the events \( A_k = \{ S_n \leq -k \text{ infinitely often} \} \). Then, \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is equivalent to \( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k \).

We need to compute \( \mathbb{P}( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k ) \).

By the continuity of probability measures, this is the limit as \( k \to \infty \) of \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

But \( A_{k+1} \subseteq A_k \), so the sequence \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \) is non-increasing.

Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

We know from the previous computation that \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \leq \mathbb{P}( \text{ever reaching } -k ) = (1/2)^k \).

But as \( k \to \infty \), \( (1/2)^k \to 0 \). Therefore, the probability \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \to 0 \). Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, another way is to note that since \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then for almost every sample path, there exists some integer \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq 0 \). Therefore, the liminf is at least 0. But actually, since \( S_n \to +\infty \), for any \( M &gt; 0 \), there exists \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is infinity.

Therefore, the probability that the liminf is -infty is 0.

So, after all this reasoning, I think the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a sequence \((X_{n})_{n \geq 1}\) of i.i.d. random variables where \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = -1) = \frac{1}{3}\) and \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = 1) = \frac{2}{3}\), we need to determine the value of \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty)\) for the random walk \(S_{n} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} X_{k}\) starting at \(S_{0} = 0\).

1. **Expectation and Drift**:
   - The expectation of each step \(X_n\) is \(\mathbb{E}[X_n] = \frac{1}{3}\). This positive drift indicates a tendency towards \(+\infty\).

2. **Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)**:
   - By the SLLN, \(\frac{S_n}{n} \to \frac{1}{3}\) almost surely. This implies \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely.

3. **Liminf Behavior**:
   - If \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, then for any large \(M\), there exists \(N\) such that for all \(n \geq N\), \(S_n \geq M\). Therefore, both \(\liminf S_n\) and \(\limsup S_n\) are \(+\infty\).

4. **Probability Analysis**:
   - The liminf of \(S_n\) being \(-\infty\) would require the walk to visit arbitrarily low levels infinitely often. However, due to the positive drift, the walk tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely, making such events impossible.
   - Using the Borel-Cantelli lemma, the probability of the walk reaching any negative level \(-k\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k\), which is summable. Hence, the probability of infinitely many such events is 0.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, the liminf of \(S_n\) is also \(+\infty\). Therefore, \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty) = 0\).

So the drift is positive, which suggests that the walk has a tendency to drift towards \(+\infty\). But the question is about the liminf being \(-\infty\). Even if the walk drifts to \(+\infty\), it might still have liminf \(-\infty\) if it fluctuates enough downwards along the way. However, with a positive drift, maybe such fluctuations are not strong enough?

In one-dimensional random walks, there&#x27;s a concept of whether the walk is recurrent or transient.

But wait, this contradicts the intuition that even with a positive drift, the walk might have fluctuations below zero. However, according to the SLLN, if the walk has a positive drift, then \( S_n \) tends to infinity almost surely, which would imply that the walk cannot go to \(-\infty\) in the liminf sense. But is that the case?

Wait, let me think again. The liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. Therefore, both liminf and limsup are infinity. Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \). But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the walk does not go to infinity almost surely? But with positive drift, I thought it does. Let me verify. For a random walk with i.i.d. steps with positive expectation, does \( S_n \to +\infty \) almost surely?

Yes, according to the SLLN, \( S_n / n \to 1/3 \) a.s., which implies that \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s. Therefore, almost every sample path goes to infinity. Therefore, for almost every path, for any \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is \(+\infty\), not \(-\infty\). So the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \) should be 0.

But wait, maybe the liminf is different? Let me check with a simple example. Suppose we have a deterministic sequence that tends to infinity. Then its liminf is infinity. If we have a sequence that has some fluctuations but still tends to infinity, then liminf is still infinity. For example, consider \( a_n = n + (-1)^n \). This sequence goes to infinity, and the liminf is infinity. So even with oscillations, if the overall trend is to infinity, liminf and limsup both are infinity.

Therefore, if \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability that \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is zero.

But wait, maybe there&#x27;s a nuance here. Let me recall that liminf is the infimum of the set of limit points. If the walk goes to infinity, then the set of limit points is just {+infty}, so the infimum is +infty. Therefore, the liminf is +infty. So indeed, the probability in question should be 0.

But then, why is the problem asking this? Maybe my reasoning is wrong. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the walk does not go to infinity almost surely. For example, even with positive drift, perhaps there&#x27;s a chance that the walk goes to -infty? But with positive drift, the expectation of the walk is linear in n with a positive slope, and by the SLLN, it converges to +infty. So maybe the walk cannot go to -infty.

Wait, but in some cases, even with positive drift, there can be a finite probability of the walk going to -infty. Wait, but in one dimension, if the walk is transient, it either goes to +infty or -infty. Wait, no. For asymmetric random walks on the integers, if the walk is transient, then it tends to +infty or -infty with certain probabilities. But in our case, the drift is positive, so the transience is towards +infty, but perhaps there is a 0 probability of drifting to -infty.

Wait, but the question is not about lim, but liminf. So even if the walk tends to +infty, it might have liminf -infty if it fluctuates enough. But if the walk is transient with drift to +infty, maybe those downward fluctuations are not strong enough to reach arbitrary low points infinitely often.

Alternatively, let me recall that for a random walk with positive drift, the probability that it ever reaches a negative level -k is less than 1, and actually decays exponentially with k. So, the probability that the walk ever goes below -k is something like \( (q/p)^k \), where p is the probability to go right, q to go left. In our case, p=2/3, q=1/3, so \( (q/p) = 1/2 \). Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -k is \( (1/2)^k \). Therefore, the probability that the walk goes below -k infinitely often is the probability that for infinitely many k, the walk reaches -k. But by Borel-Cantelli lemma, since the sum of probabilities \( \sum (1/2)^k \) converges, by Borel-Cantelli, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, liminf is finite.

Wait, but this contradicts the previous statement from the SLLN. Wait, but according to SLLN, the walk goes to infinity, so the liminf is infinity. But here, the argument is that the walk cannot go below arbitrary negative levels infinitely often. Therefore, the liminf is not -infty. So then, why does the liminf have to be infinity?

Wait, maybe the liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. So liminf is infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty is 0.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a difference between liminf being -infty and the walk going to -infty. If the walk goes to -infty, then liminf would be -infty. If the walk goes to +infty, liminf is +infty. But if the walk oscillates between -infty and +infty, then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. However, in our case, since the walk has positive drift, it goes to +infty almost surely, so liminf and limsup are both +infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Wait, but let me check again. Suppose we have a simple asymmetric random walk on integers with probability p to go right and q=1-p to go left. Then, if p &gt; q, the walk is transient to the right, meaning that it tends to +infty a.s. If p &lt; q, it tends to -infty a.s. If p = q, it&#x27;s recurrent.

In our case, p=2/3 &gt; q=1/3, so the walk is transient to +infty. Therefore, with probability 1, \( S_n \to +\infty \). Therefore, \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the liminf in another way. Even if the walk goes to +infty, maybe it can have liminf -infty if it has infinitely many drops to -infty. But if the walk tends to +infty, then after some finite time, it never goes below a certain level. Therefore, the liminf would be the infimum of the sequence from that point on, which is increasing to infinity, so liminf is infinity.

But perhaps the walk can go to +infty but still have liminf -infty? Wait, no. If the walk goes to +infty, then for any M, there exists N such that for all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= M. Therefore, the liminf is at least M. Since M can be as large as we want, liminf is infinity. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty in that case.

So then, the answer is 0.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. Suppose the walk is transient to the right. Then, with probability 1, S_n tends to +infty. Therefore, liminf S_n = +infty a.s. So indeed, the probability that liminf S_n = -infty is 0. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me? Let me consider another angle.

Suppose that even though the walk tends to +infty, maybe there are infinitely many times when it goes below 0. But even if that&#x27;s the case, the liminf would be the infimum of those points. If the walk goes below 0 infinitely often, but the extent to which it goes below 0 is bounded, then liminf would be some finite negative number. However, if it can go below any negative integer infinitely often, then the liminf would be -infty.

But in our case, with positive drift, is it possible that the walk visits 0 infinitely often? If it&#x27;s transient to the right, then it can only visit 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is also finite.

Wait, but transience to the right means that the walk eventually stays on the right side, right? So, for some N, all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= 0. But is that the case?

Wait, actually, transience to the right means that the walk tends to +infty, but it might revisit the left side (negative numbers) infinitely often. Wait, but if the walk has a positive drift, can it still go below 0 infinitely often?

Hmm, this is a key point. Let me recall that in one dimension, for an asymmetric random walk with drift, whether it is transient or not is determined by the direction of the drift. If the drift is positive, then the walk tends to +infty a.s. But does that mean that it can&#x27;t go below 0 infinitely often?

No, actually, even with a positive drift, the walk might still cross below 0 infinitely often. For example, consider the case where the walk has a small positive drift. Then, there&#x27;s a positive probability that it will cross below 0 infinitely often. Wait, but actually, in the case of asymmetric random walks on integers, starting at 0, with p &gt; q, the walk is transient to +infty, which means that it visits each state finitely many times. Therefore, it can only cross 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is finite.

Wait, this is a crucial point. Let me recall that in a transient random walk to the right, the number of times the walk returns to the origin is finite. Therefore, the walk can only cross below 0 finitely many times. Therefore, after some finite time, the walk remains positive. Therefore, the liminf would be the minimum value achieved by the walk after that finite time, which is positive, and since the walk tends to infinity, the liminf would be infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty would be 0.

Alternatively, maybe in higher dimensions, but in 1D, once the walk is transient, it can&#x27;t oscillate between positive and negative infinitely often.

Wait, let me check with a concrete example. Suppose we have a biased random walk on the integers with p=2/3 and q=1/3 starting at 0. What is the probability that the walk ever reaches -1?

In general, for a biased random walk starting at 0, the probability of ever reaching -1 can be computed. Let me denote this probability as \( \rho \).

In the Gambler&#x27;s ruin problem, the probability of ruin starting from 0, with absorbing barriers at 0 and N, but here we have an absorbing barrier at -1 and the other at infinity. Wait, but actually, if we want the probability of ever reaching -1 starting from 0, with probability p=2/3 of moving right and q=1/3 of moving left, then the probability \( \rho \) satisfies the equation:

\( \rho = q + p \rho^2 \)

This is because starting from 0, with probability q=1/3, we go to -1 and are ruined, and with probability p=2/3, we go to +1, and then we need to reach -1 from +1, which is equivalent to the probability \( \rho^2 \) (since we have to go from +1 to 0 and then from 0 to -1, each with probability \( \rho \)).

Therefore, solving the equation \( \rho = 1/3 + (2/3) \rho^2 \).

Multiply both sides by 3: \( 3\rho = 1 + 2\rho^2 \), which becomes \( 2\rho^2 - 3\rho + 1 = 0 \).

Solving the quadratic equation: \( \rho = [3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}]/4 = [3 \pm 1]/4 \), so roots are 1 and 1/2.

Since we are looking for the probability of ruin, which is less than 1 (because the drift is positive), we take \( \rho = 1/2 \).

Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -1 is 1/2. Therefore, the probability that it ever reaches -k would be \( (1/2)^k \), as each subsequent level would require another independent ruin.

But in this case, the walk has a positive probability of eventually going to any negative level, but the probability of going to -k is \( (1/2)^k \), which is summable over k. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, since the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mathbb{P}( \text{reach } -k ) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (1/2)^k = 1 \), which converges. Wait, but Borel-Cantelli says that if the sum of probabilities is finite, then the probability that infinitely many of the events occur is 0. But here, the events are &quot;the walk reaches -k&quot;, but these are not independent events.

Wait, but actually, each time the walk reaches -k, it implies that it has reached -1, -2, ..., -k. So the events are nested. Therefore, the event that the walk reaches -k infinitely often is equivalent to the walk going to -infty. But since the probability of reaching -k is \( (1/2)^k \), the probability that it reaches -k for infinitely many k is the limit as k approaches infinity of \( (1/2)^k \), which is 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli lemma (the first one), since the sum of probabilities is finite, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty.

Alternatively, even if the walk has a positive drift, can it still have liminf -infty?

Wait, if the walk goes to +infty a.s., then the liminf is +infty. If the walk had oscillating behavior, like in the null recurrent case (symmetric walk), then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. But in our case, the walk is transient to +infty, so it cannot have liminf -infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the events \( A_k = \{ S_n \leq -k \text{ infinitely often} \} \). Then, \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is equivalent to \( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k \).

We need to compute \( \mathbb{P}( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k ) \).

By the continuity of probability measures, this is the limit as \( k \to \infty \) of \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

But \( A_{k+1} \subseteq A_k \), so the sequence \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \) is non-increasing.

Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

We know from the previous computation that \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \leq \mathbb{P}( \text{ever reaching } -k ) = (1/2)^k \).

But as \( k \to \infty \), \( (1/2)^k \to 0 \). Therefore, the probability \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \to 0 \). Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, another way is to note that since \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then for almost every sample path, there exists some integer \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq 0 \). Therefore, the liminf is at least 0. But actually, since \( S_n \to +\infty \), for any \( M &gt; 0 \), there exists \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is infinity.

Therefore, the probability that the liminf is -infty is 0.

So, after all this reasoning, I think the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a sequence \((X_{n})_{n \geq 1}\) of i.i.d. random variables where \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = -1) = \frac{1}{3}\) and \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = 1) = \frac{2}{3}\), we need to determine the value of \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty)\) for the random walk \(S_{n} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} X_{k}\) starting at \(S_{0} = 0\).

1. **Expectation and Drift**:
   - The expectation of each step \(X_n\) is \(\mathbb{E}[X_n] = \frac{1}{3}\). This positive drift indicates a tendency towards \(+\infty\).

2. **Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)**:
   - By the SLLN, \(\frac{S_n}{n} \to \frac{1}{3}\) almost surely. This implies \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely.

3. **Liminf Behavior**:
   - If \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, then for any large \(M\), there exists \(N\) such that for all \(n \geq N\), \(S_n \geq M\). Therefore, both \(\liminf S_n\) and \(\limsup S_n\) are \(+\infty\).

4. **Probability Analysis**:
   - The liminf of \(S_n\) being \(-\infty\) would require the walk to visit arbitrarily low levels infinitely often. However, due to the positive drift, the walk tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely, making such events impossible.
   - Using the Borel-Cantelli lemma, the probability of the walk reaching any negative level \(-k\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k\), which is summable. Hence, the probability of infinitely many such events is 0.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, the liminf of \(S_n\) is also \(+\infty\). Therefore, \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty) = 0\).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the liminf of the random walk \( S_n \) is \(-\infty\). The problem states that each \( X_n \) is an i.i.d. random variable with \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = 1) = \frac{2}{3} \). The process starts at \( S_0 = 0 \), and for each \( n \geq 1 \), \( S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n X_k \). The question is asking for \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \).

First, let me recall what liminf means. The liminf of a sequence \( S_n \) as \( n \to \infty \) is the smallest limit point of the sequence. In other words, it&#x27;s the infimum of all the limit points that the sequence approaches infinitely often. So if \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \), that means the sequence \( S_n \) goes arbitrarily low infinitely often. In the context of a random walk, this would imply that the walk recurrently visits every negative level, no matter how far down. 

But wait, in probability theory, when we talk about liminf and limsup of random walks, we often classify them as either transient or recurrent. A recurrent random walk returns to its starting point infinitely often with probability 1, whereas a transient random walk eventually leaves forever with probability 1. However, here we&#x27;re dealing with liminf behavior, which is a bit different. The question is about whether the walk goes to \(-\infty\) infinitely often, not necessarily returning to a specific point.

Given that the steps are i.i.d., each step has a drift. Let me compute the expected value of each step \( X_n \). The expectation is \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = (-1) \times \frac{1}{3} + 1 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{-1 + 2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \). So the drift is positive, which suggests that the walk has a tendency to drift towards \(+\infty\). But the question is about the liminf being \(-\infty\). Even if the walk drifts to \(+\infty\), it might still have liminf \(-\infty\) if it fluctuates enough downwards along the way. However, with a positive drift, maybe such fluctuations are not strong enough?

In one-dimensional random walks, there&#x27;s a concept of whether the walk is recurrent or transient. For symmetric simple random walks (like with equal probability to go left or right), the walk is recurrent in 1D and 2D, but transient in higher dimensions. However, in our case, the walk is not symmetric; it has a drift towards the right (positive direction). So perhaps it&#x27;s transient to the right, meaning that it tends to \(+\infty\) as \( n \to \infty \), but the liminf could still be \(-\infty\) or finite.

Wait, but the liminf is the infimum of the limit points. So even if the walk goes to \(+\infty\), but it fluctuates a lot, the liminf could be finite. For example, if the walk goes to \(+\infty\) but every once in a while comes back down to some finite level, the liminf would be that finite level. But if it can go arbitrarily low infinitely often, then the liminf is \(-\infty\).

So the key is to determine whether, with probability 1, the random walk \( S_n \) will reach any negative level infinitely often. If yes, then the liminf is \(-\infty\). If no, then the liminf is some finite value.

Given the walk has a positive drift, intuition says that it might be transient to \(+\infty\), but I need to check whether it is also &quot;downward transient&quot;, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t revisit negative values infinitely often.

Alternatively, perhaps there&#x27;s a theorem that relates the liminf behavior to the drift.

Alternatively, since each step has positive drift, by the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN), \( S_n / n \) converges almost surely to \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = 1/3 \). Therefore, \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely. Therefore, the liminf of \( S_n \) would be finite? Wait, if \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\), then both liminf and limsup should be \(+\infty\). But that contradicts the idea of liminf being the smallest limit point. Wait, no. If \( S_n \to +\infty \), then all limit points are \(+\infty\), so liminf is \(+\infty\). But in that case, how could liminf be \(-\infty\)?

Wait, maybe I&#x27;m confused. If the walk goes to \(+\infty\) almost surely, then with probability 1, for any large \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf would also be \(+\infty\). But that would suggest that \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

But wait, this contradicts the intuition that even with a positive drift, the walk might have fluctuations below zero. However, according to the SLLN, if the walk has a positive drift, then \( S_n \) tends to infinity almost surely, which would imply that the walk cannot go to \(-\infty\) in the liminf sense. But is that the case?

Wait, let me think again. The liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. Therefore, both liminf and limsup are infinity. Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \). But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the walk does not go to infinity almost surely? But with positive drift, I thought it does. Let me verify. For a random walk with i.i.d. steps with positive expectation, does \( S_n \to +\infty \) almost surely?

Yes, according to the SLLN, \( S_n / n \to 1/3 \) a.s., which implies that \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s. Therefore, almost every sample path goes to infinity. Therefore, for almost every path, for any \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is \(+\infty\), not \(-\infty\). So the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \) should be 0.

But wait, maybe the liminf is different? Let me check with a simple example. Suppose we have a deterministic sequence that tends to infinity. Then its liminf is infinity. If we have a sequence that has some fluctuations but still tends to infinity, then liminf is still infinity. For example, consider \( a_n = n + (-1)^n \). This sequence goes to infinity, and the liminf is infinity. So even with oscillations, if the overall trend is to infinity, liminf and limsup both are infinity.

Therefore, if \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability that \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is zero.

But wait, maybe there&#x27;s a nuance here. Let me recall that liminf is the infimum of the set of limit points.

Wait, but in some cases, even with positive drift, there can be a finite probability of the walk going to -infty. Wait, but in one dimension, if the walk is transient, it either goes to +infty or -infty. Wait, no. For asymmetric random walks on the integers, if the walk is transient, then it tends to +infty or -infty with certain probabilities. But in our case, the drift is positive, so the transience is towards +infty, but perhaps there is a 0 probability of drifting to -infty.

Alternatively, let me recall that for a random walk with positive drift, the probability that it ever reaches a negative level -k is less than 1, and actually decays exponentially with k. So, the probability that the walk ever goes below -k is something like \( (q/p)^k \), where p is the probability to go right, q to go left. In our case, p=2/3, q=1/3, so \( (q/p) = 1/2 \). Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -k is \( (1/2)^k \). Therefore, the probability that the walk goes below -k infinitely often is the probability that for infinitely many k, the walk reaches -k. But by Borel-Cantelli lemma, since the sum of probabilities \( \sum (1/2)^k \) converges, by Borel-Cantelli, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, liminf is finite.

However, in our case, since the walk has positive drift, it goes to +infty almost surely, so liminf and limsup are both +infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Wait, but let me check again. Suppose we have a simple asymmetric random walk on integers with probability p to go right and q=1-p to go left. Then, if p &gt; q, the walk is transient to the right, meaning that it tends to +infty a.s. If p &lt; q, it tends to -infty a.s. If p = q, it&#x27;s recurrent.

In our case, p=2/3 &gt; q=1/3, so the walk is transient to +infty. Therefore, with probability 1, \( S_n \to +\infty \). Therefore, \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the liminf in another way. Even if the walk goes to +infty, maybe it can have liminf -infty if it has infinitely many drops to -infty. But if the walk tends to +infty, then after some finite time, it never goes below a certain level. Therefore, the liminf would be the infimum of the sequence from that point on, which is increasing to infinity, so liminf is infinity.

But perhaps the walk can go to +infty but still have liminf -infty? Wait, no. If the walk goes to +infty, then for any M, there exists N such that for all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= M. Therefore, the liminf is at least M. Since M can be as large as we want, liminf is infinity. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty in that case.

So then, the answer is 0.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. Suppose the walk is transient to the right. Then, with probability 1, S_n tends to +infty. Therefore, liminf S_n = +infty a.s. So indeed, the probability that liminf S_n = -infty is 0. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me? Let me consider another angle.

Suppose that even though the walk tends to +infty, maybe there are infinitely many times when it goes below 0. But even if that&#x27;s the case, the liminf would be the infimum of those points. If the walk goes below 0 infinitely often, but the extent to which it goes below 0 is bounded, then liminf would be some finite negative number. However, if it can go below any negative integer infinitely often, then the liminf would be -infty.

But in our case, with positive drift, is it possible that the walk visits 0 infinitely often? If it&#x27;s transient to the right, then it can only visit 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is also finite.

Wait, but transience to the right means that the walk eventually stays on the right side, right? So, for some N, all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= 0. But is that the case?

Wait, actually, transience to the right means that the walk tends to +infty, but it might revisit the left side (negative numbers) infinitely often. Wait, but if the walk has a positive drift, can it still go below 0 infinitely often?

Hmm, this is a key point. Let me recall that in one dimension, for an asymmetric random walk with drift, whether it is transient or not is determined by the direction of the drift. If the drift is positive, then the walk tends to +infty a.s. But does that mean that it can&#x27;t go below 0 infinitely often?

No, actually, even with a positive drift, the walk might still cross below 0 infinitely often. For example, consider the case where the walk has a small positive drift. Then, there&#x27;s a positive probability that it will cross below 0 infinitely often. Wait, but actually, in the case of asymmetric random walks on integers, starting at 0, with p &gt; q, the walk is transient to +infty, which means that it visits each state finitely many times. Therefore, it can only cross 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is finite.

Wait, this is a crucial point. Let me recall that in a transient random walk to the right, the number of times the walk returns to the origin is finite. Therefore, the walk can only cross below 0 finitely many times. Therefore, after some finite time, the walk remains positive. Therefore, the liminf would be the minimum value achieved by the walk after that finite time, which is positive, and since the walk tends to infinity, the liminf would be infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty would be 0.

Alternatively, maybe in higher dimensions, but in 1D, once the walk is transient, it can&#x27;t oscillate between positive and negative infinitely often.

Wait, let me check with a concrete example. Suppose we have a biased random walk on the integers with p=2/3 and q=1/3 starting at 0. What is the probability that the walk ever reaches -1?

In general, for a biased random walk starting at 0, the probability of ever reaching -1 can be computed. Let me denote this probability as \( \rho \).

In the Gambler&#x27;s ruin problem, the probability of ruin starting from 0, with absorbing barriers at 0 and N, but here we have an absorbing barrier at -1 and the other at infinity. Wait, but actually, if we want the probability of ever reaching -1 starting from 0, with probability p=2/3 of moving right and q=1/3 of moving left, then the probability \( \rho \) satisfies the equation:

\( \rho = q + p \rho^2 \)

This is because starting from 0, with probability q=1/3, we go to -1 and are ruined, and with probability p=2/3, we go to +1, and then we need to reach -1 from +1, which is equivalent to the probability \( \rho^2 \) (since we have to go from +1 to 0 and then from 0 to -1, each with probability \( \rho \)).

Therefore, solving the equation \( \rho = 1/3 + (2/3) \rho^2 \).

Multiply both sides by 3: \( 3\rho = 1 + 2\rho^2 \), which becomes \( 2\rho^2 - 3\rho + 1 = 0 \).

Solving the quadratic equation: \( \rho = [3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}]/4 = [3 \pm 1]/4 \), so roots are 1 and 1/2.

Since we are looking for the probability of ruin, which is less than 1 (because the drift is positive), we take \( \rho = 1/2 \).

Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -1 is 1/2. Therefore, the probability that it ever reaches -k would be \( (1/2)^k \), as each subsequent level would require another independent ruin.

But in this case, the walk has a positive probability of eventually going to any negative level, but the probability of going to -k is \( (1/2)^k \), which is summable over k. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, since the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mathbb{P}( \text{reach } -k ) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (1/2)^k = 1 \), which converges. Wait, but Borel-Cantelli says that if the sum of probabilities is finite, then the probability that infinitely many of the events occur is 0. But here, the events are &quot;the walk reaches -k&quot;, but these are not independent events.

Wait, but actually, each time the walk reaches -k, it implies that it has reached -1, -2, ..., -k. So the events are nested. Therefore, the event that the walk reaches -k infinitely often is equivalent to the walk going to -infty. But since the probability of reaching -k is \( (1/2)^k \), the probability that it reaches -k for infinitely many k is the limit as k approaches infinity of \( (1/2)^k \), which is 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli lemma (the first one), since the sum of probabilities is finite, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty.

Alternatively, even if the walk has a positive drift, can it still have liminf -infty?

Wait, if the walk goes to +infty a.s., then the liminf is +infty. If the walk had oscillating behavior, like in the null recurrent case (symmetric walk), then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. But in our case, the walk is transient to +infty, so it cannot have liminf -infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the events \( A_k = \{ S_n \leq -k \text{ infinitely often} \} \). Then, \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is equivalent to \( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k \).

We need to compute \( \mathbb{P}( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k ) \).

By the continuity of probability measures, this is the limit as \( k \to \infty \) of \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

But \( A_{k+1} \subseteq A_k \), so the sequence \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \) is non-increasing.

Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

We know from the previous computation that \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \leq \mathbb{P}( \text{ever reaching } -k ) = (1/2)^k \).

But as \( k \to \infty \), \( (1/2)^k \to 0 \). Therefore, the probability \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \to 0 \). Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, another way is to note that since \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then for almost every sample path, there exists some integer \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq 0 \). Therefore, the liminf is at least 0. But actually, since \( S_n \to +\infty \), for any \( M &gt; 0 \), there exists \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is infinity.

Therefore, the probability that the liminf is -infty is 0.

So, after all this reasoning, I think the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a sequence \((X_{n})_{n \geq 1}\) of i.i.d. random variables where \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = -1) = \frac{1}{3}\) and \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = 1) = \frac{2}{3}\), we need to determine the value of \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty)\) for the random walk \(S_{n} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} X_{k}\) starting at \(S_{0} = 0\).

1. **Expectation and Drift**:
   - The expectation of each step \(X_n\) is \(\mathbb{E}[X_n] = \frac{1}{3}\). This positive drift indicates a tendency towards \(+\infty\).

2. **Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)**:
   - By the SLLN, \(\frac{S_n}{n} \to \frac{1}{3}\) almost surely. This implies \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely.

3. **Liminf Behavior**:
   - If \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, then for any large \(M\), there exists \(N\) such that for all \(n \geq N\), \(S_n \geq M\). Therefore, both \(\liminf S_n\) and \(\limsup S_n\) are \(+\infty\).

4. **Probability Analysis**:
   - The liminf of \(S_n\) being \(-\infty\) would require the walk to visit arbitrarily low levels infinitely often. However, due to the positive drift, the walk tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely, making such events impossible.
   - Using the Borel-Cantelli lemma, the probability of the walk reaching any negative level \(-k\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k\), which is summable. Hence, the probability of infinitely many such events is 0.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, the liminf of \(S_n\) is also \(+\infty\). Therefore, \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty) = 0\).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the liminf of the random walk \( S_n \) is \(-\infty\). The problem states that each \( X_n \) is an i.i.d. random variable with \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = 1) = \frac{2}{3} \). The process starts at \( S_0 = 0 \), and for each \( n \geq 1 \), \( S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n X_k \). The question is asking for \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \).

First, let me recall what liminf means. The liminf of a sequence \( S_n \) as \( n \to \infty \) is the smallest limit point of the sequence. In other words, it&#x27;s the infimum of all the limit points that the sequence approaches infinitely often. So if \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \), that means the sequence \( S_n \) goes arbitrarily low infinitely often. In the context of a random walk, this would imply that the walk recurrently visits every negative level, no matter how far down. 

But wait, in probability theory, when we talk about liminf and limsup of random walks, we often classify them as either transient or recurrent. A recurrent random walk returns to its starting point infinitely often with probability 1, whereas a transient random walk eventually leaves forever with probability 1. However, here we&#x27;re dealing with liminf behavior, which is a bit different. The question is about whether the walk goes to \(-\infty\) infinitely often, not necessarily returning to a specific point.

Given that the steps are i.i.d., each step has a drift. Let me compute the expected value of each step \( X_n \). The expectation is \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = (-1) \times \frac{1}{3} + 1 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{-1 + 2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \). So the drift is positive, which suggests that the walk has a tendency to drift towards \(+\infty\). But the question is about the liminf being \(-\infty\). Even if the walk drifts to \(+\infty\), it might still have liminf \(-\infty\) if it fluctuates enough downwards along the way. However, with a positive drift, maybe such fluctuations are not strong enough?

In one-dimensional random walks, there&#x27;s a concept of whether the walk is recurrent or transient. For symmetric simple random walks (like with equal probability to go left or right), the walk is recurrent in 1D and 2D, but transient in higher dimensions. However, in our case, the walk is not symmetric; it has a drift towards the right (positive direction). So perhaps it&#x27;s transient to the right, meaning that it tends to \(+\infty\) as \( n \to \infty \), but the liminf could still be \(-\infty\) or finite.

Wait, but the liminf is the infimum of the limit points. So even if the walk goes to \(+\infty\), but it fluctuates a lot, the liminf could be finite. For example, if the walk goes to \(+\infty\) but every once in a while comes back down to some finite level, the liminf would be that finite level. But if it can go arbitrarily low infinitely often, then the liminf is \(-\infty\).

So the key is to determine whether, with probability 1, the random walk \( S_n \) will reach any negative level infinitely often. If yes, then the liminf is \(-\infty\). If no, then the liminf is some finite value.

Given the walk has a positive drift, intuition says that it might be transient to \(+\infty\), but I need to check whether it is also &quot;downward transient&quot;, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t revisit negative values infinitely often.

Alternatively, perhaps there&#x27;s a theorem that relates the liminf behavior to the drift.

Alternatively, since each step has positive drift, by the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN), \( S_n / n \) converges almost surely to \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = 1/3 \). Therefore, \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely. Therefore, the liminf of \( S_n \) would be finite? Wait, if \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\), then both liminf and limsup should be \(+\infty\). But that contradicts the idea of liminf being the smallest limit point. Wait, no. If \( S_n \to +\infty \), then all limit points are \(+\infty\), so liminf is \(+\infty\). But in that case, how could liminf be \(-\infty\)?

Wait, maybe I&#x27;m confused. If the walk goes to \(+\infty\) almost surely, then with probability 1, for any large \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf would also be \(+\infty\). But that would suggest that \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

But wait, this contradicts the intuition that even with a positive drift, the walk might have fluctuations below zero. However, according to the SLLN, if the walk has a positive drift, then \( S_n \) tends to infinity almost surely, which would imply that the walk cannot go to \(-\infty\) in the liminf sense. But is that the case?

Wait, let me think again. The liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. Therefore, both liminf and limsup are infinity. Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \). But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the walk does not go to infinity almost surely? But with positive drift, I thought it does. Let me verify. For a random walk with i.i.d. steps with positive expectation, does \( S_n \to +\infty \) almost surely?

Yes, according to the SLLN, \( S_n / n \to 1/3 \) a.s., which implies that \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s. Therefore, almost every sample path goes to infinity. Therefore, for almost every path, for any \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is \(+\infty\), not \(-\infty\). So the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \) should be 0.

But wait, maybe the liminf is different? Let me check with a simple example. Suppose we have a deterministic sequence that tends to infinity. Then its liminf is infinity. If we have a sequence that has some fluctuations but still tends to infinity, then liminf is still infinity. For example, consider \( a_n = n + (-1)^n \). This sequence goes to infinity, and the liminf is infinity. So even with oscillations, if the overall trend is to infinity, liminf and limsup both are infinity.

Therefore, if \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability that \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is zero.

But wait, maybe there&#x27;s a nuance here. Let me recall that liminf is the infimum of the set of limit points. If the walk goes to infinity, then the set of limit points is just {+infty}, so the infimum is +infty. Therefore, the liminf is +infty. So indeed, the probability in question should be 0.

But then, why is the problem asking this? Maybe my reasoning is wrong. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the walk does not go to infinity almost surely. For example, even with positive drift, perhaps there&#x27;s a chance that the walk goes to -infty? But with positive drift, the expectation of the walk is linear in n with a positive slope, and by the SLLN, it converges to +infty. So maybe the walk cannot go to -infty.

Wait, but in some cases, even with positive drift, there can be a finite probability of the walk going to -infty. Wait, but in one dimension, if the walk is transient, it either goes to +infty or -infty. Wait, no. For asymmetric random walks on the integers, if the walk is transient, then it tends to +infty or -infty with certain probabilities. But in our case, the drift is positive, so the transience is towards +infty, but perhaps there is a 0 probability of drifting to -infty.

Wait, but the question is not about lim, but liminf. So even if the walk tends to +infty, it might have liminf -infty if it fluctuates enough. But if the walk is transient with drift to +infty, maybe those downward fluctuations are not strong enough to reach arbitrary low points infinitely often.

Alternatively, let me recall that for a random walk with positive drift, the probability that it ever reaches a negative level -k is less than 1, and actually decays exponentially with k. So, the probability that the walk ever goes below -k is something like \( (q/p)^k \), where p is the probability to go right, q to go left. In our case, p=2/3, q=1/3, so \( (q/p) = 1/2 \). Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -k is \( (1/2)^k \). Therefore, the probability that the walk goes below -k infinitely often is the probability that for infinitely many k, the walk reaches -k. But by Borel-Cantelli lemma, since the sum of probabilities \( \sum (1/2)^k \) converges, by Borel-Cantelli, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, liminf is finite.

Wait, but this contradicts the previous statement from the SLLN. Wait, but according to SLLN, the walk goes to infinity, so the liminf is infinity. But here, the argument is that the walk cannot go below arbitrary negative levels infinitely often. Therefore, the liminf is not -infty. So then, why does the liminf have to be infinity?

Wait, maybe the liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. So liminf is infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty is 0.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a difference between liminf being -infty and the walk going to -infty. If the walk goes to -infty, then liminf would be -infty. If the walk goes to +infty, liminf is +infty. But if the walk oscillates between -infty and +infty, then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. However, in our case, since the walk has positive drift, it goes to +infty almost surely, so liminf and limsup are both +infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Wait, but let me check again. Suppose we have a simple asymmetric random walk on integers with probability p to go right and q=1-p to go left. Then, if p &gt; q, the walk is transient to the right, meaning that it tends to +infty a.s. If p &lt; q, it tends to -infty a.s. If p = q, it&#x27;s recurrent.

In our case, p=2/3 &gt; q=1/3, so the walk is transient to +infty. Therefore, with probability 1, \( S_n \to +\infty \). Therefore, \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the liminf in another way. Even if the walk goes to +infty, maybe it can have liminf -infty if it has infinitely many drops to -infty. But if the walk tends to +infty, then after some finite time, it never goes below a certain level. Therefore, the liminf would be the infimum of the sequence from that point on, which is increasing to infinity, so liminf is infinity.

But perhaps the walk can go to +infty but still have liminf -infty? Wait, no. If the walk goes to +infty, then for any M, there exists N such that for all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= M. Therefore, the liminf is at least M. Since M can be as large as we want, liminf is infinity. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty in that case.

So then, the answer is 0.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. Suppose the walk is transient to the right. Then, with probability 1, S_n tends to +infty. Therefore, liminf S_n = +infty a.s. So indeed, the probability that liminf S_n = -infty is 0. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me? Let me consider another angle.

Suppose that even though the walk tends to +infty, maybe there are infinitely many times when it goes below 0. But even if that&#x27;s the case, the liminf would be the infimum of those points. If the walk goes below 0 infinitely often, but the extent to which it goes below 0 is bounded, then liminf would be some finite negative number. However, if it can go below any negative integer infinitely often, then the liminf would be -infty.

But in our case, with positive drift, is it possible that the walk visits 0 infinitely often? If it&#x27;s transient to the right, then it can only visit 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is also finite.

Wait, but transience to the right means that the walk eventually stays on the right side, right? So, for some N, all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= 0. But is that the case?

Wait, actually, transience to the right means that the walk tends to +infty, but it might revisit the left side (negative numbers) infinitely often. Wait, but if the walk has a positive drift, can it still go below 0 infinitely often?

Hmm, this is a key point. Let me recall that in one dimension, for an asymmetric random walk with drift, whether it is transient or not is determined by the direction of the drift. If the drift is positive, then the walk tends to +infty a.s. But does that mean that it can&#x27;t go below 0 infinitely often?

No, actually, even with a positive drift, the walk might still cross below 0 infinitely often. For example, consider the case where the walk has a small positive drift. Then, there&#x27;s a positive probability that it will cross below 0 infinitely often. Wait, but actually, in the case of asymmetric random walks on integers, starting at 0, with p &gt; q, the walk is transient to +infty, which means that it visits each state finitely many times. Therefore, it can only cross 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is finite.

Wait, this is a crucial point. Let me recall that in a transient random walk to the right, the number of times the walk returns to the origin is finite. Therefore, the walk can only cross below 0 finitely many times. Therefore, after some finite time, the walk remains positive. Therefore, the liminf would be the minimum value achieved by the walk after that finite time, which is positive, and since the walk tends to infinity, the liminf would be infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty would be 0.

Alternatively, maybe in higher dimensions, but in 1D, once the walk is transient, it can&#x27;t oscillate between positive and negative infinitely often.

Wait, let me check with a concrete example. Suppose we have a biased random walk on the integers with p=2/3 and q=1/3 starting at 0. What is the probability that the walk ever reaches -1?

In general, for a biased random walk starting at 0, the probability of ever reaching -1 can be computed. Let me denote this probability as \( \rho \).

In the Gambler&#x27;s ruin problem, the probability of ruin starting from 0, with absorbing barriers at 0 and N, but here we have an absorbing barrier at -1 and the other at infinity. Wait, but actually, if we want the probability of ever reaching -1 starting from 0, with probability p=2/3 of moving right and q=1/3 of moving left, then the probability \( \rho \) satisfies the equation:

\( \rho = q + p \rho^2 \)

This is because starting from 0, with probability q=1/3, we go to -1 and are ruined, and with probability p=2/3, we go to +1, and then we need to reach -1 from +1, which is equivalent to the probability \( \rho^2 \) (since we have to go from +1 to 0 and then from 0 to -1, each with probability \( \rho \)).

Therefore, solving the equation \( \rho = 1/3 + (2/3) \rho^2 \).

Multiply both sides by 3: \( 3\rho = 1 + 2\rho^2 \), which becomes \( 2\rho^2 - 3\rho + 1 = 0 \).

Solving the quadratic equation: \( \rho = [3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}]/4 = [3 \pm 1]/4 \), so roots are 1 and 1/2.

Since we are looking for the probability of ruin, which is less than 1 (because the drift is positive), we take \( \rho = 1/2 \).

Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -1 is 1/2. Therefore, the probability that it ever reaches -k would be \( (1/2)^k \), as each subsequent level would require another independent ruin.

But in this case, the walk has a positive probability of eventually going to any negative level, but the probability of going to -k is \( (1/2)^k \), which is summable over k. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, since the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mathbb{P}( \text{reach } -k ) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (1/2)^k = 1 \), which converges. Wait, but Borel-Cantelli says that if the sum of probabilities is finite, then the probability that infinitely many of the events occur is 0. But here, the events are &quot;the walk reaches -k&quot;, but these are not independent events.

Wait, but actually, each time the walk reaches -k, it implies that it has reached -1, -2, ..., -k. So the events are nested. Therefore, the event that the walk reaches -k infinitely often is equivalent to the walk going to -infty. But since the probability of reaching -k is \( (1/2)^k \), the probability that it reaches -k for infinitely many k is the limit as k approaches infinity of \( (1/2)^k \), which is 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli lemma (the first one), since the sum of probabilities is finite, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty.

Alternatively, even if the walk has a positive drift, can it still have liminf -infty?

Wait, if the walk goes to +infty a.s., then the liminf is +infty. If the walk had oscillating behavior, like in the null recurrent case (symmetric walk), then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. But in our case, the walk is transient to +infty, so it cannot have liminf -infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the events \( A_k = \{ S_n \leq -k \text{ infinitely often} \} \). Then, \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is equivalent to \( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k \).

We need to compute \( \mathbb{P}( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k ) \).

By the continuity of probability measures, this is the limit as \( k \to \infty \) of \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

But \( A_{k+1} \subseteq A_k \), so the sequence \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \) is non-increasing.

Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

We know from the previous computation that \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \leq \mathbb{P}( \text{ever reaching } -k ) = (1/2)^k \).

But as \( k \to \infty \), \( (1/2)^k \to 0 \). Therefore, the probability \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \to 0 \). Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, another way is to note that since \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then for almost every sample path, there exists some integer \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq 0 \). Therefore, the liminf is at least 0. But actually, since \( S_n \to +\infty \), for any \( M &gt; 0 \), there exists \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is infinity.

Therefore, the probability that the liminf is -infty is 0.

So, after all this reasoning, I think the answer is 0.

Given a sequence \((X_{n})_{n \geq 1}\) of i.i.d. random variables where \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = -1) = \frac{1}{3}\) and \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = 1) = \frac{2}{3}\), we need to determine the value of \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty)\) for the random walk \(S_{n} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} X_{k}\) starting at \(S_{0} = 0\).

1. **Expectation and Drift**:
   - The expectation of each step \(X_n\) is \(\mathbb{E}[X_n] = \frac{1}{3}\). This positive drift indicates a tendency towards \(+\infty\).

2. **Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)**:
   - By the SLLN, \(\frac{S_n}{n} \to \frac{1}{3}\) almost surely. This implies \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely.

3. **Liminf Behavior**:
   - If \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, then for any large \(M\), there exists \(N\) such that for all \(n \geq N\), \(S_n \geq M\). Therefore, both \(\liminf S_n\) and \(\limsup S_n\) are \(+\infty\).

4. **Probability Analysis**:
   - The liminf of \(S_n\) being \(-\infty\) would require the walk to visit arbitrarily low levels infinitely often. However, due to the positive drift, the walk tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely, making such events impossible.
   - Using the Borel-Cantelli lemma, the probability of the walk reaching any negative level \(-k\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k\), which is summable. Hence, the probability of infinitely many such events is 0.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, the liminf of \(S_n\) is also \(+\infty\). Therefore, \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty) = 0\).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the liminf of the random walk \( S_n \) is \(-\infty\). The problem states that each \( X_n \) is an i.i.d. random variable with \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = 1) = \frac{2}{3} \). The process starts at \( S_0 = 0 \), and for each \( n \geq 1 \), \( S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n X_k \). The question is asking for \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \).

First, let me recall what liminf means. The liminf of a sequence \( S_n \) as \( n \to \infty \) is the smallest limit point of the sequence. In other words, it&#x27;s the infimum of all the limit points that the sequence approaches infinitely often. So if \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \), that means the sequence \( S_n \) goes arbitrarily low infinitely often. In the context of a random walk, this would imply that the walk recurrently visits every negative level, no matter how far down. 

But wait, in probability theory, when we talk about liminf and limsup of random walks, we often classify them as either transient or recurrent. A recurrent random walk returns to its starting point infinitely often with probability 1, whereas a transient random walk eventually leaves forever with probability 1. However, here we&#x27;re dealing with liminf behavior, which is a bit different. The question is about whether the walk goes to \(-\infty\) infinitely often, not necessarily returning to a specific point.

Given that the steps are i.i.d., each step has a drift. Let me compute the expected value of each step \( X_n \). The expectation is \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = (-1) \times \frac{1}{3} + 1 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{-1 + 2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \). So the drift is positive, which suggests that the walk has a tendency to drift towards \(+\infty\). But the question is about the liminf being \(-\infty\). Even if the walk drifts to \(+\infty\), it might still have liminf \(-\infty\) if it fluctuates enough downwards along the way. However, with a positive drift, maybe such fluctuations are not strong enough?

In one-dimensional random walks, there&#x27;s a concept of whether the walk is recurrent or transient. For symmetric simple random walks (like with equal probability to go left or right), the walk is recurrent in 1D and 2D, but transient in higher dimensions. However, in our case, the walk is not symmetric; it has a drift towards the right (positive direction). So perhaps it&#x27;s transient to the right, meaning that it tends to \(+\infty\) as \( n \to \infty \), but the liminf could still be \(-\infty\) or finite.

Wait, but the liminf is the infimum of the limit points. So even if the walk goes to \(+\infty\), but it fluctuates a lot, the liminf could be finite. For example, if the walk goes to \(+\infty\) but every once in a while comes back down to some finite level, the liminf would be that finite level. But if it can go arbitrarily low infinitely often, then the liminf is \(-\infty\).

So the key is to determine whether, with probability 1, the random walk \( S_n \) will reach any negative level infinitely often. If yes, then the liminf is \(-\infty\). If no, then the liminf is some finite value.

Given the walk has a positive drift, intuition says that it might be transient to \(+\infty\), but I need to check whether it is also &quot;downward transient&quot;, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t revisit negative values infinitely often.

Alternatively, perhaps there&#x27;s a theorem that relates the liminf behavior to the drift.

Alternatively, since each step has positive drift, by the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN), \( S_n / n \) converges almost surely to \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = 1/3 \). Therefore, \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely. Therefore, the liminf of \( S_n \) would be finite? Wait, if \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\), then both liminf and limsup should be \(+\infty\). But that contradicts the idea of liminf being the smallest limit point. Wait, no. If \( S_n \to +\infty \), then all limit points are \(+\infty\), so liminf is \(+\infty\). But in that case, how could liminf be \(-\infty\)?

Wait, maybe I&#x27;m confused. If the walk goes to \(+\infty\) almost surely, then with probability 1, for any large \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf would also be \(+\infty\). But that would suggest that \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

But wait, this contradicts the intuition that even with a positive drift, the walk might have fluctuations below zero. However, according to the SLLN, if the walk has a positive drift, then \( S_n \) tends to infinity almost surely, which would imply that the walk cannot go to \(-\infty\) in the liminf sense. But is that the case?

Wait, let me think again. The liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. Therefore, both liminf and limsup are infinity. Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \). But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the walk does not go to infinity almost surely? But with positive drift, I thought it does. Let me verify. For a random walk with i.i.d. steps with positive expectation, does \( S_n \to +\infty \) almost surely?

Yes, according to the SLLN, \( S_n / n \to 1/3 \) a.s., which implies that \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s. Therefore, almost every sample path goes to infinity. Therefore, for almost every path, for any \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is \(+\infty\), not \(-\infty\). So the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \) should be 0.

But wait, maybe the liminf is different? Let me check with a simple example. Suppose we have a deterministic sequence that tends to infinity. Then its liminf is infinity. If we have a sequence that has some fluctuations but still tends to infinity, then liminf is still infinity. For example, consider \( a_n = n + (-1)^n \). This sequence goes to infinity, and the liminf is infinity. So even with oscillations, if the overall trend is to infinity, liminf and limsup both are infinity.

Therefore, if \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability that \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is zero.

But wait, maybe there&#x27;s a nuance here. Let me recall that liminf is the infimum of the set of limit points. If the walk goes to infinity, then the set of limit points is just {+infty}, so the infimum is +infty. Therefore, the liminf is +infty. So indeed, the probability in question should be 0.

But then, why is the problem asking this? Maybe my reasoning is wrong. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the walk does not go to infinity almost surely. For example, even with positive drift, perhaps there&#x27;s a chance that the walk goes to -infty? But with positive drift, the expectation of the walk is linear in n with a positive slope, and by the SLLN, it converges to +infty. So maybe the walk cannot go to -infty.

Wait, but in some cases, even with positive drift, there can be a finite probability of the walk going to -infty. Wait, but in one dimension, if the walk is transient, it either goes to +infty or -infty. Wait, no. For asymmetric random walks on the integers, if the walk is transient, then it tends to +infty or -infty with certain probabilities. But in our case, the drift is positive, so the transience is towards +infty, but perhaps there is a 0 probability of drifting to -infty.

Wait, but the question is not about lim, but liminf. So even if the walk tends to +infty, it might have liminf -infty if it fluctuates enough. But if the walk is transient with drift to +infty, maybe those downward fluctuations are not strong enough to reach arbitrary low points infinitely often.

Alternatively, let me recall that for a random walk with positive drift, the probability that it ever reaches a negative level -k is less than 1, and actually decays exponentially with k. So, the probability that the walk ever goes below -k is something like \( (q/p)^k \), where p is the probability to go right, q to go left. In our case, p=2/3, q=1/3, so \( (q/p) = 1/2 \). Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -k is \( (1/2)^k \). Therefore, the probability that the walk goes below -k infinitely often is the probability that for infinitely many k, the walk reaches -k. But by Borel-Cantelli lemma, since the sum of probabilities \( \sum (1/2)^k \) converges, by Borel-Cantelli, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, liminf is finite.

Wait, but this contradicts the previous statement from the SLLN. Wait, but according to SLLN, the walk goes to infinity, so the liminf is infinity. But here, the argument is that the walk cannot go below arbitrary negative levels infinitely often. Therefore, the liminf is not -infty. So then, why does the liminf have to be infinity?

Wait, maybe the liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. So liminf is infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty is 0.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a difference between liminf being -infty and the walk going to -infty. If the walk goes to -infty, then liminf would be -infty. If the walk goes to +infty, liminf is +infty. But if the walk oscillates between -infty and +infty, then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. However, in our case, since the walk has positive drift, it goes to +infty almost surely, so liminf and limsup are both +infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Wait, but let me check again. Suppose we have a simple asymmetric random walk on integers with probability p to go right and q=1-p to go left. Then, if p &gt; q, the walk is transient to the right, meaning that it tends to +infty a.s. If p &lt; q, it tends to -infty a.s. If p = q, it&#x27;s recurrent.

In our case, p=2/3 &gt; q=1/3, so the walk is transient to +infty. Therefore, with probability 1, \( S_n \to +\infty \). Therefore, \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the liminf in another way. Even if the walk goes to +infty, maybe it can have liminf -infty if it has infinitely many drops to -infty. But if the walk tends to +infty, then after some finite time, it never goes below a certain level. Therefore, the liminf would be the infimum of the sequence from that point on, which is increasing to infinity, so liminf is infinity.

But perhaps the walk can go to +infty but still have liminf -infty? Wait, no. If the walk goes to +infty, then for any M, there exists N such that for all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= M. Therefore, the liminf is at least M. Since M can be as large as we want, liminf is infinity. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty in that case.

So then, the answer is 0.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. Suppose the walk is transient to the right. Then, with probability 1, S_n tends to +infty. Therefore, liminf S_n = +infty a.s. So indeed, the probability that liminf S_n = -infty is 0. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me? Let me consider another angle.

Suppose that even though the walk tends to +infty, maybe there are infinitely many times when it goes below 0. But even if that&#x27;s the case, the liminf would be the infimum of those points. If the walk goes below 0 infinitely often, but the extent to which it goes below 0 is bounded, then liminf would be some finite negative number. However, if it can go below any negative integer infinitely often, then the liminf would be -infty.

But in our case, with positive drift, is it possible that the walk visits 0 infinitely often? If it&#x27;s transient to the right, then it can only visit 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is also finite.

Wait, but transience to the right means that the walk eventually stays on the right side, right? So, for some N, all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= 0. But is that the case?

Wait, actually, transience to the right means that the walk tends to +infty, but it might revisit the left side (negative numbers) infinitely often. Wait, but if the walk has a positive drift, can it still go below 0 infinitely often?

Hmm, this is a key point. Let me recall that in one dimension, for an asymmetric random walk with drift, whether it is transient or not is determined by the direction of the drift. If the drift is positive, then the walk tends to +infty a.s. But does that mean that it can&#x27;t go below 0 infinitely often?

No, actually, even with a positive drift, the walk might still cross below 0 infinitely often. For example, consider the case where the walk has a small positive drift. Then, there&#x27;s a positive probability that it will cross below 0 infinitely often. Wait, but actually, in the case of asymmetric random walks on integers, starting at 0, with p &gt; q, the walk is transient to +infty, which means that it visits each state finitely many times. Therefore, it can only cross 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is finite.

Wait, this is a crucial point. Let me recall that in a transient random walk to the right, the number of times the walk returns to the origin is finite. Therefore, the walk can only cross below 0 finitely many times. Therefore, after some finite time, the walk remains positive. Therefore, the liminf would be the minimum value achieved by the walk after that finite time, which is positive, and since the walk tends to infinity, the liminf would be infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty would be 0.

Alternatively, maybe in higher dimensions, but in 1D, once the walk is transient, it can&#x27;t oscillate between positive and negative infinitely often.

Wait, let me check with a concrete example. Suppose we have a biased random walk on the integers with p=2/3 and q=1/3 starting at 0. What is the probability that the walk ever reaches -1?

In general, for a biased random walk starting at 0, the probability of ever reaching -1 can be computed. Let me denote this probability as \( \rho \).

In the Gambler&#x27;s ruin problem, the probability of ruin starting from 0, with absorbing barriers at 0 and N, but here we have an absorbing barrier at -1 and the other at infinity. Wait, but actually, if we want the probability of ever reaching -1 starting from 0, with probability p=2/3 of moving right and q=1/3 of moving left, then the probability \( \rho \) satisfies the equation:

\( \rho = q + p \rho^2 \)

This is because starting from 0, with probability q=1/3, we go to -1 and are ruined, and with probability p=2/3, we go to +1, and then we need to reach -1 from +1, which is equivalent to the probability \( \rho^2 \) (since we have to go from +1 to 0 and then from 0 to -1, each with probability \( \rho \)).

Therefore, solving the equation \( \rho = 1/3 + (2/3) \rho^2 \).

Multiply both sides by 3: \( 3\rho = 1 + 2\rho^2 \), which becomes \( 2\rho^2 - 3\rho + 1 = 0 \).

Solving the quadratic equation: \( \rho = [3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}]/4 = [3 \pm 1]/4 \), so roots are 1 and 1/2.

Since we are looking for the probability of ruin, which is less than 1 (because the drift is positive), we take \( \rho = 1/2 \).

Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -1 is 1/2. Therefore, the probability that it ever reaches -k would be \( (1/2)^k \), as each subsequent level would require another independent ruin.

But in this case, the walk has a positive probability of eventually going to any negative level, but the probability of going to -k is \( (1/2)^k \), which is summable over k. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, since the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mathbb{P}( \text{reach } -k ) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (1/2)^k = 1 \), which converges. Wait, but Borel-Cantelli says that if the sum of probabilities is finite, then the probability that infinitely many of the events occur is 0. But here, the events are &quot;the walk reaches -k&quot;, but these are not independent events.

Wait, but actually, each time the walk reaches -k, it implies that it has reached -1, -2, ..., -k. So the events are nested. Therefore, the event that the walk reaches -k infinitely often is equivalent to the walk going to -infty. But since the probability of reaching -k is \( (1/2)^k \), the probability that it reaches -k for infinitely many k is the limit as k approaches infinity of \( (1/2)^k \), which is 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli lemma (the first one), since the sum of probabilities is finite, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty.

Alternatively, even if the walk has a positive drift, can it still have liminf -infty?

Wait, if the walk goes to +infty a.s., then the liminf is +infty. If the walk had oscillating behavior, like in the null recurrent case (symmetric walk), then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. But in our case, the walk is transient to +infty, so it cannot have liminf -infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the events \( A_k = \{ S_n \leq -k \text{ infinitely often} \} \). Then, \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is equivalent to \( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k \).

We need to compute \( \mathbb{P}( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k ) \).

By the continuity of probability measures, this is the limit as \( k \to \infty \) of \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

But \( A_{k+1} \subseteq A_k \), so the sequence \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \) is non-increasing.

Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

We know from the previous computation that \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \leq \mathbb{P}( \text{ever reaching } -k ) = (1/2)^k \).

But as \( k \to \infty \), \( (1/2)^k \to 0 \). Therefore, the probability \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \to 0 \). Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, another way is to note that since \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then for almost every sample path, there exists some integer \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq 0 \). Therefore, the liminf is at least 0. But actually, since \( S_n \to +\infty \), for any \( M &gt; 0 \), there exists \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is infinity.

Therefore, the probability that the liminf is -infty is 0.

So, after all this reasoning, I think the answer is 0.

But wait, in probability theory, when we talk about liminf and limsup of random walks, we often classify them as either transient or recurrent. A recurrent random walk returns to its starting point infinitely often with probability 1, whereas a transient random walk eventually leaves forever with probability 1. However, here we&#x27;re dealing with liminf behavior, which is a bit different. The question is about whether the walk goes to \(-\infty\) infinitely often, not necessarily returning to a specific point.

Given that the steps are i.i.d., each step has a drift. Let me compute the expected value of each step \( X_n \). The expectation is \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = (-1) \times \frac{1}{3} + 1 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{-1 + 2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \). So the drift is positive, which suggests that the walk has a tendency to drift towards \(+\infty\). But the question is about the liminf being \(-\infty\). Even if the walk drifts to \(+\infty\), it might still have liminf \(-\infty\) if it fluctuates enough downwards along the way. However, with a positive drift, maybe such fluctuations are not strong enough?

In one-dimensional random walks, there&#x27;s a concept of whether the walk is recurrent or transient. For symmetric simple random walks (like with equal probability to go left or right), the walk is recurrent in 1D and 2D, but transient in higher dimensions. However, in our case, the walk is not symmetric; it has a drift towards the right (positive direction). So perhaps it&#x27;s transient to the right, meaning that it tends to \(+\infty\) as \( n \to \infty \), but the liminf could still be \(-\infty\) or finite.

Wait, but the liminf is the infimum of the limit points. So even if the walk goes to \(+\infty\), but it fluctuates a lot, the liminf could be finite. For example, if the walk goes to \(+\infty\) but every once in a while comes back down to some finite level, the liminf would be that finite level. But if it can go arbitrarily low infinitely often, then the liminf is \(-\infty\).

So the key is to determine whether, with probability 1, the random walk \( S_n \) will reach any negative level infinitely often. If yes, then the liminf is \(-\infty\). If no, then the liminf is some finite value.

Given the walk has a positive drift, intuition says that it might be transient to \(+\infty\), but I need to check whether it is also &quot;downward transient&quot;, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t revisit negative values infinitely often.

Alternatively, perhaps there&#x27;s a theorem that relates the liminf behavior to the drift.

Alternatively, since each step has positive drift, by the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN), \( S_n / n \) converges almost surely to \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = 1/3 \). Therefore, \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely. Therefore, the liminf of \( S_n \) would be finite? Wait, if \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\), then both liminf and limsup should be \(+\infty\). But that contradicts the idea of liminf being the smallest limit point. Wait, no. If \( S_n \to +\infty \), then all limit points are \(+\infty\), so liminf is \(+\infty\). But in that case, how could liminf be \(-\infty\)?

Wait, maybe I&#x27;m confused. If the walk goes to \(+\infty\) almost surely, then with probability 1, for any large \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf would also be \(+\infty\). But that would suggest that \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

But wait, this contradicts the intuition that even with a positive drift, the walk might have fluctuations below zero. However, according to the SLLN, if the walk has a positive drift, then \( S_n \) tends to infinity almost surely, which would imply that the walk cannot go to \(-\infty\) in the liminf sense. But is that the case?

Wait, let me think again. The liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. Therefore, both liminf and limsup are infinity. Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \). But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the walk does not go to infinity almost surely? But with positive drift, I thought it does. Let me verify. For a random walk with i.i.d. steps with positive expectation, does \( S_n \to +\infty \) almost surely?

Yes, according to the SLLN, \( S_n / n \to 1/3 \) a.s., which implies that \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s. Therefore, almost every sample path goes to infinity. Therefore, for almost every path, for any \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is \(+\infty\), not \(-\infty\). So the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \) should be 0.

But wait, maybe the liminf is different? Let me check with a simple example. Suppose we have a deterministic sequence that tends to infinity. Then its liminf is infinity. If we have a sequence that has some fluctuations but still tends to infinity, then liminf is still infinity. For example, consider \( a_n = n + (-1)^n \). This sequence goes to infinity, and the liminf is infinity. So even with oscillations, if the overall trend is to infinity, liminf and limsup both are infinity.

Therefore, if \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability that \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is zero.

But wait, maybe there&#x27;s a nuance here. Let me recall that liminf is the infimum of the set of limit points. If the walk goes to infinity, then the set of limit points is just {+infty}, so the infimum is +infty. Therefore, the liminf is +infty. So indeed, the probability in question should be 0.

But then, why is the problem asking this? Maybe my reasoning is wrong. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the walk does not go to infinity almost surely. For example, even with positive drift, perhaps there&#x27;s a chance that the walk goes to -infty? But with positive drift, the expectation of the walk is linear in n with a positive slope, and by the SLLN, it converges to +infty. So maybe the walk cannot go to -infty.

Wait, but in some cases, even with positive drift, there can be a finite probability of the walk going to -infty. Wait, but in one dimension, if the walk is transient, it either goes to +infty or -infty. Wait, no. For asymmetric random walks on the integers, if the walk is transient, then it tends to +infty or -infty with certain probabilities. But in our case, the drift is positive, so the transience is towards +infty, but perhaps there is a 0 probability of drifting to -infty.

Wait, but the question is not about lim, but liminf. So even if the walk tends to +infty, it might have liminf -infty if it fluctuates enough. But if the walk is transient with drift to +infty, maybe those downward fluctuations are not strong enough to reach arbitrary low points infinitely often.

Alternatively, let me recall that for a random walk with positive drift, the probability that it ever reaches a negative level -k is less than 1, and actually decays exponentially with k. So, the probability that the walk ever goes below -k is something like \( (q/p)^k \), where p is the probability to go right, q to go left. In our case, p=2/3, q=1/3, so \( (q/p) = 1/2 \). Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -k is \( (1/2)^k \). Therefore, the probability that the walk goes below -k infinitely often is the probability that for infinitely many k, the walk reaches -k. But by Borel-Cantelli lemma, since the sum of probabilities \( \sum (1/2)^k \) converges, by Borel-Cantelli, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, liminf is finite.

Wait, but this contradicts the previous statement from the SLLN. Wait, but according to SLLN, the walk goes to infinity, so the liminf is infinity. But here, the argument is that the walk cannot go below arbitrary negative levels infinitely often. Therefore, the liminf is not -infty. So then, why does the liminf have to be infinity?

Wait, maybe the liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. So liminf is infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty is 0.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a difference between liminf being -infty and the walk going to -infty. If the walk goes to -infty, then liminf would be -infty. If the walk goes to +infty, liminf is +infty. But if the walk oscillates between -infty and +infty, then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. However, in our case, since the walk has positive drift, it goes to +infty almost surely, so liminf and limsup are both +infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Wait, but let me check again. Suppose we have a simple asymmetric random walk on integers with probability p to go right and q=1-p to go left. Then, if p &gt; q, the walk is transient to the right, meaning that it tends to +infty a.s. If p &lt; q, it tends to -infty a.s. If p = q, it&#x27;s recurrent.

In our case, p=2/3 &gt; q=1/3, so the walk is transient to +infty. Therefore, with probability 1, \( S_n \to +\infty \). Therefore, \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the liminf in another way. Even if the walk goes to +infty, maybe it can have liminf -infty if it has infinitely many drops to -infty. But if the walk tends to +infty, then after some finite time, it never goes below a certain level. Therefore, the liminf would be the infimum of the sequence from that point on, which is increasing to infinity, so liminf is infinity.

But perhaps the walk can go to +infty but still have liminf -infty? Wait, no. If the walk goes to +infty, then for any M, there exists N such that for all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= M. Therefore, the liminf is at least M. Since M can be as large as we want, liminf is infinity. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty in that case.

So then, the answer is 0.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. Suppose the walk is transient to the right. Then, with probability 1, S_n tends to +infty. Therefore, liminf S_n = +infty a.s. So indeed, the probability that liminf S_n = -infty is 0. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me? Let me consider another angle.

Suppose that even though the walk tends to +infty, maybe there are infinitely many times when it goes below 0. But even if that&#x27;s the case, the liminf would be the infimum of those points. If the walk goes below 0 infinitely often, but the extent to which it goes below 0 is bounded, then liminf would be some finite negative number. However, if it can go below any negative integer infinitely often, then the liminf would be -infty.

But in our case, with positive drift, is it possible that the walk visits 0 infinitely often? If it&#x27;s transient to the right, then it can only visit 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is also finite.

Wait, but transience to the right means that the walk eventually stays on the right side, right? So, for some N, all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= 0. But is that the case?

Wait, actually, transience to the right means that the walk tends to +infty, but it might revisit the left side (negative numbers) infinitely often. Wait, but if the walk has a positive drift, can it still go below 0 infinitely often?

Hmm, this is a key point. Let me recall that in one dimension, for an asymmetric random walk with drift, whether it is transient or not is determined by the direction of the drift. If the drift is positive, then the walk tends to +infty a.s. But does that mean that it can&#x27;t go below 0 infinitely often?

No, actually, even with a positive drift, the walk might still cross below 0 infinitely often. For example, consider the case where the walk has a small positive drift. Then, there&#x27;s a positive probability that it will cross below 0 infinitely often. Wait, but actually, in the case of asymmetric random walks on integers, starting at 0, with p &gt; q, the walk is transient to +infty, which means that it visits each state finitely many times. Therefore, it can only cross 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is finite.

Wait, this is a crucial point. Let me recall that in a transient random walk to the right, the number of times the walk returns to the origin is finite. Therefore, the walk can only cross below 0 finitely many times. Therefore, after some finite time, the walk remains positive. Therefore, the liminf would be the minimum value achieved by the walk after that finite time, which is positive, and since the walk tends to infinity, the liminf would be infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty would be 0.

Alternatively, maybe in higher dimensions, but in 1D, once the walk is transient, it can&#x27;t oscillate between positive and negative infinitely often.

Wait, let me check with a concrete example. Suppose we have a biased random walk on the integers with p=2/3 and q=1/3 starting at 0. What is the probability that the walk ever reaches -1?

In general, for a biased random walk starting at 0, the probability of ever reaching -1 can be computed. Let me denote this probability as \( \rho \).

In the Gambler&#x27;s ruin problem, the probability of ruin starting from 0, with absorbing barriers at 0 and N, but here we have an absorbing barrier at -1 and the other at infinity. Wait, but actually, if we want the probability of ever reaching -1 starting from 0, with probability p=2/3 of moving right and q=1/3 of moving left, then the probability \( \rho \) satisfies the equation:

\( \rho = q + p \rho^2 \)

This is because starting from 0, with probability q=1/3, we go to -1 and are ruined, and with probability p=2/3, we go to +1, and then we need to reach -1 from +1, which is equivalent to the probability \( \rho^2 \) (since we have to go from +1 to 0 and then from 0 to -1, each with probability \( \rho \)).

Therefore, solving the equation \( \rho = 1/3 + (2/3) \rho^2 \).

Multiply both sides by 3: \( 3\rho = 1 + 2\rho^2 \), which becomes \( 2\rho^2 - 3\rho + 1 = 0 \).

Solving the quadratic equation: \( \rho = [3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}]/4 = [3 \pm 1]/4 \), so roots are 1 and 1/2.

Since we are looking for the probability of ruin, which is less than 1 (because the drift is positive), we take \( \rho = 1/2 \).

Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -1 is 1/2. Therefore, the probability that it ever reaches -k would be \( (1/2)^k \), as each subsequent level would require another independent ruin.

But in this case, the walk has a positive probability of eventually going to any negative level, but the probability of going to -k is \( (1/2)^k \), which is summable over k. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, since the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mathbb{P}( \text{reach } -k ) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (1/2)^k = 1 \), which converges. Wait, but Borel-Cantelli says that if the sum of probabilities is finite, then the probability that infinitely many of the events occur is 0. But here, the events are &quot;the walk reaches -k&quot;, but these are not independent events.

Wait, but actually, each time the walk reaches -k, it implies that it has reached -1, -2, ..., -k. So the events are nested. Therefore, the event that the walk reaches -k infinitely often is equivalent to the walk going to -infty. But since the probability of reaching -k is \( (1/2)^k \), the probability that it reaches -k for infinitely many k is the limit as k approaches infinity of \( (1/2)^k \), which is 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli lemma (the first one), since the sum of probabilities is finite, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty.

Alternatively, even if the walk has a positive drift, can it still have liminf -infty?

Wait, if the walk goes to +infty a.s., then the liminf is +infty. If the walk had oscillating behavior, like in the null recurrent case (symmetric walk), then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. But in our case, the walk is transient to +infty, so it cannot have liminf -infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the events \( A_k = \{ S_n \leq -k \text{ infinitely often} \} \). Then, \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is equivalent to \( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k \).

We need to compute \( \mathbb{P}( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k ) \).

By the continuity of probability measures, this is the limit as \( k \to \infty \) of \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

But \( A_{k+1} \subseteq A_k \), so the sequence \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \) is non-increasing.

Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

We know from the previous computation that \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \leq \mathbb{P}( \text{ever reaching } -k ) = (1/2)^k \).

But as \( k \to \infty \), \( (1/2)^k \to 0 \). Therefore, the probability \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \to 0 \). Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, another way is to note that since \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then for almost every sample path, there exists some integer \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq 0 \). Therefore, the liminf is at least 0. But actually, since \( S_n \to +\infty \), for any \( M &gt; 0 \), there exists \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is infinity.

Therefore, the probability that the liminf is -infty is 0.

So, after all this reasoning, I think the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a sequence \((X_{n})_{n \geq 1}\) of i.i.d. random variables where \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = -1) = \frac{1}{3}\) and \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = 1) = \frac{2}{3}\), we need to determine the value of \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty)\) for the random walk \(S_{n} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} X_{k}\) starting at \(S_{0} = 0\).

1. **Expectation and Drift**:
   - The expectation of each step \(X_n\) is \(\mathbb{E}[X_n] = \frac{1}{3}\). This positive drift indicates a tendency towards \(+\infty\).

2. **Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)**:
   - By the SLLN, \(\frac{S_n}{n} \to \frac{1}{3}\) almost surely. This implies \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely.

3. **Liminf Behavior**:
   - If \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, then for any large \(M\), there exists \(N\) such that for all \(n \geq N\), \(S_n \geq M\). Therefore, both \(\liminf S_n\) and \(\limsup S_n\) are \(+\infty\).

4. **Probability Analysis**:
   - The liminf of \(S_n\) being \(-\infty\) would require the walk to visit arbitrarily low levels infinitely often. However, due to the positive drift, the walk tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely, making such events impossible.
   - Using the Borel-Cantelli lemma, the probability of the walk reaching any negative level \(-k\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k\), which is summable. Hence, the probability of infinitely many such events is 0.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, the liminf of \(S_n\) is also \(+\infty\). Therefore, \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty) = 0\).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the liminf of the random walk \( S_n \) is \(-\infty\). The problem states that each \( X_n \) is an i.i.d. random variable with \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = 1) = \frac{2}{3} \). The process starts at \( S_0 = 0 \), and for each \( n \geq 1 \), \( S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n X_k \). The question is asking for \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \).

First, let me recall what liminf means. The liminf of a sequence \( S_n \) as \( n \to \infty \) is the smallest limit point of the sequence. In other words, it&#x27;s the infimum of all the limit points that the sequence approaches infinitely often. So if \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \), that means the sequence \( S_n \) goes arbitrarily low infinitely often. In the context of a random walk, this would imply that the walk recurrently visits every negative level, no matter how far down. 

But wait, in probability theory, when we talk about liminf and limsup of random walks, we often classify them as either transient or recurrent. A recurrent random walk returns to its starting point infinitely often with probability 1, whereas a transient random walk eventually leaves forever with probability 1. However, here we&#x27;re dealing with liminf behavior, which is a bit different. The question is about whether the walk goes to \(-\infty\) infinitely often, not necessarily returning to a specific point.

Given that the steps are i.i.d., each step has a drift. Let me compute the expected value of each step \( X_n \). The expectation is \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = (-1) \times \frac{1}{3} + 1 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{-1 + 2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \). So the drift is positive, which suggests that the walk has a tendency to drift towards \(+\infty\). But the question is about the liminf being \(-\infty\). Even if the walk drifts to \(+\infty\), it might still have liminf \(-\infty\) if it fluctuates enough downwards along the way. However, with a positive drift, maybe such fluctuations are not strong enough?

In one-dimensional random walks, there&#x27;s a concept of whether the walk is recurrent or transient. For symmetric simple random walks (like with equal probability to go left or right), the walk is recurrent in 1D and 2D, but transient in higher dimensions. However, in our case, the walk is not symmetric; it has a drift towards the right (positive direction). So perhaps it&#x27;s transient to the right, meaning that it tends to \(+\infty\) as \( n \to \infty \), but the liminf could still be \(-\infty\) or finite.

Wait, but the liminf is the infimum of the limit points. So even if the walk goes to \(+\infty\), but it fluctuates a lot, the liminf could be finite. For example, if the walk goes to \(+\infty\) but every once in a while comes back down to some finite level, the liminf would be that finite level. But if it can go arbitrarily low infinitely often, then the liminf is \(-\infty\).

So the key is to determine whether, with probability 1, the random walk \( S_n \) will reach any negative level infinitely often. If yes, then the liminf is \(-\infty\). If no, then the liminf is some finite value.

Given the walk has a positive drift, intuition says that it might be transient to \(+\infty\), but I need to check whether it is also &quot;downward transient&quot;, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t revisit negative values infinitely often.

Alternatively, perhaps there&#x27;s a theorem that relates the liminf behavior to the drift.

Alternatively, since each step has positive drift, by the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN), \( S_n / n \) converges almost surely to \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = 1/3 \). Therefore, \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely. Therefore, the liminf of \( S_n \) would be finite? Wait, if \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\), then both liminf and limsup should be \(+\infty\). But that contradicts the idea of liminf being the smallest limit point. Wait, no. If \( S_n \to +\infty \), then all limit points are \(+\infty\), so liminf is \(+\infty\). But in that case, how could liminf be \(-\infty\)?

Wait, maybe I&#x27;m confused. If the walk goes to \(+\infty\) almost surely, then with probability 1, for any large \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf would also be \(+\infty\). But that would suggest that \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Yes, according to the SLLN, \( S_n / n \to 1/3 \) a.s., which implies that \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s. Therefore, almost every sample path goes to infinity. Therefore, for almost every path, for any \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is \(+\infty\), not \(-\infty\). So the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \) should be 0.

For asymmetric random walks on the integers, if the walk is transient, then it tends to +infty or -infty with certain probabilities. But in our case, the drift is positive, so the transience is towards +infty, but perhaps there is a 0 probability of drifting to -infty.

Wait, but the question is not about lim, but liminf. So even if the walk tends to +infty, it might have liminf -infty if it fluctuates enough. But if the walk is transient with drift to +infty, maybe those downward fluctuations are not strong enough to reach arbitrary low points infinitely often.

Alternatively, let me recall that for a random walk with positive drift, the probability that it ever reaches a negative level -k is less than 1, and actually decays exponentially with k. So, the probability that the walk ever goes below -k is something like \( (q/p)^k \), where p is the probability to go right, q to go left. In our case, p=2/3, q=1/3, so \( (q/p) = 1/2 \). Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -k is \( (1/2)^k \). Therefore, the probability that the walk goes below -k infinitely often is the probability that for infinitely many k, the walk reaches -k. But by Borel-Cantelli lemma, since the sum of probabilities \( \sum (1/2)^k \) converges, by Borel-Cantelli, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, liminf is finite.

Wait, but this contradicts the previous statement from the SLLN. Wait, but according to SLLN, the walk goes to infinity, so the liminf is infinity. But here, the argument is that the walk cannot go below arbitrary negative levels infinitely often. Therefore, the liminf is not -infty. So then, why does the liminf have to be infinity?

Wait, maybe the liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. So liminf is infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty is 0.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a difference between liminf being -infty and the walk going to -infty. If the walk goes to -infty, then liminf would be -infty. If the walk goes to +infty, liminf is +infty. But if the walk oscillates between -infty and +infty, then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. However, in our case, since the walk has positive drift, it goes to +infty almost surely, so liminf and limsup are both +infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Wait, but let me check again. Suppose we have a simple asymmetric random walk on integers with probability p to go right and q=1-p to go left. Then, if p &gt; q, the walk is transient to the right, meaning that it tends to +infty a.s. If p &lt; q, it tends to -infty a.s. If p = q, it&#x27;s recurrent.

In our case, p=2/3 &gt; q=1/3, so the walk is transient to +infty. Therefore, with probability 1, \( S_n \to +\infty \). Therefore, \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the liminf in another way. Even if the walk goes to +infty, maybe it can have liminf -infty if it has infinitely many drops to -infty. But if the walk tends to +infty, then after some finite time, it never goes below a certain level. Therefore, the liminf would be the infimum of the sequence from that point on, which is increasing to infinity, so liminf is infinity.

But perhaps the walk can go to +infty but still have liminf -infty? Wait, no. If the walk goes to +infty, then for any M, there exists N such that for all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= M. Therefore, the liminf is at least M. Since M can be as large as we want, liminf is infinity. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty in that case.

So then, the answer is 0.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. Suppose the walk is transient to the right. Then, with probability 1, S_n tends to +infty. Therefore, liminf S_n = +infty a.s. So indeed, the probability that liminf S_n = -infty is 0. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me? Let me consider another angle.

Suppose that even though the walk tends to +infty, maybe there are infinitely many times when it goes below 0. But even if that&#x27;s the case, the liminf would be the infimum of those points. If the walk goes below 0 infinitely often, but the extent to which it goes below 0 is bounded, then liminf would be some finite negative number. However, if it can go below any negative integer infinitely often, then the liminf would be -infty.

But in our case, with positive drift, is it possible that the walk visits 0 infinitely often? If it&#x27;s transient to the right, then it can only visit 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is also finite.

Wait, but transience to the right means that the walk eventually stays on the right side, right? So, for some N, all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= 0. But is that the case?

Wait, actually, transience to the right means that the walk tends to +infty, but it might revisit the left side (negative numbers) infinitely often. Wait, but if the walk has a positive drift, can it still go below 0 infinitely often?

Hmm, this is a key point. Let me recall that in one dimension, for an asymmetric random walk with drift, whether it is transient or not is determined by the direction of the drift. If the drift is positive, then the walk tends to +infty a.s. But does that mean that it can&#x27;t go below 0 infinitely often?

No, actually, even with a positive drift, the walk might still cross below 0 infinitely often. For example, consider the case where the walk has a small positive drift. Then, there&#x27;s a positive probability that it will cross below 0 infinitely often. Wait, but actually, in the case of asymmetric random walks on integers, starting at 0, with p &gt; q, the walk is transient to +infty, which means that it visits each state finitely many times. Therefore, it can only cross 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is finite.

Wait, this is a crucial point. Let me recall that in a transient random walk to the right, the number of times the walk returns to the origin is finite. Therefore, the walk can only cross below 0 finitely many times. Therefore, after some finite time, the walk remains positive. Therefore, the liminf would be the minimum value achieved by the walk after that finite time, which is positive, and since the walk tends to infinity, the liminf would be infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty would be 0.

Alternatively, maybe in higher dimensions, but in 1D, once the walk is transient, it can&#x27;t oscillate between positive and negative infinitely often.

Wait, let me check with a concrete example. Suppose we have a biased random walk on the integers with p=2/3 and q=1/3 starting at 0. What is the probability that the walk ever reaches -1?

In general, for a biased random walk starting at 0, the probability of ever reaching -1 can be computed. Let me denote this probability as \( \rho \).

In the Gambler&#x27;s ruin problem, the probability of ruin starting from 0, with absorbing barriers at 0 and N, but here we have an absorbing barrier at -1 and the other at infinity. Wait, but actually, if we want the probability of ever reaching -1 starting from 0, with probability p=2/3 of moving right and q=1/3 of moving left, then the probability \( \rho \) satisfies the equation:

\( \rho = q + p \rho^2 \)

This is because starting from 0, with probability q=1/3, we go to -1 and are ruined, and with probability p=2/3, we go to +1, and then we need to reach -1 from +1, which is equivalent to the probability \( \rho^2 \) (since we have to go from +1 to 0 and then from 0 to -1, each with probability \( \rho \)).

Therefore, solving the equation \( \rho = 1/3 + (2/3) \rho^2 \).

Multiply both sides by 3: \( 3\rho = 1 + 2\rho^2 \), which becomes \( 2\rho^2 - 3\rho + 1 = 0 \).

Solving the quadratic equation: \( \rho = [3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}]/4 = [3 \pm 1]/4 \), so roots are 1 and 1/2.

Since we are looking for the probability of ruin, which is less than 1 (because the drift is positive), we take \( \rho = 1/2 \).

Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -1 is 1/2. Therefore, the probability that it ever reaches -k would be \( (1/2)^k \), as each subsequent level would require another independent ruin.

But in this case, the walk has a positive probability of eventually going to any negative level, but the probability of going to -k is \( (1/2)^k \), which is summable over k. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, since the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mathbb{P}( \text{reach } -k ) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (1/2)^k = 1 \), which converges. Wait, but Borel-Cantelli says that if the sum of probabilities is finite, then the probability that infinitely many of the events occur is 0. But here, the events are &quot;the walk reaches -k&quot;, but these are not independent events.

Wait, but actually, each time the walk reaches -k, it implies that it has reached -1, -2, ..., -k. So the events are nested. Therefore, the event that the walk reaches -k infinitely often is equivalent to the walk going to -infty. But since the probability of reaching -k is \( (1/2)^k \), the probability that it reaches -k for infinitely many k is the limit as k approaches infinity of \( (1/2)^k \), which is 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli lemma (the first one), since the sum of probabilities is finite, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty.

Alternatively, even if the walk has a positive drift, can it still have liminf -infty?

Wait, if the walk goes to +infty a.s., then the liminf is +infty. If the walk had oscillating behavior, like in the null recurrent case (symmetric walk), then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. But in our case, the walk is transient to +infty, so it cannot have liminf -infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the events \( A_k = \{ S_n \leq -k \text{ infinitely often} \} \). Then, \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is equivalent to \( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k \).

We need to compute \( \mathbb{P}( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k ) \).

By the continuity of probability measures, this is the limit as \( k \to \infty \) of \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

But \( A_{k+1} \subseteq A_k \), so the sequence \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \) is non-increasing.

Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

We know from the previous computation that \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \leq \mathbb{P}( \text{ever reaching } -k ) = (1/2)^k \).

But as \( k \to \infty \), \( (1/2)^k \to 0 \). Therefore, the probability \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \to 0 \). Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, another way is to note that since \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then for almost every sample path, there exists some integer \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq 0 \). Therefore, the liminf is at least 0. But actually, since \( S_n \to +\infty \), for any \( M &gt; 0 \), there exists \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is infinity.

Therefore, the probability that the liminf is -infty is 0.

So, after all this reasoning, I think the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a sequence \((X_{n})_{n \geq 1}\) of i.i.d. random variables where \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = -1) = \frac{1}{3}\) and \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = 1) = \frac{2}{3}\), we need to determine the value of \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty)\) for the random walk \(S_{n} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} X_{k}\) starting at \(S_{0} = 0\).

1. **Expectation and Drift**:
   - The expectation of each step \(X_n\) is \(\mathbb{E}[X_n] = \frac{1}{3}\). This positive drift indicates a tendency towards \(+\infty\).

2. **Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)**:
   - By the SLLN, \(\frac{S_n}{n} \to \frac{1}{3}\) almost surely. This implies \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely.

3. **Liminf Behavior**:
   - If \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, then for any large \(M\), there exists \(N\) such that for all \(n \geq N\), \(S_n \geq M\). Therefore, both \(\liminf S_n\) and \(\limsup S_n\) are \(+\infty\).

4. **Probability Analysis**:
   - The liminf of \(S_n\) being \(-\infty\) would require the walk to visit arbitrarily low levels infinitely often. However, due to the positive drift, the walk tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely, making such events impossible.
   - Using the Borel-Cantelli lemma, the probability of the walk reaching any negative level \(-k\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k\), which is summable. Hence, the probability of infinitely many such events is 0.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, the liminf of \(S_n\) is also \(+\infty\). Therefore, \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty) = 0\).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the liminf of the random walk \( S_n \) is \(-\infty\). The problem states that each \( X_n \) is an i.i.d. random variable with \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = 1) = \frac{2}{3} \). The process starts at \( S_0 = 0 \), and for each \( n \geq 1 \), \( S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n X_k \). The question is asking for \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \).

First, let me recall what liminf means. The liminf of a sequence \( S_n \) as \( n \to \infty \) is the smallest limit point of the sequence. In other words, it&#x27;s the infimum of all the limit points that the sequence approaches infinitely often. So if \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \), that means the sequence \( S_n \) goes arbitrarily low infinitely often. In the context of a random walk, this would imply that the walk recurrently visits every negative level, no matter how far down. 

But wait, in probability theory, when we talk about liminf and limsup of random walks, we often classify them as either transient or recurrent. A recurrent random walk returns to its starting point infinitely often with probability 1, whereas a transient random walk eventually leaves forever with probability 1. However, here we&#x27;re dealing with liminf behavior, which is a bit different. The question is about whether the walk goes to \(-\infty\) infinitely often, not necessarily returning to a specific point.

Given that the steps are i.i.d., each step has a drift. Let me compute the expected value of each step \( X_n \). The expectation is \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = (-1) \times \frac{1}{3} + 1 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{-1 + 2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \). So the drift is positive, which suggests that the walk has a tendency to drift towards \(+\infty\). But the question is about the liminf being \(-\infty\). Even if the walk drifts to \(+\infty\), it might still have liminf \(-\infty\) if it fluctuates enough downwards along the way. However, with a positive drift, maybe such fluctuations are not strong enough?

In one-dimensional random walks, there&#x27;s a concept of whether the walk is recurrent or transient. For symmetric simple random walks (like with equal probability to go left or right), the walk is recurrent in 1D and 2D, but transient in higher dimensions. However, in our case, the walk is not symmetric; it has a drift towards the right (positive direction). So perhaps it&#x27;s transient to the right, meaning that it tends to \(+\infty\) as \( n \to \infty \), but the liminf could still be \(-\infty\) or finite.

Wait, but the liminf is the infimum of the limit points. So even if the walk goes to \(+\infty\), but it fluctuates a lot, the liminf could be finite. For example, if the walk goes to \(+\infty\) but every once in a while comes back down to some finite level, the liminf would be that finite level. But if it can go arbitrarily low infinitely often, then the liminf is \(-\infty\).

So the key is to determine whether, with probability 1, the random walk \( S_n \) will reach any negative level infinitely often. If yes, then the liminf is \(-\infty\). If no, then the liminf is some finite value.

Given the walk has a positive drift, intuition says that it might be transient to \(+\infty\), but I need to check whether it is also &quot;downward transient&quot;, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t revisit negative values infinitely often.

Alternatively, perhaps there&#x27;s a theorem that relates the liminf behavior to the drift.

Alternatively, since each step has positive drift, by the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN), \( S_n / n \) converges almost surely to \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = 1/3 \). Therefore, \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely. Therefore, the liminf of \( S_n \) would be finite? Wait, if \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\), then both liminf and limsup should be \(+\infty\). But that contradicts the idea of liminf being the smallest limit point. Wait, no. If \( S_n \to +\infty \), then all limit points are \(+\infty\), so liminf is \(+\infty\). But in that case, how could liminf be \(-\infty\)?

Wait, maybe I&#x27;m confused. If the walk goes to \(+\infty\) almost surely, then with probability 1, for any large \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf would also be \(+\infty\). But that would suggest that \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

But wait, this contradicts the intuition that even with a positive drift, the walk might have fluctuations below zero. However, according to the SLLN, if the walk has a positive drift, then \( S_n \) tends to infinity almost surely, which would imply that the walk cannot go to \(-\infty\) in the liminf sense. But is that the case?

Wait, let me think again. The liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. Therefore, both liminf and limsup are infinity. Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \). But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the walk does not go to infinity almost surely? But with positive drift, I thought it does. Let me verify. For a random walk with i.i.d. steps with positive expectation, does \( S_n \to +\infty \) almost surely?

Yes, according to the SLLN, \( S_n / n \to 1/3 \) a.s., which implies that \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s. Therefore, almost every sample path goes to infinity. Therefore, for almost every path, for any \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is \(+\infty\), not \(-\infty\). So the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \) should be 0.

But wait, maybe the liminf is different? Let me check with a simple example. Suppose we have a deterministic sequence that tends to infinity. Then its liminf is infinity. If we have a sequence that has some fluctuations but still tends to infinity, then liminf is still infinity. For example, consider \( a_n = n + (-1)^n \). This sequence goes to infinity, and the liminf is infinity. So even with oscillations, if the overall trend is to infinity, liminf and limsup both are infinity.

Therefore, if \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability that \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is zero.

But wait, maybe there&#x27;s a nuance here. Let me recall that liminf is the infimum of the set of limit points. If the walk goes to infinity, then the set of limit points is just {+infty}, so the infimum is +infty. Therefore, the liminf is +infty. So indeed, the probability in question should be 0.

But then, why is the problem asking this? Maybe my reasoning is wrong. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the walk does not go to infinity almost surely. For example, even with positive drift, perhaps there&#x27;s a chance that the walk goes to -infty? But with positive drift, the expectation of the walk is linear in n with a positive slope, and by the SLLN, it converges to +infty. So maybe the walk cannot go to -infty.

Wait, but in some cases, even with positive drift, there can be a finite probability of the walk going to -infty. Wait, but in one dimension, if the walk is transient, it either goes to +infty or -infty. Wait, no. For asymmetric random walks on the integers, if the walk is transient, then it tends to +infty or -infty with certain probabilities. But in our case, the drift is positive, so the transience is towards +infty, but perhaps there is a 0 probability of drifting to -infty.

Wait, but the question is not about lim, but liminf. So even if the walk tends to +infty, it might have liminf -infty if it fluctuates enough. But if the walk is transient with drift to +infty, maybe those downward fluctuations are not strong enough to reach arbitrary low points infinitely often.

Alternatively, let me recall that for a random walk with positive drift, the probability that it ever reaches a negative level -k is less than 1, and actually decays exponentially with k. So, the probability that the walk ever goes below -k is something like \( (q/p)^k \), where p is the probability to go right, q to go left. In our case, p=2/3, q=1/3, so \( (q/p) = 1/2 \). Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -k is \( (1/2)^k \). Therefore, the probability that the walk goes below -k infinitely often is the probability that for infinitely many k, the walk reaches -k. But by Borel-Cantelli lemma, since the sum of probabilities \( \sum (1/2)^k \) converges, by Borel-Cantelli, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, liminf is finite.

Wait, but this contradicts the previous statement from the SLLN. Wait, but according to SLLN, the walk goes to infinity, so the liminf is infinity. But here, the argument is that the walk cannot go below arbitrary negative levels infinitely often. Therefore, the liminf is not -infty. So then, why does the liminf have to be infinity?

Wait, maybe the liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. So liminf is infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty is 0.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a difference between liminf being -infty and the walk going to -infty. If the walk goes to -infty, then liminf would be -infty. If the walk goes to +infty, liminf is +infty. But if the walk oscillates between -infty and +infty, then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. However, in our case, since the walk has positive drift, it goes to +infty almost surely, so liminf and limsup are both +infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Wait, but let me check again. Suppose we have a simple asymmetric random walk on integers with probability p to go right and q=1-p to go left. Then, if p &gt; q, the walk is transient to the right, meaning that it tends to +infty a.s. If p &lt; q, it tends to -infty a.s. If p = q, it&#x27;s recurrent.

In our case, p=2/3 &gt; q=1/3, so the walk is transient to +infty. Therefore, with probability 1, \( S_n \to +\infty \). Therefore, \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the liminf in another way. Even if the walk goes to +infty, maybe it can have liminf -infty if it has infinitely many drops to -infty. But if the walk tends to +infty, then after some finite time, it never goes below a certain level. Therefore, the liminf would be the infimum of the sequence from that point on, which is increasing to infinity, so liminf is infinity.

Therefore, the liminf is at least M. Since M can be as large as we want, liminf is infinity. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty in that case.

So then, the answer is 0.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. Suppose the walk is transient to the right. Then, with probability 1, S_n tends to +infty. Therefore, liminf S_n = +infty a.s. So indeed, the probability that liminf S_n = -infty is 0. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

In general, for a biased random walk starting at 0, the probability of ever reaching -1 can be computed. Let me denote this probability as \( \rho \).

In the Gambler&#x27;s ruin problem, the probability of ruin starting from 0, with absorbing barriers at 0 and N, but here we have an absorbing barrier at -1 and the other at infinity. Wait, but actually, if we want the probability of ever reaching -1 starting from 0, with probability p=2/3 of moving right and q=1/3 of moving left, then the probability \( \rho \) satisfies the equation:

\( \rho = q + p \rho^2 \)

This is because starting from 0, with probability q=1/3, we go to -1 and are ruined, and with probability p=2/3, we go to +1, and then we need to reach -1 from +1, which is equivalent to the probability \( \rho^2 \) (since we have to go from +1 to 0 and then from 0 to -1, each with probability \( \rho \)).

Therefore, solving the equation \( \rho = 1/3 + (2/3) \rho^2 \).

Multiply both sides by 3: \( 3\rho = 1 + 2\rho^2 \), which becomes \( 2\rho^2 - 3\rho + 1 = 0 \).

Solving the quadratic equation: \( \rho = [3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}]/4 = [3 \pm 1]/4 \), so roots are 1 and 1/2.

Since we are looking for the probability of ruin, which is less than 1 (because the drift is positive), we take \( \rho = 1/2 \).

Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -1 is 1/2. Therefore, the probability that it ever reaches -k would be \( (1/2)^k \), as each subsequent level would require another independent ruin.

But in this case, the walk has a positive probability of eventually going to any negative level, but the probability of going to -k is \( (1/2)^k \), which is summable over k. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, since the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mathbb{P}( \text{reach } -k ) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (1/2)^k = 1 \), which converges. Wait, but Borel-Cantelli says that if the sum of probabilities is finite, then the probability that infinitely many of the events occur is 0. But here, the events are &quot;the walk reaches -k&quot;, but these are not independent events.

Wait, but actually, each time the walk reaches -k, it implies that it has reached -1, -2, ..., -k. So the events are nested. Therefore, the event that the walk reaches -k infinitely often is equivalent to the walk going to -infty. But since the probability of reaching -k is \( (1/2)^k \), the probability that it reaches -k for infinitely many k is the limit as k approaches infinity of \( (1/2)^k \), which is 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli lemma (the first one), since the sum of probabilities is finite, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty.

Alternatively, even if the walk has a positive drift, can it still have liminf -infty?

Wait, if the walk goes to +infty a.s., then the liminf is +infty. If the walk had oscillating behavior, like in the null recurrent case (symmetric walk), then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. But in our case, the walk is transient to +infty, so it cannot have liminf -infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the events \( A_k = \{ S_n \leq -k \text{ infinitely often} \} \). Then, \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is equivalent to \( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k \).

We need to compute \( \mathbb{P}( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k ) \).

By the continuity of probability measures, this is the limit as \( k \to \infty \) of \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

But \( A_{k+1} \subseteq A_k \), so the sequence \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \) is non-increasing.

Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

We know from the previous computation that \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \leq \mathbb{P}( \text{ever reaching } -k ) = (1/2)^k \).

But as \( k \to \infty \), \( (1/2)^k \to 0 \). Therefore, the probability \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \to 0 \). Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, another way is to note that since \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then for almost every sample path, there exists some integer \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq 0 \). Therefore, the liminf is at least 0. But actually, since \( S_n \to +\infty \), for any \( M &gt; 0 \), there exists \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is infinity.

Therefore, the probability that the liminf is -infty is 0.

So, after all this reasoning, I think the answer is 0.

Given a sequence \((X_{n})_{n \geq 1}\) of i.i.d. random variables where \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = -1) = \frac{1}{3}\) and \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = 1) = \frac{2}{3}\), we need to determine the value of \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty)\) for the random walk \(S_{n} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} X_{k}\) starting at \(S_{0} = 0\).

1. **Expectation and Drift**:
   - The expectation of each step \(X_n\) is \(\mathbb{E}[X_n] = \frac{1}{3}\). This positive drift indicates a tendency towards \(+\infty\).

2. **Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)**:
   - By the SLLN, \(\frac{S_n}{n} \to \frac{1}{3}\) almost surely. This implies \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely.

3. **Liminf Behavior**:
   - If \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, then for any large \(M\), there exists \(N\) such that for all \(n \geq N\), \(S_n \geq M\). Therefore, both \(\liminf S_n\) and \(\limsup S_n\) are \(+\infty\).

4. **Probability Analysis**:
   - The liminf of \(S_n\) being \(-\infty\) would require the walk to visit arbitrarily low levels infinitely often. However, due to the positive drift, the walk tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely, making such events impossible.
   - Using the Borel-Cantelli lemma, the probability of the walk reaching any negative level \(-k\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k\), which is summable. Hence, the probability of infinitely many such events is 0.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, the liminf of \(S_n\) is also \(+\infty\). Therefore, \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty) = 0\).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the liminf of the random walk \( S_n \) is \(-\infty\). The problem states that each \( X_n \) is an i.i.d. random variable with \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = 1) = \frac{2}{3} \). The process starts at \( S_0 = 0 \), and for each \( n \geq 1 \), \( S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n X_k \). The question is asking for \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \).

First, let me recall what liminf means. The liminf of a sequence \( S_n \) as \( n \to \infty \) is the smallest limit point of the sequence. In other words, it&#x27;s the infimum of all the limit points that the sequence approaches infinitely often. So if \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \), that means the sequence \( S_n \) goes arbitrarily low infinitely often. In the context of a random walk, this would imply that the walk recurrently visits every negative level, no matter how far down. 

But wait, in probability theory, when we talk about liminf and limsup of random walks, we often classify them as either transient or recurrent. A recurrent random walk returns to its starting point infinitely often with probability 1, whereas a transient random walk eventually leaves forever with probability 1. However, here we&#x27;re dealing with liminf behavior, which is a bit different. The question is about whether the walk goes to \(-\infty\) infinitely often, not necessarily returning to a specific point.

Given that the steps are i.i.d., each step has a drift. Let me compute the expected value of each step \( X_n \). The expectation is \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = (-1) \times \frac{1}{3} + 1 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{-1 + 2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \). So the drift is positive, which suggests that the walk has a tendency to drift towards \(+\infty\). But the question is about the liminf being \(-\infty\). Even if the walk drifts to \(+\infty\), it might still have liminf \(-\infty\) if it fluctuates enough downwards along the way. However, with a positive drift, maybe such fluctuations are not strong enough?

In one-dimensional random walks, there&#x27;s a concept of whether the walk is recurrent or transient. For symmetric simple random walks (like with equal probability to go left or right), the walk is recurrent in 1D and 2D, but transient in higher dimensions. However, in our case, the walk is not symmetric; it has a drift towards the right (positive direction). So perhaps it&#x27;s transient to the right, meaning that it tends to \(+\infty\) as \( n \to \infty \), but the liminf could still be \(-\infty\) or finite.

Wait, but the liminf is the infimum of the limit points. So even if the walk goes to \(+\infty\), but it fluctuates a lot, the liminf could be finite. For example, if the walk goes to \(+\infty\) but every once in a while comes back down to some finite level, the liminf would be that finite level. But if it can go arbitrarily low infinitely often, then the liminf is \(-\infty\).

So the key is to determine whether, with probability 1, the random walk \( S_n \) will reach any negative level infinitely often. If yes, then the liminf is \(-\infty\). If no, then the liminf is some finite value.

Given the walk has a positive drift, intuition says that it might be transient to \(+\infty\), but I need to check whether it is also &quot;downward transient&quot;, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t revisit negative values infinitely often.

Alternatively, perhaps there&#x27;s a theorem that relates the liminf behavior to the drift.

Alternatively, since each step has positive drift, by the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN), \( S_n / n \) converges almost surely to \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = 1/3 \). Therefore, \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely. Therefore, the liminf of \( S_n \) would be finite? Wait, if \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\), then both liminf and limsup should be \(+\infty\). But that contradicts the idea of liminf being the smallest limit point. Wait, no. If \( S_n \to +\infty \), then all limit points are \(+\infty\), so liminf is \(+\infty\). But in that case, how could liminf be \(-\infty\)?

Wait, maybe I&#x27;m confused. If the walk goes to \(+\infty\) almost surely, then with probability 1, for any large \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf would also be \(+\infty\). But that would suggest that \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

But wait, this contradicts the intuition that even with a positive drift, the walk might have fluctuations below zero. However, according to the SLLN, if the walk has a positive drift, then \( S_n \) tends to infinity almost surely, which would imply that the walk cannot go to \(-\infty\) in the liminf sense. But is that the case?

Wait, let me think again. The liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. Therefore, both liminf and limsup are infinity. Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \). But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the walk does not go to infinity almost surely? But with positive drift, I thought it does. Let me verify. For a random walk with i.i.d. steps with positive expectation, does \( S_n \to +\infty \) almost surely?

Yes, according to the SLLN, \( S_n / n \to 1/3 \) a.s., which implies that \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s. Therefore, almost every sample path goes to infinity. Therefore, for almost every path, for any \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is \(+\infty\), not \(-\infty\). So the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \) should be 0.

But wait, maybe the liminf is different? Let me check with a simple example. Suppose we have a deterministic sequence that tends to infinity. Then its liminf is infinity. If we have a sequence that has some fluctuations but still tends to infinity, then liminf is still infinity. For example, consider \( a_n = n + (-1)^n \). This sequence goes to infinity, and the liminf is infinity. So even with oscillations, if the overall trend is to infinity, liminf and limsup both are infinity.

Therefore, if \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability that \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is zero.

But wait, maybe there&#x27;s a nuance here. Let me recall that liminf is the infimum of the set of limit points. If the walk goes to infinity, then the set of limit points is just {+infty}, so the infimum is +infty. Therefore, the liminf is +infty. So indeed, the probability in question should be 0.

But then, why is the problem asking this? Maybe my reasoning is wrong. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the walk does not go to infinity almost surely. For example, even with positive drift, perhaps there&#x27;s a chance that the walk goes to -infty? But with positive drift, the expectation of the walk is linear in n with a positive slope, and by the SLLN, it converges to +infty. So maybe the walk cannot go to -infty.

Wait, but in some cases, even with positive drift, there can be a finite probability of the walk going to -infty. Wait, but in one dimension, if the walk is transient, it either goes to +infty or -infty. Wait, no. For asymmetric random walks on the integers, if the walk is transient, then it tends to +infty or -infty with certain probabilities. But in our case, the drift is positive, so the transience is towards +infty, but perhaps there is a 0 probability of drifting to -infty.

Wait, but the question is not about lim, but liminf. So even if the walk tends to +infty, it might have liminf -infty if it fluctuates enough. But if the walk is transient with drift to +infty, maybe those downward fluctuations are not strong enough to reach arbitrary low points infinitely often.

Alternatively, let me recall that for a random walk with positive drift, the probability that it ever reaches a negative level -k is less than 1, and actually decays exponentially with k. So, the probability that the walk ever goes below -k is something like \( (q/p)^k \), where p is the probability to go right, q to go left. In our case, p=2/3, q=1/3, so \( (q/p) = 1/2 \). Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -k is \( (1/2)^k \). Therefore, the probability that the walk goes below -k infinitely often is the probability that for infinitely many k, the walk reaches -k. But by Borel-Cantelli lemma, since the sum of probabilities \( \sum (1/2)^k \) converges, by Borel-Cantelli, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, liminf is finite.

Wait, but this contradicts the previous statement from the SLLN. Wait, but according to SLLN, the walk goes to infinity, so the liminf is infinity. But here, the argument is that the walk cannot go below arbitrary negative levels infinitely often. Therefore, the liminf is not -infty. So then, why does the liminf have to be infinity?

Wait, maybe the liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. So liminf is infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty is 0.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a difference between liminf being -infty and the walk going to -infty. If the walk goes to -infty, then liminf would be -infty. If the walk goes to +infty, liminf is +infty. But if the walk oscillates between -infty and +infty, then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. However, in our case, since the walk has positive drift, it goes to +infty almost surely, so liminf and limsup are both +infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Wait, but let me check again. Suppose we have a simple asymmetric random walk on integers with probability p to go right and q=1-p to go left. Then, if p &gt; q, the walk is transient to the right, meaning that it tends to +infty a.s. If p &lt; q, it tends to -infty a.s. If p = q, it&#x27;s recurrent.

In our case, p=2/3 &gt; q=1/3, so the walk is transient to +infty. Therefore, with probability 1, \( S_n \to +\infty \). Therefore, \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the liminf in another way. Even if the walk goes to +infty, maybe it can have liminf -infty if it has infinitely many drops to -infty. But if the walk tends to +infty, then after some finite time, it never goes below a certain level. Therefore, the liminf would be the infimum of the sequence from that point on, which is increasing to infinity, so liminf is infinity.

But perhaps the walk can go to +infty but still have liminf -infty? Wait, no. If the walk goes to +infty, then for any M, there exists N such that for all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= M. Therefore, the liminf is at least M. Since M can be as large as we want, liminf is infinity. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty in that case.

So then, the answer is 0.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. Suppose the walk is transient to the right. Then, with probability 1, S_n tends to +infty. Therefore, liminf S_n = +infty a.s. So indeed, the probability that liminf S_n = -infty is 0. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me? Let me consider another angle.

Suppose that even though the walk tends to +infty, maybe there are infinitely many times when it goes below 0. But even if that&#x27;s the case, the liminf would be the infimum of those points. If the walk goes below 0 infinitely often, but the extent to which it goes below 0 is bounded, then liminf would be some finite negative number. However, if it can go below any negative integer infinitely often, then the liminf would be -infty.

But in our case, with positive drift, is it possible that the walk visits 0 infinitely often? If it&#x27;s transient to the right, then it can only visit 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is also finite.

Wait, but transience to the right means that the walk eventually stays on the right side, right? So, for some N, all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= 0. But is that the case?

Wait, actually, transience to the right means that the walk tends to +infty, but it might revisit the left side (negative numbers) infinitely often. Wait, but if the walk has a positive drift, can it still go below 0 infinitely often?

Hmm, this is a key point. Let me recall that in one dimension, for an asymmetric random walk with drift, whether it is transient or not is determined by the direction of the drift. If the drift is positive, then the walk tends to +infty a.s. But does that mean that it can&#x27;t go below 0 infinitely often?

No, actually, even with a positive drift, the walk might still cross below 0 infinitely often. For example, consider the case where the walk has a small positive drift. Then, there&#x27;s a positive probability that it will cross below 0 infinitely often. Wait, but actually, in the case of asymmetric random walks on integers, starting at 0, with p &gt; q, the walk is transient to +infty, which means that it visits each state finitely many times. Therefore, it can only cross 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is finite.

Wait, this is a crucial point. Let me recall that in a transient random walk to the right, the number of times the walk returns to the origin is finite. Therefore, the walk can only cross below 0 finitely many times. Therefore, after some finite time, the walk remains positive. Therefore, the liminf would be the minimum value achieved by the walk after that finite time, which is positive, and since the walk tends to infinity, the liminf would be infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty would be 0.

Alternatively, maybe in higher dimensions, but in 1D, once the walk is transient, it can&#x27;t oscillate between positive and negative infinitely often.

Wait, let me check with a concrete example. Suppose we have a biased random walk on the integers with p=2/3 and q=1/3 starting at 0. What is the probability that the walk ever reaches -1?

In general, for a biased random walk starting at 0, the probability of ever reaching -1 can be computed. Let me denote this probability as \( \rho \).

In the Gambler&#x27;s ruin problem, the probability of ruin starting from 0, with absorbing barriers at 0 and N, but here we have an absorbing barrier at -1 and the other at infinity. Wait, but actually, if we want the probability of ever reaching -1 starting from 0, with probability p=2/3 of moving right and q=1/3 of moving left, then the probability \( \rho \) satisfies the equation:

\( \rho = q + p \rho^2 \)

This is because starting from 0, with probability q=1/3, we go to -1 and are ruined, and with probability p=2/3, we go to +1, and then we need to reach -1 from +1, which is equivalent to the probability \( \rho^2 \) (since we have to go from +1 to 0 and then from 0 to -1, each with probability \( \rho \)).

Therefore, solving the equation \( \rho = 1/3 + (2/3) \rho^2 \).

Multiply both sides by 3: \( 3\rho = 1 + 2\rho^2 \), which becomes \( 2\rho^2 - 3\rho + 1 = 0 \).

Solving the quadratic equation: \( \rho = [3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}]/4 = [3 \pm 1]/4 \), so roots are 1 and 1/2.

Since we are looking for the probability of ruin, which is less than 1 (because the drift is positive), we take \( \rho = 1/2 \).

Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -1 is 1/2. Therefore, the probability that it ever reaches -k would be \( (1/2)^k \), as each subsequent level would require another independent ruin.

But in this case, the walk has a positive probability of eventually going to any negative level, but the probability of going to -k is \( (1/2)^k \), which is summable over k. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, since the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mathbb{P}( \text{reach } -k ) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (1/2)^k = 1 \), which converges. Wait, but Borel-Cantelli says that if the sum of probabilities is finite, then the probability that infinitely many of the events occur is 0. But here, the events are &quot;the walk reaches -k&quot;, but these are not independent events.

Wait, but actually, each time the walk reaches -k, it implies that it has reached -1, -2, ..., -k. So the events are nested. Therefore, the event that the walk reaches -k infinitely often is equivalent to the walk going to -infty. But since the probability of reaching -k is \( (1/2)^k \), the probability that it reaches -k for infinitely many k is the limit as k approaches infinity of \( (1/2)^k \), which is 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli lemma (the first one), since the sum of probabilities is finite, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty.

Alternatively, even if the walk has a positive drift, can it still have liminf -infty?

Wait, if the walk goes to +infty a.s., then the liminf is +infty. If the walk had oscillating behavior, like in the null recurrent case (symmetric walk), then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. But in our case, the walk is transient to +infty, so it cannot have liminf -infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the events \( A_k = \{ S_n \leq -k \text{ infinitely often} \} \). Then, \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is equivalent to \( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k \).

We need to compute \( \mathbb{P}( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k ) \).

By the continuity of probability measures, this is the limit as \( k \to \infty \) of \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

But \( A_{k+1} \subseteq A_k \), so the sequence \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \) is non-increasing.

Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

We know from the previous computation that \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \leq \mathbb{P}( \text{ever reaching } -k ) = (1/2)^k \).

But as \( k \to \infty \), \( (1/2)^k \to 0 \). Therefore, the probability \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \to 0 \). Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, another way is to note that since \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then for almost every sample path, there exists some integer \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq 0 \). Therefore, the liminf is at least 0. But actually, since \( S_n \to +\infty \), for any \( M &gt; 0 \), there exists \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is infinity.

Therefore, the probability that the liminf is -infty is 0.

So, after all this reasoning, I think the answer is 0.

\boxed{0}

Given a sequence \((X_{n})_{n \geq 1}\) of i.i.d. random variables where \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = -1) = \frac{1}{3}\) and \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = 1) = \frac{2}{3}\), we need to determine the value of \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty)\) for the random walk \(S_{n} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} X_{k}\) starting at \(S_{0} = 0\).

1. **Expectation and Drift**:
   - The expectation of each step \(X_n\) is \(\mathbb{E}[X_n] = \frac{1}{3}\). This positive drift indicates a tendency towards \(+\infty\).

2. **Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)**:
   - By the SLLN, \(\frac{S_n}{n} \to \frac{1}{3}\) almost surely. This implies \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely.

3. **Liminf Behavior**:
   - If \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, then for any large \(M\), there exists \(N\) such that for all \(n \geq N\), \(S_n \geq M\). Therefore, both \(\liminf S_n\) and \(\limsup S_n\) are \(+\infty\).

4. **Probability Analysis**:
   - The liminf of \(S_n\) being \(-\infty\) would require the walk to visit arbitrarily low levels infinitely often. However, due to the positive drift, the walk tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely, making such events impossible.
   - Using the Borel-Cantelli lemma, the probability of the walk reaching any negative level \(-k\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k\), which is summable. Hence, the probability of infinitely many such events is 0.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, the liminf of \(S_n\) is also \(+\infty\). Therefore, \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty) = 0\).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the liminf of the random walk \( S_n \) is \(-\infty\). The problem states that each \( X_n \) is an i.i.d. random variable with \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = 1) = \frac{2}{3} \). The process starts at \( S_0 = 0 \), and for each \( n \geq 1 \), \( S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n X_k \). The question is asking for \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \).

First, let me recall what liminf means. The liminf of a sequence \( S_n \) as \( n \to \infty \) is the smallest limit point of the sequence. In other words, it&#x27;s the infimum of all the limit points that the sequence approaches infinitely often. So if \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \), that means the sequence \( S_n \) goes arbitrarily low infinitely often. In the context of a random walk, this would imply that the walk recurrently visits every negative level, no matter how far down. 

But wait, in probability theory, when we talk about liminf and limsup of random walks, we often classify them as either transient or recurrent. A recurrent random walk returns to its starting point infinitely often with probability 1, whereas a transient random walk eventually leaves forever with probability 1. However, here we&#x27;re dealing with liminf behavior, which is a bit different. The question is about whether the walk goes to \(-\infty\) infinitely often, not necessarily returning to a specific point.

Given that the steps are i.i.d., each step has a drift. Let me compute the expected value of each step \( X_n \). The expectation is \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = (-1) \times \frac{1}{3} + 1 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{-1 + 2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \). So the drift is positive, which suggests that the walk has a tendency to drift towards \(+\infty\). But the question is about the liminf being \(-\infty\). Even if the walk drifts to \(+\infty\), it might still have liminf \(-\infty\) if it fluctuates enough downwards along the way. However, with a positive drift, maybe such fluctuations are not strong enough?

In one-dimensional random walks, there&#x27;s a concept of whether the walk is recurrent or transient. For symmetric simple random walks (like with equal probability to go left or right), the walk is recurrent in 1D and 2D, but transient in higher dimensions. However, in our case, the walk is not symmetric; it has a drift towards the right (positive direction). So perhaps it&#x27;s transient to the right, meaning that it tends to \(+\infty\) as \( n \to \infty \), but the liminf could still be \(-\infty\) or finite.

Wait, but the liminf is the infimum of the limit points. So even if the walk goes to \(+\infty\), but it fluctuates a lot, the liminf could be finite. For example, if the walk goes to \(+\infty\) but every once in a while comes back down to some finite level, the liminf would be that finite level. But if it can go arbitrarily low infinitely often, then the liminf is \(-\infty\).

So the key is to determine whether, with probability 1, the random walk \( S_n \) will reach any negative level infinitely often. If yes, then the liminf is \(-\infty\). If no, then the liminf is some finite value.

Given the walk has a positive drift, intuition says that it might be transient to \(+\infty\), but I need to check whether it is also &quot;downward transient&quot;, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t revisit negative values infinitely often.

Alternatively, perhaps there&#x27;s a theorem that relates the liminf behavior to the drift.

Alternatively, since each step has positive drift, by the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN), \( S_n / n \) converges almost surely to \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = 1/3 \). Therefore, \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely. Therefore, the liminf of \( S_n \) would be finite? Wait, if \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\), then both liminf and limsup should be \(+\infty\). But that contradicts the idea of liminf being the smallest limit point. Wait, no. If \( S_n \to +\infty \), then all limit points are \(+\infty\), so liminf is \(+\infty\). But in that case, how could liminf be \(-\infty\)?

Wait, maybe I&#x27;m confused. If the walk goes to \(+\infty\) almost surely, then with probability 1, for any large \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf would also be \(+\infty\). But that would suggest that \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

But wait, this contradicts the intuition that even with a positive drift, the walk might have fluctuations below zero. However, according to the SLLN, if the walk has a positive drift, then \( S_n \) tends to infinity almost surely, which would imply that the walk cannot go to \(-\infty\) in the liminf sense. But is that the case?

Wait, let me think again. The liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. Therefore, both liminf and limsup are infinity. Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \). But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the walk does not go to infinity almost surely? But with positive drift, I thought it does. Let me verify. For a random walk with i.i.d. steps with positive expectation, does \( S_n \to +\infty \) almost surely?

Yes, according to the SLLN, \( S_n / n \to 1/3 \) a.s., which implies that \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s. Therefore, almost every sample path goes to infinity. Therefore, for almost every path, for any \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is \(+\infty\), not \(-\infty\). So the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \) should be 0.

But wait, maybe the liminf is different? Let me check with a simple example. Suppose we have a deterministic sequence that tends to infinity. Then its liminf is infinity. If we have a sequence that has some fluctuations but still tends to infinity, then liminf is still infinity. For example, consider \( a_n = n + (-1)^n \). This sequence goes to infinity, and the liminf is infinity. So even with oscillations, if the overall trend is to infinity, liminf and limsup both are infinity.

Therefore, if \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability that \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is zero.

But wait, maybe there&#x27;s a nuance here. Let me recall that liminf is the infimum of the set of limit points. If the walk goes to infinity, then the set of limit points is just {+infty}, so the infimum is +infty. Therefore, the liminf is +infty. So indeed, the probability in question should be 0.

But then, why is the problem asking this? Maybe my reasoning is wrong. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the walk does not go to infinity almost surely. For example, even with positive drift, perhaps there&#x27;s a chance that the walk goes to -infty? But with positive drift, the expectation of the walk is linear in n with a positive slope, and by the SLLN, it converges to +infty. So maybe the walk cannot go to -infty.

Wait, but in some cases, even with positive drift, there can be a finite probability of the walk going to -infty. Wait, but in one dimension, if the walk is transient, it either goes to +infty or -infty. Wait, no. For asymmetric random walks on the integers, if the walk is transient, then it tends to +infty or -infty with certain probabilities. But in our case, the drift is positive, so the transience is towards +infty, but perhaps there is a 0 probability of drifting to -infty.

Wait, but the question is not about lim, but liminf. So even if the walk tends to +infty, it might have liminf -infty if it fluctuates enough. But if the walk is transient with drift to +infty, maybe those downward fluctuations are not strong enough to reach arbitrary low points infinitely often.

Alternatively, let me recall that for a random walk with positive drift, the probability that it ever reaches a negative level -k is less than 1, and actually decays exponentially with k. So, the probability that the walk ever goes below -k is something like \( (q/p)^k \), where p is the probability to go right, q to go left. In our case, p=2/3, q=1/3, so \( (q/p) = 1/2 \). Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -k is \( (1/2)^k \). Therefore, the probability that the walk goes below -k infinitely often is the probability that for infinitely many k, the walk reaches -k. But by Borel-Cantelli lemma, since the sum of probabilities \( \sum (1/2)^k \) converges, by Borel-Cantelli, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, liminf is finite.

Wait, but this contradicts the previous statement from the SLLN. Wait, but according to SLLN, the walk goes to infinity, so the liminf is infinity. But here, the argument is that the walk cannot go below arbitrary negative levels infinitely often. Therefore, the liminf is not -infty. So then, why does the liminf have to be infinity?

Wait, maybe the liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. So liminf is infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty is 0.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a difference between liminf being -infty and the walk going to -infty. If the walk goes to -infty, then liminf would be -infty. If the walk goes to +infty, liminf is +infty. But if the walk oscillates between -infty and +infty, then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. However, in our case, since the walk has positive drift, it goes to +infty almost surely, so liminf and limsup are both +infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Wait, but let me check again. Suppose we have a simple asymmetric random walk on integers with probability p to go right and q=1-p to go left. Then, if p &gt; q, the walk is transient to the right, meaning that it tends to +infty a.s. If p &lt; q, it tends to -infty a.s. If p = q, it&#x27;s recurrent.

In our case, p=2/3 &gt; q=1/3, so the walk is transient to +infty. Therefore, with probability 1, \( S_n \to +\infty \). Therefore, \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the liminf in another way. Even if the walk goes to +infty, maybe it can have liminf -infty if it has infinitely many drops to -infty. But if the walk tends to +infty, then after some finite time, it never goes below a certain level. Therefore, the liminf would be the infimum of the sequence from that point on, which is increasing to infinity, so liminf is infinity.

But perhaps the walk can go to +infty but still have liminf -infty? Wait, no. If the walk goes to +infty, then for any M, there exists N such that for all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= M. Therefore, the liminf is at least M. Since M can be as large as we want, liminf is infinity. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty in that case.

So then, the answer is 0.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. Suppose the walk is transient to the right. Then, with probability 1, S_n tends to +infty. Therefore, liminf S_n = +infty a.s. So indeed, the probability that liminf S_n = -infty is 0. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me? Let me consider another angle.

Suppose that even though the walk tends to +infty, maybe there are infinitely many times when it goes below 0. But even if that&#x27;s the case, the liminf would be the infimum of those points. If the walk goes below 0 infinitely often, but the extent to which it goes below 0 is bounded, then liminf would be some finite negative number. However, if it can go below any negative integer infinitely often, then the liminf would be -infty.

But in our case, with positive drift, is it possible that the walk visits 0 infinitely often? If it&#x27;s transient to the right, then it can only visit 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is also finite.

Wait, but transience to the right means that the walk eventually stays on the right side, right? So, for some N, all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= 0. But is that the case?

Wait, actually, transience to the right means that the walk tends to +infty, but it might revisit the left side (negative numbers) infinitely often. Wait, but if the walk has a positive drift, can it still go below 0 infinitely often?

Hmm, this is a key point. Let me recall that in one dimension, for an asymmetric random walk with drift, whether it is transient or not is determined by the direction of the drift. If the drift is positive, then the walk tends to +infty a.s. But does that mean that it can&#x27;t go below 0 infinitely often?

No, actually, even with a positive drift, the walk might still cross below 0 infinitely often. For example, consider the case where the walk has a small positive drift. Then, there&#x27;s a positive probability that it will cross below 0 infinitely often. Wait, but actually, in the case of asymmetric random walks on integers, starting at 0, with p &gt; q, the walk is transient to +infty, which means that it visits each state finitely many times. Therefore, it can only cross 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is finite.

Wait, this is a crucial point. Let me recall that in a transient random walk to the right, the number of times the walk returns to the origin is finite. Therefore, the walk can only cross below 0 finitely many times. Therefore, after some finite time, the walk remains positive. Therefore, the liminf would be the minimum value achieved by the walk after that finite time, which is positive, and since the walk tends to infinity, the liminf would be infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty would be 0.

Alternatively, maybe in higher dimensions, but in 1D, once the walk is transient, it can&#x27;t oscillate between positive and negative infinitely often.

Wait, let me check with a concrete example. Suppose we have a biased random walk on the integers with p=2/3 and q=1/3 starting at 0. What is the probability that the walk ever reaches -1?

In general, for a biased random walk starting at 0, the probability of ever reaching -1 can be computed. Let me denote this probability as \( \rho \).

In the Gambler&#x27;s ruin problem, the probability of ruin starting from 0, with absorbing barriers at 0 and N, but here we have an absorbing barrier at -1 and the other at infinity. Wait, but actually, if we want the probability of ever reaching -1 starting from 0, with probability p=2/3 of moving right and q=1/3 of moving left, then the probability \( \rho \) satisfies the equation:

\( \rho = q + p \rho^2 \)

This is because starting from 0, with probability q=1/3, we go to -1 and are ruined, and with probability p=2/3, we go to +1, and then we need to reach -1 from +1, which is equivalent to the probability \( \rho^2 \) (since we have to go from +1 to 0 and then from 0 to -1, each with probability \( \rho \)).

Therefore, solving the equation \( \rho = 1/3 + (2/3) \rho^2 \).

Multiply both sides by 3: \( 3\rho = 1 + 2\rho^2 \), which becomes \( 2\rho^2 - 3\rho + 1 = 0 \).

Solving the quadratic equation: \( \rho = [3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}]/4 = [3 \pm 1]/4 \), so roots are 1 and 1/2.

Since we are looking for the probability of ruin, which is less than 1 (because the drift is positive), we take \( \rho = 1/2 \).

Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -1 is 1/2. Therefore, the probability that it ever reaches -k would be \( (1/2)^k \), as each subsequent level would require another independent ruin.

But in this case, the walk has a positive probability of eventually going to any negative level, but the probability of going to -k is \( (1/2)^k \), which is summable over k. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, since the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mathbb{P}( \text{reach } -k ) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (1/2)^k = 1 \), which converges. Wait, but Borel-Cantelli says that if the sum of probabilities is finite, then the probability that infinitely many of the events occur is 0. But here, the events are &quot;the walk reaches -k&quot;, but these are not independent events.

Wait, but actually, each time the walk reaches -k, it implies that it has reached -1, -2, ..., -k. So the events are nested. Therefore, the event that the walk reaches -k infinitely often is equivalent to the walk going to -infty. But since the probability of reaching -k is \( (1/2)^k \), the probability that it reaches -k for infinitely many k is the limit as k approaches infinity of \( (1/2)^k \), which is 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli lemma (the first one), since the sum of probabilities is finite, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty.

Alternatively, even if the walk has a positive drift, can it still have liminf -infty?

Wait, if the walk goes to +infty a.s., then the liminf is +infty. If the walk had oscillating behavior, like in the null recurrent case (symmetric walk), then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. But in our case, the walk is transient to +infty, so it cannot have liminf -infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the events \( A_k = \{ S_n \leq -k \text{ infinitely often} \} \). Then, \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is equivalent to \( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k \).

We need to compute \( \mathbb{P}( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k ) \).

By the continuity of probability measures, this is the limit as \( k \to \infty \) of \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

But \( A_{k+1} \subseteq A_k \), so the sequence \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \) is non-increasing.

Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

We know from the previous computation that \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \leq \mathbb{P}( \text{ever reaching } -k ) = (1/2)^k \).

But as \( k \to \infty \), \( (1/2)^k \to 0 \). Therefore, the probability \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \to 0 \). Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, another way is to note that since \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then for almost every sample path, there exists some integer \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq 0 \). Therefore, the liminf is at least 0. But actually, since \( S_n \to +\infty \), for any \( M &gt; 0 \), there exists \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is infinity.

Therefore, the probability that the liminf is -infty is 0.

So, after all this reasoning, I think the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a sequence \((X_{n})_{n \geq 1}\) of i.i.d. random variables where \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = -1) = \frac{1}{3}\) and \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = 1) = \frac{2}{3}\), we need to determine the value of \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty)\) for the random walk \(S_{n} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} X_{k}\) starting at \(S_{0} = 0\).

1. **Expectation and Drift**:
   - The expectation of each step \(X_n\) is \(\mathbb{E}[X_n] = \frac{1}{3}\). This positive drift indicates a tendency towards \(+\infty\).

2. **Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)**:
   - By the SLLN, \(\frac{S_n}{n} \to \frac{1}{3}\) almost surely. This implies \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely.

3. **Liminf Behavior**:
   - If \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, then for any large \(M\), there exists \(N\) such that for all \(n \geq N\), \(S_n \geq M\). Therefore, both \(\liminf S_n\) and \(\limsup S_n\) are \(+\infty\).

4. **Probability Analysis**:
   - The liminf of \(S_n\) being \(-\infty\) would require the walk to visit arbitrarily low levels infinitely often. However, due to the positive drift, the walk tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely, making such events impossible.
   - Using the Borel-Cantelli lemma, the probability of the walk reaching any negative level \(-k\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k\), which is summable. Hence, the probability of infinitely many such events is 0.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, the liminf of \(S_n\) is also \(+\infty\). Therefore, \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty) = 0\).

First, let me recall what liminf means. The liminf of a sequence \( S_n \) as \( n \to \infty \) is the smallest limit point of the sequence.

So the drift is positive, which suggests that the walk has a tendency to drift towards \(+\infty\). But the question is about the liminf being \(-\infty\). Even if the walk drifts to \(+\infty\), it might still have liminf \(-\infty\) if it fluctuates enough downwards along the way. However, with a positive drift, maybe such fluctuations are not strong enough?

In one-dimensional random walks, there&#x27;s a concept of whether the walk is recurrent or transient. For symmetric simple random walks (like with equal probability to go left or right), the walk is recurrent in 1D and 2D, but transient in higher dimensions.

Wait, maybe I&#x27;m confused. If the walk goes to \(+\infty\) almost surely, then with probability 1, for any large \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf would also be \(+\infty\). But that would suggest that \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

But wait, this contradicts the intuition that even with a positive drift, the walk might have fluctuations below zero. However, according to the SLLN, if the walk has a positive drift, then \( S_n \) tends to infinity almost surely, which would imply that the walk cannot go to \(-\infty\) in the liminf sense. But is that the case?

Wait, let me think again. The liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. Therefore, both liminf and limsup are infinity. Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \). But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the walk does not go to infinity almost surely? But with positive drift, I thought it does. Let me verify. For a random walk with i.i.d. steps with positive expectation, does \( S_n \to +\infty \) almost surely?

Yes, according to the SLLN, \( S_n / n \to 1/3 \) a.s., which implies that \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s. Therefore, almost every sample path goes to infinity. Therefore, for almost every path, for any \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is \(+\infty\), not \(-\infty\). So the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \) should be 0.

But wait, maybe the liminf is different? Let me check with a simple example. Suppose we have a deterministic sequence that tends to infinity. Then its liminf is infinity. If we have a sequence that has some fluctuations but still tends to infinity, then liminf is still infinity. For example, consider \( a_n = n + (-1)^n \). This sequence goes to infinity, and the liminf is infinity. So even with oscillations, if the overall trend is to infinity, liminf and limsup both are infinity.

Therefore, if \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability that \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is zero.

But wait, maybe there&#x27;s a nuance here. Let me recall that liminf is the infimum of the set of limit points. If the walk goes to infinity, then the set of limit points is just {+infty}, so the infimum is +infty. Therefore, the liminf is +infty. So indeed, the probability in question should be 0.

But then, why is the problem asking this? Maybe my reasoning is wrong. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the walk does not go to infinity almost surely. For example, even with positive drift, perhaps there&#x27;s a chance that the walk goes to -infty? But with positive drift, the expectation of the walk is linear in n with a positive slope, and by the SLLN, it converges to +infty. So maybe the walk cannot go to -infty.

Wait, but in some cases, even with positive drift, there can be a finite probability of the walk going to -infty. Wait, but in one dimension, if the walk is transient, it either goes to +infty or -infty. Wait, no. For asymmetric random walks on the integers, if the walk is transient, then it tends to +infty or -infty with certain probabilities. But in our case, the drift is positive, so the transience is towards +infty, but perhaps there is a 0 probability of drifting to -infty.

Wait, but the question is not about lim, but liminf. So even if the walk tends to +infty, it might have liminf -infty if it fluctuates enough. But if the walk is transient with drift to +infty, maybe those downward fluctuations are not strong enough to reach arbitrary low points infinitely often.

Alternatively, let me recall that for a random walk with positive drift, the probability that it ever reaches a negative level -k is less than 1, and actually decays exponentially with k. So, the probability that the walk ever goes below -k is something like \( (q/p)^k \), where p is the probability to go right, q to go left. In our case, p=2/3, q=1/3, so \( (q/p) = 1/2 \). Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -k is \( (1/2)^k \). Therefore, the probability that the walk goes below -k infinitely often is the probability that for infinitely many k, the walk reaches -k. But by Borel-Cantelli lemma, since the sum of probabilities \( \sum (1/2)^k \) converges, by Borel-Cantelli, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, liminf is finite.

Wait, but this contradicts the previous statement from the SLLN. Wait, but according to SLLN, the walk goes to infinity, so the liminf is infinity. But here, the argument is that the walk cannot go below arbitrary negative levels infinitely often. Therefore, the liminf is not -infty. So then, why does the liminf have to be infinity?

Wait, maybe the liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. So liminf is infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty is 0.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a difference between liminf being -infty and the walk going to -infty. If the walk goes to -infty, then liminf would be -infty. If the walk goes to +infty, liminf is +infty. But if the walk oscillates between -infty and +infty, then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. However, in our case, since the walk has positive drift, it goes to +infty almost surely, so liminf and limsup are both +infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Wait, but let me check again. Suppose we have a simple asymmetric random walk on integers with probability p to go right and q=1-p to go left. Then, if p &gt; q, the walk is transient to the right, meaning that it tends to +infty a.s. If p &lt; q, it tends to -infty a.s. If p = q, it&#x27;s recurrent.

In our case, p=2/3 &gt; q=1/3, so the walk is transient to +infty. Therefore, with probability 1, \( S_n \to +\infty \). Therefore, \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the liminf in another way. Even if the walk goes to +infty, maybe it can have liminf -infty if it has infinitely many drops to -infty. But if the walk tends to +infty, then after some finite time, it never goes below a certain level. Therefore, the liminf would be the infimum of the sequence from that point on, which is increasing to infinity, so liminf is infinity.

But perhaps the walk can go to +infty but still have liminf -infty? Wait, no. If the walk goes to +infty, then for any M, there exists N such that for all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= M. Therefore, the liminf is at least M. Since M can be as large as we want, liminf is infinity. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty in that case.

So then, the answer is 0.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. Suppose the walk is transient to the right. Then, with probability 1, S_n tends to +infty. Therefore, liminf S_n = +infty a.s. So indeed, the probability that liminf S_n = -infty is 0. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me? Let me consider another angle.

Suppose that even though the walk tends to +infty, maybe there are infinitely many times when it goes below 0. But even if that&#x27;s the case, the liminf would be the infimum of those points. If the walk goes below 0 infinitely often, but the extent to which it goes below 0 is bounded, then liminf would be some finite negative number. However, if it can go below any negative integer infinitely often, then the liminf would be -infty.

But in our case, with positive drift, is it possible that the walk visits 0 infinitely often? If it&#x27;s transient to the right, then it can only visit 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is also finite.

Wait, but transience to the right means that the walk eventually stays on the right side, right? So, for some N, all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= 0. But is that the case?

Wait, actually, transience to the right means that the walk tends to +infty, but it might revisit the left side (negative numbers) infinitely often. Wait, but if the walk has a positive drift, can it still go below 0 infinitely often?

Hmm, this is a key point. Let me recall that in one dimension, for an asymmetric random walk with drift, whether it is transient or not is determined by the direction of the drift. If the drift is positive, then the walk tends to +infty a.s. But does that mean that it can&#x27;t go below 0 infinitely often?

No, actually, even with a positive drift, the walk might still cross below 0 infinitely often. For example, consider the case where the walk has a small positive drift. Then, there&#x27;s a positive probability that it will cross below 0 infinitely often. Wait, but actually, in the case of asymmetric random walks on integers, starting at 0, with p &gt; q, the walk is transient to +infty, which means that it visits each state finitely many times. Therefore, it can only cross 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is finite.

Wait, this is a crucial point. Let me recall that in a transient random walk to the right, the number of times the walk returns to the origin is finite. Therefore, the walk can only cross below 0 finitely many times. Therefore, after some finite time, the walk remains positive. Therefore, the liminf would be the minimum value achieved by the walk after that finite time, which is positive, and since the walk tends to infinity, the liminf would be infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty would be 0.

Alternatively, maybe in higher dimensions, but in 1D, once the walk is transient, it can&#x27;t oscillate between positive and negative infinitely often.

Wait, let me check with a concrete example. Suppose we have a biased random walk on the integers with p=2/3 and q=1/3 starting at 0. What is the probability that the walk ever reaches -1?

In general, for a biased random walk starting at 0, the probability of ever reaching -1 can be computed. Let me denote this probability as \( \rho \).

In the Gambler&#x27;s ruin problem, the probability of ruin starting from 0, with absorbing barriers at 0 and N, but here we have an absorbing barrier at -1 and the other at infinity. Wait, but actually, if we want the probability of ever reaching -1 starting from 0, with probability p=2/3 of moving right and q=1/3 of moving left, then the probability \( \rho \) satisfies the equation:

\( \rho = q + p \rho^2 \)

This is because starting from 0, with probability q=1/3, we go to -1 and are ruined, and with probability p=2/3, we go to +1, and then we need to reach -1 from +1, which is equivalent to the probability \( \rho^2 \) (since we have to go from +1 to 0 and then from 0 to -1, each with probability \( \rho \)).

Therefore, solving the equation \( \rho = 1/3 + (2/3) \rho^2 \).

Multiply both sides by 3: \( 3\rho = 1 + 2\rho^2 \), which becomes \( 2\rho^2 - 3\rho + 1 = 0 \).

Solving the quadratic equation: \( \rho = [3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}]/4 = [3 \pm 1]/4 \), so roots are 1 and 1/2.

Since we are looking for the probability of ruin, which is less than 1 (because the drift is positive), we take \( \rho = 1/2 \).

Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -1 is 1/2. Therefore, the probability that it ever reaches -k would be \( (1/2)^k \), as each subsequent level would require another independent ruin.

But in this case, the walk has a positive probability of eventually going to any negative level, but the probability of going to -k is \( (1/2)^k \), which is summable over k. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, since the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mathbb{P}( \text{reach } -k ) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (1/2)^k = 1 \), which converges. Wait, but Borel-Cantelli says that if the sum of probabilities is finite, then the probability that infinitely many of the events occur is 0. But here, the events are &quot;the walk reaches -k&quot;, but these are not independent events.

Wait, but actually, each time the walk reaches -k, it implies that it has reached -1, -2, ..., -k. So the events are nested. Therefore, the event that the walk reaches -k infinitely often is equivalent to the walk going to -infty. But since the probability of reaching -k is \( (1/2)^k \), the probability that it reaches -k for infinitely many k is the limit as k approaches infinity of \( (1/2)^k \), which is 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli lemma (the first one), since the sum of probabilities is finite, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty.

Alternatively, even if the walk has a positive drift, can it still have liminf -infty?

Wait, if the walk goes to +infty a.s., then the liminf is +infty. If the walk had oscillating behavior, like in the null recurrent case (symmetric walk), then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. But in our case, the walk is transient to +infty, so it cannot have liminf -infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the events \( A_k = \{ S_n \leq -k \text{ infinitely often} \} \). Then, \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is equivalent to \( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k \).

We need to compute \( \mathbb{P}( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k ) \).

By the continuity of probability measures, this is the limit as \( k \to \infty \) of \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

But \( A_{k+1} \subseteq A_k \), so the sequence \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \) is non-increasing.

Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

We know from the previous computation that \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \leq \mathbb{P}( \text{ever reaching } -k ) = (1/2)^k \).

But as \( k \to \infty \), \( (1/2)^k \to 0 \). Therefore, the probability \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \to 0 \). Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, another way is to note that since \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then for almost every sample path, there exists some integer \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq 0 \). Therefore, the liminf is at least 0. But actually, since \( S_n \to +\infty \), for any \( M &gt; 0 \), there exists \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is infinity.

Therefore, the probability that the liminf is -infty is 0.

So, after all this reasoning, I think the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a sequence \((X_{n})_{n \geq 1}\) of i.i.d. random variables where \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = -1) = \frac{1}{3}\) and \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = 1) = \frac{2}{3}\), we need to determine the value of \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty)\) for the random walk \(S_{n} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} X_{k}\) starting at \(S_{0} = 0\).

1. **Expectation and Drift**:
   - The expectation of each step \(X_n\) is \(\mathbb{E}[X_n] = \frac{1}{3}\). This positive drift indicates a tendency towards \(+\infty\).

2. **Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)**:
   - By the SLLN, \(\frac{S_n}{n} \to \frac{1}{3}\) almost surely. This implies \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely.

3. **Liminf Behavior**:
   - If \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, then for any large \(M\), there exists \(N\) such that for all \(n \geq N\), \(S_n \geq M\). Therefore, both \(\liminf S_n\) and \(\limsup S_n\) are \(+\infty\).

4. **Probability Analysis**:
   - The liminf of \(S_n\) being \(-\infty\) would require the walk to visit arbitrarily low levels infinitely often. However, due to the positive drift, the walk tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely, making such events impossible.
   - Using the Borel-Cantelli lemma, the probability of the walk reaching any negative level \(-k\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k\), which is summable. Hence, the probability of infinitely many such events is 0.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, the liminf of \(S_n\) is also \(+\infty\). Therefore, \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty) = 0\).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the liminf of the random walk \( S_n \) is \(-\infty\). The problem states that each \( X_n \) is an i.i.d. random variable with \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = 1) = \frac{2}{3} \). The process starts at \( S_0 = 0 \), and for each \( n \geq 1 \), \( S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n X_k \). The question is asking for \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \).

First, let me recall what liminf means. The liminf of a sequence \( S_n \) as \( n \to \infty \) is the smallest limit point of the sequence. In other words, it&#x27;s the infimum of all the limit points that the sequence approaches infinitely often. So if \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \), that means the sequence \( S_n \) goes arbitrarily low infinitely often. In the context of a random walk, this would imply that the walk recurrently visits every negative level, no matter how far down. 

But wait, in probability theory, when we talk about liminf and limsup of random walks, we often classify them as either transient or recurrent. A recurrent random walk returns to its starting point infinitely often with probability 1, whereas a transient random walk eventually leaves forever with probability 1. However, here we&#x27;re dealing with liminf behavior, which is a bit different. The question is about whether the walk goes to \(-\infty\) infinitely often, not necessarily returning to a specific point.

Given that the steps are i.i.d., each step has a drift. Let me compute the expected value of each step \( X_n \). The expectation is \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = (-1) \times \frac{1}{3} + 1 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{-1 + 2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \). So the drift is positive, which suggests that the walk has a tendency to drift towards \(+\infty\). But the question is about the liminf being \(-\infty\). Even if the walk drifts to \(+\infty\), it might still have liminf \(-\infty\) if it fluctuates enough downwards along the way. However, with a positive drift, maybe such fluctuations are not strong enough?

In one-dimensional random walks, there&#x27;s a concept of whether the walk is recurrent or transient. For symmetric simple random walks (like with equal probability to go left or right), the walk is recurrent in 1D and 2D, but transient in higher dimensions. However, in our case, the walk is not symmetric; it has a drift towards the right (positive direction). So perhaps it&#x27;s transient to the right, meaning that it tends to \(+\infty\) as \( n \to \infty \), but the liminf could still be \(-\infty\) or finite.

Wait, but the liminf is the infimum of the limit points. So even if the walk goes to \(+\infty\), but it fluctuates a lot, the liminf could be finite. For example, if the walk goes to \(+\infty\) but every once in a while comes back down to some finite level, the liminf would be that finite level. But if it can go arbitrarily low infinitely often, then the liminf is \(-\infty\).

So the key is to determine whether, with probability 1, the random walk \( S_n \) will reach any negative level infinitely often. If yes, then the liminf is \(-\infty\). If no, then the liminf is some finite value.

Given the walk has a positive drift, intuition says that it might be transient to \(+\infty\), but I need to check whether it is also &quot;downward transient&quot;, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t revisit negative values infinitely often.

Alternatively, perhaps there&#x27;s a theorem that relates the liminf behavior to the drift.

Alternatively, since each step has positive drift, by the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN), \( S_n / n \) converges almost surely to \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = 1/3 \). Therefore, \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely. Therefore, the liminf of \( S_n \) would be finite? Wait, if \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\), then both liminf and limsup should be \(+\infty\). But that contradicts the idea of liminf being the smallest limit point. Wait, no. If \( S_n \to +\infty \), then all limit points are \(+\infty\), so liminf is \(+\infty\). But in that case, how could liminf be \(-\infty\)?

Wait, maybe I&#x27;m confused. If the walk goes to \(+\infty\) almost surely, then with probability 1, for any large \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf would also be \(+\infty\). But that would suggest that \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

But wait, this contradicts the intuition that even with a positive drift, the walk might have fluctuations below zero. However, according to the SLLN, if the walk has a positive drift, then \( S_n \) tends to infinity almost surely, which would imply that the walk cannot go to \(-\infty\) in the liminf sense. But is that the case?

Wait, let me think again. The liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. Therefore, both liminf and limsup are infinity. Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \). But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the walk does not go to infinity almost surely? But with positive drift, I thought it does. Let me verify. For a random walk with i.i.d. steps with positive expectation, does \( S_n \to +\infty \) almost surely?

Yes, according to the SLLN, \( S_n / n \to 1/3 \) a.s., which implies that \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s. Therefore, almost every sample path goes to infinity. Therefore, for almost every path, for any \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is \(+\infty\), not \(-\infty\). So the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \) should be 0.

But wait, maybe the liminf is different? Let me check with a simple example. Suppose we have a deterministic sequence that tends to infinity. Then its liminf is infinity. If we have a sequence that has some fluctuations but still tends to infinity, then liminf is still infinity. For example, consider \( a_n = n + (-1)^n \). This sequence goes to infinity, and the liminf is infinity. So even with oscillations, if the overall trend is to infinity, liminf and limsup both are infinity.

Therefore, if \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability that \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is zero.

But wait, maybe there&#x27;s a nuance here. Let me recall that liminf is the infimum of the set of limit points.

Wait, but in some cases, even with positive drift, there can be a finite probability of the walk going to -infty. Wait, but in one dimension, if the walk is transient, it either goes to +infty or -infty. Wait, no. For asymmetric random walks on the integers, if the walk is transient, then it tends to +infty or -infty with certain probabilities. But in our case, the drift is positive, so the transience is towards +infty, but perhaps there is a 0 probability of drifting to -infty.

Alternatively, let me recall that for a random walk with positive drift, the probability that it ever reaches a negative level -k is less than 1, and actually decays exponentially with k. So, the probability that the walk ever goes below -k is something like \( (q/p)^k \), where p is the probability to go right, q to go left. In our case, p=2/3, q=1/3, so \( (q/p) = 1/2 \). Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -k is \( (1/2)^k \). Therefore, the probability that the walk goes below -k infinitely often is the probability that for infinitely many k, the walk reaches -k. But by Borel-Cantelli lemma, since the sum of probabilities \( \sum (1/2)^k \) converges, by Borel-Cantelli, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, liminf is finite.

However, in our case, since the walk has positive drift, it goes to +infty almost surely, so liminf and limsup are both +infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Wait, but let me check again. Suppose we have a simple asymmetric random walk on integers with probability p to go right and q=1-p to go left. Then, if p &gt; q, the walk is transient to the right, meaning that it tends to +infty a.s. If p &lt; q, it tends to -infty a.s. If p = q, it&#x27;s recurrent.

In our case, p=2/3 &gt; q=1/3, so the walk is transient to +infty. Therefore, with probability 1, \( S_n \to +\infty \). Therefore, \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the liminf in another way. Even if the walk goes to +infty, maybe it can have liminf -infty if it has infinitely many drops to -infty. But if the walk tends to +infty, then after some finite time, it never goes below a certain level. Therefore, the liminf would be the infimum of the sequence from that point on, which is increasing to infinity, so liminf is infinity.

But perhaps the walk can go to +infty but still have liminf -infty? Wait, no. If the walk goes to +infty, then for any M, there exists N such that for all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= M. Therefore, the liminf is at least M. Since M can be as large as we want, liminf is infinity. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty in that case.

So then, the answer is 0.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. Suppose the walk is transient to the right. Then, with probability 1, S_n tends to +infty. Therefore, liminf S_n = +infty a.s. So indeed, the probability that liminf S_n = -infty is 0. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me? Let me consider another angle.

Suppose that even though the walk tends to +infty, maybe there are infinitely many times when it goes below 0. But even if that&#x27;s the case, the liminf would be the infimum of those points. If the walk goes below 0 infinitely often, but the extent to which it goes below 0 is bounded, then liminf would be some finite negative number. However, if it can go below any negative integer infinitely often, then the liminf would be -infty.

But in our case, with positive drift, is it possible that the walk visits 0 infinitely often? If it&#x27;s transient to the right, then it can only visit 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is also finite.

Wait, but transience to the right means that the walk eventually stays on the right side, right? So, for some N, all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= 0. But is that the case?

Wait, actually, transience to the right means that the walk tends to +infty, but it might revisit the left side (negative numbers) infinitely often. Wait, but if the walk has a positive drift, can it still go below 0 infinitely often?

Hmm, this is a key point. Let me recall that in one dimension, for an asymmetric random walk with drift, whether it is transient or not is determined by the direction of the drift. If the drift is positive, then the walk tends to +infty a.s. But does that mean that it can&#x27;t go below 0 infinitely often?

No, actually, even with a positive drift, the walk might still cross below 0 infinitely often. For example, consider the case where the walk has a small positive drift. Then, there&#x27;s a positive probability that it will cross below 0 infinitely often. Wait, but actually, in the case of asymmetric random walks on integers, starting at 0, with p &gt; q, the walk is transient to +infty, which means that it visits each state finitely many times. Therefore, it can only cross 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is finite.

Wait, this is a crucial point. Let me recall that in a transient random walk to the right, the number of times the walk returns to the origin is finite. Therefore, the walk can only cross below 0 finitely many times. Therefore, after some finite time, the walk remains positive. Therefore, the liminf would be the minimum value achieved by the walk after that finite time, which is positive, and since the walk tends to infinity, the liminf would be infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty would be 0.

Alternatively, maybe in higher dimensions, but in 1D, once the walk is transient, it can&#x27;t oscillate between positive and negative infinitely often.

Wait, let me check with a concrete example. Suppose we have a biased random walk on the integers with p=2/3 and q=1/3 starting at 0. What is the probability that the walk ever reaches -1?

In general, for a biased random walk starting at 0, the probability of ever reaching -1 can be computed. Let me denote this probability as \( \rho \).

In the Gambler&#x27;s ruin problem, the probability of ruin starting from 0, with absorbing barriers at 0 and N, but here we have an absorbing barrier at -1 and the other at infinity. Wait, but actually, if we want the probability of ever reaching -1 starting from 0, with probability p=2/3 of moving right and q=1/3 of moving left, then the probability \( \rho \) satisfies the equation:

\( \rho = q + p \rho^2 \)

This is because starting from 0, with probability q=1/3, we go to -1 and are ruined, and with probability p=2/3, we go to +1, and then we need to reach -1 from +1, which is equivalent to the probability \( \rho^2 \) (since we have to go from +1 to 0 and then from 0 to -1, each with probability \( \rho \)).

Therefore, solving the equation \( \rho = 1/3 + (2/3) \rho^2 \).

Multiply both sides by 3: \( 3\rho = 1 + 2\rho^2 \), which becomes \( 2\rho^2 - 3\rho + 1 = 0 \).

Solving the quadratic equation: \( \rho = [3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}]/4 = [3 \pm 1]/4 \), so roots are 1 and 1/2.

Since we are looking for the probability of ruin, which is less than 1 (because the drift is positive), we take \( \rho = 1/2 \).

Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -1 is 1/2. Therefore, the probability that it ever reaches -k would be \( (1/2)^k \), as each subsequent level would require another independent ruin.

But in this case, the walk has a positive probability of eventually going to any negative level, but the probability of going to -k is \( (1/2)^k \), which is summable over k. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, since the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mathbb{P}( \text{reach } -k ) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (1/2)^k = 1 \), which converges. Wait, but Borel-Cantelli says that if the sum of probabilities is finite, then the probability that infinitely many of the events occur is 0. But here, the events are &quot;the walk reaches -k&quot;, but these are not independent events.

Wait, but actually, each time the walk reaches -k, it implies that it has reached -1, -2, ..., -k. So the events are nested. Therefore, the event that the walk reaches -k infinitely often is equivalent to the walk going to -infty. But since the probability of reaching -k is \( (1/2)^k \), the probability that it reaches -k for infinitely many k is the limit as k approaches infinity of \( (1/2)^k \), which is 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli lemma (the first one), since the sum of probabilities is finite, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty.

Alternatively, even if the walk has a positive drift, can it still have liminf -infty?

Wait, if the walk goes to +infty a.s., then the liminf is +infty. If the walk had oscillating behavior, like in the null recurrent case (symmetric walk), then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. But in our case, the walk is transient to +infty, so it cannot have liminf -infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the events \( A_k = \{ S_n \leq -k \text{ infinitely often} \} \). Then, \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is equivalent to \( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k \).

We need to compute \( \mathbb{P}( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k ) \).

By the continuity of probability measures, this is the limit as \( k \to \infty \) of \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

But \( A_{k+1} \subseteq A_k \), so the sequence \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \) is non-increasing.

Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

We know from the previous computation that \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \leq \mathbb{P}( \text{ever reaching } -k ) = (1/2)^k \).

But as \( k \to \infty \), \( (1/2)^k \to 0 \). Therefore, the probability \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \to 0 \). Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, another way is to note that since \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then for almost every sample path, there exists some integer \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq 0 \). Therefore, the liminf is at least 0. But actually, since \( S_n \to +\infty \), for any \( M &gt; 0 \), there exists \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is infinity.

Therefore, the probability that the liminf is -infty is 0.

So, after all this reasoning, I think the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a sequence \((X_{n})_{n \geq 1}\) of i.i.d. random variables where \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = -1) = \frac{1}{3}\) and \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = 1) = \frac{2}{3}\), we need to determine the value of \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty)\) for the random walk \(S_{n} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} X_{k}\) starting at \(S_{0} = 0\).

1. **Expectation and Drift**:
   - The expectation of each step \(X_n\) is \(\mathbb{E}[X_n] = \frac{1}{3}\). This positive drift indicates a tendency towards \(+\infty\).

2. **Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)**:
   - By the SLLN, \(\frac{S_n}{n} \to \frac{1}{3}\) almost surely. This implies \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely.

3. **Liminf Behavior**:
   - If \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, then for any large \(M\), there exists \(N\) such that for all \(n \geq N\), \(S_n \geq M\). Therefore, both \(\liminf S_n\) and \(\limsup S_n\) are \(+\infty\).

4. **Probability Analysis**:
   - The liminf of \(S_n\) being \(-\infty\) would require the walk to visit arbitrarily low levels infinitely often. However, due to the positive drift, the walk tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely, making such events impossible.
   - Using the Borel-Cantelli lemma, the probability of the walk reaching any negative level \(-k\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k\), which is summable. Hence, the probability of infinitely many such events is 0.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, the liminf of \(S_n\) is also \(+\infty\). Therefore, \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty) = 0\).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the liminf of the random walk \( S_n \) is \(-\infty\). The problem states that each \( X_n \) is an i.i.d. random variable with \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( \mathbb{P}(X_n = 1) = \frac{2}{3} \). The process starts at \( S_0 = 0 \), and for each \( n \geq 1 \), \( S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n X_k \). The question is asking for \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \).

First, let me recall what liminf means. The liminf of a sequence \( S_n \) as \( n \to \infty \) is the smallest limit point of the sequence. In other words, it&#x27;s the infimum of all the limit points that the sequence approaches infinitely often. So if \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \), that means the sequence \( S_n \) goes arbitrarily low infinitely often. In the context of a random walk, this would imply that the walk recurrently visits every negative level, no matter how far down. 

But wait, in probability theory, when we talk about liminf and limsup of random walks, we often classify them as either transient or recurrent. A recurrent random walk returns to its starting point infinitely often with probability 1, whereas a transient random walk eventually leaves forever with probability 1. However, here we&#x27;re dealing with liminf behavior, which is a bit different. The question is about whether the walk goes to \(-\infty\) infinitely often, not necessarily returning to a specific point.

Given that the steps are i.i.d., each step has a drift. Let me compute the expected value of each step \( X_n \). The expectation is \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = (-1) \times \frac{1}{3} + 1 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{-1 + 2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \). So the drift is positive, which suggests that the walk has a tendency to drift towards \(+\infty\). But the question is about the liminf being \(-\infty\). Even if the walk drifts to \(+\infty\), it might still have liminf \(-\infty\) if it fluctuates enough downwards along the way. However, with a positive drift, maybe such fluctuations are not strong enough?

In one-dimensional random walks, there&#x27;s a concept of whether the walk is recurrent or transient. For symmetric simple random walks (like with equal probability to go left or right), the walk is recurrent in 1D and 2D, but transient in higher dimensions. However, in our case, the walk is not symmetric; it has a drift towards the right (positive direction). So perhaps it&#x27;s transient to the right, meaning that it tends to \(+\infty\) as \( n \to \infty \), but the liminf could still be \(-\infty\) or finite.

Wait, but the liminf is the infimum of the limit points. So even if the walk goes to \(+\infty\), but it fluctuates a lot, the liminf could be finite. For example, if the walk goes to \(+\infty\) but every once in a while comes back down to some finite level, the liminf would be that finite level. But if it can go arbitrarily low infinitely often, then the liminf is \(-\infty\).

So the key is to determine whether, with probability 1, the random walk \( S_n \) will reach any negative level infinitely often. If yes, then the liminf is \(-\infty\). If no, then the liminf is some finite value.

Given the walk has a positive drift, intuition says that it might be transient to \(+\infty\), but I need to check whether it is also &quot;downward transient&quot;, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t revisit negative values infinitely often.

Alternatively, perhaps there&#x27;s a theorem that relates the liminf behavior to the drift.

Alternatively, since each step has positive drift, by the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN), \( S_n / n \) converges almost surely to \( \mathbb{E}[X_n] = 1/3 \). Therefore, \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely. Therefore, the liminf of \( S_n \) would be finite? Wait, if \( S_n \) tends to \(+\infty\), then both liminf and limsup should be \(+\infty\). But that contradicts the idea of liminf being the smallest limit point. Wait, no. If \( S_n \to +\infty \), then all limit points are \(+\infty\), so liminf is \(+\infty\). But in that case, how could liminf be \(-\infty\)?

Wait, maybe I&#x27;m confused. If the walk goes to \(+\infty\) almost surely, then with probability 1, for any large \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf would also be \(+\infty\). But that would suggest that \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

But wait, this contradicts the intuition that even with a positive drift, the walk might have fluctuations below zero. However, according to the SLLN, if the walk has a positive drift, then \( S_n \) tends to infinity almost surely, which would imply that the walk cannot go to \(-\infty\) in the liminf sense. But is that the case?

Wait, let me think again. The liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. Therefore, both liminf and limsup are infinity. Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \). But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the walk does not go to infinity almost surely? But with positive drift, I thought it does. Let me verify. For a random walk with i.i.d. steps with positive expectation, does \( S_n \to +\infty \) almost surely?

Yes, according to the SLLN, \( S_n / n \to 1/3 \) a.s., which implies that \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s. Therefore, almost every sample path goes to infinity. Therefore, for almost every path, for any \( M \), there exists \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is \(+\infty\), not \(-\infty\). So the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) \) should be 0.

But wait, maybe the liminf is different? Let me check with a simple example. Suppose we have a deterministic sequence that tends to infinity. Then its liminf is infinity. If we have a sequence that has some fluctuations but still tends to infinity, then liminf is still infinity. For example, consider \( a_n = n + (-1)^n \). This sequence goes to infinity, and the liminf is infinity. So even with oscillations, if the overall trend is to infinity, liminf and limsup both are infinity.

Therefore, if \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability that \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is zero.

But wait, maybe there&#x27;s a nuance here. Let me recall that liminf is the infimum of the set of limit points. If the walk goes to infinity, then the set of limit points is just {+infty}, so the infimum is +infty. Therefore, the liminf is +infty. So indeed, the probability in question should be 0.

But then, why is the problem asking this? Maybe my reasoning is wrong. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the walk does not go to infinity almost surely. For example, even with positive drift, perhaps there&#x27;s a chance that the walk goes to -infty? But with positive drift, the expectation of the walk is linear in n with a positive slope, and by the SLLN, it converges to +infty. So maybe the walk cannot go to -infty.

Wait, but in some cases, even with positive drift, there can be a finite probability of the walk going to -infty. Wait, but in one dimension, if the walk is transient, it either goes to +infty or -infty. Wait, no. For asymmetric random walks on the integers, if the walk is transient, then it tends to +infty or -infty with certain probabilities. But in our case, the drift is positive, so the transience is towards +infty, but perhaps there is a 0 probability of drifting to -infty.

Wait, but the question is not about lim, but liminf. So even if the walk tends to +infty, it might have liminf -infty if it fluctuates enough. But if the walk is transient with drift to +infty, maybe those downward fluctuations are not strong enough to reach arbitrary low points infinitely often.

Alternatively, let me recall that for a random walk with positive drift, the probability that it ever reaches a negative level -k is less than 1, and actually decays exponentially with k. So, the probability that the walk ever goes below -k is something like \( (q/p)^k \), where p is the probability to go right, q to go left. In our case, p=2/3, q=1/3, so \( (q/p) = 1/2 \). Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -k is \( (1/2)^k \). Therefore, the probability that the walk goes below -k infinitely often is the probability that for infinitely many k, the walk reaches -k. But by Borel-Cantelli lemma, since the sum of probabilities \( \sum (1/2)^k \) converges, by Borel-Cantelli, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, liminf is finite.

Wait, but this contradicts the previous statement from the SLLN. Wait, but according to SLLN, the walk goes to infinity, so the liminf is infinity. But here, the argument is that the walk cannot go below arbitrary negative levels infinitely often. Therefore, the liminf is not -infty. So then, why does the liminf have to be infinity?

Wait, maybe the liminf is the infimum of all the limit points. If the walk tends to infinity, then the only limit point is infinity. So liminf is infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty is 0.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a difference between liminf being -infty and the walk going to -infty. If the walk goes to -infty, then liminf would be -infty. If the walk goes to +infty, liminf is +infty. But if the walk oscillates between -infty and +infty, then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. However, in our case, since the walk has positive drift, it goes to +infty almost surely, so liminf and limsup are both +infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Wait, but let me check again. Suppose we have a simple asymmetric random walk on integers with probability p to go right and q=1-p to go left. Then, if p &gt; q, the walk is transient to the right, meaning that it tends to +infty a.s. If p &lt; q, it tends to -infty a.s. If p = q, it&#x27;s recurrent.

In our case, p=2/3 &gt; q=1/3, so the walk is transient to +infty. Therefore, with probability 1, \( S_n \to +\infty \). Therefore, \( \liminf S_n = +\infty \) a.s., so the probability \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the liminf in another way. Even if the walk goes to +infty, maybe it can have liminf -infty if it has infinitely many drops to -infty. But if the walk tends to +infty, then after some finite time, it never goes below a certain level. Therefore, the liminf would be the infimum of the sequence from that point on, which is increasing to infinity, so liminf is infinity.

But perhaps the walk can go to +infty but still have liminf -infty? Wait, no. If the walk goes to +infty, then for any M, there exists N such that for all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= M. Therefore, the liminf is at least M. Since M can be as large as we want, liminf is infinity. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty in that case.

So then, the answer is 0.

But wait, let&#x27;s see. Suppose the walk is transient to the right. Then, with probability 1, S_n tends to +infty. Therefore, liminf S_n = +infty a.s. So indeed, the probability that liminf S_n = -infty is 0. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me? Let me consider another angle.

Suppose that even though the walk tends to +infty, maybe there are infinitely many times when it goes below 0. But even if that&#x27;s the case, the liminf would be the infimum of those points. If the walk goes below 0 infinitely often, but the extent to which it goes below 0 is bounded, then liminf would be some finite negative number. However, if it can go below any negative integer infinitely often, then the liminf would be -infty.

But in our case, with positive drift, is it possible that the walk visits 0 infinitely often? If it&#x27;s transient to the right, then it can only visit 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is also finite.

Wait, but transience to the right means that the walk eventually stays on the right side, right? So, for some N, all n &gt;= N, S_n &gt;= 0. But is that the case?

Wait, actually, transience to the right means that the walk tends to +infty, but it might revisit the left side (negative numbers) infinitely often. Wait, but if the walk has a positive drift, can it still go below 0 infinitely often?

Hmm, this is a key point. Let me recall that in one dimension, for an asymmetric random walk with drift, whether it is transient or not is determined by the direction of the drift. If the drift is positive, then the walk tends to +infty a.s. But does that mean that it can&#x27;t go below 0 infinitely often?

No, actually, even with a positive drift, the walk might still cross below 0 infinitely often. For example, consider the case where the walk has a small positive drift. Then, there&#x27;s a positive probability that it will cross below 0 infinitely often. Wait, but actually, in the case of asymmetric random walks on integers, starting at 0, with p &gt; q, the walk is transient to +infty, which means that it visits each state finitely many times. Therefore, it can only cross 0 finitely many times. Therefore, the number of times it goes below 0 is finite.

Wait, this is a crucial point. Let me recall that in a transient random walk to the right, the number of times the walk returns to the origin is finite. Therefore, the walk can only cross below 0 finitely many times. Therefore, after some finite time, the walk remains positive. Therefore, the liminf would be the minimum value achieved by the walk after that finite time, which is positive, and since the walk tends to infinity, the liminf would be infinity. Therefore, the probability that liminf is -infty would be 0.

Alternatively, maybe in higher dimensions, but in 1D, once the walk is transient, it can&#x27;t oscillate between positive and negative infinitely often.

Wait, let me check with a concrete example. Suppose we have a biased random walk on the integers with p=2/3 and q=1/3 starting at 0. What is the probability that the walk ever reaches -1?

In general, for a biased random walk starting at 0, the probability of ever reaching -1 can be computed. Let me denote this probability as \( \rho \).

In the Gambler&#x27;s ruin problem, the probability of ruin starting from 0, with absorbing barriers at 0 and N, but here we have an absorbing barrier at -1 and the other at infinity. Wait, but actually, if we want the probability of ever reaching -1 starting from 0, with probability p=2/3 of moving right and q=1/3 of moving left, then the probability \( \rho \) satisfies the equation:

\( \rho = q + p \rho^2 \)

This is because starting from 0, with probability q=1/3, we go to -1 and are ruined, and with probability p=2/3, we go to +1, and then we need to reach -1 from +1, which is equivalent to the probability \( \rho^2 \) (since we have to go from +1 to 0 and then from 0 to -1, each with probability \( \rho \)).

Therefore, solving the equation \( \rho = 1/3 + (2/3) \rho^2 \).

Multiply both sides by 3: \( 3\rho = 1 + 2\rho^2 \), which becomes \( 2\rho^2 - 3\rho + 1 = 0 \).

Solving the quadratic equation: \( \rho = [3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 8}]/4 = [3 \pm 1]/4 \), so roots are 1 and 1/2.

Since we are looking for the probability of ruin, which is less than 1 (because the drift is positive), we take \( \rho = 1/2 \).

Therefore, the probability that the walk ever reaches -1 is 1/2. Therefore, the probability that it ever reaches -k would be \( (1/2)^k \), as each subsequent level would require another independent ruin.

But in this case, the walk has a positive probability of eventually going to any negative level, but the probability of going to -k is \( (1/2)^k \), which is summable over k. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, since the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mathbb{P}( \text{reach } -k ) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (1/2)^k = 1 \), which converges. Wait, but Borel-Cantelli says that if the sum of probabilities is finite, then the probability that infinitely many of the events occur is 0. But here, the events are &quot;the walk reaches -k&quot;, but these are not independent events.

Wait, but actually, each time the walk reaches -k, it implies that it has reached -1, -2, ..., -k. So the events are nested. Therefore, the event that the walk reaches -k infinitely often is equivalent to the walk going to -infty. But since the probability of reaching -k is \( (1/2)^k \), the probability that it reaches -k for infinitely many k is the limit as k approaches infinity of \( (1/2)^k \), which is 0. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli lemma (the first one), since the sum of probabilities is finite, the probability that infinitely many of these events occur is 0. Therefore, the walk does not go to -infty. Therefore, the liminf cannot be -infty.

Alternatively, even if the walk has a positive drift, can it still have liminf -infty?

Wait, if the walk goes to +infty a.s., then the liminf is +infty. If the walk had oscillating behavior, like in the null recurrent case (symmetric walk), then liminf is -infty and limsup is +infty. But in our case, the walk is transient to +infty, so it cannot have liminf -infty.

Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me check another approach. Let&#x27;s consider the events \( A_k = \{ S_n \leq -k \text{ infinitely often} \} \). Then, \( \liminf S_n = -\infty \) is equivalent to \( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k \).

We need to compute \( \mathbb{P}( \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty A_k ) \).

By the continuity of probability measures, this is the limit as \( k \to \infty \) of \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

But \( A_{k+1} \subseteq A_k \), so the sequence \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \) is non-increasing.

Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(A_k) \).

We know from the previous computation that \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \leq \mathbb{P}( \text{ever reaching } -k ) = (1/2)^k \).

But as \( k \to \infty \), \( (1/2)^k \to 0 \). Therefore, the probability \( \mathbb{P}(A_k) \to 0 \). Therefore, \( \mathbb{P}(\liminf S_n = -\infty) = 0 \).

Alternatively, another way is to note that since \( S_n \to +\infty \) a.s., then for almost every sample path, there exists some integer \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq 0 \). Therefore, the liminf is at least 0. But actually, since \( S_n \to +\infty \), for any \( M &gt; 0 \), there exists \( K \) such that for all \( n \geq K \), \( S_n \geq M \). Therefore, the liminf is infinity.

Therefore, the probability that the liminf is -infty is 0.

So, after all this reasoning, I think the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given a sequence \((X_{n})_{n \geq 1}\) of i.i.d. random variables where \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = -1) = \frac{1}{3}\) and \(\mathbb{P}(X_{n} = 1) = \frac{2}{3}\), we need to determine the value of \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty)\) for the random walk \(S_{n} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} X_{k}\) starting at \(S_{0} = 0\).

1. **Expectation and Drift**:
   - The expectation of each step \(X_n\) is \(\mathbb{E}[X_n] = \frac{1}{3}\). This positive drift indicates a tendency towards \(+\infty\).

2. **Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)**:
   - By the SLLN, \(\frac{S_n}{n} \to \frac{1}{3}\) almost surely. This implies \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely.

3. **Liminf Behavior**:
   - If \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, then for any large \(M\), there exists \(N\) such that for all \(n \geq N\), \(S_n \geq M\). Therefore, both \(\liminf S_n\) and \(\limsup S_n\) are \(+\infty\).

4. **Probability Analysis**:
   - The liminf of \(S_n\) being \(-\infty\) would require the walk to visit arbitrarily low levels infinitely often. However, due to the positive drift, the walk tends to \(+\infty\) almost surely, making such events impossible.
   - Using the Borel-Cantelli lemma, the probability of the walk reaching any negative level \(-k\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k\), which is summable. Hence, the probability of infinitely many such events is 0.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since \(S_n \to +\infty\) almost surely, the liminf of \(S_n\) is also \(+\infty\). Therefore, \(\mathbb{P}(\liminf S_{n} = -\infty) = 0\).

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem here: If a function u solves the equation Δu = f(|x|) in the unit ball B₁ ⊂ ℝⁿ, where f is a continuous function from [0, ∞) to ℝ, must u(x) necessarily be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v? Hmm, interesting. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, let me recall what Δu means. That&#x27;s the Laplacian of u, right? So in n dimensions, the Laplacian operator is the sum of the second partial derivatives with respect to each coordinate. So Δu = ∂²u/∂x₁² + ∂²u/∂x₂² + ... + ∂²u/∂xₙ². 

Now, the equation given is Δu = f(|x|). The function f depends only on the radial distance |x| from the origin. So the right-hand side of the equation is radially symmetric. The question is whether the solution u must also be radially symmetric, i.e., expressible as v(|x|). 

I remember that for certain PDEs with radial symmetry in the equation or the domain, solutions can inherit that symmetry. For example, in electrostatics, the potential due to a spherically symmetric charge distribution is also spherically symmetric. But I need to verify if this is always the case here, or if there might be solutions that aren&#x27;t radial.

The domain here is the unit ball, which is a radially symmetric domain. The equation has a radially symmetric forcing term f(|x|). So maybe the solution must also be radially symmetric. But how can I be sure?

One approach might be to use the method of separation of variables or to look for solutions in polar coordinates. Since the problem is set in the unit ball, it might be helpful to express the Laplacian in spherical coordinates. In spherical coordinates, the Laplacian operator for a radial function v(r) simplifies significantly. Specifically, for a radial function v(r), where r = |x|, the Laplacian becomes Δv = v&#x27;&#x27;(r) + (n-1)/r * v&#x27;(r). So if u is radial, then Δu would just be a function of r, which matches the right-hand side f(r). 

But the question is whether any solution u must be radial. Suppose there exists a non-radial solution. Then, by some symmetry argument, maybe we can show that such a solution cannot exist. Alternatively, perhaps by the uniqueness of solutions to the Poisson equation with certain boundary conditions, the solution must be radial. However, the problem statement here doesn&#x27;t mention boundary conditions. Wait, that&#x27;s a point. The equation is Δu = f(|x|) in B₁, but no boundary conditions are specified. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that u is a solution without any specific boundary conditions, or perhaps considering the general case. But in PDEs, uniqueness usually comes with boundary conditions. Without boundary conditions, there might be multiple solutions. For example, you can add any harmonic function (satisfying Δu = 0) to a particular solution and get another solution. So if there&#x27;s a non-radial harmonic function, then adding it to a radial solution would give a non-radial solution. But harmonic functions on the unit ball don&#x27;t necessarily have to be radial. For instance, in 3D, the function x (or y, z) is harmonic but not radial. 

But wait, in that case, if we have a Poisson equation Δu = f(|x|) with no boundary conditions specified, then solutions are not unique. Therefore, there might exist both radial and non-radial solutions. But the question is phrased as &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|)&quot;, i.e., is every solution necessarily radial? If there exists a non-radial solution, then the answer is no. 

But maybe the problem is assuming some implicit boundary conditions, like Dirichlet or Neumann? Since the unit ball is a bounded domain, perhaps the question is considering solutions in a certain class, like classical solutions, but without boundary conditions, the answer might not be necessarily radial. However, maybe even without boundary conditions, the equation Δu = f(|x|) forces u to be radial. 

Wait, let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have two solutions u₁ and u₂ of Δu = f(|x|). Then their difference w = u₁ - u₂ satisfies Δw = 0. So w is harmonic. If we can show that all harmonic functions in B₁ must be radial, then all solutions would be radial. But harmonic functions are not necessarily radial. For example, in 2D, the real part of z^n for integer n is a harmonic function which is not radial. Therefore, unless we impose some boundary conditions like radial symmetry, harmonic functions can break the radial symmetry. 

Therefore, without boundary conditions, the solution u is not unique, and you can have non-radial solutions by adding non-radial harmonic functions. Therefore, the answer would be no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). 

But wait, hold on. Maybe the problem is posed in such a way that u is a solution without any specific mention of boundary conditions, but perhaps considering distributional solutions or something else. Wait, but even distributional solutions to Δu = f(|x|) would not be unique without boundary conditions. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the unique solution under certain boundary conditions, like Dirichlet conditions. For example, if you impose u = g on the boundary ∂B₁, then if g is radial, the solution would be radial. But if g is not radial, then the solution wouldn&#x27;t be radial. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify boundary conditions. 

Wait, let me check the original problem statement again: &quot;If u solves the equation Δu = f(|x|) in the unit ball B₁ ⊂ ℝⁿ, where f: [0, ∞) → ℝ is a continuous function, must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v?&quot; 

So the problem is just saying that u is a solution (without any specific boundary conditions). So given that, then as we discussed, solutions are not unique. Therefore, there can be non-radial solutions. So the answer would be no. 

But let me verify this with an example. Let&#x27;s take n=2 for simplicity. Suppose f(|x|) = 1, so Δu = 1 in the unit disk. A particular solution would be radial. For example, u_p(r) = (r²)/4. Because in polar coordinates, the Laplacian is u&#x27;&#x27; + (1/r) u&#x27;, so if u_p = (r²)/4, then u_p&#x27; = r/2, u_p&#x27;&#x27; = 1/2, so Δu_p = 1/2 + (1/r)(r/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which matches f(|x|)=1. So that&#x27;s a radial solution. 

However, we can add any harmonic function to u_p and still have a solution. For example, take a harmonic function like h(x, y) = x. Then u = u_p + h would be a solution: Δ(u_p + h) = Δu_p + Δh = 1 + 0 = 1. But u = (r²)/4 + x is not radial because x = r cosθ in polar coordinates, so u depends on θ as well. Therefore, this u is not expressible as a function of r alone. Therefore, such a solution is non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer is no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). There exist solutions that are not radially symmetric. 

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering only bounded solutions or solutions with some regularity? But even so, in the example above, x is smooth and bounded in the unit ball. So even with smoothness, we can have non-radial solutions. 

Alternatively, perhaps if the problem had specified boundary conditions like u = 0 on the boundary, then maybe the solution would have to be radial. Let&#x27;s check that. Suppose we have Δu = f(|x|) with u = 0 on ∂B₁. Then, is the solution necessarily radial? 

In that case, maybe yes. Because the equation and the boundary condition are both radially symmetric, so by symmetry, the solution should also be radial. Let me recall the uniqueness of solutions for the Dirichlet problem. If you have a unique solution, and if the problem is invariant under rotations, then the solution must also be invariant under rotations, hence radial. 

So in the case where boundary conditions are specified and are radial, then the solution must be radial. But in the original problem, the user hasn&#x27;t specified any boundary conditions. Therefore, without boundary conditions, there are infinitely many solutions, some of which are non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether boundary conditions are imposed. Since the problem statement does not specify any boundary conditions, we have to consider the equation Δu = f(|x|) in B₁ without any restrictions on the boundary. Hence, solutions are not unique, and non-radial solutions exist. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). The answer is no. 

But wait, the problem is stated as &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|)&quot;, i.e., is it necessary that all solutions are radial? Since we can exhibit a non-radial solution, the answer is no. 

However, to be thorough, let me check another example. Suppose f(|x|) = 0. Then the equation is Δu = 0, harmonic functions in the unit ball. There are plenty of non-radial harmonic functions, like the coordinate functions x₁, x₂, etc. So even in the case f ≡ 0, which is a special case of the problem here, there are non-radial solutions. Hence, the answer is indeed no. 

Therefore, unless there are specific boundary conditions imposed (which there aren&#x27;t in the problem statement), the solution does not have to be radial. 

So the final answer is no, u(x) need not be expressible as v(|x|). Therefore, the answer is \boxed{No}. Wait, but the instructions say to put the final answer within \boxed{} and typically for yes/no questions in math, it might expect \boxed{\text{No}} or \boxed{\text{Yes}}. However, looking back, maybe the original problem is from a source where answers are boxed as statements. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the user wrote: &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v? Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.&quot;

But in many math problem contexts, especially in PDEs, when they ask &quot;must u be expressible...&quot;, the answer is typically &quot;No&quot; because without boundary conditions, you can add non-radial harmonics. But maybe the question is trickier. Wait, is there a uniqueness theorem I&#x27;m missing here?

Wait, another thought: if the problem is in the unit ball and f is radial, perhaps even without boundary conditions, the equation Δu = f(|x|) only has radial solutions? But that can&#x27;t be, as we just constructed a non-radial solution by adding a non-radial harmonic function. So unless there is a condition that restricts solutions to be radial, the answer is no. 

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, when you say &quot;solves the equation&quot; in the entire ball, maybe they consider distributional solutions or weak solutions with certain integrability conditions. But even so, the example I have in mind, adding x to a radial solution, would still be a weak solution, and x is in L²(B₁), for example. So even in Sobolev spaces, you can have non-radial solutions. 

Therefore, unless there&#x27;s a hidden assumption, the answer is no. So I think the answer is no, and the box should be \boxed{No}. But let me check standard references or theorems.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: if a function satisfies Δu = 0 in a radially symmetric domain and u is radial, then u is radial. Wait, that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, if the equation is rotationally invariant and the domain is rotationally invariant, then for each solution, its rotations are also solutions. Therefore, by averaging over rotations, you can obtain a radial solution. But that doesn&#x27;t mean all solutions are radial. 

Alternatively, the Poisson equation with radial inhomogeneity f(|x|) might have a radial particular solution, and then the homogeneous solutions (harmonic functions) can be added. Since harmonic functions can be non-radial, the general solution need not be radial. Therefore, the answer is no. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that u does not have to be radial. So the final answer is \boxed{No}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the equation \(\Delta u = f(|x|)\) in the unit ball \(B_1 \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) where \(f: [0, \infty) \to \mathbb{R}\) is a continuous function, we need to determine if the solution \(u(x)\) must be expressible as \(v(|x|)\) for some function \(v\).

1. **Laplacian in Spherical Coordinates**: For a radial function \(v(r)\), the Laplacian simplifies to \(\Delta v = v&#x27;&#x27;(r) + \frac{n-1}{r} v&#x27;(r)\). This shows that if \(u\) is radial, the Laplacian will be a function of \(r\) alone, matching \(f(|x|)\).

2. **Non-Uniqueness of Solutions**: Without boundary conditions, solutions to the Poisson equation \(\Delta u = f(|x|)\) are not unique. Any harmonic function (satisfying \(\Delta u = 0\)) can be added to a particular solution to yield another solution. Harmonic functions in the unit ball do not have to be radial (e.g., \(x_1, x_2, \ldots\) in \(\mathbb{R}^n\)).

3. **Example with Non-Radial Solution**: Consider \(f(|x|) = 1\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\). A particular solution is \(u_p(r) = \frac{r^2}{4}\), which is radial. Adding a non-radial harmonic function like \(h(x, y) = x\) results in a non-radial solution \(u = \frac{r^2}{4} + x\), which still satisfies \(\Delta u = 1\).

4. **Conclusion**: Since non-radial harmonic functions can be added to radial solutions, and harmonic functions are not necessarily radial, the solution \(u(x)\) does not have to be radial. The lack of boundary conditions allows for non-unique solutions, some of which are non-radial.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{No}\).          </p>

So that&#x27;s a radial solution. 

However, we can add any harmonic function to u_p and still have a solution. For example, take a harmonic function like h(x, y) = x. Then u = u_p + h would be a solution: Δ(u_p + h) = Δu_p + Δh = 1 + 0 = 1. But u = (r²)/4 + x is not radial because x = r cosθ in polar coordinates, so u depends on θ as well.

First, let me recall what Δu means. That&#x27;s the Laplacian of u, right? So in n dimensions, the Laplacian operator is the sum of the second partial derivatives with respect to each coordinate. So Δu = ∂²u/∂x₁² + ∂²u/∂x₂² + ... + ∂²u/∂xₙ². 

Now, the equation given is Δu = f(|x|). The function f depends only on the radial distance |x| from the origin. So the right-hand side of the equation is radially symmetric. The question is whether the solution u must also be radially symmetric, i.e., expressible as v(|x|). 

I remember that for certain PDEs with radial symmetry in the equation or the domain, solutions can inherit that symmetry. For example, in electrostatics, the potential due to a spherically symmetric charge distribution is also spherically symmetric. But I need to verify if this is always the case here, or if there might be solutions that aren&#x27;t radial.

The domain here is the unit ball, which is a radially symmetric domain. The equation has a radially symmetric forcing term f(|x|). So maybe the solution must also be radially symmetric. But how can I be sure?

One approach might be to use the method of separation of variables or to look for solutions in polar coordinates. Since the problem is set in the unit ball, it might be helpful to express the Laplacian in spherical coordinates. In spherical coordinates, the Laplacian operator for a radial function v(r) simplifies significantly. Specifically, for a radial function v(r), where r = |x|, the Laplacian becomes Δv = v&#x27;&#x27;(r) + (n-1)/r * v&#x27;(r). So if u is radial, then Δu would just be a function of r, which matches the right-hand side f(r). 

But the question is whether any solution u must be radial. Suppose there exists a non-radial solution. Then, by some symmetry argument, maybe we can show that such a solution cannot exist. Alternatively, perhaps by the uniqueness of solutions to the Poisson equation with certain boundary conditions, the solution must be radial. However, the problem statement here doesn&#x27;t mention boundary conditions. Wait, that&#x27;s a point. The equation is Δu = f(|x|) in B₁, but no boundary conditions are specified. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that u is a solution without any specific boundary conditions, or perhaps considering the general case. But in PDEs, uniqueness usually comes with boundary conditions. Without boundary conditions, there might be multiple solutions. For example, you can add any harmonic function (satisfying Δu = 0) to a particular solution and get another solution. So if there&#x27;s a non-radial harmonic function, then adding it to a radial solution would give a non-radial solution. But harmonic functions on the unit ball don&#x27;t necessarily have to be radial. For instance, in 3D, the function x (or y, z) is harmonic but not radial. 

But wait, in that case, if we have a Poisson equation Δu = f(|x|) with no boundary conditions specified, then solutions are not unique. Therefore, there might exist both radial and non-radial solutions. But the question is phrased as &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|)&quot;, i.e., is every solution necessarily radial? If there exists a non-radial solution, then the answer is no. 

But maybe the problem is assuming some implicit boundary conditions, like Dirichlet or Neumann? Since the unit ball is a bounded domain, perhaps the question is considering solutions in a certain class, like classical solutions, but without boundary conditions, the answer might not be necessarily radial. However, maybe even without boundary conditions, the equation Δu = f(|x|) forces u to be radial. 

Wait, let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have two solutions u₁ and u₂ of Δu = f(|x|). Then their difference w = u₁ - u₂ satisfies Δw = 0. So w is harmonic. If we can show that all harmonic functions in B₁ must be radial, then all solutions would be radial. But harmonic functions are not necessarily radial. For example, in 2D, the real part of z^n for integer n is a harmonic function which is not radial. Therefore, unless we impose some boundary conditions like radial symmetry, harmonic functions can break the radial symmetry. 

Therefore, without boundary conditions, the solution u is not unique, and you can have non-radial solutions by adding non-radial harmonic functions. Therefore, the answer would be no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). 

But wait, hold on. Maybe the problem is posed in such a way that u is a solution without any specific mention of boundary conditions, but perhaps considering distributional solutions or something else. Wait, but even distributional solutions to Δu = f(|x|) would not be unique without boundary conditions. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the unique solution under certain boundary conditions, like Dirichlet conditions. For example, if you impose u = g on the boundary ∂B₁, then if g is radial, the solution would be radial. But if g is not radial, then the solution wouldn&#x27;t be radial. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify boundary conditions. 

Wait, let me check the original problem statement again: &quot;If u solves the equation Δu = f(|x|) in the unit ball B₁ ⊂ ℝⁿ, where f: [0, ∞) → ℝ is a continuous function, must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v?&quot; 

So the problem is just saying that u is a solution (without any specific boundary conditions). So given that, then as we discussed, solutions are not unique. Therefore, there can be non-radial solutions. So the answer would be no. 

But let me verify this with an example. Let&#x27;s take n=2 for simplicity. Suppose f(|x|) = 1, so Δu = 1 in the unit disk. A particular solution would be radial. For example, u_p(r) = (r²)/4. Because in polar coordinates, the Laplacian is u&#x27;&#x27; + (1/r) u&#x27;, so if u_p = (r²)/4, then u_p&#x27; = r/2, u_p&#x27;&#x27; = 1/2, so Δu_p = 1/2 + (1/r)(r/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which matches f(|x|)=1. So that&#x27;s a radial solution. 

However, we can add any harmonic function to u_p and still have a solution. For example, take a harmonic function like h(x, y) = x. Then u = u_p + h would be a solution: Δ(u_p + h) = Δu_p + Δh = 1 + 0 = 1. But u = (r²)/4 + x is not radial because x = r cosθ in polar coordinates, so u depends on θ as well. Therefore, this u is not expressible as a function of r alone. Therefore, such a solution is non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer is no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). There exist solutions that are not radially symmetric. 

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering only bounded solutions or solutions with some regularity? But even so, in the example above, x is smooth and bounded in the unit ball. So even with smoothness, we can have non-radial solutions. 

Alternatively, perhaps if the problem had specified boundary conditions like u = 0 on the boundary, then maybe the solution would have to be radial. Let&#x27;s check that. Suppose we have Δu = f(|x|) with u = 0 on ∂B₁. Then, is the solution necessarily radial? 

In that case, maybe yes. Because the equation and the boundary condition are both radially symmetric, so by symmetry, the solution should also be radial. Let me recall the uniqueness of solutions for the Dirichlet problem. If you have a unique solution, and if the problem is invariant under rotations, then the solution must also be invariant under rotations, hence radial. 

So in the case where boundary conditions are specified and are radial, then the solution must be radial. But in the original problem, the user hasn&#x27;t specified any boundary conditions. Therefore, without boundary conditions, there are infinitely many solutions, some of which are non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether boundary conditions are imposed. Since the problem statement does not specify any boundary conditions, we have to consider the equation Δu = f(|x|) in B₁ without any restrictions on the boundary. Hence, solutions are not unique, and non-radial solutions exist. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). The answer is no. 

But wait, the problem is stated as &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|)&quot;, i.e., is it necessary that all solutions are radial? Since we can exhibit a non-radial solution, the answer is no. 

However, to be thorough, let me check another example. Suppose f(|x|) = 0. Then the equation is Δu = 0, harmonic functions in the unit ball. There are plenty of non-radial harmonic functions, like the coordinate functions x₁, x₂, etc. So even in the case f ≡ 0, which is a special case of the problem here, there are non-radial solutions. Hence, the answer is indeed no. 

Therefore, unless there are specific boundary conditions imposed (which there aren&#x27;t in the problem statement), the solution does not have to be radial. 

So the final answer is no, u(x) need not be expressible as v(|x|). Therefore, the answer is \boxed{No}. Wait, but the instructions say to put the final answer within \boxed{} and typically for yes/no questions in math, it might expect \boxed{\text{No}} or \boxed{\text{Yes}}. However, looking back, maybe the original problem is from a source where answers are boxed as statements. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the user wrote: &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v? Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.&quot;

But in many math problem contexts, especially in PDEs, when they ask &quot;must u be expressible...&quot;, the answer is typically &quot;No&quot; because without boundary conditions, you can add non-radial harmonics. But maybe the question is trickier. Wait, is there a uniqueness theorem I&#x27;m missing here?

Wait, another thought: if the problem is in the unit ball and f is radial, perhaps even without boundary conditions, the equation Δu = f(|x|) only has radial solutions? But that can&#x27;t be, as we just constructed a non-radial solution by adding a non-radial harmonic function. So unless there is a condition that restricts solutions to be radial, the answer is no. 

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, when you say &quot;solves the equation&quot; in the entire ball, maybe they consider distributional solutions or weak solutions with certain integrability conditions. But even so, the example I have in mind, adding x to a radial solution, would still be a weak solution, and x is in L²(B₁), for example. So even in Sobolev spaces, you can have non-radial solutions. 

Therefore, unless there&#x27;s a hidden assumption, the answer is no. So I think the answer is no, and the box should be \boxed{No}. But let me check standard references or theorems.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: if a function satisfies Δu = 0 in a radially symmetric domain and u is radial, then u is radial. Wait, that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, if the equation is rotationally invariant and the domain is rotationally invariant, then for each solution, its rotations are also solutions. Therefore, by averaging over rotations, you can obtain a radial solution. But that doesn&#x27;t mean all solutions are radial. 

Alternatively, the Poisson equation with radial inhomogeneity f(|x|) might have a radial particular solution, and then the homogeneous solutions (harmonic functions) can be added. Since harmonic functions can be non-radial, the general solution need not be radial. Therefore, the answer is no. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that u does not have to be radial. So the final answer is \boxed{No}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the equation \(\Delta u = f(|x|)\) in the unit ball \(B_1 \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) where \(f: [0, \infty) \to \mathbb{R}\) is a continuous function, we need to determine if the solution \(u(x)\) must be expressible as \(v(|x|)\) for some function \(v\).

1. **Laplacian in Spherical Coordinates**: For a radial function \(v(r)\), the Laplacian simplifies to \(\Delta v = v&#x27;&#x27;(r) + \frac{n-1}{r} v&#x27;(r)\). This shows that if \(u\) is radial, the Laplacian will be a function of \(r\) alone, matching \(f(|x|)\).

2. **Non-Uniqueness of Solutions**: Without boundary conditions, solutions to the Poisson equation \(\Delta u = f(|x|)\) are not unique. Any harmonic function (satisfying \(\Delta u = 0\)) can be added to a particular solution to yield another solution. Harmonic functions in the unit ball do not have to be radial (e.g., \(x_1, x_2, \ldots\) in \(\mathbb{R}^n\)).

3. **Example with Non-Radial Solution**: Consider \(f(|x|) = 1\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\). A particular solution is \(u_p(r) = \frac{r^2}{4}\), which is radial. Adding a non-radial harmonic function like \(h(x, y) = x\) results in a non-radial solution \(u = \frac{r^2}{4} + x\), which still satisfies \(\Delta u = 1\).

4. **Conclusion**: Since non-radial harmonic functions can be added to radial solutions, and harmonic functions are not necessarily radial, the solution \(u(x)\) does not have to be radial. The lack of boundary conditions allows for non-unique solutions, some of which are non-radial.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{No}\).          </p>

So that&#x27;s a radial solution. 

However, we can add any harmonic function to u_p and still have a solution. For example, take a harmonic function like h(x, y) = x. Then u = u_p + h would be a solution: Δ(u_p + h) = Δu_p + Δh = 1 + 0 = 1. But u = (r²)/4 + x is not radial because x = r cosθ in polar coordinates, so u depends on θ as well.

The domain here is the unit ball, which is a radially symmetric domain. The equation has a radially symmetric forcing term f(|x|). So maybe the solution must also be radially symmetric. But how can I be sure?

One approach might be to use the method of separation of variables or to look for solutions in polar coordinates. Since the problem is set in the unit ball, it might be helpful to express the Laplacian in spherical coordinates. In spherical coordinates, the Laplacian operator for a radial function v(r) simplifies significantly. Specifically, for a radial function v(r), where r = |x|, the Laplacian becomes Δv = v&#x27;&#x27;(r) + (n-1)/r * v&#x27;(r). So if u is radial, then Δu would just be a function of r, which matches the right-hand side f(r). 

But the question is whether any solution u must be radial. Suppose there exists a non-radial solution. Then, by some symmetry argument, maybe we can show that such a solution cannot exist. Alternatively, perhaps by the uniqueness of solutions to the Poisson equation with certain boundary conditions, the solution must be radial. However, the problem statement here doesn&#x27;t mention boundary conditions. Wait, that&#x27;s a point. The equation is Δu = f(|x|) in B₁, but no boundary conditions are specified. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that u is a solution without any specific boundary conditions, or perhaps considering the general case. But in PDEs, uniqueness usually comes with boundary conditions. Without boundary conditions, there might be multiple solutions. For example, you can add any harmonic function (satisfying Δu = 0) to a particular solution and get another solution. So if there&#x27;s a non-radial harmonic function, then adding it to a radial solution would give a non-radial solution. But harmonic functions on the unit ball don&#x27;t necessarily have to be radial. For instance, in 3D, the function x (or y, z) is harmonic but not radial. 

But wait, in that case, if we have a Poisson equation Δu = f(|x|) with no boundary conditions specified, then solutions are not unique. Therefore, there might exist both radial and non-radial solutions. But the question is phrased as &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|)&quot;, i.e., is every solution necessarily radial? If there exists a non-radial solution, then the answer is no. 

But maybe the problem is assuming some implicit boundary conditions, like Dirichlet or Neumann? Since the unit ball is a bounded domain, perhaps the question is considering solutions in a certain class, like classical solutions, but without boundary conditions, the answer might not be necessarily radial. However, maybe even without boundary conditions, the equation Δu = f(|x|) forces u to be radial. 

Wait, let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have two solutions u₁ and u₂ of Δu = f(|x|). Then their difference w = u₁ - u₂ satisfies Δw = 0. So w is harmonic. If we can show that all harmonic functions in B₁ must be radial, then all solutions would be radial. But harmonic functions are not necessarily radial. For example, in 2D, the real part of z^n for integer n is a harmonic function which is not radial. Therefore, unless we impose some boundary conditions like radial symmetry, harmonic functions can break the radial symmetry. 

Therefore, without boundary conditions, the solution u is not unique, and you can have non-radial solutions by adding non-radial harmonic functions. Therefore, the answer would be no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). 

But wait, hold on. Maybe the problem is posed in such a way that u is a solution without any specific mention of boundary conditions, but perhaps considering distributional solutions or something else. Wait, but even distributional solutions to Δu = f(|x|) would not be unique without boundary conditions. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the unique solution under certain boundary conditions, like Dirichlet conditions. For example, if you impose u = g on the boundary ∂B₁, then if g is radial, the solution would be radial. But if g is not radial, then the solution wouldn&#x27;t be radial. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify boundary conditions. 

Wait, let me check the original problem statement again: &quot;If u solves the equation Δu = f(|x|) in the unit ball B₁ ⊂ ℝⁿ, where f: [0, ∞) → ℝ is a continuous function, must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v?&quot; 

So the problem is just saying that u is a solution (without any specific boundary conditions). So given that, then as we discussed, solutions are not unique. Therefore, there can be non-radial solutions. So the answer would be no. 

But let me verify this with an example. Let&#x27;s take n=2 for simplicity. Suppose f(|x|) = 1, so Δu = 1 in the unit disk. A particular solution would be radial. For example, u_p(r) = (r²)/4. Because in polar coordinates, the Laplacian is u&#x27;&#x27; + (1/r) u&#x27;, so if u_p = (r²)/4, then u_p&#x27; = r/2, u_p&#x27;&#x27; = 1/2, so Δu_p = 1/2 + (1/r)(r/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which matches f(|x|)=1. So that&#x27;s a radial solution. 

However, we can add any harmonic function to u_p and still have a solution. For example, take a harmonic function like h(x, y) = x. Then u = u_p + h would be a solution: Δ(u_p + h) = Δu_p + Δh = 1 + 0 = 1. But u = (r²)/4 + x is not radial because x = r cosθ in polar coordinates, so u depends on θ as well. Therefore, this u is not expressible as a function of r alone. Therefore, such a solution is non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer is no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). There exist solutions that are not radially symmetric. 

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering only bounded solutions or solutions with some regularity? But even so, in the example above, x is smooth and bounded in the unit ball. So even with smoothness, we can have non-radial solutions. 

Alternatively, perhaps if the problem had specified boundary conditions like u = 0 on the boundary, then maybe the solution would have to be radial. Let&#x27;s check that. Suppose we have Δu = f(|x|) with u = 0 on ∂B₁. Then, is the solution necessarily radial? 

In that case, maybe yes. Because the equation and the boundary condition are both radially symmetric, so by symmetry, the solution should also be radial. Let me recall the uniqueness of solutions for the Dirichlet problem. If you have a unique solution, and if the problem is invariant under rotations, then the solution must also be invariant under rotations, hence radial. 

So in the case where boundary conditions are specified and are radial, then the solution must be radial. But in the original problem, the user hasn&#x27;t specified any boundary conditions. Therefore, without boundary conditions, there are infinitely many solutions, some of which are non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether boundary conditions are imposed. Since the problem statement does not specify any boundary conditions, we have to consider the equation Δu = f(|x|) in B₁ without any restrictions on the boundary. Hence, solutions are not unique, and non-radial solutions exist. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). The answer is no. 

But wait, the problem is stated as &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|)&quot;, i.e., is it necessary that all solutions are radial? Since we can exhibit a non-radial solution, the answer is no. 

However, to be thorough, let me check another example. Suppose f(|x|) = 0. Then the equation is Δu = 0, harmonic functions in the unit ball. There are plenty of non-radial harmonic functions, like the coordinate functions x₁, x₂, etc. So even in the case f ≡ 0, which is a special case of the problem here, there are non-radial solutions. Hence, the answer is indeed no. 

Therefore, unless there are specific boundary conditions imposed (which there aren&#x27;t in the problem statement), the solution does not have to be radial. 

So the final answer is no, u(x) need not be expressible as v(|x|). Therefore, the answer is \boxed{No}. Wait, but the instructions say to put the final answer within \boxed{} and typically for yes/no questions in math, it might expect \boxed{\text{No}} or \boxed{\text{Yes}}. However, looking back, maybe the original problem is from a source where answers are boxed as statements. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the user wrote: &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v? Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.&quot;

But in many math problem contexts, especially in PDEs, when they ask &quot;must u be expressible...&quot;, the answer is typically &quot;No&quot; because without boundary conditions, you can add non-radial harmonics. But maybe the question is trickier. Wait, is there a uniqueness theorem I&#x27;m missing here?

Wait, another thought: if the problem is in the unit ball and f is radial, perhaps even without boundary conditions, the equation Δu = f(|x|) only has radial solutions? But that can&#x27;t be, as we just constructed a non-radial solution by adding a non-radial harmonic function. So unless there is a condition that restricts solutions to be radial, the answer is no. 

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, when you say &quot;solves the equation&quot; in the entire ball, maybe they consider distributional solutions or weak solutions with certain integrability conditions. But even so, the example I have in mind, adding x to a radial solution, would still be a weak solution, and x is in L²(B₁), for example. So even in Sobolev spaces, you can have non-radial solutions. 

Therefore, unless there&#x27;s a hidden assumption, the answer is no. So I think the answer is no, and the box should be \boxed{No}. But let me check standard references or theorems.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: if a function satisfies Δu = 0 in a radially symmetric domain and u is radial, then u is radial. Wait, that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, if the equation is rotationally invariant and the domain is rotationally invariant, then for each solution, its rotations are also solutions. Therefore, by averaging over rotations, you can obtain a radial solution. But that doesn&#x27;t mean all solutions are radial. 

Alternatively, the Poisson equation with radial inhomogeneity f(|x|) might have a radial particular solution, and then the homogeneous solutions (harmonic functions) can be added. Since harmonic functions can be non-radial, the general solution need not be radial. Therefore, the answer is no. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that u does not have to be radial. So the final answer is \boxed{No}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the equation \(\Delta u = f(|x|)\) in the unit ball \(B_1 \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) where \(f: [0, \infty) \to \mathbb{R}\) is a continuous function, we need to determine if the solution \(u(x)\) must be expressible as \(v(|x|)\) for some function \(v\).

1. **Laplacian in Spherical Coordinates**: For a radial function \(v(r)\), the Laplacian simplifies to \(\Delta v = v&#x27;&#x27;(r) + \frac{n-1}{r} v&#x27;(r)\). This shows that if \(u\) is radial, the Laplacian will be a function of \(r\) alone, matching \(f(|x|)\).

2. **Non-Uniqueness of Solutions**: Without boundary conditions, solutions to the Poisson equation \(\Delta u = f(|x|)\) are not unique. Any harmonic function (satisfying \(\Delta u = 0\)) can be added to a particular solution to yield another solution. Harmonic functions in the unit ball do not have to be radial (e.g., \(x_1, x_2, \ldots\) in \(\mathbb{R}^n\)).

3. **Example with Non-Radial Solution**: Consider \(f(|x|) = 1\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\). A particular solution is \(u_p(r) = \frac{r^2}{4}\), which is radial. Adding a non-radial harmonic function like \(h(x, y) = x\) results in a non-radial solution \(u = \frac{r^2}{4} + x\), which still satisfies \(\Delta u = 1\).

4. **Conclusion**: Since non-radial harmonic functions can be added to radial solutions, and harmonic functions are not necessarily radial, the solution \(u(x)\) does not have to be radial. The lack of boundary conditions allows for non-unique solutions, some of which are non-radial.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{No}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem here: If a function u solves the equation Δu = f(|x|) in the unit ball B₁ ⊂ ℝⁿ, where f is a continuous function from [0, ∞) to ℝ, must u(x) necessarily be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v? Hmm, interesting. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, let me recall what Δu means. That&#x27;s the Laplacian of u, right? So in n dimensions, the Laplacian operator is the sum of the second partial derivatives with respect to each coordinate. So Δu = ∂²u/∂x₁² + ∂²u/∂x₂² + ... + ∂²u/∂xₙ². 

Now, the equation given is Δu = f(|x|). The function f depends only on the radial distance |x| from the origin. So the right-hand side of the equation is radially symmetric. The question is whether the solution u must also be radially symmetric, i.e., expressible as v(|x|). 

I remember that for certain PDEs with radial symmetry in the equation or the domain, solutions can inherit that symmetry. For example, in electrostatics, the potential due to a spherically symmetric charge distribution is also spherically symmetric. But I need to verify if this is always the case here, or if there might be solutions that aren&#x27;t radial.

Because in polar coordinates, the Laplacian is u&#x27;&#x27; + (1/r) u&#x27;, so if u_p = (r²)/4, then u_p&#x27; = r/2, u_p&#x27;&#x27; = 1/2, so Δu_p = 1/2 + (1/r)(r/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which matches f(|x|)=1. So that&#x27;s a radial solution. 

However, we can add any harmonic function to u_p and still have a solution. For example, take a harmonic function like h(x, y) = x. Then u = u_p + h would be a solution: Δ(u_p + h) = Δu_p + Δh = 1 + 0 = 1. But u = (r²)/4 + x is not radial because x = r cosθ in polar coordinates, so u depends on θ as well. Therefore, this u is not expressible as a function of r alone. Therefore, such a solution is non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer is no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). There exist solutions that are not radially symmetric.

However, the problem statement here doesn&#x27;t mention boundary conditions. Wait, that&#x27;s a point. The equation is Δu = f(|x|) in B₁, but no boundary conditions are specified. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that u is a solution without any specific boundary conditions, or perhaps considering the general case. But in PDEs, uniqueness usually comes with boundary conditions. Without boundary conditions, there might be multiple solutions. For example, you can add any harmonic function (satisfying Δu = 0) to a particular solution and get another solution. So if there&#x27;s a non-radial harmonic function, then adding it to a radial solution would give a non-radial solution. But harmonic functions on the unit ball don&#x27;t necessarily have to be radial. For instance, in 3D, the function x (or y, z) is harmonic but not radial. 

But wait, in that case, if we have a Poisson equation Δu = f(|x|) with no boundary conditions specified, then solutions are not unique. Therefore, there might exist both radial and non-radial solutions. But the question is phrased as &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|)&quot;, i.e., is every solution necessarily radial? If there exists a non-radial solution, then the answer is no. 

But maybe the problem is assuming some implicit boundary conditions, like Dirichlet or Neumann? Since the unit ball is a bounded domain, perhaps the question is considering solutions in a certain class, like classical solutions, but without boundary conditions, the answer might not be necessarily radial. However, maybe even without boundary conditions, the equation Δu = f(|x|) forces u to be radial. 

Wait, let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have two solutions u₁ and u₂ of Δu = f(|x|). Then their difference w = u₁ - u₂ satisfies Δw = 0. So w is harmonic. If we can show that all harmonic functions in B₁ must be radial, then all solutions would be radial. But harmonic functions are not necessarily radial. For example, in 2D, the real part of z^n for integer n is a harmonic function which is not radial. Therefore, unless we impose some boundary conditions like radial symmetry, harmonic functions can break the radial symmetry. 

Therefore, without boundary conditions, the solution u is not unique, and you can have non-radial solutions by adding non-radial harmonic functions. Therefore, the answer would be no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). 

But wait, hold on. Maybe the problem is posed in such a way that u is a solution without any specific mention of boundary conditions, but perhaps considering distributional solutions or something else. Wait, but even distributional solutions to Δu = f(|x|) would not be unique without boundary conditions. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the unique solution under certain boundary conditions, like Dirichlet conditions. For example, if you impose u = g on the boundary ∂B₁, then if g is radial, the solution would be radial. But if g is not radial, then the solution wouldn&#x27;t be radial. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify boundary conditions. 

Wait, let me check the original problem statement again: &quot;If u solves the equation Δu = f(|x|) in the unit ball B₁ ⊂ ℝⁿ, where f: [0, ∞) → ℝ is a continuous function, must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v?&quot; 

So the problem is just saying that u is a solution (without any specific boundary conditions). So given that, then as we discussed, solutions are not unique. Therefore, there can be non-radial solutions. So the answer would be no. 

But let me verify this with an example. Let&#x27;s take n=2 for simplicity. Suppose f(|x|) = 1, so Δu = 1 in the unit disk. A particular solution would be radial. For example, u_p(r) = (r²)/4. Because in polar coordinates, the Laplacian is u&#x27;&#x27; + (1/r) u&#x27;, so if u_p = (r²)/4, then u_p&#x27; = r/2, u_p&#x27;&#x27; = 1/2, so Δu_p = 1/2 + (1/r)(r/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which matches f(|x|)=1. So that&#x27;s a radial solution. 

However, we can add any harmonic function to u_p and still have a solution. For example, take a harmonic function like h(x, y) = x. Then u = u_p + h would be a solution: Δ(u_p + h) = Δu_p + Δh = 1 + 0 = 1. But u = (r²)/4 + x is not radial because x = r cosθ in polar coordinates, so u depends on θ as well. Therefore, this u is not expressible as a function of r alone. Therefore, such a solution is non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer is no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). There exist solutions that are not radially symmetric. 

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering only bounded solutions or solutions with some regularity? But even so, in the example above, x is smooth and bounded in the unit ball. So even with smoothness, we can have non-radial solutions. 

Alternatively, perhaps if the problem had specified boundary conditions like u = 0 on the boundary, then maybe the solution would have to be radial. Let&#x27;s check that. Suppose we have Δu = f(|x|) with u = 0 on ∂B₁. Then, is the solution necessarily radial? 

In that case, maybe yes. Because the equation and the boundary condition are both radially symmetric, so by symmetry, the solution should also be radial. Let me recall the uniqueness of solutions for the Dirichlet problem. If you have a unique solution, and if the problem is invariant under rotations, then the solution must also be invariant under rotations, hence radial. 

So in the case where boundary conditions are specified and are radial, then the solution must be radial. But in the original problem, the user hasn&#x27;t specified any boundary conditions. Therefore, without boundary conditions, there are infinitely many solutions, some of which are non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether boundary conditions are imposed. Since the problem statement does not specify any boundary conditions, we have to consider the equation Δu = f(|x|) in B₁ without any restrictions on the boundary. Hence, solutions are not unique, and non-radial solutions exist. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). The answer is no. 

But wait, the problem is stated as &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|)&quot;, i.e., is it necessary that all solutions are radial? Since we can exhibit a non-radial solution, the answer is no. 

However, to be thorough, let me check another example. Suppose f(|x|) = 0. Then the equation is Δu = 0, harmonic functions in the unit ball. There are plenty of non-radial harmonic functions, like the coordinate functions x₁, x₂, etc. So even in the case f ≡ 0, which is a special case of the problem here, there are non-radial solutions. Hence, the answer is indeed no. 

Therefore, unless there are specific boundary conditions imposed (which there aren&#x27;t in the problem statement), the solution does not have to be radial. 

So the final answer is no, u(x) need not be expressible as v(|x|). Therefore, the answer is \boxed{No}. Wait, but the instructions say to put the final answer within \boxed{} and typically for yes/no questions in math, it might expect \boxed{\text{No}} or \boxed{\text{Yes}}. However, looking back, maybe the original problem is from a source where answers are boxed as statements. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the user wrote: &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v? Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.&quot;

But in many math problem contexts, especially in PDEs, when they ask &quot;must u be expressible...&quot;, the answer is typically &quot;No&quot; because without boundary conditions, you can add non-radial harmonics. But maybe the question is trickier. Wait, is there a uniqueness theorem I&#x27;m missing here?

Wait, another thought: if the problem is in the unit ball and f is radial, perhaps even without boundary conditions, the equation Δu = f(|x|) only has radial solutions? But that can&#x27;t be, as we just constructed a non-radial solution by adding a non-radial harmonic function. So unless there is a condition that restricts solutions to be radial, the answer is no. 

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, when you say &quot;solves the equation&quot; in the entire ball, maybe they consider distributional solutions or weak solutions with certain integrability conditions. But even so, the example I have in mind, adding x to a radial solution, would still be a weak solution, and x is in L²(B₁), for example. So even in Sobolev spaces, you can have non-radial solutions. 

Therefore, unless there&#x27;s a hidden assumption, the answer is no. So I think the answer is no, and the box should be \boxed{No}. But let me check standard references or theorems.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: if a function satisfies Δu = 0 in a radially symmetric domain and u is radial, then u is radial. Wait, that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, if the equation is rotationally invariant and the domain is rotationally invariant, then for each solution, its rotations are also solutions. Therefore, by averaging over rotations, you can obtain a radial solution. But that doesn&#x27;t mean all solutions are radial. 

Alternatively, the Poisson equation with radial inhomogeneity f(|x|) might have a radial particular solution, and then the homogeneous solutions (harmonic functions) can be added. Since harmonic functions can be non-radial, the general solution need not be radial. Therefore, the answer is no. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that u does not have to be radial. So the final answer is \boxed{No}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the equation \(\Delta u = f(|x|)\) in the unit ball \(B_1 \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) where \(f: [0, \infty) \to \mathbb{R}\) is a continuous function, we need to determine if the solution \(u(x)\) must be expressible as \(v(|x|)\) for some function \(v\).

1. **Laplacian in Spherical Coordinates**: For a radial function \(v(r)\), the Laplacian simplifies to \(\Delta v = v&#x27;&#x27;(r) + \frac{n-1}{r} v&#x27;(r)\). This shows that if \(u\) is radial, the Laplacian will be a function of \(r\) alone, matching \(f(|x|)\).

2. **Non-Uniqueness of Solutions**: Without boundary conditions, solutions to the Poisson equation \(\Delta u = f(|x|)\) are not unique. Any harmonic function (satisfying \(\Delta u = 0\)) can be added to a particular solution to yield another solution. Harmonic functions in the unit ball do not have to be radial (e.g., \(x_1, x_2, \ldots\) in \(\mathbb{R}^n\)).

3. **Example with Non-Radial Solution**: Consider \(f(|x|) = 1\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\). A particular solution is \(u_p(r) = \frac{r^2}{4}\), which is radial. Adding a non-radial harmonic function like \(h(x, y) = x\) results in a non-radial solution \(u = \frac{r^2}{4} + x\), which still satisfies \(\Delta u = 1\).

4. **Conclusion**: Since non-radial harmonic functions can be added to radial solutions, and harmonic functions are not necessarily radial, the solution \(u(x)\) does not have to be radial. The lack of boundary conditions allows for non-unique solutions, some of which are non-radial.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{No}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem here: If a function u solves the equation Δu = f(|x|) in the unit ball B₁ ⊂ ℝⁿ, where f is a continuous function from [0, ∞) to ℝ, must u(x) necessarily be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v? Hmm, interesting. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, let me recall what Δu means. That&#x27;s the Laplacian of u, right? So in n dimensions, the Laplacian operator is the sum of the second partial derivatives with respect to each coordinate. So Δu = ∂²u/∂x₁² + ∂²u/∂x₂² + ... + ∂²u/∂xₙ². 

Now, the equation given is Δu = f(|x|). The function f depends only on the radial distance |x| from the origin. So the right-hand side of the equation is radially symmetric. The question is whether the solution u must also be radially symmetric, i.e., expressible as v(|x|). 

I remember that for certain PDEs with radial symmetry in the equation or the domain, solutions can inherit that symmetry. For example, in electrostatics, the potential due to a spherically symmetric charge distribution is also spherically symmetric. But I need to verify if this is always the case here, or if there might be solutions that aren&#x27;t radial.

The domain here is the unit ball, which is a radially symmetric domain. The equation has a radially symmetric forcing term f(|x|). So maybe the solution must also be radially symmetric. But how can I be sure?

One approach might be to use the method of separation of variables or to look for solutions in polar coordinates. Since the problem is set in the unit ball, it might be helpful to express the Laplacian in spherical coordinates. In spherical coordinates, the Laplacian operator for a radial function v(r) simplifies significantly. Specifically, for a radial function v(r), where r = |x|, the Laplacian becomes Δv = v&#x27;&#x27;(r) + (n-1)/r * v&#x27;(r). So if u is radial, then Δu would just be a function of r, which matches the right-hand side f(r). 

But the question is whether any solution u must be radial. Suppose there exists a non-radial solution. Then, by some symmetry argument, maybe we can show that such a solution cannot exist. Alternatively, perhaps by the uniqueness of solutions to the Poisson equation with certain boundary conditions, the solution must be radial.

Because in polar coordinates, the Laplacian is u&#x27;&#x27; + (1/r) u&#x27;, so if u_p = (r²)/4, then u_p&#x27; = r/2, u_p&#x27;&#x27; = 1/2, so Δu_p = 1/2 + (1/r)(r/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which matches f(|x|)=1. So that&#x27;s a radial solution. 

However, we can add any harmonic function to u_p and still have a solution. For example, take a harmonic function like h(x, y) = x. Then u = u_p + h would be a solution: Δ(u_p + h) = Δu_p + Δh = 1 + 0 = 1. But u = (r²)/4 + x is not radial because x = r cosθ in polar coordinates, so u depends on θ as well. Therefore, this u is not expressible as a function of r alone. Therefore, such a solution is non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer is no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). There exist solutions that are not radially symmetric. 

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering only bounded solutions or solutions with some regularity? But even so, in the example above, x is smooth and bounded in the unit ball. So even with smoothness, we can have non-radial solutions.

If there exists a non-radial solution, then the answer is no. 

But maybe the problem is assuming some implicit boundary conditions, like Dirichlet or Neumann? Since the unit ball is a bounded domain, perhaps the question is considering solutions in a certain class, like classical solutions, but without boundary conditions, the answer might not be necessarily radial. However, maybe even without boundary conditions, the equation Δu = f(|x|) forces u to be radial. 

Wait, let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have two solutions u₁ and u₂ of Δu = f(|x|). Then their difference w = u₁ - u₂ satisfies Δw = 0. So w is harmonic. If we can show that all harmonic functions in B₁ must be radial, then all solutions would be radial. But harmonic functions are not necessarily radial. For example, in 2D, the real part of z^n for integer n is a harmonic function which is not radial. Therefore, unless we impose some boundary conditions like radial symmetry, harmonic functions can break the radial symmetry. 

Therefore, without boundary conditions, the solution u is not unique, and you can have non-radial solutions by adding non-radial harmonic functions. Therefore, the answer would be no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). 

But wait, hold on. Maybe the problem is posed in such a way that u is a solution without any specific mention of boundary conditions, but perhaps considering distributional solutions or something else. Wait, but even distributional solutions to Δu = f(|x|) would not be unique without boundary conditions. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the unique solution under certain boundary conditions, like Dirichlet conditions. For example, if you impose u = g on the boundary ∂B₁, then if g is radial, the solution would be radial. But if g is not radial, then the solution wouldn&#x27;t be radial. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify boundary conditions. 

Wait, let me check the original problem statement again: &quot;If u solves the equation Δu = f(|x|) in the unit ball B₁ ⊂ ℝⁿ, where f: [0, ∞) → ℝ is a continuous function, must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v?&quot; 

So the problem is just saying that u is a solution (without any specific boundary conditions). So given that, then as we discussed, solutions are not unique. Therefore, there can be non-radial solutions. So the answer would be no. 

But let me verify this with an example. Let&#x27;s take n=2 for simplicity. Suppose f(|x|) = 1, so Δu = 1 in the unit disk. A particular solution would be radial. For example, u_p(r) = (r²)/4. Because in polar coordinates, the Laplacian is u&#x27;&#x27; + (1/r) u&#x27;, so if u_p = (r²)/4, then u_p&#x27; = r/2, u_p&#x27;&#x27; = 1/2, so Δu_p = 1/2 + (1/r)(r/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which matches f(|x|)=1. So that&#x27;s a radial solution. 

However, we can add any harmonic function to u_p and still have a solution. For example, take a harmonic function like h(x, y) = x. Then u = u_p + h would be a solution: Δ(u_p + h) = Δu_p + Δh = 1 + 0 = 1. But u = (r²)/4 + x is not radial because x = r cosθ in polar coordinates, so u depends on θ as well. Therefore, this u is not expressible as a function of r alone. Therefore, such a solution is non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer is no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). There exist solutions that are not radially symmetric. 

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering only bounded solutions or solutions with some regularity? But even so, in the example above, x is smooth and bounded in the unit ball. So even with smoothness, we can have non-radial solutions. 

Alternatively, perhaps if the problem had specified boundary conditions like u = 0 on the boundary, then maybe the solution would have to be radial. Let&#x27;s check that. Suppose we have Δu = f(|x|) with u = 0 on ∂B₁. Then, is the solution necessarily radial? 

In that case, maybe yes. Because the equation and the boundary condition are both radially symmetric, so by symmetry, the solution should also be radial. Let me recall the uniqueness of solutions for the Dirichlet problem. If you have a unique solution, and if the problem is invariant under rotations, then the solution must also be invariant under rotations, hence radial. 

So in the case where boundary conditions are specified and are radial, then the solution must be radial. But in the original problem, the user hasn&#x27;t specified any boundary conditions. Therefore, without boundary conditions, there are infinitely many solutions, some of which are non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether boundary conditions are imposed. Since the problem statement does not specify any boundary conditions, we have to consider the equation Δu = f(|x|) in B₁ without any restrictions on the boundary. Hence, solutions are not unique, and non-radial solutions exist. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). The answer is no. 

But wait, the problem is stated as &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|)&quot;, i.e., is it necessary that all solutions are radial? Since we can exhibit a non-radial solution, the answer is no. 

However, to be thorough, let me check another example. Suppose f(|x|) = 0. Then the equation is Δu = 0, harmonic functions in the unit ball. There are plenty of non-radial harmonic functions, like the coordinate functions x₁, x₂, etc. So even in the case f ≡ 0, which is a special case of the problem here, there are non-radial solutions. Hence, the answer is indeed no. 

Therefore, unless there are specific boundary conditions imposed (which there aren&#x27;t in the problem statement), the solution does not have to be radial. 

So the final answer is no, u(x) need not be expressible as v(|x|). Therefore, the answer is \boxed{No}. Wait, but the instructions say to put the final answer within \boxed{} and typically for yes/no questions in math, it might expect \boxed{\text{No}} or \boxed{\text{Yes}}. However, looking back, maybe the original problem is from a source where answers are boxed as statements. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the user wrote: &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v? Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.&quot;

But in many math problem contexts, especially in PDEs, when they ask &quot;must u be expressible...&quot;, the answer is typically &quot;No&quot; because without boundary conditions, you can add non-radial harmonics. But maybe the question is trickier. Wait, is there a uniqueness theorem I&#x27;m missing here?

Wait, another thought: if the problem is in the unit ball and f is radial, perhaps even without boundary conditions, the equation Δu = f(|x|) only has radial solutions? But that can&#x27;t be, as we just constructed a non-radial solution by adding a non-radial harmonic function. So unless there is a condition that restricts solutions to be radial, the answer is no. 

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, when you say &quot;solves the equation&quot; in the entire ball, maybe they consider distributional solutions or weak solutions with certain integrability conditions. But even so, the example I have in mind, adding x to a radial solution, would still be a weak solution, and x is in L²(B₁), for example. So even in Sobolev spaces, you can have non-radial solutions. 

Therefore, unless there&#x27;s a hidden assumption, the answer is no. So I think the answer is no, and the box should be \boxed{No}. But let me check standard references or theorems.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: if a function satisfies Δu = 0 in a radially symmetric domain and u is radial, then u is radial. Wait, that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, if the equation is rotationally invariant and the domain is rotationally invariant, then for each solution, its rotations are also solutions. Therefore, by averaging over rotations, you can obtain a radial solution. But that doesn&#x27;t mean all solutions are radial. 

Alternatively, the Poisson equation with radial inhomogeneity f(|x|) might have a radial particular solution, and then the homogeneous solutions (harmonic functions) can be added. Since harmonic functions can be non-radial, the general solution need not be radial. Therefore, the answer is no. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that u does not have to be radial. So the final answer is \boxed{No}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the equation \(\Delta u = f(|x|)\) in the unit ball \(B_1 \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) where \(f: [0, \infty) \to \mathbb{R}\) is a continuous function, we need to determine if the solution \(u(x)\) must be expressible as \(v(|x|)\) for some function \(v\).

1. **Laplacian in Spherical Coordinates**: For a radial function \(v(r)\), the Laplacian simplifies to \(\Delta v = v&#x27;&#x27;(r) + \frac{n-1}{r} v&#x27;(r)\). This shows that if \(u\) is radial, the Laplacian will be a function of \(r\) alone, matching \(f(|x|)\).

2. **Non-Uniqueness of Solutions**: Without boundary conditions, solutions to the Poisson equation \(\Delta u = f(|x|)\) are not unique. Any harmonic function (satisfying \(\Delta u = 0\)) can be added to a particular solution to yield another solution. Harmonic functions in the unit ball do not have to be radial (e.g., \(x_1, x_2, \ldots\) in \(\mathbb{R}^n\)).

3. **Example with Non-Radial Solution**: Consider \(f(|x|) = 1\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\). A particular solution is \(u_p(r) = \frac{r^2}{4}\), which is radial. Adding a non-radial harmonic function like \(h(x, y) = x\) results in a non-radial solution \(u = \frac{r^2}{4} + x\), which still satisfies \(\Delta u = 1\).

4. **Conclusion**: Since non-radial harmonic functions can be added to radial solutions, and harmonic functions are not necessarily radial, the solution \(u(x)\) does not have to be radial. The lack of boundary conditions allows for non-unique solutions, some of which are non-radial.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{No}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem here: If a function u solves the equation Δu = f(|x|) in the unit ball B₁ ⊂ ℝⁿ, where f is a continuous function from [0, ∞) to ℝ, must u(x) necessarily be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v? Hmm, interesting. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, let me recall what Δu means. That&#x27;s the Laplacian of u, right? So in n dimensions, the Laplacian operator is the sum of the second partial derivatives with respect to each coordinate. So Δu = ∂²u/∂x₁² + ∂²u/∂x₂² + ... + ∂²u/∂xₙ². 

Now, the equation given is Δu = f(|x|). The function f depends only on the radial distance |x| from the origin. So the right-hand side of the equation is radially symmetric. The question is whether the solution u must also be radially symmetric, i.e., expressible as v(|x|). 

I remember that for certain PDEs with radial symmetry in the equation or the domain, solutions can inherit that symmetry. For example, in electrostatics, the potential due to a spherically symmetric charge distribution is also spherically symmetric. But I need to verify if this is always the case here, or if there might be solutions that aren&#x27;t radial.

The domain here is the unit ball, which is a radially symmetric domain. The equation has a radially symmetric forcing term f(|x|). So maybe the solution must also be radially symmetric. But how can I be sure?

One approach might be to use the method of separation of variables or to look for solutions in polar coordinates. Since the problem is set in the unit ball, it might be helpful to express the Laplacian in spherical coordinates. In spherical coordinates, the Laplacian operator for a radial function v(r) simplifies significantly. Specifically, for a radial function v(r), where r = |x|, the Laplacian becomes Δv = v&#x27;&#x27;(r) + (n-1)/r * v&#x27;(r). So if u is radial, then Δu would just be a function of r, which matches the right-hand side f(r). 

But the question is whether any solution u must be radial. Suppose there exists a non-radial solution. Then, by some symmetry argument, maybe we can show that such a solution cannot exist. Alternatively, perhaps by the uniqueness of solutions to the Poisson equation with certain boundary conditions, the solution must be radial. However, the problem statement here doesn&#x27;t mention boundary conditions. Wait, that&#x27;s a point. The equation is Δu = f(|x|) in B₁, but no boundary conditions are specified. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that u is a solution without any specific boundary conditions, or perhaps considering the general case. But in PDEs, uniqueness usually comes with boundary conditions. Without boundary conditions, there might be multiple solutions. For example, you can add any harmonic function (satisfying Δu = 0) to a particular solution and get another solution. So if there&#x27;s a non-radial harmonic function, then adding it to a radial solution would give a non-radial solution. But harmonic functions on the unit ball don&#x27;t necessarily have to be radial. For instance, in 3D, the function x (or y, z) is harmonic but not radial. 

But wait, in that case, if we have a Poisson equation Δu = f(|x|) with no boundary conditions specified, then solutions are not unique. Therefore, there might exist both radial and non-radial solutions. But the question is phrased as &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|)&quot;, i.e., is every solution necessarily radial?

If we can show that all harmonic functions in B₁ must be radial, then all solutions would be radial. But harmonic functions are not necessarily radial.

Therefore, unless we impose some boundary conditions like radial symmetry, harmonic functions can break the radial symmetry.

Wait, but even distributional solutions to Δu = f(|x|) would not be unique without boundary conditions.

For example, if you impose u = g on the boundary ∂B₁, then if g is radial, the solution would be radial. But if g is not radial, then the solution wouldn&#x27;t be radial. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify boundary conditions.

Because in polar coordinates, the Laplacian is u&#x27;&#x27; + (1/r) u&#x27;, so if u_p = (r²)/4, then u_p&#x27; = r/2, u_p&#x27;&#x27; = 1/2, so Δu_p = 1/2 + (1/r)(r/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which matches f(|x|)=1. So that&#x27;s a radial solution. 

However, we can add any harmonic function to u_p and still have a solution. For example, take a harmonic function like h(x, y) = x. Then u = u_p + h would be a solution: Δ(u_p + h) = Δu_p + Δh = 1 + 0 = 1. But u = (r²)/4 + x is not radial because x = r cosθ in polar coordinates, so u depends on θ as well. Therefore, this u is not expressible as a function of r alone. Therefore, such a solution is non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer is no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). There exist solutions that are not radially symmetric. 

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering only bounded solutions or solutions with some regularity? But even so, in the example above, x is smooth and bounded in the unit ball. So even with smoothness, we can have non-radial solutions. 

Alternatively, perhaps if the problem had specified boundary conditions like u = 0 on the boundary, then maybe the solution would have to be radial. Let&#x27;s check that. Suppose we have Δu = f(|x|) with u = 0 on ∂B₁. Then, is the solution necessarily radial?

Therefore, without boundary conditions, the solution u is not unique, and you can have non-radial solutions by adding non-radial harmonic functions. Therefore, the answer would be no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). 

But wait, hold on. Maybe the problem is posed in such a way that u is a solution without any specific mention of boundary conditions, but perhaps considering distributional solutions or something else. Wait, but even distributional solutions to Δu = f(|x|) would not be unique without boundary conditions. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the unique solution under certain boundary conditions, like Dirichlet conditions. For example, if you impose u = g on the boundary ∂B₁, then if g is radial, the solution would be radial. But if g is not radial, then the solution wouldn&#x27;t be radial. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify boundary conditions. 

Wait, let me check the original problem statement again: &quot;If u solves the equation Δu = f(|x|) in the unit ball B₁ ⊂ ℝⁿ, where f: [0, ∞) → ℝ is a continuous function, must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v?&quot; 

So the problem is just saying that u is a solution (without any specific boundary conditions). So given that, then as we discussed, solutions are not unique. Therefore, there can be non-radial solutions. So the answer would be no. 

But let me verify this with an example. Let&#x27;s take n=2 for simplicity. Suppose f(|x|) = 1, so Δu = 1 in the unit disk. A particular solution would be radial. For example, u_p(r) = (r²)/4. Because in polar coordinates, the Laplacian is u&#x27;&#x27; + (1/r) u&#x27;, so if u_p = (r²)/4, then u_p&#x27; = r/2, u_p&#x27;&#x27; = 1/2, so Δu_p = 1/2 + (1/r)(r/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which matches f(|x|)=1. So that&#x27;s a radial solution. 

However, we can add any harmonic function to u_p and still have a solution. For example, take a harmonic function like h(x, y) = x. Then u = u_p + h would be a solution: Δ(u_p + h) = Δu_p + Δh = 1 + 0 = 1. But u = (r²)/4 + x is not radial because x = r cosθ in polar coordinates, so u depends on θ as well. Therefore, this u is not expressible as a function of r alone. Therefore, such a solution is non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer is no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). There exist solutions that are not radially symmetric. 

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering only bounded solutions or solutions with some regularity? But even so, in the example above, x is smooth and bounded in the unit ball. So even with smoothness, we can have non-radial solutions. 

Alternatively, perhaps if the problem had specified boundary conditions like u = 0 on the boundary, then maybe the solution would have to be radial. Let&#x27;s check that. Suppose we have Δu = f(|x|) with u = 0 on ∂B₁. Then, is the solution necessarily radial? 

In that case, maybe yes. Because the equation and the boundary condition are both radially symmetric, so by symmetry, the solution should also be radial. Let me recall the uniqueness of solutions for the Dirichlet problem. If you have a unique solution, and if the problem is invariant under rotations, then the solution must also be invariant under rotations, hence radial. 

So in the case where boundary conditions are specified and are radial, then the solution must be radial. But in the original problem, the user hasn&#x27;t specified any boundary conditions. Therefore, without boundary conditions, there are infinitely many solutions, some of which are non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether boundary conditions are imposed. Since the problem statement does not specify any boundary conditions, we have to consider the equation Δu = f(|x|) in B₁ without any restrictions on the boundary. Hence, solutions are not unique, and non-radial solutions exist. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). The answer is no. 

But wait, the problem is stated as &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|)&quot;, i.e., is it necessary that all solutions are radial? Since we can exhibit a non-radial solution, the answer is no. 

However, to be thorough, let me check another example. Suppose f(|x|) = 0. Then the equation is Δu = 0, harmonic functions in the unit ball. There are plenty of non-radial harmonic functions, like the coordinate functions x₁, x₂, etc. So even in the case f ≡ 0, which is a special case of the problem here, there are non-radial solutions. Hence, the answer is indeed no. 

Therefore, unless there are specific boundary conditions imposed (which there aren&#x27;t in the problem statement), the solution does not have to be radial. 

So the final answer is no, u(x) need not be expressible as v(|x|). Therefore, the answer is \boxed{No}. Wait, but the instructions say to put the final answer within \boxed{} and typically for yes/no questions in math, it might expect \boxed{\text{No}} or \boxed{\text{Yes}}. However, looking back, maybe the original problem is from a source where answers are boxed as statements. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the user wrote: &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v? Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.&quot;

But in many math problem contexts, especially in PDEs, when they ask &quot;must u be expressible...&quot;, the answer is typically &quot;No&quot; because without boundary conditions, you can add non-radial harmonics. But maybe the question is trickier. Wait, is there a uniqueness theorem I&#x27;m missing here?

Wait, another thought: if the problem is in the unit ball and f is radial, perhaps even without boundary conditions, the equation Δu = f(|x|) only has radial solutions? But that can&#x27;t be, as we just constructed a non-radial solution by adding a non-radial harmonic function. So unless there is a condition that restricts solutions to be radial, the answer is no. 

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, when you say &quot;solves the equation&quot; in the entire ball, maybe they consider distributional solutions or weak solutions with certain integrability conditions. But even so, the example I have in mind, adding x to a radial solution, would still be a weak solution, and x is in L²(B₁), for example. So even in Sobolev spaces, you can have non-radial solutions. 

Therefore, unless there&#x27;s a hidden assumption, the answer is no. So I think the answer is no, and the box should be \boxed{No}. But let me check standard references or theorems.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: if a function satisfies Δu = 0 in a radially symmetric domain and u is radial, then u is radial. Wait, that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, if the equation is rotationally invariant and the domain is rotationally invariant, then for each solution, its rotations are also solutions. Therefore, by averaging over rotations, you can obtain a radial solution. But that doesn&#x27;t mean all solutions are radial. 

Alternatively, the Poisson equation with radial inhomogeneity f(|x|) might have a radial particular solution, and then the homogeneous solutions (harmonic functions) can be added. Since harmonic functions can be non-radial, the general solution need not be radial. Therefore, the answer is no. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that u does not have to be radial. So the final answer is \boxed{No}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the equation \(\Delta u = f(|x|)\) in the unit ball \(B_1 \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) where \(f: [0, \infty) \to \mathbb{R}\) is a continuous function, we need to determine if the solution \(u(x)\) must be expressible as \(v(|x|)\) for some function \(v\).

1. **Laplacian in Spherical Coordinates**: For a radial function \(v(r)\), the Laplacian simplifies to \(\Delta v = v&#x27;&#x27;(r) + \frac{n-1}{r} v&#x27;(r)\). This shows that if \(u\) is radial, the Laplacian will be a function of \(r\) alone, matching \(f(|x|)\).

2. **Non-Uniqueness of Solutions**: Without boundary conditions, solutions to the Poisson equation \(\Delta u = f(|x|)\) are not unique. Any harmonic function (satisfying \(\Delta u = 0\)) can be added to a particular solution to yield another solution. Harmonic functions in the unit ball do not have to be radial (e.g., \(x_1, x_2, \ldots\) in \(\mathbb{R}^n\)).

3. **Example with Non-Radial Solution**: Consider \(f(|x|) = 1\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\). A particular solution is \(u_p(r) = \frac{r^2}{4}\), which is radial. Adding a non-radial harmonic function like \(h(x, y) = x\) results in a non-radial solution \(u = \frac{r^2}{4} + x\), which still satisfies \(\Delta u = 1\).

4. **Conclusion**: Since non-radial harmonic functions can be added to radial solutions, and harmonic functions are not necessarily radial, the solution \(u(x)\) does not have to be radial. The lack of boundary conditions allows for non-unique solutions, some of which are non-radial.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{No}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem here: If a function u solves the equation Δu = f(|x|) in the unit ball B₁ ⊂ ℝⁿ, where f is a continuous function from [0, ∞) to ℝ, must u(x) necessarily be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v? Hmm, interesting. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, let me recall what Δu means. That&#x27;s the Laplacian of u, right? So in n dimensions, the Laplacian operator is the sum of the second partial derivatives with respect to each coordinate. So Δu = ∂²u/∂x₁² + ∂²u/∂x₂² + ... + ∂²u/∂xₙ². 

Now, the equation given is Δu = f(|x|). The function f depends only on the radial distance |x| from the origin. So the right-hand side of the equation is radially symmetric. The question is whether the solution u must also be radially symmetric, i.e., expressible as v(|x|). 

I remember that for certain PDEs with radial symmetry in the equation or the domain, solutions can inherit that symmetry. For example, in electrostatics, the potential due to a spherically symmetric charge distribution is also spherically symmetric. But I need to verify if this is always the case here, or if there might be solutions that aren&#x27;t radial.

The domain here is the unit ball, which is a radially symmetric domain. The equation has a radially symmetric forcing term f(|x|). So maybe the solution must also be radially symmetric. But how can I be sure?

One approach might be to use the method of separation of variables or to look for solutions in polar coordinates. Since the problem is set in the unit ball, it might be helpful to express the Laplacian in spherical coordinates. In spherical coordinates, the Laplacian operator for a radial function v(r) simplifies significantly. Specifically, for a radial function v(r), where r = |x|, the Laplacian becomes Δv = v&#x27;&#x27;(r) + (n-1)/r * v&#x27;(r). So if u is radial, then Δu would just be a function of r, which matches the right-hand side f(r). 

But the question is whether any solution u must be radial. Suppose there exists a non-radial solution. Then, by some symmetry argument, maybe we can show that such a solution cannot exist. Alternatively, perhaps by the uniqueness of solutions to the Poisson equation with certain boundary conditions, the solution must be radial. However, the problem statement here doesn&#x27;t mention boundary conditions. Wait, that&#x27;s a point. The equation is Δu = f(|x|) in B₁, but no boundary conditions are specified. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that u is a solution without any specific boundary conditions, or perhaps considering the general case. But in PDEs, uniqueness usually comes with boundary conditions. Without boundary conditions, there might be multiple solutions. For example, you can add any harmonic function (satisfying Δu = 0) to a particular solution and get another solution. So if there&#x27;s a non-radial harmonic function, then adding it to a radial solution would give a non-radial solution. But harmonic functions on the unit ball don&#x27;t necessarily have to be radial. For instance, in 3D, the function x (or y, z) is harmonic but not radial. 

But wait, in that case, if we have a Poisson equation Δu = f(|x|) with no boundary conditions specified, then solutions are not unique. Therefore, there might exist both radial and non-radial solutions. But the question is phrased as &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|)&quot;, i.e., is every solution necessarily radial? If there exists a non-radial solution, then the answer is no. 

But maybe the problem is assuming some implicit boundary conditions, like Dirichlet or Neumann? Since the unit ball is a bounded domain, perhaps the question is considering solutions in a certain class, like classical solutions, but without boundary conditions, the answer might not be necessarily radial. However, maybe even without boundary conditions, the equation Δu = f(|x|) forces u to be radial. 

Wait, let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have two solutions u₁ and u₂ of Δu = f(|x|). Then their difference w = u₁ - u₂ satisfies Δw = 0. So w is harmonic. If we can show that all harmonic functions in B₁ must be radial, then all solutions would be radial. But harmonic functions are not necessarily radial. For example, in 2D, the real part of z^n for integer n is a harmonic function which is not radial. Therefore, unless we impose some boundary conditions like radial symmetry, harmonic functions can break the radial symmetry. 

Therefore, without boundary conditions, the solution u is not unique, and you can have non-radial solutions by adding non-radial harmonic functions. Therefore, the answer would be no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). 

But wait, hold on. Maybe the problem is posed in such a way that u is a solution without any specific mention of boundary conditions, but perhaps considering distributional solutions or something else. Wait, but even distributional solutions to Δu = f(|x|) would not be unique without boundary conditions. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the unique solution under certain boundary conditions, like Dirichlet conditions. For example, if you impose u = g on the boundary ∂B₁, then if g is radial, the solution would be radial. But if g is not radial, then the solution wouldn&#x27;t be radial. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify boundary conditions. 

Wait, let me check the original problem statement again: &quot;If u solves the equation Δu = f(|x|) in the unit ball B₁ ⊂ ℝⁿ, where f: [0, ∞) → ℝ is a continuous function, must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v?&quot;

But let me verify this with an example. Let&#x27;s take n=2 for simplicity. Suppose f(|x|) = 1, so Δu = 1 in the unit disk. A particular solution would be radial. For example, u_p(r) = (r²)/4. Because in polar coordinates, the Laplacian is u&#x27;&#x27; + (1/r) u&#x27;, so if u_p = (r²)/4, then u_p&#x27; = r/2, u_p&#x27;&#x27; = 1/2, so Δu_p = 1/2 + (1/r)(r/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which matches f(|x|)=1. So that&#x27;s a radial solution. 

However, we can add any harmonic function to u_p and still have a solution. For example, take a harmonic function like h(x, y) = x. Then u = u_p + h would be a solution: Δ(u_p + h) = Δu_p + Δh = 1 + 0 = 1. But u = (r²)/4 + x is not radial because x = r cosθ in polar coordinates, so u depends on θ as well. Therefore, this u is not expressible as a function of r alone. Therefore, such a solution is non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer is no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). There exist solutions that are not radially symmetric. 

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering only bounded solutions or solutions with some regularity? But even so, in the example above, x is smooth and bounded in the unit ball. So even with smoothness, we can have non-radial solutions.

So the problem is just saying that u is a solution (without any specific boundary conditions). So given that, then as we discussed, solutions are not unique. Therefore, there can be non-radial solutions. So the answer would be no. 

But let me verify this with an example. Let&#x27;s take n=2 for simplicity. Suppose f(|x|) = 1, so Δu = 1 in the unit disk. A particular solution would be radial. For example, u_p(r) = (r²)/4. Because in polar coordinates, the Laplacian is u&#x27;&#x27; + (1/r) u&#x27;, so if u_p = (r²)/4, then u_p&#x27; = r/2, u_p&#x27;&#x27; = 1/2, so Δu_p = 1/2 + (1/r)(r/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which matches f(|x|)=1. So that&#x27;s a radial solution. 

However, we can add any harmonic function to u_p and still have a solution. For example, take a harmonic function like h(x, y) = x. Then u = u_p + h would be a solution: Δ(u_p + h) = Δu_p + Δh = 1 + 0 = 1. But u = (r²)/4 + x is not radial because x = r cosθ in polar coordinates, so u depends on θ as well. Therefore, this u is not expressible as a function of r alone. Therefore, such a solution is non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer is no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). There exist solutions that are not radially symmetric. 

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering only bounded solutions or solutions with some regularity? But even so, in the example above, x is smooth and bounded in the unit ball. So even with smoothness, we can have non-radial solutions. 

Alternatively, perhaps if the problem had specified boundary conditions like u = 0 on the boundary, then maybe the solution would have to be radial. Let&#x27;s check that. Suppose we have Δu = f(|x|) with u = 0 on ∂B₁. Then, is the solution necessarily radial? 

In that case, maybe yes. Because the equation and the boundary condition are both radially symmetric, so by symmetry, the solution should also be radial. Let me recall the uniqueness of solutions for the Dirichlet problem. If you have a unique solution, and if the problem is invariant under rotations, then the solution must also be invariant under rotations, hence radial. 

So in the case where boundary conditions are specified and are radial, then the solution must be radial. But in the original problem, the user hasn&#x27;t specified any boundary conditions. Therefore, without boundary conditions, there are infinitely many solutions, some of which are non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether boundary conditions are imposed. Since the problem statement does not specify any boundary conditions, we have to consider the equation Δu = f(|x|) in B₁ without any restrictions on the boundary. Hence, solutions are not unique, and non-radial solutions exist. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). The answer is no. 

But wait, the problem is stated as &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|)&quot;, i.e., is it necessary that all solutions are radial? Since we can exhibit a non-radial solution, the answer is no. 

However, to be thorough, let me check another example. Suppose f(|x|) = 0. Then the equation is Δu = 0, harmonic functions in the unit ball. There are plenty of non-radial harmonic functions, like the coordinate functions x₁, x₂, etc. So even in the case f ≡ 0, which is a special case of the problem here, there are non-radial solutions. Hence, the answer is indeed no. 

Therefore, unless there are specific boundary conditions imposed (which there aren&#x27;t in the problem statement), the solution does not have to be radial. 

So the final answer is no, u(x) need not be expressible as v(|x|). Therefore, the answer is \boxed{No}. Wait, but the instructions say to put the final answer within \boxed{} and typically for yes/no questions in math, it might expect \boxed{\text{No}} or \boxed{\text{Yes}}. However, looking back, maybe the original problem is from a source where answers are boxed as statements. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the user wrote: &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v? Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.&quot;

But in many math problem contexts, especially in PDEs, when they ask &quot;must u be expressible...&quot;, the answer is typically &quot;No&quot; because without boundary conditions, you can add non-radial harmonics. But maybe the question is trickier. Wait, is there a uniqueness theorem I&#x27;m missing here?

Wait, another thought: if the problem is in the unit ball and f is radial, perhaps even without boundary conditions, the equation Δu = f(|x|) only has radial solutions? But that can&#x27;t be, as we just constructed a non-radial solution by adding a non-radial harmonic function. So unless there is a condition that restricts solutions to be radial, the answer is no. 

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, when you say &quot;solves the equation&quot; in the entire ball, maybe they consider distributional solutions or weak solutions with certain integrability conditions. But even so, the example I have in mind, adding x to a radial solution, would still be a weak solution, and x is in L²(B₁), for example. So even in Sobolev spaces, you can have non-radial solutions. 

Therefore, unless there&#x27;s a hidden assumption, the answer is no. So I think the answer is no, and the box should be \boxed{No}. But let me check standard references or theorems.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: if a function satisfies Δu = 0 in a radially symmetric domain and u is radial, then u is radial. Wait, that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, if the equation is rotationally invariant and the domain is rotationally invariant, then for each solution, its rotations are also solutions. Therefore, by averaging over rotations, you can obtain a radial solution. But that doesn&#x27;t mean all solutions are radial. 

Alternatively, the Poisson equation with radial inhomogeneity f(|x|) might have a radial particular solution, and then the homogeneous solutions (harmonic functions) can be added. Since harmonic functions can be non-radial, the general solution need not be radial. Therefore, the answer is no. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that u does not have to be radial. So the final answer is \boxed{No}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the equation \(\Delta u = f(|x|)\) in the unit ball \(B_1 \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) where \(f: [0, \infty) \to \mathbb{R}\) is a continuous function, we need to determine if the solution \(u(x)\) must be expressible as \(v(|x|)\) for some function \(v\).

1. **Laplacian in Spherical Coordinates**: For a radial function \(v(r)\), the Laplacian simplifies to \(\Delta v = v&#x27;&#x27;(r) + \frac{n-1}{r} v&#x27;(r)\). This shows that if \(u\) is radial, the Laplacian will be a function of \(r\) alone, matching \(f(|x|)\).

2. **Non-Uniqueness of Solutions**: Without boundary conditions, solutions to the Poisson equation \(\Delta u = f(|x|)\) are not unique. Any harmonic function (satisfying \(\Delta u = 0\)) can be added to a particular solution to yield another solution. Harmonic functions in the unit ball do not have to be radial (e.g., \(x_1, x_2, \ldots\) in \(\mathbb{R}^n\)).

3. **Example with Non-Radial Solution**: Consider \(f(|x|) = 1\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\). A particular solution is \(u_p(r) = \frac{r^2}{4}\), which is radial. Adding a non-radial harmonic function like \(h(x, y) = x\) results in a non-radial solution \(u = \frac{r^2}{4} + x\), which still satisfies \(\Delta u = 1\).

4. **Conclusion**: Since non-radial harmonic functions can be added to radial solutions, and harmonic functions are not necessarily radial, the solution \(u(x)\) does not have to be radial. The lack of boundary conditions allows for non-unique solutions, some of which are non-radial.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{No}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem here: If a function u solves the equation Δu = f(|x|) in the unit ball B₁ ⊂ ℝⁿ, where f is a continuous function from [0, ∞) to ℝ, must u(x) necessarily be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v? Hmm, interesting. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, let me recall what Δu means. That&#x27;s the Laplacian of u, right? So in n dimensions, the Laplacian operator is the sum of the second partial derivatives with respect to each coordinate. So Δu = ∂²u/∂x₁² + ∂²u/∂x₂² + ... + ∂²u/∂xₙ². 

Now, the equation given is Δu = f(|x|). The function f depends only on the radial distance |x| from the origin. So the right-hand side of the equation is radially symmetric. The question is whether the solution u must also be radially symmetric, i.e., expressible as v(|x|). 

I remember that for certain PDEs with radial symmetry in the equation or the domain, solutions can inherit that symmetry. For example, in electrostatics, the potential due to a spherically symmetric charge distribution is also spherically symmetric. But I need to verify if this is always the case here, or if there might be solutions that aren&#x27;t radial.

The domain here is the unit ball, which is a radially symmetric domain. The equation has a radially symmetric forcing term f(|x|). So maybe the solution must also be radially symmetric. But how can I be sure?

One approach might be to use the method of separation of variables or to look for solutions in polar coordinates. Since the problem is set in the unit ball, it might be helpful to express the Laplacian in spherical coordinates. In spherical coordinates, the Laplacian operator for a radial function v(r) simplifies significantly. Specifically, for a radial function v(r), where r = |x|, the Laplacian becomes Δv = v&#x27;&#x27;(r) + (n-1)/r * v&#x27;(r). So if u is radial, then Δu would just be a function of r, which matches the right-hand side f(r). 

But the question is whether any solution u must be radial. Suppose there exists a non-radial solution. Then, by some symmetry argument, maybe we can show that such a solution cannot exist. Alternatively, perhaps by the uniqueness of solutions to the Poisson equation with certain boundary conditions, the solution must be radial. However, the problem statement here doesn&#x27;t mention boundary conditions. Wait, that&#x27;s a point. The equation is Δu = f(|x|) in B₁, but no boundary conditions are specified. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that u is a solution without any specific boundary conditions, or perhaps considering the general case. But in PDEs, uniqueness usually comes with boundary conditions. Without boundary conditions, there might be multiple solutions. For example, you can add any harmonic function (satisfying Δu = 0) to a particular solution and get another solution. So if there&#x27;s a non-radial harmonic function, then adding it to a radial solution would give a non-radial solution. But harmonic functions on the unit ball don&#x27;t necessarily have to be radial. For instance, in 3D, the function x (or y, z) is harmonic but not radial. 

But wait, in that case, if we have a Poisson equation Δu = f(|x|) with no boundary conditions specified, then solutions are not unique. Therefore, there might exist both radial and non-radial solutions. But the question is phrased as &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|)&quot;, i.e., is every solution necessarily radial? If there exists a non-radial solution, then the answer is no. 

But maybe the problem is assuming some implicit boundary conditions, like Dirichlet or Neumann? Since the unit ball is a bounded domain, perhaps the question is considering solutions in a certain class, like classical solutions, but without boundary conditions, the answer might not be necessarily radial. However, maybe even without boundary conditions, the equation Δu = f(|x|) forces u to be radial. 

Wait, let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have two solutions u₁ and u₂ of Δu = f(|x|). Then their difference w = u₁ - u₂ satisfies Δw = 0. So w is harmonic. If we can show that all harmonic functions in B₁ must be radial, then all solutions would be radial. But harmonic functions are not necessarily radial. For example, in 2D, the real part of z^n for integer n is a harmonic function which is not radial. Therefore, unless we impose some boundary conditions like radial symmetry, harmonic functions can break the radial symmetry. 

Therefore, without boundary conditions, the solution u is not unique, and you can have non-radial solutions by adding non-radial harmonic functions. Therefore, the answer would be no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). 

But wait, hold on. Maybe the problem is posed in such a way that u is a solution without any specific mention of boundary conditions, but perhaps considering distributional solutions or something else. Wait, but even distributional solutions to Δu = f(|x|) would not be unique without boundary conditions. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the unique solution under certain boundary conditions, like Dirichlet conditions. For example, if you impose u = g on the boundary ∂B₁, then if g is radial, the solution would be radial. But if g is not radial, then the solution wouldn&#x27;t be radial. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify boundary conditions. 

Wait, let me check the original problem statement again: &quot;If u solves the equation Δu = f(|x|) in the unit ball B₁ ⊂ ℝⁿ, where f: [0, ∞) → ℝ is a continuous function, must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v?&quot; 

So the problem is just saying that u is a solution (without any specific boundary conditions). So given that, then as we discussed, solutions are not unique. Therefore, there can be non-radial solutions. So the answer would be no. 

But let me verify this with an example. Let&#x27;s take n=2 for simplicity. Suppose f(|x|) = 1, so Δu = 1 in the unit disk. A particular solution would be radial. For example, u_p(r) = (r²)/4. Because in polar coordinates, the Laplacian is u&#x27;&#x27; + (1/r) u&#x27;, so if u_p = (r²)/4, then u_p&#x27; = r/2, u_p&#x27;&#x27; = 1/2, so Δu_p = 1/2 + (1/r)(r/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which matches f(|x|)=1. So that&#x27;s a radial solution. 

However, we can add any harmonic function to u_p and still have a solution. For example, take a harmonic function like h(x, y) = x. Then u = u_p + h would be a solution: Δ(u_p + h) = Δu_p + Δh = 1 + 0 = 1. But u = (r²)/4 + x is not radial because x = r cosθ in polar coordinates, so u depends on θ as well. Therefore, this u is not expressible as a function of r alone. Therefore, such a solution is non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer is no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). There exist solutions that are not radially symmetric. 

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering only bounded solutions or solutions with some regularity? But even so, in the example above, x is smooth and bounded in the unit ball. So even with smoothness, we can have non-radial solutions. 

Alternatively, perhaps if the problem had specified boundary conditions like u = 0 on the boundary, then maybe the solution would have to be radial. Let&#x27;s check that. Suppose we have Δu = f(|x|) with u = 0 on ∂B₁. Then, is the solution necessarily radial?

However, we can add any harmonic function to u_p and still have a solution. For example, take a harmonic function like h(x, y) = x. Then u = u_p + h would be a solution: Δ(u_p + h) = Δu_p + Δh = 1 + 0 = 1. But u = (r²)/4 + x is not radial because x = r cosθ in polar coordinates, so u depends on θ as well. Therefore, this u is not expressible as a function of r alone. Therefore, such a solution is non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer is no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). There exist solutions that are not radially symmetric. 

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering only bounded solutions or solutions with some regularity? But even so, in the example above, x is smooth and bounded in the unit ball. So even with smoothness, we can have non-radial solutions. 

Alternatively, perhaps if the problem had specified boundary conditions like u = 0 on the boundary, then maybe the solution would have to be radial. Let&#x27;s check that. Suppose we have Δu = f(|x|) with u = 0 on ∂B₁. Then, is the solution necessarily radial? 

In that case, maybe yes. Because the equation and the boundary condition are both radially symmetric, so by symmetry, the solution should also be radial. Let me recall the uniqueness of solutions for the Dirichlet problem. If you have a unique solution, and if the problem is invariant under rotations, then the solution must also be invariant under rotations, hence radial. 

So in the case where boundary conditions are specified and are radial, then the solution must be radial. But in the original problem, the user hasn&#x27;t specified any boundary conditions. Therefore, without boundary conditions, there are infinitely many solutions, some of which are non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether boundary conditions are imposed. Since the problem statement does not specify any boundary conditions, we have to consider the equation Δu = f(|x|) in B₁ without any restrictions on the boundary. Hence, solutions are not unique, and non-radial solutions exist. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). The answer is no. 

But wait, the problem is stated as &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|)&quot;, i.e., is it necessary that all solutions are radial? Since we can exhibit a non-radial solution, the answer is no. 

However, to be thorough, let me check another example. Suppose f(|x|) = 0. Then the equation is Δu = 0, harmonic functions in the unit ball. There are plenty of non-radial harmonic functions, like the coordinate functions x₁, x₂, etc. So even in the case f ≡ 0, which is a special case of the problem here, there are non-radial solutions. Hence, the answer is indeed no. 

Therefore, unless there are specific boundary conditions imposed (which there aren&#x27;t in the problem statement), the solution does not have to be radial. 

So the final answer is no, u(x) need not be expressible as v(|x|). Therefore, the answer is \boxed{No}. Wait, but the instructions say to put the final answer within \boxed{} and typically for yes/no questions in math, it might expect \boxed{\text{No}} or \boxed{\text{Yes}}. However, looking back, maybe the original problem is from a source where answers are boxed as statements. Wait, in the initial problem statement, the user wrote: &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v? Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}.&quot;

But in many math problem contexts, especially in PDEs, when they ask &quot;must u be expressible...&quot;, the answer is typically &quot;No&quot; because without boundary conditions, you can add non-radial harmonics. But maybe the question is trickier. Wait, is there a uniqueness theorem I&#x27;m missing here?

Wait, another thought: if the problem is in the unit ball and f is radial, perhaps even without boundary conditions, the equation Δu = f(|x|) only has radial solutions? But that can&#x27;t be, as we just constructed a non-radial solution by adding a non-radial harmonic function. So unless there is a condition that restricts solutions to be radial, the answer is no. 

Alternatively, maybe in some contexts, when you say &quot;solves the equation&quot; in the entire ball, maybe they consider distributional solutions or weak solutions with certain integrability conditions. But even so, the example I have in mind, adding x to a radial solution, would still be a weak solution, and x is in L²(B₁), for example. So even in Sobolev spaces, you can have non-radial solutions. 

Therefore, unless there&#x27;s a hidden assumption, the answer is no. So I think the answer is no, and the box should be \boxed{No}. But let me check standard references or theorems.

Wait, here&#x27;s a theorem: if a function satisfies Δu = 0 in a radially symmetric domain and u is radial, then u is radial. Wait, that&#x27;s not helpful. Alternatively, if the equation is rotationally invariant and the domain is rotationally invariant, then for each solution, its rotations are also solutions. Therefore, by averaging over rotations, you can obtain a radial solution. But that doesn&#x27;t mean all solutions are radial. 

Alternatively, the Poisson equation with radial inhomogeneity f(|x|) might have a radial particular solution, and then the homogeneous solutions (harmonic functions) can be added. Since harmonic functions can be non-radial, the general solution need not be radial. Therefore, the answer is no. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that u does not have to be radial. So the final answer is \boxed{No}.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{No}
&lt;/think&gt;

Given the equation \(\Delta u = f(|x|)\) in the unit ball \(B_1 \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) where \(f: [0, \infty) \to \mathbb{R}\) is a continuous function, we need to determine if the solution \(u(x)\) must be expressible as \(v(|x|)\) for some function \(v\).

1. **Laplacian in Spherical Coordinates**: For a radial function \(v(r)\), the Laplacian simplifies to \(\Delta v = v&#x27;&#x27;(r) + \frac{n-1}{r} v&#x27;(r)\). This shows that if \(u\) is radial, the Laplacian will be a function of \(r\) alone, matching \(f(|x|)\).

2. **Non-Uniqueness of Solutions**: Without boundary conditions, solutions to the Poisson equation \(\Delta u = f(|x|)\) are not unique. Any harmonic function (satisfying \(\Delta u = 0\)) can be added to a particular solution to yield another solution. Harmonic functions in the unit ball do not have to be radial (e.g., \(x_1, x_2, \ldots\) in \(\mathbb{R}^n\)).

3. **Example with Non-Radial Solution**: Consider \(f(|x|) = 1\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\). A particular solution is \(u_p(r) = \frac{r^2}{4}\), which is radial. Adding a non-radial harmonic function like \(h(x, y) = x\) results in a non-radial solution \(u = \frac{r^2}{4} + x\), which still satisfies \(\Delta u = 1\).

4. **Conclusion**: Since non-radial harmonic functions can be added to radial solutions, and harmonic functions are not necessarily radial, the solution \(u(x)\) does not have to be radial. The lack of boundary conditions allows for non-unique solutions, some of which are non-radial.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{No}\).          </p>

Reference Answer: Okay, so I have this problem here: If a function u solves the equation Δu = f(|x|) in the unit ball B₁ ⊂ ℝⁿ, where f is a continuous function from [0, ∞) to ℝ, must u(x) necessarily be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v? Hmm, interesting. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, let me recall what Δu means. That&#x27;s the Laplacian of u, right? So in n dimensions, the Laplacian operator is the sum of the second partial derivatives with respect to each coordinate. So Δu = ∂²u/∂x₁² + ∂²u/∂x₂² + ... + ∂²u/∂xₙ². 

Now, the equation given is Δu = f(|x|). The function f depends only on the radial distance |x| from the origin. So the right-hand side of the equation is radially symmetric. The question is whether the solution u must also be radially symmetric, i.e., expressible as v(|x|). 

I remember that for certain PDEs with radial symmetry in the equation or the domain, solutions can inherit that symmetry. For example, in electrostatics, the potential due to a spherically symmetric charge distribution is also spherically symmetric. But I need to verify if this is always the case here, or if there might be solutions that aren&#x27;t radial.

The domain here is the unit ball, which is a radially symmetric domain. The equation has a radially symmetric forcing term f(|x|). So maybe the solution must also be radially symmetric. But how can I be sure?

One approach might be to use the method of separation of variables or to look for solutions in polar coordinates. Since the problem is set in the unit ball, it might be helpful to express the Laplacian in spherical coordinates. In spherical coordinates, the Laplacian operator for a radial function v(r) simplifies significantly. Specifically, for a radial function v(r), where r = |x|, the Laplacian becomes Δv = v&#x27;&#x27;(r) + (n-1)/r * v&#x27;(r). So if u is radial, then Δu would just be a function of r, which matches the right-hand side f(r). 

But the question is whether any solution u must be radial. Suppose there exists a non-radial solution. Then, by some symmetry argument, maybe we can show that such a solution cannot exist. Alternatively, perhaps by the uniqueness of solutions to the Poisson equation with certain boundary conditions, the solution must be radial. However, the problem statement here doesn&#x27;t mention boundary conditions. Wait, that&#x27;s a point. The equation is Δu = f(|x|) in B₁, but no boundary conditions are specified. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that u is a solution without any specific boundary conditions, or perhaps considering the general case. But in PDEs, uniqueness usually comes with boundary conditions. Without boundary conditions, there might be multiple solutions. For example, you can add any harmonic function (satisfying Δu = 0) to a particular solution and get another solution. So if there&#x27;s a non-radial harmonic function, then adding it to a radial solution would give a non-radial solution. But harmonic functions on the unit ball don&#x27;t necessarily have to be radial. For instance, in 3D, the function x (or y, z) is harmonic but not radial. 

But wait, in that case, if we have a Poisson equation Δu = f(|x|) with no boundary conditions specified, then solutions are not unique. Therefore, there might exist both radial and non-radial solutions. But the question is phrased as &quot;must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|)&quot;, i.e., is every solution necessarily radial? If there exists a non-radial solution, then the answer is no. 

But maybe the problem is assuming some implicit boundary conditions, like Dirichlet or Neumann? Since the unit ball is a bounded domain, perhaps the question is considering solutions in a certain class, like classical solutions, but without boundary conditions, the answer might not be necessarily radial. However, maybe even without boundary conditions, the equation Δu = f(|x|) forces u to be radial. 

Wait, let&#x27;s think differently. Suppose we have two solutions u₁ and u₂ of Δu = f(|x|). Then their difference w = u₁ - u₂ satisfies Δw = 0. So w is harmonic. If we can show that all harmonic functions in B₁ must be radial, then all solutions would be radial. But harmonic functions are not necessarily radial. For example, in 2D, the real part of z^n for integer n is a harmonic function which is not radial. Therefore, unless we impose some boundary conditions like radial symmetry, harmonic functions can break the radial symmetry. 

Therefore, without boundary conditions, the solution u is not unique, and you can have non-radial solutions by adding non-radial harmonic functions. Therefore, the answer would be no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). 

But wait, hold on. Maybe the problem is posed in such a way that u is a solution without any specific mention of boundary conditions, but perhaps considering distributional solutions or something else. Wait, but even distributional solutions to Δu = f(|x|) would not be unique without boundary conditions. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the unique solution under certain boundary conditions, like Dirichlet conditions. For example, if you impose u = g on the boundary ∂B₁, then if g is radial, the solution would be radial. But if g is not radial, then the solution wouldn&#x27;t be radial. But the problem doesn&#x27;t specify boundary conditions. 

Wait, let me check the original problem statement again: &quot;If u solves the equation Δu = f(|x|) in the unit ball B₁ ⊂ ℝⁿ, where f: [0, ∞) → ℝ is a continuous function, must u(x) be expressible as v(|x|) for some function v?&quot; 

So the problem is just saying that u is a solution (without any specific boundary conditions). So given that, then as we discussed, solutions are not unique. Therefore, there can be non-radial solutions. So the answer would be no. 

But let me verify this with an example. Let&#x27;s take n=2 for simplicity. Suppose f(|x|) = 1, so Δu = 1 in the unit disk. A particular solution would be radial. For example, u_p(r) = (r²)/4. Because in polar coordinates, the Laplacian is u&#x27;&#x27; + (1/r) u&#x27;, so if u_p = (r²)/4, then u_p&#x27; = r/2, u_p&#x27;&#x27; = 1/2, so Δu_p = 1/2 + (1/r)(r/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which matches f(|x|)=1. So that&#x27;s a radial solution. 

However, we can add any harmonic function to u_p and still have a solution. For example, take a harmonic function like h(x, y) = x. Then u = u_p + h would be a solution: Δ(u_p + h) = Δu_p + Δh = 1 + 0 = 1. But u = (r²)/4 + x is not radial because x = r cosθ in polar coordinates, so u depends on θ as well. Therefore, this u is not expressible as a function of r alone. Therefore, such a solution is non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer is no, u does not have to be expressible as v(|x|). There exist solutions that are not radially symmetric. 

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering only bounded solutions or solutions with some regularity? But even so, in the example above, x is smooth and bounded in the unit ball. So even with smoothness, we can have non-radial solutions. 

Alternatively, perhaps if the problem had specified boundary conditions like u = 0 on the boundary, then maybe the solution would have to be radial. Let&#x27;s check that. Suppose we have Δu = f(|x|) with u = 0 on ∂B₁. Then, is the solution necessarily radial? 

In that case, maybe yes. Because the equation and the boundary condition are both radially symmetric, so by symmetry, the solution should also be radial. Let me recall the uniqueness of solutions for the Dirichlet problem. If you have a unique solution, and if the problem is invariant under rotations, then the solution must also be invariant under rotations, hence radial. 

So in the case where boundary conditions are specified and are radial, then the solution must be radial. But in the original problem, the user hasn&#x27;t specified any boundary conditions. Therefore, without boundary conditions, there are infinitely many solutions, some of which are non-radial. 

Therefore, the answer depends on whether boundary conditions are imposed.

Given the equation \(\Delta u = f(|x|)\) in the unit ball \(B_1 \subset \mathbb{R}^n\) where \(f: [0, \infty) \to \mathbb{R}\) is a continuous function, we need to determine if the solution \(u(x)\) must be expressible as \(v(|x|)\) for some function \(v\).

1. **Laplacian in Spherical Coordinates**: For a radial function \(v(r)\), the Laplacian simplifies to \(\Delta v = v&#x27;&#x27;(r) + \frac{n-1}{r} v&#x27;(r)\). This shows that if \(u\) is radial, the Laplacian will be a function of \(r\) alone, matching \(f(|x|)\).

Harmonic functions in the unit ball do not have to be radial (e.g., \(x_1, x_2, \ldots\) in \(\mathbb{R}^n\)).

3. **Example with Non-Radial Solution**: Consider \(f(|x|) = 1\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\). A particular solution is \(u_p(r) = \frac{r^2}{4}\), which is radial. Adding a non-radial harmonic function like \(h(x, y) = x\) results in a non-radial solution \(u = \frac{r^2}{4} + x\), which still satisfies \(\Delta u = 1\).

4. **Conclusion**: Since non-radial harmonic functions can be added to radial solutions, and harmonic functions are not necessarily radial, the solution \(u(x)\) does not have to be radial. The lack of boundary conditions allows for non-unique solutions, some of which are non-radial.

Problem: Alice and Bob both go to a party which starts at 5:00. Each of them arrives at a random time between 5:00 and 6:00. What is the probability that the number of minutes Alice is late for the party plus the number of minutes Bob is late for the party is less than 45? Express your answer as a common fraction. Write your answer in \boxed{} format.          </p>

Reference Answer: We let the $x$-axis represent the time Alice arrives at the party, and we let the $y$-axis represent the time Bob arrives at the party. Then we shade in the area where the number of minutes Alice is late for the party plus the number of minutes Bob is late for the party is less than 45.

If we let 1 unit be one minute, the area of the shaded region is $\frac{45^2}{2}$ square units and the whole area is 3600 square units. Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen point will land in the shaded region is $\frac{45^2}{2\cdot 3600}=\boxed{\frac{9}{32}}$.          </p>
